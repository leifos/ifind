<p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

<p>
    First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this experiment about online searching!<br />
    During this experiment we would like you to perform three different search tasks using the same search system.
</p>

<p>
<h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>For this experiment, imagine that you are a newspaper reporter, where you will need to write a story on two topics. To accomplished this you will need to search for information related to the topics.</li>
    </ul>

<h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Xinhua</em> newswires. The articles within the database range from 1996 to 2000. The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search engine, though there might be some slight differences to the search interface.</li>
    </ul>

<h2> <b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li>For each search task, you'll be given a short description of a topic and what information would be relevant to this topic.</li>
<br/>
    <li>You will begin posing queries and looking at results, just like you would in a web search engine. When looking at documents, you can mark whether a document is relevant to the given topic by clicking on a button. There are over 100 relevant documents in the database for each topic. Your job is to find as many of these as possible during the time allocated (approximately 20 minutes per task). </li>

</ul>

<h2><b>Goal and Incentive</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>As previously mentioned, <b>your goal is to find as many relevant documents as possible during the time allocated (approximately 20 minutes per task).</b> For each search task, the top three participants to identify the most relevant documents with the highest accuracy will be given a bonus payment of £5 on top of your initial payment of £10. </li>
<br/>
<li> You'll be in competition with 11 other people, and you will be able to claim up to 2 bonuses (i.e. one per search task, so you can earn an extra £10.)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>The experiment will take approximately one hour of your time.</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<hr/>
 
<h2><b>Experiment Outline</b></h2>
<p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about your demographics.</p>

<p>We'll then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the search interface by undertaking a practice task.</p>

<p>You'll then move onto the two main search tasks. Before each task, we'll ask you a few questions about your knowledge of the search topic. After you complete the task, we will ask you some questions about your search performance.</p>
    
<p> After you have performed each of the search tasks, we will ask you to complete a series of very short questionnaires about your search experience using the system provided to perform all the search tasks.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><b>Confirmation of Participation and Commitment</b></h2>

<p> If you have any questions, please ask the assistant now. Please remember that the data you provide will be anonymised, and will be used only for the purposes of this research.</p> 
<p><strong> If you are happy to undertake the experiment described above and committed to doing your best on the search tasks, then please click the <em>Next</em> button below.</strong></p>
