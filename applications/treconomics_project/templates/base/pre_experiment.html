<p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

<p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment about online searching.</p> 

<p> During this experiment we would like you to perform three different search tasks using the same search system.</p>

<h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>For this experiment imagine that you are a newspaper reporter, who needs to write a detailed report on the given topic.</li> 
    </ul>

<h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li> The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the New York Times, Associated Press and Xinhua newspapers from 1996 to 2000.</li>
    <li> The search system is similar to a web search engine; though there might be some differences to the search interface.</li> 
    </ul>

<h2> <b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li>For each search task you will be given a short description of a topic and what information would be relevant to this topic.</li>

    <li>When you view a particular newspaper article, we should mark whether you think the document is relevant to the topic.</li>
    <li>There are over 100 relevant documents in the database for each topic. Your job is to find as many of these as possible during the time allocated (approximately 10 minutes per task).</li>
    </ul>

<h2><b>Goal and Incentive</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Your goal is to find as many relevant documents as possible during the time allocated (approximately 10 minutes per task).</b></li>
<li>For each search task, the top three searchers to identify the  most relevant documents with the highest accuracy, will be given a bonus payment of £5. </li>
<li> There will be up to 11 other people in your group, and you will be able to claim up to 3 bonuses (i.e. one per search task) and earn up to £15 extra.</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<hr/>
 
<p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about your demographics and your search experience.</p>
 
<p>Before each search task, we will ask you a few questions about your knowledge of the search topic, while after the task we will ask you about your search performance.</p>
    
<p> After you have performed each of the search tasks, we will ask you to complete a series of very short questionnaires about your search experience using the system provided to perform all the search tasks.</p>

<p> If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.  </p>
