<p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

<p>
    First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this study! During the course of this study if you have any questions or wish to discontinue participating in this study,
    please let the study moderater know.

</p>
        <p>This study will take approximately 1.25 hours to complete.</p>

<p>
<h2><b>Scenario</b></h2>
        <p>You are working with a group of scholars who are investigating the differences in
            how several topics have been described in the news at, or near, the end of term for
            the last three U.S. presidents:  Clinton, Bush and Obama.
            You have been asked to focus on the news coverage of the topics during the final
            term of the Clinton administration, specifically 1996-2000.</p>

<p>You have set aside time today to <strong>create a list of news articles
    relevant to four topics</strong> that were published from <strong>1996-2000</strong>.</p>


<h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <p>You will search for relevant news articles using <strong>NewsSearch</strong>, an international news archive, that will
        show you articles published in <em>The New York Times, The Associated Press and Xinhua News Agency</em> between 1996 and 2000.</p>
<p>
The NewsSearch system looks similar to a web search engine.</p>
<p>
 <strong>When you view an article, you can mark the news article as relevant, and the
    NewSearch system adds it to your list of saved relevant news articles</strong>.
</p>



<h2> <b>Study Outline</b></h2>
    <p>So that you can get acquainted with the search system and the news archive,
        you will start with a <strong>practice task</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, you’ll move on to the <strong>four search tasks</strong>.</p>
<p>        For each search task, you will complete a <strong>pre-task questionnaire</strong> about the topic.
Then you will search for articles taking as much time as you need to create the lists of relevant articles.</p>
<p>        After your search, you will complete a <strong>post-task questionnaire</strong>
    about your experiences during the task.</p>
<p>After you have completed the fourth task, you will complete an <strong>exit questionnaire</strong>.</p>

 <p>       Once you have completed the exit questionnaire,
        please get the study moderator for the final interview and debriefing.
