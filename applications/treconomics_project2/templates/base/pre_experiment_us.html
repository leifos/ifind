<p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

<p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in this experiment about online searching.</p> 

<p> During this experiment we would like you to perform two different search tasks using the same search system.</p>

<h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>

    <ul>
    <li>For this experiment imagine that you are a newspaper reporter, who needs to write a detailed report on the given topic.</li> 
    </ul>

<h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li> The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the New York Times, Associated Press and Xinhua newspapers from 1996 to 2000.</li>
    <li> The search system is similar to a web search engine; though there might be some differences to the search interface.</li> 
    </ul>

<h2> <b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>    
    <li>For each search task you will be given a short description of a topic and what information would be relevant to this topic.</li>

    <li>When you view a particular newspaper article, please mark whether you think the document is relevant to the topic.</li>
    <li>There are over 100 relevant documents in the database for each topic.</li>
    </ul>

 
<hr/>
 
<p>Before you start searching, we would like to ask you a few questions about your demographics.</p>
 
<p>Before each search task, we will ask you a few questions about your knowledge of the search topic, while after the task we will ask you about your search performance.</p>
    
<p> After you have performed each of the search tasks, we will ask you to complete a series of very short questionnaires about your search experience.</p>

<p> If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter now.  </p>
