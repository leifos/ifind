    <p> <h1> Experiment Instructions </h1></p>

    <p>
        First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for agreeing to participate in this experiment about online
        searching!<br/>
        During this experiment we would like you to perform three different search tasks using the same search system.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2><b>Your Role</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For this experiment, imagine that you are a newspaper reporter, where you will need to write a story on
            three topics. In order to accomplish this you will need to search for related information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search System</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The search system that you will use connects to a database of about 1 million newspaper articles from the
            <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Xinhua</em> news agencies. The articles
            within the database range from 1999 to 2000. The search system you'll be using looks similar to a web search
            engine, though there might be some slight differences to the search interface.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>The Search Tasks</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For each search task, you'll be given a short description of a topic and what information would be relevant
            to this topic. This can be viewed by the <b>Shot Task</b> button at the top right-hand corner of the screen.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>You will pose queries and look at results, just like you would in a web search engine. When
            viewing documents, you can select the <b>Mark as Relevant</b> button when you find a document relevant to
            the topic. There are <b>over 100 relevant documents</b> in the database for each topic. Your job is to
            <b>find as many of these as possible</b> during the time allocated.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2><b>Goal and Incentive</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As previously mentioned, <b>your goal is to find as many relevant documents as possible during the time
            allocated (approximately 10 minutes per task).</b>
        </li>
        <li>As an additional incentive the person who identifies the most relevant documents will be given a new
            <b>iPod Nano</b></li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>The experiment will take approximately one hour of your time.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2><b>Experiment Outline</b></h2>
    <p> Before you start searching, we will ask you a few questions about you.</p>

    <p>We will then give you a few minutes to get comfortable with the search interface by undertaking a <b>practice
        task.</b></p>

    <p>You'll then move onto the <b>three main search tasks</b>.

        Before each task, you will complete a
        <b>pre-task questionnaire</b>
        about your knowledge of the search topic.

        After you complete the task, you will complete a
        <b>post-task questionnaire</b> about the search interface.</p>

    {#    <p> After you have performed each of the search tasks, we will ask you to complete a series of very <b>short#}
    {#        questionnaires</b> about your search experience using the system provided to perform all the search tasks.</p>#}

    <hr/>
