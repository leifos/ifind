ifind
=====

This library contains a series of components for search and search related operations.

You will need to add ifind to your PYTHONPATH.


Ifind contains a number of wrappers for different search services (e.g. Bing, Gov.uk, twitter, etc).

It provides a common way to construct a query (ifind.search.Query) and returns results in a common format (ifind.search.Response)

See the examples directory on how to instantiate different engines using the ifind.search.EngineFactory and how to issue a query.
