ifind
=====

This library contains a series of components for search and search related operations.

A number of wrappers for different search services have been implemented (Bing, Gov.uk, twitter, etc).

See the examples directory on how to instantiate different engines using the ifind.search.EngineFactory and how to issue a query.
