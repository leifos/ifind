Samaranch: performance of U.S. team key to Salt Lake success
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN WILSON  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ What's the recipe for success of the 2002
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City?
	   Simple _ medals, plenty of medals, for the home team.
	   That's the message from International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who says American athletes need
to make a big splash when the games return to U.S. soil in four
years.
	   Samaranch suggested Wednesday that the U.S. team needs to
improve on its 13-medal performance from this year's Nagano
Olympics in order to boost public enthusiasm for the games in the
host country.
	   ``Concern was expressed by (Samaranch) about the performance of
the U.S. team in 2002,'' said Frank Joklik, president of the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee. ``He feels the home team doing well is
an essential element of a successful Olympic Games. He is very
anxious to see a performance of a U.S.A. team that will be an
advance on what was achieved in Nagano.''
	   The 13 medals, including six gold, matched the best ever U.S.
performace at a winter games. But the total was still below
expectations.
	   U.S. Olympic Committee president William Hybl said the Ameicans
will definitely do better in 2002.
	   ``Based on what we know now, the USOC and myself are convinced
we will exceed the 13 medals we won in Nagano by some margin,'' he
said.
	   Hybl said he regarded Samaranch's remarks as ``encouragement''
for the work of the USOC's ``athlete's performance group,'' a panel
set up 10 months ago to improve America's medal chances at the 2000
Sydney Olympics and the Salt Lake City Games.
	   Samaranch noted that the success of the home team had played a
big part in generating excitement at the 1992 Barcelona Games, the
1994 Lillehammer Games and the 1998 Nagano Games.
	   ``Before Nagano there was some concern about public enthusiasm
for the games,'' IOC director general Francois Carrard said. ``As
soon as the Japanese did get very good results, the enthusiasm went
up.''
	   Samaranch delivered the same message to Australian organizers
during a visit to Sydney last month.
	   ``It's an important feature generally for every host city and
potential host city,'' Carrard said. ``Having a very strong team is
part of the success of the games.''
	   Another sign of successful games is the success of its mascot.
But Salt Lake City still doesn't have one.
	   The mascot was originally expected to be unveiled at the closing
ceremony in Nagano, but SLOC officials confirmed Wednesday the
mascot won't be ready before early 1999.
	   ``I don't think it's a hangup at all,'' Joklik said. ``It's one
of the issues that everyone wants a little input on. If we come up
with something early next year, we'll be in good shape.''
	   Joklik said Salt Lake was determined to avoid the experience of
Atlanta's much-maligned mascot. First called ``Whatizit,'' the
computer-generated blue mascot was presented to the world at the
closing ceremony in Barcelona in 1992 and was widely ridiculed as a
blob, slug, maggot and worse.
	   Stung by the response, Atlanta organizers redesigned the mascot
into a more child-friendly creature named ``Izzy.'' While popular
with kids, the mascot continued to be the butt of jokes and
criticism in the world's media.
	   ``Definitely, we don't want to do that,'' Joklik said. ``I hope
we come up with a better name than `Whatizit.' And we hope it will
be very plain what (the mascot) is.'''
	   Despite the delays, Joklik said, presenting the mascot three
years before the games gives organizers plenty of time to take
advantage of merchandise sales.
	   On the sports program for 2002, SLOC vice president Dave Johnson
said discussions were continuing on the possible inclusion of
women's bobsledding. But he said there now appeared little chance
of adding women's ski jumping and indicated that skeleton _ a
head-first version of luge _ may not be included as previously
expected.

	   DENVER (AP) _ Vinny Castilla hit a two-run homer in the bottom
of the ninth inning to push Colorado past Arizona.
	   After Larry Walker hit a leadoff double off closer Gregg Olson
(1-3), Castilla followed with his 22nd homer, which barely cleared
the wall in left-center. Castilla has homered in four straight
games.
	   Chuck McElroy (2-1) pitched 1 1-3 shutout innings for Colorado,
which had dropped the previous two games in this series to the
expansion Diamondbacks.
	   Travis Lee's solo homer in the sixth gave Arizona a 2-1 lead.

Pacific may become haven for child sex abusers, authorities warn
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT KEITH-REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ The tolerant attitudes and relative innocence
of Pacific Islanders, combined with the isolation of their
communities, make the region an appealing prospective ``safe
haven'' for foreign child sex abusers, authorities warned Thursday.
	   Fear that the Pacific will become an alternative to Asian
brothel centers has prompted governments and child protection
agencies to coordinate a regional response.
	   Government, police and social service officials from 12 Pacific
Island countries met in Suva this week to design a plan to nip in
the bud the development of a commercial child sex trade.
	   Greg Urwin, Australia's senior diplomat in Fiji, told the
conference recent efforts to combat the child sex trade in Asia has
prompted abusers to look for alternatives.
	   ``(They) seem more inclined to look at this (Pacific Island)
region, where perhaps controls may be perceived to be less
stringent, where society generally may be perceived as more
tolerant and relaxed and where the innocence of children and
families may seem more easily exploitable,'' Urwin said. Australia
funded the conference.
	   Christine Beddoe, of Australian non-government organization End
Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking, said there were
definite indicators of a child sex trade beginning in Samoa,
Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Fiji and ``high risk indicators''
in Tonga.
	   However, except for a few proven cases involving children in
Fiji and the Solomon Islands, evidence indicating the spread of
commercial child prostitution remains largely anecdotal.
	   Resolutions from the conference include agreements on greater
collaboration between police, governments and communities in each
country, the introduction of stringent anti-child abuse laws, the
need for heightened public awareness and the establishment a
regional network to identify and combat child prostitution.
	   Urwin said an absence of effective anti-abuse legislation and
effective enforcement needed to be urgently remedied.
	   Urwin said Australia and Fiji has just signed protocols for
tighter control of child adoption procedures, for improved
treatment for young victims of sexual, physical and mental abuse
and for exchanges of information.

Victims still buried in smashed German train; at least 100 dead

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescuers at Germany's deadliest postwar
train wreck worked with cranes and floodlights early Thursday to
uncover victims buried when a high-speed train derailed, jackknifed
and smashed broadside into an overpass.
	   State officials said at least 100 people were killed in
Wednesday's accident at Eschede in northern Germany, along the
Munich-to-Hamburg line. Scores were injured.
	   The lead locomotive of the Inter-City Express broke loose at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour, leaving behind 12 passenger cars
and another locomotive that jumped tracks and crunched together
like an accordion.
	   The pileup undermined the bridge, and two first-class cars were
wedged underneath when the concrete structure crashed down during
the chaotic accident. Other cars were stacked lengthwise in front
of the collapsed overpass.
	   As dawn broke Thursday, emergency workers still struggled with
the delicate task of lifting huge chunks of the overpass with
cranes to reach the two buried cars, where rescuers expected to
find more bodies. Rescuers were concerns that the cars would break
apart in the operation.
	   Eighty-one bodies had been recovered, and two victims had died
from their injuries in hospitals, crisis management spokesman
Hans-Helmut Schmitz said. Police said hospitals had reported 95
people injured, lower than earlier estimates of 120.
	   Military tanks pulled the rear locomotive away from the
wreckage, as search dogs sniffed through other train parts for
remaining survivors.
	   It remained unclear why the first locomotive, which went through
the bridge unscathed, had decoupled and why the rest of the train
derailed.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle ahead of the accident, which subsided but then
restarted just before the impact.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said Wednesday.
``Thank God, it came to a standstill.''
	   As screams rang out from the wounded, dazed survivors had
staggered with bloodied hands toward residents who came running out
of houses just 50 yards (150 feet) away. Splintered glass covered
the ground after the late-morning accident.
	   Within an hour, rescue workers swarmed to the scene, and
helicopters began bringing the wounded to regional hospitals.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the country's deadliest train accident since World War II.
	   The Lower Saxony state interior ministry, which said at least
100 people were dead, had earlier estimated that as many as 300 or
more were injured.
	   The accounting of dead and injured was hampered by the severity
of the mangled mess and because authorities were unsure how many
people had been on board the train.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, informed of the tragedy after arriving
in Italy for meetings with Premier Romano Prodi, appeared shaken by
the news and called his visit short.
	   ``So many dead ... It's a tragedy,'' Kohl, his face tight, said
Wednesday in Bologna with Prodi at his side. ``Excuse me, but I
must return home right away.
	   Hundreds of people, moved by word of the tragedy, gathered at
Red Cross stations across the country to donate blood.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   The locomotive driver, oblivious to the catastrophe behind him,
had kept driving through the small train station at Eschede, 35
miles north of Hanover.
	   The station master finally hit the emergency brakes, bringing
the engine to a halt more than a mile from the overpass.
	   The ICE train connects all major cities at speed up to 280
kilometers (175 miles) an hour, cutting travel time from Munich to
Hamburg - a distance of more than 950 kilometers (about 600 miles)
by more than two hours.
	   The Munich-Hamburg train that crashed Wednesday was a
first-generation ICE model powered by two electric-powered
locomotives, and with a capacity of 759 passengers.
	   At top speed the train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to
come to an emergency stop.

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ John Stockton atoned for missing a
last-second shot in regulation by scoring seven points in overtime
as the Utah Jazz defeated the Chicago Bulls 88-85 Wednesday in the
opening game of the National Basketball Association Finals
	   In a sloppy game that seemed to take forever to be decided, the
Bulls missed a chance to steal a game and wrest homecourt advantage
away from the Jazz.
	   That's because Stockton made all the big plays in overtime,
Scottie Pippen missed a tying 3-pointer at the buzzer and the Jazz
walked off leading the series _ something they never did in last
year's finals.
	   Stockton ended up shooting 9-for-12 from the floor for 24 points
with eight assists and two steals. Karl Malone added 21 points and
Bryon Russell had 15 to help Utah overcome 33 points from Michael
Jordan.
	   Stockton started his overtime flurry with an assist to Malone
for a layup that broke a 79-all tie.
	   Pippen, yelled at by Jordan late in the fourth quarter for
rushing a 3-point shot, then had the ball poked away by Jeff
Hornacek as he drove to his right. Stockton gathered the loose ball
and went in for a three-point play that put Utah ahead 84-79.
	   Jordan made one of two free throws and a jumper to cut the
deficit to two with 2:07 left, but the Bulls would not score for
another two minutes.
	   With 43 seconds left and the ball in Chicago's hands, it ended
up going to Luc Longley. He tried going to the hoop and had the
ball deflected away for Chicago's third turnover of overtime. Bryon
Russell recovered, the Jazz ran the clock down and Stockton made
the shot of the game.
	   Guarded by the slow-footed Steve Kerr, Stockton drove to his
right, jumped off the wrong foot and made the shot from about 10
feet (three meters) away.
	   Toni Kukoc hit a 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left, and Stockton
made two free throws with 3.5 seconds left to give the Jazz another
three-point lead.
	   ``They just kept coming back. We're going to have to play better
than that if we're going to win this thing,'' Stockton said.
	   The Bulls fired the ensuing inbounds pass upcourt and tipped it
to Pippen at the 3-point line, but his shot was too long.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pollution at the 2000 Olympic Games
site was the worst in Sydney and local residents suffered higher
cancer, heart and respiratory disease than the average Sydneysider,
according to a report released Thursday.
	   Environmental watchdog Green Games Watch 2000 (GGW) warned the
problems would get worse if the state government did not act before
thousands of new residents moved into the area after the games.
	   ``It's the most polluted area in Sydney,'' GGW coordinator Peggy
James said. ``Some have called it the dioxin capital of the world.
I'm not sure that's true.''

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Commuters taking the Inter-City Express
train along the Munich-to-Hamburg line are normally assured of a
smooth ride in business-class size reclining seats.
	   The train _ which travels up to 175 mph (280 kph) _ feels
motionless, allowing passengers to tap out reports on laptops, sip
coffee or doze undisturbed during their trip.
	   That's why passengers on Germany's fastest train were so alarmed
Wednesday by the rattling.
	   ``I had the feeling that maybe something was lying on the
tracks,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, a passenger from a rear car,
told SAT 1 TV.
	   ``People looked at each other shocked, and then it was as if:
`That's over now.''' But then the rattling ``started up again,'' he
said.
	   A moment later, the train's lead locomotive somehow broke loose
and car after car jumped off the track, crumpling into each other
and slamming into a bridge, bringing it down on top of the
wreckage.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Schliebener said. ``Thank God, it came to
a standstill.''
	   Then he heard the screaming.
	   Several passenger cars had wedged together, some sticking up at
bizarre angles and others buried under the overpass.
	   The train was traveling at 125 mph (200 kph) when it crashed.
Authorities said at least 100 people died; rescuers pulled out more
than 70 bodies by late Wednesday night.
	   Dazed survivors staggered with bloodied hands toward residents
who came running out of houses just 150 feet (45 meters) away.
Splintered glass covered the ground.
	   Within an hour the nearby small, red-brick town of Eschede _
about 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of Hanover _ was swarming with
fire trucks, rescue workers and volunteers.
	   Hannelore Domkewitz saw the train speed past from her kitchen
window where she stood peeling potatoes. She had just a moment to
reflect that it was moving faster than usual.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Domkewitz said.
	   The silence didn't last long. There were screams from the
tracks, about 300 feet (90 meters) away.
	   Domkewitz ran to get blankets and bed sheets to cover the
injured and dead. ``But there were also survivors who went by with
their luggage. They were all in shock,'' Domkewitz said, her voice
breaking.

Dissidents, disgraced reformer watched on Tiananmen anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents and a disgraced Communist Party
reformer drew intensified police scrutiny as plainclothes officers
closely watched Beijing's Tiananmen Square Thursday, the ninth
anniversary of the armed quelling of massive democracy protests.
	   Police quickly pounced on two men, one in a wheelchair, who
threw leaflets in the air near the obelisk Monument to the People's
Heroes at the heart of the vast square.
	   Although their protest seemingly had no connection to the
anniversary _ the leaflets demanded compensation for a crippling
shooting in southeastern Fujian province _ the police reaction
shows how sensitive the bloody end to the popular protest movement
remains nine years on.
	   About two dozen dissidents have been rounded up nationwide to
prevent commemorations of the protests and the military assault
that ended them on June 4, 1989. Hundreds if not thousands were
killed in Beijing and thousands more arrested in the ensuing
crackdown.
	   Chinese leaders have feared ever since that the anniversary will
be used to rally opposition to their rule. A summit between the
Chinese and U.S. presidents in late June and fears of unrest among
millions of laid-off state industrial workers have added to their
usual concerns.
	   The leadership has tightened the house arrest of former party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, seen as a worrisome reminder of the
1989 protests, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Thursday.
	   Zhao's occasional morning walks and visits to friends may not be
done without permission of the party Central Committee, the group
said.
	   Zhao engineered some of China's most crucial economic reforms
and presided over a period of political openness that inspired the
student-led demonstrations. Removed by party elders for resisting
the crackdown, Zhao still inspires dissidents and reform-minded
party officials.
	   Human rights campaigner Lin Xinshu complained Thursday two
plainclothes police officers have been stationed outside his door
for at least two days to watch his movements.
	   Police and soldiers maintained an obvious presence in Tiananmen
Square. Soldiers drilled with Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles
near the Great Hall of the People off the square's western fringe.
Plainclothes police held two-way radios as they patrolled.
	   While Beijing's universities, which were in the forefront of the
1989 protests, have been quiet, fears persist that students may
once again take up the cause of democracy. Professors and think
tank researchers have recently begun pushing for political reform
in a volume not heard since 1989.
	   An article in the state-run China Daily, ostensibly about
Beijing University in the aftermath of its centennial celebrations
last month, however, sent a clear political message.
	   ``We don't need any campaigns, just practical work,'' university
party chief Ren Yanshan was quoted as saying.

	   NICOLAS RUIZ, Mexico (AP) _ One thousand police officers and
soldiers swarmed into this small southern Mexican town early
Wednesday, firing tear gas, breaking down doors and arresting 167
rebel sympathizers they said had ``held the town hostage.''
	   People scattered through the streets and hundreds fought police
with poles during a raid that Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen insisted
was intended only to ``bring the town into conformity with the
law.''
	   ``We don't care if they're sympathizers of the Zapatista
National Liberation Army or if they're Muslims. All we care about
is that they respect the law,'' he said in a telephone interview
from the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   The governor said the raid was peaceful, but television images
showed state police kicking people and beating them with wooden
poles. One image showed the face of a villager covered in blood.
Authorities said no one was injured, but townsfolk said dozens of
people were hurt, most of them by tear gas.
	   Some of the officers carried assault rifles, and they broke down
doors to drag suspects from their beds in the early morning raid.
Helicopters flew overhead.
	   Late Wednesday, the government news agency Notimex reported that
151 of the 167 people arrested had been released. Six men were
charged with illegal detention and the other 10 were being held
until they could appear before a judge, the report said.
	   Notimex also reported that 41 police officers were injured, five
of them seriously, when a tire on their vehicle blew out after they
left Nicolas Ruiz. The cause of the blowout was under
investigation.
	   The raid was similar to two others carried out in the last two
months in the villages of Taniperlas and Agua Tinta, both
sympathetic to the Zapatistas.
	   Twelve foreigners were arrested and deported during the
Taniperlas raid, and a group of Italians who denounced alleged
human rights abuses during the raid were later deported for
visiting the village without permission.
	   Albores Guillen denied that Nicolas Ruiz supported the rebels,
blaming a ``small minority'' of the town's residents for
intimidating the rest of the town of 8,000 people, 60 miles (100
kilometers) east of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   He said that group didn't allow others to choose their political
parties, denied them religious freedom, made unilateral decisions
and wouldn't allow the government into the town to build a road and
a health clinic.
	   Most of the people arrested were supporters of the leftist
opposition Democratic Revolution Party. Albores Guillen said the
raid came only after they refused to negotiate.
	   The rebels staged a brief uprising in 1994, demanding greater
rights for Mexico's poor Indians. Peace talks stalled after the
government backed off of a treaty the two sides had signed on
greater Indian autonomy.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Sixteen women farm workers died and two others
are missing after their overloaded wooden boat capsized in
southeastern China, the official China Youth Daily reported
Thursday.
	   Some 26 women from Kangwei village in Fujian province set out in
a wooden boat built to hold 12 to pick young soy beans before dawn
on Tuesday, the newspaper said.
	   The boat capsized shortly after leaving shore. All but two of
the 18 people missing from the accident have been accounted for.
One of those missing, boat driver Zhan Xibi, was said to have
climbed on to shore and is suspected by police of fleeing, the
newspaper said.

Indonesia's ruling political party in crisis as reforms roll on
</HEADLINE>
  By GEOFF SPENCER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With sweeping reform blowing fast over
Indonesia's once rigid political landscape, ex-President Suharto's
ruling Golkar party is in crisis ahead of promised free elections
next year.
	   At least two of its major factions are splitting away to form
new political parties. An emergency congress of Golkar officials
next month is expected to dump its once powerful leadership,
including its chief patron, Suharto himself.
	   Some suggest that the monolithic group might crumble over the
next few months.
	   For more than two decades, Golkar dominated Indonesia's
tightly-controlled system of government, set up by the autocratic
Suharto in the 1970s.
	   It was strongly supported by the powerful military and, by law,
all of Indonesia's hundreds of thousands of government employees
were required to be Golkar members.
	   With such a huge party machine, it consistently won general
elections every five years, competing against only two other
officially-sanctioned minority parties. Unlike its weaker rivals,
it was able to stage massive rallies around the country to garner
support.
	   Sports stadiums and whole neighborhoods were sometimes bedecked
in the party's bright yellow flags and banners.
	   Under Golkar's dominance, the national Parliament never failed
to rubber stamp Suharto's policies.
	   At the most recent ballot, it won more than 70 percent of the
vote.
	   Suharto ended his 32-year autocratic rule on May 21, resigning
after a wave of violent protest shook the world's fourth most
populous nation, suffering its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has lifted old restrictions on the
formation of political parties and perhaps dozens will be formed
before elections are held in 1999.
	   ``Golkar was set up to help keep Suharto in power. It doesn't
have a reason to exist anymore,'' said Arbi Sanit, a political
scientist from the University of Indonesia.
	   Twenty-three out of 27 regional branches of the party decided at
a meeting Wednesday to hold a congress next month to decide the
party's future.
	   Newspapers in Jakarta speculated Thursday that Parliament
Speaker Harmoko, a former Suharto Cabinet minister who helped
convince Suharto to resign last month, might be forced to quit as
party chairman.
	   Suharto's eldest daughter ``Tutut'' Siti Hardijanti Rukmana,
another dumped Cabinet minister, will probably lose her position as
a senior party leader.
	   The Jakarta Post reported that July's Golkar congress would
decide whether to scrap its once influential board of patrons,
headed by Suharto.

  Jazz 88, Bulls 85, OT  
  By CHRIS SHERIDAN  
  AP Basketball Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ John Stockton atoned for missing a
last-second shot in regulation by scoring seven points in overtime
as the Utah Jazz defeated the Chicago Bulls 88-85 Wednesday in the
opening game of the National Basketball Association Finals.
	   In a sloppy game that seemed to take forever to be decided, the
Bulls missed a chance to steal a game and wrest homecourt advantage
away from the Jazz.
	   ``You couldn't ever ask for a better opportunity to win on their
court,'' Chicago coach Phil Jackson lamented. ``I feel like we let
one slip away.''
	   That's because Stockton made all the big plays in overtime and
Scottie Pippen missed a tying 3-pointer at the buzzer. And the Jazz
walked off leading the series, something they never did in last
year's finals.
	   Stockton ended up shooting 9-for-12 from the floor for 24 points
with eight assists and two steals. Karl Malone added 21 points and
Bryon Russell had 15 to help Utah overcome 33 points from Michael
Jordan.
	   Stockton started his overtime flurry with an assist to Malone
for a layup that broke a 79-all tie.
	   Pippen, yelled at by Jordan late in the fourth quarter for
rushing a 3-point shot, then had the ball poked away by Jeff
Hornacek as he drove to his right. Stockton gathered the loose ball
and went in for a three-point play that put Utah ahead 84-79.
	   Jordan made one of two free throws and a jumper to cut the
deficit to two with 2:07 left, but the Bulls would not score for
another two minutes.
	   With 43 seconds left and the ball in Chicago's hands, it ended
up going to Luc Longley. He tried going to the hoop and had the
ball deflected away for Chicago's third turnover of overtime. Bryon
Russell recovered, the Jazz ran the clock down and Stockton made
the shot of the game.
	   Guarded by the slow-footed Steve Kerr, Stockton drove to his
right, jumped off the wrong foot and made the shot from about 10
feet (three meters) away.
	   Toni Kukoc hit a 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left, and Stockton
made two free throws with 3.5 seconds left to give the Jazz another
three-point lead.
	   ``They just kept coming back. We're going to have to play better
than that if we're going to win this thing,'' Stockton said.
	   The Bulls fired the ensuing inbounds pass upcourt and tipped it
to Pippen at the 3-point line, but his shot was too long.
	   ``Stock's got the ice water in his veins,'' Russell said. ``You
know he wants that ring. Stock took over that game.''
	   Coming off 10 days rest and playing a Bulls team that was
extended to seven games by Indiana in the Eastern Conference
finals, the Jazz led most of the game but could never pull ahead by
more than eight.
	   They kept Jordan somewhat in check, limiting him to 13-for-29
shooting.
	   Pippen shot only 7-for-19 with five turnovers, Kukoc was
4-for-12 and Chicago's reserves scored only eight points.
	   The Jazz got 22 points from the bench, including eight by Howard
Eisley, outscored Chicago 52-34 in the paint and 21-6 on fast-break
points.
	   Neither team could generate much offense in the fourth quarter,
except for when Malone got up a head of steam and headed for the
hoop. His fast-break dunk with 5:57 left ended a long scoreless
drought, and his dunk with 4:44 left put Utah ahead 73-66.
	   That's when Jordan got hot again. He scored on two jumpers, both
of which hit nothing but net, and a 3-pointer by Pippen tied the
game 75-all with 2:34 left.
	   After Dennis Rodman blocked a shot by Malone, Pippen rushed a
3-pointer and got an earful from Jordan.
	   With Chicago down by two, Pippen grabbed an offensive rebound _
Chicago's ninth and last of the game _ and called timeout with 23.6
seconds left on the game clock and 23 left on the shot clock.
	   It was no surprise when Jordan got the ball, but Chicago didn't
hold for the last shot. Instead, Jordan penetrated and passed over
to Luc Longley, who made a short jumper from the lane to tie the
game 79-79 with 14.3 seconds left.
	   The Jazz inbounded with 7.3 seconds left and Stockton headed for
the right corner, where his jumper from 3-point range came up just
short.

United 4 beats Clash 0; Mutiny tops MetroStars 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Jaime Moreno and Ben Olsen each
scored a goal and added an assist to lead D.C. United to a 4-0
victory against the San Jose Clash on Wednesday night.
	   Moreno began the scoring in the 41st minute on a penalty kick
awarded when Richard Gough fouled Richard Williams inside the
penalty area. Moreno who leads D.C. United with six goals and eight
assists.
	   Moreno helped set up United's second goal by chipping a diagonal
pass over the Clash defense to Olsen, who sent a header inside the
far post.
	   Williams and Tony Sanneh added two more goals in the second half
to put the game away for the two-time defending champions.
	   Williams stole a Clash pass and scored in the 65th minute.
Sanneh scored with an assist by Olsen two minutes after San Jose's
Vincente Figueroa received a red card for a rough tackle on
Lassiter.
	   United goalkeeper Scott Garlick made four saves to earn his
third shutout of the season. San Jose goalkeeper Andy Kirk has
surrendered eight goals in two games after back-to-back shutouts.
  Mutiny 2, MetroStars 1
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Musa Shannon scored 21 minutes
into the second half and the Tampa Bay Mutiny defeated New York-New
Jersey 2-1 Wednesday night despite giving up an MLS record 38 shots
to the MetroStars.
	   Mutiny goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli was spectacular, making 10
saves. Steve Ralston got the other goal as Tampa Bay ended a
three-game losing streak and won for only the third time in 14
games.
	   Paul Dougherty scored in the 38th minute for the MetroStars, who
had a scary moment early in the second half when keeper Tony Meola
slammed his head into a goalpost making a diving save. The former
United State national keeper stayed on the grass for five minutes
but finished the game, facing 17 shots.
	   Meola made two outstanding saves over the next few minutes, but
he did not have a chance on Shannon's sixth goal of the season,
which ended the MetroStars' three-game winning streak.
	   Gilmar settled the ball in the left side of the penalty box and
sent a crossing pass that Shannon, going in from the left wing,
one-timed past Meola.
	   The old record for shots in a game was 31 by Columbus on July
13, 1997, in a 2-1 loss to Dallas.
	   The MetroStars also set a single-half record with 22 shots in
the first half, but they left the field tied at 1-1.
	   Dougherty scored in the 38th minute on a curling shot from the
top of the box that beat Ravelli into the top right corner.
	   Tampa Bay tied the game three minutes later when Shannon and
Alan Prampin beat a trap by the MetroStars' defense. Shannon nudged
the ball past a sliding Meola and Prampin sent a crossing pass to
Ralston for a flick into an empty net.

Rights groups call for the release of more Indonesian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Human rights groups in Australia on
Thursday backed demands for Indonesia's new government to
immediately release political prisoners and reform the legal
system.
	   ``President Habibie ... must demonstrate an immediate commitment
to human rights by substantive prisoner releases and by repealing
the repressive laws which were used over the last three decades to
imprison peaceful opposition activists,'' Amnesty International
Australia and Human Rights Watch said in a joint statement.
	   The organizations also called for a review of the convictions
against all political prisoners accused of using violence.
	   The recent release of four high profile political prisoners was
a welcome gesture, but dozens more remained in jail, the statement
said.
	   ``President Habibie must go much further if his government is to
gain the trust of the Indonesian people on its program of reform.''
	   At least 47 Indonesian and East Timorese people remained in jail
because of their peaceful opposition to former president Suharto's
government.
	   The groups also called on the Indonesian government to step up
efforts to find Indonesian activists still missing.

Victims still buried in smashed German train; at least 100 dead

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescuers at Germany's deadliest postwar
train wreck worked with cranes and floodlights early Thursday to
uncover victims buried when a high-speed train derailed, jackknifed
and smashed broadside into an overpass.
	   State officials said at least 100 people were killed in
Wednesday's accident at Eschede in northern Germany, along the
Munich-to-Hamburg line. Scores were injured.
	   The lead locomotive of the Inter-City Express broke loose at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour, leaving behind 12 passenger cars
and another locomotive that jumped tracks and crunched together
like an accordion.
	   The pileup undermined the bridge, and two first-class cars were
wedged underneath when the concrete structure crashed down during
the chaotic accident. Other cars were stacked lengthwise in front
of the collapsed overpass.
	   As dawn broke Thursday, emergency workers still struggled with
the delicate task of lifting huge chunks of the overpass with
cranes to reach the two buried cars, where rescuers expected to
find more bodies. One of cars was a dining carriage. Rescuers were
concerned the cars might break apart in the operation.
	   ``We think the chances of finding further survivors are very
small,'' police spokesman Peter Hoppe said.
	   Eighty-one bodies had been recovered, and two victims died from
their injuries in hospitals, crisis management spokesman
Hans-Helmut Schmitz said. Police said hospitals had reported 95
people injured.
	   Military tanks pulled the rear locomotive away from the
wreckage, as search dogs sniffed through other train parts for
remaining survivors.
	   It remained unclear why the first locomotive, which went through
the bridge unscathed, had decoupled and why the rest of the train
derailed.
	   An investigation continued into the cause, though it was ``not
as intensive'' as recovery efforts, Hoppe said. There has been no
indication yet that the derailment was anything other than an
accident, he said.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle ahead of the accident, which subsided but then
restarted just before the impact.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said Wednesday.
``Thank God, it came to a standstill.''
	   As screams rang out from the wounded, dazed survivors had
staggered with bloodied hands toward residents who came running out
of houses just 50 yards (150 feet) away. Splintered glass covered
the ground after the late-morning accident.
	   Within an hour, rescue workers swarmed to the scene, and
helicopters began bringing the wounded to regional hospitals.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the country's deadliest train accident since World War II.
	   The Lower Saxony state interior ministry, which said at least
100 people were dead, had earlier estimated that as many as 300 or
more were injured.
	   The accounting of dead and injured was hampered by the severity
of the mangled mess and because authorities were unsure how many
people had been on board the train.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, informed of the tragedy after arriving
in Italy for meetings with Premier Romano Prodi, appeared shaken by
the news and called his visit short.
	   ``So many dead ... It's a tragedy,'' Kohl, his face tight, said
Wednesday in Bologna with Prodi at his side. ``Excuse me, but I
must return home right away.
	   Hundreds of people, moved by word of the tragedy, gathered at
Red Cross stations across the country to donate blood.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   The locomotive driver, oblivious to the catastrophe behind him,
had kept driving through the small train station at Eschede, 35
miles north of Hanover.
	   The station master finally hit the emergency brakes, bringing
the engine to a halt more than a mile from the overpass.
	   The ICE train connects all major cities at speed up to 280
kilometers (175 miles) an hour, cutting travel time from Munich to
Hamburg - a distance of more than 950 kilometers (about 600 miles)
by more than two hours.
	   The Munich-Hamburg train that crashed Wednesday was a
first-generation ICE model powered by two electric-powered
locomotives, and with a capacity of 759 passengers.
	   At top speed the train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to
come to an emergency stop.

	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Jaime Moreno and Ben Olsen each
scored a goal and added an assist to lead D.C. United to a 4-0
victory against the San Jose Clash on Wednesday night.
	   Moreno began the scoring in the 41st minute on a penalty kick
awarded when Richard Gough fouled Richard Williams inside the
penalty area. Moreno who leads D.C. United with six goals and eight
assists.
	   Moreno helped set up United's second goal by chipping a diagonal
pass over the Clash defense to Olsen, who sent a header inside the
far post.
	   Williams and Tony Sanneh added two more goals in the second half
to put the game away for the two-time defending champions.
	   Williams stole a Clash pass and scored in the 65th minute.
Sanneh scored with an assist by Olsen two minutes after San Jose's
Vicente Figueroa received a red card for a rough tackle on Roy
Lassiter.
	   United goalkeeper Scott Garlick made five saves to earn his
third shutout of the season. San Jose goalkeeper Andy Kirk has
surrendered eight goals in two games after back-to-back shutouts.
  Mutiny 2, MetroStars 1
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Musa Shannon scored 21 minutes
into the second half and the Tampa Bay Mutiny defeated New York-New
Jersey 2-1 Wednesday night despite giving up an MLS record 38 shots
to the MetroStars.
	   Mutiny goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli was spectacular, making 10
saves. Steve Ralston got the other goal as Tampa Bay ended a
three-game losing streak and won for only the third time in 14
games.
	   Paul Dougherty scored in the 38th minute for the MetroStars, who
had a scary moment early in the second half when keeper Tony Meola
slammed his head into a goalpost making a diving save. The former
United State national keeper stayed on the grass for five minutes
but finished the game, facing 17 shots.
	   Meola made two outstanding saves over the next few minutes, but
he did not have a chance on Shannon's sixth goal of the season,
which ended the MetroStars' three-game winning streak.
	   Gilmar settled the ball in the left side of the penalty box and
sent a crossing pass that Shannon, going in from the left wing,
one-timed past Meola.
	   The old record for shots in a game was 31 by Columbus on July
13, 1997, in a 2-1 loss to Dallas.
	   The MetroStars also set a single-half record with 22 shots in
the first half, but they left the field tied at 1-1.
	   Dougherty scored in the 38th minute on a curling shot from the
top of the box that beat Ravelli into the top right corner.
	   Tampa Bay tied the game three minutes later when Shannon and
Alan Prampin beat a trap by the MetroStars' defense. Shannon nudged
the ball past a sliding Meola and Prampin sent a crossing pass to
Ralston for a flick into an empty net.

Indonesian military helicopter crashes, killing 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military helicopter crashed in bad
weather Thursday in the disputed territory of East Timor, killing
two top regional commanders and nine other top officers and
soldiers.
	   One man survived the crash with serious injuries, the official
Antara news agency reported.
	   The helicopter exploded after plunging into a mountain, military
Lt. Col. Supardi said in a telephone interview from Dili, capital
of the former Portuguese colony. It was raining at the time, and
visibility was poor.
	   The victims included Maj. Gen. Yudomo, the military commander
for eastern Indonesia, including East Timor, and Col. Slamet
Sidabutar, commander in the territory.
	   Hampered by the rough terrain, rescue workers headed to the
remote site of the crash near Viqueque, about 110 miles (180
kilometers) east of Dili.
	   The city is 1,200 miles (1,920 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   Separatist rebels often clash with soldiers in the area, but
there was no indication that they had shot down the helicopter.
	   The Indonesian military invaded East Timor in 1975, and has
maintained a heavy presence there ever since. Indonesia declared
the territory its 27th province in 1976, but a small band of
guerrillas who want independence continue to fight.
	   Despite growing calls for democratic reform, new President B.J.
Habibie said this week that Indonesia would not relinquish control
over East Timor.

Government minister feels pinch of water crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The home of the federal minister
who monitors waterworks went dry as rationing was extended to a new
neighborhood despite heavy rains, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``I have not received water for the last three days in my house
and I have to bathe with a small bucket,'' Works Minister Samy
Vellu said.
	   Rains that drenched Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs were so heavy
that roofs of some houses were damaged, but failed to bring
immediate relief to nearly 2 million residents who have had to
depend on water carted in trucks for three months.
	   With the drop in the Bukit Nanas water treatment plant, supply
in the upscale Bangsar neighborhood _ so far immune to rationing _
was affected on Wednesday, the Star daily said.
	   The rains on Tuesday and Wednesday, however, may have stalled an
emergency plan to cut supplies further in many areas to 12 hours of
water once in three days, the daily said.
	   The plan might have been put into action if it had not rained,
said V. Subramaniam of the Selangor Waterworks Department.
	   But Vellu said he was surprised that the showers had not
improved water supplies. ``The rains were so heavy it damaged the
roofs of some houses ... I cannot understand why there is no water
in my house.''
	   Waterworks are the responsibility of state governments, but
Vellu's office supervises these at the federal level.
	   Nearly one-third of the population of Klang Valley, as Kuala
Lumpur and its suburbs are known, are on water rationing. Residents
wait several times a week with pails, plastic containers, urns and
even bottles for water trucks to arrive.
	   Malaysia's worst drought in decades is being blamed for the
crisis in the city that depends mainly on rain-fed reservoirs. But
some experts also say that indiscriminate logging has affected
traditional rainfall in the area.

Thai baht continues to fall as finance minister plans U.S. trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai baht slid lower in mid-morning
trading Thursday on dollar-buying by foreign funds worried by the
deepening recession of Asian economies.
	   Worry that the regional slump will spark a new crisis in the
Thai economy _ which has yet to recover from last year's financial
shocks _ has caused Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda to
plan a trip to the United States, his office said Thursday.
	   The details of his trip have yet to be confirmed, his office
said, but the Bangkok Post reported Tarrin planned to meet with
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and International Monetary
Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus.
	   The report said that Tarrin would seek assurances of assistance
in case Thailand had to face increased obligations due to currency
fluctuations and an outflow of funds.
	   The IMF coordinated a dlrs 17.2 billion loan package last year
to help Thailand cope with its severe economic crisis.
	   The crisis was sparked when an economic slowdown exposed a
mountain of bad debt in the financial sector. The de facto
devaluation of the baht exacerbated the crisis by making it almost
impossible for Thai companies to pay back dollar and yen
denominated loans.
	   The baht weakened from about 39 to the U.S. dollar last week to
close Wednesday at 42.20, its lowest level in 12 weeks.
	   On Thursday morning it continued to sink to 42.60.
	   ``But the baht has been oversold,'' said a dealer at an European
bank. ``We can expect profit-taking on the dollar if it continues
to rise further.''
	   Thai share prices opened higher Thursday after the central bank
announced details of a debt restructuring plan for the private
sector that will allow commercial banks to set aside smaller
amounts of reserves, dealers said.
	   Fifteen minutes after trading started, the Stock Exchange of
Thailand index was up 1.38 points to 314.59, compared with
Wednesday's close of 313.21.
	   The Thai central bank has relaxed its rules on loan
classification to encourage financial institutions to negotiate
with borrowers to whittle down a mountain of problem loans.
	   Dealers said investors are buying shares selectively, mostly in
shares of finance and banking stocks on the news.
	   ``This is good news, but I don't expect the SET Index to rise
much because it will take some time before we see any tangible
impact (from the new reserve rules),'' said a trader at Adkinson
Securities.

Official banned from financial industry for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ China's financial regulators have banned from
any involvement in stocks or futures trading an official who is
suspected of having taken public funds to trade futures for
himself, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said Thursday.
	   Guo Peijin, formerly the director of a branch office of the
commodity futures exchange of Hainan province, an island off
China's south coast, allegedly took 35 million yuan (dlrs 4.24
million) from the exchange, according to state media reports.
	   The money belonged to exchange members who had deposited it in
Guo's office, in the boomtown of Shenzhen near Hong Kong, to cover
margin requirements for futures trading, the reports said.
	   Officials at the commission said Guo would be banned from
trading for three years.
	   China's futures markets, renowned for their casino-like trading
atmosphere, have often defied government regulatory efforts,
traders say.
	   The government has recently stepped up efforts to curb
irregularities in China's financial markets as part of an industry
restructuring expected later this year. A reliable futures market
is seen as essential for China's transition from state planning to
a market economy.

Singapore cautiously predicts less regional haze this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore weathermen cautiously predicted less
severe haze from regional fires this year, but police announced
measures Thursday that they will take if the optimism proves wrong.
	   In a twice-monthly update, the Meteorological Service said the
current weakening of the El Nino weather pattern ``should help to
prevent the recurrence this year of the prolonged dry weather
condition which contributed significantly'' to last year's regional
haze.
	   El Nino has been partly blamed for 1997's haze, as fires set by
farmers and plantation owners to clear Indonesian jungle raged out
of control amid unusually dry weather. The resulting haze caused
billions of dollars in damage.
	   The report said that the region was mostly free of haze last
month because ``rain has suppressed almost all the major fires in
Borneo,'' and there were only isolated forest fires in central
Sumatra.
	   The U.N. Environment Program said Thursday that 30 fires are not
yet out in Indonesian Borneo, and it would take 30,000 firefighters
to extinguish them.
	   Since substantial rain is not expected until October, the fires
can erupt again and spread, especially if nothing is done to stop
the practice of land-clearing by fire.
	   Reiterating reports from the World Meteorological Organization,
Singapore meteorologist Wong Teo Suan said El Nino is waning.
	   He added that the effect known as La Nina, which reverses El
Nino's weather patterns and would bring more rain to the region by
September or October, could be quite strong this year.
	   But he warned that fires in Indonesia might cause some haze
before that, during the usual dry season that starts in June or
July and lasts until October.
	   Wong pointed out that Indonesian farmers and plantation owners
``will probably take advantage of that dry weather to burn.''
	   Taking no chances, Singapore's police force said it will step up
patrols, and issue officers with face masks, if the haze worsens.
The announcement was aimed at alleviating any fear that police
would stay inside to avoid breathing the haze.
	   A public warning system used for peacetime emergencies will be
activated if the pollution standards index rises to the 400 region,
which is described by the Environment Ministry as hazardous.
Singapore's pollution level rose to an all-time high of 226 last
Sept. 19.

IMF team to visit crisis-hit Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will
send a team to Indonesia next week as the new government grapples
with a spiralling economic crisis, the fund's Jakarta
representative Kadhim Al-Eyd said Thursday.
	   Last week the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific Affairs Hubert
Neiss held meetings with Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie,
Cabinet ministers and opposition figures following the May 21
resignation of former leader, Suharto.
	   Neiss reported on his visit to the IMF's management and
executive board in Washington on Monday.
	   A dlrs 43 billion IMF rescue package for Indonesia has stalled
because of the political turmoil as well as riots and protests that
preceded Suharto's resignation.
	   Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's economic woes. Its
currency has plummeted while inflation and unemployment have
soared.
	   The economy is expected to contract at least 10 percent this
year _ compared with the 5 percent shrinkage predicted by the
government in March.
	   The IMF is currently reviewing when to release a dlrs 1 billion
installment under the package to Indonesia.
	   IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said this week that
IMF funding should resume _ if all goes reasonably well _ soon
after the review team winds up its mission in Jakarta.

Ella predicts test will be a `joke'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former Wallaby captain Mark Ella has
dismissed Saturday's rugby test between Australia and England as
``a joke'' and ``a waste of time.''
	   Ella joined administrators Dick McGruther and John O'Neill in
attacking England's 37-man squad. There are 20 uncapped players on
tour and five of them will play their debut tests Saturday.
	   ``Not only will the match become a joke and a waste of time, but
it will do Australia's preparations for the forthcoming Tri-nations
series against New Zealand and South Africa no good at all,'' Ella
wrote in a monthly magazine column for the Australian Rugby Review.
	   ``Could you imagine the outcry in England if John Eales and half
a dozen of his Wallaby mates decided not to visit Twickenham for
the next Cook Cup game in November.''
	   He said Australia should not have to put up with the weakened
tourists.
	   ``Why should we cop this pathetic treatment when another
international against England in November is the last thing we
need?'' Ella said.
	   The Wallaby players have already expressed disappointment over
the comments from ARU chairman McGruther, who described the touring
party as the greatest English sellout since the Gallipoli, and
chief executive O'Neill who was also critical of the touring side.
	   ``I can see why those comments were made but it really does us
no good,'' said Wallaby coach Rod Macqueen.

<TEXT>
	   In Los Angeles, Eric Karros homered and drove in five runs, and
Ramon Martinez pitched seven strong innings as the Dodgers beat St.
Louis to snap a four-game losing streak.
	   Karros, who had four hits, entered the game without an RBI in
his last 45 at-bats since hitting homering May 19 at Chicago. His
solo homer off Mark Petkovsek (3-2) in the fifth was just his
second of the season.
	   Martinez (7-2), who has won five straight decisions, allowed
five hits and two runs. Scott Radinsky got the final out for his
11th save.
	   Gary Gaetti homered for St. Louis, without slugger Mark McGwire
for the second straight game. McGwire, who leads the majors with 27
home runs, also is expected to sit out Thursday night's finale of
the three-game series due to the lower back spasms he suffered
Monday night in San Diego.

Overnight rain delays start of second day's play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Overnight rain delayed the start of the
second day of play in the second cricket Test between New Zealand
and Sri Lanka Thursday.
	   Following the overnight shower, New Zealand coach Steve Rixon
and manager John Graham inspected the ground and returned to their
hotel.
	   It was not clear when the umpires would review the condition of
the field, which was pocked with large puddles.
	   New Zealand was set to resume at 96 for 4 in their first innings
after captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and elected to bat first
on Wednesday. Rain reduced the first day's play to 55.1 overs.

TORONTO: scoreless innings.
</HEADLINE>
  Angels 8, Mariners 1  

<TEXT>
	   In Seattle, Damon Mashore triggered a five-run inning by hitting
a tiebreaking homer off Randy Johnson in the seventh, and Chuck
Finley pitched eight strong innings for Anaheim.
	   After Mashore's second homer of the season broke a 1-1 tie, the
Angels broke the game open and chased Johnson (5-4).
	   Following Gary DiSarcina's double, Johnson hit Darin Erstad with
a pitch and walked Dave Hollins to load the bases. Tim Salmon's
fielder's choice groundout brought in DiSarcina, and Cecil
Fielder's single scored Erstad to put Anaheim ahead 4-1.
	   Pinch-hitter Garrett Anderson added an RBI single off Mike
Timlin, and Fielder came in from third on center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr.'s throwing error on the play.
	   Anaheim, coming off a brawl-marred victory at Kansas City the
previous night, won its fourth in a row. Seattle lost its third
straight.
  Rangers 16, Athletics 10  
	   In Oakland, California, Juan Gonzalez and Luis Alicea homered in
a six-run fifth inning and the Texas Rangers withstood Rickey
Henderson's grand slam to beat the Oakland Athletics.
	   Lee Stevens had four hits and drove in two runs and Will Clark
added a three-run double for Texas, which shelled rookie Blake
Stein (1-3) for nine runs on nine hits in 4 1-3 innings.
	   Domingo Cedeno also drove in three runs with a pair of hits as
the teams combined for 32 hits, 19 by Texas.
	   Aaron Sele, denied in his bid to become the majors' first
nine-game winner, took a 12-6 lead into the bottom of the fifth,
but gave up three straight singles before Henderson connected for
his third career slam and second this season.

Novus Petroleum says it is buying concessions in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Oil and gas company Novus Petroleum
Ltd. said Thursday it is buying joint venture interests in five
concessions in Egypt for U.S. dlrs 40 million from Samsung Corp.
	   Novus said it intends to fund the purchase through its corporate
debt facilities and by the sale of one or more of its existing
properties.
	   The five properties in the western desert in Egypt include
existing oil and gas production, oil and gas fields under
development, a major gas trunkline under construction which will
connect this area into the Egyptian domestic grid, and exploration
acreage.
	   Samsung has said it was selling its interests to help overcome
the foreign currency crisis being experienced by the corporation,
Novus said in a statement.
	   The effective date of the acquisition is Jan. 1, 1998. An offer
is being considered for the sale of its small interest in the SE
Sumatra PSC in Indonesia, Novus said.
	   Novus managing director Bob Williams said the company sees it as
a good balance for its other business units in Southeast Asia and
Australia.
	   Novus estimates the new Egyptian portfolio contains proven and
probable reserves totaling 22.6 million barrels of oil equivalent
to Novus.

At 46, Duran going for another title
</HEADLINE>
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roberto Duran didn't exactly fight his way to
what might be his last title fight. After more than three decades
in the ring, he didn't have to.
	   To the legend goes the spoils in boxing, in this case a
middleweight title fight Saturday night with WBA champion William
Joppy.
	   ``Hopefully, he'll take advantage of this opportunity,'' said
Elias Cordoba, president of the WBA's world championship committee
and, like Duran, a Panamanian.
	   Twenty-six years after he stopped Ken Buchanan in Madison Square
Garden to win the first of four titles in different weight classes,
Duran returns to a place he has had some of his greatest success.
	   He hasn't fought for a title in nine years, and was knocked down
in the first round of his last fight before rallying to beat
Colombian Felix Hernandez earlier this year in Panama.
	   Hardly credentials for a shot at Joppy, but Duran still has a
name. And promoters hope that will lure some fans Saturday night on
the undercard of the Evander Holyfield-Henry Akinwande heavyweight
title fight.
	   ``You're going to be certain to see a very different Roberto
Duran than you've seen lately,'' Duran said. ``I'm ready for the
fight. You're going to be surprised.''
	   Fighting at the Garden is a homecoming of sorts for Duran, who
made his debut in the United States by knocking out Benny Huertas
in the first round of their 1971 fight.
	   Later, he roamed the streets of Manhattan hoping no one would
recognize him. No one did.
	   ``I made up my mind right then that the next time I fought here
everyone would know my name,'' Duran recalled Wednesday. ``And the
next time they did know who I was.''
	   Duran would return a year later to stop Buchanan and win the
first of four titles in different weight classes. Now he is still
fighting at the age of 46, and running out of chances.
	   Duran hasn't fought for a title since losing his middleweight
crown to Sugar Ray Leonard in a 12-round decision.
	   But while his contemporaries have all long since retired, Duran
keeps on fighting, motivated both by a love of the sport and the
need to erase some long-standing tax debts. Saturday night will
mark the 116th time he has stepped into the ring as a pro. He has
won 102 of those fights.
	   ``Who could imagine he could be fighting on at his age?'' said
Buchanan, now a 52-year-old carpenter in Coatbridge, Scotland.
``But there is an exception to every rule, and I guess Duran is
it.''
	   It was the Buchanan fight on June 26, 1972, that not only made
Duran a name fighter, but gave him the WBA and WBC lightweight
titles.
	   Duran beat and battered the Scottish champion throughout the
fight, finally ending it on a low blow that put Buchanan on his
hands and knees as the 13th round ended. He could not come out for
round 14.
	   ``I was not doing very well at all, which might be because Duran
was having such a good night,'' Buchanan said. ``To go 13 rounds
with that Roberto Duran in Madison Square Garden was a feat. It
seems more a feat as time goes by.''
	   That Roberto Duran, though, is not the Roberto Duran of today, a
portly fighter who has had to struggle to get down to 160 pounds
(72.5 kilograms) to fight Joppy.
	   But Duran has won fights before that he wasn't supposed to win,
and Joppy isn't selling him short.
	   ``He's tricky and I do have to watch out for him,'' Joppy said.
``But if I don't knock him out, I'll beat him badly for 12
rounds.''

Mahathir criticizes West, warns about high interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said on
Thursday that high interest rates hold the risk of increased
bankruptcies for Malaysian companies.
	   In a speech delivered at a symposium here, Mahathir also lashed
out at the International Monetary Fund and Western capitalists for
being insensitive to the people of Asia.
	   Noting that one of the International Monetary Fund's
prescriptions for struggling economies was to tighten monetary
policy, Mahathir said, ``When the interest rate is increased and
credit is pulled back, the task of making additional profit is made
quite impossible.
	   ``Between the currency and share devaluation and the interest
rate increase and credit squeeze, most of the nations' companies
will go bankrupt,'' he said.
	   Asked about the leadership change in Indonesia, Mahathir said
``Mere change in government doesn't mean anything if other things
are not there.''
	   He added that a quick resumption of IMF funding to Indonesia
will be necessary to help Indonesia restore stability.

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ The women lay immobile on hard
beds, their shattered limbs tangled under thin blankets, hair and
faces covered with cotton scarves, intravenous tubes taped to their
wrists.
	   Nearby, little girls heads wrapped in layers of gauze and hands
in little splints sat up in beds looking around the hospital ward
with wide eyes.
	   The overwhelming majority of injured _ and presumably the dead _
in the 6.9 magnitude earthquake that shattered dozens of villages
in northern Afghanistan on Saturday were women and children. While
men were working in the fields or traveling to the market, most of
the women and children in the villages were inside the sun-baked
mud homes.
	   Evacuating the wounded has been the priority of the United
Nations and International Red Cross, aid workers said Thursday. Aid
workers have appealed for more helicopters to reach remote mountain
villages where wounded and hungry victims waited for help.
	   The rain that had stopped aid flights on Wednesday had given way
to sunny skies Thursday. By midmorning aircraft from neighboring
Pakistan and Tajikistan had begun to arrive in Faisabad with food,
blankets and more medical supplies.
	   But needs are desperate.
	   Shamila was eating with her mother and brother when the quake
shook her village of Shari Basurkh, near the epicenter. Her father
reached the house too late to save his wife and son, but he managed
to dig Shamila out of the rubble.
	   They huddled together for three days before a U.N. helicopter
brought them to the hospital in Faisabad, 30 miles (45 kilometers)
away, where doctors are fighting to save the 8-year-old girl from
massive head and stomach injuries.
	   Shamila lay on her bed, her puffy face practically swallowed by
gauze as her father gingerly pushed bits of rice into her mouth,
weeping. He sleeps on the floor, next to her bed.
	   Most of the quake survivors have been brought to Faisabad
hospital where 14 doctors, medics and nurses struggle just to keep
their 80 patients fed.
	   A Norwegian charity has donated high protein biscuits, which
some patients' families can supplement with the little food they
scraped together before the helicopter evacuation.
	   The aid agencies allowed one relative to accompany the injured
to Faisabad, to cushion the shock and help with treatment.
	   Throughout the wards, husbands and sons tended to their women. A
man helped his wife shuffle along, leaning painfully on crutches
and dragging her crushed leg behind her. Others simply sat
alongside their wives and daughters gazing at them as they slept.
	   Doran Boi fretted about the people left behind in his village of
Kol, where not one of some 1,000 homes were left intact. Survivors
were sleeping on the hillside and had not received any food since
the quake hit, he said.
	   To make matters worse, the earthquake coincided with what an
International Red Cross representative called the ``hunger
season'', after winter stocks are practically depleted and before
the spring wheat can be harvested.
	   ``We've been focusing on medical needs up to now,'' said Rupert
Collevile, U.N. spokesman. ``But the critical need now is for
food.''

Official: Soros may seek stake in Philippine National Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ International financier George Soros
may be considering acquiring the government's 45.5 percent stake in
Philippine National Bank, according to Finance Secretary Salvador
Enriquez.
	   Enriquez said he had been approached by a member of Soros' staff
on a recent trip to the United States who inquired about a ``due
diligence'' study of PNB.
	   The administration of incoming president Joseph Estrada is eager
to sell the government's stake in PNB. The bank, one of the
country's biggest, was partially privatized two years ago.
	   Talk of Soros possibly taking the government's stake in PNB
lifted sentiment Thursday in Philippine stocks, which had been
falling for over a week.
	   ``It sent a positive signal to the market,'' said Peter Unlay,
analyst for Tower Securities Inc.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 24.89 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 1,953.88.
	   PNB shares, meanwhile closed 2 pesos higher at 71 pesos.
	   The sale of the government's stake in PNB is among a number of
state holdings earmarked to go under the hammer that also include
utility National Power Corp.
	   Estrada has pledged to continue outgoing President Fidel Ramos'
privatization drive to hand over often inefficiently run state
enterprises to the private sector and compensate for reduced tax
revenues.
	   According to some estimates, the government's PNB stake could be
worth 6 billion pesos (dlrs 154 million).
	   Incoming finance secretary Edgardo Espiritu, who will help
complete PNB's sale, is a former chairman of the bank and helped
structure its partial privatization.
	   Bank analysts fear that PNB has been particularly hard hit by
bad loans resulting from the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``As the financial crisis swept across the country, firms
seeking debt protection and filing for bankruptcy seemed to
continually cite PNB among creditors,'' Indosuez W.I. Carr
Securities noted in a recent report on Philippine banks.
	   The report also voiced concern over the bank's strong growth in
loans last year and its exposure to property developers, which it
said was ``disturbingly high.''
	   W.I. Carr Indosuez forecasts PNB's net profit in 1998 declining
to 879 million pesos (dlrs 22.5 million) from 1.1 billion pesos
(dlrs 28.2 million) in 1997.

Germany vows to go ahead with Holocaust monument
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government will build a monument
to the European Jews murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust,
although American sculptor Richard Serra has pulled out of the
project, media reported Thursday.
	   Government spokesman Otto Hauser said Wednesday that Serra, who
along with the New York-based architect Peter Eisenman submitted
the design for the monument, wrote to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
that he was quitting for ``personal and professional reasons.''
	   ``He said that his decision has nothing to do with the project
itself or his relationship to Kohl or the German government,''
Hauser said of Serra.
	   ``The German government remains of the opinion that the monument
for the murdered Jews of Europe should be built on the piece of
land allocated for it in Berlin,'' Hauser said.
	   Serra and Eisenman's design was selected by the German
government after a design chosen by a committee in 1996 was
rejected.

Oil slick threatens marien life off Pakistan, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The first traces of an oil slick from a
damaged tanker have reached Pakistan's southern shore, threatening
marine life and beaches, officials said Thursday.
	   The maritime and environmental officials estimated that nearly
all 5,000 tons of oil had leaked from the Belize-registered ship
Yashika, which was abandoned after it sustained damage Tuesday on
its way from Bahrain to Bombay, India, about 190 miles (305
kilometers) southeast of Karachi.
	   The ship's crew was rescued by an Indian vessel Aditya Kiren,
said the officials on condition of anonymity.
	   The oil was threatening a 300-kilometer (180-mile) stretch of
coastline east of Karachi, where the space research facility at
Sonmiani and the port of Pasni are located.
	   ``At the rate the oil slick is spreading in the sea, it will be
three or four days before it reaches Sonmiani and destroys the
natural ecosystem there,'' said Parvez Naim, of the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature.
	   Much of the shore is industrialized, but the sea off the coast
is rich with dolphins, turtles and shrimp. A thick layer of oil
would block sunlight to the marine life, and threaten mangroves,
the union said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The former head of Russia's beleaguered Federal
Tax Service has been named to a new government post as chief of
finance and credit regulation, news agencies said Thursday.
	   Alexander Pochinok, fired as head of the tax service last week,
will be in charge of analyzing and forecasting government economic
policy, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies said.
	   ITAR-Tass quoted Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko
praising Pochinok as a ``high-level expert in his field.''
	   Pochinok was replaced at the tax service on May 29 by former
Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov.
	   His firing came amid Russia's financial crisis and intense
international criticism over the government's perennially low tax
collections.

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ The women lay immobile on hard
beds, their shattered limbs tangled under thin blankets, hair and
faces covered with cotton scarves, intravenous tubes taped to their
wrists.
	   Nearby, little girls heads wrapped in layers of gauze and hands
in little splints sat up in beds looking around the hospital ward
with wide eyes.
	   The overwhelming majority of injured _ and presumably the dead _
in the 6.9 magnitude earthquake that shattered dozens of villages
in northern Afghanistan on Saturday were women and children. While
men were working in the fields or traveling to the market, most of
the women and children in the villages were inside the sun-baked
mud homes.
	   On Wednesday, a strong aftershock severely damaged four villages
near Shari Basurkh, near the epicenter of Saturday's quake, ``which
just proves that people were right to be afraid of sleeping in
their homes,'' said Sarah Russel, a U.N. spokeswoman in Islamabad,
Pakistan.
	   Evacuating the wounded has been the priority of the United
Nations and International Red Cross, aid workers said Thursday. Aid
workers have appealed for more helicopters to reach remote mountain
villages where wounded and hungry victims waited for help.
	   The rain that had stopped aid flights on Wednesday had given way
to sunny skies Thursday. By midmorning aircraft from neighboring
Pakistan and Tajikistan had begun to arrive in Faisabad with food,
blankets and more medical supplies.
	   The U.S. State Department confirmed it was sending two large
helicopters each with a 20-ton capacity, and aid officials were
negotiating with commercial companies in Afghanistan's neighborhood
for more aircraft.
	   But needs are desperate.
	   Shamila was eating with her mother and brother when the quake
shook her village of Shari Basurkh. Her father reached the house
too late to save his wife and son, but he managed to dig Shamila
out of the rubble.
	   They huddled together for three days before a U.N. helicopter
brought them to the hospital in Faisabad, 30 miles (45 kilometers)
away, where doctors are fighting to save the 8-year-old girl from
massive head and stomach injuries.
	   Shamila lay on her bed, her puffy face practically swallowed by
gauze as her father gingerly pushed bits of rice into her mouth,
weeping. He sleeps on the floor, next to her bed.
	   Most of the quake survivors have been brought to Faisabad
hospital where 14 doctors, medics and nurses struggle just to keep
their 80 patients fed.
	   A Norwegian charity has donated high protein biscuits, which
some patients' families can supplement with the little food they
scraped together before the helicopter evacuation.
	   The aid agencies allowed one relative to accompany the injured
to Faisabad, to cushion the shock and help with treatment.
	   Throughout the wards, husbands and sons tended to their women. A
man helped his wife shuffle along, leaning painfully on crutches
and dragging her crushed leg behind her. Others simply sat
alongside their wives and daughters gazing at them as they slept.
	   Doran Boi fretted about the people left behind in his village of
Kol, where not one of some 1,000 homes were left intact. Survivors
were sleeping on the hillside and had not received any food since
the quake hit, he said.
	   To make matters worse, the earthquake coincided with what an
International Red Cross representative called the ``hunger
season'', after winter stocks are practically depleted and before
the spring wheat can be harvested.
	   ``We've been focusing on medical needs up to now,'' said Rupert
Collevile, U.N. spokesman. ``But the critical need now is for
food.''

Dollar edged higher, stocks finish higher

  Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen
Thursday, despite some profit-taking ahead of next week's meeting
of officials from the Group of Seven nations. Tokyo stocks finished
higher.
	   The dollar bought 138.14 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.38
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level
of 138.75 yen overnight.
	   Traders said there remains no change in the overall
dollar-buying trend against the yen. Japanese institutional
investors bought the dollar when it hit 138 yen, keeping the
currency from falling below that, traders said.
	   The dollar's relative weakness from late Wednesday's levels in
New York came after as hedge funds and other U.S. players took
profits amid concern about next Tuesday's meeting in Paris of
deputy finance ministers from G-7 industrialized nations.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stocks advanced on futures-driven
buying and bargain-hunting by public funds. Because of little fresh
market-moving news, many investors retreated to the sidelines.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 79.47 points,
or 0.52 percent, closing at 15,426.47 points. On Wednesday, the
index lost 207.45 points, or 1.33 percent.
	   Share prices moved into positive territory following a rise in
futures prices at midday Thursday, causing investors to think that
public pension funds would be among buyers.
	   Buying from foreign investors also supported the market, traders
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,207.50. The
TOPIX lost 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond edged down to 1.130 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.150
percent, driving its price up to 112.58 yen from 112.43 yen.

cloud-covered mountain Thursday in the disputed territory of East
Timor, killing two top commanders and nine other officers and
soldiers. One man survived.
	   The U.S.-made Bell 205 helicopter exploded on impact, military
Lt. Col. Supardi said in a telephone interview from Dili, capital
of the former Portuguese colony. It was raining at the time, and
visibility was poor.
	   ``It was a pure accident,'' Supardi said.
	   Separatist rebels who have been fighting the military for two
decades sometimes clash with soldiers in the area, but there was no
indication that they had shot down the helicopter.
	   The victims included Maj. Gen. Yudomo, who was appointed last
month as military commander for eastern Indonesia, including East
Timor, and Col. Slamet Sidabutar, commander in the territory.
	   Yudomo, who was based in the resort island of Bali, and the
other officers were on an inspection tour when the helicopter
crashed.
	   Army Capt. Muhamad, the military spokesman in Dili, survived
with serious injuries. The helicopter shattered into pieces on
impact, leaving only the tail intact.
	   Hampered by rugged terrain, rescue workers evacuated burned
bodies from the remote site near Viqueque, about 110 miles (180
kilometers) east of Dili. The helicopter went down four minutes
after taking off from the nearby town of Baucau.
	   The city is 1,200 miles (1,920 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   The Indonesian military invaded East Timor in 1975, and has
maintained a heavy presence there ever since. Indonesia declared
the territory its 27th province in 1976, but a small band of
guerrillas who want independence continue to fight.
	   In the Indonesian military's worst air crash, an air force C-130
transport plane crashed minutes after taking off from Halim
military base in Jakarta in October 1991, killing 136 soldiers
aboard. One man survived. The cause remains unknown.
	   In March last year, an Indonesian air force F-16 jet crashed in
bad weather in Jakarta, killing the pilot.

Creditors file bankruptcy claims against Thai computer firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A computer firm once billed as the
cornerstone of a new, high-tech Thailand took a step closer
Thursday to becoming the first major test case of new Thai
bankruptcy laws.
	   Alphatec Electronics PCL said a bankruptcy judge had accepted a
petition from six creditor banks to reorganize the company under
the country's revised, creditor-friendly bankruptcy laws.
	   The computer-chip company said in a statement to the Stock
Exchange of Thailand that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing
to appoint a planner to oversee the reorganization. The creditors
have sought the appointment of accounting giant Price Waterhouse.
	   Because of the proceedings, Alphatec asked the exchange to
rescind a directive requiring the company to appoint a financial
planner by Thursday or face delisting.
	   The company's stock has been suspended since July 25, 1997.
	   Alphatec was once the vanguard of Thailand's efforts to become a
high-tech manufacturing center. But Price Waterhouse concluded in
an independent audit last year that the company had been falsifying
financial statements for years.
	   Charn Uswachoke, the founder and chief executive, resigned after
the report was published. In March the company told the stock
exchange it was ``clearly insolvent.''
	   The company owes about dlrs 330 million to its creditors.
	   On May 12, a group of six creditors petitioned the court to
reorganize Alphatec under laws passed this year that for the first
time allow reorganization as an alternative to liquidation.
	   The new bankruptcy laws are seen as vital for the country to
emerge from the corporate devastation of the economic crisis that
has battered the Thai economy for nearly a year.
	   The creditors are Bangkok Bank PCL, Credit Agricole Indosuez,
ING Bank, Nakornthon Bank PCL, Standard Chartered Bank, and
Sumitomo Bank.

Middle East preoccupies ministers on first day of conference
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY ULBRICH  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) - The Israelis don't think the Europeans
have any business talking about the Middle East peace process at
the Euro-Mediterranean conference here. But they did. The
Palestinians think the Europeans must talk about the stalled peace
talks and issue a tough statement. They didn't.
	   Foreign Ministers from the 15 EU nations and 12 of their
Mediterranean partners began their two-day meeting meeting here
Wednesday under the shadow of Middle East talks that seem to be
going nowhere and an explosive situation in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo that could be headed toward a Balkan war.
	   ``We are all conscious that the political background of our work
here is the present deadlock in the Middle East peace process,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the opening session of
the Euro-Mediterranean conference, which was supposed to focus on
developing a regional free-trade and security zone by the year
2010.
	   The Israelis, who took a bashing from the Europeans at this
conference a year ago in Malta, say the Euro-Med process begun in
Barcelona in 1995 should be talking about economics and terrorism,
not meddling in matters better handled by Israel, the United States
and the Palestinians alone.
	   Farouk Kaddoumi, foreign affairs chief for the Palestine
Liberation Organization, said this conference should stand up in
support of the peace talks and name the names of those blocking
progress - Israel, in their view.
	   The percentage of territory in the West Bank that Israel should
surrender to Palestinian control is not the real issue, he said.
``It's the idea of whether they want to redeploy their forces or
not. It's not the percentage.''
	   Cook chose the middle road, saying the Euro-Mediterranean
process can contribute to a proper atmosphere for progress in the
Middle East.
	   Many of the ministers also had Kosovo on their minds following a
renewed series of attacks in the province and a wave of refugees
moving across the border into Albania.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said ``There have to be
stronger measures against (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic.''
	   If the escalation of violence continues, he said, ``then there
has to be a cutoff of investments and the freezing of Yugoslav
money abroad has to be enforced.''
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said NATO is now studying
what he called a ``shield'' on the borders between Kosovo, Albania
and Macedonia.
	   ``These repressive acts have to be stopped immediately,'' he
said, referring to Serb authorities, who have moved against ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the province's population.
``That will be a condition for a fruitful dialogue.''

Germany vows to go ahead with Holocaust monument
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CLARIFIES design won't change in graf 4.  

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government will build a monument
to the European Jews murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust,
although American sculptor Richard Serra has pulled out of the
project, media reported Thursday.
	   Government spokesman Otto Hauser said Wednesday that Serra, who
along with the New York-based architect Peter Eisenman submitted
the design for the monument, wrote to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
that he was quitting for ``personal and professional reasons.''
	   ``He said that his decision has nothing to do with the project
itself or his relationship to Kohl or the German government,''
Hauser said of Serra.
	   Serra said the design would remain unchanged, and he hoped to
see it realized as he and Eisenman had planned.
	   ``The German government remains of the opinion that the monument
for the murdered Jews of Europe should be built on the piece of
land allocated for it in Berlin,'' Hauser said.
	   Serra and Eisenman's design was selected by the German
government after a design chosen by a committee in 1996 was
rejected.

Kremlin spokesman hints again at third Yeltsin run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Probing public reaction, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said on a late night television program Wednesday that
the president may seek a third term in 2000.
	   While Yeltsin himself has repeatedly said he intends to step
down after his current term ends, spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky
and other Kremlin spin doctors have long been hinting that the
67-year-old leader may run again.
	   The issue of Yeltsin's participation in the election ``remains
open,'' Yastrzhembsky said on the Vremechko late night talk show on
Russia's TV-Center channel.
	   Yeltsin's statements on the issue ``make it evident that he has
not made a final decision'' on whether to take part in the next
presidential race, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   However, Yeltsin's own remarks have been consistently against a
run. For example, he said in March that he would be ``dropping out
of the elections.''
	   The conflicting statements appear aimed at testing voters'
response, which has so far been mixed. Many say the constitution's
limit on two terms and the president's questionable health should
rule out another run.
	   Yastrzhembsky tackled both arguments, insisting that Yeltsin is
fit and ``very active'' and reiterating the Kremlin claim that the
president's first term doesn't count since it began back in the
Soviet times.
	   Russia's constitutional court is expected to rule on the issue
later this year. Earlier this week, Yeltsin met with the court's
chairman Marat Baglai, but the Kremlin kept mum on whether they
discussed the subject.
	   Other potential candidates include former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, and former national security chief Alexander
Lebed.

Hezbollah leader says deal close on Israel-Hezbollah swap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - The leader of Hezbollah guerrillas says a
deal has nearly been completed with Israel for the release of
Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the return of body parts of
Israeli soldiers.
	   ``Negotiations are now taking place on some details,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah said in a Wednesday night television interview.
	   ``If we work out these details, a prisoner exchange deal can be
concluded,'' he said in the interview with the private station Murr
Television. Excerpts from the interview were carried in Thursday's
newspapers.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has been
negotiating between Israel and Lebanon for months on a possible
swap and both sides have said they are willing to make a deal.
	   Hezbollah has held out on the exchange, insisting that Israel
increase the number of prisoners it intends to free.
	   Nasrallah said in the interview that Hezbollah ``is very keen''
to secure the release of the largest possible number of prisoners,
adding that Israel had upped an earlier offer.
	   ``They've increased the number,'' he said. ``Agreement has been
reached on (the release) of more than 30 prisoners,'' he said.
	   He refused to give the exact number of prisoners to be freed by
Israel under the deal still being negotiated.
	   The leader of the Shiite Muslim militant guerrillas fighting to
oust Israeli forces from an occupied zone in southern Lebanon also
said that Hezbollah was giving priority for live prisoners as well
as the old and sick among them.
	   Israel holds about 210 Lebanese captured in southern Lebanon, 60
of them held in Israel and the rest in the Khiam detention camp in
the occupied zone in the south, Nasrallah said.
	   The prisoners are mostly held on suspicion of being guerrillas
or aiding in attacks against Israeli forces. Those in Khiam are
held without trial. Some of the rest are detained in Israel as a
bargaining chip for future exchanges with the guerrillas.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas hold body parts of more than one Israeli
soldier left behind after botched operation in southern Lebanon
Sept. 5 in which a total of 12 Israeli commandos were killed.
	   Nasrallah said the exchange will not include prime prisoners
held by Israel. They are: Hezbollah commander Sheik Abdel-Karim
Obeid, who was kidnapped by Israeli commandos in 1989; Mustafa
Dirani, head of a militant Shiite group who was seized from his
home in eastern Lebanon in 1994; and Soha Bishara, a Communist who
shot and wounded the commander of Israeli-backed militiamen in the
south in 1988.
	   In a deal brokered by Germany in 1996, Israel freed 45
guerrillas and returned to Lebanon the bodies of 123 fighters in
exchange for the remains of two Israeli soldiers who died after
being captured by Hezbollah guerrillas 10 years earlier.

Malaysia invites foreign investors in machinery-building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's trade minister on
Thursday invited foreign investment in the nation's machinery and
equipment-making industry, promising to keep its open policy toward
outside business partners.
	   Demands for machinery was expected to increase as
industrialization deepens, International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said in a speech at the inaugural of an
industry exhibition.
	   Her comments were in sharp contrast to the tenor of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's speech at an international conference
in Tokyo.
	   Mahathir warned Asian nations of the impending dangers of
opening up markets, saying it could lead to governments losing
control of national economies.
	   Since 1993, 473 projects for machinery manufacturing and the
fabrication of metal products worth 6.173 billion ringgit (dlrs
1.58 billion) were cleared. Of these, nearly 58 percent was foreign
investment, Rafidah said.
	   Despite the currency and stock market crisis, Malaysia hopes its
economy will grow by 2.5 percent this year. Last week, the central
bank said that the economy had contracted by 1.8 percent in the
first three months of 1998.

  Hezbollah attack in south Lebanon wounds Israeli soldier

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas detonated a bomb as an
Israeli patrol drove on a road in an occupied zone of southern
Lebanon early Thursday, wounding a soldier, officials said.
	   Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the pre-dawn roadside bomb took place near the
village of Haddatha on the edge of the occupied area which Israel
calls a ``security zone.''
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said a soldier was
moderately wounded when a roadside bomb was set off against an
Israeli force operating in armored vehicles.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said guerrillas detected
Israeli troop movements near Haddatha at 2 a.m. (2300GMT Wednesday)
and attacked with ``appropriate weapons,'' scoring ``direct hits.''
	   Haddatha is on the northern edge of the occupied enclave, about
10 kilometers (six miles) north of Israel's northern border and 22
kilometers (15 miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre.
	   In another attack Thursday morning, Hezbollah guerrillas said
they fired rockets and machine guns at an Israeli outpost at Sojod,
some 35 kilometers (21 miles) northeast of Tyre, destroying
fortifications.
	   There was no comment from the Lebanese security officials and
from Israel on the latest attack.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war against
the 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militias in the
``security zone,'' which makes up 10 percent of Lebanon's
territory.
	   Israel or its allies have controlled the border zone since 1978.
In 1985, the Israeli government established the zone in its present
form with the aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla attacks on
its northern towns.

Taiwanese man arrested for aiding illegal Chinese immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police said Thursday they had arrested a
man suspected of providing Taiwanese passports to Chinese
``snakehead'' gang members who smuggle immigrants to the United
States and Canada.
	   The Criminal Investigation Bureau alleged Peng Yu-ming stole
identification cards from Taiwanese, made copies with photos of the
Chinese clients, and then used them to apply for passports and
visas.
	   Chinese often are denied visas by Western countries, and many
pay more than U.S. dlrs 20,000 for an illegally obtained Taiwanese
passport, police said.
	   Bureau official Tu Mo-lin said the fake identification cards
were partially produced in Hong Kong and Macau because gangs there
have better counterfeiting skills.
	   Taiwan police have contacted Hong Kong and Macau police to
search for Peng's accomplices, Tu said.
	   The ``snakeheads'' used to make fake passports, but turned to
making identification cards after Taiwan introduced
machine-readable passports that are more difficult to counterfeit,
Tu said.
	   He said Chinese wishing to emigrate also were offered an
alternative to pay following their arrival in the West. Chinese
gangs there would find jobs and then take their salary money to pay
off their passage, Tu said.

Grenade blast injures six in Istanbul cafe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded in an Istanbul
cafe overnight, injuring six customers, the Anatolia news agency
reported Thursday.
	   The hand grenade was thrown into a local cafe of Istanbul's
western Kucukcekmece neighborhood just before midnight, the report
said.
	   Some 10 minutes later, after the cafe had been evacuated, a
second hand grenade exploded in the street. No one was injured in
that explosion.
	   The injured were taken to the hospital, and television reports
said one man was in a critical condition after losing both legs in
the blast.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Kurdish
rebels, leftist urban guerrillas and radical Islamic groups are
known to be active in the city.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike by Air France pilots entered its fourth
day Thursday, with some encouraging words from the leading pilots'
union but more transport chaos casting a dark cloud on the World
Cup soccer tournament.
	   A second round of talks at Air France on Wednesday ended with no
agreement, though a spokesman for the leading union SNPL said
Thursday morning that things looked ``more optimistic than the day
before yesterday.''
	   ``It's a little bit premature'' to say the end is near,
spokesman Christian Paris told RTL radio, but he predicted
``significant advances'' in a new round of talks at 6:30 p.m. (1630
GMT).
	   But France's labor troubles continued to widen Thursday, six
days from the World Cup.
	   One Paris subway workers' union staged a partial strike, rail
workers were striking in the Provence-Riviera region until Friday,
and the Communist-led CGT union organized protest marches in Paris.
	   Passengers lucky enough to get a flight and arrive in Paris on
Wednesday had to carry their own luggage when baggage handlers
stayed off the job for the second day of their walkout.
	   Other pay disputes threatened to paralyze trains this weekend,
and airline mechanics chimed in with plans for their own walkout.
	   The transport chaos has unsettled and embarrassed French
politicians and World Cup officials, who now fear one of the
world's biggest sporting events may fizzle into a fiasco instead of
a French triumph.
	   Commenting for the first time on the strike, President Jacques
Chirac on Wednesday night called on both sides to ``show proof of
their responsibility'' in the dispute as France prepares to become
``the host country of the planet.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement on Wednesday
criticized the pilots and said he felt ``sadness, almost shame.''
	   Jacques Lambert, director of the World Cup organizing committee,
said the transport mess could deal a ``serious setback for all the
work we've been doing for five years to stage the tournament as
well as possible.''
	   But CGT chief Louis Viannet said the World Cup didn't mean
unions would call a truce.
	   ``The World Cup is one thing, but the fact it exists doesn't do
away with the problems. Don't be surprised that if the problems
remain'' labor protests continue, he told Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Air France said its Thursday schedule included only 17 percent
of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of its short and
medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40
percent from Orly.
	   The company wants to give its 3,200 pilots stock in exchange for
500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts and has offered to
eventually eliminate a two-tier salary schedule.
	   The carrier, which reported a profit in the last two years,
could lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per day during
the strike.
	   Lambert, the World Cup official, said Air France would guarantee
travel throughout the tournament for all participating teams.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ The women lay immobile on hard
beds, their shattered limbs tangled under thin blankets, hair and
faces covered with cotton scarves, intravenous tubes taped to their
wrists.
	   Nearby, little girls heads wrapped in layers of gauze and hands
in little splints sat up in beds looking around the hospital ward
with wide eyes.
	   The overwhelming majority of injured _ and presumably the dead _
in the 6.9 magnitude earthquake that shattered dozens of villages
in northern Afghanistan on Saturday were women and children. While
men were working in the fields or traveling to the market, most of
the women and children in the villages were inside the sun-baked
mud homes.
	   Evacuating the injured has been the priority of the United
Nations and International Red Cross, aid workers said Thursday. Aid
workers have appealed for more helicopters to reach remote mountain
villages where injured and hungry victims waited for help.

Hezbollah leader says deal close on Israel-Hezbollah swap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - The leader of Hezbollah guerrillas says a
deal has nearly been completed with Israel for the release of
Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the return of body parts of
Israeli soldiers.
	   ``Negotiations are now taking place on some details,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah said in a Wednesday night television interview.
	   ``If we work out these details, a prisoner exchange deal can be
concluded,'' he said in the interview with the private station Murr
Television. Excerpts from the interview were carried in Thursday's
newspapers.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has been
negotiating with Israel and Lebanon for months on a possible swap
and both sides have said they are willing to make a deal.
	   Nasrallah is the leader of the Shiite Muslim militant guerrillas
fighting to oust Israeli forces from an occupied zone in southern
Lebanon
	   He refused to give the exact number of prisoners to be freed by
Israel under the deal still being negotiated.
	   Israel holds about 210 Lebanese captured in southern Lebanon.
The prisoners are mostly held on suspicion of being guerrillas or
aiding in attacks against Israeli forces.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas hold body parts of more than one Israeli
soldier left behind after botched operation in southern Lebanon
Sept. 5 in which a total of 12 Israeli commandos were killed.

U.N. Environment Program: `It's War' against Indonesian fires
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURINDA KEYS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It will take wartime resources to put out the
remaining Indonesian forest fires, and there is a good chance of
new fires and more haze over Southeast Asia, a senior U.N. official
said Thursday.
	   ``It is not merely firefighting anymore. It is a war against the
fires,'' said Jorge Illueca, assistant executive director of the
U.N. Environment Program.
	   The problem ``requires large-scale wartime mobilization of
resources such as personnel, equipment, logistics and
telecommunications,'' Illueca told the Singapore Environment
Council.
	   Although the end of the El Nino weather pattern should ease the
14-month drought, the normal dry season expected to last until
October is sufficient to produce new, widespread fires, and
resulting haze, he said.
	   It is in the dry season that local farmers and large plantation
or timber companies clear land by setting vegetation on fire. These
practices are chiefly blamed for the burning of 2 million hectares
(4.9 million acres) of rain forest, timber and grassland from July
1997 to this April.
	   The return of the same atmospheric patterns that enveloped
cities in the region with smoke and ash last year can be expected
again, Illueco said. If there are huge, uncontrolled fires, the
wind patterns and inversion layers will be the same, and the health
effects will compound respiratory and other ailments suffered last
year.
	   Most of the major fires in East Kalimantan, the Indonesian
portion of Borneo Island, have been subdued, the Singapore
Meteorological Service reported Thursday, based on satellite
photographs.
	   But Illueco said 30 fires are still burning out of control in
inaccessible areas where the drought has depleted the water that
the mostly ill-trained firefighters need. Efforts are aimed at
limiting the blazes with firebreaks.
	   Also, he and other international environmentalists have noted
that the underground peat moss fires, which can spread rapidly and
are the hardest to extinguish, are difficult to detect by
satellite.
	   The United States, Canada and Australia have volunteered to send
firefighting equipment and disaster managers when another major
conflagration erupts this year, Illueco said. But he noted that the
political turmoil in Indonesia has caused many potential donors of
money, manpower and equipment to hold back.
	   ``The immediate future is bleak unless assistance is provided or
sufficient rain falls to stop the fires,'' Illueco said.
	   Although some rain has come, it is unlikely to be extensive,
long lasting or heavy enough to completely extinguish even the
current blazes, much less new fires that normally erupt during the
dry season.
	   ``The rains will eventually come,'' Illueco said. ``The fires
will go out. But not before there is irreparable loss of
biodiversity and valuable resources are destroyed.''

Dissidents, disgraced reformer watched on Tiananmen anniversary

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents and a disgraced Communist Party
reformer drew intensified police scrutiny as plainclothes officers
closely watched Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Thursday, the ninth
anniversary of the armed quelling of massive democracy protests.
	   Police quickly pounced on two men, one in a wheelchair, who
threw leaflets in the air near the obelisk Monument to the People's
Heroes at the heart of the vast square.
	   Although their protest seemingly had no connection to the
anniversary _ the leaflets demanded compensation for a crippling
shooting in southeastern Fujian province _ the police reaction
shows how sensitive the bloody end to the popular protest movement
remains nine years on.
	   A group of five young men who as college students participated
in the 1989 protests said they had come to the square every year
since to commemorate the killings.
	   ``Look at how I'm dressed,'' said one, pointing to his entirely
white attire. White is the traditional color of mourning in China.
	   About two dozen dissidents have been rounded up nationwide to
prevent commemorations of the protests and the military assault
that ended them on June 4, 1989. Hundreds if not thousands were
killed in Beijing and thousands more arrested in the ensuing
crackdown.
	   Chinese leaders have feared ever since that the anniversary will
be used to rally opposition to their rule. A summit between the
Chinese and U.S. presidents in late June and fears of unrest among
millions of laid-off state industrial workers have added to their
usual concerns.
	   The former student protesters kept their memorial discreet,
standing quietly in the square without attracting police attention.
But they had strong opinions about President Clinton's agreement to
receive China's official welcome in Tiananmen.
	   ``We won't welcome President Clinton to China. He's got his
human rights and economic policies mixed up,'' said the young man
dressed in white.
	   The leadership has tightened the house arrest of former party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, seen as a worrisome reminder of the
1989 protests, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Thursday.
	   Zhao's occasional morning walks and visits to friends may not be
done without permission of the party Central Committee, the group
said.
	   Zhao engineered some of China's most crucial economic reforms
and presided over a period of political openness that inspired the
student-led demonstrations. Removed by party elders for resisting
the crackdown, Zhao still inspires dissidents and reform-minded
party officials.
	   Human rights campaigner Lin Xinshu complained Thursday two
plainclothes police officers have been stationed outside his door
for at least two days to watch his movements.
	   Police and soldiers maintained an obvious presence in Tiananmen
Square. Soldiers drilled with Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles
near the Great Hall of the People off the square's western fringe.
Plainclothes police held two-way radios as they patrolled.
	   While Beijing's universities, which were in the forefront of the
1989 protests, have been quiet, fears persist that students may
once again take up the cause of democracy. Professors and think
tank researchers have recently begun pushing for political reform
in a volume not heard since 1989.
	   An article in the state-run China Daily, ostensibly about
Beijing University in the aftermath of its centennial celebrations
last month, however, sent a clear political message.
	   ``We don't need any campaigns, just practical work,'' university
party chief Ren Yanshan was quoted as saying.

VW buys British engine company, moving closer to Rolls-Royce deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG moved a step closer to buying
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., agreeing Thursday also to purchase a
high-performance engine company from the parent of Rolls-Royce.
	   Vickers PLC has agreed to sell Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen for 430
million pounds (dlrs 700 million) and hopes to get final approval
from shareholders on Friday. Just before that crucial meeting,
Vickers said early Thursday that Volkswagen will buy its Cosworth
engine company for 120 million pounds (dlrs 196 million) as part of
the Rolls-Royce deal.
	   Cosworth makes some of the engines for Rolls-Royce, but the
acquisition would only be a partial solution if Volkswagen's rival,
German carmaker BMW, makes good on a threat to cut off supplying
engines for Rolls-Royce after any sale of the company to VW.
	   BMW had agreed earlier to purchase Rolls-Royce for 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) and says it won't change the offer, which
shareholders also must consider.
	   Cosworth also makes engines for the luxury carmaker Jaguar,
owned by the Ford Motor Co.
	   A Vickers spokesman, Neil Hayes, sought to downplay the
significance of BMW's threat although he acknowledged that the
Cosworth engines would be only a ``resource'' rather than a full
solution if the BMW engines are taken away.
	   ``On that front, it's been a noise we've heard, but Volkswagen
are alert to it,'' Hayes said.

Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia by economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
  By JIRAPORN WONGPAITHOON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Southeast Asia's economic crisis has
left five Thai elephants stranded in Indonesia and their trainers
unpaid, the Thai foreign ministry has announced.
	   One of six elephants dispatched to the Indonesian island of
Sumatra late last year on a training mission died, and the head of
an animal conservation group who warned against sending them
expressed anger Thursday that her advice had been disregarded.
	   ``I opposed sending them out of country, I said we can't send
them unless we have a good way to protect and feed them and pay
their mahouts (trainers),'' said Soraida Salwala, founder of the
private Friends of the Asian Elephant foundation.
	   ``We should take these elephants back home,'' she said, adding
that it should be the responsibility of Thailand's Royal Forestry
Department, which approved their mission in the first place.
	   The elephants were sent at the request of Indonesia's forestry
department to help train native pachyderms to round up their
brethren in the wild, who cause widespread damage to crops and
occasionally kill or injure villagers.
	   Soraida and some other wildlife and tourism experts had
expressed suspicion that the request for help was a ploy to steal
Thai elephant training know-how to use for animal shows to draw
tourists.
	   Thai elephants have been called the best trained in the world,
and they show off their skills annually to visitors from around the
world at a well-attended elephant roundup in the northeast.
	   More than 15 years ago, Thailand lent Indonesia four trained
elephants to help ``civilize'' rampaging jumbos that terrorize
communities on Sumatra, but they were never returned, the Bangkok
Post reported last year.
	   The Thai foreign ministry announced Wednesday said it had
ordered the its embassy in Jakarta to pursue the back pay claims of
the mahouts, who have already returned to Thailand.
	   It said the Indonesia forestry department could not pay them
because of the economic crisis that has hit most of East Asia,
especially Indonesia and Thailand.
	   The announcement gave no details of how much the mahouts were
owed or what caused the death of one of the elephants.
	   It said that there were no funds available to ship the elephants
home to Thailand, so they would be taken care of by Indonesia.
	   Even native Indonesian elephants have been suffering from the
economic crisis, the Indonesian news agency Antara reported in
February.
	   Forty-nine elephants at a training center on Sumatra were being
exposed to infection because their handlers couldn't afford to buy
them medicine, the price of which had tripled since the value of
the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, began a steep plunge last
year.

Sculptor under investigation in embezzlement case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Sculptor Cesar Baldaccini, known as Cesar,
has been placed under formal investigation for selling an
overpriced work to a realtor whose company later went bankrupt, a
judicial source said Thursday.
	   The investigation _ one step short of being charged _ is to
determine if Cesar should be charged with receiving embezzled
funds. During the probe, he was ordered to report regularly to
authorities, the source said on condition of anonymity.
	   Known for his crushed car sculptures, Cesar was paid 3.5 million
francs (dlrs 580,000) in the late 1980s by the realtor for his
``Man of the Future,'' the silhouette of a man on rollerskates.
	   The sculpture was valued on the market at 2.5 million francs
(dlrs 416,000).
	   Realtor Henry Pochon, a friend of Cesar, ordered it for a lavish
building near City Hall, overpaying to hide two other works he
wanted for his personal use _ a painting and a crushed sculpture by
the artist, the judicial source said.
	   Pochon's SLYCI realty company later went belly-up, and the ``Man
of the Future,'' known by Lyon residents as ``The rollerskater of
the Opera'' because of its proximity to the city's opera house, is
up for sale.
	   Cesar, 77, could not immediately be reached for comment. His
Paris telephone number was unlisted.

Philippine Supreme Court halts closure of commercial blood banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Supreme Court has
ordered the health department to halt its closure of all commercial
blood banks after owners claimed the action was unconstitutional.
	   The country's 29 commercial blood banks were officially closed
May 28 after a four-year grace period in an effort to avoid tainted
blood from paid donors.
	   Only blood banks run by the government and the Red Cross, which
use donated blood, are now allowed to operate. Violators face a
fine of up to 500,000 pesos (dlrs 13,200) and a prison term of 12
to 20 years.
	   Owners of the blood banks, however, said the closures violated
the constitution and would create an ``unparalleled medical
disaster'' by reducing the amount of blood available.
	   The court asked health officials to respond to the allegations
within 10 days.
	   The Supreme Court's temporary restraining order, issued Tuesday,
was made available to reporters on Thursday.
	   The Department of Health pushed the 4-yera-old law's passage
because of an upsurge in diseases caused by blood from commercial
blood banks. A department study showed people selling blood were
generally impoverished and resorted to the practice to earn money.
	   The study showed the sellers were more likely to have contagious
diseases such as malaria, syphilis, hepatitis and HIV than those
who donate blood.
	   Blood from commercial banks has caused at least 11 cases of HIV
infections, which can cause AIDS, the health office said.
	   A U.S.-funded study of commercial blood in the Philippines in
1994 found that out of 426 donors, 13 were infected with
hepatitis-B and two others were HIV-positive.

Philippines to unveil new CPI Friday with higher figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will unveil
a new consumer price index on Friday that will use 1994 as a base
year instead of 1988, and a modified basket of goods and services
to reflect people's changed preferences.
	   The National Statistics Office said it will probably issue two
separate inflation figures until August, after which it will use
only the 1994-based CPI data.
	   NSO administrator Tomas Africa said the new CPI may prompt the
government to review its economic targets because the new price
indicators point to higher inflation figures. Inflation data are a
factor in determining interest rates and money supply.
	   ``But we are leaving that decision to the new economic team,''
said Africa, referring to the economic managers of newly elected
President Joseph Estrada, who assumes office June 30.
	   Average inflation for 1997 was calculated at 5.9 percent using
the new CPI index. The old index showed it to be 5 percent.
	   NSO attributed the difference to the change in the market basket
and the weights of goods and services. Food, beverage and tobacco
remains the largest component of the market basket, but its weight
has been reduced to 55.118 percent from 58.480 percent.
	   For April this year, the new index places year-on-year inflation
at 8.9 percent compared with the old index's 7.8 percent, a slight
downward revision from the 7.9 percent reported last month.
	   Average inflation between January and April based on the new CPI
was 8.175 percent compared with 7.2 percent under the old index.
The figures are still within or below the government's average
inflation target for the year of 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent.

For the first time under Chinese rule, Hong Kong recalls June 4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong met its first anniversary of the
Tiananmen massacre under Chinese rule on Thursday with plans for
its customary candlelight vigil, largely confident that Beijing
would not interfere.
	   Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 students protest in Beijing that
was crushed by the army, was to speak by telephone hookup from the
United States, where he was sent after his release from a Chinese
prison in April.
	   Hong Kong officials allowed more than 2,000 people to march
through the downtown area on Sunday, and there was no indication
they would interfere with Thursday night's memorial.
	   ``We must all work together so that the democracy movement in
the mainland will move forward faster,'' Wang said in a statement
distributed by organizers of the vigil. ``On the day the June 4
verdict is overturned, Hong Kong people can go back to the
motherland and together we can finally see the victory and hear the
cheers.''
	   It was clear that Hong Kong was less worried about its return to
Chinese rule than it was last June 4, less than a month before the
handover that ended more than 140 years of British rule. About
55,000 people turned out for last year's rally.
	   Although there are some worries about erosion of the rule of law
in Hong Kong, Beijing generally is regarded as having kept its
pledge to allow Hong Kong to keep its own system and run its own
affairs.
	   Instead, Hong Kong's chief concern is its faltering economy,
which is sliding into recession.
	   Media also widely quoted a poll by the University of Hong Kong's
Social Research Center that indicated the number of people who
thought Beijing had done wrong by sending in the army had fallen
over the last two years. Although still a majority, at 55 percent,
it was far lower than the 72 percent who thought so two years ago.

Report: Organizers still short of money for September games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Organizers of the Kuala Lumpur
Commonwealth Games are battling to meet a 33 million ringgit (dlrs
8.9 million) shortfall needed to host the competition, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Abdul Manaf Ibrahim, chief operating officer of the organizing
committee was quoted by New Straits Times as saying organizers had
to raise the money in the three months before the games. The amount
is 10 percent of the games budget.
	   ``It is by no means an easy task to raise about 11 million
ringgit (dlrs 2.9 million) a month,'' he said.
	   The official appealed for public help to raise the money. ``Any
contributions we receive would be timely, especially when we are
living under a cloud of economic uncertainty.''
	   Most of the shortfall is due to poor sales of advance tickets.
Officials said only 7 percent of the 1.2 million tickets for the
10-day event has been sold so far.
	   Tickets will be available at booths across the country starting
next month, but it is unlikely that they would be sold out quickly
because of the economic downturn in Malaysia that has left many
middle-class households poorer.
	   While the government has little cash to spare, many private
companies hurt by the stock exchange slide have cut back
advertising budgets.
	   More than 4,100 athletes from 67 countries were expected to
participate in the 16th Commonwealth Games, ranked second only to
the Olympics. Malaysia is the first Asian host for the games.

VW buys British engine company, moving closer to Rolls-Royce deal
</HEADLINE>
  EDs: LEADS with more details of Vickers' strategy, chairman quotes,
information about threat of bid from Rolls-Royce enthusiasts,
adding byline; no pickup
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG accelerated its plans to buy
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., agreeing Thursday also to purchase a
high-performance engine company from the parent of the fabled
luxury automaker.
	   Vickers PLC has agreed to sell Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen for 430
million pounds (dlrs 700 million) and hopes to get final approval
from shareholders on Friday. Just before that crucial meeting,
Vickers said early Thursday that Volkswagen will buy its Cosworth
engine company for 120 million pounds (dlrs 196 million) as part of
the Rolls-Royce deal.
	   Cosworth makes some of the engines for Rolls-Royce, but the
acquisition would only be a partial solution if Volkswagen's rival,
German carmaker BMW, makes good on a threat to cut off supplying
engines for Rolls-Royce after any sale of the company to VW.
	   BMW had agreed earlier to purchase Rolls-Royce for 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) and says it won't change the offer, which
shareholders also must consider.
	   The Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler, issued a statement
saying the Cosworth deal ``underlines the case'' for selling
Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen, and that it would give Volkswagen
``direct access to a British-based source of engineering skills and
engine supply.''
	   Cosworth also makes engines for the luxury carmaker Jaguar,
owned by the Ford Motor Co.
	   A Vickers spokesman, Neil Hayes, sought to play down the
significance of BMW's threat, although he acknowledged that the
Cosworth engines would be only a ``resource'' rather than a full
solution if the BMW engines are taken away from Rolls-Royce.
	   ``On that front, it's been a noise we've heard, but Volkswagen
are alert to it,'' Hayes said.
	   Vickers said it hopes to complete the sale of Rolls-Royce by
July 3, although a group of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts is seeking to
break up the deal with a new bid.
	   The leader, London lawyer Michael Shrimpton, tried previously
but failed to organize a bid for Rolls-Royce and it was unclear
whether he can do any better this time. Shrimpton said early
Thursday he would have a statement later in the day. He declined to
elaborate.
	   Vickers tried on Tuesday to shrug off any new bids, saying it
had a good, solid arrangement with Volkswagen that it did not want
to jeopardize.
	   Vickers, an engineering group based in London, said last year it
would sell Rolls-Royce as part of its strategy of focusing on other
business, including defense. Selling Cosworth engines would further
that strategy, Chandler said.

Stocks fall on concerns over Wall Street and local economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks closed sharply lower on
Thursday, dragged down by losses on Wall Street and concern about
the territory's troubled economy.
	   A day after breaking a long losing streak, the blue-chip Hang
Seng Index opened lower and sank throughout the day. It closed at
8,558, a loss of more than 260 points, or 3 percent.
	   Market volume slipped to 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars, down
from 5.72 billion Hong Kong dollars in the previous session.
	   ``Market sentiment is still quite weak, despite the government
measures to boost economic activities and employment,'' said Alex
Tang, research director at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International.
	   On Wednesday, the government unveiled a program to create
100,000 jobs over the next 18 months. Hong Kong is suffering from
its highest unemployment in 14 years, and the government announced
on Friday that the economy contracted 2 percent in the first
quarter of the year.
	   Tang said the job-creation plan announced Wednesday and a
previous economic stimulus plan announced last Friday failed to
impress investors.
	   ``More and more people are holding quite a bearish view of the
market. They believe the worst is not over yet,'' he said.
	   Added to the Hang Seng's woes was the Dow's overnight fall of
87.44 points.
	   Cheung Kong Holdings lost 1.60 Hong Kong dollars to 39.10, Hang
Seng Bank fell 1.50 to 50.50, HSBC Holdings fell 5 to 185,
Hutchinson Whampoa lost 2 to end at 38, and Sun Hung Kai Properties
ended the day at 35.10, down 1.70.

  UNITED STATES: Agreement on Cuba will hit Castro, administration
says  

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A U.S. agreement with the European Union would
ease trade sanctions against companies that do business with Cuba
but also would hit the island's president, Fidel Castro, the
Clinton administration said Wednesday.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told a congressional
panel the administration will seek approval from Congress to waive
a provision in the sanctions that denies U.S. visas to foreign
executives of companies that do business on expropriated U.S.
property in Cuba. The agreement requires congressional approval.
	   The chairman of the House International Relations Committee
indicated any administration legislation to ease Cuban sanctions
may be dead in the water.
  CUBA: Government cancels baseball game in spat with Nicaragua
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuba on Wednesday called off a
baseball game against Nicaragua, complaining of ``disrespectful and
ungentlemanly treatment'' by Nicaragua's government.
	   The cancellation of the weekend game was the latest move in a
diplomatic dispute between Cuba's communist government and
Nicaragua's strongly anti-Communist President Arnoldo Aleman.
	   With the Bahamas trying to deport some 200 Cubans _ including
several baseball players _ who had arrived there by raft, Aleman
offered to grant visas so they would not have to return to Cuba.
The Bahamas returned the refugees anyway.
	   Aleman said the offer still stood if Cuba would let the
refugeess leave Cuba. Cuba said it would let any Cuban go except
the 200 Aleman had invited.
  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Caller claims drug bomb, threatens Dominican
newspaper
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A telephone caller
claimed responsibility Wednesday for a bombing outside the
Dominican anti-drug agency, and threatened an attack on a leading
newspaper.
	   Ultima Hora newspaper reported that a woman caller warned:
``What we did to Drugs was just an example -- we have you in our
sights.''
	   The newspaper quoted the woman as saying that a group, which she
did not identify by name, had orchestrated the bombing outside the
National Drug Control Directorate. The explosion, early Monday,
left a one-foot-deep (30-centimeter-deep) crater in the pavement
and broke windows. No one was hurt.
	   An Ultima Hora reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that the newspaper had angered drug lords by supporting the
extradition of suspects to the United States.
  BAHAMAS: Hundreds of hotel workers strike in pay dispute
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Hundreds of hotel workers went on strike
Wednesday at the two largest hotels in the Bahamas, over a
long-simmering pay dispute.
	   More than 1,000 workers were staging what they called a
``sit-in'' at the 1,250-room Atlantis Resort belonging to Sun
International and at the Marriott's Crystal Palace resort, both on
Paradise Island off Nassau, the official Bahamas Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
	   The strike comes at the height of a busy tourist season during
which many hotels have suffered from a ``go-slow'' staged by
workers since contract negotiations broke down in early April.
  UNITED STATES: Audit questions contracts under Jamaican-born
housing director
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ When the Tampa Housing Authority had a
Jamaican-born director, the agency handed more than dlrs 6 million
in contracts to contractors from Jamaica and their partners, a
recent federal audit found.
	   The same audit also found that many of those contracts were
awarded without bidding and had little oversight by the housing
authority.
	   The Inspector General's Office of the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development carried out the audit, noting it found
problems of favoritism, missing documents, contracts routinely
awarded without bids and private contractors getting jobs intended
for public housing residents.
	   The audit covered Tampa Housing Authority business from 1994
through October 1997. During most of that period, Audley Evans, who
was born in Jamaica, was director of the housing authority.
  ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: Opposition seeks to end 14-year
government
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Opposition parties hope to seize
on a 45 percent unemployment rate to unseat Prime Minister Sir
James Mitchell, who has governed St. Vincent and the Grenadines
since 1984.
	   Mitchell says he'll leave politics if his New Democratic Party
loses June 15 parliamentary elections.
	   ``The people are ready for change, and we are prepared to
deliver it,'' said Ralph Gonsalves, deputy leader of the opposition
Unity Labor Party.
	   Unity Labor and the People's Working Party point to endemic
unemployment and the shaky state of the banana industry as reasons
for change.
	   The World Trade Organization ruled last year that European Union
incentives for Caribbean banana exports constituted unfair trade.
  JAMAICA: Government gives plots of land to World Cup team
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ No matter what their fortunes in this
month's World Cup playoffs, Jamaican national soccer team players
all will have plots of land to call home when they return to the
Caribbean.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson presented sales
agreements for parcels of land to each of the team's 22 players
Wednesday during an official send-off.
	   Called the Reggae Boyz, it is the first Jamaican team to win a
berth in the international competition, and the first from an
English-speaking Caribbean nation.
	   ``We have created history and excitement but we are going to
create even more history and excitement by what we achieve by our
performance in France,'' Patterson said. ``There are more miracles
yet to be revealed.''

Tokyo stocks bounce back modestly, dollar edged higher
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices bounced back modestly Thursday,
with afternoon selling eating up some of its early gains. The U.S.
dollar edged higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 79.47 points,
or 0.52 percent, closing at 15,426.47 points. On Wednesday, the
index lost 207.45 points, or 1.33 percent.
	   Share prices moved into positive territory following a rise in
futures prices at midday Thursday, with the Nikkei index moving
above 15,500 points at one point.
	   But the main index shed some of its early gains amid a fall on
Hong Kong stock prices, traders said.
	   A lack of other fresh market-moving news left many investors on
the sidelines, with an estimated 277 million shares changed hands
on the first section, down from Wednesday's 358.89 million shares.
	   Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 566 to 497, with 202
issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,207.50. The
TOPIX lost 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 138.16 yen, up 0.40 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
138.75 yen overnight. It ranged between 137.96 yen and 138.50 yen
in Thursday's trading.
	   The dollar's relative weakness from late Wednesday's levels in
New York came after hedge funds and other U.S. players took profits
amid concern about next Tuesday's meeting in Paris of deputy
finance ministers from G-7 industrialized nations.
	   Traders said there remains no change in the overall
dollar-buying trend against the yen. Japanese institutional
investors bought the dollar when it hit 138 yen, keeping the
currency from falling below that.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond edged down to 1.135 percent from Wednesday's finish
of 1.150 percent, driving its price up to 112.54 yen from 112.43
yen.

Rattling first warning for passengers in Germany's train disaster
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with more bodies recovered.  
  By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Commuters taking the Inter-City Express
train along the Munich-to-Hamburg line are normally assured of a
smooth ride in business-class size reclining seats.
	   The train _ which travels up to 175 mph (280 kph) _ feels
motionless, allowing passengers to tap out reports on laptops, sip
coffee or doze undisturbed during their trip.
	   That's why passengers on Germany's fastest train were so alarmed
Wednesday by the rattling.
	   ``I had the feeling that maybe something was lying on the
tracks,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, a passenger from a rear car,
told SAT 1 TV.
	   ``People looked at each other shocked, and then it was as if:
`That's over now.''' But then the rattling ``started up again,'' he
said.
	   A moment later, the train's lead locomotive somehow broke loose
and car after car jumped off the track, crumpling into each other
and slamming into a bridge, bringing it down on top of the
wreckage.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Schliebener said. ``Thank God, it came to
a standstill.''
	   Then he heard the screaming.
	   Several passenger cars had wedged together, some sticking up at
bizarre angles and others buried under the overpass.
	   The train was traveling at 125 mph (200 kph) when it crashed.
Authorities said at least 100 people died; rescuers pulled out more
than 80 bodies by early Thursday, and two victims died from their
injuries in hospitals.
	   Dazed survivors staggered with bloodied hands toward residents
who came running out of houses just 150 feet (45 meters) away.
Splintered glass covered the ground.
	   Within an hour the nearby small, red-brick town of Eschede _
about 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of Hanover _ was swarming with
fire trucks, rescue workers and volunteers.
	   Hannelore Domkewitz saw the train speed past from her kitchen
window where she stood peeling potatoes. She had just a moment to
reflect that it was moving faster than usual.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Domkewitz said.
	   The silence didn't last long. There were screams from the
tracks, about 300 feet (90 meters) away.
	   Domkewitz ran to get blankets and bed sheets to cover the
injured and dead. ``But there were also survivors who went by with
their luggage. They were all in shock,'' Domkewitz said, her voice
breaking.

Kashmir called source of newly nuclear India-Pakistan rivalry

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An international meeting Thursday on
India's nuclear rivalry with Pakistan likely means that the world's
original nuclear powers will address the main dispute between the
two countries: Kashmir.
	   The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways
to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race. India and
Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both
are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
	   No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three
times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing
Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of
Economics' Asia Research Center.
	   One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by
officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both
countries claim.
	   ``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I
think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain
said.
	   Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be
addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists
it remain a bilateral issue. Now, Hussain said, India fears the
Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
	   India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while
Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting
Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
rejected the possibility of international mediation. Vajpayee
repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
	   Indian foreign ministry officials have refused comment on the
Geneva talks, saying they will respond only to specific
recommendations made by the five foreign secretaries, meeting as
the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council at the European
headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory
called a general strike Thursday in Srinagar, capital of India's
Jammu-Kashmir state, to coincide with the Geneva meeting, saying
they believe the world was now paying attention to their protests.
	   India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training
anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only
moral support.

Mir ready for docking with U.S. shuttle, TV transmission
</HEADLINE>
  By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station is in ``perfect order''
and ready to relay TV pictures of its rendezvous with U.S. space
shuttle Discovery, whose communications system is out of order,
space officials said Thursday.
	   Discovery is scheduled to hook up with Mir around 9 p.m. Moscow
time (1700 GMT) Thursday and remain linked to the station for four
days. It will bring home astronaut Andrew Thomas, the seventh and
last American to live on Mir.
	   ``You will have the exclusive rights for TV coverage,'' a ground
controller joked while telling Mir's crew about Discovery's
problem.
	   Because of a failure of an antenna in Discovery's communication
system, live images of the docking and the meeting of two crews
will come from Mir's cameras, said Russian Mission Control
spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova.
	   Mir has been running smoothly since Monday when cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin fixed a three-day computer
breakdown which disabled the station's steering system and
threatened to delay the docking.
	   ``All the station's systems are now in perfect order,''
Medvedkova told The Associated Press. ``We are fully ready for the
docking.''
	   Mir's main computer failed on Saturday, leaving the station
unstable and its energy supply in jeopardy if its solar panels lost
their alignment with the sun.
	   Computer breakdowns plagued the aging space outpost all through
1997, and the previous shuttle ferry flight in January brought a
new computer which had worked trouble-free until Saturday's
failure. The crew used another back-up computer and other spares to
fix the problem.
	   Medvedkova said the crew woke up three hours later than usual
Thursday to adjust their schedule to that of Discovery. They will
spend the time left before the docking to finish packing science
gear used by Thomas and his six NASA predecessors.

U.N. Environment Program: `It's War' against Indonesian fires
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CORRECTS spelling of `Illueca' sted `Illueco' throughout  
  By LAURINDA KEYS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It will take wartime resources to put out the
remaining Indonesian forest fires, and there is a good chance of
new fires and more haze over Southeast Asia, a senior U.N. official
said Thursday.
	   ``It is not merely firefighting anymore. It is a war against the
fires,'' said Jorge Illueca, assistant executive director of the
U.N. Environment Program.
	   The problem ``requires large-scale wartime mobilization of
resources such as personnel, equipment, logistics and
telecommunications,'' Illueca told the Singapore Environment
Council.
	   Although the end of the El Nino weather pattern should ease the
14-month drought, the normal dry season expected to last until
October is sufficient to produce new, widespread fires, and
resulting haze, he said.
	   It is in the dry season that local farmers and large plantation
or timber companies clear land by setting vegetation on fire. These
practices are chiefly blamed for the burning of 2 million hectares
(4.9 million acres) of rain forest, timber and grassland from July
1997 to this April.
	   The return of the same atmospheric patterns that enveloped
cities in the region with smoke and ash last year can be expected
again, Illueca said. If there are huge, uncontrolled fires, the
wind patterns and inversion layers will be the same, and the health
effects will compound respiratory and other ailments suffered last
year.
	   Most of the major fires in East Kalimantan, the Indonesian
portion of Borneo Island, have been subdued, the Singapore
Meteorological Service reported Thursday, based on satellite
photographs.
	   But Illueca said 30 fires are still burning out of control in
inaccessible areas where the drought has depleted the water that
the mostly ill-trained firefighters need. Efforts are aimed at
limiting the blazes with firebreaks.
	   Also, he and other international environmentalists have noted
that the underground peat moss fires, which can spread rapidly and
are the hardest to extinguish, are difficult to detect by
satellite.
	   The United States, Canada and Australia have volunteered to send
firefighting equipment and disaster managers when another major
conflagration erupts this year, Illueca said. But he noted that the
political turmoil in Indonesia has caused many potential donors of
money, manpower and equipment to hold back.
	   ``The immediate future is bleak unless assistance is provided or
sufficient rain falls to stop the fires,'' Illueca said.
	   Although some rain has come, it is unlikely to be extensive,
long lasting or heavy enough to completely extinguish even the
current blazes, much less new fires that normally erupt during the
dry season.
	   ``The rains will eventually come,'' Illueca said. ``The fires
will go out. But not before there is irreparable loss of
biodiversity and valuable resources are destroyed.''

Outgoing Philippine president gives successor tour of presidential
</HEADLINE>
palace

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos guided
successor Joseph Estrada around the presidential palace Thursday,
giving him household tips, including ways of warding off evil
spirits.
	   ``This is the biggest challenge of my life,'' Estrada said after
arriving with his wife and children for the two-hour tour.
	   The two leaders prayed in a chapel before Ramos led the Estradas
on the tour of the Malacanang presidential palace, a guest house,
barracks of presidential guards and a nine-hole golf course.
	   So far, the transfer of power to Estrada has proceeded smoothly
despite predictions of resistance from Ramos' camp. Estrada, an
opposition leader, will be the Philippines' third president since
the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos was ousted by a ``people
power'' revolt in 1986.
	   At one point, Ramos stopped in front of a huge ficus tree in the
lawn fronting the palace and suggested to Estrada that he put a lot
of glass on that side of the palace to ward off evil spirits said
to be inhabiting the tree.
	   Chinese geomancers, called in by Ramos shortly after he took
power in 1992, said evil spirits might be thriving on the tree, a
type that superstitious Filipinos say is a favorite abode of
hostile spirits.
	   Estrada told reporters that he will be the first president since
Marcos to live inside the palace, located along the bank of Pasig
River in Manila's crowded San Miguel residential district, but
would open it up to the people.
	   The palace was built in the early 1800s as the summer residence
of the Spanish governor-general. The Spanish colonial government
made it the seat of power in 1863 when an earthquake destroyed the
governor-general's office in the nearby Intramuros district.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession from 1565 to 1898.
	   After Marcos' ouster, the palace was turned into a museum
showing his family's opulent lifestyle.
	   Estrada has said he will live in Malacanang only six months a
year, splitting the rest of the time between the two other major
regions of the country to reach out to the people.
	   Ramos has scheduled a series of briefings to make the turnover
of the presidency as smooth as possible.
	   On Monday, Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre, a retired
general who has been retained by Estrada as his national security
adviser, briefed Estrada and Vice President-elect Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo on national security.
	   Estrada, elected in May 11 polls, gained a devoted following
among the country's many poor during a career as a movie star
portraying tough guys who stood up to injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   Estrada says he will continue most of Ramos' policies but will
focus on helping the poor and developing the country's agriculture.
He also has pledged to crack down on official corruption and solve
the country's severe crime problem within six months.

Croatian teachers strike to protest wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Teachers in elementary and high schools
throughout Croatia went on a one-day strike Thursday, protesting
the government's failure to raise wages.
	   The second such strike in two weeks comes amid year-ending
examinations.
	   Two teachers' unions, which represent 80 percent of all
teachers, threatened to extend the warning strike indefinitely if
the government continued rejecting their demands, a move that could
jeopardize the completion of the year's curriculum.
	   The government initially offered a 12.5 percent hike on average
salaries equivalent to dlrs 360 a month and holiday reimbursements,
but backed down Wednesday saying it could not afford the deal.
	   ``Our demands are unchanged ... but the government is trying to
buy extra time,'' said Vesna Kanizaj, president of the Union of
Teachers.
	   A majority of teachers apparently participated in Thursday's
strike.
	   Social discontent is on the rise across Croatia as ordinary
people struggle to stretch their wages from month to month.
	   Analysts believe the increasing hardships could become the first
real dent to President Franjo Tudjman's eight-year rule in next
year's elections.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In spite of Asia's sharp economic downturn, job
opportunities for the region's top executives are still plentiful
among industrial companies, a leading executive search firm said
Thursday.
	   Multinational industrial companies accounted for 31 percent of
total demand for executives in the first quarter of 1998, up from
18 percent in the same period last year, according to data compiled
by Korn-Ferry International.
	   The company said international firms see Asia's economic slump
as an opportunity to enter new markets and they are preparing to
expand in the region over the next twenty years by snapping up some
of the best of the local talent.
	   Korn-Ferry said demand for executives continues to rise in other
countries, too. Worldwide demand for executives earning more than
dlrs 100,000 rose by seven percent in the first quarter of 1998.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Moving to restore investor confidence,
President Kim Dae-jung ordered a crackdown Thursday on South
Korea's bloated, debt-ridden conglomerates.
	   Rejecting their earlier recommendations, the president told the
nation's bankers to include subsidiaries of the conglomerates in a
list of companies that will be forced to close later this month.
	   Coming on the eve of his departure for the United States, where
he hopes to drum up new investment next week, the move reflected
Kim's impatience with the slow pace of South Korea's reforms.
	   The government had ordered the country's leading banks to come
up with a list of companies so deeply in debt they are no longer
viable and then shut them down by calling in their old loans and
refusing to provide new ones.
	   That, many analysts said, was like asking a wolf to guard the
henhouse because closing major companies would force the already
over-extended banks to assume their debt.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co. plans to cut production at its
Smyrna, Tennessee plant by 25 percent this year due to sluggish
U.S. sales.
	   Nissan will reduce output at the plant to about 300,000 vehicles
this year from 400,000 last year by shutting assembly lines every
Friday until early October, a Nissan spokesman said Thursday.
	   Most employees will be given the day off with pay, although some
may be asked to do non-production work at the plant. Nissan will
not layoff any workers.
	   The cut is designed to trim inventories, which have grown amid
sluggish sales in the United States. Nissan makes its Altima and
Sentra sedans and Frontier pickups at the plant.
	   Sluggish small car sales in the United States had forced Nissan
earlier this year to freeze hiring, cut overtime at the plant, and
idle production lines for longer than usual during the Easter and
Memorial Day holidays.
	   Combined sales of vehicles produced at the Tennessee plant fell
by 6 percent last year and continue to be weak this year.
	   Nissan has said it is considering moving production of the
Maxima sedan from Japan to the Tennessee plant, though not until
after 2000.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Meeting a government drive to boost
profits and improve safety, Taiwan's UNI Airlines said Thursday it
is merging with two other carriers.
	   The government's Fair Trade Commission gave its approval
Wednesday for UNI to absorb Formosa and Taiwan airlines. The move
will give UNI 32 planes on 23 domestic and five foreign routes,
said Paul Cheng, UNI's senior vice president.
	   Merging the airlines will cut costs by 10-15 percent, giving the
airline a competitive edge in the crowded industry, Cheng said.
	   ``The deal is particularly efficient because there is very
little overlap in routes between the airlines now,'' Cheng said.
``Now everywhere in Taiwan, we can fly.''
	   Taiwan's government pushed for consolidation following a string
of accidents this year, including the crash of a China Airlines
Airbus on Feb. 16 in which 202 people died.
	   Few carriers make money in the domestic market, and a profusion
of airlines and types are blamed for maintainence and safety
problems.
	   EVA Airlines, which is owned by the Evergreen Group, will
control a roughly 60 percent stake in the expanded UNI, Cheng said.
EVA now holds 75 percent of UNI and Taiwan Airlines, and 26 percent
of Great China, Cheng said.
	   He said UNI expects approval from the Securities and Futures
Commission and Transportation Ministry by June 30.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting Japan's sluggish economy, sales of
imported cars, buses and trucks fell 15.6 percent in May from the
year-earlier month to 19,335 units, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said Thursday.
	   It was the 14th straight month of declines.
	   The sale of imported passenger cars was down 13.1 percent to
18,476, while the sale of imported trucks plunged 47.9 percent to
859. No imported buses were sold during the month.
	   The figures were seen as another indication of consumer caution
as Japan's economy remains moribund despite government efforts to
revive it, including the announcement last month of this country's
largest ever economic stimulus package.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will unveil
a new consumer price index on Friday that will use 1994 as a base
year instead of 1988, and a modified basket of goods and services
to reflect people's changed preferences.
	   The National Statistics Office said it will probably issue two
separate inflation figures until August, after which it will use
only the 1994-based CPI data.
	   NSO administrator Tomas Africa said the new CPI may prompt the
government to review its economic targets because the new price
indicators point to higher inflation figures. Inflation data are a
factor in determining interest rates and money supply.
	   Average inflation for 1997 was calculated at 5.9 percent using
the new CPI index. The old index showed it to be 5 percent.

Duma postpones START II hearings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament's lower house decided
Thursday to postpone by one week their scheduled hearings on
ratifying the long-delayed START II treaty.
	   The State Duma's agenda-setting council decided that the
hearings planned for June 9 should be moved to June 16 because two
top government ministers will be out of the country on the earlier
date, said deputy Duma speaker Vladimir Ryzhkov.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov are to accompanying President Boris Yeltsin on a trip to
Germany on June 8-9, Ryzhkov said.
	   The Duma's closed-door hearings will take place at the
headquarters of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces.
About one-third of 450 Duma members will take part in the
discussion.
	   On Wednesday, ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky urged
the Duma to put off the hearings until the fall, but his motion
failed.
	   However, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, has warned
that the hearings will be shelved if U.S. President Bill Clinton
continues to pressure Russia to pass the treaty.
	   Clinton has said he would prefer to come to Moscow for a summit
with Yeltsin after START II has been ratified as the two leaders
are set to discuss further strategic arms cuts.
	   START II was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, and Yeltsin
has long been urging the Duma to do the same.
	   But Communists and other hard-liners who dominate the Duma have
opposed the treaty saying that Russia lacks funds for dismantling
weapons and claiming that the cuts would also damage its security.
	   The treaty would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals to
3,500 warheads each.

Japan checks bullet trains after fatal wreck in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Railway Co. on Thursday began special
inspections of its bullet train lines following the high-speed
train crash in Germany that killed at least 100 people.
	   The company has also sent an employee to the accident site in
Eschede, northern Germany, to study why the 14-carriage German
Inter-City Express train to derail Wednesday, a JR spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka said that
Japan is ready to extend assistance to Germany and that Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was preparing to send his condolences to
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to Kyodo News.
	   Earier, Hashimoto reportedly said that the accident served as a
reminder of the ``dangerousness'' of high-speed trains.
	   East Japan Railway Co., a JR group company, will inspect 59
points where bullet trains pass over or under roads because of
speculation the German crash may have been caused by a passenger
car falling from a bridge onto the locomotive.
	   Japan's bullet trains, which run at speeds up to 270 kilometers
(169 miles) per hour, have never derailed since the service began
in 1964.

ARU bans brothel sponsorship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Western Australia's women's rugby union
team has been banned from taking sponsorship from a local brothel.
	   The Australian Rugby Union blocked the Aust dlrs 10,000 (U.S.
dlrs 6,200) sponsorship, which the Western Amazons planned to use
to travel to the national championships in Darwin next month.
	   Amazons coach Sue Roberts attacked the ARU's stance and
described it as hypocritical.
	   ``Sport should be apolitical and amoral,'' Roberts said. ``We
believe alcohol has brought more misery, abuse, accidents and
health problems to women's and children's lives than a brothel ever
has. Yet the Western Australian Rugby Union is sponsored by a
brewery.''
	   Sponsorship trouble is nothing new for the Amazons. They first
came to attention last year when they were sponsored by a Perth
scaffolding company and wore shorts with the slogan ``Instant
Erections.''
	   WA Rugby Union executive director, Terry Wilkinson, said the
team had gone too far in this case.
	   ``We've told them that it is outside the ARU code of conduct,''
Wilkinson said. ``We didn't feel it appropriate for a
representative team as brothels are not legal at the moment. It's a
little disappointing that they haven't accepted the decision
without trying to gain some publicity.''
	   Although prostitution is illegal in Western Australia, it
operates under a containment policy and there are a number of
well-known brothels in the Perth metropolitan area.

Russia's market rally continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's stock market rebounded further Thursday
despite the government's insistence that a quick bailout package
was unlikely.
	   Expectation of such emergency aid has buoyed Russia's troubled
financial markets, which have regained much of the ground they lost
last week when jittery investors began to pull out of Russia.
	   By midday, Russia's stock exchange had climbed another 4
percent, following increases of 12 percent Tuesday and 8 percent
Wednesday.
	   Many analysts have credited the improvement to rumors of new
lending from the International Monetary Fund or others to ease the
government's desperate cash flow problem.
	   But the Kremlin has expressed little enthusiasm for a bailout
package like the ones offered to Asian countries. A Finance
Ministry spokesman insisted late Wednesday that Russia hasn't
requested emergency aid, and will announce a new borrowing program
by early next week.
	   All the same, analysts say some sort of a package is likely
since some Western financial institutions, particularly German
banks, have significant stakes in the Russian market.
	   Meanwhile, Russia is taking its own measures to raise cash,
making a surprise Eurobond offer Thursday to raise dlrs 1.2
billion. That followed a treasury bill auction Wednesday to raise
dlrs 16.5 billion, some of it from rare, one-week treasury bills.
	   Russia's financial crisis began last week with a steep drop in
the stock market that many feared could lead to a run on the ruble
_ which could cause political as well as economic turmoil in the
former superpower.

Hezbollah attack in south Lebanon wounds Israeli soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas detonated a bomb as an
Israeli patrol drove on a road in an occupied zone of southern
Lebanon early Thursday, officials said. One soldier was wounded.
	   Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the roadside bombing took place near the village of
Haddatha on the edge of the occupied area that Israel calls a
``security zone.''
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said one soldier was
wounded.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said guerrillas detected
Israeli troop movements near Haddatha at 2 a.m. (2300 GMT
Wednesday) and attacked with ``appropriate weapons,'' scoring
``direct hits.''
	   Haddatha is on the northern edge of the occupied enclave, about
10 kilometers (six miles) north of Israel's northern border.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war against
the 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militias in the
zone, which makes up 10 percent of Lebanon's territory.
	   Israel or its allies have controlled the border zone since 1978.
In 1985, the Israeli government established the zone in its present
form with the aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla attacks on
its northern towns.

Nuclear powers gather in Geneva to discuss South Asian fears

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
Thursday put into high gear their campaign against a South Asian
arms race threatened by Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   A diplomat close to the meeting said China, Britain, France,
Russia and the United States planned to use their emergency meeting
``to find a formula for defusing the tension'' between the two
rival countries.
	   ``They see their role as one facilitating a reduction of tension
in the subcontinent and to persuade India and Pakistan to sign up
to the global regime against nuclear proliferation,'' said the
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who is chairing the
meeting, has ruled out joint sanctions against India and Pakistan,
but experts from the five countries have been putting together a
common position.
	   Tang will try to stop the arms race between China's neighbors,
fearing it could encourage still more countries to obtain nuclear
weapons, Chinese officials said in Beijing.
	   ``We should urge them with one voice and make them realize it's
not in their interest,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao in Beijing.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, in Geneva fresh from
visits to India and Pakistan, told disarmament negotiators from 61
countries Thursday the ``lack of serious intention'' by the five
powers was a contributing factor to the arms race.
	   But he said he, too, preferred ``to concentrate on the
positive'' and backed an effort to defuse the tensions between the
countries that neighbor Iran.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   Tang was meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and separately with other top diplomats in preparation for a
hastily arranged joint session late in the day. Albright was also
meeting separately with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
said Albright. ``These two countries are cheek-by-jowl.''
	   As he sent off Albright from Washington, U.S. President Bill
Clinton promised to work to end nuclear competition between the
Asian rivals.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.''
	   In Washington, a top official said that in the Geneva meetings
Thursday, Albright would seek common ground among the five original
nuclear powers.
	   But she would stop short of calling for joint sanctions on
Pakistan and India as that could be counterproductive, the official
said.
	   ``We want to defuse the current tensions,'' Karl F. Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, told a Senate
hearing.
	   Also attending the meeting at the European headquarters of the
United Nations are British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They also are all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India. Neither
India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Inderfurth said the United States was adamant that neither India
nor Pakistan would join the club.
	   ``There is no disposition to reward any nation for blasting its
way into that nuclear-state category,'' he said.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan the status of nuclear powers without unraveling
the entire complex treaty negotiated in the late 1960s.
	   They are looking at other ways of bringing them into global,
step-by-step disarmament efforts.
	   The meeting will examine all initiatives which could help the
process of de-escalation or a cooling-down of the situation in the
region, said a spokeswoman for the French mission in Geneva.
	   The spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the meeting
would address two main themes, non-proliferation and the question
of security in the sub-continent.
	   ``Every initiative to promote security in the sub-continent
could be discussed,'' the spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Hundreds of workers lifted chunks of a
collapsed overpass with cranes Thursday to search for victims
trapped in passenger cars crushed and buried when the speediest
train on Germany's rails jumped the tracks.
	   At least 100 people died when the lead locomotive of
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 broke loose at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning, leaving behind 12 passenger
cars and a second locomotive that careened off the tracks and
crunched together like an accordion.
	   Rescuer workers expected to recover more bodies from a
first-class car and a severed dining car still wedged beneath the
arching ruins of the overpass, but said it was unlikely survivors
would be found.
	   ``We think the chances of finding further survivors are very
small,'' police spokesman Peter Hoppe said.
	   Eighty-nine bodies were recovered so far and two more people
died in the hospital. Lower-Saxony state officials said 200 people
were injured; 95 had been treated in hospitals for serious
injuries, according to police.
	   Twenty-four hours after the accident, there were no firm
estimates of how many people were on board the train, or how many
survivors might have walked away from the crash.
	   The scope of the tragedy, the worst on Germany's rails since
World War II, sent the nation into mourning _ and action to do
anything they could to help. Flags flew at half-staff at all public
buildings on Thursday. As news of the crash spread, Germans rushed
to donate blood at Red Cross centers throughout the country,
leaving work early and waiting for hours at some centers. In
Eschede, a red-roofed town of 6,500, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north
of Hanover, residents brought blankets for survivors, and later to
coffee and food to exhausted rescue workers.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, clearly shaken by the scope of
the calamity, cut short a trip to Italy. His challenger in national
elections in September, Lower Saxony state governor Gerhard
Schroeder, arrived at the Eschede rescue coordination center early
Thursday and pledged immediate assistance to victims and their
families.
	   ``Like everyone in Germany I am truly moved,'' Schroeder told
reporters. ``This has brought Germans closer together than in a
long time.''
	   It remained unclear why the lead locomotive decoupled from the
rest of the train.
	   Police said four cars separated from both the locomotive and the
rest of the train and cleared the overpass before derailing. Still
pushed by the rear engine, the others jumped the tracks into the
concrete supports of the overpass, collapsing it and jackknifing
into each other.
	   Oblivious to the catastrophe, the driver of the lead locomotive
continued through the Eschede train station, until the station
master engaged the emergency brake.
	   An investigation continued into the cause, though it was ``not
as intensive'' as recovery efforts, police spokesman Hoppe said.
``There is no indication that the derailment was anything other
than an accident.''
	   Deutsche Bahn executive Peter Muenschwander confirmed that two
workers who had been doing signal maintenance on an adjacent track
were still missing and presumed dead.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle just minutes before the accident.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said. ``Thank
God, it came to a standstill.''
	   As screams rang out from the wounded, dazed and bloodied
survivors staggered toward residents who came running out of houses
just 50 yards (150 feet) away. Splintered glass covered the ground.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers rushed to the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the country's deadliest train accident since World War II.
	   The ICE train connects all major cities at speed up to 280
kilometers (175 miles) an hour, cutting travel time from Munich to
Hamburg - a distance of more than 950 kilometers (about 600 miles)
by more than two hours.

Billy Joel cancels concert after asthma attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Singer Billy Joel, suffering from asthma, canceled
a joint concert with Sir Elton John on Thursday and apologized to
the nearly 30,000 fans who had tickets to the show in Manchester,
northern England.
	   ``I feel terrible about this, not only for my own fans, but for
Elton and his fans as well,'' Joel said.
	   ``To everyone who planned to attend the Manchester show tonight,
I convey my deepest apologies,'' the 49-year-old singer said in the
statement issued Thursday.
	   At the pair's opening concert in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday,
Joel suffered an acute asthma attack brought on by an upper
respiratory infection. Reviewers had noted bitter winds at the open
air concert.
	   ``This condition has caused the Manchester concert to be
canceled, and it will not be rescheduled,'' MCP Promotions said,
promising a full refund and adding its apologies.
	   The two remaining shows in the four-show series would go ahead
as planned in London's Wembley stadium this weekend, the promoters
said.

Japanese company develops new mouse-proof optical fiber cable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese company has found a spicy way to keep
mice from chewing up optical fiber cables _ red pepper.
	   Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd., a major Japanese electric
wire-maker, said Thursday it is the first company to come up with a
cable coated with synthetic _ but pungent _ spice.
	   ``It was developed by taking into account the mice's strong
dislike of red pepper,'' said Satoshi Maekawa, spokesman for the
Osaka-based company.
	   Optical fiber cables are frequently used in television
broadcasts or field events, and pesky rodents have been know to
feast on the cables.
	   The anti-mouse cable is covered with a thin polyethylene layer
and another thin protective layer. It is also 5 millimeters (0.2
inches) in diameter, one-third the size of conventional fiber
cables, Maekawa said.
	   The red pepper component is harmless to humans and the
environment, said.

Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary offers to buy Cosworth motor
</HEADLINE>
producers  

<TEXT>
	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) - German car-maker Audi, a subsidiary
of Volkswagen, said Thursday it was offering 350 million marks
(dlrs 197.7 million) to buy British-based Cosworth motor producers,
a subsidiary of Vickers.
	   In a statement from its headquarters in Ingolstadt, Audi said
both companies had already signed declarations of intent on the
deal, but it was contingent on whether Vickers stockholders vote to
sell its Rolls Royce division to Volkswagen and the sale is
consummated.
	   Vickers stockholders are to vote on who will buy its Rolls Royce
works on Friday. Top bidders are the Munich-based BMW and
Volkswagen in Wolfsburg.
	   Audi also said purchase of Cosworth still requires the approval
of both companies' supervisory boards.
	   Audi chairman of the board, Franz-Josef Paefgen said that
``Cosworth has an outstanding international reputation for
developing and producing high-performance motors, and therefore
fits well with Audi.''
	   Among Cosworth's products are motors for Formula One racing
cars.
	   Last year Audi produced about 546,000 cars with sales of more
than 22 billion marks (dlrs 12.4 billion). The German company
employs some 38,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa won the toss and sent
England into bat first in the first of the five cricket tests
Thursday at Edgbaston.
	   Hansie Cronje's decision was influenced by a heavily overcast
morning, although the pitch remained sparsely grassed and flat.
	   South Africa, made two changes to the side that clinched the
series against Sri Lanka _ replacing batsman Hylton Ackerman and
black fast bowler Makhaya Ntini with Jonty Rhodes and all rounder
Lance Klusener.
	   England, left out fast bowler Dean Headley and opted for two all
rounders _ Dominic Cork and Mark Ealham to play a supporting role
to swing bowler Angus Fraser and off spinner Robert Croft.
	   South Africa, named a sole spinner in unorthodox left-arm
spinner Paul Adams.
	   England: Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec
Stewart (captain), Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, Mark Ealham,
Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Darren Gough and Angus Fraser. Twelfth
man: Dean Headley.
	   South Africa (from): Gary Kirsten, Gehardus Liebenberg, Jacques
Kallis, Darryl Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes,
Shaun Pollock, Mark Boucher, Lance Klusener, Paul Adams, Allan
Donald. Twelfth man: Brian McMillan.

Indonesian student protesters tear down U.S. flag at consulate
</HEADLINE>

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student demonstrators on Thursday tore
down an American flag on the grounds of the U.S. consulate in
Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. Police arrested one
student.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, meanwhile, urged Americans to defer
non-essential travel to Indonesia, saying the political and
economic climate was still volatile.
	   Thousands of Americans and other foreigners fled Indonesia last
month as student protests and riots over price increases jolted the
capital, Jakarta. The unrest, which killed more than 1,000 people,
helped oust President Suharto after three decades in power.
	   At the rally in Surabaya, several dozen students from the
Islamic Muhammadiyah University gathered outside the U.S. consulate
for several hours to protest what they said was U.S. interference
in Indonesia's internal affairs.
	   One protester climbed onto the fence and lowered an American
flag from a pole, replacing it with a red and white Indonesian
flag. He was later arrested.
	   The demonstrators outside the consulate trampled on and tore up
the American flag. Diplomatic staff stayed inside the consulate.
	   U.S. officials at the consulate and the embassy declined to
comment.
	   Surabaya, which has a population of 3 million, is 800 kilometers
(500 miles) east of the capital.
	   Small groups of students have staged protests this week outside
the U.S. Embassy in the capital, accusing Washington of conspiring
to delay international loans for economically battered Indonesia.
	   The United States is a key player in the International Monetary
Fund, a 182-nation lending agency which suspended a dlrs 43 billion
bailout for Indonesia because of the political turmoil. The IMF is
reviewing when to restart loan disbursements.
	   In a travel advisory issued Thursday, the U.S. State Department
said that, ``Although violence has subsided, the political and
economic situation in Indonesia remains unsettled.''
	   Posted on the embassy's Internet home page, the warning to defer
non-essential travel was a softening of the U.S. government
position. Last month, the embassy urged Americans to defer all
travel to Indonesia.

Lawyer urges sacking of prosecutor who urged reversal of Marcos
</HEADLINE>
conviction  

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Filipino lawyer for human rights
victims who won a suit against the late President Ferdinand Marcos
asked the government Thursday to sack a prosecutor who recommended
a reversal of a graft conviction against Marcos' widow, Imelda.
	   Lawyer Rod Domingo said Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz
should be fired for his recommendation and prevented from handling
any future cases against the Marcoses.
	   ``With the state of mind of Solicitor General de la Cruz, he may
also recommend that all moneys, properties and assets be returned
to the Marcoses,'' he said.
	   Domingo represents one of two groups of human rights victims
claiming dlrs 540 million in Marcos' Swiss bank accounts.
	   About dlrs 300 million of the money, which has been frozen since
1986, was transferred in April into an escrow account in the
Philippine National Bank in Manila.
	   The rest of the money was blocked from being transferred
following appeals by Mrs. Marcos' Swiss lawyers.
	   The rights victims won a class action suit against Marcos in
Hawaii, where the former dictator was living at the time. A Hawaii
court awarded the victims dlrs 2 billion in damages from the Marcos
estate.
	   The Marcos family and the government also claim Marcos' wealth.
	   On Wednesday, de la Cruz asked the Supreme Court to reverse a
1993 graft conviction of Mrs. Marcos and spare her from a possible
12-year jail term.
	   The turnaround is a potential victory for Mrs. Marcos, but there
was no indication how the court will treat the recommendation. In
the past, the court has rarely reversed a decision it has upheld.
	   After reviewing the case, de la Cruz said he is convinced there
was no strong evidence proving Mrs. Marcos was guilty of the graft
charge.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted of graft, although she faces numerous other criminal and
civil cases related to the 20-year rule of her husband.
	   She and her husband have been accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986 ``people
power'' revolt and Marcos died three years later in exile in
Hawaii.
	   Mrs. Marcos was convicted of having granted leases on
government-owned land at improperly low rates to the Philippine
General Hospital Foundation, which she headed. The land was then
sublet to another company at much higher rates.
	   Mrs. Marcos _ who insists she did not personally benefit from
the deal _ said the money gained from the leases helped finance
construction of the Philippine Heart Center. Prosecutors did not
challenge this, but maintained that the foundation should have been
charged more.
	   A five-judge Supreme Court panel upheld her conviction in
January, but ruled that she could appeal one more time to the
entire court before going to prison. It sentenced her to nine to 12
years in prison and ordered her to pay 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.9
million) in damages to the government.
	   The Supreme Court has up to two years to decide the appeal.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he may pardon Mrs.
Marcos if the conviction is upheld.

China says critics in U.S. should join trend of better relations

  By RENEE SCHOOF  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday called on its critics in the
U.S. Congress to aid the improving relations between the two
countries.
	   A government spokesman also praised President Clinton for again
recommending renewal of China's normal trading rights, but said the
status should be made permanent instead of subject to annual
review.
	   ``President Clinton made a wise decision'' because the trading
rights benefit the people of both countries, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a briefing.
	   Zhu also said President Jiang Zemin expected to ``exchange views
in an extensive and in-depth manner'' with Clinton during their
June 25 to July 3 China summit.
	   Beijing hopes its critics in Congress will actively work ``to do
something beneficial for the improvement and development of
bilateral relations,'' Zhu said.
	   Some of Clinton's critics in Congress do not want him to receive
China's formal welcome in Tiananmen Square because the Chinese
military on June 4, 1989, violently ended demonstrations that had
been held in the square for six weeks.
	   China routinely holds welcoming ceremonies for visiting
international leaders in front of the Great Hall of the People, on
the edge of the square.
	   Asked if China would switch the site of the welcoming ceremony
for Clinton, Zhu suggested there would be no change.
	   ``China will, according to the protocol China accords to foreign
heads of state paying state visits to China, give President Clinton
a warm and friendly reception,'' he said.
	   The annual renewal of trade privileges has been a persistent
irritant in relations ever since the military crackdown on the 1989
demonstrations. Beijing wants to have low-tariff trade rights,
known as most-favored-nation status, on a permanent basis.
	   ``The annual review of China's most-favored-nation trade status
is not conducive to the development of longterm, stable and normal
economic relations and trade,'' Zhu said. ``We hope the United
States will abandon this outmoded practice as soon as possible.''
	   President Clinton proposed the renewal Wednesday, three days
after members of Congress questioned whether it would pass.
Congressional inquiries are under way examining an alleged Chinese
plot to funnel money to Clinton's Democratic Party and whether
waivers he granted allowing U.S. satellites to be launched in China
resulted in any transfer of sensitive information.
	   Most-favored-nation trade status allows China to sell goods to
the United States under the lowest tariffs. The privilege is
permanently granted to almost all U.S. trading partners, but must
be renewed each year for China.
	   The status expires July 3, and Congress has 60 days after that
to object to the renewal recommendation.

Ukrainian woman kills three after taunts about her sexual
</HEADLINE>
orientation  

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A 26-year-old Ukrainian woman was sentenced
to death after killing a man who flirted with her and two other
people who allegedly teased her for being a lesbian, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Angela Shevchenko, from the village of Lazurny in southern
Ukraine, long suffered ridicule from fellow villagers who disliked
her sexual preferences, Kievskiye Vedomosti said.
	   When a local police lieutenant tried to flirt with her, a
slightly intoxicated Shevchenko took his advances for mockery,
seized the man's pistol and shot him to death, the paper said.
	   Shevchenko then proceeded to shoot two others, telling friends
that ``two bodies will be found in our village tomorrow,'' the
paper reported.
	   Police quickly arrested Shevchenko, and she was sentenced to
death by the Kherson district court. However, she is unlikely to be
executed since Ukraine has imposed a defacto moratorium on capital
punishment following demands from the Council of Europe.
	   The newspaper did not say when exactly Shevchenko was sentenced.

China opposes proposed U.S. sale of F-16 equipment to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China called on the United States Thursday to
block a proposed sale of 28 F-16 fighter jet navigation and
targeting devices to Taiwan.
	   The U.S. military on Tuesday informed Congress it had approved
the sale of the devices. Congress has 30 days to object to the sale
if it wishes.
	   The U.S. government should block the sale to prevent damage to
improving relations between the two countries, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a briefing.
	   ``China stands resolutely opposed to any sale by the United
States of advanced military equipment and technology to Taiwan,''
Zhu said.
	   The United States is violating a 1982 agreement to gradually
reduce arms sales to Taiwan, Zhu said. Military sales to Taiwan
``impair China's sovereignty and security,'' he said.
	   Beijing regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must
eventually be reunited with the mainland.
	   The issue is likely to be on the agenda when President Clinton
visits for a summit later this month. Chinese leaders and foreign
policy analysts say Taiwan is the most important and most sensitive
issue in China's relations with the United States.
	   The prime contractor for the dlrs 160 million sale of the F-16
devices is Lockheed Martin.

Billy Joel cancels concert after asthma attack
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Updates in graf 4 and 6 with reason Elton John will not
perform, and no rescheduling.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Singer Billy Joel, suffering from asthma, canceled
a joint concert with Sir Elton John on Thursday and apologized to
the nearly 30,000 fans who had tickets to the show in Manchester,
northern England.
	   ``I feel terrible about this, not only for my own fans, but for
Elton and his fans as well,'' Joel said.
	   ``To everyone who planned to attend the Manchester show tonight,
I convey my deepest apologies,'' the 49-year-old singer said in the
statement issued Thursday.
	   Elton John would not appear alone in Manchester, the promoters
said. During the concerts, the two stars face each other over their
pianos, swapping comments, and each makes an appearance in the
other's set.
	   At the pair's opening concert in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday,
Joel suffered an acute asthma attack brought on by an upper
respiratory infection. Reviewers had noted bitter winds at the open
air concert.
	   ``This condition has caused the Manchester concert to be
canceled,'' MCP Promotions said, promising a full refund and adding
its apologies. Because of international commitments, the stars
would not be able to reschedule the Manchester concert, MCP said.
	   The two remaining shows in the four-show series would go ahead
as planned in London's Wembley stadium this weekend, the promoters
said.

Philippine peso slips; stocks end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso slipped against
the U.S. dollar Thursday in thin trading, pressured by declines by
the Thai baht, dealers said.
	   Dealers said that while the peso closely tracked the baht's
losses over the session, a heavier decline was prevented by
stability in other regional currencies, investment inflows and the
continued slack demand for dollars from the corporate sector.
	   The dollar averaged 39.098 pesos for the day, up from 38.942
pesos on Wednesday.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said demand for dollars is likely
to remain light as long as the peso trades around 39 pesos to the
dollar.
	   In stock trading, shares ended mixed as bargain-hunters rallied
behind oversold blue-chip issues after nine sessions of declines,
while liquidating their portfolios of second-tier stocks, traders
said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 24.89 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 1,953.88, after losing 17.09 points on
Wednesday.
	   Decliners, however, edged out gainers 45 to 41, while 35 issues
were unchanged.
	   Weighed down by prospects of a recession in the Asian region,
the index had given up a total of 219.62 points, or over 10 percent
of its value, in the previous nine sessions.
	   Traders said investor interest in blue chip stocks gained a
much-needed boost after Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said
American billionaire George Soros may be interested in acquiring
the 45.5 percent government stake in Philippine National Bank,
which is up for privatization.
	   ``That sent a positive signal to the market,'' said Peter Unlay,
analyst for Tower Securities Inc.
	   Philippine National Bank shares closed 2 pesos higher at 71
pesos on the back of Enriquez' statement.
	   Overall, however, the market's performance Thursday was a
``pathetic technical rebound,'' said Ian Kane, trader for
Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   He said the market recovery was largely limited to big capital
stocks such as property developer Ayala Land Inc., conglomerate
Ayala Corp., Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. and power distributor
Manila Electric Co.
	   The rest of the market stumbled during the session and failed to
ride on what earlier appeared to be an across-the-board rally.

Tens of thousands left homeless by Kosovo fighting
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-Albania-Kosovo Refugees, BC-Yugoslavia-Another War?  
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are still hiding in forests hoping to escape,
reports said Thursday.
	   As the refugee exodus continued into neighboring Albania,
officials in that country again pleaded for international
assistance to help deal with the crisis. Upwards of 5,000 people
from Kosovo are believed to have arrived in Albania since last
weekend.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Foreign Minister Fatos Nano said in a
letter to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, theother republic left in what remains of
Yugoslavia besides Serbia, Montenegro's commissioner for refugees
said Thursday. Most are women, children and elderly, Djordje
Scepanovic said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says 40,000 people in Kosovo have fled
their homes in the face of the campaign by Serb forces to crush
militants in Kosovo _ to Albania, Montenegro or elsewhere in
Kosovo.
	   But that figure is growing fast, and others say it is a
conservative estimate. Ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo claim
50,000 have been displaced since the start of an earlier crackdown
in March.
	   Many are still on the run within Kosovo, a Serb-ruled province
where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The Albanian-language daily Bujku reported Thursday said
thousands are headed toward the border with Albania, Europe's
poorest country, which already is feeling the strain of the refugee
crush.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory. Dozens of deaths are reported since an
intensive campaign began last week.
	   With many ethnic Albanian villages in ruins, the Serbs' apparent
strategy of forced expulsions has drawn increasing comparison to
the ethnic cleansing carried out in neighboring Bosnia.
	   ``One does feel like the movie called `Ethnic Cleansing' is
replaying itself,'' U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Wednesday.
	   During the Balkan war that ended in 1995, rival ethnic groups
took dominance over whole areas by driving other ethnic groups from
their homes by the tens of thousands.
	   Western officials are debating whether to send in troops or
impose new sanctions against Yugoslavia. NATO chief Solana said
Wednesday that all options remain open, although the West is openly
reluctant to commit a huge military contingent to the region, with
34,000 troops already in Bosnia.
	   The latest Serb campaign has caused the apparent collapse of
talks that opened last month between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``It is evident violence has escalated to such a point that
negotiations would now be meaningless,'' said Fehmi Agani, member
of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   Serb police turned back Agani and two aides Wednesday from a
road leading into Decani.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross
requested the Serbian authorities to ``immediate and unimpeded
access'' to the area of the fighting in order to carry out
humanitarian work there.
	   Meanwhile, Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian
politician, acknowledged that Rugova has no influence over the
Kosovo Liberation Army which ``does not want to hear of him.''

Recession fears spook Singapore market, drop to Janurary low
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-Asian Markets
  By LAURINDA KEYS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite government assurances the Singapore
economy can avoid recession, a falling currency, rising
unemployment and mounting bad economic news drove the benchmark
stock index on Thursday to its lowest level since mid-January.
	   The Straits Times Industrials Index, which had been dropping for
two weeks, tumbled 32.06 points, or 2.62 percent Thursday. It
pierced the 1200 point floor and reached 1187.74, the lowest point
since the height of the regional economic crisis in mid-January.
	   Trading volume was thin at just over 93 million shares.
	   Singapore had not suffered the financial chaos that its
Southeast Asian neighbors have faced since last year. But as the
regional crisis deepened, Singapore's extensive investment in
weaker neighbor economies and its dependence on trade have started
to take a toll.
	   The Singapore dollar has steadily lost value against the U.S.
currency over the past few weeks. From dlrs 1.6744 to the Singapore
dollar in late Wednesday trading, the U.S. currency moved as high
as dlrs 1.684 on Thursday, before settling back to dlrs 1.6832 as
the Singapore stock market closed.
	   Currency sellers blamed Finance Minister Richard Hu's report to
Parliament on Monday that non-oil domestic exports _ a major
component of Singapore's gross domestic product _ fell by 6 percent
in May, compared to a year earlier.
	   Market participants regard that decline as an indication
Singapore may slide into recession this year. There were reports
that the currency selling began in London.
	   Government leaders have switched from advising Singaporeans to
tighten their belts to predicting all-time high unemployment this
year. Manpower Minister Lee Boon Yang told university graduates
Thursday not to be picky about what job they take.
	   News reports that many recent homebuyers, already fearing wage
hold-downs if not layoffs, will face up to 40 percent jumps in
their mortgage payments seemed to be the final straw for the
already weak property market. The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
Properties Index fell 3.4 percent, or 9.82 points, to 282.54.
	   A big loser was City Developments Ltd., whose stocks lost 5.2
percent of their value on trading volume of 674,000 shares.
	   The mortgage payment jump is based on widespread bargains that
were offered condominium, house and apartment buyers in 1995. Rates
were set low for three years, on the understanding that market
rates would come into force in 1998. Current rates are much higher
than buyers could have imagined three years ago.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military helicopter plunged into a
cloud-covered mountain Thursday in the disputed territory of East
Timor, killing two top commanders and 10 other officers and
soldiers. There were no survivors.
	   The U.S.-made Bell 205 helicopter exploded on impact, military
Lt. Col. Supardi said in a telephone interview from Dili, capital
of the former Portuguese colony. It was raining at the time, and
visibility was poor.
	   ``It was a pure accident,'' Supardi said.
	   Separatist rebels who have been fighting the military for two
decades sometimes clash with soldiers in the area, but there was no
indication that they had shot down the helicopter.
	   The victims included Maj. Gen. Yudomo, who was appointed last
month as military commander for eastern Indonesia, including East
Timor, and Col. Slamet Sidabutar, commander in the territory.
	   Yudomo, who was based in the resort island of Bali, and the
other officers were on an inspection tour when the helicopter
crashed.
	   Army Capt. Muhamad, the military spokesman in Dili, suffered
serious injuries and was rushed to a hospital but he died while
being treated. The helicopter shattered into pieces on impact,
leaving only the tail intact.
	   Hampered by rugged terrain, rescue workers evacuated burned
bodies from the remote site near Viqueque, about 110 miles (180
kilometers) east of Dili. The helicopter went down four minutes
after taking off from the nearby town of Baucau.
	   The city is 1,200 miles (1,920 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   The Indonesian military invaded East Timor in 1975, and has
maintained a heavy presence there ever since. Indonesia declared
the territory its 27th province in 1976, but a small band of
guerrillas who want independence continue to fight.
	   In the Indonesian military's worst air crash, an air force C-130
transport plane crashed minutes after taking off from Halim
military base in Jakarta in October 1991, killing 136 soldiers
aboard. One man survived. The cause remains unknown.
	   In March last year, an Indonesian air force F-16 jet crashed in
bad weather in Jakarta, killing the pilot.

Leek farmers unknowingly sow seeds of winter crop disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch leek farmers have sown the
seeds for a disastrous harvest after a delivery mixup left them
with summer leek seeds instead of the hardier winter variety.
	   Farmers have already sown 400 hectares (988 acres) of the leeks
after a producer mistakenly sold them summer leek seeds, the Dutch
daily Algemeen Dagblad reported Thursday.
	   If temperatures drop below minus 6 degrees C (21 degrees F) this
winter the crop will die, costing the farmers millions of guilders
(dollars) in lost revenues, the report said.

Report: Hong Kong official says China won't devalue yuan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hong Kong's top civil servant gave assurances
Thursday that China will not devalue its currency and that Hong
Kong will keep its currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, a news
report said.
	   ``It is not in China's national interest to devalue,'' Chief
Secretary Anson Chan told reporters in Tokyo, according to Kyodo
News.
	   For the past year, investors have feared that China may be
tempted to devalue its currency, the yuan, to make its exports more
competitive as other Asian currencies continue to skid.
	   Chan also said Hong Kong has not plans to abandon its currency's
dollar-peg.
	   ``We are fully confident the currency board system works
extremely well,'' she reportedly said.

Taiwan forms task force to combat virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Acknowledging it has responded too slowly
to a viral outbreak blamed for the deaths of 29 children, Taiwan's
Cabinet formed a task force Thursday to try to eliminate the
disease.
	   Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said the task force would
coordinate medical resources and manpower to stop spread of
enterovirus 71, which has sickened about 7,500 children.
	   Chen Chi-shean, director-general of the Health Department, said
the scale of the outbreak had caught health authorities off guard.
Besides those who died, about 100 were ill enough to be placed in
intensive care.
	   The virus has struck worst in central Taiwan, where the hot, wet
climate is considered most conducive to its spread. One hospital
alone, Changhua Christian Hospital, has reported nine deaths since
mid-May.
	   Spread by physical contact, the virus breaks down immunity and
can leave infants and toddlers susceptible to encephalitis,
meningitis, and acute inflammation of the heart muscle. Early
symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, headache and
vomiting.
	   Dr. Huang Li-min, an expert on viral diseases at National Taiwan
University Hospital, said the virus is the most virulent of the 67
types of enterovirus to hit Taiwan since 1980.
	   Most enterovirus that hit Taiwan during the summer are
relatively benign, and deaths are unusual, Huang said.
	   Nursery schools in parts of Changhua and Tainan counties were
ordered closed for a week, and schools for very young children in
other parts of central Taiwan were being given the option of
recessing.
	   Parents were advised not to take young children out in public,
and be sure children changed clothes and washed their hands
frequently.

Russia's markets surge, though still far below previous highs
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with bond market rally, new market data; ADDS byline.  
  By MAURA REYNOLDS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial markets rebounded further
Thursday despite the government's insistence that a quick bailout
package was unlikely.
	   Expectation of such emergency aid has buoyed Russia's troubled
markets, which have regained some of the ground they lost last week
when jittery investors began to pull out of Russia.
	   The bond market surged in early trading, with yields on 11-month
treasury bills dropping by 9 percent. The stock market also
rallied, climbing another 2 percent after increases of 12 percent
Tuesday and 8 percent Wednesday.
	   Many analysts have credited the improvement to rumors of new
lending from the International Monetary Fund or others to ease the
government's desperate cash flow problem.
	   But the Kremlin has expressed little enthusiasm for a bailout
package like the ones offered to Asian countries. A Finance
Ministry spokesman insisted late Wednesday that Russia hasn't
requested emergency aid, and will announce a new borrowing program
by early next week.
	   All the same, analysts say some sort of a package is likely
since some Western financial institutions, particularly German
banks, have significant stakes in the Russian market.
	   Meanwhile, Russia is taking its own measures to raise cash,
making a surprise Eurobond offer Thursday to raise dlrs 1.2
billion. That followed a treasury bill auction Wednesday to raise
dlrs 16.5 billion, some of it from rare, one-week treasury bills.
	   Russia's financial crisis began last week with a steep drop in
the stock market that many feared could lead to a run on the ruble
_ which could cause political as well as economic turmoil in the
former superpower.
	   Despite the recent gains, Russian markets remain far below last
year's record highs. The main stock index was 215.17 at midday
Thursday, down 46 percent from last year's close of 396.86.
	   Ten of Russia's most powerful businessmen are developing a joint
plan to address the country's severe economic troubles, which
include a chronic inability to collect taxes, news agencies
reported.
	   The so-called ``oligarchs,'' who head Russia's powerful banking
conglomerates, met late Wednesday with President Boris Yeltsin,
said Vagit Alekperov, president of Russia's largest oil company,
LUKoil.
	   The tycoons' plan will be released in the next few days,
Alekperov said, according to the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies.
	   In a Kremlin meeting earlier this week, Yeltsin had asked them
to set aside their private conflicts and join efforts to get the
Russian economy back on track.

  Israeli dailies publish U.S. peace initiative  
  By GWEN ACKERMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli daily on Thursday published the
complete U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal which would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control and
restrict Jewish settlement expansion.
	   Details of the U.S. initiative have been reported in the past,
but Thursday marked the first time the plan was published in its
entirety.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points of the
initiative as published in the Haaretz daily. However, a spokesman
for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Haaretz had published an
outdated draft.
	   U.S. officials expect a decision from Israel within days on the
plan, and there were indications Thursday that Netanyahu has
softened his initial resistance.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Netanyahu had embraced most of the
proposals, including a 13 percent troop pullback over 12 weeks, and
that the key sticking point now was the scope of an additional
withdrawal. Netanyahu wants to limit that pullback to 2 percent,
but the Palestinians said they expected a more generous offer.
	   ``We will never agree to a 2 percent redeployment,'' Asfour told
The Associated Press. Asfour said that under the American plan, the
scope of the next pullback was to be negotiated at a later time and
not to be included in the current package.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to meet with senior Palestinian
negotiators in London on Thursday to discuss the U.S. plan.
	   Netanyahu briefed President Ezer Weizman on the negotiations
Thursday. Weizman said after the meeting: ``I don't want to say
that it is over yet, but I am more optimistic than in the past.''
	   Israel's three major dailies published details of the American
plan on Thursday _ with the Haaretz account the most comprehensive
_ prompting some speculation about who leaked the document and why.
	   If the Netanyahu government handed the plan to the newspapers,
it might have been a way of testing public opinion. A majority of
Israelis want the prime minister to forge ahead with the peace
process with the Palestinians, but far-right coalition partners
have threatened to bring down his government over a troop pullback.
	   A leak by U.S. officials could have been designed to pressure
Israel into making a decision quickly. The U.S. ambassador to
Israel, Edward Walker, said Wednesday that Israel had days, not
weeks, as suggested by Netanyahu, to make a decision.
	   Under the plan, Israel would withdraw troops in three stages
over 12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control over 3
percent of the West Bank and partial control over another 24
percent. At the end of the pullback, they would have full control
over 18.2 percent and partial control over 22 percent, for a total
of 40 percent _ a possible springboard for statehood.
	   Talks on a permanent peace accord would begin immediately with
the first troop pullback.
	   In the agreement, Israel promises not to expand Jewish
settlements in a significant way, says it will refrain from
demolishing 1,800 Palestinian homes currently slated for
construction and restricts land confiscations.
	   In another nod to the Palestinians, sections of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction will be annulled by vote
of the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather than the much
larger Palestine National Council.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, will not question Israeli credentials
at the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will outlaw
incitement against Israel and systematically confiscate illegal
weapons.
	   A trilateral committee will meet every two weeks to discuss
security matters. An American-Palestinian committee will follow up
on the cases of suspected Palestinian militants. Israel has
complained about a revolving door policy under which Islamic
militants were arrested for show and then quickly released.

Court turns down appeal to rehabilitate Stalin's henchman, Yezhov
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Supreme Court rejected an appeal Thursday
to rehabilitate Nikolai Yezhov, the dreaded chief of Josef Stalin's
secret police who carried out the dictator's Great Terror before he
fell victim to it himself.
	   The appeal was launched by Yezhov's stepdaughter, who urged that
he should be rehabilitated since in the end he was also a victim of
Stalin's purges.
	   However, the court ruled that as one of the architects of the
repressions, Yezhov isn't eligible for rehabilitation under a
Russian law that restores the reputations of victims of terror,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Stalin appointed Yezhov chief of the NKVD secret police in 1936
and had him launch mass purges in which millions of Russians were
executed or perished in prisons or hard-labor camps. Yezhov's own
turn came in 1939 when he was arrested and charged with espionage.
	   He was executed in 1940 and replaced as NKVD chief by Lavrenty
Beria.
	   The court refused to consider prosecutors' proposal that Yezhov
be cleared of espionage charges _ the usual trumped-up charges
leveled against those who were purged.
	   In April, Beria's co-worker Viktor Abakumov, who held different
posts in the state security system until his trial and execution in
1954, was cleared of similar treason charges. Prosecutors are also
considering amending espionage charges against several of Stalin's
other henchmen.

Calypso heads for La Rochelle as museum
</HEADLINE>
  By YVES GAUBERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LA ROCHELLE, France (AP) _ Its name is almost as famous as its
captain, making its last voyage without its master but with a new
mission.
	   After navigating the globe with undersea explorer Jacques
Cousteau, the damaged Calypso was expected to arrive on a barge
Friday in this French Atlantic port to be transformed into a marine
museum.
	   Cousteau's widow Francine, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
La Rochelle's deputy mayor, Michel Crepeau, were to greet the ship,
itself a star of ``The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau'' TV
documentaries.
	   The Cousteau Society was to award Giuliani and Crepeau for their
work toward environmental protection.
	   After sinking in the port of Singapore in January 1996, the ship
was no longer seaworthy. It was loaded on a barge May 28 in
Marseille to make the trip around Spain and up the French coast to
La Rochelle.
	   After arriving Friday, the ship was to be placed in the water
and towed Sunday afternoon into a port in the center of town.
	   New York, Paris and La Rochelle were candidates to adopt the
vessel. But the La Rochelle Maritime Museum was chosen to host the
Calypso, with construction plans for a 5 million-franc (dlrs
830,000) museum.
	   Built in 1942 in Seattle, Washington, the 42-meter (137-foot)
ship was first a minesweeper named the JB.26. Given to Great
Britain, it was sent to Malta and renamed the Calypso. Cousteau
acquired the ship in 1954.
	   Cousteau, who died last June, had been criticized in a recent
report with faking some scenes in his documentaries. But Sir Peter
Blake, the current head of the Cousteau Society, defended him last
month.
	   Cousteau might have been responsible for some indiscretions
because nobody was ``lily white,'' but his aims were ``totally
pure,'' Blake said.
	   Blake also said the allegations could have come from some of
Cousteau's former crew members, who were unhappy with past
treatment.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
Thursday put into high gear their campaign against a South Asian
arms race threatened by Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   A diplomat close to the emergency meeting said China, Britain,
France, Russia and the United States planned to try to ``find a
formula for defusing the tension'' between the two rival countries.
	   ``They see their role as one facilitating a reduction of tension
in the subcontinent and to persuade India and Pakistan to sign up
to the global regime against nuclear proliferation,'' said the
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The meeting's chairman, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
has ruled out joint sanctions against India and Pakistan, but
experts from the five countries have been building a common
position.
	   Tang will try to stop the arms race between China's neighbors,
fearing it could encourage more countries to obtain nuclear
weapons, Chinese officials said in Beijing.
	   ``We should urge them with one voice and make them realize it's
not in their interest,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, in Geneva after
visiting India and Pakistan, told disarmament negotiators from 61
countries Thursday the ``lack of serious intention'' by the five
powers contributed to the arms race.
	   But he said he preferred ``to concentrate on the positive'' and
backed efforts to defuse the tensions between Iran's neighbors.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   The Iranians didn't plan to meet with the five original nuclear
states' ministers, he said.
	   Tang was meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and separately with other top diplomats in preparation for a
hastily arranged joint session later Thursday.
	   Albright was also separately meeting Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
said Albright. ``These two countries are cheek-by-jowl.''
	   As he sent Albright from Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton
promised to work to end the Asian rivals' nuclear competition.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.''
	   In Washington, a top official said that in the Geneva meetings
Thursday, Albright would seek common ground among the five original
nuclear powers.
	   But she wouldn't urge joint sanctions on Pakistan and India as
that could be counterproductive, the official said.
	   ``We want to defuse the current tensions,'' Karl F. Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, told a Senate
hearing.
	   Also attending the meeting at the United Nations' European
headquarters are British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They also are all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India. Neither
India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Inderfurth said the United States was adamant neither India nor
Pakistan would join the club.
	   ``There is no disposition to reward any nation for blasting its
way into that nuclear-state category,'' he said.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan nuclear power status without unraveling the
entire complex treaty negotiated in the late 1960s.
	   They are examining other ways of bringing them into global,
step-by-step disarmament efforts.
	   The meeting will examine all initiatives to aid
non-proliferation and promote regional security, said a spokeswoman
for the French mission in Geneva under condition of anonymity.
	   ``We would like to discuss with our partners a position to put
an end to such experiences,'' a Russian mission spokeswoman said
without commenting further.

Bank chief says Thai economy will be OK if baht falls to 45
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with central bank shrugging off fears baht
could tumble to 45 to the dollar, closing stock prices.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor
claimed Thursday that economic prospects will suffer little even if
the currency slides further amid fears of a worsening regional
recession.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul spoke to reporters as the baht, which had
been stable for several weeks at about 39 to the dollar, weakened
to 42.95 in afternoon trading from 42.20 at Wednesday's close.
	   ``If the baht is traded between 40 baht and 45 baht, our economy
will be able to handle it,'' Chatu Mongkol said. ``It is OK for the
exchange rate to move, as long as it doesn't move too quickly.''
	   The currency has been weakening since last week when Thailand
and the International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a dlrs
17.2 billion bailout of the economy, agreed that the country's
recession would be deeper and longer than previously thought.
	   The economy is now expected to shrink as much as 5.5 percent in
1998, compared to 3.5 percent previously.
	   The baht has lost some 40 percent of its value since it was
floated 11 months ago following a failed defense against currency
speculation. The move triggered a regional economic meltdown.
	   Thai share prices ended 1.8 percent higher Thursday after the
Bank of Thailand announced details of a debt restructuring plan
that will allow banks to set aside smaller reserves, encouraging
talks with borrowers on whittling down problem loans.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed up 5.60 points to
318.81.
	   Worry that the continuing slump will spark a new crisis has
prompted Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda to plan a trip to
the United States, his office said Thursday.
	   Details have yet to be confirmed, but the Bangkok Post reported
Tarrin planned to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus.
	   The report said that Tarrin would seek assurances of assistance
in case Thailand had to face increased obligations due to currency
fluctuations and an outflow of funds.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are still hiding in forests hoping to escape,
reports said Thursday.
	   As the refugee exodus continued into neighboring Albania,
officials in that country again pleaded for international
assistance to help deal with the crisis. Upwards of 5,000 people
from Kosovo are believed to have arrived in Albania since last
weekend.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lives and the peace in Kosovo,'' he said.

Euro nations to launch economic policy council
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: will be UPDATED after meeting starts around 1600 gmt  
  By PAUL AMES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union takes another step toward
making its single currency a reality Thursday when finance
ministers from 11 nations launch a new body to coordinate economic
policy in the euro era.
	   The first so-called ``euro-11'' council will meet in a
Luxembourg suburb and is expected to focus on measures to keep
budget deficits small and government debts falling in the
euro-zone.
	   EU leaders agreed in December to set up the council to tighten
consultations between the 11 nations that will adopt the euro as
their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The decision was reached after months of wrangling among EU
nations. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece _ who are staying out
of the single currency for now _ tried to block the setting up of
the council, fearing it would exclude them from key economic
decisions.
	   Germany was concerned the council _ first suggested by France _
could be used to undermine the independence of the European Central
Bank, which is to run monetary policy after the switch to the euro.
	   As a compromise, the council does not have formal
decision-making powers. But France is expected to try to build it
into an important forum for coordinating polices on taxation,
budgets and other economic issues.
	   France wants the council to become a political counterweight to
the powerful, unelected board of the European Central Bank, based
in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   Ministers from the other EU nations will be invited to attend
some council sessions. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown will briefly attend the opening meeting, since his country
currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
	   But he will turn over the chair to Austrian Finance Minister
Rudolf Edlinger. Austria takes over the presidency from Britain on
July 1.
	   Britain's exclusion left Brown open to criticism from opposition
lawmakers in Britain.
	   ``This is a humiliating position,'' said Graham Mather,
Conservative spokesman on European economics. ``The Labor
government (has) proved incapable of negotiating effectively in the
EU arena.''
	   On Friday, Brown will chair a full session of the 15 EU finance
ministers that will prepare economic issues on the agenda of the
June 15-16 EU summit in Cardiff, Wales.
	   Topics include plans to boost growth and job creation after the
euro's launch and the contentious issue of how much each nation
should contribute to the EU's common budget as the Union takes on
new members in eastern Europe.

Technicians' strike severely disrupts BBC news
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 24-hour technicians' strike Thursday wiped out
dozens of BBC domestic news programs and curtailed some of the
corporation's international World Service broadcasts.
	   The technicians' union said its 7,000 members employed by the
British Broadcasting Corp. walked off the job starting at midnight
(2300 GMT Wednesday) in a dispute over what they view as the
gradual privatization of the BBC.
	   The corporation, funded largely by compulsory license fees, has
undergone huge changes in the past five years as managers seek to
adapt to increasing competition from commercially funded
broadcasters and technological advances.
	   News bulletins on BBC TV morning shows were curtailed, and
virtually uninterrupted classical music replaced the corporation's
flagship current affairs program on Radio 4.
	   The Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theater Union
said that unless the BBC compromises, a strike may black out World
Cup soccer games, which start June 10.
	   The dispute centers on the BBC's plans to transfer its technical
arm to a separate company, BBC Resources Ltd., which would bid to
make programs by other broadcasters on a commercial basis.
	   ``We have asked for a guarantee that they will not try and sell
Resources Ltd. for five to 10 years,'' union spokesman Luke Crawley
told The Associated Press. ``They say they have no plans but won't
give a cast-iron guarantee, which we find suspicious.''
	   The union also wants promises about no layoffs of staff, and
opposes changes of work practices.
	   ``The future of broadcasting demands flexibility,'' BBC
personnel director Margaret Salmon said. ``What we are proposing is
what any well-run successful organization would do.''
	   More talks were scheduled Friday.
	   Since BBC Director General John Birt took over in 1993, he has
slimmed down the 25,000-member payroll, separated in-house
production from the hiring of freelance crews, integrated news
gathering for TV and most of radio, and tried to boost the BBC's
commercial sales.

General Motors changes production plans for Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The opening of a General Motors
assembly plant in eastern Thailand will be delayed until the first
half of the year 2000 because East Asia's economic crisis has
forced the company to reconsider what model to produce, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
	   Initial production at the plant in Rayong province is still
expected to be 40,000 vehicles per year as originally planned, said
Kantanit Sukonthasap, vice president for corporate affairs of
General Motors (Thailand).
	   Kantanit said the company did not want to reveal yet which model
it now intends to produce, in order not to lose any advantage in
preparing marketing plans.
	   ``What will be produced would have to be, under current
circumstances, the product with the most value for money,'' he
said, adding that about 80 percent of production was earmarked for
export.
	   Construction of GM's Rayong factory building, begun in late
1996, is expected to be finished as scheduled by the end of this
year, he said.
	   But machinery installation was put on hold after the economic
crunch forced a reevaluation, he said. The local market for
automobiles had fallen 70 percent since the crisis began last year,
Kantanit said.
	   ``We have always stressed being committed to Thailand,'' he
said. ``As the economy collapsed, in the region as well as in
Thailand, we had to go back and look at production and marketing
plans to look for a more suitable product, and that took some
time.''
	   He did not say which model GM had originally hope to assemble,
for what had been a scheduled mid-1999 roll-out.
	   The plant will have an initial full operating capacity of 100,00
vehicles a year, and 1,500 people are expected to be employed on
the shop floor, Kantanit said.
	   He gave the amount of GM's investment as ``not exceeding dlrs
500 million.''

Bus drivers in Indonesian capital go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stranding passengers, hundreds of bus
drivers in Jakarta went on strike Thursday to protest against
corruption and demand higher salaries.
	   The drivers have long complained about corruption in the state
Jakarta Transportation Company. Emboldened by democratic reforms in
the wake of the ouster of President Suharto last month, they again
pressed their demands for an overhaul of company management.
	   A company official, I Made Gede, said bus drivers had pledged to
restart service Friday after the management promised them a 15
percent salary increase.
	   The purchasing power of salaries has been shrinking as Indonesia
suffers its worst economic crisis in decades. The rupiah has lost
more than 70 percent of its value since last year and prices of
basic commodities are soaring.

Thursday rushed to join an emergency meeting of the world's
official nuclear powers, characterizes the South Asian arms race as
``uniquely dangerous.''
	   Albright, who arrived from Washington Thursday morning, said she
and the foreign ministers of Russia, China, France and Britain were
prepared to unite behind the common goal of defusing nuclear
tension on the Asian subcontinent.
	   Carrying instructions from President Clinton, Albright also was
intent on reviving the global arms control agenda sent staggering
by last month's atomic tests in India and Pakistan.
	   While nuclear weapons have been around since 1945, the actions
of Pakistan and India mark the first time that the long-time
rivals, who share a common border, have escalated their potential
for conflict to the nuclear level, Albright said.
	   ``These two countries are check-by-jowl,'' Albright told
reporters at the State Department on Wednesday shortly before
departing for Switzerland. ``So that creates a uniquely dangerous
situation.''
	   First on the agenda of the meeting at U.N. headquarters in
Geneva was reducing that tension. The U.S. delegation planned to
raise a range of proposals, from convincing India and Pakistan to
refrain from further nuclear tests to the possibility of
international mediation over the disputed Kashmir region.
	   ``Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to
cool it and take a deep breath and begin to climb out of the hole
they have dug themselves into,'' Albright said.
	   Albright met with the meeting's chairman Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and also separately with Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov early Thursday in preparation of the hastily
arranged joint session.
	   Just what leverage the five nuclear nations have to induce
Pakistan and India to cooperate was unclear going into the meeting.
	   U.S. officials were frank in acknowledging that sanctions, or
the threat of sanctions, failed to prevent India and Pakistan from
testing their weapons.
	   At the same time, the Clinton administration is no mood to offer
incentives or rewards to two countries that have thrown the arms
control and counter-proliferation agenda into disarray.
	   ``It would be highly ironic and unacceptable if we were to
provide to those who have broken the rules some benefits that do
not accrue to those who have willingly given it up,'' Albright said
in Washington.
	   She was referring to South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakstan,
Brazil and Argentina _ countries that have renounced their nuclear
weapons programs.
	   Albright laid out three goals for the five powers to pursue:
	   _Convince India and Pakistan to refrain from further testing,
from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and from further
inflammatory rhetoric.
	   _Avert a regional arms race in south Asia and ease territorial
tension over Kashmir.
	   _Convince both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and agree to a proposed treaty that would ban the production
of ``fissile materials'' _ plutonium and highly enriched uranium _
needed to make nuclear weapons.

Kashmir called source of newly nuclear India-Pakistan rivalry

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An international meeting Thursday on
India's nuclear rivalry with Pakistan likely means that the world's
original nuclear powers will address the main dispute between the
two countries: Kashmir.
	   The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways
to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race. India and
Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both
are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
	   No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three
times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing
Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of
Economics' Asia Research Center.
	   One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by
officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both
countries claim.
	   ``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I
think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain
said.
	   Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be
addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists
it remain a bilateral issue. Now, Hussain said, India fears the
Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
	   India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while
Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting
Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
rejected the possibility of international mediation. Vajpayee
repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
	   Indian foreign ministry officials have refused comment on the
Geneva talks, saying they will respond only to specific
recommendations made by the five foreign secretaries, meeting as
the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council at the European
headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory shut
down shops and cleared streets of traffic with a general strike in
the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state Thursday to coincide
with the Geneva meeting, saying they believe the world was now
paying attention to their protests.
	   ``Unless the issue (of Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of
the people under international principles, peace will not return to
the Indian subcontinent,'' said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All
Parties Hurriet Conference called the strike in Srinagar city. The
conference is a coalition of parties who want Indian-held Kashmir
to break away from India either to form an independent country or
join Pakistan.
	   India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training
anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only
moral support.

Albania seeks humanitarian aid to cope with refugees

  With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo  

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Unable to cope with the flood of refugees
from embattled Kosovo, Albania's government has asked NATO for
humanitarian aid, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter sent to
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana late Wednesday and released
Thursday.
	   Nano urged that NATO undertake humanitarian operations in the
impoverished northern area where the refugees are staying,
assisting them with medicines and food.
	   About 5,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from the Serb offensive in
secessionist Kosovo have registered on their arrival in Albania,
according to local officials at the border. But the actual number
is believed to be considerably higher due to those who decline to
register.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano stressed.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lifes and the peace in Kosovo,'' he told Solana.
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the border town where most have arrived.

  Hezbollah says it would barter Israeli airman, if it held him  

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of the militant Hezbollah says
a downed airman who is Israel's most sought POW disappeared in the
late 1980s during an Israeli attack in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
	   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said his group had unsuccessfully tried
to find navigator Ron Arad, seeing in him an important bargaining
chip to get back Lebanese prisoners held by Israel.
	   ``If I had Arad, I would have bargained him to secure the
freedom of the largest number of prisoners,'' Nasrallah said in an
interview late Wednesday on the private Murr TV station.
	   Hezbollah is now negotiating with Israel for an exchange of
Lebanese prisoners for body parts of Israeli soldiers from a
botched commando operation in September. The guerrilla group is
leading the fight to drive Israeli soldiers out of southern
Lebanon.
	   Nasrallah said Hezbollah had not offered a financial reward for
information on Arad's whereabouts, but ``we are ready to do it if
it can help locate the man.''
	   Arad was captured by guerrillas of the pro-Syrian Amal, a rival
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, after his plane was shot down
during an air raid over southern Lebanon.
	   Press reports have alleged that Amal's security chief, Mustafa
Dirani, sold the pilot to pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Dirani
broke away from Amal and formed a guerrilla faction called
Believers' Resistance.
	   In 1994, Israeli commandos kidnapped Dirani from his home in
eastern Lebanon in order to question him about the fate of Arad. He
remains in detention in Israel.
	   Nasrallah told the television that Arad was held by the
Believers' Resistance at a secret location until 1988 or 1989 when
Israeli troops mounted an attack in the southern Bekaa Valley.
	   ``The guards on duty at the location where Arad was held left
the place at the time (of the attack) and returned 10 hours later,
but did not find the man,'' he said.
	   ``Since then, the man disappeared and has become a mystery. We
mounted a manhunt for him, but without luck,'' Nasrallah said.
	   Nasrallah denied reports that Iran or Syria, which stations
about 30,000 troops in Lebanon, was holding the pilot.
	   ``Any group that holds Arad can achieve the freedom of the
largest possible number of prisoners,'' he said. ``Both Iran and
Syria are concerned with the resistance and the issue of (Lebanese)
prisoners.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The world's first digital signing of an
international government document was completed Thursday, although
it took several days for officials of Canada, Singapore and the
U.S. state of Pennsylvania to sign on-line.
	   The document was a memorandum of understanding, creating the
Global Learning Consortium, which will serve as the hub for a
network of students, educators and reseachers.
	   Earlier this week, Canada's Industry Minister John Manley and
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge used personalized computer keys to
digitally sign the memorandum in their offices, according to a
statement from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.
	   During a meeting of APEC telecommunications and information
ministers, Singapore's communications minister, Mah Bow Tan, added
his digital signature to the document on Thursday.

New probe begins into plane crash that killed Mozambican President
</HEADLINE>
Machel  

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission began a secret hearing Thursday into the suspicious 1986
air crash that killed Mozambican President Samora Machel.
	   A 1987 inquiry into the crash that killed 34 people concluded
pilot error caused the Russian-made Tupelov plane, which had been
travelling from Malawi to Mozambique, to crash into a hill in
eastern South Africa.
	   But Russian experts who helped with a subsequent investigation
concluded the plane had flown into the hill while following a decoy
signal, thinking it was transmitted from the airpoprt in Maputo,
Mozambique.
	   South Africa's then-apartheid government denied it used false
signals from navigational beacons to lure the plane off course. An
International Civil Aviation Organization team said there was
nothing mysterious or sinister about the accident.
	   But, reviving the controversy, Truth Commission spokesman Vuyani
Green said evidence links activities of the apartheid-era South
African Defence Force to the crash. He did not elaborate.
	   The new probe was being held behind closed doors and journalists
were barred from observing it.
	   The Truth Commission is investigating apartheid-era atrocities,
and can give amnesty to those who fully confess to human rights
abuses.
	   Suspicion that the South African government was involved in the
crash was high at the time because the apartheid regime had tried
to destabilize Machel's government in neighboring Mozambique.
	   Current South African President Nelson Mandela, who is
romantically involved with Machel's widow Graca, has vowed to find
the truth about Machel's death.
	   Witnesses in the current probe reportedly include former South
African military intelligence members. They were not being
identified because of fears for their safety, Truth Commission
officials said.

U.S. raises rewards for big drug traffickers to dlrs 2 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United States offered rewards of
dlrs 2 million each Thursday for information leading to the arrests
of four important drug traffickers linked to notorious opium
warlord Khun Sa.
	   The individual rewards equal one already offered for Khun Sa,
who surrendered to the military government in neighboring Myanmar
in 1996 after fighting a 20-year insurgency financed by heroin
profits.
	   Myanmar authorities have refused U.S. requests to extradite Khun
Sa for trial on a 10-count indictment for heroin trafficking handed
down by a U.S. District Court in New York.
	   For decades, Khun Sa was one of the biggest drug lords in the
Golden Triangle, the mountainous opium cultivation area where the
borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand converge. The bulk of the
heroin reaching the United States comes from there.
	   U.S. officials identified the other four traffickers for whom
maximum rewards of dlrs 2 million each were offered Thursday as:
	   _Liu Szu-po, alias Damrat Namsuwakhon and Lamdap Namsuwakhon, a
Thai national. He was allegedly the principle heroin distributor
for Khun Sa and now an operator of several refineries along the
Thai-Myanmar border.
	   _Chang Ping-yun, alias Khun Sa-eng, a Myanmar national and a
former commander in Khun Sa's army. He is believed to be living in
the Myanmar capital, Yangon, under government protection.
	   _Yang Wan-hsuan, alias Lao Tai, a Chinese national and former
close aide to Khun Sa. The U.S. government said he has detailed
knowledge of Khun Sa's investments and financial activities.
	   _Wei Hsueh-kang, alias Prasit Chivinnitipanya, a Chinese
national and a commander of the United Wa State Army, an armed
ethnic group in Myanmar that finances military activities through
trafficking narcotics.
	   Myanmar authorities say there is no valid treaty with the United
States to extradite Khun Sa, who is believed to be residing in a
military safe house in Yangon under the deal that led to his
surrender.
	   Khun Sa, 62, whose real name is Chang Chi Fu, is the former head
of the Mong Tai Army, a rebel army of 10,000 ethnic Shan who
battled the military regime for self-rule.
	   Since Khun Sa's surrender, the ethnic Wa are believed to have
become the dominant heroin trafficking group and have also turned
to mass amphetamine production.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli daily on Thursday published the
complete U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal which would

but Thursday marked the first time the plan was published in its
entirety.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points of the

Albright sees South Asian arms race as `uniquely dangerous'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
attending an an emergency meeting Thursday of the world's official
nuclear powers, characterizes the South Asian arms race as
``uniquely dangerous.''
	   Albright, who arrived from Washington on Thursday morning, said
she and the foreign ministers of Russia, China, France and Britain
were prepared to unite behind the common goal of defusing nuclear
tension on the Asian subcontinent.
	   Carrying instructions from U.S. President Bill Clinton, Albright
also was intent on reviving the global arms control agenda sent
staggering by last month's atomic tests in India and Pakistan.
	   While nuclear weapons have been around since 1945, the actions
of Pakistan and India mark the first time that the long-time
rivals, who share a common border, have escalated their potential
for conflict to the nuclear level, Albright said.
	   ``These two countries are check-by-jowl,'' Albright said in
Washington on Wednesday before departing for Switzerland. ``So that
creates a uniquely dangerous situation.''
	   First on the agenda Thursday in Geneva was reducing that
tension. The U.S. delegation planned to raise a range of proposals,
from convincing India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear
tests to the possibility of international mediation over the
disputed Kashmir region.
	   ``Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to
cool it and take a deep breath and begin to climb out of the hole
they have dug themselves into,'' Albright said.
	   Albright met with the meeting's chairman Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and also separately with Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov early Thursday in preparation of the hastily
arranged joint session.
	   Just what leverage the five nuclear nations have to induce
Pakistan and India to cooperate was unclear going into the meeting.
	   U.S. officials were frank in acknowledging that sanctions, or
the threat of sanctions, failed to prevent India and Pakistan from
testing their weapons.
	   At the same time, the Clinton administration is no mood to offer
incentives or rewards to two countries that have thrown the arms
control and counter-proliferation agenda into disarray.
	   ``It would be highly ironic and unacceptable if we were to
provide to those who have broken the rules some benefits that do
not accrue to those who have willingly given it up,'' Albright said
in Washington.
	   She was referring to South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakstan,
Brazil and Argentina _ countries that have renounced their nuclear
weapons programs.
	   Albright laid out three goals for the five powers to pursue:
	   _Convince India and Pakistan to refrain from further testing,
from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and from further
inflammatory rhetoric.
	   _Avert a regional arms race in south Asia and ease territorial
tension over Kashmir.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, fresh
from a visit to India and Pakistan, said Thursday that it is
crucial how the original nuclear powers react to the new South
Asian arms race.
	   ``I think that pressure and sanctions are not going to be
helpful,'' Kharrazi told reporters hours before foreign ministers
of the nuclear powers were convening an emergency meeting, also in
Geneva, on India and Pakistan.
	   ``Concentrate on the positive,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Kharrazi said he believes bilateral talks between India and
Pakistan on security, nuclear issues and the disputed region of
Jammu and Kashmir would be a useful first step toward.
	   The United States is the only country among the five that has
imposed sanctions on both countries in response to the their
nuclear arms tests.
	   Sanctions wouldn't force either country to back down and no such
action could ``undo what has been done,'' said Kharrazi.
	   Last Monday in Islamabad Kharrazi praised Pakistan's development
of an ``Islamic bomb'' as the Muslim world's first defense against
Israel's widely suspected nuclear arsenal.
	   ``The terminology of the `Islamic bomb' is meaningless,''
Kharrazi said Thursday. ``Islam has thoughts, and thoughts are not
exploding but spreading.''
	   In a speech Thursday to the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament he said, ``This was one genie that was much better to
have stayed confined in a bottle.''
	   ``The nuclear capability of India and Pakistan has never been a
complete secret,'' Kharrazi said. ``It is a giant mistake to
manifest it.''
	   Kharrazi appeared to endorse some of the goals expressed by
officials of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States
for their meeting later Thursday in Geneva.
	   Kharrazi said it is ``very critical'' how the five powers react.
	   Removing restrictions on access to nuclear material for peaceful
means could be the key to persuading India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said.
	   The five bear partial responsibility for the crisis because of
``the insufficiency and insignificance of the response to demands
for genuine moves on nuclear disarmament,'' Kharrazi added.
	   If they are to be ``neutral and helpful in the cause of
nonproliferation,'' the five nuclear powers should address Israel's
nuclear capability, Kharrazi said.
	   Kharrazi restated Iran's insistence that is has no nuclear
weapons program.
	   On Kashmir, an issue that has dogged relations between the two
countries for 50 years, Kharrazi said ``my understanding is that
they are prepared to engage in such a dialogue.''
	   He added that there has been no progress toward detente between
Tehran and Washington, due to the continuing ``hostile attitude''
of the United States.
	   ``The wall of non-confidence still is there,'' he said.

Asian markets fall on more domestic bad news, Hong Kong woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets continued to lose ground
Thursday, dragged down by more bad economic news at home and
continued concern about Hong Kong's troubled economy.
	   The key indices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia
plunged. Indonesia's shares rallied as foreign investors made a
cautious return.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index sank 3 percent to
close at 8,558, one day after breaking a seven-session losing
streak. The index had plunged more than 10 percent before
Wednesday.
	   Traders said the government's job-creation plan announced
Wednesday, and a previous economic stimulus plan announced last
Friday, failed to impress investors.
	   On Wednesday, the government unveiled a program to create
100,000 jobs over the next 18 months. Hong Kong is suffering from
its highest unemployment in 14 years, and the government announced
on Friday that the economy contracted 2 percent in the first
quarter of the year.
	   In Singapore, fears of a looming recession, official predictions
of growing unemployment, and a falling Singapore dollar also sent
shares down, with the key Strait Times Industrials Index plunging
to its lowest level since mid-January.
	   After a week of falling steadily, the index tumbled 32.06
points, or 2.62 percent, crashing through the 1,200-point floor to
reach 1,187.74.
	   In Taipei, the technology-heavy Weighted Price Index also
plunged 2.84 percent to a four-and-a-half-month low, closing at
7,425.96, as investors worried that the global technology
industry's current doldrums could affect May sales results.
	   Rumors that analysts in the United States may lower estimates of
second-quarter profits for Intel triggered panic-selling on the
Taipei bourse, traders said.
	   Weaknesses in the bourses in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore and
a weak ringgit also soured sentiment in Malaysia, as the key
Composite Index plunged 1.5 percent to 518.61.
	   The Malaysian economy shrank by 1.8 percent year-on-year in the
first quarter of the year, compared with 6.9 percent growth the
previous quarter.
	   In Indonesia, share prices closed sharply higher, boosted by
news that Indonesian debtors and international creditors had struck
an agreement over Indonesia's massive corporate debt overhang.
	   The JSX Composite index closed up 13.723 points, or 3.5 percent,
at 406.331.
	   In Bangkok, share prices also rose, with the benchmark index
gaining 1.8 percent, after the central bank announced details of a
debt restructuring plan for the private sector that will allow
commercial banks to set aside smaller amounts of reserves, dealers
said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 5.60 points to 318.81.
	   In Tokyo, stock prices bounced back modestly, with afternoon
selling sparked by a fall on Hong Kong stock prices eating up some
of its early gains.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 79.47 points,
or 0.52 percent, closing at 15,426.47 points. On Wednesday, the
index had lost 1.33 percent.
	   The dollar edged up slightly against the dollar.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 138.16 yen, up 0.40 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
138.75 yen overnight.
	   The markets in South Korea were closed for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended mixed as bargain-hunters rallied
behind oversold blue-chip issues after nine sessions of declines,
while at the same time liquidating their portfolio of second-line
stocks, traders said.
	   The key index closed 1.3 percent higher at 1953.88.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed slightly lower in thin and
mostly directionless trading, as institutions left the stock market
to retail investors.
	   However, the market held up well given a drop on Wall Street and
mixed markets in Asia, along with a dearth of local corporate news,
brokers said.
	   The key index dropped 3.6 points to 2,658.4.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed lower for the sixth
consecutive day, but buying in market giant Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand to capture its upcoming quarterly dividend payment helped
claw back the market's early losses.
	   The key index fell 3.14 points to 2,152.04.

Taiwan calls on China to institute reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan urged China on Thursday to
institute political reforms as a guarantee against a repeat of its
bloody crackdown on democracy activists nine years ago.
	   Chang King-yu, chairman of the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs
Council, said China badly needs to strengthen rule of law to avoid
a similar tragedy.
	   ``What the mainland really needs now are wide-ranging reforms in
the political system to accompany the current gradual establishment
of new economic, political, social and military systems,'' Chang
said in a speech to the Rotary Club.
	   ``Though June 4 was nine years ago, the mainland's political
climate has yet to undergo any fundamental changes, and human
rights and rule of law have yet to make any significant strides,''
Chang said.
	   Chang, whose agency guides Taiwan's China policy, was speaking
on the anniversary of the clearing of democracy activists from
Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which hundreds, maybe
thousands, died. China's Communist Party declared the movement a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
	   Taiwan's government rarely comments on the Tiananmen incident,
and society here is ambivalent towards the Chinese democracy
movement.
	   Taiwan divided politically from China in 1949, and was ruled as
a one-party state until the advent of full democracy over the past
decade.

Tens of thousands left homeless by Kosovo fighting
</HEADLINE>
  With Albania-Kosovo Refugees, Yugoslavia-Another War?  
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are hiding in forests hoping to escape, reports
said Thursday.
	   Thousands of refugees have flooded into neighboring Albania,
where officials again pleaded for international assistance to help
deal with the crisis. Upwards of 5,000 people from Kosovo are
believed to have arrived in Albania since the weekend.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lives and the peace in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia,
Montenegro's commissioner for refugees said Thursday. Most are
women, children and elderly, Djordje Scepanovic said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says 40,000 people in Kosovo have fled
their homes in the face of the campaign by Serb forces to crush
militants in Kosovo. The 40,000 have fled to Albania, Montenegro or
elsewhere in Kosovo.
	   But that figure is growing fast, and others say it is a
conservative estimate. Ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo claim
50,000 have been displaced since the start of an earlier crackdown
in March.
	   Many are still on the run within Kosovo, a Serb-ruled province
where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The Albanian-language daily Bujku reported Thursday said
thousands are headed toward the border with Albania, Europe's
poorest country, which already is feeling the strain of the refugee
crush.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory. Dozens of deaths are reported since an
intensive campaign began last week.
	   Western officials are debating whether to send in troops or
impose new sanctions against Yugoslavia. NATO chief Solana said
Wednesday that all options remain open, although the West is openly
reluctant to commit a huge military contingent to the region, with
34,000 troops already in Bosnia.
	   The latest Serb campaign has caused the apparent collapse of
talks that opened last month between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``It is evident violence has escalated to such a point that
negotiations would now be meaningless,'' said Fehmi Agani, member
of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team.

Dissidents, disgraced reformer watched on Tiananmen anniversary

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police moved to silence a senior Communist Party
insider purged after the 1989 democracy demonstrations as mourners
discreetly came to Tiananmen Square Thursday to remember the
military's crushing of the student-led movement nine years ago.
	   Bao Tong, who spent nearly eight years in custody as the highest
level party member jailed in the crackdown, said Thursday he had
been told not to speak to foreign reporters. The police order
effectively reimposes a condition of his recently ended probation.
	   About two dozen dissidents have been rounded up nationwide to
prevent commemorations of the protests and the military assault
that ended them on June 4, 1989. Hundreds if not thousands were
killed in Beijing and thousands more arrested around the country.
	   Chinese leaders have feared ever since that the anniversary will
be used to rally opposition to their rule. President Bill Clinton's
visit to China in late June and fears of unrest among millions of
laid-off state industrial workers have added to those concerns.
	   Police quickly pounced on two men, one in a wheelchair, who
threw leaflets in the air near the Monument to the People's Heroes
at the heart of the vast square.
	   Although their protest appeared unrelated to the anniversary _
the leaflets demanded compensation for a shooting accident _ the
police reaction shows how sensitive the bloody end to the popular
protest movement remains nine years on.
	   A group of five young men who as college students participated
in the 1989 protests came to the square, as they have every year,
to commemorate the killings. One wore white, the traditional color
of mourning.
	   The five kept their memorial discreet, standing quietly in the
square amidst the usual clumps of tourists. But they denounced
Clinton's China policy and his decision to come to Beijing.
	   ``We won't welcome President Clinton to China. He's got his
human rights and economic policies mixed up,'' said the young man
dressed in white.
	   Police and soldiers maintained an obvious presence in the
square. Soldiers drilled with Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles
near the Great Hall of the People off the square's western fringe.
Plainclothes police held two-way radios as they patrolled.
	   The leadership also has tightened the house arrest of former
party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a liberal reformer who
sympathized with the 1989 protests, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported
Thursday.
	   Zhao's occasional morning walks and visits to friends may not be
done without permission of the party Central Committee, the group
said.
	   Bao Tong, a top aide to Zhao, was arrested May 28, 1989,
apparently for leaking word that party conservatives planned to
crush the protests.
	   After serving a seven year jail sentence and another 11 months
detained at a guest house, he returned home in April 1997. His
probation ended in the past week or so and his family let foreign
reporters know he wanted to speak out.
	   ``My goal is to be a very good Chinese citizen, a Chinese
citizen with the right to speak his mind,'' The Washington Post
quoted Bao as saying. ``I believe my freedom of speech will be
protected by law and by the government.''
	   A day after the article was published, Bao said he had been told
such interviews were forbidden under rules _ enforced arbitrarily _
that require foreign reporters to get official permission for all
reporting activities.
	   ``I am extremely, extremely sorry. Although under Chinese law I
am supposed to have freedom of speech and I am very willing to
express myself frankly, I am not willing to see you have any
trouble,'' Bao said in a telephone interview Thursday.
	   Bao told the newspapers he believed the Communist Party should
enact democratic reforms that would make it more accountable to the
people and help prevent instability.

Estonia ran aground in thick fog Thursday morning amid the islands
dotting the entrance to Helsinki's main passenger harbor.
	   There were no injuries reported and all passengers were
evacuated by midday.
	   The Laura, owned by the Estonian Linda Line, had set out for
Tallinn, Estonia, when it hit rocks near the Suomenlinna islands,
about one kilometer (1,100 yards) from shore.
	   ``No one is in any danger,'' said Janne Leini, from the Gulf of

Suomenlinna fortress.

Report: Jospin lifts defense secrecy on Elysee wiretap case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has waived defense
secrecy restrictions on a probe of wiretapping practices under the
late President Francois Mitterrand, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The case has raised questions about the power of the presidency,
after investigators reportedly found Mitterrand and his aides
ordered the surveillance of 46 people, including journalists and
entertainers.
	   In a letter Wednesday to investigative Judge Jean-Paul Valat,
Jospin said he ``decided to lift defense secrecy'' on the case
involving surveillance between Jan 1 1983 and March 20, 1986, the
respected daily Le Monde reported.
	   Valat had complained in a letter that Jospin had not responded
to his request since the Socialist prime minister came to power in
June last year. Jospin had supported lifting defense secrecy but
was attacked by some Mitterrand faithful in the party who defended
the president's actions.
	   Jospin's response was expected to recharge the investigation,
stymied by ex-Mitterrand aides who cited defense secrecy to avoid
answering questions by the judge.
	   So far, only Gille Menage, a former chief of staff of
Mitterrand, has been placed under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged _ for complicity in invasion of privacy.''
	   Menage waived defense secrecy protection and told Valat in April
1997 that the presidential Elysee Palace ordered the wiretaps.
	   The testimony came two months after investigators found trunks
of related documents in the garage of former Mitterrand aide
Christian Prouteau.
	   Evidence from the probe indicated the Socialist president was
personally responsible for wiretaps on journalists investigating
the 1985 sinking of a Greenpeace ship and the existence of his
illegitimate daughter.
	   Mitterrand's handwriting was reportedly on seized documents in
the affair, which he signed ``seen.''
	   Actress Carole Bouquet also had her phone tapped, although there
has been no apparent political explanation to date, said Le Monde.
	   A poll last year indicated 92 percent of the French felt the
wiretapping affair was a serious, or very serious, threat to
democracy.

Soldiers suspected in weapons heists appear in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Two South African soldiers
wearing ski masks appeared in court Thursday in connection with
recent thefts of military weapons and ammunition.
	   Police warned journalists their cameras would be confiscated if
they attempted to film or photograph the suspects, who allegedly
have right-wing connections.
	   Their identities of the men, who were arrested Wednesday,
weren't immediately disclosed. They are suspected of being involved
in the theft Monday of 200,000 rounds of ammunition while it was
being transported in a truck from the Tempe Military Base near this
central city. The body of one of the drivers was later found, and
the other is still missing.
	   The suspects were also believed to have been involved in the
theft last month of 117 weapons, including mortars and rocket
launchers, from the 44 Parachute Brigade at the same base. Most of
the weapons have been recovered, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate indication whether the thefts were linked
to any plans to destabilize the country ahead of next year's
national elections.

Malaysia announces company to mop up bad debts
</HEADLINE>
  By ALVIN UNG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia revealed Thursday the
framework of a new bad-loans agency which has been given the
Herculean task of reviving the nation's sagging economy.
	   Known as the Asset Management Company, this government-backed
agency will sponge up bad debt accrued by banks, said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The banks would then have greater flexibility to lend to more
viable businesses in the economy, he said.
	   Anwar also assured the markets that the new agency, which will
need an estimated 25 billion ringgit (dlrs 6.4 billion) to buy up
the loans, will be independent, transparent, ``market-driven'' and
financed by a mix of bond issues and funds from the private sector.
	   ``The agency will operate within guidelines, which meet
international best practices (regarding) all aspects of its
existence,'' Anwar told reporters.
	   The markets responded warily. Moments after he made the
announcement, Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, fell against the
U.S. dollar. Late Thursday, the ringgit was trading between 3.93
and 3.96.
	   Although market observers said the government move was in line
with positive reforms for the financial system, they noted that
most investors were waiting for the moment when the company starts
its operations at the end of July.
	   To raise funds for the asset management company, Anwar said the
government plans to sell foreign bonds worth up to dlrs 2 billion
as well as provide the company a grant of 50 million ringgit (dlrs
12.8 million).
	   Additional funds, amounting to 6 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.5
billion), would be raised in the local bond market. JP Morgan and
Arthur Andersen and Co. have been appointed as financial advisers
to oversee the running of the company.
	   Although the actual mechanism of the asset management company
has yet to be firmly set, Anwar said the agency would take on a
wide range of non-viable assets.
	   Meanwhile, Azman Yahya, the company's appointed chief executive
officer stressed that the new agency isn't a bailout for banks.
	   ``We'll look at assets rather than at banks. We're not a charity
for banks.''
	   Since the Asian economic crisis swept through Malaysia last
July, its currency has plunged more than 35 percent against the
dollar.
	   Economists expect non-performing loans in the banking industry
to swell to at least 20 percent by next year.

U.S. official says Meles prepared to accept peace proposal
</HEADLINE>
  By ABEBE ANDUALEM  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A senior U.S. official trying to
negotiate a peaceful settlement to a border dispute between
Ethiopia and Eritrea said Thursday Ethiopia would be prepared to
accept a joint U.S.-Rwandan proposal to defuse the conflict.
	   ``Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has indicated to me that he would
be prepared to accept the proposal after consulting his
government,'' Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Susan Rice told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said the United States was ``gravely concerned'' that neither
country had agreed on principles outlined to them for a settlement.
	   Rice, who arrived in Ethiopia last weekend for the second round
of mediation, said she could not say when or whether she would
travel to Eritrea because ``things happen so fast.''
	   In the daily briefing Wednesday, Rubin made public for the first
time details of the agreement which calls for Eritrean withdrawal
from the border town of Badme to positions held before May 6, a
complete demilitarization of the disputed zone and the deployment
of a small observer team.
	   Eritrea, which has continued to send troops to border areas, has
insisted that it is not occupying any Ethiopian territory and
claims that its troops are on Eritrean land as determined by
colonial boundaries traced by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in
1885.
	   The U.S.-Rwandan proposal calls on both parties to ``swift and
binding'' delimitation of their border in accordance with
``established colonial treaties and internatinal law applicable to
such treaties.''
	   Eritrea accused Ethiopia of using tanks and heavy artillery in
an attack Wednesday on the frontier village of Ambesete Geleba, 140
kilometers (87 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Ethiopia of
provoking ``a new and dangerous escalation'' of the border crisis,
and said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on
Eritrean positions.
	   Hours later, Ethiopia accused Eritrean troops of attacking near
Aiga and Alitena, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) on the Ethiopian
side of a natural border formed by the Mereb River.
	   Ethiopia also claims Eritrea illegally occupies a 415-sq.
kilometer (166-sq.mile) area known as the Yirga triangle in
northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half dozen smaller areas along the
border.
	   Meles and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki were erstwhile
allies as rebel leaders who succeeded in ousting the 17-year
military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam from Ethiopia in July
1991.
	   Eritrea had been fighting a 30-year war for independence from
Ethiopia. Afwerki negotiated self-rule, followed by formal
independence in 1993.

Albania seeks humanitarian aid to cope with refugees

  Eds: UPDATES with Interior Ministry saying 12,000 Kosovo refugees
in Albania now  
  With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Unable to cope with the estimated 12,000
refugees who have arrived so far from embattled Kosovo, Albania's
government has asked NATO for humanitarian aid, a spokesman said
Thursday.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter sent to
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana late Wednesday and released
Thursday.
	   Nano urged that NATO undertake humanitarian operations in the
impoverished northern area where the refugees are staying,
assisting them with medicines and food.
	   About 12,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from the Serb offensive in
secessionist Kosovo have arrived since last weekend, Interior
Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhja said Thursday. Thousands of others
are believed to be trying to join them.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano stressed.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lifes and the peace in Kosovo,'' he told Solana.
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the border town where most have arrived.

World Cup: Brazil's doubts persist as warmups end
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MUELLO  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ How ready is Brazil for the World Cup?
Coach Mario Zagallo frankly doesn't know _ and the final warmup
game before tournament did little to dispel the doubts.
	   A 3-0 victory Wednesday over tiny Andorra, with barely enough
professional players for three teams, was no test for the four-time
world champions. For Zagallo, it wasn't even a real game.
	   ``It was a practice, not a game,'' he admitted. ``It was
positive mainly from the midfield forward, (but) the defense wasn't
tested at any time.''
	   That's the problem. Brazil won the 1994 World Cup with tough
defense, leaving Romario and Bebeto to handle the goal-scoring
chores. The current generation is a rich mixture of attackers, but
the defense remains a question mark.
	   Dunga and Aldair, two mainstays of the '94 squad, are over 30
and slower than four years ago. The upfield charges by defenders
Roberto Carlos and Cafu are a key to Brazil's offense, but there's
not always coverage for the holes they leave.
	   Against Andorra, Brazil attacked with as many as nine players.
That was too much even for Zagallo, and he ordered his fullbacks to
return to the backfield where they belong.
	   Eternally optimistic, Zagallo plays down the danger of an
untested defense. He thinks no team dares to go toe-to-toe with his
_ least of all Scotland, which faces Brazil in the Cup opener next
Wednesday.
	   ``We expect them to play in counterattacks,'' Zagallo said.
``Scotland plays with five defenders. That gives you an idea.''
	   The offense, meanwhile, is adjusting to life without Romario.
The 32-year-old hero of the '94 Cup was cut from the team on
Tuesday, when it became clear that a calf muscle injury wouldn't
heal in time for the tournament.
	   Against Andorra, Bebeto replaced Romario in the front line
alongside two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo. But both seemed
to miss the presence of Romario in the penalty area, for years a
point of reference for the offense.
	   Ronaldo, despite some brilliant runs, was repeatedly thwarted by
Andorra's 'keeper Koldo Alvarez. Bebeto showed good movement but
blew his best scoring chance, a pass from Ronaldo that he shot high
and wide from inside the area.
	   Giovanni and Rivaldo, teammates on FC Barcelona, scored a minute
apart in the first period, while Cafu concluded the scoring on an
individual end-to-end run.
	   For Zagallo, the result shows that Brazil has a greater
offensive arsenal than four years ago. And the team's patient,
ball-control offense will be the key to success at the Cup.
	   ``Andorra had everybody in the penalty area _ there were 19
players in 30 meters of field. It's difficult to find spaces,'' he
said. ``You have to keep pressuring, keep hammering away. That
wears out the team without the ball, and suddenly the space
appears.''
	   The many missed goals were not a concern.
	   ``If we missed a lot of goals, it means we created a lot of
chances,'' said team captain Dunga, preparing for his third World
Cup. ``Soccer is like chess. You have to have patience, and
everyone has to take part.''
	   ``Sometimes the best play is to open a space for a teammate,''
he added. ``Nobody plays open with Brazil.''
	   For team coordinator Zico, a veteran of three Cups, it wouldn't
help Brazil to play a Cup contender now. In effect, the tournament
already has begun.
	   ``The teams now are studying each other, not giving anything
away, not lowering their guard,'' he said. ``In the World Cup, you
can't slip up. The World Cup is different.''

U.S. missile chief tours Russian weapons sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The commanders of the strategic nuclear forces of
Russia and the United States toured a Siberian missile facility
together on Thursday as part of a week-long confidence-building
trip, officials said.
	   The tour is the third by U.S. Gen. Eugene Habiger and Russian
Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev. Habiger made a similar visit to Russia
last October, and Yakovlev toured the United States in March.
	   The trips are designed to foster trust between the two strategic
commands, whose weapons threatened mutual destruction during the
Cold War.
	   Habiger's tour will include six facilities throughout Russia,
including the Vitebsk division of the strategic rocket forces,
located outside the Siberian city of Irkutsk, American embassy
officials said.

Technicians' strike severely disrupts BBC news
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with changes in World Service in grafs 5-6  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 24-hour technicians' strike Thursday wiped out
dozens of BBC domestic news programs and curtailed some of the
corporation's international World Service broadcasts.
	   The technicians' union said its 7,000 members employed by the
British Broadcasting Corp. walked off the job starting at midnight
(2300 GMT Wednesday) in a dispute over what they view as the
gradual privatization of the BBC.
	   The corporation, funded largely by compulsory license fees, has
undergone huge changes in the past five years as managers seek to
adapt to increasing competition from commercially funded
broadcasters and technological advances.
	   News bulletins on BBC TV morning shows were curtailed, and
virtually uninterrupted classical music replaced the corporation's
flagship current affairs program on Radio 4.
	   BBC's World Service, which broadcasts overseas, said it was
maintaining its 24-hour service in English, but reducing its news
programs. Pre-recorded programs were being added to fill in the
schedule.
	   The foreign-language services also were continuing to broadcast,
with some changes possible in format and content, a spokeswoman
said.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets continued to lose ground
Thursday, dragged down by more bad economic news at home and
continued concern about Hong Kong's troubled economy. The key
indices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia plunged.
Indonesia's shares rallied as foreign investors made a cautious
return. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index sank 3 percent
to close at 8,558, one day after breaking a seven-session losing
streak. The index had plunged more than 10 percent before
Wednesday. In Singapore, fears of a looming recession, official
predictions of growing unemployment, and a falling Singapore dollar
also sent shares down, with the key Strait Times Industrials Index
plunging to its lowest level since mid-January. After a week of
falling steadily, the index tumbled 32.06 points, or 2.62 percent,
crashing through the 1,200-point floor to reach 1,187.74. (ASIAN

	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) _ German car-maker Audi, a subsidiary
of Volkswagen, said Thursday it was offering 350 million marks
(dlrs 197.7 million) to buy British-based Cosworth motor producers,
a subsidiary of Vickers. In a statement from its headquarters in
Ingolstadt, Audi said both companies had already signed
declarations of intent on the deal, but it was contingent on
whether Vickers stockholders vote to sell its Rolls Royce division
to Volkswagen and the sale is consummated. Vickers stockholders are
to vote on who will buy its Rolls Royce works on Friday. Top
bidders are the Munich-based BMW and Volkswagen in Wolfsburg. Audi
also said purchase of Cosworth still requires the approval of both
companies' supervisory boards. (GERMANY-AUDI-COSWORTH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's stock market rebounded further Thursday
despite the government's insistence that a quick bailout package
was unlikely. Expectation of such emergency aid has buoyed Russia's
troubled financial markets, which have regained much of the ground
they lost last week when jittery investors began to pull out of
Russia. By midday, Russia's stock exchange had climbed another 4
percent, following increases of 12 percent Tuesday and 8 percent
Wednesday. Many analysts have credited the improvement to rumors of
new lending from the International Monetary Fund or others to ease
the government's desperate cash flow problem. But the Kremlin has
expressed little enthusiasm for a bailout package like the ones
offered to Asian countries. A Finance Ministry spokesman insisted
late Wednesday that Russia hasn't requested emergency aid, and will
announce a new borrowing program by early next week.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG accelerated its plans to buy
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., agreeing Thursday also to purchase a
high-performance engine company from the parent of the fabled
luxury automaker. Vickers PLC has agreed to sell Rolls-Royce to
Volkswagen for 430 million pounds (dlrs 700 million) and hopes to
get final approval from shareholders on Friday. Just before that
crucial meeting, Vickers said early Thursday that Volkswagen will
buy its Cosworth engine company for 120 million pounds (dlrs 196
million) as part of the Rolls-Royce deal. Cosworth makes some of
the engines for Rolls-Royce, but the acquisition would only be a
partial solution if Volkswagen's rival, German carmaker BMW, makes
good on a threat to cut off supplying engines for Rolls-Royce after
any sale of the company to VW. (BRITAIN-ROLLS-ROYCE)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A computer firm once billed as the
cornerstone of a new, high-tech Thailand took a step closer
Thursday to becoming the first major test case of new Thai
bankruptcy laws. Alphatec Electronics PCL said a bankruptcy judge
had accepted a petition from six creditor banks to reorganize the
company under the country's revised, creditor-friendly bankruptcy
laws. The computer-chip company said in a statement to the Stock
Exchange of Thailand that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing
to appoint a planner to oversee the reorganization. The creditors
have sought the appointment of accounting giant Price Waterhouse.
Because of the proceedings, Alphatec asked the exchange to rescind
a directive requiring the company to appoint a financial planner by
Thursday or face delisting. The company's stock has been suspended
since July 25, 1997. (THAILAND-COMPUTER BANKRUPTCY)

category codes:
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Hundreds of workers lifted chunks of a
collapsed overpass with cranes Thursday to search for victims
trapped in passenger cars crushed and buried when the speediest
train on Germany's rails jumped the tracks. At least 100 people
died when the lead locomotive of Hamburg-bound InterCity Express
884 broke loose at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday
morning, leaving behind 12 passenger cars and a second locomotive
that careened off the tracks and crunched together like an
accordion. Rescuer workers expected to recover more bodies from a
first-class car and a severed dining car still wedged beneath the
arching ruins of the overpass, but said it was unlikely survivors
would be found. (GERMANY-TRAIN DERAILS)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
Thursday put into high gear their campaign against a South Asian
arms race threatened by Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests. A
diplomat said China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States
planned to use their emergency meeting here ``to find a formula for
defusing the tension'' between the two rival countries. ``They see
their role as one facilitating a reduction of tension in the
subcontinent and to persuade India and Pakistan to sign up to the
global regime against nuclear proliferation,'' said the diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, who is chairing the meeting, has ruled out joint sanctions
against India and Pakistan, but experts from the five countries
were putting together a common position. (UN-INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dissidents and a disgraced Communist Party
reformer drew intensified police scrutiny as plainclothes officers
closely watched Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Thursday, the ninth
anniversary of the armed quelling of massive democracy protests.
Police quickly pounced on two men, one in a wheelchair, who threw
leaflets in the air near the obelisk Monument to the People's
Heroes at the heart of the vast square. Although their protest
seemingly had no connection to the anniversary _ the leaflets
demanded compensation for a crippling shooting in southeastern
Fujian province _ the police reaction shows how sensitive the
bloody end to the popular protest movement remains nine years on.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike by Air France pilots entered its fourth
day Thursday, with some encouraging words from the leading pilots'
union but more transport chaos casting a dark cloud on the World
Cup soccer tournament. A second round of talks at Air France on
Wednesday ended with no agreement, though a spokesman for the
leading union SNPL said Thursday morning that things looked ``more
optimistic than the day before yesterday.'' ``It's a little bit
premature'' to say the end is near, spokesman Christian Paris told
RTL radio, but he predicted ``significant advances'' in a new round
of talks at 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT). But France's labor troubles
continued to widen Thursday, six days from the World Cup. (AIR

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Pounding rains that turned roads to
muck have grounded aid helicopters carrying urgently needed food
and medical supplies to survivors of a massive earthquake in
northern Afghanistan that killed as many as 5,000 people. The
extent of the damage from Saturday's 6.9-magnitude quake remained
unclear Thursday, with helicopter crews locating devastated
villages that hadn't appeared previously on aid agencies' maps.
From helicopters, aid workers could see entire villages that had
been flattened _ some buried under landslides and others sent
tumbling into valleys below by the shaking earth.

Israel sending humanitarian aid to Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will send 15 tons of tents, blankets,
food and medicine to earthquake victims in Afghanistan, the Foreign
Ministry said Thursday.
	   Since Israel has no diplomatic ties with Afghanistan, ruled by
the Islamic Taliban army, the aid will be flown to Dushanbe,
Tajikistan. From there, it will be delivered to international aid
agencies that will distribute it in Afghanistan, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   The plane will leave on Sunday morning with the provisions and
an Israeli delegation headed by lawmaker Reuven Rivlin of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party.
	   The extent of the damage from Saturday's 6.9-magnitude quake
remained unclear but it is estimated that as many as 5,000 people
were killed in landslides that sent some mountain villages into the
valleys below and obliterated others.

Dozens of would-be immigrants from North Africa detained off
</HEADLINE>
Spanish coast  

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Coast guards intercepted two boats
carrying 44 would-be immigrants in the Strait of Gibraltar early
Thursday as they approached the southern Spanish coast, police
said.
	   An echo on a radar alerted coast guards in the port of Algeciras
to the presence of a makeshift boat carrying 25 men and two women
from North Africa, police spokeswoman Amelia Garcia said.
	   The boat was intercepted at 4.30 a.m. (0230gmt) and deportations
procedures initiated, Garcia said.
	   Three hours later coast guards arrested a further 17 men in the
same area who were traveling in a different boat from North Africa
and who were transporting 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of hashish
aboard.
	   Poverty and unemployment in north Africa lead thousands to seek
a better life in Europe every year. Spain serves as a major entry
point as the Strait of Gibraltar that separates it from Morocco is
as narrow as 12 miles (20 kilometers) in places.
	   Spanish police say there has been a notable increase in recent
months of the number of would-be immigrants attempting to make the
potentially dangerous crossing.

President Ramos suspends official who bought suspect documents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos has suspended a
top cultural commission official who bought documents that may have
been either fake or stolen from the national archives, officials
said Thursday.
	   Ramos suspended Carmen Padilla, executive director of the
National Commission on Culture and the Arts, for 90 days starting
Thursday while an investigation is conducted.
	   Marlyn Sanchez, a commission official, said Padilla arranged the
purchase in 1996 of documents pertaining to Philippine national
heroes Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio, some of which could have
been fake or stolen from the archives.
	   She said Padilla had the purchase approved by board members of
the commission at 1.5 million pesos (dlrs 38,460) in 1995 but the
actual price paid was 3.7 million pesos (dlrs 94,870) a year later.
	   The government is investigating whether Padilla should be
charged with graft or violation of government purchasing
procedures, Sanchez said.
	   The documents' authenticity, importance and monetary value were
not verified before payment was made, she said.
	   Another official said one document appeared to have been signed
by Bonifacio in 1872, which would put the revolutionary hero at
only nine years old. Bonifacio, who founded a secret society that
led a revolt against Spain, was born in 1863.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession from 1565 to 1898.
	   Padilla could not be reached for comment.
	   Some of the documents were to be used for public exhibits during
the June 12 centennial of Philippine independence from 333 years of
Spanish colonial rule.

Abkhazian leader plans to meet shortly with Georgian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The leader of Georgia's breakaway
province of Abkhazia said Thursday that recent progress in peace
talks has cleared the way for a meeting with President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
	   Abkhazian separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba said he was
planning to meet Shevardnadze ``within days'' after making
``significant progress'' during preliminary contacts with the
government.
	   There was no immediate comment from Shevardnadze's office.
	   Ardzinba spoke after meeting with Boris Berezovsky, a
controversial Russian business mogul now serving as executive
secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a coalition of
former Soviet republics which has tried to resolve the conflict
over Abkhazia.
	   Berezovsky has been shuttling between Abkhazia and the Georgian
capital Tbilisi this week in an effort to arrange a meeting between
Shevardnadze and Ardzinba.
	   ``Preconditions have been created for decisions ... which would
satisfy both peoples,'' Berezovsky said in the Abkhazian town of
Gagra, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992 and drove out Georgian troops and 300,000
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Peace talks have remained stalled and fighting has frequently
flared up in the region. Abkhazians have balked at letting Georgian
refugees return and some 38,000 who were able to return were fled
again during last month's fighting.

Skull suggests human features began developing earlier
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE E. ALLEN  
  AP Science Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A million-year-old skull discovered in east
Africa suggests human facial features began appearing 300,000 years
earlier than previously believed, researchers say.
	   The well-preserved fossil, lodged in silt and clay in Eritrea,
is the only skull found in Africa from between 1.4 million and
600,000 years ago, and thus fills in a gap in the fossil record,
the researchers said.
	   It combines features of both the human ancestor Homo erectus and
modern man, or Homo sapiens, the researchers said. As a result,
they aren't ready yet to assign it to one species or the other.
	   The analysis was done by Ernesto Abbate of the University of
Florence in Italy and colleagues from South Africa, Switzerland and
Eritrea. It was published in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
	   Scientists have long debated when, where and how Homo sapiens
emerged from more primitive species. Some anthropologists believe
that human facial features _ that is, Homo sapiens features _ did
not begin appearing until about 700,000 years ago.
	   Homo erectus had a flat skull, a sloping forehead and a thicker
brow and smaller brain than Homo sapiens.
	   The skull unearthed in Eritrea bears some of the primitive
characteristics of Homo erectus, such as the large brow ridge.
	   But it is like Homo sapiens in one important aspect: The skull
is widest at a higher point than skulls of Homo erectus, which are
widest near ear level. That could indicate a larger brain.
	   Because the fossil have not yet been fully cleaned,
reconstructed and studied, the authors cautioned that their
assessment is preliminary.
	   The skull, two lower teeth and two fragments of a pelvis were
found in 1995 to 1997 near remains of animals that roamed the
African savannah at the time, including three-toed horses.
	   Scientists generally believe Homo sapiens evolved in Africa,
then moved toward Europe and Asia. Abbate said the fossil's
location in Eritrea, which borders the Red Sea and lies between
Ethiopia and Sudan, fits with that theory of northward migration.
	   Outside experts said that if the skull's estimated age is
accurate, it fills a gap in the fossil history of Africa. But they
questioned the accuracy of the dating method, which relies on
variations in magnetic properties of the surrounding rocks.
	   In addition, Richard Sherwood, an anthropologist at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, said it would be hard to draw
many conclusions from the preliminary analysis.
	   ``To try to link it to Homo sapiens on the basis of one trait is
kind of a tenuous association _ plus the fact they themselves say
the skull has not been reconstructed or studied properly,'' he
said.

Indonesian student protesters tear down U.S. flag at consulate
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.S. official throughout
  By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student demonstrators on Thursday tore
down an American flag on the grounds of the U.S. consulate in
Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city. Police arrested one
student.
	   Hours later U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia
Stanley Roth met Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie in Jakarta
and said political stability had to be achieved before Indonesia
could overcome massive economic problems.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, meanwhile, urged Americans to defer
non-essential travel to Indonesia, saying the political and
economic climate was still volatile.
	   Thousands of Americans and other foreigners fled Indonesia last
month as student protests and riots over price increases jolted the
capital, Jakarta. The unrest, which killed more than 1,000 people,
helped oust President Suharto last month after three decades in
power.
	   Several dozen students from the Islamic Muhammadiyah University
gathered outside the U.S. consulate in Surabaya for several hours
to protest what they said was U.S. interference in Indonesia's
internal affairs.
	   One protester climbed onto the fence and lowered an American
flag from a pole, replacing it with a red and white Indonesian
flag. He was later arrested.
	   The demonstrators outside the consulate trampled on and tore up
the American flag. Diplomatic staff stayed inside the consulate.
	   U.S. officials at the consulate and the embassy declined to
comment.
	   Surabaya, which has a population of 3 million, is 800 kilometers
(500 miles) east of the capital.
	   At a news conference after his meeting with Habibie, Roth did
not make reference to the Surabaya incident. However, he denied
that Washington had, in any way, interfered in Indonesia's internal
affairs.
	   ``We took no steps to try in any way to undermine President
Suharto personally or the economy of Indonesia, as some have
alleged. That is false,'' Roth said.
	   Small groups of students have staged protests this week outside
the U.S. Embassy in the capital, accusing Washington of conspiring
to delay international loans for economically battered Indonesia.
	   The United States is a key player in the International Monetary
Fund, a 182-nation lending agency which suspended a dlrs 43 billion
bailout for Indonesia because of the political turmoil. The IMF is
reviewing when to restart loan disbursements.
	   Roth said the United States wanted to see political stability in
Indonesia so that the IMF package and other measures can succeed.
	   ``Economic assistance can only be helpful if it is introduced
into an environment where it has a chance to work,'' Roth said.
	   ``There has to be a degree of stability and calm in the country
that allows the economic institutions to function. That requires a
resolution of ... the political crisis.''
	   Habibie has pledged to reform Indonesia's rigid political system
and to hold elections in 1999.
	   Roth said that it was up to Indonesia to decide what the type of
reforms were needed and the exact timing of elections.
	   However, he said the United States wanted to see a process ``of
genuine dialogue that works, meaning that it is broadly acceptable
to the people of Indonesia and that it results in a resolution of
the situation.''
	   He said the United States would be satisfied if the reform
process ``is an open and transparent one, and that the outcome is a
democratic one.''
	   Roth also said he was pleased to a number of quick reforms, such
as the release of some political prisoners, a relaxation of
restrictions on labor unions and greater media freedom.
	   In a travel advisory issued Thursday, the U.S. State Department
said that, ``Although violence has subsided, the political and
economic situation in Indonesia remains unsettled.''
	   Posted on the embassy's Internet home page, the warning to defer
non-essential travel was a softening of the U.S. government
position. Last month, the embassy urged Americans to defer all
travel to Indonesia.

Israeli dailies publish U.S. peace initiative
</HEADLINE>
  By GWEN ACKERMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli daily on Thursday published the
complete U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal that would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control and
restrict Jewish settlement expansion.
	   Details of the U.S. initiative have been reported in the past.
Thursday marked the first time the plan was published in its
entirety _ prompting some speculation about who leaked the document
and why.
	   Israel's three major dailies published details of the plan
Thursday. Haaretz's version was the most comprehensive. Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points of the initiative as
published in Haaretz.
	   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
inaccurate, but would not elaborate. A spokesman for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Haaretz published an outdated draft.
	   U.S. officials expect a decision from Israel within days on the
plan, and there were indications Thursday that Netanyahu has
softened his initial resistance.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Netanyahu embraced most of the
proposals, including a 13 percent troop pullback over 12 weeks. The
sticking point was the scope of an additional withdrawal, it said.
Netanyahu wants to limit that pullback to 2 percent, but the
Palestinians said they expected a more generous offer.
	   ``We will never agree to a 2 percent redeployment,'' Asfour told
The Associated Press.
	   Under the American plan, the scope of the next pullback would be
negotiated later and not included in the current package, he said.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to meet with senior Palestinian
negotiators in London on Thursday to discuss the U.S. plan.
	   Netanyahu briefed President Ezer Weizman on the negotiations
Thursday. ``I don't want to say that it is over yet, but I am more
optimistic than in the past,'' Weizman said afterward.
	   Meantime, there was speculation about who leaked the plan and
why. If the Netanyahu government handed the plan to the newspapers,
it might have been a way of testing public opinion.
	   A majority of Israelis want Netanyahu to forge ahead with the
peace process with the Palestinians, but far-right coalition
partners have threatened to bring down his government over a troop
pullback.
	   A leak by U.S. officials may be intended to pressure Israel into
a quick decision. The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker,
said Wednesday that Israel had days, not weeks, as suggested by
Netanyahu, to make a decision.
	   Under the plan, Israel would withdraw troops in three stages
over 12 weeks. The Palestinians currently control 3 percent of the
West Bank and partially control another 24 percent. At the end of
the pullback, they would fully control 18.2 percent and partially
control 22 percent, for a total of 40 percent _ a possible
springboard for statehood.
	   Talks on a permanent peace accord would begin immediately with
the first troop pullback.
	   In the agreement, Israel would promise not to expand Jewish
settlements in a significant way, refrain from demolishing 1,800
Palestinian homes currently slated for construction and restrict
land confiscations.
	   Also, the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather than the much
larger Palestine National Council would vote to annul sections of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   In addition, the Palestinians would not question Israeli
credentials at the United Nations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
would outlaw incitement against Israel and systematically
confiscate illegal weapons.
	   A trilateral committee would meet every two weeks to discuss
security matters. An American-Palestinian committee would follow up
on the cases of suspected Palestinian militants. Israel has
complained about a revolving door policy under which Islamic
militants were arrested for show and then quickly released.

Khomeini's grandson calls for unity, praises Khatami
</HEADLINE>
  By EARLEEN FISHER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With the rift widening between supporters
and foes of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, the grandson of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Iranians toward unity Thursday on
the anniversary of the revolutionary patriarch's death.
	   ``Today Khatami is the man who is providing the best assistance
for the thoughts of Imam Khomeini and the current leadership of the
country,'' Hassan Khomeini said. ``Khatami is establishing the
pillars of the thinking of the Imam in the society.''
	   The young Khomeini spoke to a huge crowd at the late Imam's
gold-domed shrine outside Tehran during a ceremony marking the
ninth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death.
	   Like President Khatami, Hassan Khomeini is a hojatoleslam, or
mid-level cleric. Both wear black turbans identifying them as
direct descendants of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ an important sign
of political and religious prestige in this overwhelmingly Shiite
Muslim nation.
	   Hassan Khomeini, thought to be in his mid-20s, also invoked a
familiar theme of the Islamic revolution that toppled the
pro-American Shah in 1979 and installed a fundamentalist
government:
	   ``Whoever talks about relations with the U.S. government ... is
far from the thinking of the Imam (Ayatollah Khomeini).''
	   Invoking the words of his late grandfather, Hassan Khomeini said
midway through his 40-minute speech: ``Relations with the United
States are as (impossible as) relations between the wolf and the
lamb.''
	   That brought the crowd to its feet in the Iranian revolution's
battle cry of ``marg bar Amrika'' _ ``death to America.''
	   Khatami, a relative moderate who was elected president a year
ago in a landslide victory over hardliners, has advocated dialogue
between the Iranian and American peoples _ but not their
governments. Khatami attended Thursday's ceremony but did not
speak.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the late Khomeini's successor as Iran's
supreme spiritual and political leader, addressed the crowd in an
unusually quiet voice and spoke for less than 15 minutes.
	   Vehemently anti-American but less outspoken on the subject since
Khatami's election, Khamenei praised Iran's youth as the hope of
the Islamic revolution and called the United States and Israel
``the defeated enemies of Islam.''
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
death, Khamenei has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``My friends and doctors would not allow me to talk longer than
this,'' the 58-year-old Khamenei said.
	   Journalists who cover Khamenei on a daily basis said he had a
bad cold but the ailment was not serious.
	   The crowd appeared to number in the tens of thousands, not the
hundreds of thousands that came in previous years.
	   Thursday's turnout was about the same size as the one at a rally
in Tehran on May 23, the first anniversary of Khatami's election.
	   But there was an important difference: The demonstrators who at
Khatami's rally were almost all Tehran residents, many university
students.
	   The throng at the Khomeini shrine, only 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Tehran _ while including many people from the capital _
was swelled by contingents bussed from faraway cities and
provinces.
	   The crowd _ mostly men, carefully segregated from the women in
all-enveloping black chadors _ surged forward during Hassan
Khomeini's speech and when Khamenei appeared. They were held back
by steel-bar fences and Revolutionary Guards.
	   Every few minutes, young men and boys fainted in the 32-degree
centigrade (90-degree Fahrenheit) heat. Their inert bodies were
passed by hands over the heads of the crowd until they could be
lowered onto the stretchers.
	   Among the first to faint was Mehdi Hosseini, a 15-year-old
Tehran schoolboy, who regained consciousness after being fanned
with a poster bearing the image of Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   ``I've been coming here for several years,'' the teen-ager said.
``I arrived last night and started praying, eating only one
sandwich.
	   ``I'm here because Khomeini was a great man who changed
history.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos guided
successor Joseph Estrada around the presidential palace Thursday,
giving him household tips, including ways of warding off evil
spirits.
	   ``This is the biggest challenge of my life,'' Estrada said after
arriving with his wife and children for the four-hour tour.
	   The two leaders prayed in a chapel before Ramos led the Estradas
on the tour of the Malacanang presidential palace, a guest house,
barracks of presidential guards, a nine-hole golf course and secret
passages.
	   So far, the transfer of power to Estrada has proceeded smoothly
despite predictions of resistance from Ramos' camp. Estrada, an
opposition leader, will be the Philippines' third president since
the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos was ousted by a ``people
power'' revolt in 1986.
	   ``This smooth turnover is reinforcing our democracy,'' Estrada
said.
	   At one point, Ramos stopped in front of a huge ficus tree in the
lawn fronting the palace and suggested to Estrada that he put a lot
of glass on that side of the palace to ward off evil spirits said
to be inhabiting the tree.
	   Chinese geomancers, called in by Ramos shortly after he took
power in 1992, said evil spirits might be thriving on the tree, a
type that superstitious Filipinos say is a favorite abode of
hostile spirits.
	   Estrada told reporters that he will be the first president since
Marcos to live inside the palace, located along the bank of Pasig
River in Manila's crowded San Miguel residential district, but
would open it up to the people.
	   The palace was built in the early 1800s as the summer residence
of the Spanish governor-general. The Spanish colonial government
made it the seat of power in 1863 when an earthquake destroyed the
governor-general's office in the nearby Intramuros district.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession from 1565 to 1898.
	   After Marcos' ouster, the palace was turned into a museum
showing his family's opulent lifestyle.
	   Estrada has said he will live in Malacanang only six months a
year, splitting the rest of the time between the two other major
regions of the country to reach out to the people.
	   Ramos has scheduled a series of briefings to make the turnover
of the presidency as smooth as possible.
	   On Monday, Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre, a retired
general who has been retained by Estrada as his national security
adviser, briefed Estrada and Vice President-elect Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo on national security.
	   Estrada, elected in May 11 polls, gained a devoted following
among the country's many poor during a career as a movie star
portraying tough guys who stood up to injustice.

position, airline traffic report, baggage handlers strike
continuing

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A strike by Air France pilots entered its fourth
day Thursday, with some encouraging words from the leading pilots'
union but more transport chaos casting a dark cloud on the World
Cup soccer tournament.
	   A third round of talks in the pilots' pay dispute was scheduled
Thursday evening at Air France, and a spokesman for the leading
union SNPL said things looked ``more optimistic than the day before
yesterday.
	   ``It's a little bit premature'' to say the end is near,
spokesman Christian Paris told RTL radio, but he predicted
``significant advances'' in the talks slated for 6:30 p.m. (1630
GMT).
	   Still, France's labor troubles widened Thursday, six days from
the World Cup.
	   One Paris subway workers' union staged a partial strike, rail
workers were striking in the Provence-Riviera region until Friday,
and the Communist-led CGT union organized protest marches in Paris.
	   More than 1,000 electrical and gas workers marched from Place de
la Bastille toward Place Saint Augustin, protesting the
European-mandated deregulation of France's electrical monopoly.
Other marches were planned by hotel, department store and weapons
plant workers.
	   Other pay disputes threatened to paralyze trains this weekend,
and airline mechanics chimed in with plans for their own walkout.
	   A nightmare for passengers, an indefinite strike by baggage
handlers at Charles de Gaulle Airport continued for a third day
Thursday, the airport authority said.
	   The transport chaos has unsettled and embarrassed French
politicians and World Cup officials, who now fear one of the
world's biggest sporting events may fizzle into a fiasco instead of
a French triumph.
	   The airline ``has the full support of the government,'' the
Socialist finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told the
National Assembly. He said pilot's salaries, among the highest in
the business, ``are among the elements needing reform.''
	   Commenting for the first time on the strike, President Jacques
Chirac on Wednesday night called on both sides to ``show proof of
their responsibility'' in the dispute as France prepares to become
``the host country of the planet.''
	   But CGT chief Louis Viannet said the World Cup didn't mean
unions would call a truce.
	   ``The World Cup is one thing, but the fact it exists doesn't do
away with the problems. Don't be surprised that if the problems
remain'' labor protests continue, he told Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Despite the strike, Air France has guaranteed travel throughout
the tournament for all participating teams.
	   Air France said it maintained a Thursday schedule of 17 percent
of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of its short and
medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40
percent from Orly.
	   The company wants to give its 3,200 pilots stock in exchange for
500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts and has offered to
eventually eliminate a two-tier salary schedule.
	   The carrier, which managed to report a profit in the last two
years, could lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per day
during the strike.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Using cranes, jackhammers and cutting
torches, hundreds of workers searched Thursday through shattered
passenger cars and beneath a collapsed bridge for bodies crushed
and buried when Germany's swiftest train jumped the tracks.
	   At least 100 people died when the lead locomotive of
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 broke loose at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning, leaving behind 12 passenger
cars and a second locomotive that careened off the tracks and
crunched together like an accordion.
	   With few clues to the cause of the disaster, Deutsche Bahn
officials ordered all InterCity Express trains to slow to a maximum
160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour along the 3,500 kilometers
(2,175 miles) of system designed for top speeds of 280 kilometers
(175 miles) an hour.
	   Rescue workers expected to recover more bodies from a
first-class car and a dining car still wedged beneath the arching
ruins of the overpass at Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Hanover.
	   ``We think the chances of finding further survivors are very
small,'' police spokesman Peter Hoppe said.
	   The four parallel tracks were strewn with stray wheels, shards
of metal and other debris _ much of it the result of rescuers
cutting and smashing their way into the mangled hulks of train
cars.
	   Some of Eschede's 6,500 residents brought blankets for
survivors, others opened their homes to anxious relatives of
missing passengers, and handed out coffee and food to exhausted
rescue workers.
	   ``How could we know that this horrible thing would happen in
this beautiful place?'' said Bernd Schlawer, 45, who recalled
taking a bike ride with five of his children across the overpass
two days earlier.
	   Ninety bodies were recovered so far and two more people died in
the hospital. Lower Saxony state officials said 100 people had been
killed and 200 people were injured; 95 had been treated in
hospitals for serious injuries, according to police.
	   Twenty-four hours after the accident, there were no firm
estimates of how many people were on board the train, or how many
might have walked away from the crash. The search for the dead and
the hope of survivors took precedence over the investigation of the
cause.
	   ``There is no indication that the derailment was anything other
than an accident,'' police spokesman Hoppe said.
	   The tragedy, the worst on Germany's rails since World War II,
sent the nation into mourning _ and into action. Flags flew at
half-staff at all public buildings on Thursday. As news of the
crash spread, people rushed to donate blood at Red Cross centers
throughout the country, in some cases leaving work earlier or
lining up for hours at some centers.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, clearly shaken by the scope of the
calamity, cut short a trip to Italy and arrived at the scene early
in the afternoon.
	   His challenger in national elections in September, Lower Saxony
state governor Gerhard Schroeder, arrived at the Eschede rescue
coordination center early Thursday and pledged immediate assistance
to victims and families.
	   It was unclear why the lead locomotive broke away from the rest
of the train, and whether the derailment was caused by the
decoupling, a problem with the rails or above on the overpass.
	   Police said four cars got through the overpass before derailing.
Still pushed by the rear engine, the others jumped the tracks,
slammed against the concrete supports of the overpass and
jackknifed.
	   Oblivious to the catastrophe, the driver of the lead locomotive
continued through Eschede until the station master engaged the
emergency brake.
	   Deutsche Bahn executive Peter Muenschwander confirmed that two
workers who had been doing signal maintenance on an adjacent track
were missing and presumed dead.
	   ``They were not doing any track work,'' Deutsche Bahn spokesman
Hans-Juergen Frohns told the news conference.
	   At the accident site, a red crane hoisted a severed train car
from the overpass early Thursday so workers with jackhammers would
pull apart the overpass to reach the crushed cars beneath.
	   Other cranes lifted bodies on stretchers to doctors, who
unzipped the plastic body bags to confirm the victims were dead.
	   Residents living along the tracks heard a loud explosion and a
horrible crushing sound.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Hannelore Domkewitz, who was peeling potatoes at her kitchen window
when she saw the train speed by just before the crash.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle before the accident.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said. ``Thank
God, it came to a standstill.''
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the deadliest since World War II.
	   The ICE _ which connects all major German cities at speeds up to
280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour _ suffered its only other
serious accident during the first year of operation when a train
killed six track workers who did not hear it coming.

Newly released from house arrest, Kaunda announces his plans
</HEADLINE>

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda announced
Thursday he wants to retire from direct involvement in politics but
play a role ``on a wider scale'' in helping organize opposition to
President Frederick Chiluba's rule.
	   Kaunda, 74, freed Monday after five months under house arrest,
said he will propose to step down at a special convention of his
United National Independence Party.
	   ``(I want to) detach myself from party politics so I may make a
contribution on a wider scale,'' Kaunda told a news conference.
	   He gave no indication when the party congress might be held.
Party officials said it could take several weeks to arrange
facilities and raise funds to bring 3,000 party delegates to
Lusaka, the capital.
	   Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964,
said he wanted to help his party and ``other sister parties'' mount
a strong political opposition against Chiluba's government.
	   Kaunda also said he wanted to become a peace mediator and roving
ambassador in Africa for the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community, to which Zambia belongs.
	   Kaunda, who is often ovecome by emotion, wept and dabbed his
eyes with his trademark white handkerchief during the news
conference.
	   ``I see African children dying in their thousands, I see men and
women killing each other. Do you expect me to be quiet?'' he said.
	   Kaunda was arrested on Christmas day for allegedly concealing
knowledge of an Oct. 28 coup attempt by junior military officers.
The coup attempt was quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   Kaunda was released from house arrest after the state dropped
charges against him.
	   Kaunda's 27 years of dictatorial socialist rule ended when he
was ousted by Chiluba in the first democratic elections in 1991.
Chiluba's ruling party disqualified him from contesting elections
in 1996 and he led an opposition boycott of those polls, easily won
by Chiluba.

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ While the other World Cup nations
are glad to finally make it to France, the French flee.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet and his 22 players fly to Finland early
Thursday, much more to escape the pressure and commotion of being
the host nation than to play the Finnish national team.
	   Even after Friday evening's final preparation game, the team
will enjoy the relative peace of their lakeside hotel close to
Helsinki for another two days before returning to the
pressure-cooker at home.
	   ``It's always refreshing to travel,'' said Jacquet, stressing
the daily drone of monotony would finally get the players down.
	   France's first game is June 12 against South Africa in
Marseille. Denmark and Saudi Arabia complete Group C.
	   With their flight to Finland, some of the French stars are just
happy to get away from the fans and media.
	   ``We'll be able to walk the streets in peace. Our friends won't
call us all the time and,'' said defender Marcel Desailly, eying
the throng of journalists around him, ``you won't be there.''
	   The last dinner was spent with French President Jacques Chirac,
who assured the team he had a ``strong intuition'' he would be able
to present them the World Cup on July 12.
	   Meanwhile, the media has started speculating heavily on the
starting lineup, even suggesting star forward Youri Djorkaeff will
be benched.
	   Jacquet has not been much help to smooth the waters, refusing to
give away any clue. Goalkeeper will be Monaco's Fabien Barthez and
the defense is almost cast in stone with a back four of Lilian
Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu.
	   Captain Didier Deschamps is defensive midfielder and Zinedine
Zidane the playmaker. That leaves four places open for discussion,
including Djorkaeff's.
	   Jacquet's main selection problems have been up front, and the
sudden emergence as potential starters Thierry Henry and Robert
Pires on the wings could alter plans at the last moment, forcing
out a player in the middle.
	   But Djorkaeff's mind is set. ``I have no doubts on the field. I
have confidence.''
	   In midfield, Real Madrid Christian Karembeu long looked a
certainty, especially since he should be much fitter after having
played only half a season. But a disappointing few weeks have cast
major doubt on his place and increased the chances of Arsenal
Emmanuel Petit. Jacquet already benched Karembeu for a preparation
game last week.
	   ``I was so frustrated. I wanted to play and I was on the bench,
powerless,'' he said.

Alaska Airline plane aborts takeoff after engine fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An Alaska Airlines passenger jet aborted its
takeoff Thursday from an airport on Russia's Sakhalin Island after
one of its engines caught fire, a news agency said. No injuries
were reported.
	   The incident occurred when the MD-80 aircraft carrying 23
passengers began its takeoff run on the wrong runway, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The runway was under repair, and chunks of asphalt flew into one
of the engines, causing it to catch fire, Interfax said, citing
officials at the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk airport.
	   Air traffic controllers saw the fire and ordered the pilot to
abort the takeoff, the report said.
	   The Alaska Airlines flight was enroute from Vladivostok to
Anchorage and had to make a stopover on Sakhalin Island, off the
coast of Russia's Pacific coast.
	   Interfax said it is not clear why the pilot tried to take off on
the incorrect runway.

Albania seeks humanitarian aid to cope with refugees
</HEADLINE>
  With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Unable to cope with the estimated 12,000
refugees who have arrived from neighboring embattled Kosovo
province, the Albanian government has asked NATO for humanitarian
aid such as food and medicine, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter sent to
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. The letter was sent late
Wednesday and released Thursday.
	   To Albania's north, bloodshed continues in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians overwhelmingly outnumber
Serbs. The Kosovo Liberation Army, a clandestine rebel force of
unknown size, is fighting for the province's independence, a goal
shared by most ethnic Albanians.
	   Casualty figures are increasingly sketchy, but more than 200
people have been killed since early March.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano said. ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the
only way to save human lifes and the peace in Kosovo.''
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the Albanian border town where most have
arrived.

Nine arrested for plundering 2,200-year-old Chinese tomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have arrested nine people for robbing a
2,200-year-old royal tomb and smuggling its rare bronzes out of
China for sale overseas, the official Wen Hui Bao reported
Thursday.
	   Twenty people took part in plundering three bronze horses,
pieces of a jade funeral dress and other artifacts taken from the
Zhao kingdom royal tomb, from China's Warring States period,
475-221 B.C., the newspaper said.
	   Li Qiang, manager of a privately run mine in northern Hebei
province, provided the cash, explosives and manpower for the
robbery, which took place between March and April 1997.
	   Peasants from Hebei's Sanling village, 400 kilometers (240
miles) south of Beijing, discovered that the Zhao tomb had been
disturbed last October. Investigators fanned out over six provinces
to pursue the looters, the Wen Hui Bao reported.
	   By May 6, the investigators managed to recover the three bronze
horses and a bronze bed from Britain, Hong Kong and other places,
the newspaper said. It gave no details on when the nine suspects
were arrested.

Red Cross resumes operations in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red
Cross said Thursday it has resumed operations in war-torn southern
Sudan after a 19-month suspension due to disagreements with both
the government and rebels.
	   As of Monday, ICRC delegates began flying to the government-held
towns of Malakal, Juba and Leer and to rebel-held Yei, Turalei,
Malwakon and Yirol.
	   An ICRC statement said delegates will also visit an additional
15 locations controlled by both Khartoum and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army to assess relief needs.
	   The statement said Khartoum and SPLA have dropped allegations of
partisanship against the Swiss-run organization ``and the parties
in conflict have given the necessary safety guarantees.''
	   The ICRC suspended operations in November 1996 after a rebel
faction allied with he government seized a relief plane and three
Red Cross workers.
	   The plane was returning to southern Sudan five SPLA fighters who
had been treated in the Kenyan border town of Lokichogio where ICRC
operates a hospital.
	   Sudan claimed the plane was carrying arms for the rebels, which
ICRC denied. The Red Cross workers and the pilot were freed after
37 days following intervention by then U.S. Congressman Bill
Richardson, now Washington's ambassador to the United Nations.
	   The SPLA was angered by what it said was ICRC's failure to
secure the release of its fighters.
	   ``We were not convinced they made enough efforts to have our
people freed,'' John Luc Jok, SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, said
Thursday.
	   John Luc said the five later rejoined rebel ranks.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.

State broadcasting chief arrested in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's new state
broadcasting chief has been arrested for failing to televise a
government ceremony, the president's office said Thursday.
	   Congolese National Radio-Television Commissioner Jean Paul
Elenge Molayi was arrested Tuesday, less than two weeks after he
was appointed.
	   Molayi was accused of trying to undermine the government's
effort to promote national unity and harmony by failing to air the
swearing in ceremony for members of Kabila's new cabinet.
	   ``This is an act of sabotage and negligence,'' said a statement
issued by the President's Office.
	   Molayi was appointed commissioner of the state-controlled
broadcasting services to replace Jose Kajangwa, who was arrested
earlier for televising scenes of alleged massacres in eastern
Congo.
	   The latest arrest follows what appears to be an expanding purge
within Kabila's inner circle.
	   At least five senior cabinet members have been arrested or
detained in recent weeks.
	   On Tuesday, Kabila appointed 15 new ministers, replacing the
detained five and expanding the cabinet by 10, his office said.
	   One year after being praised for ousting longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese-Seko, Kabila is now facing international condemnation
for human rights abuses. Journalists, political opponents and
critics have been jailed since Kabila came to power in May 1997.

  Major points of U.S. peace plan as published by Israeli daily
  Eds: ADDS reference to Israel not building new settlements

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Here are the major points of the U.S. plan for
an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank, as published Thursday
in the Israeli daily Haaretz:
	   Israeli troops will withdraw in three stages over 12 weeks, and
at the end of the process, the Palestinians will have full control
over 18.2 percent of the West Bank and partial control over 22
percent, for a total of 40.2 percent. At the moment, the
Palestinians have full control over 3 percent and partial control
over 24 percent of the land.
	   In the first stage:
	   _ Negotiations on a permanent peace agreement will begin.
	   _ A trilateral committee will deal with security matters and
convene every two weeks, reporting directly to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   _ The Executive Committee of the PLO will endorse Arafat's
letter to President Clinton concerning the PLO Charter.
	   _ Arafat will issue an executive decree against incitement.
	   _ An American-Palestinian security committee will be established
to deal with specific security matters.
	   In the second stage:
	   _ Arafat will ratify the law on arms possession which will be
followed by the establishment of a systematic program for
collection and disposal of illegal weapons.
	   _ The Palestinian side will hand the Israeli side a list of the
names of the Palestinian police force, in conformity with the
interim agreement.
	   In the third stage:
	   _ The Israeli side will carry out a further redeployment.
	   Other points:
	   _ A joint Palestinian-Israeli committee will be established for
the third phase of the further redeployments.
	   _Israel will not build new Jewish settlements and will not
significantly expand existing ones. Expansion is not to take place
beyond the immediate contiguous areas.

Tens of thousands left homeless by Kosovo fighting
</HEADLINE>

official saying Serbs only defending against terrorism, Pristina
protest, one killed at border; TRIMS  
  With BC-Albania-Kosovo Refugees, BC-Yugoslavia-Another War?
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are still hiding in forests hoping to escape,
reports said Thursday.
	   As the refugee exodus into neighboring Albania continued,
officials in that country again pleaded for international
assistance to help deal with the crisis. About 12,000 people from
Kosovo have arrived in Albania since last weekend, they said.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, the other republic left in what remains of
Yugoslavia besides Serbia, officials there said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency says 40,000 people in Kosovo have fled
their homes in the face of the campaign by Serb forces to crush
militants in Kosovo _ to Albania, Montenegro or elsewhere in
Kosovo.
	   But that figure is growing fast, and others say it is a
conservative estimate. Ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo claim
50,000 have been displaced since the start of an earlier crackdown
in March.
	   Many are still on the run within Kosovo, a Serb-ruled province
where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The Albanian-language daily Bujku reported Thursday said
thousands are headed toward the border with Albania, Europe's
poorest country, which already is feeling the strain of the refugee
crush.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center in Kosovo said one man was killed when
a Yugoslav army border patrol fired on an armed group trying to
cross over illegally from Albania.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory. Dozens have been killed since an intensive
campaign began last week, and several villages are reportedly in
ruins.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo,
denied that a war is taking place.
	   ``What this is all about is an increase in terrorist activity
and it's our legitimate right to fight against terrorism,'' he
said. ``All our actions are defensive in character. We are simply
responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for
numerous deadly attacks on Serb police in what it says is a war for
independence from Serb occupiers.
	   In response to growing concerns the Serbs are carrying out a
strategy of forced expulsions of entire villages, Odalovic claimed
ethnic Albanians have ``cleansed entire villages of their Serb
populations.''
	   There was evidence of the militants' growing popularity in the
provincial capital Pristina on Thursday, when more than 10,000
ethnic Albanians flooded the main street to protest the latest Serb
violence.
	   The crowd, comprised mostly of young people, chanted ``U-C-K'' _
Albanian-language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army. Some
carried placards reading ``NATO help save Kosovo.''
	   Unlike in the past, there was not a single chant of ``Rugova'' _
indicating declining support for the ethnic Albanians' long-time
leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist approach has failed to bring
results.
	   Recently opened talks between Rugova and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who is behind the crackdown, are all but dead
as a result of the new offensive.
	   Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian politician,
acknowledged that Rugova has no influence over the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which ``does not want to hear of him.''
	   Western officials are debating whether to send in troops or
impose new sanctions against Yugoslavia. But the West is reluctant
to commit a huge military contingent to the region, with 34,000
troops already in neighboring Bosnia.

More than 100 killed in clashes in eastern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
  By MOHAMED OSMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ More than 100 soldiers were killed in
clashes between Sudanese army and rebels in eastern Sudan over the
past few days, Parliament Speaker Hassan Turabi said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``Sudan sees as martyrs over a hundred persons (killed) during
the past two days in the battles that have taken place in the
southern Blue Nile region,'' Turabi said in a lecture Wednesday
reported in daily Akhbar Al-Youm.
	   On Wednesday, rebel group Sudan People's Liberation Army said it
captured the garrison town of Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles)
southeast of Khartoum, in a daylong battle Tuesday. Ulu is 150
kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of Damazin and the Roseires
dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's electricity.
	   Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha was shown on state-run
television telling crowds that the military buildup in the
southeast will never harm Sudan.
	   ``We renew the faith and confidence and the backing of the
Sudanese people to the armed forces,'' Taha said.
	   The television also showed hundreds of what it called
Mujahedeen, or holy warriors, being addressed by Col. Ibrahim
Shamsuldin, an adviser to President Omar el-Bashir, before they
headed to battle zones.
	   The military forces announced Tuesday there were fierce battles
in the Ulu area but never said if the town fell to rebels.
	   The Al-Rai Al-Akhar newspaper said that el-Bashir and Turabi
held a ``several hours meeting'' about the military and political
situation in the country. El-Bashir was quoted in news reports
Wednesday as declaring general military mobilization.
	   Shamsuldin, who rarely appears on television or at rallies, was
speaking to a unit of men in military fatigue wearing red ribbons
tied around their heads, symbol of martyrdom.
	   Meanwhile, Aliga Tobe, the commander of the Southern Sudan
Defense Forces which signed a peace agreement with the government
last year, said he also expected the rebels to attack Juba, the
largest city in southern Sudan.
	   Tobe was quoted by Akhbar Al-Youm as saying as saying that
arrangements were being made to send troops to battle zones within
days from groups that signed treaties with the government.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 to demand greater
autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the mainly
Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese have
died in the fighting and consequent famines.

Bank of England surprises markets with interest rate increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England raised interest rates by a
quarter-point Thursday, hoping to slow the economy so the Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair can finally hit its
inflation target.
	   Most analysts in London had predicted the central bank would
hold rates steady because the economy appears to cooling down on
its own. The bank instead raised its repo rate, the lowest rate at
which it lends money to commercial banks, to 7.50 percent from 7.25
percent.
	   London stock prices plunged on the news, amid fears that the
higher interest rates will raise the value of the British pound and
make British exports less competitive in global markets. The
already-high value of the pound has hurt earnings at most British
multinationals and stirred fears that manufacturers in particular
could be slipping into recession.
	   Inflation rose to a six-year high of 4 percent in April,
illustrating the government's inability to keep price rises within
the stated target of 2.5 percent. Inflation has exceeded the target
in 10 of the past 11 months.
	   The latest rate rise was the sixth since Blair's government took
office in May 1997.

US calls for political stability as IMF team heads for Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
  With Indonesia-US

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior U.S. official Thursday warned
Indonesia that outside help for its crisis-ridden economy would not
work without political stability.
	   The comments by visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth came as the
International Monetary Fund announced it would send a team to
Indonesia next week before deciding whether to restart a dlrs 43
billion bailout plan.
	   Speaking after talks with new President B.J. Habibie, Roth said
the IMF was working ``expeditiously'' to ``update its economic
agreement.''
	   Roth did not directly address the postponed disbursement of a
dlrs 1 billion tranche of IMF funds to Indonesia or whether the
U.S. supports continued disbursements to Jakarta.
	   ``The position of the United States is that we would like to be
able to help Indonesia and that this requires that the
circumstances exist which enable economic agreements to work,''
Roth said.
	   He said this meant ``a resolution of the political situation so
that the economic agreements with the IMF and the assistance
provided either bilaterally or multilaterally can be most
effective.''
	   Habibie came to power on May 21 when former President Suharto
stepped down, ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto quit after Indonesia was hit by a wave of riots and
protests, sparked by the worst economic crisis in 32 years.
	   During his short time in office Habibie has promised to work
with the IMF while reforming the tightly controlled political
system. He plans to hold elections in 1999.
	   ``We have been consistent in our support of political process
through dialogue and in support of a peaceful process, one that
results in a resolution of the political crisis and one that will
facilitate the environment that is needed in order for Indonesia's
economic recovery,'' Roth said.
	   Last week the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific Affairs Hubert
Neiss held meetings with Habibie, Cabinet ministers and opposition
figures following the May 21 resignation of former leader, Suharto.
	   Neiss reported on his visit to the IMF's management and
executive board in Washington on Monday.
	   IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said this week that
IMF funding should resume _ if all goes reasonably well _ soon
after the review team winds up its mission in Jakarta.
	   Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's economic woes. Its
currency has plummeted while inflation and unemployment have
soared.
	   The economy is expected to contract at least 10 percent this
year _ compared with the 5 percent shrinkage predicted by the
government in March.

Federal police say Swiss couple arrested in German construction
</HEADLINE>
tycoon case  

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ Police in Miami, Florida arrested a
Swiss couple on suspicion of obstruction of justice for helping a
bankrupt German construction tycoon flee and hide near Miami in
1994, German federal police said Thursday.
	   German federal authorities in Wiesbaden said in a statement they
aided local police in apprehending the couple, who were not
identified by name, on Wednesday outside of a Miami Beach building,
where they owned an apartment.
	   The statement said the 57-year-old Swiss man also has Canadian
and Egyptian citizenship, and that he and his wife had been sought
since 1996 for helping construction tycoon Juergen Schneider and
his wife flee Germany and hide in the United States.
	   Schneider and his wife, Claudia, fled Germany in April 1994,
when his company was forced into bankruptcy. They were arrested in
Miami in May 1995 and extradited to Germany in February 1996.
	   The federal police statement said the Swiss couple are to appear
before a magistrate in Miami on Thursday, and that Frankfurt
prosecutors were preparing documents for an extradition hearing.
	   Frankfurt prosecutors were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Schneider, 63, was convicted on five counts of serious fraud for
falsifying documents to convince banks his properties were worth
much more than their true value to obtain huge loans. He was
sentenced to six years and nine months in prison by a Frankfurt
court in December.
	   Schneider's concern collapsed with 5 billion marks (dlrs 2.8
billion) in debt, nearly one-third of it with Deutsche Bank, his
main creditor.

Bank chief says Thai economy will be OK if baht falls to 45
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with final baht rate; bond repurchase rate raised, 3rd
graf

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor
claimed Thursday that economic prospects will suffer little even if
the currency keeps sliding to 45 to the U.S. dollar amid fears of a
worsening regional recession.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul spoke to reporters as the baht, which had
been stable for several weeks at about 39 to the dollar, closed at
42.45 trading from 42.20 at Wednesday's close.
	   The currency strengthened from 43 earlier in the day after the
Bank of Thailand raised its bond repurchase rate for the second
time this week, from 18 percent to 19 percent.
	   ``If the baht is traded between 40 baht and 45 baht, our economy
will be able to handle it,'' Chatu Mongkol said. ``It is OK for the
exchange rate to move, as long as it doesn't move too quickly.''
	   The currency has been weakening since last week when Thailand
and the International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a dlrs
17.2 billion bailout of the economy, agreed that the country's
recession would be deeper and longer than previously thought.
	   The economy is now expected to shrink as much as 5.5 percent in
1998, compared to 3.5 percent thought previously.
	   The baht has lost some 40 percent of its value since it was
floated 11 months ago following a failed defense against currency
speculation. The move triggered a regional economic meltdown.
	   Thai share prices ended 1.8 percent higher Thursday after the
Bank of Thailand announced details of a debt restructuring plan
that will allow banks to set aside smaller reserves, encouraging
talks with borrowers on whittling down problem loans.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index closed up 5.60 points to
318.81.
	   Worry that the continuing slump will spark a new crisis has
prompted Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda to plan a trip to
the United States, his office said Thursday.
	   Details have yet to be confirmed, but the Bangkok Post reported
Tarrin planned to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus.
	   The report said that Tarrin would seek assurances of assistance
in case Thailand had to face increased obligations due to currency
fluctuations and an outflow of funds.

Casanova's fans mark anniversary of his death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Even in death, Casanova can still
reel them in.
	   Fans of the infamous womanizer, whose full name was Giovanni
Giacomo Casanova, gathered Thursday in the Czech town of Duchcov to
mark the 200th anniversary of his death.
	   Women and men alike have been pouring by the hundreds into the
Duchcov Castle, where the world's most renowned lover spent the
last 13 years of his life, to take part in a four-day program of
cultural and social events devoted to Casanova's life.
	   ``We've even had several package tours from abroad,'' including
several busloads from Italy, said Tatjana Badriasvili, an employee
at the castle 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Prague.
	   The castle is hosting an exhibition entitled ``Erotics in
Today's Art,'' and another called ``Casanova's Europe,'' opened
Thursday by the Italian ambassador to the Czech Republic, Maurizio
Moreno.
	   Casanova's fans can also lay wreaths at his original grave in
the graveyard of Duchov's Saint Barbara's church.
	   Casanova, who boasted of having more than a hundred lovers, was
buried at the Duchov graveyard after he died in 1798 but later was
exhumed and reburied at an unknown location.
	   A tombstone still commemorates his original grave.

Assad to release more prisoners, human rights group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Under pressure from human rights groups,
Syrian President Hafez Assad is planning to release more political
prisoners and activists, some of them in prison for three decades,
a human rights group said Thursday.
	   Earlier this week Assad has reportedly released some 30
political prisoners and human rights activists jailed for opposing
the regime.
	   But Haitham Mana, spokesman for the exiled Organization of
Defense Committees for Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in
Syria, said his group has received assurances from Assad that more
prisoners will be released soon.
	   ``President Assad has sent us his word that some 100 political
prisoners will be released, probably next week,'' Mana told The
Associated Press by telephone from his Paris headquarters. He said
Assad's pledge came through a presidential aide who visited France.
	   Leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar reported Thursday that 225
prisoners had been released in the past few days. The paper said
among the released were human rights activists, communists and
Muslim fundamentalists.
	   It was not clear if those who had been freed were the same
people whose promised release Mana referred to. The paper said that
only 30 among those let go were people whose freedom had been
demanded by human rights groups.
	   Syria quietly freed scores of political detainees in 1995,
including those who took part in a 1982 revolt by Muslim
fundamentalists against President Hafez Assad's rule.
	   An-Nahar quoted Syrian sources as saying that ``Assad gave his
orders for the release of a new batch'' of prisoners who carried
out attacks in the early 1980's because their prison terms have
ended.
	   Mana said the promise for the release came after the group
threatened a widespread campaign against Assad ahead of his planned
visit to France in the summer.
	   Syria is still believed to hold some 2,500 political prisoners
including two who have been in jail for nearly 28 years. Khalil
Berayez and Moustafa Falah were imprisoned immediately after Assad
came to power in a military coup in September 1970.

Autopsy study shows heart damage starts early in life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Autopsies performed on young people show that the
same risk factors that lead to heart disease in adulthood begin to
take their toll early in life.
	   The study, conducted by Dr. Gerald S. Berenson of Tulane
University, looked at the early stages of atherosclerosis _ a
buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries _ in 93 people ages 2 to
39 who had died from a variety of causes, mostly accidents.
	   The research found that the more risk factors youngsters have,
the greater this buildup in the coronary arteries, a condition that
eventually contributes to heart attacks.
	   Adults' risk of heart attacks increases when they have high
blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity, among other things.
In the new study, doctors looked for fatty streaks _ the earliest
stage of damage _ as well as clogging buildups of plaque in the
youngsters' heart arteries.
	   In youngsters with no risk factors, 1 percent of the surface of
their coronary arteries was covered with fatty streaks. This rose
to 3 percent for those with two risk factors, 8 percent for those
with three and 11 percent for those with four.
	   The results were based on the Bogalusa Heart Study, which has
followed young people's cardiovascular health in Louisiana since
1973. The findings were published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   ``The issue assumes particular importance in the light of the
troubling recent trends in the health profile of U.S.
adolescents,'' such as smoking, obesity and lack of exercise, Dr.
J. Michael Gaziano of Harvard Medical School said in an editorial.

Indonesian economics minister promises cleaner investment climate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia will emerge from its current
financial crisis with a ``much cleaner'' investment climate
following sweeping reforms, its senior economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said THursday.
	   Ginandjar, in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, promised to
end the time-consuming procedures and ``arbitrary'' decisions that
characterized Jakarta's handling of foreign and local investment
proposals under former President Suharto, who quit last month after
32 years in power.
	   Critics have accused Suharto and his family of using their power
and position to amass billions of dollars and to build huge
business empires.
	   The government has announced a broad investigation into state
corruption. But many also want the state to seize Suharto's assets
help Indonesia battle the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Ginandjar, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for the Economy,
Finance and Industry, cautioned against a ``witch hunt'' aimed at
Suharto, warning that emotion-driven demands for financial
retribution from the Suharto family could frighten off would-be
investors.
	   ``We need to avoid that kind of witch hunt because it would only
create further uncertainty,`` said Ginandjar, a former Suharto
minister. ``The government must take the initiative to get this
matter settled through the right channels and not let things get
out of hand.''
	   Last week, Indonesia announced that it would change investment
rules in an effort to attract desperately needed capital to its
moribund economy, which is expected to contract by at least 10
percent in 1998.
	   ``At the heart of the present crisis is the lack of confidence
that has hindered investment, so we're trying to show that we're
serious about reforming the economy,'' said Ginandjar. ``One way is
to liberalize the investment regime.''
	   Ginandjar said Jakarta will cut red tape by permitting foreign
investments valued at dlrs 100 million or less to be approved
directly by the Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board. In the
past, such investments needed final approval from the president.
Investment proposals exceeding dlrs 100 million in value will still
require presidential approval, however.
	   The proposed new investment rules will also decentralize power
by letting local authorities approve domestic investments of 10
billion rupiah or less. New President B.J. Habibie is expected to
issue a decree soon formalizing the new investment rules.
	   ``It will be a much cleaner investment climate than in the
past,'' Ginandjar said, contending that the liberalized application
procedure will reduce costs and get projects underway more quickly.
	   Indonesian industries are also struggling to cope with heavy
debts, a currency that has depreciated by almost 80 percent since
July and weak domestic demand. The banking system is near collapse;
lending activity has all but ceased as interest rates have rocketed
to more than 60 percent.

Russian government challenges law restricting foreign ownership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government filed a challenge Thursday
to a law recently passed by the Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament that limits foreign ownership in electric companies,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The law aims to restrict foreign influence over the electricity
monopoly, RAO Unified Energy System, and other state-owned
electricity companies.
	   The government appealed to the Constitutional Court to amend the
law, which sets a cap on foreign ownership at 25 percent of share
capital.
	   Foreign investors currently own about 30 percent of UES, and the
law has been cited as one reason contributing to the present
instability in Russian markets.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and UES chief executive Anatoly
Chubais have vowed to defend shareholders' rights.

Germany vows to go ahead with Holocaust monument
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Eisenman in graf 3, description of
monument in graf 4  

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German government said the withdrawal
of American sculptor Richard Serra from a design competition for a
new Holocaust memorial in Berlin would not stop the project from
going ahead.
	   Serra, who collaborated on a monument design with New York-based
architect Peter Eisenman, wrote to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
saying he was quitting for ``personal and professional reasons,''
government spokesman Otto Hauser said.
	   The design itself _ a cemetery-like ``field'' of 4,000 concrete
pillars _ has not been withdrawn. It is one of four finalists for
the project slated for construction in 1999.
	   Officials have delayed announcing a winner, although the
Serra-Eisenman design is favored by Kohl. The two men met with the
chancellor in May, however details of the meeting were not
disclosed.
	   Serra told Kohl in the letter that he hoped the project would go
ahead, Hauser said.
	   Both the Berlin Senate cultural administrators and the state
stressed that oft-delayed project would not be affected by Serra's
decision.
	   ``The German government remains of the opinion that the monument
for the murdered Jews of Europe should be built on the piece of
land allocated for it in Berlin,'' Hauser said.
	   Eisenman told the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel that he
``understood'' Serra and respected his decision for leaving, but
that he was committed to the design.
	   An initial design winner in 1996 _ a massive concrete slab
engraved with the names of Holocaust survivors _ was rejected as
monumental and offensive. And the second competition has been
controversial, too.

Doctors ask Supreme Court to declare tobacco `dangerous drug'
</HEADLINE>
  By DINA KRAFT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli doctors and former smokers suffering
from lung cancer and heart disease asked the Supreme Court on
Thursday to declare nicotine and tobacco dangerous drugs.
	   Such a declaration could force the hand of the Health Ministry
to impose new restrictions, such as barring the sale of cigarettes
to those under 18 and limiting imports.
	   The petition was filed by the Israeli Medical Association (IMI)
and 15 people suffering from smoking-related diseases.
	   Shlomo Erdman, a lawyer for IMI, said the high court was the
last resort after parliament has failed to take action. ``Because
of the economic interests posed by the tobacco companies we see the
Knesset is not dealing with the issue so we are turning to the
court to force the Health Ministry to take action,'' he said.
	   Citing medical research, Erdman said nicotine and tobacco are no
less addictive than heroine or cocaine and must be declared
dangerous drugs. He cited a similar declaration about cigarettes
and addiction by the U.S. Surgeon General in 1988.
	   Once such a classification is made, the Health Ministry would be
forced to clamp down on the production and marketing of cigarettes
and other tobacco products, Erdman said. One option would be to
reduce the number of cigarettes sold in Israel.
	   Health Ministry spokeswoman Dassi Tenenbaum said the ministry
would not comment until it has seen the petition.
	   According to the IMA, some 5,000 Israelis die every year from
smoking-related illnesses and the habit costs the economy over drls
500 million a year in lost work days and damage caused by fires
started by cigarettes.
	   Twenty-eight percent of Israel's nearly 6 million people smoke.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
accelerated their campaign Thursday against a South Asian arms race
threatened by the recent nuclear tests conducted by rival neighbors
India and Pakistan.
	   A diplomat close to the emergency meeting said China, Britain,
France, Russia and the United States _ also the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ planned to try to ``find a
formula for defusing the tension.''
	   ``They see their role as one facilitating a reduction of tension
in the subcontinent and to persuade India and Pakistan to sign up
to the global regime against nuclear proliferation,'' said the
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The five countries are best positioned to apply diplomatic
pressure on top of already-imposed economic sanctions. They also
are the only countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
permitted to have nuclear stockpiles _ a situation that has long
irked India. Neither India nor Pakistan has signed the treaty.
	   The meeting's chairman, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
fears testing by India and Pakistan could encourage more countries
to obtain nuclear weapons, Chinese officials said in Beijing.
However, Tang has ruled out joint sanctions against India and
Pakistan.
	   ``We should urge them with one voice and make them realize it's
not in their interest,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan nuclear power status without unraveling the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty negotiated in the late 1960s. They
are examining other ways of bringing them into global, step-by-step
disarmament efforts.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, in Geneva after
visiting India and Pakistan, told disarmament negotiators from
61countries Thursday that the ``lack of serious intention'' by the
five powers contributed to the arms race.
	   But he said he preferred ``to concentrate on the positive'' and
backed efforts to defuse the tensions.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   The Iranians did not plan to meet with the five original nuclear
states' ministers, he said.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. ``These two
countries are cheek-by-jowl.''
	   In Washington, a top official said Albright would seek common
ground among the five original nuclear powers but also would not
urge joint sanctions because that could be counterproductive.
	   ``We want to defuse the current tensions,'' Karl F. Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, told a U.S.
Senate hearing.

Hezbollah distances itself from Marine bombing but praises attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Seeking to shed its violent past,
Hezbollah has claimed it had n link to the 1983 U.S. Marine
bombing, saying the suicide attack that killed 241 Americans was
carried out by an ``independent'' group.
	   However, group chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah wholeheartedly
supported the suicide attack.
	   It's always been strongly suspected that the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah were behind the bombings of the Marines and two U.S.
Embassy buildings as well as the kidnapping of 90 foreigners,
including 17 Americans, during the 1980s in Lebanon.
	   Shadowy pro-Iranian groups, which claimed responsibility for
most of the acts, were believed to have operated under Hezbollah's
umbrella, using cover names to thwart any would-be American
retaliation.
	   Nasrallah denied any link to the violent acts in a television
interview Wednesday night.
	   ``Hezbollah has nothing to do with the kidnapping of foreigners
or the Marine operation,'' Nasrallah told the private Murr TV
station.
	   Asked who carried out the bombing of the Marines at Beirut
airport on Oct. 23, 1983, Nasrallah said: ``a group that is
completely independent from Hezbollah.'' He did not name the group.
	   He said he supported the attack because of American support for
Israel.
	   ``Frankly, I bless those who bombed the Marine headquarters ...
We wished it was Hezbollah who carried it out,'' he said.
	   Hezbollah, under the Nasrallah's moderate leadership, has
transformed itself into a mainstream movement championing social
and economic issues and waging a guerrilla war on Israeli forces in
southern Lebanon.
	   But the U.S. State Department insists that Hezbollah still
engages in terrorism.

Chinese official denies church torn down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese religious official denied Thursday that
local authorities tore down a Catholic church, saying the razed
building was not a church.
	   A letter purportedly from China and given to the
Washington-based rights advocacy group Freedom House said more than
130 police and Communist Party officials raided the church in
southeastern Fujian province's Houlu village on May 9.
	   The raiding party injured three women who were dragged from the
church and handcuffed, Freedom House's account of the letter said.
It added that the authorities razed the 600-square-foot
(54-square-meter) church within two hours, despite the pleas of
members of the congregation.
	   Chen Cheng, a spokesman for the Fujian government's Religious
Affairs Bureau, said no one had ever applied for a permit to build
the structure, violating national land protection laws.
	   Local residents reported the violation to the authorities and
there was no confrontation or injuries when they came to tear the
building down, Chen said.
	   He said the building stood next to a church, which was
unscathed. He said he did not know who built it or used it, but
said it had no connection to the church.
	   ``We believe the relevant authorities have handled this in a
normal and legal manner,'' Chen said.
	   China bans religious services and studies outside facilities
controlled by government-approved Catholic and Protestant churches.
Local authorities have frequently shut down underground churches
and jailed worshipers or clergy.

Bank of England surprises markets with interest rate increase
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS comment from business leaders, political opposition,
adding byline; no pickup  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England raised interest rates by a
quarter-point Thursday, jolting unwary markets as it sought to slow
the economy so the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair
can finally hit its inflation target.
	   Most analysts in London had predicted the central bank would
hold rates steady because the economy appears to be cooling down on
its own. The bank instead raised its repo rate, the lowest rate at
which it lends money to commercial banks, to 7.50 percent from 7.25
percent.
	   London stock prices plunged on the news, amid fears the higher
interest rates will raise the value of the British pound, making
British exports even less competitive in global markets. By early
afternoon, the blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was off by 65.5 points, or 1.1 percent, at 5,832.9.
	   The strong pound already has hurt earnings at most British
multinationals and stirred fears that manufacturers in particular
are slipping into recession. But even though many British
businesses are facing tough times, consumer spending is booming,
pushing prices higher in an economy that seems out of balance.
	   Inflation rose to a six-year high of 4 percent in April,
illustrating the government's inability to keep price rises within
the stated target of 2.5 percent. Inflation has exceeded the target
in 10 of the past 11 months.
	   The latest rate rise was the sixth since Blair's government took
office in May 1997.
	   British homeowners braced for higher mortgage payments and
corporate lobbyists lashed out at what they called an unwarranted
rate hike that will raise the costs of doing business.
	   At the British Chambers of Commerce, deputy director Ian Peters
lamented ``a rate rise too far.''
	   ``Recent forecasts have suggested that the U.K. economy was set
for a soft landing,'' Peters said. ``Today's decision will mean
that many businesses will now face a rougher ride and it increases
the serious problems facing our exporters.''
	   Britain's top Treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown, rocked the nation's monetary structure almost
immediately after taking office last year when he gave the Bank of
England power to set interest rates on its own. His political foes
have been critical ever since.
	   Previously, British chancellors had set rates.
	   At the Liberal Democrat party, Britain's third largest, lawmaker
Edward Davey accused Brown of creating ``the Jekyll and Hyde
economy _ a booming consumer sector and a busting manufacturing
sector.''
	   ``The Bank of England has been struggling to deal with this
through an interest rate policy which simply cannot be set to deal
with the different problems of both sectors simultaneously,'' said
Davey, who serves as the Liberal Democrats' spokesman on Treasury
matters.

China, South Korea play to 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>
  With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ World Cup-bound South Korea played to
a 1-1 draw against China on Thursday in a tough warm-up match that
sent one of its key players off the field with injury.
	   Midfielder Lee Sang-yoon scored South Korea's first goal in the
16th minute when he dribbled through two Chinese defenders and
fired the ball past goalkeeper Jiang Jin.
	   China's Ma Mingyu equalized the goal in the 52nd minute, firing
from just outside the penalty area and narrowly beating South
Korean goalie Kim Byung-ji.
	   Both sides played aggressive soccer. South Korean star forward
Hwang Sun-hong was carried off the field on the stretchers after
colliding with the Chinese goalie in the 20th minute.
	   South Korean coach Cha Bum-keun said Hwang was under treatment
in hospital for a knee injury but refused to five further details.
	   Hwang, South Korea's most prolific scorer, retuned to the
national team in April after a two-year break due to a knee injury.
	   South Korea dominated the first half but the Chinese shifted to
higher gear in the second half, taking advantage of an occasional
disarray in the South Korean defense.
	   But goalie Kim successfully smothered several powerful shots in
the second half.
	   South Korea plays Belgium, Mexico and the Netherlands in the
first round at the World Cup in France. Thursday's match was South
Korea's last tune-up before it flies to Paris on Friday.
	   China did not qualify for the World Cup finals.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thirteen North Korean fishing boats were released
from Russian custody Thursday, four days after they were detained
for poaching fish in Russian territorial waters in the Far East,
news agencies reported.
	   Russia fined the boats' operators dlrs 15,380, Interfax
reported. Russian border authorities said the boats, seized off the
southernmost tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula, were carrying 180 tons
of fish and other seafood.
	   Russia has had repeated run-ins with Japanese fishing boats in
disputed waters surrounding the Kuril Islands, and Chinese poachers
in waters dividing the two countries, but apparently few cases
involving North Koreans.
	   North Korea is suffering from a serious famine, but tight border
controls usually make it difficult for boats to leave its
territory.

Tutu says Botha has been humiliated in trial
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL HARRIS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former President P.W. Botha came out
the loser by refusing to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, panel chairman Desmond Tutu testified Thursday.
	   The retired Anglican archbishop was the latest witness to
testify against the last hard-line leader of white rule who, as he
has done throughout his trial, looked on impassively.
	   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
activities, said Botha had humiliated himself by facing criminal
charges in court instead of complying with a subpoena to testify
before the Truth Commission.
	   ``The humiliation is the accused sitting here and I sought to
spare him that,'' Tutu said.
	   Botha has called the commission ``a circus,'' claiming it is
victimizing him by wanting him to appear in person when he has
submitted more than 1,700 pages of written answers to commission
questions.
	   Botha, 82, is being tried for contempt for snubbing the Truth
Commission. He faces up to two years in prison and unspecified
fines if convicted.
	   Earlier, apartheid's most notorious killer, ex-police death
squad commander Eugene de Kock, testified that he believed the
murders and bombings he carried in defense of apartheid had been
sanctioned from the highest levels.
	   De Kock is serving a 212-years prison sentence for his crimes.
He called his former political bosses cowards who had sold out the
footsoldiers who carried out their dirty work.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the African National Congress, which had
been waging a guerrilla campaign against apartheid.
	   The talks culminated in all-race elections in 1994, which the
ANC won.

Tens of thousands left homeless by Kosovo fighting

  With Albania-Kosovo Refugees; Yugoslavia-Another War?
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are still hiding in forests hoping to escape,
reports said Thursday.
	   In neighboring Albania, where refugees continued pouring in,
officials pleaded again for international assistance. About 12,000
refugees have arrived since last weekend, they said.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   The Albanian-language daily Bujku reported Thursday said
thousands are headed toward the border with Albania, Europe's
poorest country.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled into Montenegro, the other
republic left in what remains of Yugoslavia besides Serbia,
officials there said.
	   The United Nations refugee agency says 40,000 people in Kosovo
have fled their homes for nearby Albania, Montenegro or elsewhere
in Kosovo as Serb forces increase efforts to crush militants in the
Serb-ruled province, where the population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   But that figure is growing fast, and others say it is a
conservative estimate. Ethnic Albanian officials in Kosovo claim
50,000 people have been displaced since the start of an earlier
crackdown in March.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center in Kosovo said one man was killed when
a Yugoslav army border patrol fired on an armed group trying to
cross over illegally from Albania.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory. Dozens have been killed since an intensive
campaign began last week, and several villages are reportedly in
ruins.
	   Veljko Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo,
denied a war is taking place.
	   ``What this is all about is an increase in terrorist activity,
and it's our legitimate right to fight against terrorism,'' he
said. ``All our actions are defensive in character. We are simply
responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for
numerous deadly attacks on Serb police.
	   In response to growing concerns the Serbs are carrying out a
strategy of forced expulsions of entire villages, Odalovic claimed
ethnic Albanians have ``cleansed entire villages of their Serb
populations.''
	   In the provincial capital of Pristina on Thursday, there was
evidence of the militants' growing popularity as more than 10,000
ethnic Albanians flooded the main street to protest the Serb
violence.
	   The crowd, comprised mostly of young people, chanted ``U-C-K'' _
Albanian-language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army. Some
carried placards reading ``NATO help save Kosovo.''
	   Unlike in the past, no one chanted ``Rugova'' _ indicating
declining support for the ethnic Albanians' long-time leader
Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist approach has failed to bring
results.
	   Recent talks between Rugova and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who is behind the crackdown, are all but dead as a
result of the new offensive.
	   Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian politician,
acknowledged Rugova has no influence over the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which ``does not want to hear of him.''
	   Western officials are debating whether to send in troops or
impose new sanctions against Yugoslavia. But the West is reluctant
to commit a huge military contingent to the region, with 34,000
troops already in neighboring Bosnia.

Dissidents, disgraced reformer watched on Tiananmen anniversary

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police warned a former senior Communist Party
reformist jailed after 1989 democracy protests to stay silent and
kept a tight watch in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Thursday, the
ninth anniversary of the student-led movement's violent end.
	   About two dozen dissidents were detained nationwide and others
reported tighter surveillance. Plainclothes police patrolled
Tiananmen Square with two-way radios and binoculars, and soldiers
armed with assault rifles drilled nearby.
	   A few mourners discreetly commemorated the military assault that
left hundreds, if not thousands, dead.
	   Bao Tong, who spent nearly eight years in custody as the highest
level party member jailed in the crackdown, recently publicly urged
the party to enact democratic reforms. On Thursday, he said he had
been told not to speak to foreign reporters.
	   Ever since the June 4, 1989, military assault that ended the
protests, Chinese leaders have feared the anniversary might be used
to rally opposition.
	   Police quickly grabbed two men, one in a wheelchair, who threw
leaflets in the air near an obelisk called the Monument to the
People's Heroes at the heart of the vast square. The leaflets
demanded compensation for a crippling shooting accident and were
unrelated to the anniversary.
	   A group of five men who as college students participated in the
1989 protests said they had come to the square every year since to
commemorate those who died. One was dressed in white, the
traditional color of mourning in China.
	   The group stood quietly without attracting police attention.
	   ``We won't welcome President Clinton to China. He's got his
human rights and economic policies mixed up,'' said the young man
dressed in white.
	   The authorities recently tightened the house arrest of former
party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Zhao, who was ousted for
appearing sympathetic to the protesters' demands in 1989, now must
get top-level permission to take walks or visit friends, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported Thursday.
	   Bao, a top aide to Zhao, was arrested May 28, 1989, apparently
for leaking word that party conservatives planned to crush the
protests. He spent seven years in jail and 11 months in detention
and returned home in April 1997. His probation recently ended.
	   ``My goal is to be a very good Chinese citizen, a Chinese
citizen with the right to speak his mind,'' The Washington Post
quoted Bao as saying. ``I believe my freedom of speech will be
protected by law and by the government.''
	   A day after the article was published, Bao said he had been told
such interviews were forbidden under rules _ enforced arbitrarily _
that require foreign reporters to get official permission for
interviews with Chinese.
	   ``I am extremely, extremely sorry. Although under Chinese law I
am supposed to have freedom of speech and I am very willing to
express myself frankly, I am not willing to see you have any
trouble,'' Bao said in a telephone interview.

Iraq says the UN has no evidence that it still has banned weapons
</HEADLINE>
  By LEON BARKHO  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have no evidence that Iraq
still possesses illegal arms, Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed
Rashid said Thursday.
	   ``If they have information (about weapons) let them give it to
us. We will verify it,'' Lt. Gen. Rashid told The Associated Press
in an interview.
	   The minister spoke hours after the chief weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, presented a report with charts and aerial
photographs to the U.N. Security Council. Butler argued the Baghdad
government had failed to come clean about its weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles.
	   The Security Council has said Iraq must eliminate all such
weapons before it will lift the sweeping sanctions imposed after
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rashid accused Butler of acting in bad faith. For the U.N.
inspectors, ``it does not matter whether it is right or wrong. What
is important is to create doubts ... to block the lifting of
sanctions,'' he said.
	   He also said the inspector's program was orchestrated by the
United States, which with Britain has insisted that Iraq comply
fully with Security Council resolutions on its disarmament. The
other permanent members of the council _ Russia, France and China _
favor a speedy end to the sanctions, which virtually ban trade with
Iraq and have devastated the country's economy.
	   ``The area for maneuver for the American administration and its
front organization, that is the (U.N.) special commission (on
disarmament), has become very limited. They have run out of
games,'' said Rashid, a former chairman of Iraq's Military
Organization Commission.
	   Rashid reiterated that Iraq has nothing left to hide and said
the government would continue to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   A U.N. team is currently searching for parts of destroyed
missiles to verify Iraq's claim that it has scrapped all its
biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   Rashid said the inspectors know that Iraq has no more missile
launchers or engines.
	   ``What is the importance of a warhead? If you do not have an
engine or a launcher you have no missile,'' he said.

Mahathir criticizes West, warns about high interest rates
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Mahathir comments on nuclear tests  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad lashed
out at governments and companies of the West on Thursday, accusing
them of trying to exploit Asian economies to enrich themselves.
	   In a speech delivered at a symposium here, Mahathir said ``there
is not going to be much of a future for Asia, at least a future
that is distinctly Asian.''
	   Mahathir has been critical of international bailouts of Asian
economies led by the International Monetary Fund and has blamed the
World Bank body for being insensitive to Asian people.
	   Noting that one of the International Monetary Fund's
prescriptions for struggling economies was to tighten monetary
policy, Mahathir said, ``When the interest rate is increased and
credit is pulled back, the task of making additional profit is made
quite impossible.
	   ``Between the currency and share devaluation and the interest
rate increase and credit squeeze, most of the nations' companies
will go bankrupt,'' he said.
	   He suggested that Western countries were contributing to the IMF
bailouts not out of concern for the people of the region but to
strengthen their own companies.
	   ``Ugly capitalism seems to be at the back of this humanitarian
concern. It is not humane at all as the consequences of this demand
is to make the peoples of these countries poorer, not richer.''
	   He warned that Asians might soon rise up in protest against
perceived exploitation by countries western capitalists.
	   ``Sooner or later they will think of regaining control over
their economies, '' he said, adding that ``violence must come.''
	   Asked about the leadership change in Indonesia, Mahathir said
``Mere change in government doesn't mean anything if other things
are not there.''
	   He added that a quick resumption of IMF funding to Indonesia
will be necessary to help Indonesia restore stability.
	   Mahathir also criticized world nuclear powers for condemning
India and Pakistan's recent nuclear tests while possessing nuclear
weapons themselves, the Malaysian news service Bernama reported.
	   ``I know there are countries with nuclear capabilities who have
not really been slapped on the hand and yet they make a big show
over the tests undertaken by the two South Asian countries,''
Mahathir was quoted as saying, days after criticizing the tests
himself.
	   ``Let's apply sanctions to all nuclear countries.''

Dozens of would-be immigrants from North Africa detained off
</HEADLINE>
Spanish coast  

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ The coast guard intercepted two boats
carrying 44 would-be immigrants in the Strait of Gibraltar early
Thursday as they approached the southern Spanish coast, police
said.
	   Radar alerted the coast guard in the port of Algeciras to the
presence of a makeshift boat carrying 25 men and two women from
North Africa, police spokeswoman Amelia Garcia said.
	   Three hours later, the coast guard arrested 17 men in the same
area who were traveling in a boat transporting 15 kilograms (33
pounds) of hashish.
	   Poverty and unemployment in North Africa lead thousands to seek
a better life in Europe every year. Spain serves as a major entry
point because the Strait of Gibraltar that separates it from
Morocco is as narrow as 12 miles (20 kilometers) in some places.
	   Spanish police say there has been a notable increase in recent
months of the number of would-be immigrants attempting to make the
potentially dangerous crossing.

For the first time under Chinese rule, Hong Kong recalls June 4

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In their first such ceremony under Chinese
rule, tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered despite in
heavy rain Thursday to mourn the victims of the Tiananmen Square
massacre nine years ago.
	   Even though Beijing has kept hands off of Hong Kong since
reassuming sovereignty last July 1, those who came to the
candlelight vigil said it was important to remember the students
who died, and to ensure that their own rights don't erode.
	   There was no police interference as about 40,000 people
converged at downtown Victoria Park. Beijing kept a close watch for
protests on the mainland, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the
Chinese government was not concerned about the Hong Kong protest.
	   The gathering was held against a backdrop proclaiming, ``Reverse
the June 4 verdict,'' a reference to Beijing's condemnation of the
1989 student movement as counter-revolutionary and subversive.
	   Wang Dan, a leader of the protest that was crushed by the army,
was to speak by telephone hookup from the United States, where he
was sent after his release from a Chinese prison in April.
	   ``We must all work together so that the democracy movement in
the mainland will move forward faster,'' Wang said in a statement
distributed by organizers prior to the vigil. ``On the day the June
4 verdict is overturned, Hong Kong people can go back to the
motherland and together we can finally see the victory and hear the
cheers.''
	   The crowd sang songs from the 1989 student movement. Placards
placed in the park proclaimed: ``Fight to the end.'' A fire was lit
on stage.
	   Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party that is pushing for
more democracy in Hong Kong, said he was pleased with the turnout,
and found the Foreign Ministry statement ``much more positive''
than previous ones.
	   ``I never thought the rain could dampen the flame of the Hong
Kong people,'' he said.
	   High school math teacher Fung Tak Wah, 40, said it was the ninth
time he took part in Hong Kong's Tiananmen vigil.
	   ``I was sad to see the students being killed, not only because I
am a teacher or because I am Chinese, but because I am human,
too,'' he said.
	   Anthony Hung, a 19-year-old student, said Hong Kong residents
must guard their rights.
	   ``If we don't stand up and defend our rights, the Chinese
government may take it away someday, before we know it,'' he said.
	   However, it was clear that Hong Kong generally was less worried
about its return to Chinese rule than it was last June 4, less than
a month before the handover that ended more than 140 years of
British rule. About 55,000 people turned out for last year's rally.
	   Although there are some worries about erosion of the rule of law
in Hong Kong, Beijing generally is regarded as having kept its
pledge to allow Hong Kong to keep its own system and run its own
affairs.
	   Instead, Hong Kong's chief concern is its faltering economy,
which is sliding into recession.

Alcatel chief says DSC buy complements U.S. Telecom Activity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alcatel Alsthom announced Thursday it has agreed to
buy Dallas-based DSC Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4.4 billion
share swap aimed at giving vitality to U.S. operations.
	   Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman and chief executive officer,
told journalists that Alcatel would have to issue 20 million new
shares, or approximately 12 percent of its capital due to the
transaction.
	   The acquisition will complement its U.S. telecommunications
network business and give Alcatel a jump-start in the networking
activities it has been interested in pursuing, Tchuruk said.
	   Alcatel shares fell 52 francs (dlrs 5.60), or 4 percent, to
1,250 francs (dlrs 134) on the news.
	   DCS specializes in certain aspects of fixed access systems such
as fixed line switches and transit switches, and also produces
local mobile switches as well as so-called intelligent networks.
	   Alcatel's U.S. operation focuses on transmission and has a
developing local access ADSL business.
	   ``We believe that DCS brings us what we are lacking,'' Tchuruk
said.
	   He said that while the group is not looking to acquire companies
in order to access technology, ``what we are lacking today is a
significant base to put into use these technologies.''
	   Combined, DCS and Alcatel will have estimated 1998 sales of dlrs
4.5 billion. Tchuruk expects annual cost savings of dlrs 200
million, with 60 percent of that to be realized in 1999 and 90
percent to be realized in the year 2000.

Dozens sickened by food poisoning at Russian party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One-quarter of the 120 guests who attended a
farewell party for conscripts in southern Russia were stricken with
food poisoning, a news agency said Thursday.
	   Doctors in the Stavropol region initially thought the
party-goers were suffering from vodka poisoning, Interfax said.
	   They changed their mind when five children became ill, and now
believe that some of the food served was not properly refrigerated,
it said.
	   Thirty-two of the guests have been hospitalized in the town of
Novoselitskoye, and some are seriously ill, said Vladimir
Yerofeyev, head doctor at the local medical center.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Kosovo
residents have been left homeless by fighting in the secessionist
province, and many are still hiding in forests hoping to escape.
	   As the refugee exodus into neighboring Albania continued
Thursday, officials in that country again pleaded for international
assistance to help deal with the crisis. About 12,000 people from
Kosovo have arrived in Albania since last weekend, they said.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a letter
to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana released Thursday.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, the other republic left in what remains of
Yugoslavia besides Serbia, officials there said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency said 40,000 people in Kosovo have fled
their homes in the face of the campaign by Serb forces to crush
militants in Kosovo _ to Albania, Montenegro or elsewhere in
Kosovo.
	   But that figure is growing fast, and others say it is a
conservative estimate. U.N. spokeswoman Judith Kumin in Geneva said
the flow was continuing at the border Thursday.
	   Many are still on the run within Kosovo, a Serb-ruled province
where the population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   TV Tirana estimated late Wednesday that 50,000 people are
``waiting, hiding in the woods, mountains and hills close to the
border'' and trying to get into Albania, Europe's poorest country,
which already is feeling the strain of the refugee crush.

Prince Edward reviews military veterans _ to his surprise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Edward expressed surprise Thursday at being
asked to review a parade of some of Britain's oldest and bravest
veterans: Most famously, he quit the Royal Marines more than a
decade ago.
	   In presiding over the Founder's Day parade for the first time,
the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II was following in the
footsteps of other members of the royal family, whose male members
usually wear military uniform for the occasion. Edward wore a
morning suit instead, though he went without the traditional top
hat.
	   Thanking the nearly 200 veterans for the invitation, Edward, now
a film producer, told them: ``I am not too sure who was probably
more surprised _ you or me.''
	   Later, the prince was defended by another Edward _ 78-year-old
Sgt. Maj. Edward Reynolds, who fought behind the lines in Burma,
one of the most dangerous postings in World War II.
	   ``Obviously, his reference to being surprised was because he
came out of the Marines,'' Reynolds said. ``But it was better to
come out than stay in and be miserable. It must have taken a lot of
guts. There aren't many people who would have done that.''

Japan's Mitsui Wharf applies for court protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Mitsui Wharf Co. applied to the Yokohama
District Court on Thursday for protection from creditors as it
restructures, private credit research agency Tokyo Shoko Research
said.
	   The port-harbor transport company, listed on the second section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has outstanding debts of about 22.1
billion (dlrs 160 million), TSR said.
	   Company and court officials could not be reached for comment
late Thursday.
	   On May 1, Mitsui Wharf said it was the victim of fraud by
several employees who may have counterfeited more than 3 billion
yen (dlrs 21.7 million) worth of promissory notes in the company's
name, including notes that were dishonored by banks.
	   Last week, Mitsui Wharf said that in the fiscal year ended March
31, it suffered a parent net loss of 6.38 billion yen (dlrs 46.2
million) as it accumulated reserves against loans to group
companies that it was unlikely to recover.
	   Mitsui Wharf is a member of the Taiyo Electric group of
companies. Its main shareholders are Sanshin Industries Co. and
Taiyo Electric Co, two unlisted companies. Its main banks are Tokyo
Sowa Bank Ltd. and Sakura Bank Ltd.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, fresh
from a visit to rival neighbors India and Pakistan, said Thursday
that it is crucial how the five original nuclear powers react to
the recent nuclear testing by the two countries.
	   ``I think that pressure and sanctions are not going to be
helpful,'' Kharrazi told reporters hours before foreign ministers
of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States were to
convene an emergency meeting in Geneva. ``Concentrate on the
positive.''
	   Kharrazi said he believes bilateral talks between India and
Pakistan on security, nuclear issues and the disputed region of
Jammu and Kashmir would be a useful first step toward defusing
tension on the Asian subcontinent.
	   The United States is the only country among the five that has
imposed sanctions on both countries after their nuclear testing.
	   Sanctions wouldn't force either country to back down and no such
action could ``undo what has been done,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Last Monday in Islamabad, Kharrazi praised Pakistan's
development of an ``Islamic bomb'' as the Muslim world's first
defense against Israel's widely suspected nuclear arsenal.
	   ``The terminology of the `Islamic bomb' is meaningless,''
Kharrazi said Thursday. ``Islam has thoughts, and thoughts are not
exploding but spreading.''
	   In a speech Thursday to the Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament he said, ``This was one genie that was much better to
have stayed confined in a bottle.''
	   Removing restrictions on access to nuclear material for peaceful
means could be the key to persuading India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said.
	   Also, the five traditional nuclear powers bear partial
responsibility for the recent nuclear testing because of ``the
insufficiency and insignificance of the response to demands for
genuine moves on nuclear disarmament,'' he said.
	   If they are to be ``neutral and helpful in the cause of
nonproliferation,'' the five nuclear powers should address Israel's
nuclear capability, said Kharrazi, who also reiterated that Iran
has no nuclear weapons program.

Former apartheid gov't agent gets life in prison for murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A former apartheid government
agent was sentenced Thursday to two life prison terms for murdering
an opponent of white rule and a former business partner.
	   Ferdi Barnard, who wears his thinning brown hair to his
shoulders and whose long-time crack cocaine abuse make him appear
older than his 39 years, was also sentenced to 63 years'
imprisonment for attempting to murder another anti-apartheid
activist, Dullah Omar, in 1989.
	   After Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won South
Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, Omar was appointed
justice minister.
	   Barnard, already serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery,
told reporters he would follow Mandela's example and not provide
evidence against his former cohorts. Mandela spent 27 years in
prison for fighting apartheid.
	   ``When President Mandela got sentenced ... he didn't go the next
day and turn on all of his comrades. I'm going to take a page from
his book. I'm not going to turn on my friends. I'm just going to do
my time.''
	   Barnard received the sentences for shooting to death
anti-apartheid activist David Webster, who was a professor at
Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, in 1989 and beating to
death former business partner Mark Frances in 1991.
	   Frances was killed to prevent him from disclosing Barnard's
involvement in a robbery, prosecutors said.
	   Barnard is a former operative of the the now defunct Civil
Cooperation Bureau, an apartheid government unit that attacked
anti-apartheid groups.
	   The sentences are to run concurrently. Barnard can be considered
for parole when he's 65.
	   Judge Johan Els said Barnard was a danger to society, and the
court should ensure he does not endanger the community again.

BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia has threatened to launch an

<TEXT>
oust-government movement' if the opposition's planned long march
towards Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) on June 9 was blocked by the
government.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that we want to finish the long
march in a peaceful manner. But if the government takes any step to
fail the programme, a final movement will be launched to unseat the
government and the consequences will have to be borne by the
government,'' the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament said while
speaking at a council session of her party's front organisation in
the city on Wednesday.
	   The council session of the Dhaka city unit of Jatiyatabadi
Sechchhasebak Dal, a front organisation of the BNP was held on the
premises of the Engineers Institution on Wednesday and it was also
addressed, among others, by BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan, former Secretary General Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder,
MK Anwar, MP, Sadek Hossain Khoka, MP, Justice Habibul Islam
Bhuiyan, Amanullah Aman, MP, Barkatullah Bhulu, MP, Rizvi Ahmed,
Fazlul Haq Milon, Habibur Rahman Habib and Habibunnabi Sohel.
Besides, leaders of BNP's different front organisations also spoke
while the city unit convener Akhteruzzaman presided.
	   Begum Zia also hoisted the national flag and released baloons to
inaugurate the council session.
	   The former Prime Minister said the government was afraid of the
long march and it was planning to stop it. ``If the government
obstructs our programme, the long march will be just a beginning of
a non-stop anti-government agitation till the fall of the
government,'' she said.
	   Explaining the reason for calling long march towards the CHT,
the BNP Chairperson said that the long march would be organised to
express solidarity with the people of the hill region, who were
stripped of their fundamental rights and facing various problems
for what she termed unconstitutional and unequal' CHT agreement.
	   ``The CHT deal which will result in the surrender of one-tenth
of the country's territory to the terrorist group can not be
accepted. That's why, we are protesting against the accord,'' she
said and added that the BNP wanted a peaceful solution to the CHT
crisis, but the accord created tension in the CHT and other parts
of the country as well.
	   ``To us, the country and every inch of its land are above every
thing,'' Begum Zia said adding the long march had been organised to
safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty and integrity.
She urged the people of all walks of life to join the long march to
make it a success.
	   Painting a grim picture of the rule by the two-year old
government, the BNP Chairperson said the government proved itself
an utter failure in ruling the country. During the two-year rule,
the 4000 crore taka was borrowed by the government from commercial
banks, economy was ruined, business activities were at a
standstill, industries and educational institutions closed down one
after another and law and order situation was deteriorating day by
day.
	   She also blamed the government for indulging in deep-seated
corruption' and alleged that ``the post-liberation government of
the AL had a target for earning some money from blanket, but this
government is involved in limitless corruption in dealing with gas
and electricity.''
	   She underscored the need for ouster of the government through
movement to protect the country and the interests of the people.
There was no alternative to movement if we want to protect the
country and the people, she elaborated.
	   She also accused the government of violating its pledges given
when the Awami League was in the opposition. The AL had committed
to solving the problems of teachers and government employees, but
the promises were not kept, resulting in the hunger strike by the
primary teachers and the movement by the government employees, she
said.
	   Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan demanded resignation of the government for
its failure in different sectors, saying ``the sooner the
government is ousted from power the better for the nation.''
	   He also criticised the government for loadshedding that caused
numerous problems for the people and hampered production in the
industrial and business activities. He opined the government should
resign conceding its failure in tackling the electricity crisis.
	   Salam Talukder termed the government a failure, inefficient and
undemocratic' and called upon the BNP workers to be prepared for a
final movement to overthrow the government from power.

Bulgaria returns palaces and villas to exiled king
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's exiled king Simeon II will get
back the real estate of his ancestors which communists nationalized
51 years ago, a high court ruled Thursday.
	   Simeon, 61, now a businessman living in Madrid, Spain, was
restored ownership over two palaces, three hunting villas and two
country houses which the communist government confiscated in 1947,
a year after it abolished monarchy and exiled the royal family.
	   At a closed meeting, the 12-judge Constitutional Court, which is
empowered to review legislation, threw out a law about royal
property nationalization on a motion by Prosecutor General Ivan
Tatarchev.
	   The ruling coincides with a visit of Simeon's sister, Princess
Maria Louisa, to Bulgaria.
	   Restored property includes the palaces Vranya, in a Sofia suburb
of the same name, and Czarska Bistritsa on Rila mountain, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Sofia.
	   It also includes three hunting villas in Rila and two farm
houses near the city of Plovdiv, some 160 kilometers (100 miles)
east of Sofia.
	   All places have served as government mansions.
	   Simeon acceded to the throne at the age of 6 in 1943, when his
father Boris III died shortly after allying Bulgaria with Nazi
Germany.
	   He reigned under regencies until 1946, when communists, whom the
Soviet army installed in 1944, abolished monarchy in a referednum
widely suspected of being rigged.
	   Simeon enjoyed a tumultuous welcome by enthusiastic crowds
during two brief returns to his homeland in 1996 and 1997.

The trial of Bangabandhu murder case resumed at special ejlash

<TEXT>
of Dhaka District and Sessions Judge Court on Wednesday, after a
42-day recess due to sickness of the presiding Judge.
	   The trial was postponed on April 22 after Judge Kazi Golam Rasul
fell sick with hepatitis. Investigation officer of the case, who is
the last of 61 prosecution witnesses, was being cross examined by
the defence lawyers at that time.
	   The Judge took his seat on the podium at the special ejlash near
the Dhaka Central Jail, at 10:25 in the morning and enquired about
well-being of prosecution and defence lawyers as well as the five
accused facing trial on the dock.
	   He also informed them of his treatment. The District Judge,
whose billirubin stood at 22, underwent treatment at the Combined
Military Hospital.
	   The cross examination of IO Abdul Kahar Akand, an ASP of
Criminal Investigation Department, continued for a brief period on
Wednesday before the Judge adjourned the court till June 10
morning.
	   Akand informed the court that PW-3 M Selim alias Abdul told him
that Major Aziz Pasha, an absconding accused in the case, had shot
and killed Begum Mujib and others at the bedroom, on August 15,
1975.
	   ``Abdul didn't mention the name of any army personnel
directly... but he told me that three black uniformed people pulled
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,'' the IO said replying to
advocate Jasimuddin, state defence for Aziz Pasha.
	   The belated trial started early last year at the special ejlash
near the Dhaka Central Jail after Awami League returned to power
through June 12, 1996 general election and parliament scrapped
``black'' Indemnity Act that barred legal action against coup
plotters.
	   But 14 of the 19 accused are still absconding. They are believed
to be staying abroad.
	   Home Minister Major (retd) Rafiqul Islam on Tuesday said
Interpol has located ``some'' of those hiding abroad and assured
him of helping Bangladesh to bring them home for the trial.
	   Official sources said sacked army Major Bazlul Huda, who
allegedly shot Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman and is now held in a jail in Bangkok, was expected to be
brought back to Dhaka ``any time''.

Bangladesh will do all that is possible to help ease tensions in

<TEXT>
South Asia, Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, the Bangladesh Ambassador
to the United Nations in Geneva, has said, reports BSS.
	   He continued: ``Bangladesh will make best endeavours to
encourage such (positive) impulses, and help with follow-up action
in the spirit of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
to which all countries in the region belong,'' according to a
message received here yesterday.
	   The Ambassador was speaking at a special session of the
conference on disarmament convened on Tuesday, in Geneva, to
address the situation in South Asia following Indian and Pakistani
nuclear tests. He added that Bangladesh, which belonged to South
Asia, shared deep friendship with other regional countries and had
every confidence in their commitment to peace and their combined
capacity to work towards its achievement, and in the resolution of
problems.
	   The Ambassador added that for that forum which is the sole
multilateral body for negotiations on disarmament, it was important
that ``when different constituencies, cultures and value-systems
speak, we must not only hear it, but also listen.''
	   He warned, ``without this, mere urging and exhortations by some
on others to follow a line of action, and repeating those urging
and exhortations when these are ignored, will not bear fruit. This
will only embarrass those who make them, and those upon whom these
are made.''
	   More than 40 delegations participated in the one day debate,
added the message.

Russia to restore mine damaged by methane explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government will spend 42.2 million
rubles (dlrs 6.9 million) to repair a Russian-run coal mine in
northern Norway that was damaged by a methane explosion.
	   Twenty-three miners, all Russians and Ukrainians, were killed in
the September 1997 explosion on the remote Svalbard Islands. Some
of their bodies have still not been recovered.
	   Svalbard is Norwegian territory, but is open to non-military
activity by other countries. The Russian state mining company Trust
Arktikugol operated the mine in the village of Barentsburg.
	   The Interfax news agency said the Russian government will pay
back wages to miners who have been out of work since the explosion,
and will write off Arktikugol's 1995-97 taxes.

20-meter metal figures to converge on central Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris will celebrate the start of a month of World
Cup soccer with a spectacular, citywide extravaganza featuring four
giants slowly converging on the central Place de la Concorde.
	   The 20-meter-high (60-foot), metallic figures _ each weighing 27
metric tons (30 tons) and with a construction crane built into each
foot to propel and steady them _ symbolize the ``meeting of four
different ethnic groups, the origins of all humanity,'' Patricia
Gastineau, a spokeswoman for the organizers said Thursday.
	   The giants _ representing an American Indian, an African, an
Asian, and a European _ will march from the Arc d'Triomphe, the
Eiffel Tower, the Opera, and the Ile de la Cite to gather at a
vast, makeshift stage on the Place de la Concorde for a colorful
tribute to soccer.
	   The show will be held next Tuesday, 24 hours before the June 10
World Cup kickoff. It is designed to give hundreds of thousands of
Parisians an opportunity to feel part of the month-long tournament
even if they don't go to the games.
	   Two years of work have gone into preparing for the event. It
will feature 4,500 athletes and performers, including a total of
1,998 young soccer players, gymnasts, contortionists, dancers, and
Brazilian and African percussionists.
	   Three traffic circles had to be leveled to make way for the
mammoth figures. Seventy-two traffic lights were removed and the
heads of hundreds street lamps rotated 90 degrees, the organizers
said.

	   Members of the Asian community resident in London feel that

Middle East preoccupies ministers at Euro-Med conference
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with conference ends, fresh QUOTES  
  By JEFFREY ULBRICH  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) - The European Union and its Mediterranean
partners said Thursday they are increasingly concerned about the
stalled Middle East peace process, but insisted this should not
stop cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.
	   Foreign ministers from the 15 EU nations and 12 of their
Mediterranean partners worked during a two-day meeting under the
shadow of Middle East talks that seem to be going nowhere and an
explosive situation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo that could
be headed toward a Balkan war.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, summing up the two days of
talks, said the discussions reflected a deepening concern ``about
the obstacles which block the peace process, particularly the
non-implementation to date of the provisions in the
Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement.''
	   ``As you well know,'' he told a closing news conference, ``there
is an agreement by one party. We are still waiting for agreement
from the other party.''
	   The Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process, created at a
conference in Barcelona, Spain in 1995, is aimed at developing a
regional free-trade and security zone throughout the Mediterranean
basin by the year 2010. But conferences continue to get hung up on
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
	   ``The question is to what point the two can be linked,'' said
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. ``We can't really go all
the way with the present political situation. We can't mix the two
issues, but we have to talk about both of them.''
	   Israel, for its part, would prefer to keep the peace process and
the Euro-Med process completely separate, leaving the search for
peace in the hands of the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   ``The Barcelona process should not be allowed to be taken
hostage by the peace process, and this meeting clearly shows we
have come away from that,'' said Germany's foreign minister, Klaus
Kinkel, noting that ``everybody is frustrated and unhappy that
there is a stalemate'' between Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Many of the ministers also had Kosovo on their minds following a
renewed series of attacks in the province and a wave of refugees
moving across the border into Albania. The subject was not
discussed in the plenary sessions here, but was a hot topic on the
sidelines.
	   EU and Mediterranean experts now will be working to prepare a
Euro-Mediterranean stability and security pact with a view to
presenting it at the next conference, in April in Stuttgart,
Germany.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has not yet decided whether the

<TEXT>
long march to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) programme, chalked
out by it and its allies, including the Jamaat-e-Islami, should be
the beginning of a long-drawn anti-government agitation.
	   The party, which has geared up preparations for making the long
march programme a success, has yet to decide whether it will
announce a fresh action programme.
	   The BNP policy makers, when contacted by The Independent, failed
to say anything about whether the party would announce any
programme from Khagrachhari, where it would end its two-day long
march.
	   The hardliners and moderates in the party are reported to be
sharply divided on the issue of launching an all-out agitation
against the government after June 9.
	   The hardliners said that if the party wanted to avoid any
possible erosion of credibility, it would have to go for an all-out
movement. Otherwise, they opined, more BNP men would have to join
the Awami League as happened in the case of Dr Alauddin and Hasibul
Rahman Sawpan. They said that the BNP supporters had been subjected
to repression by the local administration in many places and there
was no alternative but to go for a movement to keep the party in
tact.
	   The hardliners also said that the confidence of the people in
the BNP had been shattered as the party had failed to launch any
movement against the misdeeds, corruption, power crisis, the law
and order situation and the atrocities of the ruling party. If the
long march if failed to generate considerable amount of confidence
in the leadership of the BNP, it would be difficult for the party
to go for any effective movement in future. They opined that the
BNP should announce the agitational programme after the long march.
	   On the other hand, the moderate group in the party said that the
party would have to initiate a sustainable movement. They said that
it was difficult for the party at this stage to go for an all-out
movement. A source said that the time was not ripe for an all-out
movement.
	   The moderate group further said that due to the programme
observed by the BNP, the party activists throughout the country
were facing tremendous pressure from the ruling party with more
than 30,000 cases having been filed against them throughout the
country.
	   They also said that the World Cup football would begin from June
10 which would continue for one month. During this time the
movement would not take off. Then the issue of SAARC summit and
World Cricket tournament would come up. The schedule for the visit
of American President Clinton in November was still on the agenda
and while Ramzan would begin from next December. As such, it would
be difficult for the BNP to go for an all-out movement before next
February.
	   The hardliners and the moderates are also divided on the issue
of joint movement with the Jamaat. It is learnt that while the BNP
decided to go to Khagrachhari, the Jamaat decided to go to
Rangamati to hold a rally after the long march. The BNP and Jamaat
also disagreed on the issue of addressing a public meeting from
same venue.

Man who claimed to be the world's oldest person dies

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Ali bin Mohammed Hussein, who claimed to
be 136 years old and thus the world's oldest person, has died,
newspapers said Thursday.
	   Hussein, also known as Zelem, died Wednesday in his hometown of
Qiniyeh in the northern Lebanese province of Akkar, the leading
An-Nahar newspaper and the English-language Daily Star reported.
	   ``He lived in silence and died in silence surrounded by a cloud
of cigarette smoke,'' said An-Nahar, pointing out that he was a
smoker all his life.
	   The paper published an image of Hussein's family status
document, showing he was born in 1862. But the registration of the
ID was made in 1932.
	   Hussein, a folk poet, used to entertain fellow villagers with
stories from the era of Ottoman rule that ended in 1918, the French
Mandate that followed and events of the declaration of independence
in 1943, the papers said.
	   But all the time Hussein lamented the fact that the Guinness
Book of Records refused to recognize him as the the world's oldest
person.
	   Guinness requires documents, including an authenticated birth
certificate, in order to bestow the title.
	   The current titleholder is Sarah Knauss, 117, who became the
world's recognized oldest person alive in April. Before Knauss, the
titleholder was France's Jeanne-Louis Calment who died last August
at 122.
	   Hussein is survived by 93 children, grandchildren and great
grandchildren.

Coke, Pepsi targeted as symbols of America by angry Indians
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-India-Nuclear  
  By HEMA SHUKLA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indians angry at America's attempt to
punish New Delhi for its nuclear tests are taking their
frustrations out on Coke and Pepsi.
	   The student union of Delhi University has asked cafeterias on
its 84 campuses not to stock Coca Cola or Pepsi and is trying to
enforce a complete boycott among students.
	   ``We want to tell (the United States) we conducted nuclear tests
because we feel threatened as a nation. But you don't treat us as a
nation, only as a market. If you impose sanctions on us, we will
boycott your products,'' said Anil Jha, president of Delhi
University Students Union.
	   ``It is a matter of honor for us,'' Jha said.
	   Following the five nuclear tests announced by India last month
and the sanctions imposed by the United States, local papers
carried reports of youths damaging a Pepsi and a Coke van in the
western city of Surat. And near India's financial hub of Bombay, a
commercial association has asked restaurants to stop selling Coke
and Pepsi.
	   The protest at Delhi University, in which some 450,000 students
are enrolled, would be the biggest, but it will be difficult to
judge its effectiveness before classes resume in July after the
two-month summer vacation.
	   R.S. Bhatia, who supplies Coke to the university, said the
university was a huge market and a ban would mean a large drop in
sales.
	   Pepsi officials in New Delhi refused comment. Coke officials
could not immediately be reached.
	   Kishan Singh, who runs a small store on the main Delhi
University campus, said he was afraid students would ransack his
shop if he defied the boycott.
	   Student activists said they would not use force to stop people
from drinking the popular drinks.

Police on Wednesday submitted a charge-sheet against the BNP

<TEXT>
chief Begum Khaleda Zia and former Home Minister Abdul Matin
Chowdhury in a corruption case.
	   The former Prime Minister and Abdul Matin Chowdhury were
indicted for cancelling the appointment of 287 police
sub-inspectors and appointing 745 new sub-inspectors by abusing
powers.
	   An officer of the Bureau of Anti-Corruption, Abdus Sattar
Sarker, had filed a corruption case with Ramna police station on
December 21, 1996, six months after the Awami League came to power.
	   In the First Information Report (FIR), it was said that the
caretaker government of Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed had recruited 287
sub-inspectors of police but the BNP government cancelled all 287
appointments.
	   Later, during the period from 1992 to 1994 the BNP government
appointed 745 sub-inspectors of police, who were identified as
their party cadres.
	   In a statement last night, BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan protested the filing of the charge sheet against the party
chief.
	   He claimed that the government had filed the charge-sheet
against Begum Khaleda Zia to lower her image when she had called
for a movement to save the country and her popularity had reached
the peak.
	   ``We ask the government to withdraw the false case
immediately.'' Otherwise, ``the fascist government will have to
bear all consequences,'' he said.

The Bangladesh Terry Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters

<TEXT>
Association (BTTLMEA) has urged the government not to reduce the
cash incentive to the garment exporters using the locally spun
yarn.
	   ``The withdrawal of financial support in the next budget to a
nascent industry like terry towel and linen manufacturing will be
suicidal,'' said the Chairman of the BTTLMEA, Shafiqul Islam, on
Wednesday adding, ``This would make more factories sick and their
owners bankrupt, thereby affecting the banking sector.''
	   At a press briefing held at the Jatiya Press Club on Wednesday,
the BTTLMEA Chairman said they were scared by press reports that
the government might reduce the cash incentive to only 10 per cent
from the existing 25 per cent. This, he said, was bound to create a
crisis in the export business.
	   The former President of the Association, Col (rtd) Anisuzzaman,
who was also present on the occasion, said the withdrawal of the
cash incentive would sabotage the export trade of Bangladesh.
	   The press briefing was also attended by the Vice President of
the Association, Mohammad Nasim, and Executive Committee members
Javed Ansari and Sheikh Hamid.
	   The BTTLMEA Chairman said the government had granted 15 per cent
cash incentive in 1991 to the exporters of apparels using the
locally spun yarn.
	   The incentive was increased to 25 per cent in 1995 to attract
investment in the textile sector in support of the government's
policy of expediting the backward linkage in the country's garments
sub-sector.
	   He said about 50 per cent of yarn was now being produced in the
country for the terry towel and linen factories and the production
of yarn would further increase in the next couple of years.
	   According to him, the situation demands all out support from the
government. It is not the time to reduce the support to the
government exports. He said, the investors had put their money in
the backward linkage industry, such as in spinning and waving,
taking into consideration the financial support as part of their
cost recovery in the short run.
	   Now, if the government reduces the incentives how would this
industry survive, the BTTLMEA President asked and urged the
government to understand their problems before reducing the
incentives.
	   The BTTLMEA Chairman said the terry towel and linen exports were
now rising in the US and European markets with Tk 362 crore worth
of shipments made in 1997. It would reach Tk 550 crore this year
indicating a steady rise in the coming years.
	   Col ( Rtd) Anisuzzaman accused the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB)
of allocating quotas to people not directly engaged in terry towel
and linen manufacturing alleging that genuine exporters were
deprived.
	   This has created a black market in the quota administration, he
alleged demanding a fair distribution of quotas to the benefit of
the real exporters.
	   The BTTLMEA Chairman demanded that the banks enhance the margin
of financing the L/Cs from 75 per cent at present to 90 per cent to
allow the exporters' access to more working capital.
	   The banks should also adhere to a time frame to issue inland
L/Cs against export L/Cs to help maintain time schedule for export.
The procedures for reimbursement of the cash incentive also needed
to be simplified, he said adding ``the deduction of income tax of
0.25 per cent should be based on the amount of value addition only
instead of total negotiated value of the L/Cs.''

The President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of

<TEXT>
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), Yousuf Abdullah Harun, has stressed
the need for accelerating the pace of reforms and infrastructure
development before going for further liberalisation of the
country's trade regime.
	   ``We want some protection to domestic industries and so trade
liberalisation should now go slow giving way to reforms and
infrastructure building.''
	   In a pre-budget exchange of views with The Independent, the
President of the country's apex business body said that the fiscal
measures in the new budget which, would come into effect from July
1, should focus on creating a favourable business environment for
the home industries.
	   Harun, the boss of the country's leading business conglomerate,
said that Bangladesh had gone too far in regard to trade
liberalisation while neglecting reforms and infrastructure
development that were needed to develop competitive business
conditions in the country against cheaper imports.
	   He said that it had wrought havoc with the country's industrial
sector. Many industries had died, others had become sick and their
owners had become bankrupt. Therefore, it is time, the government
turned to areas where more attention was needed to beef up
competitiveness.
	   What is needed is quick implementation of reforms and building
and expansion of more infrastructure projects like ports, roads,
bridges and telecommunication, he said.
	   In the new budget, he argued the government should not,
therefore, reduce duty on the import of finished goods while
reducing duty on the import of industrial raw materials and
intermediate goods.
	   Explaining to the logic behind this argument, he said a
relatively high duty on import of finished goods would protect
domestic manufacturing units while a cutback on the duty on raw
materials and industrial machinery would encourage investors to set
up new industries in the country. ``We want to see a change in the
course of direction in the industrial sector,'' Harun said.
	   He stressed the need for the expansion of the country's taxnet
which might include expansion of the Value Added Tax (VAT) at the
retailers level. But in doing so the government should take care of
two things, he said.
	   In the first place, the tax administration should be
restructured to avoid complex procedure and harassment to the tax
payers. Secondly, in no way the government should tax the people's
productivity. It should stagger the incidence of tax on new
production lines and business.
	   He said without improving the tax administration, there was
little scope to ensure tax payers' cooperation with the government.
He called upon the government to make the tax administration system
simple and corruption free.
	   The FBCCI President felt that the country's taxnet could take
into its fold the ``commercial income'' of doctors, engineers and
architects. He said that the government had taxed the earnings of
chartered accountants last year. There was no valid reason why
others engaged in similar income earning practice should be spared.
	   Harun underlined the need for saving public expenditure from
unnecessary waste. ``It is not the size of the annual development
programme that matters. It is the quality of the expenditure and
priority of projects in the national perspective that should be
ensured in the budget,'' he said.
	   About the revenue expenditure, the FBCCI President stressed the
need to contain the expenditure at a reasonable level so that more
funds could be made available for development projects, he said.
	   The FBCCI President said that the Finance Ministry and the
business community this year worked very closely in budgetary
matters to make it more responsive to the needs of the private
sector.
	   As a result, there was little scope for misunderstanding over
the next budget which is expected to be placed before Parliament in
a few days after its opening on June 10.

Kashmir called source of newly nuclear India-Pakistan rivalry
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Indian prime minister's comments. Trims. No
pickup  
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By DONNA BRYSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An international meeting Thursday on
India's nuclear rivalry with neighboring Pakistan likely means that
the world's five original nuclear powers will address the main
dispute between the two countries: Kashmir.
	   The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways
to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race. India and
Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both
are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
	   No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three
times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing
Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of
Economics' Asia Research Center.
	   One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by
officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both
countries claim.
	   ``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I
think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain
said.
	   Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be
addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists
it remain a bilateral issue. Now, Hussain said, India fears the
Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
	   India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while
Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting
Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
rejected the possibility of international mediation. Vajpayee
repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
	   On Thursday, Vajpayee told Parliament that India would welcome
any international initiative on global disarmament, but said
focusing on South Asia alone was unfair.
	   Vajpayee also said India and Pakistan were under ``unwarranted''
pressure to sign a global test ban treaty. India has long spurned
both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because
they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States to give up their nuclear arsenals.
	   The five foreign secretaries, meeting in Geneva as the permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, were expected to call on
India to sign the NPT and the CTBT.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory shut
down shops and cleared streets of traffic with a general strike in
the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state Thursday, saying they
believe the world was now paying attention to their protests.
	   ``Unless the issue (of Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of
the people under international principles, peace will not return to
the Indian subcontinent,'' said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All
Parties Hurriet Conference called the strike in Srinagar city. The
conference is a coalition of parties who want Indian-held Kashmir
to break away either to form an independent country or join
Pakistan.
	   India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training
anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only
moral support.

Striking Ukrainian miners give lukewarm support to new minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Striking miners offered lukewarm support
for Ukraine's new coal minister Thursday, but gave no indication
they plan to stop strikes and other protests over wages and working
conditions.
	   Serhiy Tulub, a former senior mine official and government
administrator in eastern Ukraine's coal-producing Donetsk region,
took office Wednesday.
	   President Leonid Kuchma, who appointed him, said Tulub ``knows
that reforms in the industry must be started from inside.''
	   ``There is more mess there than anywhere else,'' Kuchma said,
according to the newspaper Segodnya.
	   The leader of the Independent Miners Union said Tulub's
appointment was ``not the worst scenario, but not the best
either.''
	   However, Mykhailo Volynets praised the new minister as being
``one of the most enterprising managers'' in Ukraine's coal
industry.
	   Kuchma fired Tulub's predecessor, Stanislav Yanko, last month
after he reached retirement age, but the move was widely seen as a
response to the miners strikes that began across Ukraine in May.
	   The miners are demanding the payment of overdue wages _
estimated at up to 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) _ salary
increases and more government funds for their struggling industry,
plagued by deadly accidents caused by safety problems and outdated
equipment.
	   The miners' union said 45 mines were on strike Thursday, but the
Coal Industry Ministry put the number at 30.

Recent changes in quality control measures on fishery products

<TEXT>
introduced by the main importing countries represent a new
challenge for the developing world and require major investment,
according to a study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) released recently.
	   The FAO study was prepared for the four-day long meeting of the
Sub-Committee on Fish Trade in Bremen, Germany, began Wednesday,
when major issues of international trade in fishery products are
expected to be discussed by delegates from around 60 countries and
representatives from Inter-governmental Organisations (WTO, OECD
among others) and NGOs, including WWF and Greenpeace.
	   The agenda of the meeting of this sub-committee of FAO's
Committee on Fisheries (COFI) include: recent quality control
measures in the main importing countries; resource
over-exploitation; and environmental concerns.
	   The study recalled that in August 1997, the European Community
stopped imports of seafood from India, Bangladesh and Madagascar.
In December 1997, there was a decision to prohibit the import of
fresh seafood from Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Uganda.
	   ``The impact of these measures was severe in the seafood
industry of the exporting countries, creating loss of employment
and foreign exchange earnings of several hundreds of million of US
dollars,'' FAO report underlined.
	   ``The investments needed to bring a fish processing plant up to
the new standards are substantial, and many companies feel that the
implementation of the new regulations on fishery products is de
facto a non-tariff measure against value added products originating
from developing countries,'' according to FAO.
	   Another obstacle to trade could be created by ecolabelling, that
is certification that the fish was produced from a sustainable
managed resource. ``There is a danger that small-scale fishermen in
the developing countries may be disadvantaged by difficulties to
certify their fish production,'' FAO fisheries expert Erhard Ruckes
said.
	   ``Fish is the most important food product exported by developing
countries. It comes well before coffee, banana and tea,'' according
to Ruckes.
	   ``For many developing countries, fish trade is a significant
source of foreign currency earnings. Net-exports by these countries
rose from US$5.2 billion in 1985 to US$17.2 billion in 1996,''
Ruckes added.
	   Developed countries account for more than 80 per cent of total
imports of fishery products. Japan is the biggest importer,
followed by the United States and the European Community.
	   ``In 1996, world fish production including aquaculture, totalled
121 million tons representing a value over US$120 billion. Taking
into account trade or value-addition on the way to the consumer,
global fish business is estimated at more than US$250 billion,''
Ruckes underlined.
	   The Bremen meeting will also discuss trends in the exploitation
of fishery resources and their implications for trade as well as
recent international initiatives regarding fisheries management.
	   It has been estimated that in 1994 about 35 per cent of the 200
major marine fishery resources showed declining yields, 25 per cent
had a stable exploitation at a high level and 40 per cent yields
were still increasing. ``The potential for further expansion of
theses resources is strictly limited, despite the expansion of some
fisheries into deeper waters,'' according to FAO.
	   ``Several countries have expressed the wish to see FAO play a
stronger role in the elaboration of the criteria for listing
species in the frame of the Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),'' FAO expert
said.
	   CITES underlines that when a species is endangered to a point
close to extinction, international trade may be prohibited or
submitted to stringent control measures.
	   Last June, all sturgeon species were listed in an appendix of
the Convention. The major consequence was the regulation of
international trade in Caviar.
	   FAO has developed a project for the establishment of FIGIS
(Fisheries Global Information System) which will initially
concentrate on information and analysis of the biological status of
aquatic resources. In a later stage, it will include pertinent
trade information such as products, prices, market trends,
countries of origin and destination.
	   At Bremen, FAO will also review its co-operation with the Common
Fund for Commodities aimed at helping small-scale fish producers in
developing countries.

LONDON (JP): There's been much heavy breathing from NATO this

<TEXT>
week, as the Western alliance tries to frighten Yugoslav strongman
Slobodan Milosevic into restoring peace in Serbia's
Albanian-majority province of Kosovo. This time, say NATO sources
in Brussels, there will be ``no failure to engage early and
assertively'' (as there certainly was in Bosnia). But it's probably
the same empty bluff as usual, and Milosevic doesn't look the least
bit impressed.
	   The fourth Balkan war of the 1990s is now getting underway in
Kosovo for the same reason as all the others: it serves Milosevic's
domestic political purposes. He needs to distract the Serbs from
their economic misery, and in particular he needs a crisis that
will help him to impose his candidate as president in the election
in Montenegro on May 31.
	   All that's left of Yugoslavia (thanks to Milosevic's previous
wars in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia) is the two republics of
Serbia and Montenegro. The latter has only 600,000 people to
Serbia's 10 million, but it controls a big block of seats in the
federal parliament, so Milosevic's own power was threatened when
Momir Bulatovic, his man in Montenegro, was ousted last October.
	   The new Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, hints at
secession if Belgrade does not drop the extreme Serb nationalist
policies that have brought sanctions and economic ruin to both
parts of the federation. But Milosevic could not survive such a
change of policy, and Montenegrins are basically 'mountain Serbs'.
	   So as part of Milosevic's effort to sway this month's
Montenegrin election in favor of his loyal pawn, Momir Bulatovic,
he has stirred up a new crisis in Kosovo. The idea is to return the
Montenegrins to their old pro-Serb loyalties by emphasizing the
threat to the 'sacred Serbian territory' of Kosovo.
	   But surely there's more to it than that. What about all the
ancient ethnic hatreds that bedevil former Yugoslavia?
	   The 'ancient ethnic hatreds' are a myth. There was hostility
between Serbs and Croats as a result of World War II, but nothing
comparable between Moslems and Christians in Bosnia, nor between
Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. The lie about ancient, irrepressible
ethnic hatreds was fabricated in the early 1990s by European
diplomats to justify their own inaction in the face of the Bosnian
genocide, and swallowed wholesale by the ignorant Western media.
	   The 'Kosovo problem' is actually only nine years old. Serbs and
Albanians lived together in peace in this southernmost bit of
Serbia for a thousand years, until Milosevic discovered in 1989
that the road to power lay in appealing to the paranoid and
self-pitying side of Serbian nationalism.
	   For some centuries Albanian-speaking Moslems have been the
majority in Kosovo, now making up over 90 percent of the province's
2 million people. But few people disputed Kosovo's historic ties to
Serbia, because the former communist government of Yugoslavia gave
the Kosovars full autonomy within Serbia, including
Albanian-language education, media, and medical services.
	   Relations only went bad after Milosevic won power in Belgrade in
1989 by playing up Serbs' fears about their minority status in
Kosovo. The Serbs there were oppressed, he claimed, and promptly
destroyed Kosovo's autonomy. Since 1989, all official institutions
in Kosovo have been monopolized by the tiny Serb minority.
	   The Albanian majority responded with great restraint, creating
their own parallel system of unofficial schools, hospitals and
services while peacefully seeking the return of self-rule. But
their requests, being non-violent, were ignored by everybody.
	   A handful of frustrated Kosovars turned to terrorism two years
ago, but they were repudiated by the vast majority, and the level
of violence in Kosovo was still lower than that in Spain's Basque
provinces -- until March, when Milosevic sent in the Serbian
special forces to massacre an entire village. Now an estimated
120,000 Albanian peasants have abandoned non-violence to enlist in
the Kosovo Liberation Army, and 200 people are already dead.
	   This is presumably the result Milosevic wanted: after the last
nine years, he cannot plead ignorance. But why did he want it?
	   Recently I found some old notes from a conference in Belgrade in
1977, and realized that I interviewed Slobodan Milosevic two
decades ago. The point is that I forgot about it: he was a typical
mid-level apparatchik without an idea in his head, and I didn't
even use the interview. Whereas if I had met Adolf Hitler or Pol
Pot early in their careers, I'm sure I would not have forgotten it.
	   All three men came to power by exploiting a paranoid streak of
nationalism that saw the Germans/Cambodians/Serbs as the innocent
victims of a global conspiracy. Milosevic's wars have cost perhaps
a quarter-million lives, a far smaller toll than Hitler's or Pol
Pot's, but that is not the real distinction between them. It is
that Milosevic is an utterly amoral careerist.
	   Hitler and Pol Pot had an intensity of conviction that made them
into forces of nature: they distilled and personified the fears and
hatreds that drove their genocides. Whereas Milosevic is totally
cynical about the nationalist obsessions he exploits in his
fellow-Serbs. When I first met him, he was cheerfully throwing
Serbian nationalists into jail for anti-communist activities.
	   Milosevic has never sought anybody's death as a matter of
principle; genocide is only desirable if it serves the higher goal
of his own political survival. None of the wars that have wrecked
former Yugoslavia since he came to power were inevitable. They just
seemed like good tactics at the time to a sociopath in power -- a
man with no fixed ideas or values beyond his own advancement, and
nothing much by way of a long-term strategy either.
	   The disproportion between atrocious means and petty ends in
Kosovo is typical of Milosevic. Nor is he deterred by the prospect
that this time the conflict may end in the partition of Serbia
itself, so long as the Serbs blame somebody else: the main thing is
that his own power survives. These tactics have worked before, and
he has no reason to believe that they will not work again.

THE National Environment Board Wednesday resolved to ban farming

<TEXT>
of black-tiger prawns in fresh water areas, Deputy Science Minister
Pornthep Tejapaibul said.
	   About 870 farmers who have invested in the in-land black-tiger
prawn farms would be given a grace period of four months before
being asked to halt the business, Pornthep said.
	   He said the NEB would soon submit a request to Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai to invoke the 1992 Environment Act and issue an order
to ban in-land black-tiger prawn farming.
	   A Fishery Department survey has found that 872 farmers had dug
ponds in land over 10,000 rai to farm black-tiger prawns. They had
filled the ponds with sea water.
	   Rice farmers and environmentalists have voiced concern that salt
and salt water released or seeping from the ponds had damaged fresh
water sources, which are needed for paddy fields. The water was
also damaging fertile farming land.
	   Deputy Agriculture Minister Wirat Rattanaset said he disagreed
with NEB's resolution because the prawn farmers had already
invested a lot of money.
	   Wirat said the black-tiger prawn farmers could be asked to
install water treatment systems at their farms instead of banning
their farming.
	   ''We have proposed some measures to NEB so that the farmers
could be treated with leniency but the NEB has refused to consider
the measures,'' Wirat complained.
	   Wirat said the water treatment system could prevent polluted
water from the farms damaging the environment by up to 90 per cent.
He admitted that only 5 per cent of farmers have installed the
system.
	   But Pornthep argued that the water treatment system could not
prevent soil salinity.
	   ''Salt cannot be dissolved and will stay there forever so the
inland farming of black-tiger prawns will have to be stopped,''
Pornthep said.
	   He said the Science Ministry would draft measures to
rehabilitate the damaged soil following the ban.
	   Wirat said the Agriculture Ministry would assist the farmers
after the ban by providing them with fish and fresh-water prawns
for breeding instead of black-tiger prawns.
	   He said the ban would deprive the country of Bt10 billion in
exports.

<TEXT>
investment incentive agreement to facilitate US private investment
in Bangladesh, says a press release.
	   Bangladesh Ambassador to the United States, KM Shahabuddin
signed the agreement on behalf of the country and President of the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) George Munoz signed
it for OPIC.
	   Under the agreement, OPIC will provide political risk insurance
and debt financing to American companies making long-term
investment in Bangladesh.
	   The agreement paves the way for OPIC's financial support to US
investors working in Bangladesh, including $375 million in
financial support for Unocal's proposed Western Region Integrated
Project (WRIP). OPIC previously announced that it would provide US$
175 million in loan guarantees and US$200 million in political risk
insurance for the project, underscoring its support for such
infrastructure development in Bangladesh.
	   The project involves the development of the Shahbazpur natural
gas field in Bhola, installation of a 150 km pipeline from the gas
field to the city of Khulna, and at a later stage to other parts of
south-western Bangladesh; and power generation facilities to
provide electricity in the region.
	   Since 1971, OPIC provided supports of US$ 107.8 billion
investments in developing countries. Unocal has already invested
over $5 billion in energy projects in Asia and successfully
implemented projects that include resource development,
transportation facilities and power production.

LAOS agreed Wednesday to allow Thai-registered vehicles to enter

<TEXT>
Vientiane instead of parking at the foot of the Thai-Lao Friendship
Bridge, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Wednesday.
	   Kobsak said that the vehicles needed insurance that covered
accidents in foreign countries. He did not, however, say when the
new measure would become effective.
	   The agreement was made Wednesday at a meeting between Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan and his Lao counterpart Somsavat Lengsavad
during the former's three-day official visit to Vientiane.
	   The bridge over the Mekong is the first between Thailand and
Laos and was opened in 1994, linking the Lao capital with Nongkhai
province in Thailand.
	   Laos has refused to allow Thai vehicles into the capital for
fear of traffic congestion.
	   Meanwhile Surin said in a telephone interview from Vientiane
that Thailand had informed Laos that the Interior Ministry had
agreed to a proposal to allow vehicles from Laos to enter Udon
Thani province.
	   He added that the Transportation Ministry of Thailand would
endorse the proposal with immediate effect. At present vehicles
from Laos can go only to Nong Khai province.
	   Surin said that he had assured Laos that Thailand would take
serious and immediate action against a group of ethnic Hmong living
in Thailand whose presence has soured Thai-Lao relations as Laos
has accused the group, living in Thamkrabok monastery in Saraburi
province, of being rightists conducting activities against the Lao
government.
	   Kobsak added that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had asked Surin
to convey the message to Laotian authorities that Thailand was
serious in solving the Hmong problem in order to eliminate
suspicion between both countries.
	   ''The Laotian side has also been informed that Thailand will ask
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to screen the
Hmongs in Thamkrabok monastery,'' Surin said.
	   Surin added that he had proposed a new framework for Thai-Lao
relations called Interdependence Partnership towards 2003 and aimed
at greater bilateral prosperity.
	   Thailand and Laos plan to sign four bilateral agreements
covering extradition, finance and cross-border transport when
Laotian Prime Minister Sisawath Kaewbounphan visits Bangkok later
this year, Surin said.
	   He also submitted a letter of complaints from Thai businessmen
who face difficulties in doing business in Laos.
	   Vientiane also informed Thailand that it would allow Thai
diplomats to visit Thais jailed in Laos.

Still counting the dead, a bewildered town begins to mourn
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-Germany-Train Derails  
  By ANNE THOMPSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Bewildered by a disaster on their
doorsteps and still counting the dead, the people of Eschede began
Thursday to cope with the rites of mourning a hundred or more
strangers killed in a high-speed train crash.
	   ``This is just a little Lower Saxony village. It's very
depressing to people here,'' said Rev. Christoph Kuenkel, the local
Lutheran pastor. ``They don't understand how something like this
could have happened in this place.''
	   Answers to why a high-speed train smashed into an overpass must
wait for another day. On Thursday, Kuenkel was preparing for a
memorial service in the evening.
	   Loudspeakers and bleacher seats were installed outside for those
who won't be able to crowd into the Johanniskirche (St. John
Church), a simple, yellow wooden building designed for 400 people.
	   The crash brought an immediate response from residents _ a cup
of coffee, a blanket for a bleeding survivor, a bed for a relative
who rushed in fearing a loved one was among the victims.
	   ``I still can't believe that this has cost so many lives. This
is just a little village in the heath that no one has ever heard
of,'' said Birgit Puhl, 42, a Red Cross volunteer who had driven 30
kilometers (20 miles) from her home in Wathlingen to extend help to
relatives of the dead and injured.
	   Exemplifying the local response, one local woman stopped her
bicycle Thursday morning to ask reporters if they needed anything.
	   The army took the media in hand Thursday, escorting reporters
and camera crews around the town and to the crash scene on four
open trucks. Streets were crowded with the cars and trucks of
rescue workers; the satellite uplink vans of the TV crews and the
reporters gravitated to what had been an empty lot next to the
rescue control center.
	   The rescue workers were too busy to mourn.
	   ``No I haven't gotten to the point of even thinking about that
yet,'' said fire chief Rolf Pundschus, ``but I'm sure it will come
when I have a quiet moment to think about it.''
	   Bernd Schlawer, 45, said he had provided beds for a man from
Hanover who had come searching for his wife, and had come with
their son.
	   Two days earlier, Schlawer and five of his children had pedaled
their bikes of the bridge struck by the train. ``Two days ago it
was so beautiful, the trees, the birds and the sky, how could we
know that this horrible thing would happen in this beautiful
place?'' he said.
	   Before going his way, Schlawer handed over a copy of the
Christian leaflet warning of sudden death that he distributes
regularly at train stations and other places in the area.
	   ``One second decided the fate of the Titanic,'' the leaflet
said. ``There is a tragic parallel in many people's lives. Again
and again, what counts is the decisive second _ suddenly the
trailer of the truck swerves, suddenly the steel girders buckle,
suddenly the heart attack...''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Etoh slugged a three-run home run in the
fifth inning and Kenjiro Nomura belted a home run in the seventh as
the Central League's first-place Hiroshima Toyo Carp edged the
Hanshin Tigers 4-3 at Koshien Stadium on Thursday.
	   Etoh has eight homers and Nomura four homers this season.
	   The victory widened the Carp's lead over the second-place
Chunichi Dragons to two games. The Dragons were idle Thursday.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Takeo Kawamura hurled a three-hitter over 7 2/3
innings and reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched hitless in the
remaining innings as the Yokohama BayStars blanked the Yomiuri
Giants 3-0.
	   The BayStars' Takanori Suzuki hit a solo home run, his sixth
homer of the season, in the sixth inning. His teammate Tatsuya
Shindo belted another solo home run, his eighth homer of the
season, in the seventh.
	   Kawamura is 4-2. Sasaki scored his 14th save this season and
179th save in his career.
	   In the Pacific League, the Nippon Ham Fighters scored four runs
after two outs and no runners on bases in the top of the ninth and
beat the Seibu Lions 9-7 at Seibu Dome.
	   After two outs in the ninth, Jerry Brooks singled home a run
with two walked runners on bases and Nigel Wilson hit a tying
one-run single.
	   Then, Katsuhiro Nishiura singled home two runs.
	   In the top of the first inning, Wilson, formerly with the
Cleveland Indians, hit a three-run homer, his 10th homer of the
season.
	   The Lions' Domingo Martinez, formerly with Triple-A Rochester,
hit a three-run home run, his 10th homer of the season, in the
bottom of the first inning.
	   Brooks formerly played with the Florida Marlins.
	   No other games were scheduled Thursday.

Tracts, and historical archaeology of heterogeneous religious
communities made the country one of the best attractive places of

Chittagong and Cox's Bazar into exclusive tourist zone to attract
the foreigners.
	   Explaining the government announced various facilities,

To bail out space station, Russia to charge for radio
</HEADLINE>
transmissions  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is reaching to the skies to raise money for
its share of the international space station.
	   Faced with a funding crisis that has delayed the launch of the
multinational project, the Russian government has imposed a new tax
on the use of radio frequency bands, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Thursday.
	   The tax will specifically target cellular phones, mobile radio
communications and personal global satellite communications, among
others, ITAR-Tass said. The revenue will go toward the
international space station.
	   The station, for which Russia is contributing crucial parts,
including a power and propulsion module and a housing module, is to
be launched in stages beginning in November.
	   That is a year behind the original launch date because Russian
cash shortages set back construction of the Russian elements of the
station.
	   The government has not yet announced how much it will charge for
radio frequency transmissions, nor how much it expects to earn from
the new tax.
	   Last week, the country's top space official said Russia might
have to scrap the Mir space station this fall, a year ahead of
schedule, to free up money for the international space station.

SINCE the government and the opposition decided to take their

<TEXT>
political rivalry into the field, they have for the first time
disclosed the list of their players for the charity soccer match on
June 27 at Bangkok's newly finished Rajamangkala Stadium.
	   MP Thawatchai Sajjakul (Dem-Bangkok), an organiser and the
spokesman for the government team, told an iTV show that proceeds
from the match would be used to fund the government anti-drug
campaigns. He added that the match was also to test the new
stadium, built for the Bangkok Asian Games in December.
	   Government players would include Surin Pitsuwan, Suthas
Ngernmuen, Jurin Laksanavisit, Abhisit Vejjajiva, Arkom Engchuan,
Suthep Thaugsuban, Pradit Pataraprasith, Akrapol Sorasuchart (all
Democrats), Pongpol Adireksarn and Sonthaya Khunpluem of the Chat
Thai Party, Chaiyos Sasomsup and Newin Chidchob of the Solidarity
Party, and Social Action Party's Suwit Khunkitti and Somsak
Kiatsuranon. Charoen Khanthawong will serve as the government
team's manager.
	   MP Veerakorn Kamprakob (NAP-Nakhon Sawan) said the opposition
team would be joined by outspoken MP Chalerm Yoobamrung, who
expressed his eagerness to see Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai in the
field.
	   Veerakorn said others in the opposition team were Premsak
Piayura, Chaturon Chaisaeng, Adisorn Piengket, Ronritthichai
Khankhet, Poonsawat Moonlasartsathorn, Ekkaporn Rakkwamsuk,
Chatchai Iasakul, Korn Dabaransi, Suwat Liptapallop, Prachuap
Chaisarn and Sopon Phetsawang. The charismatic Samak Sundaravej
prefers to be a commentator.
	   ----------------------------- TANYA Sirivedhin, the first woman
to become a Bank of Thailand deputy governor, never imagined she
would have to work so hard when she was approaching retirement.
	   ''I used to want to retire at 55. I dreamed of working on
translations of books or teaching English to poor children,'' she
said.
	   Tanya comes from a distinguished background. Her father Boonma
Wongsawan was a respected finance minister, and her husband
Anumongkhol is rector of the National Institute of Development
Administration.
	   Tanya is now busy helping the new governor M R Chatu Mongol
Sonakul with the restructuring of the central bank. The lady
economist has put off her dream of having an easier time for a
while.
	   ----------------------------- A SI Sa Ket man who broke a world
record for living with hundreds of poisonous snakes for a week
might have to call Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai his ''master'',
says Labour and Social Welfare Minister Trairong Suwankhiri
half-jokingly.
	   ''The man only stayed with the snakes for seven days, but our
premier has already spent six months with the 'cobras' from the
Prachakorn Thai Party,'' Trairong quipped.
	   But with the dissident faction now facing expulsion from the
party after being booted from its executive board, the ''cobras''
and the government seem to be in their most difficult situation
ever.

Julie Andrews calls reports she'll never sing again exaggerated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Julie Andrews says the reports of the death of her
singing voice are greatly exaggerated.
	   After the star of ``The Sound of Music'' and ''Mary Poppins''
had surgery last year to treat painful nodules in her throat,
reports circulated that she would never sing again.
	   But Thursday, she insisted any damage to her singing voice was
not irreparable and said she was merely taking a year off.
	   ``It's like an athlete that takes a season out, and that's what
I'll be doing,'' she said. ``Much has been made of it that wasn't
exactly true. ... It's not as disastrous as people were led to
believe.''
	   The 62-year-old actress was unveiled Thursday as the latest star
to join the lineup of a 4 million pound (dlrs 6.5 million) musical
stage version of ``Dr. Dolittle,'' which will premiere in London on
July 14.
	   Andrews will not appear in the show, but is lending her speaking
voice to the multilingual parrot Polynesia, which will teach the
show's star to talk to the animals.
	   The advantage of playing Polynesia, even via a recording, is
obvious, she said: ``I will be able to add `bird' to my resume.''

The price of all categories of tea in its weekly sale here

<TEXT>
Wednesday registered a sharp fall due to selective buying by
exporters amid general decline in quality.
	   However, the internal market lent fair support, market sources
said.
	   CTC Brokens: Bold brokens were on a strong demand and were
dearer by Tk 2 to Tk 3 with larger brokens also dearer by Tk 1 to
Tk 3.
	   Medium and smaller types met a fair demand, mostly at lower
rates-generally declining by Tk 4 to Tk 7, excepting few good
liquoring types which dropped by Tk 3 to Tk 4.
	   CTC Fannings: Fannings had a fair demand; but with the progress
of the sale, the demand slackened with fairly heavy withdrawals and
the rates, in general, were easier by Tk 4 to Tk 6. Plainer types
declined further.
	   Green Tea: 80 chests on offer were also on a strong demand. Both
Fine Young Hyson and Young Hyson were sold at Tk 110.
	   CTC Dust: 1924 chests, 2238 gunny sacks experienced a less
demand at easier rates.
	   Best Liquoring PD/RD were sold at firm to dearer rates following
a competition while the rest experienced an easing by Tk 3 to Tk 5.
D/CD were lower by Tk 10 to Tk 15. Major blenders and Bazzar lent a
fairly good support.
	   There were a total of 17,544 Chests, 6,540 Gunny Sacks up for
grab at the auction.
	   The next weekly sale will be held on June 9.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ President Arpad Goencz announced June
18 as the date for the first session of the new parliament
following recent elections in which Premier Gyula Horn's Socialists
were voted out of office.
	   Goencz already has made clear that he will ask 35-year-old
Viktor Orban, whose Young Democrats-Civic Party emerged winner from
the ballot, to form the next government.
	   Orban's party has already concluded coalition talks with the
Democratic Forum and similar talks with the Smallholders are
scheduled for late Thursday.
	   After Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned Orban
Wednesday, he told the state-run agency MTI that she ``expressed
her pleasure that a party committed to Euro-Atlantic integration
won the parliamentary elections.''
	   The official Hungarian Gazette published Thursday the final
official election results.
	   The Young Democrats-Civic Party won 147 seats, followed by the
Hungarian Socialist Party with 134.
	   The Independent Smallholders' Party gained 48 seats, the
Alliance of Free Democrats 24, the Hungarian Democratic Forum 18,
the extreme rightist Hungarian Truth and Life Party 14. A lone
independent will make up the 386-seat chamber.
	   Orban has made it clear even prior to coalition talks that his
party will hold the portfolios of finance, foreign affairs and a
new big ministry in charge of the economy.
	   Tapped to head finance is Laszlo Urban, 39, a U.S.-trained
banker, while the economy minister, who will oversee economic
strategy, labor, trade, industry, tourism and infrastructural
development, will be Attila Chikan, 54. He has studied at Stanford
University. Urban and Chikan agree on the need to pursue a strict
fiscal policy.
	   Janos Martonyi, 54, a senior at the Hungarian branch of Baker
and McKensie, the international law firm, will get the foreign
portfolio.

ALTHOUGH the government might get a pass grade for steering the

<TEXT>
economy on the right course to recovery, it has failed to convince
the public of its accomplishments to date, former prime minister
Anand Panyarachun warned after a meeting with the prime minister on
Tuesday night.
	   Bracing for another round of Asian turmoil, Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai had meetings Wednesday and on Tuesday with Anand, also
chairman of the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). Key
economic ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi and Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, and
senior TDRI economists were present at the talks.
	   The key agenda for Tuesday's meeting focused on the fine tuning
of economic policies to emphasise resolving the liquidity crunch
and revitalising the export and manufacturing sectors. In
Wednesday's talks, Anand presented the prime minister with the
findings of TDRI's studies on social rehabilitation.
	   ''This government should keep the public informed of its overall
economic direction: it is a matter of what the government is
working on, not what Tarrin or Supachai have been doing,'' Anand
said.
	   He suggested that the administration had an obligation to foster
public understanding of its measures to tackle economic woes, not
abandoning the people to figure it out for themselves by piecing
together the announcements from separate government agencies.
	   He also emphasised that the government had made significant
progress in terms of winning back business confidence, imposing
fiscal discipline, ensuring currency stability and strengthening
financial institutions, although it should now start to address the
problems inhibiting exports and industrial production.
	   Tarrin, seen as an advocate of fiscal discipline, voiced
optimism that various stimulus measures would soon bear fruit,
easing the liquidity crunch.
	   He cited the recent decision to increase this year's deficit
spending by Bt50 billion and the instructions to the Export-Import
Bank of Thailand to speed up loans to exporters as two key measures
to inject fresh cash into the economy.
	   Supachai said he agreed with Anand's proposal that the policy
focus on economic and currency stability must go hand in hand with
the need to nurture the production sector.
	   He urged greater attention to tackling problems related to
domestic production and the country's competitiveness in
international trade.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-artham conceded that the
weakening yen might further complicate the government's efforts to
revitalise the ailing economy.
	   Pisit disclosed that the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank had given assurances of additional aid should the
country face a new round of crisis.
	   Encouraged by the improvement in current accounts and other key
economic indicators, the Finance Ministry will continue to balance
its policies between maintaining fiscal discipline and affecting
quick pump-priming measures to stimulate the economy, he said.
	   PM's Office Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva commented that the
government was facing a challenge to balance its policy objectives
between growth and stability.
	   While fiscal discipline is vital to restoring business
confidence and preparing for recovery, the economy has declined so
much more than anticipated as to prompt the necessity of stimulus
measures, he explained.
	   He noted that the short-term measures to correct certain
shortcomings, such as sudden jitters in the exchange rate, should
be carefully applied so as not to supersede the long-term goal of
economic recovery.
	   The PM's Office minister concurred with Anand's observation that
the government had not kept in touch with the people on its
economic remedies.
	   ''Anand's comments should be heeded, because the success of
economic policies depends largely on the people's confidence,
cooperation and understanding,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid workers cut short relief
efforts Thursday as their overworked helicopters ran out of fuel,
forcing hundreds more earthquake victims in remote northern
Afghanistan to spend another night without food.
	   Pounding rains gave way to clear skies, allowing four small
helicopters to resume flights and evacuate villagers injured five
days earlier in the magnitude-6.9 quake that buried or toppled
entire villages. Nearly 5,000 people were believed to have been
killed.
	   But a supply of aircraft fuel destined for an airstrip in the
provincial capital of Faisabad was held up in nearby Tajikistan,
requiring the helicopters to return to Dushanbe airport to refuel
rather than continue delivering sacks of grain and tins of oil to
devastated villages.
	   ``We were expecting the fuel yesterday,'' said Rupert Colville,
a United Nations spokesman. ``The helicopters could have worked for
several more hours today. That means a lot more people will go
hungry tonight who didn't have to.''
	   Three aftershocks rocked the area Wednesday. A U.N. helicopter
landed at one village just as the temblor struck, sending a cloud
of dust into the air. Aid workers said villagers dropped to their
knees in prayer. They refused to enter their half-destroyed houses
to salvage belongings and food.
	   As many as 10,000 people could be facing serious food shortages,
said Colville.
	   The extent of the damage from Saturday's quake remained unclear,
with helicopter crews locating devastated villages not on aid
agencies' maps.
	   In nearby Shari Basurkh where medical tents have been set up,
aid workers said most of the wounded were women, old men and
children who were in their homes when the quake struck during the
late morning. Most of the men were in the fields.
	   Most people have not eaten since the earthquake hit.
	   ``They really worry about the future ... because they don't have
any shelter, any food. I think they have a very bad future,'' said
Abdul Rahim, a doctor in the village's clinic.
	   In Rostaq, also the site of an earlier quake in February that
killed 2,300 people, U.N. aid workers were setting up bakeries to
feed the hungriest.
	   There also was a desperate need for water. The nearest clean
water was 12 miles (19 kilometers) away after landslides buried a
fresh spring.
	   Wary of more aftershocks, thousands of people slept outdoors in
heavy rainstorms while waiting for supplies and medical attention
Wednesday.
	   Earlier, the rain increased the need for emergency tents and
plastic sheeting, even as it forced several aid flights to return
to Pakistan still laden with supplies.
	   Two Red Cross and one U.N. flight carrying medical workers and
supplies got through Wednesday.
	   Saturday's earthquake and the previous quake in February also
highlighted severe public health problems in Afghanistan's remote
poverty-stricken regions.
	   Many of those who sought medical treatment from aid helicopters
appeared to suffer from diseases predating the earthquake.

PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai moved swiftly Wednesday to

<TEXT>
consolidate the government's management of the economic crisis by
appointing his deputy, Supachai Panichpakdi, to temporarily oversee
the medium-term economic restructuring programme proposed by the
think tank Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).
	   The move is expected to end the government's uncertain economic
management which has previously tilted towards fiscal and monetary
policies as dictated by the International Monetary Fund -- which
has misjudged the extent of the domestic economic recession.
	   It also comes as the prime minister is due to announce the
government's social programme next week to counter accusations that
it has neglected the plight of the poor.
	   In a related development, Chuan held a one-hour meeting with
economic ministers, central Bank of Thailand Governor MR Chatu
Mongol Sonakul and top government economic advisers at Baan
Phitsanulok Wednesday to map out immediate economic strategies in
wake of the deterioration in the economic situation throughout the
region.
	   Government Spokesman Akrapol Sorasuchat said the economic crisis
hitting the entire region may force the government to delay the
implementation of its plan to issue bonds to boost domestic
financial liquidity.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda was quoted as informing
the meeting of four points the government would have to quickly put
into action to save the country from the current crisis: - Inject
monetary support into all needy sectors with maximum transparency.
	   - Issue bonds and implement financial measures under the four
executive decrees recently passed by Parliament.
	   - Prepare preventive measures to cushion any further impact from
the regional economic crisis on Thailand.
	   - Map out plans to restore local and global confidence in the
country's financial system.
	   Chuan Wednesday led all of his ministers to separately meet the
TDRI team led by chairman Anand Panyarachun, a former prime
minister, who last week urged the government to adopt a
comprehensive management strategy for the economic crisis,
including playing greater attention to the problems facing the
private sector, particularly lack of liquidity.
	   Chuan said Supachai and Tarrin were instructed to examine the
TDRI plans, which encompass economic restructuring to enable
Thailand to boost its international competitiveness at a sustained
pace and include implementation details.
	   The premier highlighted in particular the liquidity problem
facing the private sector and how Tarrin must balance the efforts
to stabilise the exchange rate and to inject liquidity into the
system. ''Lack of money remains a problem. The Export-Import Bank,
with available funding of Bt100 billion, will have to decide
whether it will become more involved in direct lending.'' Exim Bank
has been under pressure to make export-import loans from overseas
available to the export sector. But commercial banks, which act as
the intermediaries, have been reluctant to lend on the available
Exim funds because of their concerns over lending risks during this
economic slump.
	   Supachai said TDRI had proposed realigning the manufacturing
plans to complement the existing monetary policy and to explain to
the public that the government has to borrow from overseas due to a
lack of financial resources in the country.
	   ''Everyone talks about stimulation but we must have money,'' the
deputy prime minister said.
	   He added that both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
were considering expanding foreign capital inflows in line with the
IMF programme, but ''we must be careful not to encourage outflows.
Injection of money into the system is necessary''.
	   The minister was implicitly referring to the concerns of foreign
creditors and investors that Thai companies are going bankrupt
because of a lack of liquidity and high interest rates on top of
the currency depreciation impact.
	   Supachai said the economic stimulation policy was in the
pipeline, but did not provide details.
	   TDRI has proposed the use of the World Bank loan for economic
restructuring, to be managed by a national committee chaired either
by a deputy prime minister or finance minister.
	   Tarrin said he was speeding up disbursement of the funding for
exporters and hurrying to use the Bt50 billion budget for economic
stimulation as recommended by TDRI chairman Anand.
	   Anand said it was imperative for Thailand to improve all
non-financial sectors, from manufacturing to services, agriculture
to tourism, to boost the country's competitiveness.
	   He said he told the prime minister that the people should be
better informed about what the government has been doing so they
could contribute ideas and proposals.
	   The government distributed the TDRI's 50 pages of
recommendations to the government, which emphasise various reforms
to boost the country's competitiveness. They include improving the
quality of manpower, infrastructure, good governance, management
and science and technology.
	   ''Innovation lies at the heart of the sustained competitiveness
of Thailand,'' said the study.

TO CONSERVE banking licences for the next few years, Thai

<TEXT>
financial authorities are considering merging Radanasin Bank with
Krungthai Thanakit Plc and combining three nationalised banks into
a single entity.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul revealed
Wednesday after a meeting with Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda that the authorities have decided not to seek
foreign partners for Radanasin Bank now that it has no need to bid
for the assets of the 56 shut down finance companies to be
auctioned by the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
	   ''The second [FRA] decree that protects asset buyers after the
auctions should draw more bidders. Thus, the bank need not join the
bidding. It would be left doing business as usual and in the future
it could be merged with KTT if necessary,'' Chatu Mongol said.
	   Radanasin Bank, which is capitalised at Bt4 billion, was
initially to bid for the assets of the 56 shut down finance
companies. If it merges with KTT, the authorities can save a
banking licence.
	   Chatu Mongol said Wednesday that the central bank will sell only
one licence this year and the remainder in the next few years when
a healthier economy will increase the attraction of the licences.
Chatu Mongol said the sale of just one licence instead of four will
ensure the government receives a fair price for it. The remaining
three licences will be sold over three years.
	   KTT is to merge with seven financially-weak finance companies,
including Nava Finance Plc and Union Asia Finance Plc, and will be
awarded a banking licence. If it merges with Radanasin Bank later,
the authorities will take back one licence.
	   The Thai authorities have issued 16 banking licences, including
three to nationalised banks -- Siam City Bank, First Bangkok City
Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. Bangkok Bank of Commerce, a
nationalised bank, also risks revocation of its licence but as the
Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand is managing the bank well, the
authorities might not revoke the licence.
	   Chatu Mongol said the other three banks need to forge
partnerships with foreign investors.
	   ''If the three could not find partners, the authorities will
allow them to operate as state banks as due diligence proved their
asset quality is sufficiently good after the state's capital
injection,'' he said.
	   He said if the three are merged into a single entity, two
licences will be returned to the Bank of Thailand. If only two are
merged, the state will recover a licence.
	   Regarding the option to merge the three with Krung Thai Bank
(KTB), Chatu Mongol said Krung Thai Bank is not prepared because of
different operating systems. Moreover, it would be better if the
three could find foreign partners as that would bring in
international technology.
	   US investment bank JP Morgan Inc is advising the Bank of
Thailand on how to handle the banks' assets. It is to submit a
proposal to the central bank later this month, Chatu Mongol said.Dr
Supavud Saicheua, executive vice president of Phatra Securities
Ltd, said foreigners might not be interested in the sale of the
merged bank even though it will have over 300 branches nationwide
because they might be inclined to buy small banks.
	   However, if the purchase and assumption method is employed,
foreigners might be attracted because they would be able to
purchase only the good assets. However, this will leave a large
financial burden to the state.
	   He also opposes the idea of giving the good assets of the three
banks to KTB.
	   A source in the banking industry said several foreign banks are
interested in purchasing Thai banks. They include Citibank,
Hongkong Bank and West Landesbank.
	   ''However, they want only some parts of the banks. Certainly,
they will not take over bad debt burdens,'' he said.
	   It is believed Krungthai Thanakit is to shoulder the huge burden
resulting from its merger with seven other finance companies.
Standard  Poor's Wednesday affirmed its double-B long-term and
single-B short-term foreign currency ratings on KTT following the
announcement that seven finance companies recently taken over by
the Bank of Thailand will be merged into it. However, SP said the
outlook remains negative.
	   ''The use of Krungthai Thanakit by the the Bank of Thailand to
support and resolve problems in the finance-company sector
reaffirms Krungthai Thanakit's relationship with the Thai
government and its importance as a public-policy tool of the Bank
of Thailand,'' the ratings agency said.

Speakers at a roundtable conference on drug abuse in Bangladesh

<TEXT>
on Wednesday called for co-operation among the agencies dealing
with the issue, precise strategy, and vigorous enforcement of laws
to address this ever increasing problem.
	   Jointly organised by the Department of Narcotics Control, United
Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the United Nations
Information Centre (UNIC), the meeting was presided over by
Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Saifur Rahman.
	   Addressing the conference as chief guest, National Professor
Nurul Islam underlined the role of families, specially the parents,
who must take care of their children so that they (the children)
could not indulge to addiction to any kinds of narcotics.
	   He said that despite all measures it was yet to be possible to
ensure a society free from terrorism. ``Only the laws will not be
enough to stop all crimes; there should be proper enforcement of
the laws,'' he said.
	   Dr Syed Kamaluddin Ahmed, national consultant of the UNDCP, in
his key-note paper said that the drug abuse in Bangladesh was
increasing and easy availability of drugs was one of the reasons
for the growth.
	   Director General of Narcotics Control Department, Nazmul Ahsan
Chowdhury, admitted that his department was not well-equipped to
handle the ever increasing drug abuse in the country.
	   The DG said that beds in the hospitals set up for the treatment
of the drug addicts were not enough.
	   He stressed the need for participation of people from different
walks of life to make the task easier.
	   Home Secretary admitted that there were some flows in the
country's judicial and policing systems, but the government was
trying to improve the situation.
	   Former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Dr Enamul Haq, called
upon the International Narcotics Control Board to take steps so
that the countries that were permitting cultivation of opium could
not let their products go out of the respective countries.
	   He suggested amending the existing laws to plug loopholes
through which an offender could elude punishment.
	   General Secretary of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad Ayesha Khanam
also suggested for judicial reform immediately.
	   Among others, the conference was also addressed by Dr Nasir
Uddin, Professor MA Sobhan, journalist Jaglul Ahmed Chowdhury,
Selina Khaleq, National Information Officer of the UNIC Kazi Ali
Reza, Dr Hedayetul Islam and Khandker A Hafiz of the UNDCP.

AT least one third of 100,000 new jobs will be available within

<TEXT>
six months as part of a 12-point package of initiatives to bring
work and comfort to the jobless.
	   The measures were unveiled by Financial Secretary Sir Donald
Tsang Yam-kuen who chaired the first meeting of the taskforce on
employment yesterday.
	   While politicians generally welcomed the initiatives, leading
unionists slammed them as ``nonsense'', saying they would do little
to ease the worsening unemployment rate which has hit a 14-year
high of 3.9 per cent.
	   Under the government-led plan, another 56,000 mostly manual jobs
will be created next year while the remaining 11,000 jobs will be
civil service permanent posts available this fiscal year.
	   More than half of the new jobs will be created under the
expedited $305 billion infrastructure development and public works
program.
	   Another 11 measures in the package include enhancing employee
retraining by providing a longer retraining course, improving job
matching, promoting further education by expanding the number of
post-graduate courses, and tightening measures against illegal
employment.
	   The Financial Secretary said what they were doing was expanding
existing measures and accelerate the provision of jobs.
	   ``There is no perfect and quick cure to the unemployment problem
which does not result in high inflation,'' he said. ``We have
learnt from foreign experience that we should not do things
affecting the long term economic interest of Hong Kong.'' The
private sector and non-government organisations will provide 89,000
jobs _ including 22,000 permanent and 67,000 interim jobs _ in the
coming 18 months. About 18,000 of them will be professional and
managerial positions.
	   The government will spend at least $2 billion on various works
projects to provide 1,730 short-term jobs from two to six months'
duration.
	   The 1,730 posts will be created by accelerating public works
including various minor government maintenance works, the Tsing Yi
North Coastal Road project, and district-based minor environmental
projects.
	   ``It's sheer nonsense,'' unionist and elected legislator Leung
Yiu-chung said. ``It's just giving people false hopes. Some people
have been out of work for over a year and jobs must be created at
once, not over the next 11/2 years.'' Legislator-elect Lee
Cheuk-yan of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions said:
``The government is very stingy. It should increase public
expenditure and create new jobs.
	   ``These (100,000) jobs are not new. They are from committed
projects and the government is merely bringing them forward. Most
are temporary jobs.'' Sir Donald insisted the principle of
financial prudence should not be abandoned.
	   ``Economic recovery relies on maintaining an excellent
commercial environment and we should not forget our philosophy of
finance which underlies our success,'' he said.
	   Sir Donald said there were still new jobs provided in the labour
market and the challenge ahead was to improve job matching and
accelerate the provision of jobs.
	   The taskforce will meet every month and continue working until
the unemployment level returns to an acceptable level.
	   Sir Donald refused to say what an acceptable jobless level was
and made no predictions on the effect the government's measures
would have on bringing down unemployment.

JAKARTA -- In a report detailing the possible involvement of

<TEXT>
security forces in last month's riots in Jakarta, the Indonesian
Commission of Human Rights has called on the newly-installed
President B J Habibie's administration to investigate why troops
did not prevent or fight the riots.
	   Commissioner Asmara Nababan said on Tuesday the passive gesture
of the military during the riots had created an image that they had
tolerated the rioters, and demanded that the government look into
''an organisation'' which had started and triggered the rioting,
burning and looting between May 14 and May 16.
	   Unlike previous government statements which said only around 500
people were found dead in the riots, the commission also concluded
in a statement, signed by the board members of the commission, that
1,188 people had died.
	   When asked whether it could confirm rumours that there was a
plot to engineer the riots, commissioner Marzuki Darusman said the
public should not bank too much on it.
	   ''The Commission does not want to make statements of a
speculative nature. It is, therefore, important that the government
and the Armed Forces should explain openly the three big incidents
that had happened prior to the riots,'' he said.
	   Rumours circulating here said that in a bid to intimidate the
opposition, some elements of the military had kidnapped dozens of
human rights activists as well as shot dead four students at the
Trisakti University in Jakarta on May 12 which sparked public anger
and led to the riots.
	   Some army generals close to Lt-Gen Prabowo Subianto, the then
commander of the army strategic and reserve command, who is married
to the middle daughter of former president Suharto, Siti Hediyati,
were allegedly involved in the kidnappings and killings.
	   The rumours gained momentum especially after Prabowo was
abruptly replaced not more than 36 hours after his father-in-law,
who had been in power since 1965, decided to resign on May 21. Some
other generals were also demoted.
	   Many also believe that the riots, whose main victims were ethnic
Chinese Indonesians, were provoked to deflect public anger from the
Suhartos to the Chinese, a minority community which controls much
of the retail business.
	   A R T Kemasang of the University of Bradford in England, a
British specialist on anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia, whose thesis
on the 1740 massacre of the Chinese during the Dutch colonial
period had sparked some academic debate in the 1980s, told The
Nation in a telephone interview earlier this week that the pattern
of last month's riots was classic.
	   ''The Chinese are targeted by those whom I call 'political
bullies' who have no programme bar that of immediate short-term
gains,'' Kemasang said, adding that the attack on the Chinese was
instigated by agents provocateur working for Prabowo and
''backward-looking Muslims wanting to bring the whole situation to
anarchy in which they believe they could benefit by exacting
concessions from the military''.
	   Kemasang said that attacks against Chinese-descent Indonesians,
who have lived in Indonesia for generations and do not speak
Mandarin, are always orchestrated by those with vested interests,
hidden agendas or ulterior motives.
	   ''They [the riots] are not spontaneous. So it has nothing to do
with what the Chinese have done or not done. It has everything to
do with history, the fact that the Dutch had made them into a
problem minority for buffer-cum-scapegoat in the colonial
divide-and-rule,'' Kemasang said.

Iraq says the UN has no evidence that it still has banned weapons
</HEADLINE>
  By LEON BARKHO  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors have no evidence that Iraq
still possesses illegal arms, Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed
Rashid said Thursday.
	   ``If they have information (about weapons) let them give it to
us. We will verify it,'' Lt. Gen. Rashid told The Associated Press
hours after the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, presented
a report with charts and aerial photographs to the U.N. Security
Council.
	   Butler argued the Baghdad government failed to come clean about
its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.
	   The Security Council has said Iraq must eliminate all such
weapons before it will lift the sweeping sanctions imposed after
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Rashid accused Butler of acting in bad faith. For the U.N.
inspectors, ``it does not matter whether it is right or wrong. What
is important is to create doubts ... to block the lifting of
sanctions,'' he said.
	   He also said the inspector's program was orchestrated by the
United States, which with Britain, has insisted that Iraq comply
fully with Security Council resolutions on its disarmament.
	   The other permanent members of the council _ Russia, France and
China _ favor a speedy end to the sanctions, which virtually ban
trade with Iraq and have devastated the country's economy.
	   ``The area for maneuver for the American administration and its
front organization, that is the (U.N.) special commission (on
disarmament), has become very limited. They have run out of
games,'' said Rashid, a former chairman of Iraq's Military
Organization Commission.
	   Rashid reiterated that Iraq has nothing left to hide and said
the government would continue to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   A U.N. team is currently searching for parts of destroyed
missiles to verify Iraq's claim that it has scrapped all its
biological and chemical missile warheads.
	   Rashid said the inspectors know Iraq has no more missile
launchers or engines.
	   ``What is the importance of a warhead?'' he said. ``If you do
not have an engine or a launcher you have no missile.''

A COMMOTION broke out at the Kalasin provincial hall Wednesday

<TEXT>
when 40,000 farmers rushed to seek a five-year debt moratorium from
the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives.
	   Apparently confused by an incomplete report, the result of a
meeting between a farmers' group and a deputy secretary-general to
the prime minister, the farmers thought they would automatically
receive a debt moratorium by filling out a form at the provincial
hall.
	   Whe they found out that only 200 of the forms were available,
the farmers, who came from every district in the province, became
angry.
	   Upon learning the news, PM's Deputy Secretary General Amnuay
Pratise instructed the provincial administration to explain to the
farmers that not all of them would be granted debt moratoriums and
that they would have to meet two conditions.
	   On Tuesday, Amnuay met the Northeastern Farmers Coordination
Group and agreed to ask the BAAC to assist farmers in two areas.
First, the farmers could not repay loans to the BAAC because they
took part in government-initiated projects which failed or because
natural disasters had destroyed their products.
	   Second, the BAAC would be asked to provide new loans to farmers
to enable them to repay wealthy lenders or landlords. These farmers
would then benefit from a BAAC loan repayment holiday for five
years.
	   The farmers said they learnt of the application procedure from
the farmers' group but only two officials of the group received the
farmers.
	   The provincial administration said it knew nothing about a
resolution between Amnuay and the farmers' group and the 200 forms
were just sent to the administration Wednesday.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ New Zealand progressed to 122 for the
loss of five wickets from overnight 96 for 4 on a rain-affected
second day's play of the second Test against Sri Lanka at the Galle
cricket stadium on Thursday.
	   Craig McMillan was the only batsman who got out after playing
left arm spinner Niroshan Bandaratilleke's delivery onto his stumps
for 13.
	   There was no rain during the scheduled playing hours but one
large wet area square of the wicket created by overnight rains
prevented any play in the first two sessions.
	   Umpires Dave Orchard of South Africa and B.C. Cooray from Sri
Lanka made as many as four inspections to check on the offending
area as the sun scorched down.
	   The super sopper, a machine which drains out water, had a
mechanical failure, causing problems for the ground staff.
	   Finally, an hour's play was possible and New Zealand batted for
only 55 minutes before bad light ended what was left of the day.

DESPITE a rising anti-Chinese mood in the United States

<TEXT>
Congress, President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday his
decision to extend most favoured nation (MFN) trade status to China
for another year.
	   Describing his policy of engagement with China as an enticement
for Beijing to play a constructive global role, Mr Clinton also
cited ``concrete results'' in an area of chronic discord, human
rights.
	   ``For these reasons I intend to renew MFN status for China,'' Mr
Clinton told reporters at the White House Rose Garden.
	   Mr Clinton transmitted his decision to key officials of the
House of Representatives which, along with the Senate, has three
months in which to overturn the action.
	   However, observers expect Congress to endorse the decision as it
has every year since MFN has been debated in the wake of the 1989
Tiananmen crackdown. Hong Kong officials have long and successfully
argued in Washington that denial of MFN would have a sharper and
more immediate impact on Hong Kong than on the mainland.
	   In view of the Asian financial crisis and Hong Kong's ailing
economy, these arguments are expected to carry extra weight this
year.
	   To avoid an anti-China debate on the House floor on the eve of
his trip to China, Mr Clinton requested the House delay its vote
until after he returns.
	   The House Ways and Means Committee, which must approve any MFN
resolution before it goes to the floor, has tentatively scheduled a
hearing and possible vote on the issue on 17 June.
	   But it is not clear if the hearing will be in the full committee
or in its trade subcommittee.
	   The subcommittee chairman, Philip Crane of Illinois, is a free
trader and pro-MFN, who is pushing to hold the hearing in his
subcommittee, a move that would delay the House floor vote and
debate until after Mr Clinton returns from China. On the other
hand, the full committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas has opposed
MFN. If he succeeds in by-passing the trade subcommittee, the floor
debate could come at the time of Mr Clinton's trip.

<TEXT>
Quamruzzaman has called upon the people to join massively in the
long march on June 9 to force the government to scrap the peace
accord on the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
	   He was addressing a meeting of the presidents of all the city
units of the party which was held at its central office in the city
on Wednesday.
	   The meeting was presided over by the city Ameer of the party A T
M Azaharul Islam.
	   He said the government was hatching a conspiracy to sabotage the
long march programme of the seven opposition parties. But the
people will make this historic march a success in the face of all
provocations and transform it into a movement for pulling down out
the government from power, he added.
	   Quamruzzaman said the government had failed to run the country
during its 23 months rule.
	   The economy of the country was in ruins, he said and added that
the politics and culture of Bangladesh have become subservient to
the Indian hegemony and as a result the country has turned into
vassal state.
	   He said the government was plundering the resources of the
country and running propaganda against the Islamic values which the
people would resist, he said.

KRUNG Thai Bank urged exporters to join the bank's ''One Stop

<TEXT>
Service'' programme designed to ease their liquidity problems as
well as reduce costs.
	   KTB said the programme is offering a tax guarantee service for
exporters. Exporters can make tax payments and receive tax refunds
via the on-line system at the bank's service points located at the
Customs Department and the Port Authority of Thailand.
	   Through the on-line system between KTB and the Customs
Department, exporters can finalise the guaranteed credit line with
the bank on a one-time basis. When exporters import raw materials,
they can immediately submit the guarantee requisition form to the
bank, and the outstanding amount will automatically be deducted
from their accounts.Telecom agencies to brief staff on
privatisation EMPLOYEES of the Telephone Organisation of Thailand
and the Communications Authority of Thailand have been asked to
attend a series of seminars on privatisation to be held in major
provinces countrywide.
	   The state agencies want their staff to have a good understanding
of the issues and prepare for changes that will affect their work
and lives.
	   The first of 13 seminars to be organised up to Aug 28 will be
held in Khon Kaen tomorrow. Two seminars will be held in Bangkok
and the rest in Chiang Mai, Phitsanulok, Surat Thani, Ubon
Rathathani, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ayutthaya, Pattaya, Nakhon Prathom,
Hat Yai and Phuket.
	   Dr Thongchai Yongcharoen and Aswin Saowaros, the top executives
of the two organisations, will attend all 13 seminars, each of
which is expected to be attended by 1,000 participants.
	   Both agencies plan to give up their monopolies later this year
and be ready for liberalisation of the telecom industry early next
year.
	   GM adopts service strategy GENERAL Motors Thailand Co vice
president John Passadis recently headed a retailers meeting in
Bangkok to announce the auto-maker's Opel Plus+Program, which he
said would focus on customer satisfaction and retailer support.
	   ''1998 and 1999 will be a difficult time for all businesses, and
the motor industry will not be excluded as new vehicle sales
opportunities become difficult. GM therefore will work closer with
its retailers to focus on customer satisfaction and retention
through emphasising its resources on providing professional and
value servicing for its Opel customer,'' Passadis said.
	   The main elements of the programme are to continue developing
Opel facilities, provide focused training for retail staff, improve
parts availability and delivery time, support the analysis of
retailers' financial areas, focus on the Opel brand identity and
provide customer service promotions.
	   Name change for AST ASIA Securities Trading Plc (AST)
shareholders have approved changing the company's name and
appointed two additional directors, the firm has told the Stock
Exchange of Thailand.
	   The company said it had registered its new name, ABN Amro Asia
Securities Plc, with the Commerce Ministry on Tuesday but would
keep its AST abbreviation on the SET trading board.
	   The company also appointed Somsri Tanyacheevee and Kijja
Ngantavee directors.
	   NTS Steel reports profit NTS Steel Group Plc's has posted a
first-quarter net profit of Bt885.03 million compared to a net loss
of Bt222.60 million in the same period a year ago. Its
first-quarter earnings per share stood at Bt4.18 against a Bt1.05
loss per share last year.
	   BKI remains stable BANGKOK Insurance Plc is showing the
stability of its financial position with total assets of more than
Bt9.8 billion, claims Chai Sophonpanich, the company's chairman and
managing director.
	   Moreover the company has set aside risk reserves of more than
Bt1.24 billion, and its shareholders' equity stands at Bt4.5
billion.
	   Chai said that in the first quarter BKI had generated total
insurance premiums worth Bt1.37 billion, down 2.1 per cent from the
same period last year. Its net income from investment amounted to
Bt76.3 million, down 45 per cent from the first quarter of 1997,
but the company posted a profit rise from securities traded of
687.7 per cent to Bt108.3 million.
	   The company's net profit stands at Bt202.8 million and its
profit per share at Bt10.14.

HONG Kong people's condemnation of Beijing's actions in the

<TEXT>
Tiananmen Square crackdown has eased further, a survey shows.
	   At the same time, the perception of human rights on the mainland
is improving, while the percentage thinking Hong Kong people have a
duty to promote democracy there has declined.
	   The results, released on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the
military action, show 55.2 per cent believe Beijing did the wrong
thing, compared with 63.1 per cent in 1997 and 72.1 per cent in
1996.
	   The action was approved by 13.3 per cent, compared to 10 per
cent in 1997 and 6.5 per cent in 1996.
	   The rest were undecided.
	   The Social Science Research Centre of the Hong Kong University
interviewed 553 people for the survey at the end of last month.
	   The survey also shows a steady rise in the number of people who
think human-rights conditions have improved since 1989, the year of
the crackdown.
	   This view is held by 67.6 per cent this year, against 5.4 per
cent who say things are getting worse and 17.5 per cent who say
nothing has changed. Equivalent figures for 1997 were 63.2 per
cent, 3.8 per cent and 25 per cent and for 1996, 43.1 per cent, 8.7
per cent and 38.3 per cent.
	   Support for the activist group the Hong Kong Alliance in Support
of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China has fallen to 53.9 per
cent, down from 55.6 per cent last year and 59.5 per cent in 1996 _
almost unchanged from a year earlier.
	   A significant majority, 73.8 per cent, still agree that Hong
Kong people have a responsibility to instigate democratic
development in China, down slightly from 75.2 per cent last year
and almost 80 per cent in 1995.
	   Alliance spokesman Cheung Man-kwong said it was natural that
people tended to forget the crackdown as the years passed.
	   ``However, we will urge those who insist in supporting China's
democracy to continue their effort because democratisation needs
effort by lots of people pulling together,'' he said.

Communications Minister Anwar Hossain here on Thursday said the

<TEXT>
inauguration of the Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge on June 23, would
prove efficiency, skills and determination of Bangladesh people to
the world community,.
	   By making the dream of 12.5 crore people a reality, he said,
``it is now proven that we can accomplish any difficult task with
success.''
	   The minister was addressing as chief guest at a function,
organised on the occasion of formally opening the third
Dhaka-Narayanganj link road, at Chashara Shaheed Muktijoddha
auditorium here.
	   Local MP AKM Shamim Osman inaugurated the road. The
Communications Minister was accorded a reception on the occasion.
	   The eight-kilometre road, constructed at a cost of Tk 17.25
crore, has facilitated easier communications between the river port
and the capital, connecting the Dhaka-Chittagong highway at Mukti
Sarani with Chashara end near Rifles Club.
	   The road would shorten the journey by five kilometres comparing
to the Dhaka-Pagla-Narayanganj road, and thereby save the time of
the commuters considerably avoiding the traffic tangles at Fatullah
and Pagla.
	   He castigated the Opposition for planning a ``long march''
towards Chittagong Hill Tracts, saying they wanted to torpedo peace
and development process by new threats of violence.
	   The function was also addressed by Emdadul Huq Bhuiyan, MP,
Segufta Yasmin, MP, district Jatiya Party president Nasim Osman and
district Awami League president Nazma Rahman.

CRUDE palm oil physicals were quoted higher yesterday amid the

encouraging close on the futures market.
	   June-South rose RM10 to RM2,380 per tonne.
	   Sentiments were boosted by better export estimates released by
cargo surveyor, Societe Generale de Surveillance (M) Sdn Bhd, said
a dealer.
	   SGS estimated last month's exports to reach 628,079 tonnes
compared with 616,670 tonnes in April.
	   Meanwhile, crude palm oil futures on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange closed higher on the back of the export estimates.
	   Market sentiment was aided by the softening of the ringgit
against the US dollar, which made local palm oil relatively
cheaper.
	   June and July rose RM21 each to RM2,363 and RM2,335 per tonne,
respectively, while August rose RM17 to RM2,309.
	   Turnover declined to 2,210 lots from 2,376 lots on Friday.
	   Open positions stood at 6,614 contracts compared with 6,836
previously.

THARUWAT Ismail Bakti (mak yong exponent): ``It seems to me the

<TEXT>
State Government is killing whatever cultural heritage that
Kelantan has. First it was mak yong, now dikir barat... what next?
	   ``Just look at mak yong. Although it's not completely banned in
Kelantan, the performers are not encouraged to put up public
performances. That's why most of them have moved to Terengganu. For
the sake of the arts, they're willing to move to another State,
where they're free to perform.
	   ``Religion is religion. Culture is culture. Culture is part of
history and you can't just wipe it away.
	   ``Even the Muslim countries in the Middle East still retain
their cultural heritage, as long as it doesn't go against the
religion.
	   ``You have to supervise it, of course. It's rather silly to ban
the whole thing just because certain people are abusing the permits
issued to them.
	   ``If the authorities feel that vulgar language may be used in a
dikir barat performance, they should perhaps fine that particular
troupe or ban it temporarily.
	   ``By banning dikir barat altogether, they're depriving the
kampung folk of their regular activities. The people who issue
permits are the ones to be blamed. Before a permit is issued, they
ought to ask what kind of performance is being staged.''
	   Krishen Jit (playwright/theatre critic): ``I was very upset to
learn that it has been banned but the reasons for it don't seem to
be very clear. Dikir barat and mak yong are the core aspects of
Malay culture.
	   ``Dikir barat, for example, is an integral part of Malay society
in Kelantan. It's such a dynamic way of expressing social and
political matters. I find it very disturbing that the authorities
have decided to ban it.''
	   Azanin Ezane Ahmad (director-principal dancer-choreographer of
Suasana Cultural Centre): ``This is another example of people
misusing culture to their advantage. One has to follow procedures
when one is given a permit to put up a performance.
	   ``Then again, the authorities shouldn't ban dikir barat per se
if it's the organisers/promoters who are causing problems.''
	   Abdullah Cik Man (dikir barat performer): ``The State Government
has always been against pop/rock artistes doing concerts here. But
for the past month or so, promoters have been incorporating these
artistes into dikir barat shows.
	   ``I don't think it's right for the authorities to ban dikir
barat because of this. We abide by the rules so why are we made to
suffer? It's our bread and butter.
	   ``There are about 300 dikir barat troupes (in Kelantan), which
rely on performances for income. For the month of June alone, my
troupe is booked to perform every night. I really hope the State
Government will re-consider.''
	   Datuk Noordin Hassan (national laureate/playwright): ``I
understand the ban was imposed because the organisers have been
bringing in other artistes and camouflaging the shows as dikir
barat.
	   ``Perhaps the State Government shouldn't ban it straight away.
It should examine the line-up first and make sure that the shows
are free from unwanted elements.
	   ``It's a shame that Kelantan's indigenous traditional arts is
made to pay for the wrongdoing of others.''
	   Haji Mohamed Othman (cultural activist): Better known as Ayah
Mat, the 76-year-old was formerly a penghulu. In his heyday, he
used to bring cultural groups to perform in the whole of Malaysia.
How-ever, two years ago, he decided to take a rest.
	   Like most, Ayah Mat thinks it not a good idea to ban dikir barat
only because some people have ``abused'' the power given to them.
	   ``Kelantan is rich with culture but if you start to ban things,
everything will become extinct.
	   ``Banning dikir barat will only make matters worse. As it is,
our culture has been `tarnished'. I saw a dance performance
recently and was shocked to see how the dancers move onstage. When
they did the zapin, only the body was gracefully moved but their
feet were all over the place! ``A lot of today's youth are ignorant
of their own culture. They are more inclined towards Western
culture which flows into the country quite happily. Then again, can
you blame them?
	   ``I think the reason the authority ban dikir barat is because
the more recent ones had women participating in them. The old dikir
barat didn't have this element,'' said the dance exponent who used
to teach mak yong, menora, dikir barat, zapin, inai, etc at
Universiti Malaya.
	   ``Just think about it. There is no way we can control the influx
of foreign culture. And here we are, trying to kill our own.
Doesn't that say something? Who is at the losing end here?
	   ``I've seen some dikir barat performances in Singapore and Kuala
Lumpur but I must say they aren't quite as original as the ones you
find in Kelantan.
	   ``The ban would also mean we no longer have a channel to express
ourselves artistically.''

<TEXT>
Yuan Group has invested RM3 million in a new car showroom and
service centre at Perindustrian Taman Johor in Johor Baru.
	   Chuan Yuan Motor Credit Sdn Bhd opened two weeks ago as a
one-stop centre, replacing the company's old premises in Jalan Tun
Abdul Razak.
	   An EON franchise sales, parts and service dealer and agent for
four insurance companies, Chuan Yuan Motor Credit trades in new and
used Proton cars, offering financing to buyers as well.
	   Other companies in the Chuan Yuan Group, essentially a family
business involved in the motor and property business for the past
33 years, are Chuan Yuan Realty Sdn Bhd, Chuan Yuan Holdings Sdn
Bhd and Chuan Yuan Corporation Sdn Bhd.
	   ``Some say the time is not ideal to expand the business. But we
have been in the trade for so long and I would say we have a strong
foundation,''
	   said group executive director William Lee.
	   ``The good times will come. We are gearing for the good times.
We have strong faith in the economy,'' he said.
	   The Chuan Yuan Group also plans to start a 10-storey building
project costing RM10 million on a prime site in Jalan Wong Ah Fook
in Johor Baru by the end of this year or early next year.
	   Lee's father, Chin Chuan, is now the group managing director
while Lee's mother, Sally Lim, is the group chairman.
	   Lee's sisters, Lee May Hong and Lee Li Hoong, are the parts and
service manager and financial controller respectively.
	   Lee said the company posted a turnover of over RM40 million last
year.
	   ``February was our worst month in terms of car sales, but May
proved to be the best month so far this year,'' he said.

THE Bank of Thailand has issued regulations covering financial

<TEXT>
institutions' loan restructuring and collateral appraisals.
	   Here are the details of the regulations.
	   I. Debt Restructuring Regulations A. Objectives of Debt
Restructuring: Debt restructuring should be carried out to maximise
the financial institution's chances of repayment subject to the
debtor's ability to repay the loan, or in some other way improve on
the conditions set out in the original contract to both the
financial institution and the debtor.
	   B. Debt Restructuring Regulations: 1) The Bank of Thailand has
introduced regulations to require that financial institutions
establish a formal strategy for debt restructuring to cover every
stage of the restructuring process and clearly define each
individual's responsibility and accountability for restructuring
from the onset. The debt restructuring strategy must form part of
the institution's overall business policy. Financial institutions
are required to provide action plans and documentation, continued
monitoring and follow-up reports to ensure that the restructuring
process is carried out objectively.
	   In case where, directly or indirectly, the financial institution
and the debtor are affiliated, there is a conflict of interest. If
there is a conflict of interest, a third party must be appointed to
evaluate the debtor's circumstances and ability to repay the loan
in accordance with the new contract proposed including the debtors
projected future cash flows for present value estimations except in
cases where the financial institution is affiliated with or has
interests in the debtor due to its involvement to help solve the
debtor's troubled debt difficulties.
	   2) Where the financial institution in a troubled debt
restructuring grants a concession to the debtor resulting in a loss
(to the financial institution), the institution must recognise the
loss from restructuring in its profit and loss statement for that
accounting period following internationally accepted accounting
standards. These standards stress the use of the present value
approach to calculate the new net book carrying value of the loan,
using the effective interest rate of the original loan as the
discount rate.
	   To provide financial institutions with an adjustment period
until the end of the year 2000, institutions may use the collateral
valuation method instead of the present value approach to calculate
the loss from restructuring where the collateral valuation must be
carried out in accordance with BOT regulations. In addition,
financial institutions may phase in the additional provisions
required for losses on restructuring up to Dec 31, 2000.
	   3) After restructuring, financial institutions may reclassify
loans originally classified as ''doubtful'' or ''loss'' as
''substandard''. After the debtor has serviced and paid the agreed
interest on the restructured loan for a minimum of three months or
has made at least three repayments (agreed interest and/or
principal) on the restructured loan (whichever period is longer),
the financial institution may re-classify the loan as normal. In
cases where debtors cannot meet the obligations of the restructured
contract, financial institutions must immediately re-classify the
loan as impaired following the guidelines issued by the BOT.
	   II. Regulations for Collateral Valuation and Appraisal A.
Objectives:The regulations for collateral valuation and appraisal
are to be used to estimate collateral value in order to calculate
the required provisions for possible loan loss, and the required
provisions for the impairment loss on debt restructuring subject to
the BOT's regulations for loans classification and debt
restructuring.
	   B. Collateral Valuation and Appraisal Regulations: BOT
regulations do not apply to all loan collateral, but require that
financial institutions use independent appraisers to estimate the
collateral value in certain cases, dependent on the book value of
the loan and the size of the institution's capital fund.
	   With regards to collateral appraisal, appraisers must be
independent of lending, investment and collection processes and
must not be directly or indirectly related with the debtor, or have
an interest in the collateral itself. In-house appraisers must
conform to generally accepted appraisal standards and codes of
conduct set by professional asset appraisal associations as well as
guidelines set by the Thai Bankers' Association and the Association
of Finance Companies which have been approved by the BOT. For all
collateral, valuations and appraisals must be presented in writing,
backed by the appropriate data and analyses.
	   In addition, financial institutions must carry out collateral
appraisals or valuations at least once a year. Where the collateral
appraisal was carried out within six months previous, financial
institutions may deduct the book value of the loan by up to 90 per
cent of the collateral value. Where the appraisal was carried out
over six months previous, institutions may deduct the book value of
the loan by up to 50 per cent of the collateral value.
	   III. Effective Date The regulations for collateral valuation and
appraisal are to be used to estimate collateral value in order to
calculate the required provisions for possible loan loss subject to
the BOT's loan classification regulations, effective from July 1,
1998.
	   Similarly, the regulations are to be applied to estimate
collateral value in order to calculate the required provisions for
the impairment loss on debt restructuring, effective from June 2,
1998.

A severe loadshedding for 18 hours plagued the port city for the

<TEXT>
second consecutive day on Thursday.
	   PDB officials said power generation in the country dipped to
1481 megawatt and indicated no sign of improvement at least for the
next three days.
	   As many as nine 33-kv substations in Chittagong were rendered
inoperative without prior intimation.
	   City Mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury Tuesday night faxed a message
to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina informing her of the grave
situation.
	   The Mayor said it was earlier decided that Chittagong will bear
16 per cent of the country's loadshedding. ``It is now more than
double,'' he said and sought the Prime Minister's intervention.
	   Today Mohiuddin Chowdhury travelled to Bandarban to personally
meet the Prime Minister and explain the gravity of the situation
that arose out of the loadshedding.
	   Even the export processing zone and the export-oriented garments
industry were not exempted from the power outage.
	   BGMEA Vice-President Mahbub Ali told the agency that production
loss in garment factories due to loadshedding in Chittagong would
amount to Tk 50 lakh a day.
	   ``What worry us more is that most of us will not be able to
maintain the shipment schedule, risking cancellation of
contracts'', he said.
	   PDB officials said power generation in Kaptai Hydel Project is
suspended during the day time when garbages are being cleared by
the people, including army personnel.
	   The Kaptai project, which was generating 230 megawatt
electricity, is now generating not more than 100 megawatt. The
existing situation will continue for three more days, officials
said.

Jordan, U.S. conclude three weeks of military exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QATRANA, Jordan (AP) _ The United States and Jordan on Thursday
wound up three weeks of joint military maneuvers which officials
said boosted Jordanian combat skills and acquainted the Americans
with desert war tactics.
	   Around 4,000 sailors and Marines from the U.S. Fifth Fleet and a
similar number of Jordanian soldiers from the 40th Battalion took
part in the exercises, codenamed ``Infinite Moonlight 98.''
	   Land exercises were held in this desert town, 120 kilometers (70
miles) south of Jordanian capital, Amman, while naval drills were
conducted in the Red Sea port of Aqaba, 230 kilometers (145 miles)
further south.
	   Facing a simmering sun and desert dust, around 1,400 U.S.
Marines and 800 Jordanian soldiers cannonaded a dummy target here
in a one-hour mock war at the conclusion of the exercises.
	   U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan told reporters at the site that the
war games were part of annual exercises under continuing military
cooperation with Jordan.
	   Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Merei Kaabneh, chief of staff of the
Jordanian Armed Forces, said the exercises boosted Jordanian
defense skills.
	   Lt. William Mitchell of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit said
``the U.S. has gained tremendous experience of Jordan's
environment.''
	   He said the three-week maneuvers included squad- and
platoon-level tactics. There were also medical and dental teams who
provided services to the local population.
	   Since Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
Washington has since donated dlrs 300 million worth of military
supplies, including 16 F-16 jet fighters, tanks and helicopters to
the kingdom.
	   The United States conducts joint exercises with several Arab
countries, including Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

Red Cross resumes operations in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red
Cross said Thursday that it has resumed operations in war-torn
southern Sudan after a 19-month suspension due to disagreements
with both the government and rebels.
	   As of Monday, ICRC delegates began flying to the government-held
towns of Malakal, Juba and Leer and to rebel-held Yei, Turalei,
Malwakon and Yirol.
	   An ICRC statement said delegates will also visit an additional
15 locations controlled by both Khartoum and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army to assess relief needs.
	   The statement said Khartoum and SPLA have dropped allegations of
partisanship against the Swiss-run organization ``and the parties
in conflict have given the necessary safety guarantees.''
	   The ICRC suspended operations in November 1996 after a rebel
faction allied with the government seized a relief plane and three
Red Cross workers.
	   The plane was returning to southern Sudan five SPLA fighters who
had been treated in the Kenyan border town of Lokichogio, where
ICRC operates a hospital.
	   Sudan claimed the plane was carrying arms for the rebels, which
ICRC denied. The Red Cross workers and the pilot were freed after
37 days following intervention by the United States.
	   The SPLA was angered by what it said was ICRC's failure to
secure the release of its fighters.
	   ``We were not convinced they made enough efforts to have our
people freed,'' John Luc Jok, SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, said
Thursday.
	   John Luc said the five later rejoined rebel ranks.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.

SEVEN political parties, which together command a majority in

<TEXT>
the new Legislative Council, have served notice they will use their
clout to force their views on the economy through the legislature.
	   The parties, which between them hold 42 of the 60 seats in the
new Legco, yesterday put aside their differences and put together
their own package to stimulate the economy and help ease
unemployment.
	   ``We are more or less the majority in the legislature, and we
will push for these proposals to get through,'' said Liberal Party
chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei.
	   He acted as convenor of the round table meeting although he lost
in the legislative election last month.
	   ``We certainly hope the government will seriously consider and
agree to our proposal because it is difficult for us, for all the
parties, to agree on something.'' The package calls for rates and
fuel tax cuts, a delay in provisional taxes, for infrastructure
projects to be brought forward and for social services projects to
receive rapid approvals.
	   The new alliance consists of the Democratic Party, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, the Liberal
Party, the Citizens Party, the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, the
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, and The
Frontier.
	   Their representatives emerged from a round table meeting
yesterday convinced the economic package they plan to put to the
administration would go a long way towards curing high unemployment
and put the brakes on the economic downturn.
	   Their proposal to cut taxes was made despite Financial Secretary
Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen stressing last week that reductions would
be impossible because local taxes were very low already.
	   ``We are also in a very strong position to urge the government
to accept our proposal,'' DP vice-chairman Yeung Sum said.
	   The parties also asked for property rates to be cut by 1 per
cent, a reduction in public utility charges, including fares on the
MTR, KCR and LR, and retail rentals payable to the government.
	   Mr Lee expected the government would lose $3.5 billion in
revenue if it were to accept the property rates cut alone.
	   ``If these policies should result in a deficit in the Budget
next year, we will support the Budget deficit,'' he said.
	   ``Now there's a rainstorm out there. The government should
provide us, the Hong Kong people, with umbrellas.
	   ``We have a very rich government that can afford huge spending,
but we the poor citizens, are suffering and we have now a poor
business operating environment outside,'' Mr Lee said.
	   One very striking aspect of the alliance is the inclusion of the
Hong Kong Progressive Alliance.
	   Chairman Ambrose Lau Hon-chun has always been extremely
pro-Beijing and an avowed supporter of the Tung administration.

ELECTROLUX Thailand Ltd has adjusted its marketing strategy,

<TEXT>
focussing on direct selling through the Electrolux Home Center
after suffering a plunge in sales by dealers and orders for housing
projects in the first five months of this year.
	   Electrolux has also formed a marketing alliance with various
products and service providers to launch a heavy price-cut
promotional campaign to mark its 10th anniversary in Thailand this
year.
	   The channel adjustment was made after the company faced a sales
decline in the dealers channel and modern-trade outlets as well as
housing projects.
	   The Electrolux Home Center is a one-stop shopping showroom for
Electrolux kitchen furniture and home appliances. The company has
15 outlets, including four upcountry.
	   Given the economic difficulties, the company hopes for modest,
single-digit growth at its showrooms this year, while sales through
dealers and modern-trade retail channels as well as housing
projects are expected to plunge by 10 to 50 per cent.
	   Vichai Lorattawoult, general manager for household appliances,
said most housing developers had frozen their projects amid the
economic downturn and the slump in the property market, leading to
a 50-per-cent fall in the number of orders for new housing estates.
	   Meanwhile the company has posted a fall in retail sales,
especially at department stores and dealers, as the spending power
of consumers declines.
	   Vichai added that the company expected stable sales at its
Electrolux Home Center showrooms given the target clients of
middle- to high-income earners who had not been severely affected
by the economic slow-down. ''These groups still have great
purchasing power, and many of them now have more time for their
homes,'' said Vichai.
	   Electrolux Thailand Ltd reported sale revenues of Bt1.4 billion
last year, of which Bt190 million came from its showrooms.
	   Vichai said the company would start expansion of its centres
next year with a plan to open one-stop service showrooms in Bangkok
and selected provinces including Khon Kaen, Surat Thani and
Phitsanulok. Each showroom, with retail space between 150 and 200
square metres, requires a minimum investment of over Bt15 million.
	   To celebrate the Electrolux Home Center's 10th anniversary, the
company will cut the prices of its home appliances and kitchen
cabinets by 5-20 per cent. It will also enter into sales
arrangements with the Gatineau beauty institute, Jubilee Diamond,
the Body Shop, Sizzler restaurant, Travel Vision tour agency, Royal
Porcelain and Maitun Resort Phuket using discount coupons.
	   Vichai said the company had opened a local workshop to assemble
imported knock-down kitchen-furniture parts from Sweden with the
aim of reducing transportation costs and import tax.
	   The company can reduce costs by 40 per cent by assembling
kitchen furniture locally.

The teachers of non-government primary schools called off their

<TEXT>
hunger strike programme at 8-25 pm on Wednesday at the Osmani
Uddyan after accepting food and drink from Awami League Presidium
member, Amir Hossain Amu, who is also the Chief Adviser of the
Bangladesh Prathomik Shikkhak Oikya Parishad.
	   Prior to offering food and drink to the striking teachers, Amir
Hossain Amu, in a brief address, said that the Awami League
government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was trying
relentlessly to resolve the problems of the teachers. She is also
trying to solve the problems faced by the educational institutions,
he added.
	   State Minister for LGRD and Cooperatives, Mofazzal Hossain
Chowdhury Maya, Nurul Islam Nahid, MP, Whip Mujibul Huq, Convenor
of the Bangladesh Primary Shikkhak Oikya Parishad Prof. Abdul
Mannan Chowdhury, Joint Convenor of the Oikya Parishad Sufia Khatun
and General Secretary of the Bangladesh Non-government Primary
Teachers Association Akkas Ali Sheikh, among others, spoke at the
function marking the end of the hunger strike.
	   Later, a delegation of the Primary teachers met with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina at her office.
	   The Prime Minister said the government will take all possible
measures so the teachers of the country can lead a respectable
life.
	   ``Teachers are involved at the grass root level to make the
future generation worthy citizens,'' she said.
	   Hasina told the teachers that despite resources constraint, the
government is ready to do as much as possible for them.
	   Earlier, two rounds of informal dialogue were held between the
leaders of the teachers association and the Awami League in the
city on Wednesday aimed at resolving the issue. The ruling party
representatives at the talks offered a 10 per cent hike in the
teachers' salaries, said an insider of the dialogue adding that the
offer was accepted by the striking teachers. As a consequence, the
teachers decided to call off their programme, he added.
	   The ruling party was represented by Amir Hossain Amu, Prof.
Abdul Mannan Chowdhury and Nurul Islam Nahid at the on Wednesday's
talks while the teachers association was represented by its
President Shamsul Alam and General Secretary Akkas Ali Sheikh.

EX-GOVERNOR Chris Patten posed for a snapshot in the Philippines

<TEXT>
with a tobacco executive wanted by Hong Kong graft-busters, a jury
was told yesterday.
	   The picture shows Jerry Lui Kin-hong, currently standing trial
on $33 million bribery charges, standing at Mr Patten's right
shoulder, the court was told.
	   It was taken on 15 December, 1995 during a luncheon held for Mr
Patten who was touring Subic Bay, at which time Lui was an
executive of Giant Island. Lui was the target of a probe by the
Independent Commission Against Corruption, the court heard.
	   Defence counsel Kevin Egan produced the photograph for the jury
at the Court of First Instance to demonstrate that Lui was not
``behaving like a fugitive and hiding away so no one could find''
him.
	   ``You were introduced to Governor Patten and his party?'' Mr
Egan asked. ``Yes I was invited together with Mr Patten to take
part in this luncheon,'' Lui replied.
	   Lui denies conspiring to accept advantages between August 1988
and May 1993.

INDEPENDENT oil retailers continued their expansion during the

<TEXT>
first quarter of this year with the number of outlets increasing by
60 per cent to 5,628, according to a report from the Commercial
Registration Department.
	   However, outlets under the trademarks of Article 6-registered
oil companies grew by only 3 per cent to 7,098.
	   The overall number of petrol outlets as of the end of March
totalled 12,726, an increase of 22 per cent over the same period
last year, it said.
	   CRD Director General Noravat Suwan said the expansion rate was
similar to last year's despite the economic turmoil.
	   The state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand retained its
leading position with 1,526 outlets followed by Bangchak (1,209),
Shell (1,034), Esso (861) and Caltex (601).
	   Among the major players, Bangchak showed the fastest expansion
rate of 9 per cent followed by Caltex which grew 7 per cent. Shell
was the only oil trader cutting the number of its fuel outlets, by
3 per cent.
	   Petro Asia (PA) had the largest number of oil stations among the
small retailers, with 440. Paktai Chuepueng (PT) had 351 outlets
and Siam United Services, 222. However, the fastest expansion was
recorded by Quwait Petroleum (Q8) which saw its outlets grow by 26
per cent, with Sukhothai Petroleum growing by 25 per cent and
Conoco (Jet) 22 per cent.
	   By the end of the first quarter, the northeastern region had
attracted 35 per cent more outlets for a total of 4,323, the
highest among all regions. The number of new fuel outlets grew by
30 per cent in the central region, 21 per cent in the East, 13 per
cent in the Bangkok's metropolitan areas, and 11 per cent in the
South.
	   In April, the department awarded operating licences to 345
entrepreneurs for 359 new service stations.
	   Despite the economic crisis, Noravat said the department will
award more oil station licences this month because the oil
marketing margin has increased to Bt1.50 a litre from Bt1.20.

The Government is actively considering the 5-point demand of the

<TEXT>
non-government primary teachers' and sincerely working to fulfil
those in phases, an official announcement said on Wednesday.
	   It said the government hopes the teachers will withdraw their
hunger strike.
	   The teachers' memorandum has been accepted on behalf of the
Prime Minister, and it is now being reviewed, according to the
announcement by the Prime Minister's office.
	   ``Due to the keen interest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the
government is actively considering gradual implementation of the
5-point demand of non-government primary teachers,'' it said.
	   The government grant for the non-government primary teachers'
has been upgraded in line with the new pay scale for government
primary teachers.
	   Three categories of non-government teachers will now get Tk
812.50, Tk 1007.50 and Tk 1153.75 per month instead of Tk 525, Tk
651 and Tk 745 paid earlier. They will receive arrears from July
1997.
	   The government has granted additional Tk 31.47 crore to pay the
upgraded grants in the current fiscal year.
	   Moreover, the Prime Minister has directed to raise the teachers'
salary and allowances in phases in every budget.
	   Other steps taken by the government include introduction of
service books for non-government primary teachers, C-in-Ed training
for them under two projects aided by the World Bank and NORAD, and
raising the age limit to 50 years for C-in-Ed training.

THAILAND Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to hold a dialogue

<TEXT>
in an effort to diffuse tension and create understanding vital for
building confidence and paving the way to peace and stability in
the region.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told new Indian Ambassador to
Thailand Rajendra Kumar Rai who was on a formal courtesy call, of
the country's concern.
	   Chuan said India and Pakistan are good friends of Thailand which
hopes to see peace and stability in South Asia.
	   India conducted five nuclear tests from May 11-13 while Pakistan
detonated six nuclear bombs from May 28-30.
	   The envoy reaffirmed India's position that it will observe a
voluntary moratorium and refrain from conducting underground
nuclear test explosions.
	   He said Chuan had already been informed of the nuclear tests in
a letter sent by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on May 18.
	   Rai also reiterated India is ready to discuss a ''no-first-use''
agreement with Pakistan and other countries either bilaterally or
in a collective forum.
	   The Indian government proposed last month that India and
Pakistan jointly undertake not to be the first to use their nuclear
capabilities against each other.
	   Rai said the relationships between India and its neighbouring
countries are good and not as negative as been depicted by the
media.
	   He said the government is promoting nuclear energy for peace and
is preparing to sign nuclear treaties. He added the tests were not
directed against any particular country.
	   India has exported no nuclear weapons, he added.

THE Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has banned the practice of

<TEXT>
allowing issuers the option to settle in either cash or scrip for
warrant issues.
	   The stock exchange said the amendment to the listing rules was
in response to the recommendations of the working group on the
derivatives market.
	   The change takes effect immediately.
	   Issuers will be required to specify at the launch whether the
warrant will be settled in cash or scrip.
	   The formula for cash settlement has also been amended.
	   The working group also recommended that the percentages of the
issue taken by the top five places be disclosed as this would
increase market transparency.
	   A stock exchange spokesman said these amendments would come into
force on 10 July.
	   These include the requirement that guarantors have minimum net
assets of $2 billion and either a credit rating in one of the top
three investment grades, or be regulated by a regulator acceptable
to the exchange.
	   ``Some other practices that have arisen since 1996 Rule
amendments have been incorporated into the rules and also take
immediate effect,'' the spokesman said.
	   He said the timetable for submission of documents supporting
derivative warrant listing applications had been amended to reflect
current processing times.
	   Also, issuers will no longer have to make a second announcement
of the launch of an issue two days before dealing commences, and
the minimum life of a warrant has been reduced to six months.
	   ``Listed warrants will now be classified as either
collateralised or non-collateralised to reflect their nature more
clearly,'' he said.
	   The working group's objectives include considering the
appropriateness of the regulatory framework of the derivative
warrants market, and identifying areas where market transparency
could be increased.

U.N. inspectors challenge Baghdad's claims it has destroyed illegal

weapons  
  Eds: UPDATES with Iraq challenging Butler's allegations  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said Thursday it is not hiding
illegal weapons, despite the chief U.N. weapons inspector's claims
to the contrary.
	   The Security Council was scheduled to meet at 10:30 a.m. (1430
GMT) Thursday for a second straight day to hear the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, give a briefing on the arms inspection
program. During Thursday's session, Butler is expected to speak
about Iraq's alleged secret program to hide weapons and illegal
materials.
	   France is urging him to outline what steps Iraq must take before
the council can lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the
Gulf War.
	   Butler hopes his presentations will convince the council that
Iraq is wrong when it claims to have complied with U.N. orders.
Russia, China and France have challenged some of Butler's
conclusions.
	   In Baghdad, Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rashid, accused
Butler of bad faith and renewed claims that Baghdad has complied
with U.N. orders.
	   ``If they have information (about weapons) let them give it to
us,'' Rashid told The Associated Press. ``We will verify it.'' He
said Butler was trying to raise doubts among council members ``to
block the lifting of sanctions.''
	   On Wednesday, Butler presented aerial photographs and other
documents to justify his claims that Iraq has failed to comply with
U.N. orders, issued after the 1991 Gulf War, to destroy all
long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Butler showed photographs that suggested the Iraqis had buried some
missile parts and then dug them up after the inspectors left.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's report ``has dealt
a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility'' with ``document and
charts that catalogue the gaps and inconsistencies in Iraqi claims
in the chemical, biological and other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
and indicated that Iraq has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions.
	   ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to do,'' he said.
	   But diplomatic sources said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet
argued that despite changing its story on several occasions, Iraq
had ultimately provided accurate information in some areas.
	   Dejammet urged Butler to outline clearly what steps Iraq must
take to satisfy the inspectors. Diplomats said Russian envoys also
questioned some of Butler's conclusions.
	   Pressure has mounted on Butler since Secretary-General Kofi
Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open Saddam's
palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access. But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.

There is an acute crisis of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in

<TEXT>
Rajshahi City. Rationing of the refuelled cylinders which started a
year ago has further worsened the situation. The consumers of the
LPG complained that after the rationing of the LPG was introduced,
not a single refuelled gas cylinder could be made available during
the last seven months.
	   A refuelled gas cylinder which costs Taka 260 under the
rationing system is sold between Taka 550 and 600 in the
clandestine market, many consumers alleged. Dishonest gas dealers
of the city are allegedly selling gas in black market at a price
which is twice the fixed rate.
	   The residents of Rajshahi are facing an acute shortage of
cooking fuel. The firewood is scarce in the city markets and is
often sold between Taka 110 and 160 per maunds. The electric heater
is restricted to household use only.
	   The price of kerosene is also sky-rocketing.
	   The middle and low-income group of people have been hardest hit
by the LPG crisis. The government employees in the police and other
departments of the administration in the Rajshahi City are enjoying
a ``special quota'' of LPG. But the common people of the city are
deprived of any such privilege.
	   Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) sources said that there
are 191 LPG dealers in the Rajshahi Division. About one lakh 20
thousand gas cylinders are required in the division per month
whereas the monthly requirement of the Rajshahi city is about
30,000 cylinders. At present the entire Rajshahi division gets a
supply of only one tenth of its total requirement.
	   BPC sources said, a total of 28778 refuelled gas cylinders were
supplied in July last year which was the highest number of
cylinders supplied that year. The Eastern Refineries in the past
used to supply 5100 refuelled cylinders per month to the northern
districts but recently the supply has halved, the sources added. At
present only a limited number of LPG cylinders are supplied from
the Baghabarighat which cannot meet the demand.

TV viewers must have felt that they were watching rogues'

<TEXT>
galleries on Tuesday when the activities of political parties were
on the air. There were faces with beaming smiles all around,
brimming with hope that life would become more exciting from now
on.
	   Their unequivocal message was that they were prepared to take on
the nation by the votes of their constituents and it did not matter
if their election success meant another severe blow to the
country's unending economic misfortunes.
	   Of course, they were the same familiar faces associated with the
gutter politics which has gradually destabilised the economy and
bred corruption and all sorts of political villainy.
	   There were hardly any qualified newcomers among the ranks to
raise public expectations that the country's future might be better
off under a new electoral system, though the polling date has yet
to be decided by Prime Minister Chuan's government.
	   To many the gatherings represented a political horror show
further demoralising a people who have been hard hit by economic
hardship. These politicians were without remorse, repentance,
proportion and shame as they displayed their determination to be in
government.
	   The new electoral system will be tough going for notorious
political parties whose members have repulsive behaviour. They must
find 100 respectable persons for their respective party lists,
whereby 300 MPs are to be elected through a one-MP constituency
system.
	   Don't ever think that these scandal-numbed politicians will be
discouraged by the obstacles erected by the new Constitution. The
bags of tricks have been well replenished with new means to get
around the rules and penetrate the loopholes they will surely spot.
	   Then the Democrats and their allies want to remain in office for
as long as possible. The public understands that their mission to
rescue the economy remains far from any first sign of success. An
election, which even the opposition is less inclined to seek at the
moment, will be expensive.
	   Not only that. It is more disheartening when it has been
predicted that at least 80 per cent of the incumbent MPs will be
back in the House. Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan has uttered
aloud that an election should be held for the sake of just having
one, without a promise of improvement on the present situation.
	   It certainly looks so. Major changes would be that MPs would be
jockeying hard for their names to be on the party list so as to be
eligible for ministerial posts. Since there will be only 36 Cabinet
members under the new Constitution, the fight will be tougher and
bloodier.
	   At present a worrisome factor for the Democrats is that their
allies the defectors from the Prachakorn Thai Party may not be
around for long if they are eventually evicted from the party.
Without the dirty dozen branded ''cobras' by party leader Samak
Sundaravej, the government's already slim majority in the House
will be razor-thin.
	   The outcome of their efforts to seek legal entanglements to
thwart an undesirable end will determine whether the Chuan
coalition will call a general election sooner than expected.
	   What happened in Prachakorn Thai was no surprise. The Democrats
have seen what is to come. They are simply waiting for it to happen
before they make a counter-move to thwart further attempts by the
opposition to rock Chuan's statecraft.
	   Elsewhere, the Chat Pattana Party showed the public there was no
rift among its leaders despite previous rumblings. Party
heavyweights put on smiling faces to quash rife speculation that
Korn Dabaransi and Suwat Liptapallop might soon part company in
contention to succeed the late Gen Chatichai Choonhavan as party
chief.
	   The public can only take their words at their ''face'' value, as
seen through TV cameras. Things will become clearer when the date
of the next general election is announced.
	   For a while, the spotlight was on the New Aspiration Party,
where a long-publicised internal power struggle was effectively
subdued by means of the disintegration of power earlier vested in
party secretary-general Snoh Thienthong.
	   There was no challenge to the underboss, despite earlier
speculation that Chingchai Mongkoltham would formally seek to
fulfil his ambition to succeed Snoh. The younger man seems to have
realised that it was still not his day.
	   NAP leader Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was re-elected, as
expected, thus making him a contender for premiership. The man
still wants to undo the severe damage he has done to the economy.
	   What was very interesting was that a few academics had become
fully fledged NAP members. There was no pretence any more. They
will no longer be treated as academics, whose views should be
balanced and objective.
	   Of course there is nothing wrong with academics who want to
either jump on political bandwagons or hang on the coat-tails of
politicians for fame and fortune if they can provide some sort of
intellectual contribution.
	   It is not difficult to discern whether their active role in
politics is a noble cause. Neither is there any harm done if their
notable presence adds more colour to the existing stripes. But do
they consider themselves clean water to dilute the pollutants in
the gutter?
	   The public, in any case, can judge them by the company they
keep. Prejudging somebody as guilty by association is possible in
politics.
	   Will they serve as new selling points? At least the parties that
embrace them hope so. The voters will give the final verdict when
election day comes round.

LIFE has a habit of throwing you a curve ball every now and

<TEXT>
then, just to keep things interesting. I mean, I've been sitting
here for over an hour, staring at a blank pad of paper, fiddling
occasionally with all the bits of debris that have taken up
residence on my desk and not writing a word.
	   The unsullied paper returns my ferocious stare with virginal
scorn. My brain, so full of ideas a while ago, has sailed into the
doldrums and now sits in its own reflection on a glassy sea, sails
slatting idly in the pitch and yaw of intemperate thoughtlessness,
an idiot grin on the captain's bewhiskered chin.
	   And then, something completely and utterly out of the ordinary
happens: a plate with two cheese and tomato sandwiches appears at
my elbow. Not a particularly odd apparition, you might say, but it
has been enough to get me to the bottom of paragraph two - and that
is nothing short of miraculous.
	   Philosophy is that simple and important. One moment you are
pondering your place in the universe and the reason for your
existence - and the next; you have to factor in the reality of a
cheese and tomato doorstep.
	   Forget whether the tree falling in the forest makes a noise or
not -where did this sandwich come from - and how did the maker of
this sandwich manage to put the mayonnaise on upside down?
	   I still get unduly excited about the prospect of debating a
philosophical question or idea. I think that this dates back (way
back) to my rejection of ``That's just the way it is, kid'' adults,
who seek to cut off the debate before it even begins. Part of
growing up is having to pass through the phase where every question
begins with the first syllable of ``whine'' and HAS to be directed
at a big, old person. ``Why is the sky blue?'' ``Why won't rain
fall upwards?'' ``Why can't everybody just like everybody else?''
``Why do apoplectic Sunday School teachers always turn red before
they do the cross-eyed seal impression?''
	   I learned to dread the ``That's just the way it is, kid''
answer, almost as much as the ``You just have to take that on
faith, son'' answer. They told me nothing more than the fact that
the adult-type person either didn't know, couldn't be bothered to
explain or (frightening, even for a five-year-old) actually thought
that blind faith was sufficient discussion and answer. Moreover,
for a long time I was instantly suspicious when adults incorporated
the word ``just'' into a sentence (like when the dentist said
``This will hurt just a bit'', or when everybody was in the car
waiting to go to PD for a picnic and Aunty Teh would say ``I'll be
just a minute.'').
	   Of course, it's not always easy to answer the Why-question on
the spur of the moment, even to the satisfaction of a
five-year-old. Moreover, the obvious answer is not always the most
satisfying one. For instance, I'll never forget my disappointment
at learning the (adult's) truth about rainbows - and I still
believe that the Creator didn't design everything to happen as a
mere consequence of something else. Every so often, you see a
stroke of pure genius - and life has thrown you another curve ball.
	   So perhaps it's not so much a question of either looking for or
finding nice, neat answers. Maybe it's more a matter of asking the
right questions and understanding why one asked them in the first
place.
	   Debating is actually more about that process than providing
fully functional solutions to problems. It's about the process of
understanding the questions enough to allow the consideration of
many, often opposing, answers and weighing the respective merits of
each. This is where strategy begins.
	   I said last week that we'd look at training for the preparation
phase of a debate, so we'll begin there. There are five basic
building blocks to a debate. These are: case structure, issues that
put muscle on the structure, argumentation that strengthens each
issue, examples that demonstrate how and why it will all work
together, and (if you are really smart!) contingency plans in case
something goes wrong or the opposition can do more damage to the
integrity of your case.
	   Case structure is the most fundamental of these things. It
involves the approach to the debate that the team must take,
something which is usually conditioned by the motion and the side
(government or opposition) that you find yourself on. Practise
taking different approaches to the same issue in ``discussion
groups'' during debate practices. Get somewhere between four and
eight trainees around a table, give them a motion, and then look at
the issue from as many different angles as possible. Case structure
is also about the ``theme'' your case will centre upon. This begins
to involve the issues that you want to involve in the debate and
the order in which you want to deal with them. Usually, you should
prioritise your issues and deal with the most important one first.
Which is the most important will depend entirely on the approach
you have decided.
	   For example, let's say that the motion is ``That Government
support for the arts is wasted money'' and that the approach that
you have decided to take (as the government side) is to demonstrate
that the money is badly spent because so few people benefit from
it, for instance, a few artists and society's elite. OK. So the
issue which becomes critical is being able to prove a) that the
major portion of society does not go to art galleries or theatres
and does not benefit from government support for the arts in any
other (indirect) way, and b) that the support that is given is
concentrated in only a few, possibly undeserving hands. Remember
that merely proving that the money might be better spent elsewhere
does not necessarily prove that it is not being well spent on the
arts.
	   Similarly, with a motion of this type, it is also possible to
take on a number of other approaches. For example, you might try to
argue that the money is wasted because the arts themselves become
dependent on subsidy and less effective and competitive as a
result. Or, you might want to take the position that the money is
unfairly distributed and only profits the modern arts at the
expense of traditional arts and crafts. Each of these is an
approach or theme - not different points that you should try to
work into one case.
	   The issues that you use to ``flesh'' this case structure out
with are the battle ``forces'' that you apportion to each of the
team members. In this aspect also, do not take on too much. It is
much more efficient for a second speaker to ``extend'' the
arguments of the first speaker in a logical manner - and one which
involves his or her own points - rather than just ``chucking in'' a
whole new line of argumentation with little linkage and only
marginal relevance.
	   Next week, we're going to round off this first series on
debating with a look at strategy and some more training tips. In
the meantime, keep looking for life's curve balls.

Family tries to raise ransom for Lithuanian's release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Since businessman Viktor Grodis was
taken hostage in Chechnya nine months ago, his plight has been
frequent front-page news _ but the attention hasn't helped his wife
raise much money for his ransom.
	   Grodis' captors want dlrs 100,000 and say they'll cut off his
head and send it to his wife if they aren't paid. That amount is
the equivalent of about 36 years of wages for the average
Lithuanian.
	   ``I would not have that much money even if I sold my house, my
land and borrowed as much as possible,'' Grodis' wife, Veronika
Grodiene, said in a recent interview. ``But I still have hopes of
seeing him alive.''
	   Her hopes hinge on contributions for the ransom _ but she says
she's raised only about dlrs 2,500 so far.
	   The Grodis family has approached private donors and has even
toyed with the idea of a special national lottery to collect the
ransom money.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius has appealed to
Chechen leaders from action to free the hostage, but he has
steadfastly refused to dip into the national treasury for ransom
money.
	   ``We can not give funds to pay ransom for Lithuanian citizen,''
Vagnorius told The Associated Press. ``This is considered an
encouragement of terrorism, it violates international agreements
and doesn't give any guarantee that the hostage will go free.''
	   Grodiene says her husband was in the import-export business, but
declined to give specifics.

A SPECIAL adviser to the Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa yesterday

<TEXT>
called for a restructuring of the economy with emphasis on the
development of the high-tech and value-added industry.
	   Paul Yip Kwok-wah, an adviser on Taiwan affairs, said the local
economy had been too dependent on the property and services
sectors.
	   ``The current economy is gloomy and it is very important for us
to develop more means to earn our living,'' Mr Yip said.
	   ``The economic crisis has reflected the inadequacies of our
economic structure, which had been relying too much on the property
market and services industry,'' he said.
	   Mr Yip cited Taiwan as an example of where the high-tech and
value-added industry was doing well and remained stable amid the
Asian financial crisis.
	   ``We have to consider all the short, medium and long-term
development. All the fundamentals have to be taken into account for
sustainable growth,'' he said.
	   But Mr Yip said the automatic adjustment provided a good
opportunity for businesses to reduce their operating costs and
enhance their competitiveness.
	   He said this would help Hong Kong remain a base for companies
expanding their mainland businesses.
	   Mr Yip said he believed the situation would force the government
into developing a better economic structure at a faster rate and
with more funding for technology research.
	   Asked whether he had discussed the issue with Mr Tung, Mr Yip
said: ``The bureau heads are formulating methods to solve the
problems''.
	   Asked whether there would be a problem of security as Hong Kong
recently relaxed its entry restrictions for Taiwanese visitors,
considering that some Taiwanese businessmen had been caught
allegedly spying on the mainland, Mr Yip did not give a direct
response.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to fly to Delhi and

<TEXT>
Islamabad middle of this month with an important mission of
defusing tensions in the region following the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan.
	   Dhaka is negotiating with New Delhi and Islamabad the schedule
of the visits, as desired by the Prime Minister, officials said.
	   Hasina in her latest letters to Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
expressed her will to undertake trips to the two SAARC countries at
the earliest convenience.
	   The two letters were handed over to the High Commissioners of
the two countries on Monday.
	   ``The Prime Minister is likely to make the tours in mid June,
although exact dates are yet to be finalised,'' a source indicated
yesterday.
	   It is expected to be a two-day shuttle, one day for each
capital, the source said.
	   The primary objective of the mission of the Prime Minister of
Bangladesh, which has already signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), is to
personally request the heads of government of the two South Asian
nations to refrain from escalating the tensions further.

Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi emerged from Tuesday

<TEXT>
night's meeting with the Thailand Development Research Institute
(TDRI) to announce an economic policy to help stimulate the export
and manufacturing sectors. It was a welcome change.
	   ''Since day one,'' he said, ''our priority has been to solve the
monetary and financial problems, and we have achieved considerable
results ... Our focus has been external factors, but TDRI suggests
that from now on it's time to seriously stimulate the manufacturing
and export sectors, involving both industry and agriculture.'' It
was imperative that Tuesday's meeting mark the beginning of the
Chuan administration's consolidation of comprehensive
economic-crisis management, as it is quite clear that the
government's efforts thus far have been heavily concentrated on
currency stability, the banking crisis and controlling inflation.
	   There is indeed a lot of work to be done. Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda is clearly too busy, as he immerses himself
in the nitty-gritty of micro-banking and monetary issues, to have
the time to oversee an overall picture of the economy.
	   He also has several other ''big'' financial and monetary tasks
ahead of him, not least is to find, as Martin Wolf of the Financial
Times describes it, ''a swift and efficient way of eliminating the
overhang of private-sector debt [as] there is too little pressure
on foreign lenders to write off foolish loans.'' TDRI chairman
Anand Panyarachun has quite rightly recommended that the government
adopt a comprehensive management in dealing with the crisis. Since
this government took power, a vacuum has persisted, and the cost of
this will be even dearer if it is not filled soon as the external
situation deteriorates. Indeed Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai can no
longer afford to leave such a vacuum unattended. The government's
image for not exerting enough efforts to help the poor has already
taken its toll. Chuan is due to announce a comprehensive social
policy next week, a very welcome move.
	   But the premier must decide to whomj he should give the
authority to oversee the entire macro-economic management.
Officially the responsibility rests with Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai, but the latter has clearly been too busy at the Commerce
Ministry, which often requires him to travel abroad to woo foreign
investment and promote Thai exports.
	   Chuan could find a replacement for Supachai at the Commerce
Ministry and make him the full-time economic minister in charge of
the comprehensive macro-economic programme. Alternatively Tarrin
could do the job himself if a new finance minister could be found
to replace him, but with the financial crisis far from over he is
still desperately needed at the Finance Ministry.
	   Either Supachai or Tarrin would be ideal to head a national
macro-economic committee that included outside members, much like
the previous economic-stabilisation policy committee during the
Prem government in the 1970s and '80s. TDRI's senior members could
be seconded to give their input, since the think-tank is the only
organisation to have worked on comprehensive economic- and
social-programme proposals for the government.
	   If made chairman, Supachai would need to get himself organised,
because his role so far has been at best fragmented. Speed is
vital, and to solve the economic problems he needs an effective
team to consolidate the various economic measures and follow up
closely on their implementation by state agencies.
	   The sticking point here is the personal differences between
Supachai and Tarrin. Tarrin needs to be able to accept Supachai's
authority. It is a personal sacrifice which the country demands of
him, or rather of both men. There is no other choice: both of them
need each other, perhaps more than they are willing to admit.
	   This national committee can enlist an efficient and
well-organised secretariat to screen proposals and measures
submitted by the Finance Ministry so as to avoid unnecessary
disputes. The economy needs to be stimulated, despite what the
International Monetary Fund may say, but to get that going
effectively Chuan must reorganise his economic-management team. If
he does not, his government and the country will fail.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government has awarded a contract to
build a 270-kilometer (170-mile) pipeline from Jordan to north
Egypt to the U.S. company AMOCO.
	   Marwan Dudin, head of the regional authority in Aqaba, where the
dlrs 400 million pipeline will start, said Thursday that a
memorandum of understanding has been signed with AMOCO.
	   The pipeline will carry natural gas from the fields in the Nile
Delta across the Sinai and under the Red Sea to Aqaba.
	   Dudin said the gas will be used to generate electricity,
replacing the diesel and fuel oil currently consumed by Jordan's
power stations. The substitution will ultimately reduce the
country's oil consumption.
	   AMOCO's vice president, Bruce Ericson, said that in a second
project, the pipeline will continue 350 kilometers (220 miles) from
Aqaba to Amman and neighboring cities.
	   The contract for the second phase has not yet been awarded.
	   Ericson said the pipeline will transport 200 million cubic feet
(6 million cubic meters) of natural gas a day, starting in 2001.
The flow will gradually increase to 300 million cubic feet (9
million cubic meters) by 2006.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Bahrain Telecommunications Co. has
awarded two contracts worth a total of 9.2 million dinars (dlrs 24
million) to Sweden's Ericsson to expand and upgrade its network,
the Bahrain Tribune said Thursday.
	   Ericsson Radio AB won a contract for 7.4 million dinars (dlrs 20
million) to expand the company's global standard mobile system from
its current capacity of 80,000 lines to 150,000, the newspaper
said.
	   The expansion will be implemented in three phases and should be
completed in October 1999, the newspaper said.
	   The other contract was awarded to Ericsson Telecoms to install
transit switches in two areas that handle traffic between the
various mobile exchanges. The project will be completed by November
1999, the Tribune added.
	   The company, better known as Batelco, has said it plans to
invest some 30 million dinars (dlrs 79 million) this year on
expansion.
	   Batelco, which runs a monopoly on the island, is 20 percent
owned by Britain's Cable  Wireless and 36 percent by the Bahraini
government. The remaining shares are listed on the Bahrain Stock
Exchange.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government is studying proposals from
Russian and British-Dutch firms to exploit oil shale deposits in
southern Jordan, the ministry of energy said Thursday.
	   A ministry official said a Russian firm plans to extract 350,000
tons of oil a year by using a new distillation technique to extract
oil from shale at ``costs lower than the current market cost.''
	   The British-Dutch Shell Co., however, plans an initial
production capacity of 5,110 tons (5,621 short tons) a day. This
will rise to 511,000 a day on completion of another oil shale
plant.
	   He said the Jordanian government has sent oil shale samples to
several countries in order to find a cost-effective extraction.
	   The oil shale deposits lie in the desert between the Dead Sea
and the Red Sea port of Aqaba. They are estimated at 40 billion
tons, of which energy officials say 10 percent is oil.
	   Jordan has no known oil reserves. It imports its daily
requirement of 85,000 barrels of oil and fuel oil from Iraq.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped on the Jordanian stock
exchange this week, but turnover increased slightly, a market
report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the decline to a fall in share prices blamed
on a shortage of cash and the stalemate in the Middle East peace
talks.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 2.99 percent to 174.90 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks slipped by 3.78 percent, industrial
firms by 1.82 percent, the services sector by 0.49 percent. But
shares of insurance companies increased by 0.79 percent.
	   Turnover also increased by 28.6 percent to 6.3 million dinars
(dlrs 8.8 million), the report said.
	   It said shares of 89 firms were traded.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
continued to slip this week, closing at 2,184.8 points, down 28.6
points, or 1.26 percent from last week, The National Industries Co.
said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said it seemed the market will
not pick up until the government implements measures intended to
stimulate trade.
	   Officials have been talking about such steps, including opening
the exchange to non-nationals, but nothing has materialized.
	   Some 248.67 million shares were traded this week, 3.11 percent
lower than last week's 256.66 million. The value of these shares
rose 8.19 percent to 72.79 million dinars (dlrs 237.87 million).
Last week, it was 67.28 million dinars (dlrs 219.86 million).
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, five closed higher,
35 closed lower, and the shares of 34 companies were unchanged. The
rest were not traded.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The chairman of Merril Lynch
International toured the war-wrecked downtown of Beirut Thursday
and met Lebanon's prime minister.
	   ``I am very impressed with what is happening here in Lebanon ...
We see positive opportunities for our work,'' Winthrop Smith told
reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, himself
a billionaire tycoon and architect of the country's reconstruction
from the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Smith also visited Solidere, the biggest company in charge of
rebuilding downtown Beirut. He described the city's future as
``positive.''
	   Merril Lynch International, a Wall Street investment firm, has
been operating in Lebanon for 35 years. It was the lead manager of
a dlrs 100 million Eurobond issue last year to help Lebanon finance
the rebuilding of its electricity network.
	   The company is also expected to supervise a planned dlrs 1
billion Eurobond issue to finance development projects in Lebanon.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Italian news agency ANSA has moved
its Middle East regional bureau to Beirut, 12 years after fleeing a
city plunged in the chaos of war.
	   ``ANSA is back because we have trust in Lebanon,'' ANSA's Middle
East bureau chief, Furio Morroni, told a news conference Wednesday
night.
	   ANSA, like other news agencies and foreign companies, moved
regional offices from Beirut as the Lebanese capital became a haven
for kidnappers and rival gunmen who fought over territory during
the 1975-90 conflict.
	   Many companies have returned to Beirut since the civil war,
encouraged by its multibillion dollar reconstruction program and by
the government's newfound authority.
	   ANSA, which moved its regional offices to Nicosia, Cyprus, in
1986, maintained an office in Beirut during the war but without
Italian staff.

Jospin lifts defense secrecy on Elysee wiretap case
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with newspaper report confirmed by prime minister's
office; ADDS byline  
  By DENIS BOULARD  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has waived defense
secrecy restrictions on a probe of wiretapping practices under the
late President Francois Mitterrand, Jospin's office said Thursday.
	   In a letter to the investigating judge, made public by the prime
minister's office, Jospin said that he noted that ``today no reason
appears to demand the maintenance of defense secrecy ....''
	   The office of the Socialist prime minister made the information
public after the respected daily Le Monde came out with the news in
its Friday edition.
	   The wiretapping case has raised questions about the power of the
presidency, after investigators reportedly found Mitterrand and his
aides ordered the surveillance of 46 people, including journalists
and entertainers.
	   In the letter written Wednesday to investigative Judge Jean-Paul
Valat, Jospin said he decided to lift defense secrecy on the case
involving surveillance between Jan 1, 1983 and March 20, 1986.
	   But the lifting is partial. In his letter, Jospin said that,
regarding any questioning of the office in charge of wiretaps, the
Interministerial Control Group, only the general in charge,
Pierre-Eugene Charroy, may take questions from the judge.
	   Valat had complained that Jospin had not responded to his
request since the Socialist prime minister came to power in June
last year. Jospin had supported lifting defense secrecy but was
attacked by some Mitterrand faithful in the party who defended the
president's actions.

WHEN I visited a dim sum factory in Hong Kong several years ago,

<TEXT>
I asked the managing director what was the main ingredient that
made his steam dumplings a savoury hit all over the world.
	   The man owed it to good recipes and more importantly the
company's sound knowledge of its customers and their preferences.
	   ``Different nationalities have different cravings. We tailor our
products to suit their fancy. Americans, Canadians and most
Europeans and the Japanese like less spicy dim sum while most
Asians prefer more flavour in their food,'' he said.
	   Madeleine Bakery Cafe, a Malaysian company, could well be
subscribing to this formula. It seems to have a better
understanding of customers' needs.
	   How else could one explain its excellent performance over the
last few years, especially the past five months. Despite the
economic downturn, all six Madeleine outlets have recorded their
best profits! Upon comparing Madeleine's products to similar food
items offered by other popular French and Japanese delis in Kuala
Lumpur, several friends and I found Madeleine's a lot tastier.
	   At Madeleine's, you can get a variety of pies and puffs -
chicken, beef, seafood - shepherd's pie, fruit tarts and an
assortment of sweet and savoury buns, bread, cakes, doughnuts and
other pastries.
	   The outlets also have burgers and sausages, tuna, egg and
chicken sandwiches and delicious fillings to go with their
freshly-baked croissants.
	   Besides these, they offer roast chicken portions, salads, onion,
chicken, mushroom and other soups of the day, quiche, spaghetti,
lasagne and many other items available at the regular delis.
	   ``Our bestselling items are the pies, the croissants and our
fruit tarts,'' said Safian Husin, assistant operations manager at
the Bangsar outlet.
	   Another pull factor for Madeleine is the pricing. Things are
cheaper there ... even after it recently increased prices. For
example, one deli retails its tuna-filled croissant at RM5.30 while
Madeleine retails it at RM4.80.
	   The latter's roast chicken croissant is also much tastier at
RM4.80 compared to its competitor's which sells the same thing for
RM6.50! Even Madeleine's fruit tarts are a few sen cheaper.
	   For continued consistency in taste and shape of food products,
quality control is ensured at the Kepong factory which is manned by
over 50 staff.
	   Madeleine Bakery Cafe, which first opened four outlets at one go
in February 1994, is now at Penang Plaza, Penang; Bangsar Shopping
Centre, Kuala Lumpur; PKNS Complex, Shah Alam; Subang Airport, and
Wisma Thrifty and Amcorp Mall at Petaling Jaya.
	   Plans are under way to expand to Summit City, Subang Jaya; Kuala
Lumpur City Centre; Sungai Wang Plaza and Lot 10, Kuala Lumpur, and
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Also in the pipeline are
franchising plans.
	   This weekly column is devoted to made-in-Malaysia products,
concepts and services.

The poor, unlike the markets, do not have the power to impose

<TEXT>
their will, writes Chang Noi.
	   The mini-crisis over the financial decrees was a very revealing
episode. At one level, it was no more than a three-day delay in
getting approval for some technical cleaning-up operations. But the
emotions, fears and ambitions which tumbled out over these three
days revealed much larger forces behind.
	   On one side, the Democrat leaders, the business associations,
and much of the urban press hit the panic button. Their cry was
very clear: if we don't pass these decrees, the markets will
abandon us. Political instability will make us look a bit more like
Indonesia. International capital will flee. The IMF will hold back
the next instalment. Disaster.
	   On the other side was the discourse of the poor. The government
is on the side of the rich. Farmers have crippling debts too and
how come they are not getting bailed out. Why should everybody have
to pay for the national debts when the financial crooks who caused
them get off scot free.
	   On the one side, the markets. On the other, the poor. Rarely is
this division revealed so clearly. But this is the key axis of the
age of globalisation.
	   All the evidence from around the world shows that market
liberalisation and the spread of international capital widens the
gap between rich and poor. This proposition is no longer
controversial or radical in any way. The World Bank's own 1997
development report was devoted to just this issue. International
bodies like the Asian Development Bank and the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development have reached the same
conclusion. They support liberalisation and globalisation. But they
admit that the results are divisive. And they don't know what to do
about it.
	   The mini-crisis showed that day-to-day politics is more and more
patterned by this division. The Democrat-led government has set out
to be a dutiful pupil of the markets. By the logic of open
politics, the opposition falls into the role of defender of the
poor.
	   After the mini-crisis passed, the prime minister blasted the
opposition for ''creating social divisions''. But this accusation
was inaccurate. The social division already exists. The gap between
rich and poor is large and getting larger. Chavalit and the
opposition did not create this division. Rather, they are
increasingly being driven by its political logic.
	   The markets argue: if you go against us, then things will be
worse for you. Capital will flow out and everyone will be worse
off. The markets, of course, are right. They have the power to make
their threats come true. The Democrat-led government and the
business lobby fall in with this argument. Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda has argued consistently that we have no choice but
to do as the markets demand.
	   But the poor understand the divisive tendency in the age of
globalisation. They understand it instinctively when they see the
government's economic team fronted by two ex-bankers and a rich
tycoon. Their leaders have studied the international experience.
The poor know that they must defend themselves, because nobody else
will. But they don't have the power of the markets to impose their
will. They must leverage any advantage presented by circumstances
and crises. They must get what they can from the political
ambitions of the likes of Chavalit.
	   For the poor, the decrees were not the real issue. The
technicalities of managing the financial crisis are remote from
their lives. Punishing some of the financial crooks is a bit more
important to them. It won't make the poor less poor by a single
satang. But it will mark a small but significant shift away from a
world in which the rich can get away with anything, at the expense
of everybody else.
	   But in the short term, the fortunes of the poor are dictated by
things like land, water, crop prices and debt. During the
mini-crisis, farmers rallied in Khon Kaen to demand a debt
moratorium, and Assembly of the Poor leaders sat down with
officials to negotiate concessions on land rights. It worked.
Suddenly this government is talking about prosecuting financial
crooks, considering a moratorium on agricultural debt, and
accelerating the grant of land rights.
	   Many seemed horrified by the opposition's role in the
mini-crisis. They argue (quite rightly) that the debt was largely
created by the Financial Institution Development Fund profligacy
during the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government, and was already dumped
onto the people by that government's decrees of August 1997. They
question (quite rightly) what credentials this rich and devious
politician has to claim leadership of the poor. They fear (probably
again quite rightly) that the return of Chavalit would make things
worse for everybody, rich and poor alike.
	   But these arguments miss the point. The face-off between the
markets and the poor is a fact of life in the age of globalisation.
No amount of urban middle-class horror about the prospects of
Chavalit's return will make it go away. If you embrace
globalisation, then you must accept its consequences. These include
the widening rich-poor gap, and the impact of this gap on politics.
	   A new group of centrists fear that ahead of this face-off lies a
slippery slope down to political polarisation. They fear the
division will become more strained, more ideological, more violent.
Their fear is framed by the memory of 1975-6.
	   For both Anand Panyarachun and Thirayuth Boonmee, the memory is
very personal. Thirayuth was a moderate student leader swept away
by the radicalisation of his colleagues. Anand was a liberal
bureaucrat cast as a communist during the establishment's lurch to
the right. For several weeks, Anand has been urging the Democrats
to adopt more even-handed policies. Thirayuth's statement which
sparked the crisis was couched in the same vein.
	   Out of the mini-crisis, the markets have got the decrees and a
confirmation of the government's dutiful stand. The poor have made
some slight gains too. But whether the mini-crisis marks a move
forward or backward along the route of polarisation now depends on
Chuan Leekpai and his understanding of what the centrists are
telling him.
	   Chuan must be -- and be seen to be -- leader of a nation in
crisis not just bankers in crisis.

ECONOMISTS have backed Hong Kong's high ranking in a survey of

<TEXT>
global competitiveness despite the recession.
	   In its annual study of economic competitiveness, the
Geneva-based World Economic Forum put Hong Kong second, behind
Singapore.
	   The two economies were in the same positions last year. The
United States ranked third, while Britain came in at No 4, up from
seven in 1997.
	   One of the authors of the report, Andrew Warner said current and
long-term growth prospects were key elements in assessing
competitiveness.
	   Singapore and Hong Kong held their rankings because their growth
potential had not been harmed by the regional financial crisis.
	   Ian Perkin, economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, said the SAR was still competitive because of its role as
an entrepot for the mainland.
	   ``You can't divorce Hong Kong from the mainland, even though
we're in recession. Hong Kong will be competitive if the mainland
remains competitive.'' A devaluation of the yuan would make the SAR
more competitive, he added.
	   Mr Perkin said both Hong Kong and Singapore were seen as forces
of stability in the region.
	   The managing director of investment firm Towry Law Asia, Bill
Tatham, said despite the economic downturn, Hong Kong remained
extremely competitive.
	   He said Hong Kong's high productivity, strong work ethic,
infrastructure, and the speed of transactions made it more
efficient for doing business than other major economies such as
Britain.
	   ``I'm surprised we're not No 1, it's probably because asset
prices in Singapore are cheaper than Hong Kong,'' he said.
	   Leung Wai-kin, associate professor of business at the University
of Hong Kong, said that while such rankings were subjective, Hong
Kong was competitive because the recession was only likely to last
for a few quarters.
	   He said import and export figures for the first quarter this
year showed modest growth, and Hong Kong remained an efficient
service centre despite the dip in consumer confidence.
	   ``The fundamentals have not changed but sentiment has changed.
Investors and the public are pessimistic, leading to a fall in
consumption,'' Mr Leung said.
	   Dr Francis Lui Ting-ming, director of the centre for economic
development at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
said the current economic problems would not affect the SAR's
ability to compete internationally. ``Hong Kong is competitive but
it doesn't mean there should not be adjustments.'' He said high
interest rates had not decreased competitiveness, although they
were a major reason for the recession.
	   But sales director at ING Barings Securities, James Osborn, said
the SAR's high rating was not justified.
	   ``The corporate growth rate has slowed, the economy is going
into recession. There are a lot of problems,'' he said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the people of Chittagong

<TEXT>
Hill Tracts (CHT) to maintain peace at all costs and work together
for development of the region.
	   Addressing a big public meeting here today, Sheikh Hasina also
criticised the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, Begum
Khaleda Zia, for announcing a programme of long march against the
peace process in the CHT.
	   Sheikh Hasina said that only the arms smugglers and drug dealers
can oppose the CHT peace agreement and the laws that posed a threat
to their interests.
	   She said it is beyond her realisation as to why long march has
been called against CHT accord and laws that ``can only anger arms
smugglers and drug traffickers.''
	   She said ``a quarter'' was out to disturb peace, stability and
communal harmony in the hill tracts by resorting to a militant
action programme.
	   The Prime Minister said that after signing the historic CHT
peace accord , the government had undertaken many programmes for
overall development of the hill region.
	   The development projects taken up after the signing of the peace
accord for the hill districts involve Tk 2175.83 crore, she
mentioned.
	   Of the total allocation Tk 646.17 crore is being spent for the
department of that Bandarban hill district.
	   Hasina said no real development took place in Chittagong Hill
Tracts in last two decades. ``Present government is working after
identifying socio-economic problems in the region.''
	   Listing a number of projects taken up for the hill districts,
she said these are development of human resources, communication,
agro-based industrial and water resources, rubber plantation,
preservation of forests and elimination illiteracy.
	   The darkness of the region has been removed with the signing of
the CHT agreement. Now the government will take special steps to
develop the region as a tourist centre. The hilly region, including
Bandarban, will be developed as special tourist zones she added.
	   The government has given special attention to the expansion of
education in the region, she said reiterating that one science and
technology university will be established in the CHT region.
	   The Prime Minister said schools will be established in the
remotest areas of the region and special programmes will be taken
up for reaching healthcare facilities and improving communication
system.
	   Organised by the local Awami League, the public meeting was also
addressed by AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, Forest and
Environment Minister Syeda Sajada Chowdhury, Food and Agriculture
Minister Begum Matia Chowdhury and local MP Bir Bahadur.
	   Minister Kalparanjan Chakma, Chairman of task force on CHT
refugees Dipankar Talukder MP, chairmen of three hill district
councils Khoaing Cha Pru Master, Ching Qui Roaja and Samiran Dewan,
Chittagong city mayor Alhaj AMB Mohiuddin Chowdhury and commerce
and industrial affairs secretary of the ruling party Akhteruzzaman
Babu were present on the occasion.
	   Earlier, addressing the development coordination meeting at the
local circuit house, the Prime Minister asked the officials to
identify the problems of the region for taking proper and specific
steps.
	   ``Take up specific projects to allow investment from the
donors,'' she said adding the CHT region cannot remain
underdeveloped if local officials do their duty properly.
	   She reminded the officials that government's money is the public
money and said they should try to render their best possible
services to the people.
	   About the need for doctors in local hospitals and teachers in
educational institutions, she suggested recruitment of local
doctors and educated people for ensuring their stay in the region.

THE Royal Forestry Department Wednesday ordered a thorough

<TEXT>
investigation of 24 senior officials it believes are guilty of
serious misconduct over their alleged involvement in the Salween
logging scandal.
	   Two of the officials have been named as former department chief
Sathit Sawinthorn and his deputy Prawat Thanatkha.
	   Both men, now holding inactive posts following their transfers
shortly after the scandal emerged early this year, as well as
Thaworn Lamsrijan, chief of the department's Natural Resources
Conservation Office, will be investigated separately from the 21
others because of their high ranks.
	   Of the group of 21, four C-8-level officials have also been
transferred to positions where they are not involved in forestry
supervision. Ranks of the remaining 17 officials range from C-4 to
C-7.
	   Speaking after being informed of Wednesday's order, Prawat said
he would take legal action against a working committee assigned to
carry out the investigation if it produced false evidence against
him.

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ A South African soldier and
his brother, both wearing ski masks, appeared in court Thursday in
connection with recent thefts of military weapons and ammunition.
	   Police warned journalists their cameras would be confiscated if
they attempted to film or photograph the suspects, who allegedly
have right-wing connections.
	   Their identities were later released as Sgt. Hendrik du Preez,
34, of 44 Parachute Brigade, and his brother Petrus, 32, a farm
foreman. Reports initally had said both suspects were soldiers.
	   Police spokeswoman Johlene van der Merwe said the men were
arrested on Wednesday on charges of murder, armed robbery,
housebreaking and theft. Judicial proceedings in their case were
postponed to June 11. The suspects were denied bail.
	   They are suspected of being involved in the theft Monday of
200,000 rounds of ammunition while it was being transported in a
truck from the Tempe Military Base near this central city. The body
of one of the drivers was later found, and the other is still
missing.
	   The suspects were also believed to have been involved in the
theft last month of 117 weapons, including mortars and rocket
launchers, from the 44 Parachute Brigade at the same base. Most of
the weapons have been recovered, authorities said.
	   There was no immediate indication whether the thefts were linked
to any plans to destabilize the country ahead of next year's
national elections.
	   Under South African law, no image, photograph or sketch may be
published of any arrested person until criminal proceedings are
completed. unless the national police commissioner allows it.

Indonesian military helicopter crashes, killing all 12 aboard

  Eds: UPDATES throughout with one guerrilla group claiming
responsibility for shoot-down, other denying, military denial

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military helicopter plunged into a
cloud-covered mountain Thursday in the disputed territory of East
Timor, killing two top commanders and the 10 other officers and
soldiers aboard.
	   East Timorese separatists opposed to the Indonesian government
claimed in Lisbon, Portugal, that guerrillas had attacked the
helicopter, but the Indonesian military and another guerrilla group
denied that.
	   There were no survivors. The U.S.-made Bell 205 helicopter
exploded on impact, military Lt. Col. Supardi said in a telephone
interview from Dili, capital of the former Portuguese colony.
	   It was raining at the time, and visibility was poor.
	   ``It was a pure accident,'' Supardi said.
	   The victims included Maj. Gen. Yudomo, who was appointed last
month as military commander for eastern Indonesia, including East
Timor, and Col. Slamet Sidabutar, commander in the territory.
	   Yudomo, who was based in the resort island of Bali, and the
other officers were on an inspection tour when the helicopter
crashed.
	   Army Capt. Muhamad, the military spokesman in Dili, suffered
serious injuries and was rushed to a hospital but he died while
being treated. The helicopter shattered into pieces on impact,
leaving only the tail intact.
	   Hampered by rugged terrain, rescue workers evacuated burned
bodies from the remote site near Viqueque, about 110 miles (180
kilometers) east of Dili. The helicopter went down four minutes
after taking off from the nearby town of Baucau.
	   The city is 1,200 miles (1,920 kilometers) east of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   Rebels in the territory have been fighting the military for two
decades. In Lisbon, Azancot de Menezes of the East Timor Socialist
Association said that East Timor Armed Liberation Forces rebels
attacked the helicopter as it prepared for take-off.
	   But the deputy chief of the East Timor military, Col. Johanes
Suryo Prabowo, ruled that out.
	   ``It is impossible. The crash site is so close to an army
regiment visited by the commander and entourage'' that rebels have
no chance of getting close to the area, Suryo said.
	   Other rebels also denied the helicopter had been shot down.
Adalberto Alves, spokesman in Lisbon for FRETILIN _ the Movement
for the Independence of East Timor _ said that it was nothing but
an accident.
	   The Indonesian military invaded East Timor in 1975, and has
maintained a heavy presence there ever since. Indonesia declared
the territory its 27th province in 1976, but a small band of
guerrillas who want independence continue to fight.
	   In the Indonesian military's worst air crash, an air force C-130
transport plane crashed minutes after taking off from Halim
military base in Jakarta in October 1991, killing 136 soldiers
aboard. One man survived. The cause remains unknown.
	   In March last year, an Indonesian air force F-16 jet crashed in
bad weather in Jakarta, killing the pilot.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Despite preparations for the birth of his

<TEXT>
second child, Tan Boon Heng was caught by surprise when his son was
born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
	   When wife Kee May Sang, 28, delivered at 4.07am on Saturday at
Ampang Puteri Specialist Hospital, everything went smoothly and
seemed normal.
	   However, just hours later, they were told their son was having
breathing difficulties as the membrane separating the chest cavity
from the abdominal cavity had failed to close properly.
	   (This rare condition results in a diaphragmatic hernia when the
baby's abdominal organs enters the chest cavity and pushes against
the heart and lungs causing acute respiratory distress.) The
paediatrician informed Tan that the baby needed immediate surgery
as his condition was life threatening. The surgery would cost about
RM15,000.
	   When the New Straits Times was informed of Tan's plight on
Sunday, the two-day-old baby weighing 2.98 kilogrammes had already
been wheeled into the operation theatre.
	   The surgery was successful but Tan, who earns RM1,200 as a
self-employed marketing representative, needs help.
	   Although he had saved enough money for the baby's delivery, Tan
said he could not afford to pay for the operation and had to appeal
to the public for donations.
	   Those wishing to donate can send their crossed cheques, money or
postal order payable to The New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd with
``baby of Kee May Sang'' written behind.
	   All contributions should be sent to The Donations Department,
New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd at 31, Jalan Riong, 59100 Kuala
Lumpur.

LOCAL workers will have first crack at the 100,000 new jobs to

<TEXT>
be created under the government's emergency employment program,
Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has pledged.
	   And the government will closely monitor the program to see that
locals have priority over imported labour, Sir Donald was quoted as
saying by The Frontier convener Emily Lau Wai-hing, a newly-elected
legislator.
	   Unionist Leung Yiu-chung said the best way to ensure employment
priority for locals was for the government to hire them directly.
	   The usual practice of contracting out government projects should
be changed, he said.
	   ``Contracting out tends to create chances for middlemen using
imported labour,'' Mr Leung said.
	   ``If the government is the boss, it can prevent this
happening.'' But Secretary for Manpower and Education Joseph Wong
Wing-ping would not rule out the possibility of importing labour in
future.
	   ``Contractors should continue to employ local workers first by
open recruitment and imported labour should only be allowed to ease
bottleneck demand for workers,'' Mr Wong said after the first
meeting of the Taskforce on Employment yesterday.
	   He said the government would closely monitor the situation
before deciding whether to resume the importation of foreign labour
to speed up public works projects.
	   Union chiefs have expressed concern that some of the 100,000
jobs might go to foreign workers.
	   ``We are very concerned with how to guarantee that local workers
could be able to get these jobs first and the government should
have measures to ensure it,'' said Cheng Yiu-tong, chairman of the
Federation of Trade Unions and a member of the jobs taskforce.
	   Ms Lau said the Financial Secretary told representatives from
political parties that there would be special courses for local
workers to train them for jobs.

PRACHAKORN Thai Party leader Samak Sundaravej may have the last

<TEXT>
laugh as the 12-member Cobra faction launches a legal battle to
save it from being expelled from the party, constitutional pundits
said.Key coalition members Wednesday insisted the outcome between
opposition partner Samak and the Cobra members who sided with the
Democrat coalition, would not affect the government's stability.
	   As the curtain raiser to a fight for political survival, the
Cobra faction is Thursday scheduled to file a petition with the
political parties registrar, requesting the nullification of the
minutes of the party meeting on Monday.
	   After months of bickering with the party's rebels, Samak finally
engineered his revenge by successfully moving for a motion to
remove 17 party executives, consisting of the party rebels and
their supporters, from the party board. The move was seen as a
crucial first step in his bid to later dismiss the Cobra members
from the party altogether. This would cause them to lose their
House seats as well.
	   With the new party board, Samak is assured of majority support
if he expels the Cobra members. However, they seem determined not
to allow him an easy victory.
	   The faction, led by Interior Minister Vatana Asavahame, will
oppose the resolution made by the party on Monday on two points.
The party executive board was convened despite the lack of a
quorum, the petition said, adding that it failed to invite the
expelled board members to present a counter argument.
	   As if anticipating such a move, party director Chaiyasit
Phupiromkwan countered that the party had an attendance list to
prove a quorum was present and that the party provisions did not
specify the requirement of a counter argument in the removal of
executive board members.
	   Should the faction fail to convince the registrar to rule in its
favour, Cobra members said, it plans to take the case all the way
to the Constitution Court.
	   Article 47 of the charter stipulates MPs have the right to ask
for a Constitution Court ruling on whether a party resolution is
inappropriate to democracy or inhibits the conducting of
parliamentary duties. It also mandates the court to restore an MP's
status if the resolution is nullified.
	   Constitutional experts pointed out that although the Cobra
faction may have a case against Samak, it could hardly expect a
favourable ruling.
	   The intent of the new Constitution is to allow them to support
Democrat leader Chuan Leekpai in assuming the premiership, they
said, but has no provision to protect the faction from repeated
violations of the party resolution opposing their joining the
Cabinet and voting to support the coalition.
	   In order to exhaust all legal avenues, the faction has
threatened to file a separate petition with the Civil Court, aimed
at winning a court injunction to keep the House seats during the
lengthy trial.Samak Wednesday lashed out at the Cobra faction's
planned move to file civil charges, saying it would lead to the
''chaotic'' precedent of involving the courts in political affairs.
	   He also denied speculation he was trying to undermine the
government's stability, saying he only wanted to settle the dispute
within his party.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart Wednesday played down any
possible impact on dwindling coalition support if the Cobra members
lose their House seats. He said the government could bring in
additional supporters or retain the existing coalition set-up.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiseth speculated the faction
would remain in the Cabinet, regardless of the legal outcome with
Prachakorn Thai Party.

DESPITE opposition from caddies and State Railways of Thailand
(STR) employees, Deputy Communications Minister Pradit
Pataraprasith Wednesday insisted on going ahead with the plan to
allow the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) to pay Bt555
million for the use of the SRT's golf course behind Chatuchak
weekend market.
Some 100 caddies and workers from the golf course Wednesday

<TEXT>
rallied outside the BMA headquarters and the ministry against the
plan to turn the course into a public park.
	   SRT employees have threatened to demonstrate against the
decision which they say would put the SRT at a disadvantage since
the BMA would pay only Bt555 million for the use of 357 rai of land
without a timespan.
	   But Pradit said the plan must go ahead because the SRT was
struggling financially with huge accumulated debts and needed more
income from the land lease. If the SRT signs a contract with the
BMA, it will get Bt555 million while the golf course generates only
Bt15 million income annually, he said.
	   SRT State Enterprise Employee Association president Somsak
Kosaisuk has claimed that according to an official assessment the
land is worth Bt150,000 per square wah and therefore the plot
should be worth more than Bt20 billion.
	   Pradit replied that during the current economic difficulties, no
single private group was interested in paying Bt20 billion for the
land. He urged the caddies and workers there to accept jobs to be
offered by the BMA which were more stable and had government
welfare benefits.
	   Pradit said the SRT could not lease the land for commercial
purposes because, according to a Cabinet resolution, after
Chatuchak market was built, the land there must be a green area.
	   More than 100 caddies and workers at the golf course gathered
outside the ministry and submitted a letter opposing the decision
to lease the land to the BMA. They also rallied outside city hall.
	   The letter said the decision would affect 428 workers and their
families because they would lose their jobs which earn them between
Bt8,000 and Bt12,000 a month, including tips from golfers.
	   Panya Khamlert, who led the rally, said Chatuchak Park and Queen
Sirikit Park were close to the golf course.
	   The demonstrators claimed that people using the parks were few
and the Queen Sirikit one was being infested with drug addicts. A
new public park would just mean a new area to be taken over by drug
users.

LANGKAWI, Wed. - Langkawi Yacht Club will have its opening

<TEXT>
during the Commmonwealth Games in September.
	   Tunku Abdullah ibni Almmarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, whose company
Nilam Timur has majority stake in the club, said he was trying to
get Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to open it.
	   He said the club would also invite Queen Elizabeth, expected for
the opening of the Commonwealth Games from Sept 11 to 21, to attend
the function.
	   ``Since Langkawi is the venue for shooting events for the Games,
we are planning to coincide our opening during that time,'' he said
today.
	   The RM12 million club building beside the Kuah jetty was
completed more than a year ago.
	   It has been attracting yacht owners, especially from overseas.
	   Nilam Timur, which is under the stable of Melewar Group of
Companies, controlled by Tunku Abdullah holds a 70 per cent stake
in the yacht club while the rest is owned by Langkawi Development
Authority.
	   Tunku Abdullah also said that after some technical problems
pertaining to the land were ironed out, the club would go on a
membership drive from July.

THE major political parties yesterday welcomed the government's

<TEXT>
12-point anti-unemployment package, but pressed for rental
reductions to help revive the economy.
	   But the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions lambasted the
proposed measures as useless to rescue the jobless.
	   Miss Tang Yin-ngo, CTU representative in the government's task
force, said there were no additional jobs provided in the package.
	   ``Most of the job vacancies were only promises made in the
policy speech last October. There was no new spending by the
government that would create jobs,'' she said.
	   The CTU estimates that this year an additional 100,000 people
would join the workforce.
	   ``The jobs promised in the package could not contain this
growth,'' Miss Tang said.
	   Meanwhile, the CTU was worried that the net growth in
government-initiated vacancies would be lower than the 85,000 jobs
targeted by the government as many projects were nearing
completion.
	   In addition, only one-fourth of these 85,000 jobs were permanent
posts with the remaining good only for three to six months.
	   ``The package is merely a game of figures. It just can't address
the problem directly,'' Miss Tang said.
	   The political parties however welcomed the package. But they
stressed the root of the problem _ the sagging economy _ must be
tackled if unemployment was to be controlled.
	   The Democratic Party, Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong, Liberal Party and The Frontier met Financial Secretary
Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen last night.
	   The parties joined forces in petitioning Sir Donald to introduce
measures to lower rents.
	   The Frontier convenor Emily Lau Wai-hing said while welcoming
the 12-point anti-unemployment measures, The Frontier, like other
parties, believed high rents had contributed to high costs in Hong
Kong.
	   ``The government should take the lead by reducing rent in
shopping centres of housing estates.
	   ``Over the long term, this would help bring down high costs. The
economy might be able to revive faster.'' Ms Lau said Sir Donald
hinted that the government would consider the parties' proposal.
	   ``He appears to agree to our proposal,'' Ms Lau said.
	   Other proposals to stimulate the sluggish economy included the
staging of Expo 2001, by the Liberal Party, and lowering of
interest rates, proposed by the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance to
relax credit.
	   Ms Lau said the parties would meet Sir Donald later next week to
discuss the possibility of tax and rate cuts.
	   ``We (the parties) have yet to arrive at a consensus on tax and
rate issues. But in any case, we are united in this battle against
the sagging economy. Confidence must be restored. This is our
common goal,'' Ms Lau said.

The annual meeting of the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) opened in Geneva on Tuesday with a focus on child labour.
The conference opened as a delegation of 150 children carrying

<TEXT>
banners and chanting slogans entered the Assembly Hall at the UN
building, in Geneva, to call for an end to child labour.
	   The children, many of whom have recently been rescued from
exploitation, are ``core marchers'' in the Global March Against
Child Labour, which has crossed 100 countries since it was launched
six months ago.
	   They include Sultana, 13, from Bangladesh, who supports her
ailing parents by working 14 hours a day as an embroiderer, writes
USIA European Correspondent Wendy Lubetkin from Geneva.
	   Two others are-Taimoor, 11, from Pakistan, who began working in
the brick kilns at the age of four, and Anne, 16, who has worked
for eight years selling shopping bags outside a supermarket in
Kenya.
	   The 1998 session of the International Labour Conference will
launch the first discussion of a new international legal instrument
designed to eliminate the worst forms of child labour.
	   The proposed convention would target such practices as heavy
work in mines and quarries, child pornography and prostitution,
bonded and forced labour, and other activities such as work with
dangerous chemicals and machinery. It would be finalised next year.
	   Government, union leaders and employers at the conference are
also engaged in the final debate on the draft of a ground breaking
declaration on fundamental human rights in the workplace, which
could be adopted during the current session.
	   The declaration would solemnly commit the organisation's 174
member states to the fundamental principles in a group of core
labour standards including freedom of association and collective
bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced labour, and the
abolition of child labour.
	   If adopted the declaration would provide ``the basic ground
rules for promoting social justice in the global economy'' and
would boost the credibility of the ILO, said ILO Director-General
Michel Hansenne.
	   The goal would be to ``ensure that social progress proceeds
apace with economic growth, technological development and trade
liberalisation,'' Hansenne said.
	   Speaking later at a press conference, he declined to elaborate
on the current state of negotiations, but said, ``we have a great
hope of succeeding.''

ALTHOUGH the Asian economic crisis has seen air traffic volumes

<TEXT>
fall, there has been no corresponding drop in published airfares,
according to the American Express Asia Pacific Airfare Index,
released Wednesday.
	   In local currency terms, airfares have actually increased
slightly. Business travellers in particular, continue to pay as
much or more than they did 12 months ago, with any substantial
discounting of airfares targeted mainly at the leisure market.
	   When translated into US dollar terms, however, airfares have
dropped significantly because of the large reduction in the value
of some Asia Pacific currencies.
	   In Thailand, for example, airfares have increased around 4 per
cent over last year in the local currency, but in US dollar terms,
they have dropped 44 per cent.
	   The index found that airfares in all classes of travel
originating in Asia Pacific increased by between 1.5 per cent and
2.8 per cent in the 12 months ending 1st quarter 1998. In US dollar
terms, airfares dropped between 12 to 14 per cent.
	   Mike Thompson, head of supplier relations, American Express,
said the research found that airlines were holding fares stable in
the local currencies despite the Asian currency crisis.
	   ''Airlines around the Asia-Pacific region are facing significant
increases in their costs [when measured in local currencies],
because fuel prices and debt are both usually denominated in US
dollars. Instead of passing these increased costs on to their
customers, at this stage, the airlines are absorbing the increases
rather than passing them on in higher local currency fares,''
Thompson said.
	   He said this was probably because of the increased competition
between airlines that has been heightened by the economic crisis.
While it is welcome news for consumers, if airlines continue to
absorb these costs for an extended period of time, it could have a
serious adverse impact on their profitability.
	   Overall, the airfare index found that fares rose throughout the
Asia Pacific region by about 2 per cent in local currency terms
over the past 12 months, with fares over the most recent quarter
remaining flat.
	   When broken up into destinations, Asia-Pacific airfares to
Australia increased by up to 5 per cent over the past 12 months,
while fares to North Asia increased up to 3 per cent. Fares to
Southeast Asia have stayed relatively flat.

In World Cup warm-up, Dutch film museum spotlights 1974 finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ It's 24 years since the Dutch lost
the 1974 World Cup final 2-1 to West Germany, but for many devoted
fans the emotional scars are still fresh.
	   Ahead of this year's finals in France, which begin June 10, the
Netherlands Film Museum is engaging in a kind of celluloid shock
therapy by screening a series of films about Holland's ultimately
ill-fated 1974 campaign.
	   ``You could say it's part of the healing process,'' organizer
Arthur Kleintjens said Thursday.
	   Highlight of the program is a British film called ``Heading for
Glory,'' which charts the Dutch team's performances in 1974 up to
and including the defeat by host West Germany in the July 7 final
in Munich's Olympic Stadium.
	   The series of films, titled ``The Warming Up,'' begins with a
30-minute report on the climactic final, where the Netherlands took
a 1-0 lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty before the Germans had
touched the ball, but ultimately lost 2-1.
	   When it was released shortly after the 1974 finals, ``Heading
for Glory'' bombed in Dutch cinemas. The trauma of winning only
silver medals was just too new for supporters to relive on the
silver screen, said Kleintjens.
	   ``It's a shame because it was good soccer and a good film.''
	   Led by enigmatic star Johan Cruyff and praised by pundits the
world over for its fluent, attacking ``total football,'' the 1974
Dutch squad is widely regarded as the best team not to have won
soccer's greatest prize.
	   Organizers also are showing ``as a plaster on the wound,'' the
1974 match between East and West Germany which the East Germans won
1-0, dealing West Germany its only defeat of the finals.

IT was the elegant actress Audrey Hepburn who sparked the growth

<TEXT>
of one of the world's best-loved brands - and it's not Givenchy.
	   Yes, she may have adored the classy, shapely shifts designed by
Hubert de Givenchy but Audrey appeared alongside Gregory Peck in
the 1953 film Roman Holiday wearing a headscarf and so creating a
style that became an instant hit worldwide.
	   It was at exactly the same time that a young London couple,
Laura and Bernard Ashley, were starting to produce headscarves as
well as table mats and napkins on their kitchen table.
	   Their scarves were an immediate success in stores like John
Lewis and Heals, and put them on the road to becoming a company
which today has a turnover of around STG350 million and more than
530 shops worldwide.
	   The inspiration to start printing fabric came from a Women's
Institute exhibition of traditional crafts at London's Victoria 
Albert Museum.
	   When Laura looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs
in order to make patchwork, she found that no such fabric existed.
Here was an opportunity, she thought.
	   Laura designed the prints and Bernard built the printing
equipment, so forging a complementary relationship that was to give
the company strength through the years.
	   Laura remained in charge of design until shortly before her
death in 1985, while Bernard handled the operational side.
	   Bernard changed the company name from Ashley Mountney to the now
globally recognised Laura Ashley because he felt that a woman's
name was more appropriate for the products they were making.
	   The fashion foundation of the company was set in 1966 when Laura
produced her first social rather than work attire.
	   The long-length silhouette was to become the Laura Ashley
trademark. It was also to work successfully in the company's favour
as fashion switched from the mini to the maxi skirt at the end of
the 1960s.
	   Laura had tapped into the spirit of the time with her long,
flowing, comfortable dresses in muted tones and natural fabrics.
	   The Laura Ashley Basic Dress, as it was known, retailed at STG5
when the company opened its first shop in Pelham Street in South
Kensington, London, in 1968.
	   Also on sale were tea towels, oven gloves and flower sprigged
cotton fabrics.
	   The hallmarks of Laura Ashley like pretty prints and comfy,
natural materials have lived on to become modern classics.
	   Its newest boutique in Suria KLCC, Kuala Lumpur, is said to be
one of its biggest stores outside the UK, covering over 324 sq
metres.

SCORES of Hong Kong's large companies will freeze new hirings

<TEXT>
and trim down staff through natural attrition on top of various
belt-tightening measures already adopted to cope with the
recession.
	   Some companies admit they have slowed down investments including
projects overseas in view of the economic crisis plaguing the
region.
	   Other firms with expansion plans, such as the Mass Transit
Railway Corporation, plan to hire more staff for new projects.
	   Andrew Herdman, general manager for corporate affairs at John
Swire  Sons, said yesterday the conglomerate was known to be
cautious in various business activities in which it was currently
engaged. This strategy would be maintained in the coming months.
	   John Swire  Sons is the holding company of a host of Hong
Kong's large companies including Cathay Pacific and Swire
Properties.
	   ``We are known to be cautious and prudent in our investment
strategy. And in hindsight we do not regret that.'' He said each
company in the Swire Group had its own corporate strategy for the
year and it was the responsibility of individual managers to deal
with a particular situation.
	   On Cathay Pacific's recent decision to lay off an additional
1,000 staff, he said this was part of ongoing efforts to reduce
costs.
	   Mark Webb, corporate analyst at HSBC Securities, said the Swire
Group was known for not changing its corporate strategy for
short-term gains.
	   ``They are cautious in their investments in every kind of
situation,'' Mr Webb said.
	   Mr Herdman said Swire was investing extensively in China in
beverages and breweries, while its property division, Swire
Properties, had just won a tender to develop Aldrich Bay property
with other partners.
	   A spokeswoman at the Mass Transit Railway Corporation said it
had sound financial management and cost control.
	   ``Spending is based on budget planning so operating costs are
well contained,'' she said.
	   The spokeswoman added that ``on time and within budget'' is one
of the core values which had guided the daily activities of its
staff to ensure good performance in cost effective principles.
	   Ross Sayers, managing director of CLP Holdings and chairman of
the Employers' Federation of Hong Kong, said: ``Under the current
economic climate, it is particularly important for employers and
employees to work hand in hand for their mutual benefits.'' MTRC
said it was constructing new extensions to tie in with the
government's Railway Development Strategy.
	   ``With new extensions, new job opportunities are created,'' she
said.

LOCAL Panasonic distributor Siew-National expects the market for

<TEXT>
electrical appliances to slump 30 per cent this year because of
contracting consumer spending power, managing director Yoshimasa
Tamura said.
	   He said television sales have been particularly hard hit, and
are expected to total 950,000 units this year as against 1.05
million last year and 1.15 million in 1996.
	   The company predicted video player sales would reach 300,000
units this year and 16,000 units for video cameras. Total demand
for audio products is estimated at 135,000 home stereos, 224,000
mini-stereos and 470,000 general audio players.
	   Siew-National recently held a meeting with over 500 dealers
nationwide to announce its sales and marketing plans for the
1998/1999 fiscal year. The company said it would help dealers
through the liquidity crisis by minimising their inventories.
	   The company plans to shorten its delivery times to dealers with
its ''Panasonic Express'' programme. An initial 20 trucks are being
commissioned for rapid delivery to dealers.
	   The company said it has almost halved its delivery times to
dealers in the South, and reduced by around 30 per cent delivery
times to dealers in the Northeast and central Thailand, Tamura
said.
	   ''These difficult times require us to adapt to suit the
conditions,'' Tamura said, adding that Thailand is in a better
position than many other countries in the region. He said the Thai
spirit of enterprise, compromise and unity were the country's
biggest assets.
	   Panasonic, which controls 30 per cent of the market for
audio-visual products, posted a sales turnover of Bt9.7 billion for
fiscal 1997 ended March.
	   Sales by newly-established subsidiary Panasonic Industrial
(Thailand) Ltd for the fiscal year were disclosed at Bt1.2 billion.
	   Panasonic Industrial is an associated firm to which some of
Siew-National's components and industrial products business has
been transferred. Combined sales of Panasonic products totalled
Bt10.9 billion for fiscal 1997, up Bt790 million, or 7.75 per cent,
over the previous fiscal year.
	   Meanwhile, the director of Siew-National's consumer sales
division launched a consumer promotion backed by Bt30 million in
advertising and store decorations for retailers.

Sanchez Vicario beats Davenport for berth in finals
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Sanchez Vicario victory  
  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing at her gritty and relentless best, two-time
French Open champion Aranxta Sanchez Vicario won a spot in the
French Open finals Thursday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over an
error-prone Lindsay Davenport.
	   Davenport hit her groundstrokes with power, but had trouble
keeping them inside the baseline. She made 56 unforced errors, 34
of them in the second set. Sanchez Vcario had 29 the entire match.
	   The last point was typical. Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker,
Sanchez Vicario made a great get to send back a high defensive lob.
Davenport responded with an overhead, but it sailed wide.
	   ``I always think you have a chance if you get the ball back,''
Sanchez Vicario said, coming off the court.
	   In a match where service breaks were the rule, Davenport didn't
even hold serve once in the first set, and held serve only twice in
the second.
	   Sanchez Vicario herself held serve only twice in each set.
	   The sturdy Spaniard has had a long career at the top of women's
tennis, and has won three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and 1994
French Opens and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   Davenport, meanwhile, has never won a Grand Slam or even reached
the finals, despite being ranked second in the world.
	   She was perhaps the most modest semifinalist ever. Asked earlier
in the week if she felt overlooked, she replied, ``If I were a
betting person or a journalist, I'd overlook myself also.''
	   She described herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
A boring story.''
	   In an entire different position is Martina Hingis, set to play
Monica Seles in the day's other semifinal.
	   Hingis has little left to prove. The 17-year-old Swiss star is
at the top of her game, and her innate court sense and impeccable
timing have served her well this week. Only the French Open missing
from her collection of titles.
	   Her swift victory over Venus Williams in the quarterfinals only
outlined the gap between the two, despite hopes for a new rivalry
in women's tennis.
	   Hingis rolled through the first five rounds, losing just 21
games.
	   But the player with the most poignant story is Seles, playing
two weeks after the death of her father, mentor and coach, Karolj
Seles. She's managed to channel her grief into a renewed
determination to win here.
	   Playing with her father's ring around her neck, she says she
came here so soon after his death because the memories at home were
just too painful. And, of course, because ``my dad would have loved
me to play.''
	   Beating Novotna in the quarters, she clenched her fist and
scrunched her face into a victory grimace that made it clear how
much she wants this title, which she's won three times before.
	   But the crowd's emotional support won't be enough; she has to be
at her very best. Hingis has defeated Seles all five times they've
played.
	   The men had a day off Thursday, which is a relief for the weary
Cedric Pioline.
	   The Frenchman withstood five sets of sloppy and often tedious
tennis Wednesday to became the only non-Spaniard in the men's
semifinals.
	   His 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win over Morocco's Hicham
Arazi _ a match marred by 149 unforced errors _ put him in the
semifinals with Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla.
	   ``I was so tired and I had break points against me practically
in every game. I saved some of them by miracle,'' Pioline said.
	   He became the first Frenchman to reach the semifinals at Roland
Garros since Henri Leconte in 1992. Just two Frenchmen have won the
title since World War II, with Yannick Noah the most recent in
1983.
	   Arazi, who played most of the match with a blistered left foot,
converted only five of his 21 break points.
	   ``I'm going to jump into the Seine River,'' he cracked. ``The
thing that really did me in is that I stayed too much on the
baseline.''
	   Pioline, who has played three five-set matches in the
tournament, will have a day to rest before facing Corretja in
Friday's semifinals.
	   Corretja made just 18 unforced errors while reaching his first
Grand Slam semifinal by defeating Belgium's Filip Dewulf 7-5, 6-4,
6-3.
	   ``This is history,'' Corretja said. ``It's not easy to have a
country put three guys in the semis of a Grand Slam. We used to see
the American guys in other tournaments, but not the Spanish guys.''

TWENTY-FOUR international financial institutions cooperated to

<TEXT>
grant Bangchak Petroleum Plc a US$150-million, one-year loan with
the Finance Ministry acting as guarantor.
	   The loan contract was signed on Monday in Hong Kong.
	   According to a statement from Bangchak, the loan was
oversubscribed by 45 per cent. Twenty-four foreign banks had
offered to lend Bangchak $220 million, compared to the company's
demand of $150 million, said Bangchak president Sophon Suphapong.
	   The loan comes with an interest rate of 0.9 per cent above the
London Interbank Offered Rate.
	   The lenders include 17 financial institutions from Europe, five
from Asia, and one each from the US and Canada. Arranger banks are
ABN Amro NV, BA Asia Ltd, The Bank of Nova Scotia Asia Ltd,
Barclays Capital, Standard Chartered Bank and Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
	   Sommai Pasi, director general of the Finance Ministry's Fiscal
Policy Office, said the loan contract reflects the increasing
confidence of foreign banks in Thailand's financial sector as well
as Bangchak's business potential.
	   Bangchak said earlier that the loan proceeds will be used as
working capital to pay for imported crude oil in substitute for
short-term loans that banks had previously withdrawn in favour of
Bangchak.
	   Bangchak's senior vice president Wuthichai Vongsanguan said the
loan will help add liquidity to the country.
	   It is the first syndicated loan that Bangchak has received with
a guarantee provided by the Finance Ministry. New loans provided by
foreign banks to Thai private companies are rare since the economic
crisis hit the country in mid-97.
	   Listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, Bangchak is owned 48
per cent by the Finance Ministry.
	   In the first quarter, Bangchak posted a Bt381-million net profit
on total revenues of Bt10 billion. The company is operating a
120,000 barrel per day oil refinery and 1,200 oil retailing
stations.
	   Bangchak's privatisation plan, which is part of the government's
commitment made to the International Monetary Fund, is being
delayed by opposition from its management, non-governmental
organisations and many leading social figures in the country.

DESPITE the government's recent decision to provide an

<TEXT>
additional Bt8 billion to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand, the state-owned power utility has said it will go ahead
with its plan to issue a US$300 million World Bank-backed bond in
the international market, an official said.
	   Egat's assistant governor for accounting and finance, Angoon
Kamolyabutr, said the easing of conditions in the International
Monetary Fund's fourth letter of intent will help to reduce Egat's
liquidity problem. Otherwise it would have to utilise its working
capital for investment in its on-going projects.
	   ''Earlier, we would have had to use our working capital worth
Bt10-20 billion for funding our committed projects with no new loan
borrowing support. This could have caused us liquidity problems,''
she said.
	   The Cabinet approved the fourth letter of intent on Tuesday
which includes an allowance on state enterprises to have a budget
deficit and a Finance Ministry plan to launch global bonds worth $5
billion.
	   The Bt8-billion additional budget going to Egat is expected to
be available in July after the government completes the first
global bond raising, according to Angoon.
	   Of the total, half will be for financing the construction of the
Ratchaburi combined cycle units 1-3, Bt570 million for the Krabi
Power Station project, Bt540 million for the Lam Takong
pump-storage project, Bt600 million for the installation of sulphur
removal units for the Mae Moh Power Plant units 4-11, and Bt488
million for the Wang Noi Power Station and transmission line
improvement project.
	   Angoon said Egat will push ahead with its plan to launch a
$300-million bond in the international market. The bond, with
guarantees from the World Bank, is planned to be issued after the
government issues its global bond.
	   Egat is also proposing to the government to approve Bt9.8
billion as additional working capital support for the agency.
	   The Japanese export and import bank has agreed to provide loans
for the purchase of machinery for Egat's Ratchaburi Power Project
at 2.3 per cent interest rate above the London Interbank Offered
Rate for the plant's combined-cycle units and at 2.5 per cent above
the Libor rate for the thermal units.

THE Cabinet is likely to withdraw the licences of Alpha

<TEXT>
International Insurance Ltd, Pacific Union Insurance Ltd and Safety
World Insurance Ltd after the three failed to place bank deposit
guarantees and to mobilise insurance reserve funds as required.
	   The three companies are among 28 new insurance licencees
approved last year. The rest have already set up 13 companies for
general insurance and 12 for life insurance.
	   Licencees are supposed to raise capital funds and place the
deposit within six months after approval. The deposit amount is at
least five per cent of a company's registered capital.
	   New life insurance companies have to mobilise at least Bt500
million to start operations, while new general insurance firms need
at least Bt300 million, according to General Insurance Act 2535 and
Life Insurance Act 2535.
	   Alpha International Insurance was formed by Charn Asawachoke, a
major shareholder of Alphatech Electronics Plc.
	   Pacific Union Insurance Ltd is established by individual
investors, including Chawalit Yodmanee, Chatuporn
Singhanartkathakul, and Pipat Pusayanon.
	   Safety World Insurance is owned by individual investors and
companies, including Nikorn Pornsathit of Wattachak Group, Property
Leasing Co Ltd, Night Spot Productions Co Ltd and Auto Center Co
Ltd.
	   The parent companies of the new insurance firms are all
cash-strapped.
	   The Insurance Department made an inquiry with the commercial
banks which guaranteed the deposits of the three firms for the
deposit payment. But the banks refused the request.
	   Altogether, the payment is worth Bt46 million.
	   Alpha International Insurance later settled its deposit
requirement but failed to complete its mobilisation.

PROTESTERS yesterday criticised the government taskforce on

<TEXT>
employment for not having adequate representation from labour
organisations.
	   About 60 people representing three labour groups marched on the
SAR Government Headquarters in Central as the taskforce was about
to hold its first meeting yesterday.
	   Brandishing banners and chanting slogans, the marchers urged the
government to take decisive action to solve the problem of
unemployment as quickly as possible.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, who chaired the
meeting, received petition letters from the Federation of Trade
Unions (FTU) and the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour
Unions (FLU).
	   Sir Donald said before the meeting that views on solving the
problem would be gathered from different levels of society in a
series of meetings.
	   He said the taskforce could at least ease public anxiety over
the situation.
	   Adding their voice to the public protest were representatives
from the Coalition of Women's Rights for Employment, who slammed
the government for doing superficial work in tackling the problem.
	   The coalition called on the government to establish an
unemployment fund to help the jobless make ends meet during the
crisis.
	   Lam Ying-hing of the Hong Kong Women Workers' Association, a
member group of the coalition, said female workers, mostly
non-technical staff, were always the first to suffer or be expelled
from the labour market during difficult times.
	   ``The government's lack of concern and protection for women
workers existed five to six years ago and it is a failure in (the
government's) economic policies,'' Ms Lam said.
	   She was worried that the limited number of taskforce members
from labour groups might not be adequate to reflect the situation
and voice the need for the protection of female workers. She
criticised the creation of the taskforce, accusing it of being
designed to lessen public protests on unemployment.

TWO big manufacturers of fizzy drinks in the UK have given the

<TEXT>
assurance that their products in Malaysia are safe from benzene
contamination.
	   Officials of Smithkline Beecham, manufacturers of Lucozade and
Sparkling Ribena, and Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages confirmed
that their products sold in Malaysia were not contaminated.
	   ``Our products for the Southeast Asian market are manufactured
by our plants in Malaysia and they are not affected,'' a Smithkline
Beecham headquarters official told the New Straits Times yesterday.
	   However, the company is awaiting the results of laboratory tests
on its products made in the UK.
	   It was reported in the British papers that 52 million cans and
bottles of fizzy drinks and carbonated mineral water were withdrawn
from shops in the UK this week after tests showed they could be
contaminated with benzene.
	   Benzene, a cancer causing poison, was discovered in supplies of
carbon dioxide used in the production of the drinks.
	   The contaminated carbon dioxide came from the Terra Nitrogen
(UK) plant at Severnside near Bristol. The company supplies liquid
carbon dioxide to most of the soft drinks industry in Britain.
	   The contamination was discovered by a mineral water company
during routine testing.
	   An official of Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages said the
contaminated consignment, manufactured at one of its six UK canning
factories, was not exported to Malaysia. The official said only a
limited number of its 330ml canned products was affected.
	   Consumers who still had doubts could call the company in the UK
at 01895-231313 and quote the stock code at the bottom of the can
for verification.

THE country's economic recession and the baht flotation have

<TEXT>
helped reduce the volume of oil smuggling, according to an official
from the National Energy Policy Office (Nepo).
	   The official cited the declining volume of illegal oil seized by
government agencies as a sign of a reduction in oil smuggling
activities. Officials seized 1.7 million of smuggled oil during
January to May this year, compared to 1.9 million litres in the
same period of 1997.
	   Last year, the amount of smuggled oil seized by government
agencies was put at 2.4 million litres, a huge drop from 14.13
million litres in 1996.
	   The Nepo official said the big fall in oil smuggling activities
was a result of the low profit margin on imported smuggled oil
after the baht depreciation and reduced petrol consumption.
	   Oil smugglers have been affected by rising costs of smuggled
products and falling profit margins. In addition, the growth in
petrol consumption has been pared back from eight per cent to one
per cent, while diesel consumption has shrunk by 16 per cent,
compared to five per cent growth prior to the economic downturn.
	   The installation of meters at offshore oil terminals has also
helped to improve the situation. Thirty-seven meters were installed
in 1997. The installation of the remaining 58 will be completed by
1999.
	   Nepo will allocate Bt700 million for the last 58 meters, of
which 39 will be set up at petrol terminals and 19 at diesel
terminals.
	   The Excise Department is ready to take bids for the installation
contract.

Six young women and a minor girl, who returned to the country

<TEXT>
from Pakistan last week, are now staying at Prashanti', a shelter
home run by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association
(BNWLA) in the city.
	   Meanwhile, the guardians of three women have been identified but
BNWLA officials are hesitating to hand over the women to them
because, according to them, traffickers are still on the prowl in
their areas.
	   The three women: Meena of Bhola, Ruma of Demra in the city and
Bilkis of Comilla narrated to BNWLA officials their tales of
captivity. The BNWLA said, it has brought back only seven persons
out of more than 100 women and children trafficked away to
Pakistan.
	   The traffickers maintain contact with the law enforcing
personnel of India and Pakistan, the officials alleged.
	   According to Meena, she was a machine operator of Khwaja
Garments at Kalyanpur in the city before she had been trafficked
away to Pakistan about two years ago.
	   One Altaf handed her over to his sister, Shilpi, at Gulshanibagh
in Pakistan, Meena said, adding that she was later rescued by
police and sent to Edi Homes' in Karachi.
	   In her statement, Ruma-wife of Anu, said she was introduced to
one Mostafa at Ranimahal' cinema hall and he took her to Pakistan
by road via India about a year ago.
	   Mostafa sold her to Moulavi' at Musa Colony in Karachi.
	   According to Ruma, she saw a girl named Rina in the house of
Moulavi.
	   Bilkis, daughter of one Abdur Rab, was taken to Pakistan by one
Dil Mohammad about seven years back. Bilkis was a class VIII
student of Iliotganj Bazar High School at the time.
	   Dil Mohammad, having two wives and five children in Karachi,
tried to marry Bilkis keeping her at his sister's residence there
but she escaped from the house and got into a bus, Bilkis said.
	   Seeing her weeping in the bus, one Sabina took her to her house
and handed her over to Edi Homes' after four days, Bilkis said.
	   The traffickers took her with four other girls and seven Myanmar
children, she added.
	   The other three women brought back to the country are Nurjahan,
Jobaida and Shahnaz.
	   Nurjahan, daughter of Hossain Ahmed of Palongkhali under Ukhia
thana in Cox's Bazar district, was one of the 60 children and women
who were trafficked away to Pakistan about seven years back. They
were caught several times during their stay in India and Pakistan
but every time they were released in exchange for money, Nurjahan
said.
	   She escaped from the residence of Ekhlas, to whom she was sold
in exchange for Rs 6,000, after three years and took shelter at Edi
Homes'.
	   A resident of Ukhia, Jobaida, along with her daughter, Rahima,
went to Pakistan with her second husband, Nurul Alam, about one
year ago.
	   Her husband sold her to one Mohammad Ali but she was arrested by
police and later she took shelter in Edi Homes'. Police also
arrested Mohammad Ali but released him later on, she said.
	   Shahnaz, daughter of Hakim of the city's Gulshan area, said,
Alamgir who proposed to marry her took her to Pakistan via Delhi
and kept her in his sister's house in Lahore. She escaped from the
house after two months and took shelter at Edi Homes', she said.
	   She and Alamgir were arrested several times by Indian and
Pakistani police but they were released in exchange for money, she
added.

PULAU Ketam, one of the islands off Port Klang, is another

<TEXT>
hidden asset for the tourism industry of Malaysia. It is a
destination where one can get to see and experience a cohesive and
self-contained fishing village together with fish farms virtually
in the middle of the sea.
	   The route by using the scheduled ferries to Pulau Ketam is
dotted by mangrove trees. To me this journey makes a relaxing
weekend.
	   It is on my return trips to Pulau Ketam on three occasions that
I noted and hoped that the relevant authorities would take
appropriate action before any disaster strikes. The following are
my observations: There is no enforcement to ensure the safety of
passengers boarding and alighting from the ferries either at Port
Klang or at Pulau Ketam.
	   There is no control over the number of passengers the ferries
can take and it is often overloaded. I hope the authorities will
consider using bigger and stronger ferries like those used by the
Penang Port Commission.
	   The place and the terminals where these ferries operate from are
a disused loading/unloading warehouse. It is not a proper facility
and can project an ugly image especially since we are now competing
with our neighbours for an efficient port of call not only for
cargo but also passenger liners.
	   Although there is a purpose-built ferry terminal at Pulau Ketam,
it is dangerous because the pontoonfloats with the water level and
the concrete steps don't. So the ferries cannot go close to the
steps, thus rendering it dangerous for boarding and alighting.
	   I hope the authorities would look into this and do the necessary
to improve the situation. Otherwise we are just waiting for a
disaster.

SINGAPORE -- The economic crisis has prevented several big Thai

<TEXT>
telecom companies from participating in CommunicAsia 98,
Singapore's second-largest trade fair and exhibition of the year.
	   About 10 small and medium-sized Thai firms are putting on a show
in partnership with the Telephone Organisation of Thailand. The
event will end tomorrow.''It's very hard to convince the big firms
to join in during the present state of the economy. Our Thai
Pavilion looks smaller this year,'' a TOT officer said.
	   In previous years, CommunicAsia, an annual show now in its 12th
year, was a major event which few Thai executives and IT personnel
dared to miss. They considered it significant for business and for
learning of new technologies.Some Thai companies paid for all of
their engineers and marketing teams to visit the event. There have
been no reports of such spending this year.
	   ''It's been kind of quiet this year compared to the previous
years,'' a Singapore IT reporter said.
	   Of the 5,000 visitors to the show which began on Tuesday, only a
few came from Thailand while about 30 per cent were from overseas.
The Communications Authority of Thailand, a state agency, is not
participating.''The CAT has to save costs. So we turned down our
plan to join the technology show,'' Sawait Satanond, CAT
vice-president, said.
	   The TOT spent Bt3 million to lease a space to be shared with
nine Thai companies which paid TOT about Bt200,000 each to
construct their own booths.
	   Loxley has an area along with other Thai firms which are mostly
in equipment and software supply. They are Advanced Information
System Ltd, Intel Card Industries Co, Lucent Technologies, NEC
Communication Thailand, YHI Temasek (Thailand), Bangkok Payment
Technologies Co Ltd, Expert Communication Co Ltd, Power Telecom and
Thai Satellite Telecommunications Co (TSC).
	   TSC Wednesday introduced a convergence of satellite
communications to be provided by Iridium, its flagship service. TSC
plans to start Iridium communications service in the third quarter
of this year.
	   Banapot Damapong, a senior executive of the Shinawatra Group who
accompanied owner Dr Thaksin Shinawatra to the show, said
Shinawatra didn't join the show.
	   ''We did not have any new products or services to show this
year. (Thaksin) believes that everyone who joins the exhibition
wants to see technology advances rather than to see how big the
show is,'' Banapot said.
	   According to a report by CommunicAsia organisers, the show this
year attracted about 18,000 exhibitors from telecom and information
and technology industries.
	   The highlight of the TOT-hosted Thai Pavilion is the new public
chip telephone card developed by TOT. It is considered Thailand's
first developed telecom product.
	   The card phone service will be launched during the Asian Games
at the end of the year in Thailand.
	   Currently, the TOT has only 1,050 chip telephone cards and plans
to produce about 2000 more.
	   Deputy secretary-general of the International Telecommunications
Union Henry Chasia was quoted as saying at the opening ceremony
that the ongoing deregulation process will give the Asia-Pacific
region 35 per cent of the global wireless market by the year 2000.
	   Currently, the Asia-Pacific region only shares about 20 per cent
of the world's telephone lines, although 53 per cent of the world's
population lives in the region, he said.

FORMER employees of the collapsed Maria's Bakery are expected to

<TEXT>
be rehired when the cake shop chain reopens for business next month
under the same name but with a new owner.
	   The prospects of re-employment for laid-off workers of Maria's
loomed as edible oils manufacturer Hop Hing announced yesterday it
would purchase various business assets of Maria's, including its
fixtures and equipment at its retail outlets, for a new chain of
bake shops.
	   The exact number of former Maria's employees that would be
rehired remains unclear because talks for the renewal of leases of
Maria's cake shops are still going on.
	   The cake shop chain will use the name Maria's Bakery, which has
been a household name since the 1960s.
	   Hop Hing would provide as many jobs as possible to former
Maria's employees, Hop Hing chairman Hung Hak-hip said.
	   He said between 10 and 15 people would be employed in big cake
shops and five to six in smaller shops.
	   ``We hope to reopen the 20 outlets of Maria's Bakery, but we're
not sure if we can do this because this depends on the progress of
the ongoing talks with the landowners,'' Mr Hung said.
	   Hop Hing had not decided what it would do about cake coupons
issued by Maria's and which have not been redeemed by former
customers, he said.
	   ``There is no concrete plan that we can announce at this stage
because Hop Hing has just signed a purchase agreement with Maria's
liquidators Ernst  Young. We have to study it in detail with the
liquidators,'' Mr Hung said.
	   He said Hop Hing would not take responsibility for any liability
that Maria's had incurred over the redemption of its coupons by two
cake shop chains.
	   The two firms were said to be planning to take Maria's to court
for non-payment of cakes bought with the coupons by the former
customers of the collapsed bakery.
	   Meanwhile, consumer complaints for the first four months of this
year rose 74 per cent amid the economic downturn.
	   More than a quarter of the complaints filed with the Consumer
Council arose from the closure of Maria's Bakery on 29 April, which
resulted in inquiries involving cakes worth over $3.5 million.
	   There were 5,489 complaints to the council in the first four
months of the year. The total for the whole of 1997 was a record
11,535.
	   ``The rising trend in consumer complaints has continued since
the present economic slowdown in the latter part of last year,''
the council said.
	   The council is urging businesses to consider self-insurance
schemes and self-indemnity funds, in order to increase consumer
confidence.
	   ``We would like to see a stable market,'' chairperson Anna Wu
Hung-yuk said.
	   She urged consumers to weigh up the pros and cons when buying
into pre-payment schemes such as cake tokens, branding as
``ridiculous'' those who store up multiple coupons.
	   ``Consumers must balance the benefit of convenience against the
security of their deposit,'' she said.
	   ``When there is a large number of cake coupons in the hands of
one individual, that is ridiculous.''

Armed dacoits robbed cash and other valuables from the

<TEXT>
passengers of a launch in the river Tetulia under Dashmina thana
last night. At least 30 passengers were injured as the dacoits
attacked them.
	   Witnesses said, MV Prince of Barguna started its journey on
Wednesday afternoon on the Barisal-Char Biswas route.
	   As the vessel started from Char Bholasing ghat in the evening,
about 12 masked dacoits, in the guise of passengers, took control
of the launch at gun point. The dacoits beat up the passengers of
the launch and snatched cash, gold ornaments and other belongings
worth about Tk 20 lakh from the passengers. At least 30 passengers
were injured in the attack.
	   The dacoits got down from the launch into a trawler that drew
near it in the vicinity of Char Fashion.
	   Five of injured were admitted to the Dashmina Thana Health
Complex in critical condition. They are: Purna Chandra Mondol (35),
Moslem Bepari (35), Serajul Mridha (40), Milan Shikder (30) and
Rafiqul Islam (28).
	   This was the third incident of big dacoity in Barisal region
during the last one month. Earlier, the dacoits looted three rifles
with 64 bullets from a launch in Baleswar river on May 1.

Khomeini's grandson calls for unity, praises Khatami
</HEADLINE>
  By EARLEEN FISHER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With the rift widening between supporters
and foes of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, the grandson of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Iranians toward unity Thursday on
the anniversary of the revolutionary patriarch's death.
	   ``Today Khatami is the man who is providing the best assistance
for the thoughts of Imam Khomeini and the current leadership of the
country,'' Hassan Khomeini said. ``Khatami is establishing the
pillars of the thinking of the Imam in the society.''
	   The young Khomeini spoke to a huge crowd at the late cleric's
gold-domed shrine outside Tehran during a ceremony marking the
ninth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death.
	   Like President Khatami, Hassan Khomeini is a mid-level cleric.
Both wear black turbans identifying them as direct descendants of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ an important sign of political and
religious prestige in this overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim nation.
	   Hassan Khomeini, thought to be in his mid-20s, also invoked a
familiar theme of the Islamic revolution that toppled the
pro-American Shah in 1979 and installed a fundamentalist
government:
	   ``Whoever talks about relations with the U.S. government ... is
far from the thinking of the Imam (Ayatollah Khomeini).''
	   Invoking the words of his late grandfather, Hassan Khomeini said
midway through his 40-minute speech: ``Relations with the United
States are as (impossible as) relations between the wolf and the
lamb.''
	   That brought the crowd to its feet in the Iranian revolution's
battle cry of ``death to America.''
	   Khatami, a relative moderate who was elected president a year
ago in a landslide victory over hard-liners, has advocated dialogue
between the Iranian and American peoples _ but not their
governments. Khatami attended Thursday's ceremony but did not
speak.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the late Khomeini's successor as Iran's
supreme spiritual and political leader, addressed the crowd in an
unusually quiet voice and spoke for less than 15 minutes.
	   Vehemently anti-American but less outspoken on the subject since
Khatami's election, Khamenei praised Iran's youth as the hope of
the Islamic revolution and called the United States and Israel
``the defeated enemies of Islam.''
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
death, Khamenei has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``My friends and doctors would not allow me to talk longer than
this,'' the 58-year-old Khamenei said.
	   Journalists who regularly cover Khamenei said he had a bad cold
but the ailment was not serious.
	   The crowd appeared to number in the tens of thousands, not the
hundreds of thousands that came in previous years.

LOCAL banks are expected to lend Bt6 billion to the sugarcane

<TEXT>
and sugar industry this month to help ease the liquidity shortage
facing the industry, said Thamnu Wasinon, deputy permanent
secretary of the Industry Ministry.
	   The funding promise came after an urgent meeting convened by the
government Wednesday to solve the liquidity crunch affecting the
cane and sugar industry before the harvest begins later this month.
Deputy Prime Minister Suwit Khunkitti chaired the meeting, which
was also attended by officials from the Bank of Thailand, the Bank
for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), the office of
the Cane and Sugar Board and other agencies involved.
	   The loan is still short of the Bt10 billion the cane and sugar
industry is estimated to require.
	   However, Thamnu said the Bt6 billion in funding will be
sufficient for the initial period, especially to finance the coming
harvest. Without it, cane output in the 1998-1999 season will not
reach the projection of 45 million tonnes. Thailand produced about
42 million tonnes of cane in the 1997-1998 season.
	   Sugar is among Thailand's top 10 exports, and the country is one
of the world's top four exporters of sugar.
	   Of the total loan, BAAC will provide Bt3 billion, the Government
Savings Bank Bt2 billion and the Bank of Thailand and commercial
banks Bt1 billion. However, the central bank said it will have to
talk with local banks to conclude the exact funding figure.
	   The loan is expected to come with a 15 per cent interest rate,
Thamnu said.
	   The official said the cane and sugar office is still negotiating
with foreign banks for a US$80 million loan to support sugar mills
and cane growers. For collateral, 400,000 tonnes of sugar exports
under the B quota have been offered.

TO create real fashion today, one must skilfully navigate

<TEXT>
between the extremes of exaggerated ``pauperism'' on the one hand,
and overdone exhibitionism on the other. Hence, minimalism and
flamboyance usually become the keywords of fashion.
	   For Giorgio Armani's diffusion line, Emporio Armani, his trend
is one that keeps clearly in sight a young woman with high spirits
and sense of wit, and who takes pride in her body.
	   This is why the new spring/summer 1998 collection presents an
upbeat point of view with the focus on healthy allure.
	   There is certainty in the clean lines of the irreplacable suit,
which is never treated as a banal uniform at Emporio.
	   The Emporio repertoire stresses extremely feminine jackets
-completely unstructured, weightless shirt-jackets, narrow sleeves
and softer details like small, rounded and unpressed lapels.
	   Swingy, little skirts or trousers are worn with sexy tops while
large organza shawls are knotted over skirts or worn alone like a
pareo if you like.
	   There are long, slim-cut blazers to wear with soft, short skirts
and dresses or over flat-front trousers, straight-legged or flared
at the hem.
	   The interesting aspect about the trousers is the way they are
worn -with colourful little geometrical tops, or with a
long-fringed scarf tied around the hips that drop the waist and
transforms the silhouette.
	   Contrasting colours create their own geometry, playing an
important role to lighten up the sombre, serious suit.
	   Emporio fabrics are another certainty where soft wool and
wool-and-viscose mix with marked surface weaves are the stars of
the suit collection while light chiffons, organzas, solid and
devore georgettes are made into dresses.
	   Colours featured are mostly black and blue that are broken up
into other shades like brown, green and violet and of course, the
``Armani naturals''
	   in tones of grey and moleskin.
	   For evening, understated dresses that bare some erogenous zones
are elegantly detailed with silk, jet and sequin embroidery on shot
organza or tulle.
	   What's new is the way things are personalised. For instance, the
short black slipdresses in beaded tulle are worn with masculine
black jackets, a bit oversized, as if borrowed from a boyfriend.
	   The organza dresses, also short and beaded, are paired with
light, feminine skirts in iridescent gauze, while skirts hemmed at
the ankle are paired with assymetrical tops.
	   Meanwhile, his collection for men takes on a free and liberating
form with a focus on young people and their dynamic lifestyles.
	   The attraction of the latest jackets is in their abbreviated
proportions, their versatile function of shirt-cum-jacket and
sometimes, military style detailing.
	   The cotton-and-polyester sweaters, often in two tones, are
further defined by jacquard motifs and slim-fitting tailoring for
both the short or long versions.
	   This time, the range presents a large choice of sportswear from
the lightest of unlined leather shirt-jackets in very pale or
extremely dark colours, pleatless trousers, sleeveless
singlet-style shirts to trousers with bibs and straps that become
overalls or sarongs! The same can be said of the swimwear line,
dominated by a techno/ethno spirit in both the styles and
materials.
	   Together with the surfing outfits in elasticised high-tech
materials closed by large contrasting zips, there are both short
and long North African-inspired pants in the softest cotton.

Sanchez Vicario beats Davenport for berth in finals
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with more Sanchez Vicario quotes; TRIMS.  
  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing at her gritty and relentless best, two-time
French Open champion Aranxta Sanchez Vicario won a spot in the
finals Thursday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over an error-prone
Lindsay Davenport.
	   Davenport hit her groundstrokes with power, but had trouble
keeping them inside the lines. She made 56 unforced errors, 34 of
them in the second set. Sanchez Vicario had 29 the entire match.
	   The last point was typical. Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker,
Sanchez Vicario made a great get to send back a high defensive lob.
Davenport responded with an overhead, but it sailed wide.
	   ``I always think you have a chance if you get the ball back,''
Sanchez Vicario said, coming off the court.
	   Of Davenport, she said, ``I know she was very tired, and I just
had to just hang in there.''
	   In a match where service breaks were the rule, Davenport didn't
even hold serve once in the first set, and held serve only twice in
the second.
	   Sanchez Vicario herself held serve only twice in each set.
	   The sturdy Spaniard has had a long career at the top of women's
tennis, and has won three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and 1994
French Opens and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   Davenport, meanwhile, has never won a Grand Slam or even reached
the finals, despite being ranked second in the world.
	   She was perhaps the most modest semifinalist ever. Asked earlier
in the week if she felt overlooked, she replied, ``If I were a
betting person or a journalist, I'd overlook myself also.''
	   She described herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
A boring story.''
	   In an entire different position is Martina Hingis, set to play
Monica Seles in the day's other semifinal.
	   The 17-year-old Swiss star is at the top of her game, and her
innate court sense and impeccable timing have served her well this
week. Only the French Open is missing from her collection of
titles.
	   Her swift victory over Venus Williams in the quarterfinals only
outlined the gap between the two, despite hopes for a new rivalry
in women's tennis.
	   Hingis rolled through the first five rounds, losing just 21
games.
	   But the player with the most poignant story is Seles, playing
two weeks after the death of her father, mentor and coach, Karolj
Seles. She's managed to channel her grief into a renewed
determination to win here.
	   Playing with her father's ring around her neck, she says she
came here because the memories at home were just too painful. And,
of course, because ``my dad would have loved me to play.''
	   Beating Novotna in the quarters, she clenched her fist and
scrunched her face into a victory grimace that made it clear how
much she wants this title, which she's won three times before.
	   But the crowd's emotional support won't be enough; she has to be
at her very best. Hingis has defeated Seles all five times they've
played.
	   The men had a day off Thursday, which is a relief for the weary
Cerd in the men's
semifinals.
	   His 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win over Morocco's Hicham
Arazi _ a match marred by 149 unforced errors _ put him in the
semifinals with Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla.
	   Pioline faces Corretja Friday.
	   Corretja made just 18 unforced errors while reaching his first
Grand Slam semifinal by defeating Belgium's Filip Dewulf 7-5, 6-4,
6-3.

Armed muggers stabbed two young men and cut off tendons of one

<TEXT>
in the Dhaka University area in the early hours on Wednesday.
	   According to hospital sources, seven to eight muggers called
Emon Ali (30) and Joynal (30) out of their Nimtoly residence at
about 3 am and took them near the Nutrition Institution of Dhaka
University. There they cut off tendons of Emon Ali and stabbed
another indiscriminately.
	   It is learnt that the victims informed the police of their
snatching bid in the Nimtoly in the evening. The incident might be
a sequel to that incident, sources added.
	   Both of them were rushed to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital
(DMCH) and later shifted to the Pongu Hospital.

THE new allowance adjustment mechanism will increase the

<TEXT>
openness and accountability if the Provisional Urban Council,
members and academics agree.
	   Citizens Party core member Manuel Chan Tim-shing, a member of
the council's allowance sub-committee, said the new system was
sufficient to make the councillors accountable.
	   Legislator-elect Fred Li Wah-ming of the Democratic Party, who
is also a member of the PUC, agreed that there was no need for an
independent body to decide on any allowance adjustment.
	   Mr Li did not think the municipal council should be modelled on
the Legislative Council.
	   Both councillors believed a healthy mechanism could ensure the
openness and accountability of the council, especially in the
remuneration and reimbursement of expenses of its
politician-members.
	   Li Pang-kwong, lecturer of Lingnan College's Department of
Politics and Sociology, put his trust in the media and a watchful
public.
	   ``Pressure from the public and the media are the best guarantee
of openness and accountability,'' Dr Li said.
	   He doubted the wisdom of setting up an independent body to
adjust the monthly allowance of politicians, including members of
the 18 district boards and the 60 members of Legco.
	   ``If there is an independent body, it must be set up by the
executive authority,'' he said.
	   He warned that this would only be a waste of resources as the
public would have to shoulder administrative costs.
	   Under the new mechanism, the allowances for members of the
council would be adjusted according to the Hang Seng Consumer Price
Index.
	   The public can check the receipts and reimbursement forms of
politician-members and the entire mechanism would be reviewed every
three years.
	   The monthly allowance would be divided between working allowance
and special allowance.
	   The working allowance could be claimed through reimbursement
with the use of receipts and would not be taxed.
	   Receipts would not be required for the special allowance, but
this would be taxed like a regular remuneration.

BANK of Thailand governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul confirmed

<TEXT>
Wednesday that state-run Krung Thai Bank would soon launch another
recapitalisation round to increase liquidity and meet new
provisioning rules.
	   He said he did not know how much the bank was raising. He
speculated that Krung Thai Bank would raise funds in several
tranches.
	   ''As the new rules will be fully effective in 2000, the bank may
raise sufficient funds for a year before raising the additional
amount in the next few years,'' Chatu Mongol said after a meeting
with the bank's president Sirin Nimmanahaeminda.
	   The meeting followed reports which quoted bank sources saying
Krung Thai would raise its registered capital by as much as Bt70
billion to a total of Bt100 billion.
	   KTB recently increased its capital by Bt20 billion. The amount
is considered insufficient to cover the expected rise in
non-performing loans caused by the three-month stop-accrual
interest income. Capital Nomura Securities Plc estimates KTB's
non-performing loans will stand at 38.65 per cent of total loans
this year, 35.50 per cent next year and 29.58 per cent in 2000.
	   As the authorities have commanded that all banks set aside 20
per cent of the required amount at the end of this year, Krung Thai
Bank requires Bt17.7 billion, according to the CNS report. A
requirement to set aside 60 per cent of that amount at the end of
1999 means the bank will need an additional Bt42.3 billion, and a
requirement to set aside the full amount in 2000 means it must
reserve Bt21.7 billion more.
	   Chatu Mongol said Wednesday that Krung Thai's current capital
was not sufficient to adhere to the rule requiring all banks to
stop accruing interest income after loans were three-months
overdue.
	   As it is 11.91-per-cent and 59.11-per-cent owned by the Finance
Ministry and the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF)
respectively, the two major shareholders will have to inject a huge
amount into the bank to subscribe to the new shares.
	   Asked if the FIDF, under the BOT's control, would maintain its
current stake in the bank, Chatu Mongol said that depended on the
Finance Ministry as the FIDF held the stake on behalf of the
ministry.
	   ''The ministry will have to fund the purchase. The ministry is
in talks with the Asian Development Bank for the funds,'' he said.
	   Wednesday Krung Thai Bank's share price crashed as investors
bailed out ahead of an expected Bt70-billion share issue. The
shares slumped 6.9 per cent, or Bt0.40 to Bt5.40.
	   Regarding the privatisation of the four nationalised banks,
Chatu Mongol said US investment bank J P Morgan, assigned to study
the privatisation, had separated the banks' bad and good assets and
concluded there were two options for the sales of the banks.
	   He declined to specify the options.
	   ''Whatever option we choose, there will be only one licence
issued this year. We [BOT and J P Morgan] will discuss it again
this month,'' he said.
	   He told reporters the BOT was inclined to sell the licence to a
large foreign bank which could better support the expansion of a
Thai bank.
	   The J P Morgan report is expected to be finalised by the end of
this month.

THE Thailand Financial Accounting Standard Board (TFASB), just

<TEXT>
set up by three government agencies, is scheduled to complete the
internationalisaton of accounting standards and corporate
management responsibilities for distorted information by December.
	   Nontaphon Nimsomboon, of the Auditor-General Office of Thailand,
said the board was established by the office, the Finance Ministry
and the Department of Commercial Registration.
	   He said the board will be responsible for investigating the
auditing procedures used by auditors and executives who produce
financial statements.
	   The working group of the TFASB -- auditors from the private and
public sectors and academics -- are studying the matter in line
with World Bank proposals.
	   The World Bank granted a loan of US$343,000 to help improve
Thailand's accounting standards. The loan is not included in the
$400 million which the World Bank lent to Thailand.
	   The proposal noted that the auditing process used by local
companies should be discontinued and a board established with the
authority to oversee the auditors.
	   Nontaphon said listed and non-listed companies, banks and
financial institutions with assets in excess of Bt1 billion will
have to conform to the new standards.
	   He said the new accounting standards will help boost investor
confidence, given that correct and transparent financial statements
will be produced.
	   Norawat Suwan, director-general of the Commercial Registration
Department, said the Commerce Ministry will enforce a draft bill to
set up the independent board which will be responsible for
investigating the qualifications as well as the ethics of auditors.
The board will also be authorised to revoke the licences of
auditors if wrongdoings are proven.Norawat told reporters that the
Council of State is now considering the draft bill prior to
enforcement.
	   ''We have agreed with the World Bank's proposal as we have just
around 3,000 auditors, and half of them are not efficient. The
number of auditors is not adequate for the number of companies,''
he added.
	   Nontaphon said the authorities will consider seriously the pros
and cons of the current auditing process. Law enforcement will be
also taken into consideration.
	   He told reporters the World Bank officially invited the Thai
authorities to join accounting standards-setting training
programmes in the United States and Europe.
	   ''We will be able to access first-hand information on this
matter and that will help us improve our accounting standards,''
Nontaphon said.

Japan not buying Russian fighter jets: Defense chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan does not plan to buy Russian Su-27 fighter
jets, the chairman of the Japanese Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Thursday.
	   Two Japanese pilots who have been training on the long-range
jets praised the mainstay of the Russian air force, said Adm.
Kazuya Natsukawa.
	   Natsukawa did not specify in comments reported by Russian news
agencies why Japan was not buying the planes. But he said Japan
considers such factors as past-sale services, supply of spare parts
and possible implications of such purchases on Japan's defense
industry.
	   Natsukawa is in Russia on an eight-day visit intended to boost
bilateral military cooperation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto pledged last fall to increase military contacts as part
of effort to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of a territorial dispute over four tiny
islands in the Kuril chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of
the war.

Albright sees South Asian arms race as `uniquely dangerous'
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan, India-Nuclear, Disarmament-Iran  
  By JOHN DIAMOND  
  Associated Press Writer  
  With AP Photo GEV101-102  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
Thursday rushed to join an emergency meeting of the world's
official nuclear powers, characterizes the South Asian arms race as
``uniquely dangerous.''
	   Albright, who arrived from Washington Thursday morning, said she
and the foreign ministers of Russia, China, France and Britain were
prepared to unite behind the common goal of defusing nuclear
tension on the Asian subcontinent.
	   Carrying instructions from President Clinton, Albright also was
intent on reviving the global arms control agenda sent staggering
by last month's atomic tests in India and Pakistan.
	   She met separately with the foreign ministers of China and
Russia before the joint session mainly to make the traditional
Russian tilt toward India and Chinese support for Pakistan do not
prevent the five powers from producing a strong joint statement,
U.S. officials siad.
	   The five were working on a communique that would offer mediation
services and emphasize the urgency of India's and Pakistan's
rejoining the global arms-control movement sent staggering last
month when they conducted nuclear weapons tests, said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   While nuclear weapons have been around since 1945, the actions
of Pakistan and India mark the first time that the long-time
rivals, who share a common border, have escalated their potential
for conflict to the nuclear level, Albright said.
	   ``These two countries are check-by-jowl,'' Albright told
reporters at the State Department on Wednesday shortly before
departing for Switzerland. ``So that creates a uniquely dangerous
situation.''
	   First on the agenda of the meeting at U.N. headquarters in
Geneva was reducing that tension. The U.S. delegation planned to
raise a range of proposals, from convincing India and Pakistan to
refrain from further nuclear tests to the possibility of
international mediation over the disputed Kashmir region.
	   ``Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to
cool it and take a deep breath and begin to climb out of the hole
they have dug themselves into,'' Albright said.
	   Albright met with the meeting's chairman Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and also separately with Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov early Thursday in preparation of the hastily
arranged joint session.
	   Just what leverage the five nuclear nations have to induce
Pakistan and India to cooperate was unclear going into the meeting.
	   U.S. officials were frank in acknowledging that sanctions, or
the threat of sanctions, failed to prevent India and Pakistan from
testing their weapons.
	   At the same time, the Clinton administration is no mood to offer
incentives or rewards to two countries that have thrown the arms
control and counter-proliferation agenda into disarray.
	   ``It would be highly ironic and unacceptable if we were to
provide to those who have broken the rules some benefits that do
not accrue to those who have willingly given it up,'' Albright said
in Washington.
	   She was referring to South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakstan,
Brazil and Argentina _ countries that have renounced their nuclear
weapons programs.
	   Albright laid out three goals for the five powers to pursue:
	   _Convince India and Pakistan to refrain from further testing,
from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and from further
inflammatory rhetoric.
	   _Avert a regional arms race in south Asia and ease territorial
tension over Kashmir.
	   _Convince both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and agree to a proposed treaty that would ban the production
of ``fissile materials'' _ plutonium and highly enriched uranium _
needed to make nuclear weapons.

Target of jute cultivation has not been achieved in the district

<TEXT>
this year.According to the Agriculture Extension Department (AED),
only 1,990 hectares of land were brought under Tossa jute
cultivation upto April 30 as against 23,299 hectares.
	   On the other hand, local variety of jute was cultivated on only
236 hectares against a target of 770 hectares.Early monsoon,
scarcity of jute seeds and abnormally low jute price last year are
stated to be the main causes of fall of target.Where contacted,
some jute producers said that they did not feel encouraged to grow
jute this year as they did not get even the cost of production last
year incurring heavy financial loss.
	   The farmers and jute traders laid seige to the purchasing centre
of Karnaphuly Jute Mills at Ambikapur in the town since May 19 for
realising the dues the mill authority owes to them.The authority of
the mill purchased 22667.40 quintal of jute at a cost of Taka
1,77,87,375 of which Taka 1,52,92,970 was paid and the rest Taka
24,96,205 remained unpaid.Despite repeated requests, the authority
of the mill did not clear the dues.
	   On the contrary, the authority of the mill was trying to shift
their purchasing centre elsewhere winding up their business.
Sensing the motive of the authority the farmers and jute traders
whose money is lying unpaid gheraoed the jute purchasing centre
round the clock.

U.S. official says Meles prepared to accept peace proposal
</HEADLINE>
  By ABEBE ANDUALEM  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A senior U.S. official trying to
negotiate a peaceful settlement to a border dispute between
Ethiopia and Eritrea said Thursday that Ethiopia would be prepared
to accept a joint U.S.-Rwandan proposal to defuse the conflict.
	   ``Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has indicated to me that he would
be prepared to accept the proposal after consulting his
government,'' Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Susan Rice told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said the United States was ``gravely concerned'' that neither
country had agreed on principles outlined to them for a settlement.
	   Rwanda echoed the concerns Thursday.
	   ``We are gravely concerned by the resumption of hostilities in
recent days, which will render more difficult effort to achieve a
peaceful outcome,'' the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation said in a statement issued Thursday in Kigali.
	   ``Having excellent relations with the governments of both
Eritrea and Ethiopia,'' the statement said, ``Rwanda and the United
States sought to encourage both parties to protect peace that has
taken root in the Horn of Africa since 1991.''
	   Rice, who arrived in Ethiopia last weekend for the second round
of mediation with Rwandan special envoy Patrick Mazimhaka, said she
could not say when or whether she would travel to Eritrea because
``things happen so fast.''
	   Rwandan Vice-President and Defense Minister Maj. Gen. Paul
Kagame has travelled to Addis Ababa and Asmara for talks with Meles
and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki since the conflict was first
made public May 13.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, Rubin made public for the first time
details of the agreement which calls for Eritrean withdrawal from
the border town of Badme to positions held before May 6, a complete
demilitarization of the disputed zone and the deployment of a small
observer team.
	   Eritrea, which has continued to send troops to border areas, has
insisted it is not occupying any Ethiopian territory and claims
that its troops are on Eritrean land as determined by colonial
boundaries traced by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   The U.S.-Rwandan proposal calls on both parties to ``swift and
binding'' delimitation of their border in accordance with
``established colonial treaties and internatinal law applicable to
such treaties.''
	   Eritrea accused Ethiopia of using tanks and heavy artillery in
an attack Wednesday on the frontier village of Ambesete Geleba, 140
kilometers (87 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Ethiopia of
provoking ``a new and dangerous escalation'' of the border crisis,
and said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on
Eritrean positions.
	   Hours later, Ethiopia accused Eritrean troops of attacking near
Aiga and Alitena, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) on the Ethiopian
side of a natural border formed by the Mereb River.
	   Ethiopia also claims Eritrea illegally occupies a 415-sq.
kilometer (166-sq.mile) area known as the Yirga triangle in
northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half dozen smaller areas along the
border.
	   Meles and Isaias were erstwhile allies as rebel leaders who
succeeded in ousting the 17-year military regime of Col. Mengistu
Haile Mariam from Ethiopia in July 1991.
	   Eritrea had been fighting a 30-year war for independence from
Ethiopia. Afwerki negotiated self-rule, followed by formal
independence in 1993.

UNEMPLOYED people with less than secondary education will get

<TEXT>
the chance to improve their job chances with a nine-month full-time
comprehensive basic skills program.
	   The program, to start in September, is organised by the
Employees Retraining Board (ERB) and the Vocational Training
Council (VTC).
	   It will offer 1,000 places to unemployed people who will also
receive an allowance of $4,000 per month.
	   Skills taught will cover three language, communication,
computing and business.
	   Course contents include vocational English, basic Putonghua,
basic computer techniques, bookkeeping, office skills and service
attitudes.
	   It is organised in flexible elements and on three levels: basic,
intermediate and higher.
	   Participants need not complete all three levels if they become
employed while those who are successful will receive the
VTC-validated Certificate of Skill Competence.
	   The admission criteria will be similar to the program run by the
ERB but preference might be given to those who have been unemployed
for a long time and whether they have been on social security
allowance.
	   Secretary for Manpower and Education Joseph Wong Wing-ping said
the program would help participants get a job.
	   Federation of Trade Unions chairman Cheng Yiu-tong said the new
program was acceptable only as a ``transitional arrangement'' to
help ease unemployment.
	   The Task Force on Employment yesterday also announced a doubling
of the capacity of the job-matching program in its 11 employment
services offices.
	   A telephone job-matching service will also be launched in July.

I am writing this letter to thank the Malaysian Embassy staff in

<TEXT>
Jakarta and their wives for the great hospitality they extended to
my family as well as the others who were fortunate enough to have
the embassy and unfortunate to be caught in that situation.
	   Jakarta or, for that matter, the whole of Indonesia went through
some terrible times. My family together with many other Malaysians
were caught in this quagmire.
	   It was May 16 morning that my family decided to seek help and
refuge at the embassy.
	   I did not expect that the embassy will provide the services that
were rendered to us, but more gratifying was when these were
spontaneously given. Irrespective of race or religion, everyone at
the embassy was treated fairly. This exuberence of ``Malaysian
Spirit'' was indeed most heartfelt.
	   To all the embassy staff and their wives, I would like to say
`thank you.' We do not have the privilege of knowing all your names
but all of you will surely be remembered for the help extended at a
time when we were in need.

So, UBC is what the company resulting from the merger of IBC and

<TEXT>
UTV is going to call itself. Of course, that's the least of our
concerns. It's definitely not a good sign that one of the first
announcements made by UBC was about a hike in subscription fees.
	   Guys, with the kind of programmes you've been showing of late
wealreadyfeel like we're being ripped off! Hoping to find out more
about the whole business I rang up an old contact of mine. But no
one answered the new number the lady in the marketing department
had given me. The phone rang forever. Finally a very sour operator
picked up and promptly ticked me off for not knowing the correct
number to call. When I finally got a hold of my treasured source it
turned out she was still in her old office. But they don't have an
operator there anymore. Ho hum! Well, all that run-around just so I
can inform you that, as of next month, IBC and UTV subscribers will
be getting exactly the same packages -- and I've got that on good
authority. The drama series/entertainment channels will air a
mixture of IBC and UTV programmes but IBC will be getting the
larger share. The good news for IBC subscribers like myself is that
we'll now be able to catch shows we've wanted to see for ages
without the necessity of forking out another Bt800 a month for the
privilege.
	   Definitely coming on board isMillenniumfrom Chris Carter,
creator ofThe X-Files(all the remaining shows from the current
season), plus a rerun of critics' favouriteParty of Five .
	   Also starting next month are a slate of new series:Veronica's
Closet(Kirstie Alley in the title role as a woman who owns a
lingerie company);Just Shoot Me(a sitcom where most of the action
takes place in the editorial department of a magazine; it stars
David Spade);Early Edition(not so early because it's already
allegedly been aired on Channel 7; it's about a guy who gets the
next day's paper before anybody else); andRelativity(a two-year-old
series about relationships).
	   Which is all fine and dandy. But what I want to know is why they
can't start showingSeinfeld , seasons five to nine, back to back.
The season which just ended here was number four. Are we going to
have to wait another five years before we see the finale? (Sources
says the problem is cash; that the rights to the show cost a pretty
penny. I'll say. Jerry Seinfeld was making the kind of money that
allowed him to buy an aircraft hangar full of vintage Porsches.)
Old IBC subscribers will now also be able to pick up AXN (action
movies) and Jet TV, a Japanese-language channel. Too bad UBC
couldn't get the rights to show live coverage of World Cup matches.
Oh well, it'll have to be an improvement on last year when we
missed crucial moments in several matches because they interrupted
the live coverage to run a bunch of instant-noodle ads.
	   There's not much excitement going on in the free-to-air TV
world. They seem to be keeping out of the way of World Cup mania.
	   One new programme I saw recently wasPang!(as in ''bang'', the
sound of a gunshot). Hope they don't unplug it before this column
runs. I was going to write something aboutBusaba Partytoo until I
discovered it have already been taken off the air. Apparently its
two lovely model-cum-hostesses, Pathumrat ''Helen'' Woramalee and
Methinee ''Luk Ked'' Kingpayome, were just too hot to handle. This
chat show basically involved our two models and host number three,
Siriwipa Kulthangwattana, drooling over a cute male guest. Very
un-ladylike was the feedback they kept getting, so I'm told.
	   Pang!is hosted by actor Panudate Wattanasuchart. The guests on
the one show I saw were the female celebrities who auctioned off
assets seized from the bankrupted finance companies. Panudate was
in fine form but he's going to have a tough time finding somebody
who hasn't already appeared on other talk shows.
	   It goes out on Channel 7 on Thursdays at 10.30 pm.

Romanian coach apologizes for goalkeeper's obscenities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ National soccer coach Anghel
Iordanescu apologized to fans and the media for team goalkeeper
Bogdan Stelea's obscene gestures during Wednesday's World Cup
warm-up game against Paraguay, media said Thursday.
	   Romania beat Paraguay 3-2 Wednesday evening. Stelea conceded an
easy goal from Paraguay's Roberto Acuna in the 64th minute, which
angered the Romanian fans. Only 17 minutes later he defused another
attack and received applause.
	   But that was not enough for Stelea, who pulled up his soccer
short, exposing part of his backside to the public and made obscene
gestures to the crowd.
	   ``Stelea - be ashamed!''said one headline Thursday.
	   The coach sought to calm things down a bit.
	   ``Stelea's child is hospitalized and because of this he was very
nervous,'' Iordanescu was quoted by the Libertatea daily as saying.

Court rules bank strike illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A court Thursday ruled a near month-long
strike by Ionian Bank employees was illegal, forcing strikers to
either return to work or risk putting their jobs in jeopardy.
	   The strike, staged to protest plans to privatize Greece's
fourth-largest bank, has threatened to derail government efforts to
streamline the economy and meet European Union requirements to take
part in the single currency. Ionian Bank workers walked off the job
May 8.
	   It was the second court decision declaring the strike illegal on
the grounds that workers failed to appoint a skeleton staff to
serve clients.
	   Last week, the Federation of Greek Bank Employee Unions, an
umbrella organization, backed up the strikers by declaring a
blanket walk-out at Ionian after a court ruled the strike called by
the bank's union to be illegal.
	   Presiding Judge Haralambos Birbas ordered the employees to
return to work, adding that Ionian workers' union president Ioannis
Markakis and another senior union official will be fined one
million drachmas (dlrs 3,300) for every additional strike day.
	   The court also banned Ionian workers from staging any further
strike with the same demands.
	   In the past, some strikers who ignored court orders to return to
work lost their jobs.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the union.
	   Before the latest court ruling, workers promised to continue to
the strike. They were not swayed by a government offer Tuesday to
provide current Ionian employees with a guaranteed job until the
retirement age of 62.
	   National Economy Minister Yannos Papantoniou was quoted by Greek
media saying a clause will be included in the bank's sale contract
that forbids the new owner from firing Ionian workers.
	   But Markakis replied by vowing the strike would continue until
the government revoked the sale plan altogether.

experience but haven't had the desire to actually ingest the
insidious substances that seem to be so readily available, we have
just the video for you. No need for pills and powders, just a
television and VCR. Read on for details. U-TurnStarring: Sean Penn,
Nick Nolte, Jennifer Lopez, Powers Boothe, Claire Danes, Joaquin
Phoenix, Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Voight.Directed by: Oliver
Stone.Our Take: This one will really twist your mind.
	   Not to mention make anyone who sees it think twice about
visiting small-town America. When itinerant gambler Bobby Cooper
(Sean Penn) blows a radiator hose in the Arizona desert on his way
to Las Vegas to clear an overdue debt, he trundles on in to the
town of Superior for what he expects to be a quick and easy repair
job. Ha! Is he ever in for a surprise.
	   The seemingly innocuous town is host to the oddest assortment of
characters -- and we mean ''characters'' -- ever gathered in one
place. Bobby first encounters the vampish Grace (Jennifer Lopez)
who, in her slinky red dress, just oozes sensuality, followed not
long after by a mind-jarring encounter with her nutty hubby Jake
(Nick Nolte), who tries to lure Bobby into a murder-for-moolah
scheme. Things just get weirder from there.
	   Not usually a Penn fan, we have to laud his brilliant
performance as a man just about driven round the bend as
frustration piles upon frustration. Billy Bob Thornton is a perfect
foil in his role as a whacked-out mechanic with a mindless grin
constantly tacked on his face.
	   Our biggest gripe has to do with Oliver Stone's direction --
with all the visual tics (and he tries damn hard to include every
one ever used by a director in the last 10 years), he comes off as
Quentin Tarantino trying to do David Lynch. All he succeeds in
doing is distracting from the flow of the storyline.
	   Still, for a cinematic experience unlike any you've ever seen,
this video is a must-see. Breaking UpStarring: Russell Crowe and
Salma Hayek.Directed by: Robert Greenwald.Our Take: Neil Sedaka
sang that ''Breaking Up Is Hard to Do'' -- well, so is watching
this video, and for more than one reason.
	   This video takes an uncomfortably close look at a happy couple
whose relationship gradually deteriorates until they finally
''break up'', from their last big fight to the initial separation,
subsequent reconciliation and the inevitable decision to finally
accept their differences and move on.
	   Anyone who's ever been involved in a relationship is going to
find that certain moments bite a bit close to the bone. But mostly
it's just a real snore. Russell Crowe brings to the screen none of
the powerful presence he displayed in last year's LA Confidential,
while Salma Hayek is the usual bore we've come to expect. Worse,
there's absolutely no chemistry between the two -- we spent the
entire flick wondering why they had gotten together in the first
place.
	   Ultimately depressing, Breaking Up is a film best watched only
if you're already single. The real thing is bad enough. Copyright

PLATINUM Technology Sdn Bhd expects to make more inroads into

<TEXT>
the local information technology (IT) market with its suite of
security solutions, AutoSecure.
	   This follows the appointment of Bass Consulting Sdn Bhd as its
partner to sell and support the security products and services
under its systems integration service offering.
	   According to Platinum Technology's managing director Steven Low,
the company is particularly optimistic about gaining more
penetration into the stockbroking market.
	   He said this is due to Bass Consulting's claims that it holds
about 25 per cent market share in the stockbroking back-office
systems arena.
	   Low however could not provide any expected market share figures
as the number would depend on how the stock market performs, he
said.
	   He was speaking to reporters after representing Platinum
Technology in the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU)
with Bass Consulting in Kuala Lumpur last week. Bass Consulting was
represented by its director Chan Ngow.
	   The AutoSecure suite of security solutions is designed to reduce
security risk and enable end-to-end management of enterprise-wide
security.
	   In particular, the solutions serve to address the security needs
of networks, systems, user accounts, data and applications,
specifically for hardware platforms which run Unix operating
systems .
	   The AutoSecure portfolio consists of products such as Access
Control for Unix, Single Sign On, RC/Secure, Web Security Manager,
Policy Compliance Manager, Enterprise Security Administration,
Secure Communications, Access Control for Windows NT and LANDesk
Virus Protect.
	   Access Control for Unix is a comprehensive security management
solution for distributed Unix environments that protects
information assets from unauthorised access, modification and
destruction, as well as provides streamlined, centralised security
administration.
	   RS/Secure manages database security privileges and reduces the
risk of intentional or accidental data corruption while Web
Security Manager authorises user access to intranet resources and
provides single sign-on to applications and databases.
	   According to Bass Consulting's securities division senior
manager Lum Jenn Ning, the AutoSecure suite is ideal for any
hardware user, especially in the stockbroking, insurance and
banking industries.
	   ``Although traditional systems have their own security, the
security offered by Platinum Technology's products adds another
layer of protection which is more comprehensive.
	   ``Having this additional layer is also becoming more vital
especially within today's environment of increasing utilisation of
and dependence on computer hardware, hence creating the need for
better security in the computing environment,'' said Lum.
	   He added that while the extent of computerisation in the
stockbroking arena varied between one player to another, security
is becoming more of an issue as the use of IT and the Internet
becomes more widespread.
	   ``With the Internet, information and data have become much more
global and easily accessible, thus creating many opportunities for
hackers to break into private information.''
	   Bass Consulting is also a value-added reseller for Platinum
Technology's Forest and Trees data warehousing products.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Two Indian Navy ships conducted limited exercises
with a Kuwaiti Navy vessel Thursday at the end of a four-day
goodwill visit to this small Gulf country.
	   Although limited to maneuvering and communication skills, the
games were the first between the navies of the two countries.
	   Col. Ali al-Kandari, spokesman for Kuwait's military, said the
``very limited'' exercise was carried out as the Indian ships _
destroyer INS Ranjit and patrol vessel INS Suvarna _ were leaving
the Kuwaiti waters. He said no live fire was used.

Thirty years after the shooting death of Suraphol Sombatcharoen,

<TEXT>
two of his sons will portray him in separate television specials
about his life.
	   ON August 16, 1958, the ''king'' oflook thung , Suraphol
Sombatcharoen was murdered. He was shot down in cold blood at Wat
Nong Pla Lai in Nakhon Pathom. The killer has never been found and
the motive remains a mystery to this day.
	   To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the death of the
much-loved singer, two TV specials are being screened. The first, a
Magna Pictures' production --Suraphol Khon Jing Sombatcharoen(The
Real Suraphol Sombatcharoen) -- is essentially a small-screen
biography of the man, relating his early life and the prosperous
years of his music career right up to his murder. The programme
will be aired on Channel 3 on July 4. Suraphol's 41 year-old son,
Surachai, is portraying his father.
	   The second show, Arkara Entertainment'sSip Hok Pee Haeng Khwam
Lang(16 years of memories) focuses more on Suraphol's music --
particularly his 16 years in the limelight -- and will also be
screened on Channel 3 sometime in August. This time, Surachart
Sombatcharoen, 38, will be playing his dad. On March 20, Medias
Music Group released Surachart's latest album,Suraphol 1998 , a
compilation of Suraphol songs with more upbeat backings. ''It's my
personal tribute to my father,'' he explains with a shy smile.
	   While it is recognised that Suraphol still has a loyal
following, there are concerns that what is in essence a
double-feature on the same subject but with different players
taking the lead roles, may well convey conflicting messages about
the late singer.
	   Surachai is not overly worried. ''At this point, I can't really
comment,'' he says. ''So much depends on the way the production
companies handle their respective shows. But, in principle, I have
no objection to the fact that my drama [ Khon Jing ] will be
followed bySip Hok Pee , nor the fact that my brother will be
playing our father in the second show.'' Surachart is not so happy,
particularly about the programming arrangements. ''Phi Surachai is
absolutely correct in saying that a great deal will depend on the
ability and skills of the two production teams. But I would have
preferred, as would my colleagues at Arkara Entertainment, that the
two shows be screened on different channels and with a greater
interval between them. There is already speculation that Surachai
and I have quarrelled over the way we are each intending to portray
our dad. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that we
will be supported by entirely different casts.'' ''We may be
brothers and close in age, but as tends to happen in all families,
we have marginally different views about our father. The way the
productions have been scheduled implies that we are competing with
each other.There is no conflict, but unfortunately there was a
breakdown in communication somewhere along the line. Surachai knew
that I would be starring in the [second] show early on in the
pre-production phase. I had no idea that he was filming a drama
about dad's life. When Media told me about it, the first thing I
did was contact Surachai. He told me that he had sold the concept
to Magna ages ago.'' Surachai is quick to defend his younger
brother: ''I don't think viewers should worry about these two
versions. There isn't any question of the two of us competing with
each other. Nor is is true that we have quarrelled over the
programmes. Surachart is right in saying that I had heard of plans
to filmSip Hok Pee , although I had no idea when it would be
screened. The lack of communication was unfortunate but ever since
it's been sorted out, we've seen each other almost every day. He
asks my advice on some aspects, I consult him on others. It's a
two-way thing. And I'm also very glad that he's making his mark in
the music circle.
	   Despite the unpleasant rumours and back-biting, both Surachai
and Surachart are determined to portray the realities of their
father's life on the small screen.
	   Says Surachart, ''It's important to remember that two films have
already been made about my father --Sip Hok Pee Haeng Khwam
Langwhich starred [actor] Mitr Chaibancha and [actress] Petchara
Yaowaraj starred) andSuraphol Look Phorfeaturing Banjop Jaiphra
(Charoenphorn) and Sopha Sathaphorn. Both were released in 1969.
Neither production was based on the truth, on what really happened.
The movie companies were only interested cashing in on his death.
My father's relatives were asked to star in the films which they
did. It's a coincidence that our two dramas are also coming out
back-to-back, but at least they are based on the truth.
	   ''Ah yes, the truth ...,'' adds Surachai. ''But we don't know
the truth about his murder. The case is closed; no one knows who
killed him. That's why I think it's important that we focus more on
dad's life by showing the perspectives of two 'new generation'
singers of how an upcountry lad became a famous singer.
	   ''I think a comparison can be drawn with [blockbuster Hollywood
production]Titanicand RS Film'sInsee Thong . How many people who
went to see the movie had already seen the original version
ofTitanic ? The story line was the same, the only difference was in
the casting. This time round, the producers decided that younger
actors and actresses would be more likely to draw in the crowds.
It's the same withInsee Thong , everyone knows that he dies, but
the RS version had a different ending.
	   Arkara Entertainment and Magna Pictures may have won the battle
to produce their respective versions of the biographical film, but
they were not the first to try. Three years ago, Grammy
Entertainment approached the Sombatcharoen family in an attempt to
purchase the copyright to the story.
	   ''I remember the occasion well,'' says Surachai. ''It was at the
end of May 1996. I was at Grammy at the time and had just finished
recording alook thungnumber, 'Ai Noom Phom Yao', which was my
contribution to Danu Hantrakul's albumThee Len Thee Jing .
	   ''Then reports starting appearing in the papers that I had sold
the copyright of my father's biography to Grammy. That wasn't true.
Yes, Grammy had approached me about purchasing the biography, but I
hadn't agreed to anything. There was no question at the time of my
starring in the film. While I made it clear that, if we could come
to an mutually-acceptable agreement, I didn't mind who would play
my father, I said that I would prefer it if one of my brothers or
relatives be considered. Then Grammy asked if I would be interested
in co-writing the script. My reply was that I would first want to
know who would be playing my father and the other key roles. Grammy
wasn't the first to approach me, several other companies had
expressed interest in making a film of my father's life over the
last 10 years.'' Surachart takes over the tale. ''At that time,
Grammy wanted Got [Jakkraphand Arbkhornburi] to play the leading
role. Grammy and Surachai couldn't agree, so the company [Grammy]
contacted me. We spoke for several times. Then silence.
	   ''After a few months, it dawned on me that I could play the role
myself. So I called Phi Pued [Arkara Entertainment's film director
Kitti Arkarasenee], who was looking for a popular actor who could
also sing. He called me in for a voice test and said I was suitable
for the part. I told him I hadn't sung professionally for more than
10 years, but he didn't seem to think that was important.
	   ''Unfortunately I had put on a lot of weight over the previous
four months. My youngest brother needed a kidney transplant and
when the doctors tested me, they found I was the perfect match. By
that time, I was well over 70 kilogrammes. Phi Pued ordered me to
lose weight and after a month of serious dieting, I managed to shed
eight kilos. It was too much, I felt weak and my voice was badly
affected. Phi Pued told me he no longer had the same confidence in
my abilities. We discussed the issue for the best part of a year,
then gave up. That was when I signed with MMG for a multi-album
deal.'' The two TV specials will feature several of Suraphol's best
known songs, among them ''Namta Ja Thoe'', ''Sip Hok Pee Haeng
Khwam Lang'', and ''Sao Suan Taeng''. Says Surachart, who has so
far released 11 albums on the MMG label of his father's songs, and
is currently recording a couple of full-length soundtracks for
Arkara Entertainment to coincide with the screening ofSip Hok Pee
Haeng Khwam Lang : ''I think 'Namta Ja Thoe' which dad wrote while
he was serving in the Royal Air Force, the light-hearted ''Sao Suan
Taeng'' and 'Sip Hok Pee...' fit in well with the storyline ofSip
Hok Pee Haeng Khwam Lang . But I've rejected some of his numbers,
like 'Paa Saang' and 'Mong'.
	   Surachai has been busy searching for his father's unreleased
works forKhon Jing . The two brothers are collaborating in order to
avoid duplication of sounds wherever possible, although both
acknowledge that some overlap is inevitable. They have also agreed
that their father's songs will come across with a more modern
sound.''I'll be sticking to my own style oflook thungsinging. But
they definitely won't be as modern as the numbers Surachart
recorded forSuraphol 1998 ,'' says Surachai with a laugh.
	   '' Sip Hok Peeis a period piece so there is a need to keep some
of my father's original music in order to keep his loyal fans
happy. It would be stupid to try and mimic his voice, but we can
reproduce the sound of the original scores. A member of my
father'slook thungband -- the guy that played accordion -- has
worked hard on the arrangements,'' explains Surachart.
	   Of Suraphol's five children, only Surachai and Surachart are
directly involved in the the music circle and, at present, they are
in charge of the copyright of their father's songs.
	   Although it was originally intended that the copyright of the
300 plus songs written by Suraphol would be divided equally among
the five, there have been some arguments about the split.
	   ''That agreement doesn't seem to apply anymore. I personally
feel that the copyright should be shared equally. My elder brother
does not. Surachai sent his lawyer over to the family house to talk
about the division. I sent him packing. It all seemed so sordid,''
says Surachart, the displeasure evident in his voice.
	   ''Although I haven't been in the music circle as long as
Surachai, I've recorded several of our father's songs. Surachai has
his rights and I have mine. But at least the five of us have never
really argued and fallen out over this issue.'' Surachai shrugs off
his brother's criticisms. ''I haven't given the matter that much
thought. As far as I'm concerned my father's music will eventually
belong to the nation in much the same way asphleng Thai
doem[traditional Thai music]. I'm not interested in financial
aspects of copyright. I have a good job and earn good money.''

Greece, Turkey agree to defuse tension in Aegean Sea, Solana says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Thursday that Greece and Turkey have agreed to a series of
confidence-building measures on sharing the Aegean Sea.
	   These measures are based on two memoranda of understanding,
which Greece and Turkey reached in 1988 that were never
implemented. At the time, both countries agreed to respect each
other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and their rights to
use the high seas and international airspace of the Aegean, Solana
said.
	   In a statement, Solana said that in the course of his continuing
talks with NATO members Greece and Turkey, both sides ``informed
him of their intention to implement fully the agreements reached in
1988.''
	   The 1988 agreement also called for both sides to halt military
maneuvers in the Aegean in July and August. Both Turkey and Greece
hold regular exercises in the Aegean, where they have come close to
war over territorial disputes.
	   Earlier this month, the military affairs magazine Jane's Defense
Weekly reported that Turkish and Greek officers started meeting
secretly in recent months to ease tension.

How does Power Music'sNoo Meterdefine ''Sao Mai'', a cut off his

<TEXT>
latest album,Bot Phleng Jaak Jai ?
	   ''It's basically a love song. A guy falls in love with a nurse
-- her name's Mai -- after seeing caring for patients day after day
while his sister was in the hospital. And it has a happy ending --
thanks to his sister, he'll be happy in love.'' -- Noo Meter. Now
you know! Whatever happened toThanaphand ''Mor'' Chanthrathanu 's
hair?Mor, in case you'd forgotten is a member of Stone
Entertainment's trio, New School and for the band's second album,
he's changed his hairstyle.
	   However, Mor denies that the new look has anything to do with
the prevailing belief among Thai bands that album number two will
show them up as nothing but a ''one-hit wonder''. Says Mor: ''It
has nothing to do witharthan maai lek2 [omen number 2]. If you
remember, for the first album, my head looked as though it was
soaked with blood. After that, I talked to the guys at Stone and
they agreed I could go to Khao Sarn Road to have my hair done.
Great dreadlocks.'' Teen duo Raptor has it made. Not only have the
kids released a farewell album -- they're quitting the scene so as
to concentrate on their studies -- but they've been clever enough
to pick tracks with strong hooks and catchy melodies that make for
a sure-fire sales. One of the cuts has that something indefinable
which screams ''buy me'' -- the English/Thai language ballad
''Sayonara Goodbye''.
	   As the name implies, ''Sayonara Goodbye'' is a Japanese song.
Says producerSomphorn Chokdeemeebun , ''It's a strong number and
the lyrics will go down well with young fans. I added some Thai
lyrics which were written by Moo [Suraphand Charnwichnanan]; Joni
and Louis helped me to put the line 'no more we, you and me, happy
day have gone by, no more we, memory, deep inside our heart...'.''
into English.Music Train'sSutheehas drawn praise from the critics
for what they describe as 'beautifully poetic language' on his West
Coast-inspired debut album,Dae Phuean ... Duay Phleng . A
particular favourite is ''Thanon Duang Dao''.
	   Suthee wrote the song back in '92. He was living in Chiang Mai
at the time and wanted to reflect the struggles faced by budding
musicians up there. ''There was so much ambition and need there,''
says Suthee. ''I was comparing the wish to become famous, to make
something of yourself, to a road -- a road to stardom. In many
ways, the music circle is like that. You have to keep climbing and
make sure you get round the many obstacles in the way.'' Who isThep
Por Por ? Mr Badboy will forgive you for not recognising the name
-- after all, it hasn't been penned until just recently. In fact,
it's the pseudonym Thep Phoe-Ngam, the much-loved Thai comedian has
chosen for the release of his new album,Nee Lae Phom . You can find
it in the stores on the Krabue  Co label.
	   Tracks to listen out for are ''Arokhaya'', ''Ha Khrang Lang
Aharn'', ''Khon See Kha'', ''Adeet Rak Sao Khem''. Dance fans
should fast forward to ''Ja Ba Rue Mao'', ''Por Tek Tueng' and
'Phaeng Phaeng''.
	   And, just in case you were pondering the origins of Thep's new
name, ''Por por'' is an abbreviation ofplien plaeng , which means
''change''.

AMNESTY International has called on the Central Government to

<TEXT>
reassess the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy crackdown and to
release prisoners of conscience.
	   The London-based human rights group made the call yesterday on
the eve of the ninth anniversary of the June 4 incident.
	   Amnesty said the time was ripe for Beijing to re-evaluate the
event following the smooth transition from the Deng Xiaoping era
and the smooth handover of Hong Kong.
	   The organisation said it had documented at least 250 cases of
people still in prison for their participation in the 1989
pro-democracy movement.
	   It said the real figures could be much higher.
	   Amnesty also urged Beijing to release prisoners serving
sentences for ``counter-revolutionary'' offences that had been
abolished last year.
	   It believed most of the cases were a miscarriage of justice
because many had not received a fair trial and had been tortured to
confess their ``crimes''.
	   The organisation also called on other governments to keep
pressing Beijing to grant amnesty to all prisoners of conscience.
	   Amnesty spotlighted the cases of three dissidents _ Chen Lantao,
Wang Jiaxiang and Yao Guisheng.
	   Chen is serving a 13-year sentence province for criticising the
government's suppression of demonstrators.
	   Wang, 75, is a prisoner of conscience serving a life sentence
for ``counter-revolutionary sabotage''.
	   Yao is serving a 15-year sentence for ``looting''.

LOCAL courier company City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd is embarking

<TEXT>
on a computerisation project to tackle the Year 2000 (Y2K) or
millennium bug problem within its work environment.
	   The project, which is estimated to cost at least RM1 million,
will be geared towards ensuring that all computerised systems at
the company's 50 branch offices nationwide are Y2K-compliant before
the year 2000.
	   According to City-Link's director and group general manager
Chris Tan, the Y2K initiative will largely focus on the company's
larger branches, totalling 12, which are targeted to achieve full
compliancy by year-end.
	   He said the company, through its information technology (IT)
division, has already started to work on the project, which is
critical to ensure that its operations will not be affected by the
Y2K problem.
	   ``Basically we are looking at replacing the personal computers
(PCs) at these branches, which comprises a mix of 486-, Pentium
75-, Pentium 100-based machines running the Novell network
operating system, with Pentium II computers,'' Tan said.
	   ``We also feel that it will be more cost-justifiable to switch
to a Unix operating environment as the host system servers at the
headquarters are also Unix-based. Thus, we are also thinking of
deploying the SCO operating system on the new machines,'' he told
Computimes in Shah Alam on Tuesday.
	   Apart from the PCs and other hardware equipment, Tan said the
investment will also cater for software applications designed to
render the entire system Y2K-compliant.
	   He added that the host systems at City-Link's headquarters, a
Supermax/24 and an HP9000 D270/2 machines which were installed in
1993 and 1997 respectively, are already Y2K-compliant. As such they
are not subject to the computerisation exercise.
	   City-Link's information technology manager Randy Ong said the
decision to deploy new and more powerful PCs at the branches is in
line with the company's plans to link all the offices with the Shah
Alam headquarters.
	   He said the project, which will involve an additional investment
of approximately RM500,000, will serve to put in place more
effective communications linkages to enhance services for its
customers, which now are in the region of 30,000.
	   ``We hope to have a full-fledge communications link-up between
the headquarters and branch offices by the year 2000. Under this
project, we will only put total communications systems at the
larger branches while exploring the Internet as a prevailing
network tool to link up the smaller ones,'' he said.
	   City-Link has to date invested RM5 million in its IT-related
projects, which started in 1993. The investments went into
providing, among others, direct or online linkages to major
customers, prompt delivery, and a ``one- stop'' customer enquiry
centre.
	   Apart from its network of 50 branches, the company also has two
airport offices including one at the newly-built Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang, and 50 express centres throughout
Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak. Its RM13 million new
headquarters in Shah Alam, Wisma City-Link is scheduled to be
officially open today by Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Minister Datuk Leo Moggie.

  Eds: Contains items on Zimbabwe, Seychelles, South Africa, Ghana  
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's maize millers gave notice
Thursday they can no longer hold down prices of meal as urged by
President Robert Mugabe's government after food-price increases
triggered riots which claimed eight lives.
	   Maize meal is the staple diet of Zimbabwe's 12.6 million people.
	   The Millers' Association, representing large and often
white-owned companies, and the Small-Scale Millers Association,
representing emergent black enterprises, published advertizements
warning they would have to increase prices of meal by 15-18 percent
``as stocks purchased at the previous price run out.''
	   The government could invoke emergency powers to ban a retail
price increase but the millers warn this would inevitably lead to
``losses and food shortages.''
	   ------
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ A midnight blast partially destroyed
a controversial monument to those who carried out the June 5, 1977,
coup a year after Seychelles gained independence from Britain.
	   The blast just before midnight Wednesday came on the eve of
Seychelles annual June 5 celebrations in honor of the coup led by
then radical labor lawyer, now President France-Albert Rene.
	   The celebrations have always included a wreath-laying ceremony
at the foot of the large metal sculpture of a man breaking his
chains, known in local creola as `zonm lib' or free man.
	   The blast is the fourth in a month in the Seychelles capital
Victoria, located on Mahe, the largest island in the Indian Ocean
archipelago. No one has taken responsibility for any of the
explosions, which caused no injuries.
	   ------
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Nigeria has sent a special envoy to Ghana
for consultations with President Jerry Rawlings, news reports said
Thursday.
	   National Security Advisor Ismaila Gwarzo arrived in Ghana late
Wednesday with a message from Gen. Sani Abacha to Rawlings, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
	   The contents of the message were not disclosed, but it was
believed to be
	   connected to Abacha's allegations earlier this week that Ghana,
South Africa
	   and the United States were plotting to disrupt forthcoming
presidential elections in Nigeria.
	   Officials of those countries allegedly met in Accra, Ghana's
capital.
	   All three countries denied the accusation. Ghana promised to
investigate the matter.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The National Union of
Mineworkers on Thursday said it is at loggerheads with diamond
giant De Beers over salary increases and improvement of employment
conditions.
	   De Beers spokeswoman Judith Annakie said she hoped
representatives of the two bodies would meet soon to break the
impasse and restart the wage negotiations.
	   Union spokesman George Molebatsi said the union was demanding a
12 percent increase while the company was offering only 3 percent,
which NUM said fell far below the inflation rate.
	   The union accused De Beers of reneging on a two-year agreement
signed last year which stipulated that salaries would be increased
in line with the official year-on-year consumer price index
published by the Central Statistical Services from May.
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A retired police general said
Thursday he was dismayed upon learning in June 1988 that black
activist Stanza Bopape had died under police torture.
	   ``I was shocked and upset when I heard that his death was caused
by electrical shocks,'' Petrus du Toit told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in Pretoria.
	   Du Toit, at the time a colonel in the security police, and nine
other policemen have applied for amnesty for offenses arising from
Bopape's death in Johannesburg on June 12, 1988.
	   Police concealed Bopape's death by saying he had escaped. His
body was dumped into the crocodile-infested Komati River between
South Africa and Mozambique.

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Former European lightweight boxing
champion Rene Weller of Germany has been arrested and jailed for
allegedly selling of 600 grams of cocaine, police said Thursday.
	   Weller, the European lightweight champion from 1984-85 and again
for a short time in 1988, was arrested along with four other
suspects on charges of illegal drug sales in Karlsruhe, 150
kilometers (90 miles) south of Frankfurt, and in Aachen on the
Dutch border, police said.
	   The 44-year-old Weller has often had brushes with the law and
has been fined in the past for receiving stolen property and fraud.
	   He faces up to four years in jail if convicted of drug dealing.

EU approves dlrs 1.7 million in aid for Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Thursday cleared
humanitarian aid worth dlrs 1.7 million for Yemen, which is still
suffering from a devastating 1994 civil war.
	   The funds will help provide basic aid to Somalian and Erythrean
refugees fleeing unrest in their own countries, and to Yemenis
returning from Somalia, an EU statement said.
	   Most of Yemen's 17 million people live in poverty and the
country cannot cope on its own with the arrival of refugees from
neighboring countries.
	   The money will be channeled through aid organizations to provide
refugee camps with water supplies and sanitation facilities, and to
distribute medical aid among Yemenis, the statement said.
	   Previous EU humanitarian aid to Yemen since 1993 amount to dlrs
1.8 million, the statement said.

UNIVERSITY of Hong Kong Vice-Chancellor Cheng Yiu-chung

<TEXT>
yesterday turned a blind eye to the repainting of a June 4 slogan
on the bridge outside the Swire Building.
	   Professor Cheng also received a petition from 20 students
demanding a decision from the administration on the fate of the
slogan painted in 1989.
	   The 20-character slogan reads: ``Spirit of the heroes in the
massacre will last forever, democracy will never die.'' Students'
Union president Tang Chui-chung said a row had been brewing since
1996 when Prof Cheng said the University Council would consider
whether to keep the slogan or not.
	   Mr Tang said 90 per cent of the 3,300 students and staff had
voted to keep the slogan in a poll conducted last October.
	   Mr Tang urged Prof Cheng to respect the decision and to ensure
it was supported by the decision-making body.
	   Prof Cheng promised the slogan would not be erased until a final
decision was made _ after the summer vacation in September at the
latest.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of people were expected to attend a
candlelight vigil tonight in Victoria Park as Hong Kong marked the
ninth anniversary of the crackdown on the mainland pro-democracy
movement for the first time under Beijing rule.
	   The rally has been held every year since the crackdown.
	   Organisers forecast a strong turnout for the vigil.
	   Last year, 55,000 people turned out just weeks before the
handover amidst increasing uncertainty for the future.
	   This year the tone is expected to be slightly different, with
greater optimism for democracy and human rights.
	   Members of the Citizens Party will donate blood at noon today to
commemorate the anniversary.
	   The Hong Kong Federation of Students will hold a march in which
two team of students will proceed from the Polytechnic University
in Hung Hom and the University of Hong Kong in Pok Fu Lam Road to
Victoria Park to join the candlelight vigil.
	   The Frontier will also march from Tin Hau MTR station in
Causeway Bay to join the ritual.
	   A seminar will be held before the vigil on the prospect of a
democratic movement developing in the mainland.
	   The seminar, organised by the Alliance in Support of Patriotic
Democratic Movements in China, will start in the park at 5pm.
	   Academics said protesters were conscious of the significance of
holding a mass rally in Hong Kong for the first time since the
handover.
	   ``This is the first time an open rally on the Tiananmen Square
incident has been held within China,'' Professor Joseph Cheng
Yu-shek of the City University said.
	   ``There is a feeling of satisfaction and a feeling of hope for a
move towards gradual democracy in China,'' said Prof Cheng, who is
director of the university's Contemporary China Research Centre.
	   About 2,700 banner-waving protesters turned out for a Tiananmen
Square memorial march last Sunday to the offices of Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Observers said the march had provided a further boost to public
confidence.

I was surprised and perplexed to learn that the Thai foreign

<TEXT>
minister would meet the ambassadors of India and Pakistan over the
nuclear issue, although I applaud the efforts. Isn't this unusual
for the Asean's normal practice of non-interference with other
countries, for example, Burma and Cambodia? What is this new spin?
Is Thailand planning to enter the big league? If so, then push
human rights with your neighbours first. Don't use the Asean mantra
one day and do something opposite the next day, or you may wind up
smelling like the US two-faced policy.

About 100 acres of lands of the Bangladesh Railway in the

district have been grabbed illegally by some influential persons.
	   According to Railway sources, the lands situated on both sides
of 30 kilometre long railway line, have been grabbed through fake
documents.The illegal occupants are earning huge sums of money by
selling these lands to the people depriving the government.Pucca
and semi-pucca buildings have been construced on these lands.
	   It is learnt that some influential people took possession of the
lands illegally through fake registrations in connivance with a
section of dishonest railway officials.Local lawyers said, if the
age-old laws are not changed it would be difficult for the Railway
authority to recover its lands.

THE Education Department's policy of enlarging primary one

<TEXT>
classes in the 1998-99 academic year has come under attack from
educators.
	   Under the new policy, to be implemented in September, two extra
students will be added to each Primary One class.
	   The policy aims to speed up the pace of implementing whole-day
primary schooling as espoused by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa in
his policy address.
	   Director of Education Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping explained that the
original plan of reducing the class size was scrapped because of
the lack of sites for new schools.
	   ``I felt angry after hearing the announcement,'' said
legislator-elect Cheung Man-kwong of the Professional Teachers'
Union, who assailed the Education Department for ``not listening to
teachers and headmasters''.
	   Mr Cheung said PTU and six other education bodies would continue
their signature campaign against the plan among primary and
secondary school teachers and headmasters. The union has already
collected 20,800 signatures.
	   Mr Cheung, a Democrat, said he would raise the issue in the new
Legislative Council.
	   Lau Chi-keung, a member of the Subsidised Primary Schools
Council, echoed Mr Cheung's views.
	   ``It is unfair to students who are studying in half-day primary
schools. Why did they not put more resources to all primary schools
instead?'' Mr Lau said.
	   He said the plan would run counter to the Chief Executive's
policy of raising the quality of education.
	   Under the plan, the number of students per class in primary
schools with traditional curriculum will be raised from 35 to 37.
	   Target-oriented curriculum classes will have 32 instead of the
original 30.

I refer to the promotional campaign for potato chips which

<TEXT>
depicts Adolf Hitler. The commercial is supposedly intended to
attract teenagers but it shows a great deal of ignorance of
history, especially the dramatic part of World War II. Is the ad
intended to make viewers forget the suffering of millions of people
killed at that time?
	   I notice that in Asia there is some sort of neutral acceptance
(lack of historical knowledge?) of many fascist symbols that are
simply unacceptable in Europe. For example, many motorcycle riders
in Bangkok wear Nazi helmets, with a swastika.
	   I think the advertising company should stop this campaign
immediately. Otherwise, soon in Asia somebody will start promoting
snacks with the image of Pol Pot.

Khomeini's grandson calls for unity, praises Khatami
</HEADLINE>
  RETRANSMITTING to ADD cycle designator  
  By EARLEEN FISHER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With the rift widening between supporters
and foes of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, the grandson of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Iranians toward unity Thursday on
the anniversary of the revolutionary patriarch's death.
	   ``Today Khatami is the man who is providing the best assistance
for the thoughts of Imam Khomeini and the current leadership of the
country,'' Hassan Khomeini said. ``Khatami is establishing the
pillars of the thinking of the Imam in the society.''
	   The young Khomeini spoke to a huge crowd at the late cleric's
gold-domed shrine outside Tehran during a ceremony marking the
ninth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death.
	   Like President Khatami, Hassan Khomeini is a mid-level cleric.
Both wear black turbans identifying them as direct descendants of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ an important sign of political and
religious prestige in this overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim nation.
	   Hassan Khomeini, thought to be in his mid-20s, also invoked a
familiar theme of the Islamic revolution that toppled the
pro-American Shah in 1979 and installed a fundamentalist
government:
	   ``Whoever talks about relations with the U.S. government ... is
far from the thinking of the Imam (Ayatollah Khomeini).''
	   Invoking the words of his late grandfather, Hassan Khomeini said
midway through his 40-minute speech: ``Relations with the United
States are as (impossible as) relations between the wolf and the
lamb.''
	   That brought the crowd to its feet in the Iranian revolution's
battle cry of ``death to America.''
	   Khatami, a relative moderate who was elected president a year
ago in a landslide victory over hard-liners, has advocated dialogue
between the Iranian and American peoples _ but not their
governments. Khatami attended Thursday's ceremony but did not
speak.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the late Khomeini's successor as Iran's
supreme spiritual and political leader, addressed the crowd in an
unusually quiet voice and spoke for less than 15 minutes.
	   Vehemently anti-American but less outspoken on the subject since
Khatami's election, Khamenei praised Iran's youth as the hope of
the Islamic revolution and called the United States and Israel
``the defeated enemies of Islam.''
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
death, Khamenei has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``My friends and doctors would not allow me to talk longer than
this,'' the 58-year-old Khamenei said.
	   Journalists who regularly cover Khamenei said he had a bad cold
but the ailment was not serious.
	   The crowd appeared to number in the tens of thousands, not the
hundreds of thousands that came in previous years.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - In response to complaints on bus services,

<TEXT>
the Government will build transit malls for buses and 1,200 bus
stops to improve access to the city's public transport services.
	   Deputy Entrepreneur Development Minister, Datuk Idris Jusoh said
transit malls for buses would be built at several locations in the
city, including Jalan Tun Perak and Jalan Cheng Lock.
	   A transit mall is an area where a road is closed to all traffic
except buses. One has already been built in Jalan Dang Wangi,
between Sogo Shopping Complex and Pertama Shopping Complex.
	   Idris said work on the transit malls would begin after the 1998
Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, which will be held between Sept 11
and 21. He added that this would involve road diversions and the
re-routing of buses.
	   Speaking to reporters after launching the Seni Rasa Collection
at a hotel today, Idris said City Hall would also build 1,200 bus
stops to improve public transportation. However, he did not say
when work would begin.
	   Idris described the outcome of weekly meetings held between the
Ministry and representatives from the bus companies over the past
month as good. He said representatives from the Federation of
Malaysian Consumers Associations, the Transport Workers Union and
City Hall had also been present at some of the meetings which he
had chaired.
	   He said in some areas, Intrakota and Park May had increased the
frequency and number of buses plying the route.
	   ``For example, along the Bangsar route, Intrakota has increased
the number of buses from five to seven and is willing to increase
it to eight if the demand increases,'' he said.
	   In Bandar Sri Damansara, he added, Park May has begun plying the
route which had no service previously. On May 5, it was reported
that the Ministry would hold weekly meetings with representatives
of Intrakota and Park May to find ways to improve their services.
	   This was following numerous complaints on poor bus services. One
of them was in March 19, when TWU general secretary Zainal Rampak
had called on the Ministry to review the bus service in the Klang
Valley.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In their first such ceremony under Chinese
rule, tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered despite in
heavy rain Thursday to mourn the victims of the Tiananmen Square
massacre nine years ago.
	   Even though Beijing has kept hands off of Hong Kong since
reassuming sovereignty last July 1, those who came to the
candlelight vigil said it was important to remember the students
who died, and to ensure that their own rights don't erode.
	   There was no police interference as about 40,000 people
converged at downtown Victoria Park. Beijing kept a close watch for
protests on the mainland, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the
Chinese government was not concerned about the Hong Kong protest.
	   The gathering was held against a backdrop proclaiming, ``Reverse
the June 4 verdict,'' a reference to Beijing's condemnation of the
1989 student movement as counter-revolutionary and subversive.
	   Wang Dan, a leader of the protest that was crushed by the army,
told the crowd that he was ``touched'' by the large turnout. He was
speaking by telephone hookup from the United States, where he was
sent after his release from a Chinese prison in April.
	   Hong Kong ``plays an important role in pushing ahead democratic
development in China. Hong Kong people must insist on organizing
this kind of (pro-democracy) activities,'' he said.
	   Wei Jiangsheng, another prominent dissident on exile in the
United States, said through a pre-recorded videotape that China
``has come to a stage that (it) can no longer resist the demand for
democratic reforms.''
	   ``The democratic developments in Hong Kong and in Taiwan have
shown the world that (Chinese) are capable of pushing forth
democratic reforms,'' said Wei.
	   Wei had spent virtually every day since 1979 in prison for his
pro-democracy work in China until his release last November.
	   The crowd sang songs from the 1989 student movement. Placards
placed in the park proclaimed: ``Fight to the end.'' A fire was lit
on stage.
	   Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party that is pushing for
more democracy in Hong Kong, said he was pleased with the turnout,
and found the Foreign Ministry statement ``much more positive''
than previous ones.
	   ``I never thought the rain could dampen the flame of the Hong
Kong people,'' he said.
	   High school math teacher Fung Tak Wah, 40, said it was the ninth
time he took part in Hong Kong's Tiananmen vigil.
	   ``I was sad to see the students being killed, not only because I
am a teacher or because I am Chinese, but because I am human,
too,'' he said.
	   Anthony Hung, a 19-year-old student, said Hong Kong residents
must guard their rights.
	   ``If we don't stand up and defend our rights, the Chinese
government may take it away someday, before we know it,'' he said.
	   However, it was clear that Hong Kong generally was less worried
about its return to Chinese rule than it was last June 4, less than
a month before the handover that ended more than 140 years of
British rule. About 55,000 people turned out for last year's rally.
	   Although there are some worries about erosion of the rule of law
in Hong Kong, Beijing generally is regarded as having kept its
pledge to allow Hong Kong to keep its own system and run its own
affairs.
	   Instead, Hong Kong's chief concern is its faltering economy,
which is sliding into recession.

MOST Hong Kong people agree that schools should raise the

national flag on important dates to encourage national pride among
young people, a survey has found.
	   The survey was conducted on behalf of Commercial Radio by the
Social Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong and
interviewed 510 people.
	   It found 68 per cent believed raising the Chinese flag on
National Day, the handover anniversary and in school graduation
rites would strengthen the students' sense of nationhood.
	   Only 7 per cent disagreed.
	   About 70 per cent regarded the display of the national flag as
the best way to propagate a sense of belonging to one nation among
youth.
	   The singing of the national anthem appealed to 67 per cent of
respondents while serving the people was endorsed by 64 per cent.
	   Only 17 per cent agreed that displaying photographs of national
leaders was the best way to demonstrate a sense of nationhood.

Viravaidya's plan to set up a watchdog company to monitor
SET-listed companies and expose possible abuses of corporate
ethics. I agree with him whole-heartedly and would like to know
where to mail my checks to subscribe to the company's shares. Could
you advise?
	   Also, I fully support his request for the media to report on the
lifestyle of former executives of the failed banks and finance
companies. We all know too well that these people will not be
punished legally because of the inefficiency of the Bank of
Thailand in collecting evidence against them and of our justice
system in delivering timely justice. It is the media's job to
discover how these guys are better off after destroying our
country, and it is the Thai people's job to socially punish them.
	   I would like to propose that newspapers and TV stations play up
this issue (the continued luxurious lifestyle of the former
executives) to attract more public attention, and I will give them
Bt20,000 of my hard-earned salary with my full blessing.

Air France strike enters fourth day; job actions widen

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Paris subway drivers and railway workers in
southern France staged strikes Thursday, intensifying a transport
snarl for World Cup visitors already frustrated with walkouts by
Air France pilots and baggage handlers.
	   The rash of strikes, with more threatened in the coming days,
was causing embarrassment and anger among French officials and
common citizens worried the job actions will damage not only the
soccer championship but the national image.
	   ``It's typically French, raising hell like that, and they pick
just the right time to do it,'' said Christophe Monot, a shirt shop
salesman.
	   ``It's unacceptable. It doesn't make us look good,'' said Yvette
Goupil, shaking her head as she sliced bread in her bakery.
	   Leading conservative lawmaker Philippe Seguin said the strike
risked making France ``the laughing stock of the entire world.''
	   Six days before the World Cup begins, most of Air France's 3,200
pilots remained off the job to protest cuts in their salaries,
among the world's highest. But with public opinion against them,
the pilots appeared to soften their stand.
	   A third round of talks in the pilots' pay dispute was scheduled
Thursday evening at Air France, and a spokesman for the leading
union SNPL said things looked ``more optimistic than the day before
yesterday.''
	   Spokesman Christian Paris told RTL radio, but he predicted
``significant advances'' in the talks slated for 6:30 p.m. (1630
GMT).
	   But France's labor troubles widened Thursday, when one Paris
subway workers' union staged a partial strike. Rail workers were
striking in the Provence-Riviera region until Friday, and the
Communist-led CGT union organized protest marches in Paris.
	   Other pay disputes threatened to paralyze trains this weekend,
and airline mechanics chimed in with plans for their own walkout.
	   A nightmare for passengers, an indefinite strike by baggage
handlers at Charles de Gaulle Airport continued for a third day
Thursday, the airport authority said.
	   ``I think it's hilarious,'' said American Amanda Adams, 23, from
Minneapolis, Minnesota, sipping wine in a sidewalk cafe. ``They
mess everything up to show how important they are,'' said her
hometown friend Sally Schmeising, 21.
	   The Air France strike was the biggest test for the leftist
government of Lionel Jospin since a trucker strike late last year.
France has periodically paralyzed by transport strikes, most
recently the one in late 1995 that was seen as the worst since May
1968.
	   But Jospin was standing firm.
	   The airline ``has the full support of the government,'' the
Socialist finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told the
National Assembly.
	   Commenting for the first time on the strike, President Jacques
Chirac on Wednesday night called on both sides to ``show proof of
their responsibility'' in the dispute as France prepares to become
``the host country of the planet.''
	   But CGT chief Louis Viannet said the World Cup didn't mean
unions would call a truce. ``The World Cup is one thing, but the
fact it exists doesn't do away with the problems, he told Radio
Monte Carlo.
	   Despite the strike, Air France has guaranteed travel throughout
the tournament for all participating teams.
	   Air France said it maintained a Thursday schedule of 17 percent
of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of its short and
medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40
percent from Orly.
	   The company wants to give its pilots stock in exchange for 500
million francs (dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - A woman is baffled over the disappearance

<TEXT>
of her moneylender husband after he had gone to collect a RM47,000
debt in Johor Baru, in March, this year.
	   What has intrigued housewife Ling Shih Ching, 29, is that the
Honda Accord which her husband drove on the day of his
disappearance, was found abandoned at the Kulai-Kota Tinggi trunk
road three days later.
	   On March 16, Tai Kin Chan, 30, left home after informing Ling
that he was going to collect about RM47,000 from a borrower.
	   Ling said that it was the last time that she saw her husband,
adding that he was a licensed moneylender.
	   ``The next day, when several attempts to trace my husband drew a
blank, I lodged a police report at the Johor Baru police
headquarters.
	   ``Two days later, I was shocked when his car, with the key
intact in the ignition, was found abandoned at the Kulai-Kota
Tinggi trunk road, with the vehicle's doors unlocked,'' she added.
	   Ling was speaking to reporters at the MCA Public Services and
Complaints Bureau at Wisma MCA today.
	   In an unrelated case, the families of three teenagers have
appealed for public assistance to locate their whereabouts as they
had gone missing over the last week.
	   Tan Ai Nee, 16, and Lim Hooi Cheng, 15, who were reported
missing on May 28, and Ai Nee's cousin, Lim Fong Yuen, 18, who
disappeared two days later, are known to one another.
	   Hooi Cheng was staying at Ai Nee's house in Jalan Sungai Besi
before the latter's mother, Tan Ah Kek, 43, found both teenagers
missing.
	   On May 30, Fong Yuen, of Kulai, Johor, who told her family she
was going for a movie with a classmate, failed to return home.
	   ``We have searched everywhere for the three girls but to no
avail,'' said Fong Yuen's mother, Tan Kim Nyak, 48.
	   Chong advised those knowing their whereabouts to contact the
nearest police station or the bureau hotline at tel: 03-2632305.

Bulgaria returns palaces and villas to exiled king

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's exiled king Simeon II will get
back the real estate of his ancestors which communists nationalized
51 years ago, a high court ruled Thursday.
	   Simeon, 61, now a businessman living in Madrid, Spain, was
restored ownership over two palaces, three hunting villas and two
country houses which the communist government confiscated in 1947,
a year after it abolished monarchy and exiled the royal family.
	   At a closed meeting, the 12-judge Constitutional Court, which is
empowered to review legislation, threw out a law about royal
property nationalization on a motion by Prosecutor General Ivan
Tatarchev.
	   ``There is at last rule of law in Bulgaria,'' said Princess
Maria Louisa, Simeon's sister, who is here visiting her homeland.
	   Restored property includes the palaces Vranya, in a Sofia suburb
of the same name, and Czarska Bistritsa on Rila mountain, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Sofia.
	   It also includes three hunting villas in Rila and two farm
houses near the city of Plovdiv, some 160 kilometers (100 miles)
east of Sofia.
	   All places have served as government mansions.
	   Simeon acceded to the throne at the age of 6 in 1943, when his
father Boris III died shortly after allying Bulgaria with Nazi
Germany.
	   He reigned under regencies until 1946, when communists, whom the
Soviet army installed in 1944, abolished monarchy in a referednum
widely suspected of being rigged.
	   Simeon enjoyed a tumultuous welcome by enthusiastic crowds
during two brief returns to his homeland in 1996 and 1997.

  RETRANSMITTING to restore BC designator

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With the rift widening between supporters
and foes of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, the grandson of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Iranians toward unity Thursday on
the anniversary of the revolutionary patriarch's death.
	   ``Today Khatami is the man who is providing the best assistance
for the thoughts of Imam Khomeini and the current leadership of the
country,'' Hassan Khomeini said. ``Khatami is establishing the
pillars of the thinking of the Imam in the society.''
	   The young Khomeini spoke to a huge crowd at the late Imam's
gold-domed shrine outside Tehran during a ceremony marking the
ninth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's death.
	   Like President Khatami, Hassan Khomeini is a hojatoleslam, or
mid-level cleric. Both wear black turbans identifying them as
direct descendants of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ an important sign
of political and religious prestige in this overwhelmingly Shiite
Muslim nation.
	   Hassan Khomeini, thought to be in his mid-20s, also invoked a
familiar theme of the Islamic revolution that toppled the
pro-American Shah in 1979 and installed a fundamentalist
government:
	   ``Whoever talks about relations with the U.S. government ... is
far from the thinking of the Imam (Ayatollah Khomeini).''
	   Invoking the words of his late grandfather, Hassan Khomeini said
midway through his 40-minute speech: ``Relations with the United
States are as (impossible as) relations between the wolf and the
lamb.''
	   That brought the crowd to its feet in the Iranian revolution's
battle cry of ``marg bar Amrika'' _ ``death to America.''
	   Khatami, a relative moderate who was elected president a year
ago in a landslide victory over hardliners, has advocated dialogue
between the Iranian and American peoples _ but not their
governments. Khatami attended Thursday's ceremony but did not
speak.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the late Khomeini's successor as Iran's
supreme spiritual and political leader, addressed the crowd in an
unusually quiet voice and spoke for less than 15 minutes.
	   Vehemently anti-American but less outspoken on the subject since
Khatami's election, Khamenei praised Iran's youth as the hope of
the Islamic revolution and called the United States and Israel
``the defeated enemies of Islam.''
	   In previous speeches on the anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's
death, Khamenei has spoken emotionally for nearly an hour.
	   ``My friends and doctors would not allow me to talk longer than
this,'' the 58-year-old Khamenei said.
	   Journalists who cover Khamenei on a daily basis said he had a
bad cold but the ailment was not serious.
	   The crowd appeared to number in the tens of thousands, not the
hundreds of thousands that came in previous years.
	   Thursday's turnout was about the same size as the one at a rally
in Tehran on May 23, the first anniversary of Khatami's election.
	   But there was an important difference: The demonstrators who at
Khatami's rally were almost all Tehran residents, many university
students.
	   The throng at the Khomeini shrine, only 20 kilometers (12 miles)
south of Tehran _ while including many people from the capital _
was swelled by contingents bussed from faraway cities and
provinces.
	   The crowd _ mostly men, carefully segregated from the women in
all-enveloping black chadors _ surged forward during Hassan
Khomeini's speech and when Khamenei appeared. They were held back
by steel-bar fences and Revolutionary Guards.
	   Every few minutes, young men and boys fainted in the 32-degree
centigrade (90-degree Fahrenheit) heat. Their inert bodies were
passed by hands over the heads of the crowd until they could be
lowered onto the stretchers.
	   Among the first to faint was Mehdi Hosseini, a 15-year-old
Tehran schoolboy, who regained consciousness after being fanned
with a poster bearing the image of Ayatollah Khomeini.
	   ``I've been coming here for several years,'' the teen-ager said.
``I arrived last night and started praying, eating only one
sandwich.
	   ``I'm here because Khomeini was a great man who changed
history.''

Romanian coach apologizes for goalkeeper's obscenities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ National soccer coach Anghel
Iordanescu apologized to fans and the media for team goalkeeper
Bogdan Stelea's obscene gestures during Wednesday's World Cup
warm-up game against Paraguay, reports said Thursday.
	   Romania beat Paraguay 3-2 Wednesday evening. Stelea conceded an
easy goal from Paraguay's Roberto Acuna in the 64th minute,
angering Romanian fans. Only 17 minutes later he defused another
attack and received applause.
	   But that wasn't enough for Stelea. He pulled up his soccer
shorts, exposing part of his backside to the public, and made
obscene gestures to the crowd.
	   ``Stelea - be ashamed!''said one headline Thursday.
	   The coach sought to calm the furor.
	   ``Stelea's child is hospitalized and because of this he was very
nervous,'' Iordanescu was quoted by the Libertatea daily as saying.

ALMOST two thirds of parents had paid some forms of ''tea

<TEXT>
money'' to schools or colleges in return for guaranteed admissions
for their children, according to an opinion survey.
	   The poll, conducted by Rajabhat Institute Suan Dusit on 5,671
people nationwide between May 4 and June 2, found that 66.6 per
cent said they had paid favours of one sort or another to ensure
their children were admitted to schools or colleges.
	   Ironically, 74.97 per cent of the 66.6 per cent said they paid
colleges, in particular Rajabhat Institute. Parents said they paid
schools or colleges anything from Bt200,000 to vans.
	   CCC to investigate projects THE Counter Corruption Commission
(CCC) is looking into alleged irregularities involving the
Royal-initiated reservoir construction projects in the northeastern
provinces, CCC secretary-general Klanarong Chantik said Wednesday.
	   CCC officials were tipped off by military personnel from the
Internal Security Operation Command that officials from the Royal
Irrigation Department had exploited insider information by telling
their friends to buy plots of land which will be flooded by the
reservoirs since they could seek huge state compensation in return,
Klanarong said.
	   The opportunists would buy the land from villagers cheaply
because they duped the locals into believing the land would be
expropriated. After taking ownership, the opportunists would grow
trees on the land since they would be compensated for up to Bt1,800
for each tree which suffered from flooding or was cut down for the
reservoirs' construction.
	   Chief calls for fairness WISUT Suwannasuthi, transferred to an
inactive post from his position as Scientific Crime Detection
Division chief, Wednesday called for fairness for himself and his
subordinates who were suspended from the service for alleged
corruption.
	   Wisut said he could guarantee all of the division's work had
long been carried out in a transparent manner and underwent
thorough inspections by senior officers.Police officers suspended
FIVE police officers at the Metropolitan Police Bureau who have
been accused of switching suspects' fingerprints were Wednesday
temporarily dismissed pending further investigation.
	   They are Pol Capt Phathoon Phumjaroen of Bang Chan station, Pol
Sgt Maj Nopphol Chinchai of Chok Chai station, Pol Sgt Maj Yongyuth
Jan-art and Pol Sgt Sitthichoke Watthanawisut of Bang Na station,
and Pol Sgt Maj Banjerd Sone-oop of Bang Phongphang station.
	   The five were initially found ruled guilty of switching
suspects' fingerprints in petty crimes so their criminal records
would be deleted from their stations' database, in return for
money.
	   More Microbus routes soonBANGKOK residents will have more ways
of getting around the city as Thonburi Motors Assembly Co (TMA)
will add 22 new Microbus routes in September.
	   In the business revitalisation plan to salvage the ailing
Microbus services, TMA has been given the concession to operate 22
additional bus routes and the Bangkok Motor Equipment Co (BAE), the
current operator, to continue its 14 existing routes.
	   BAE was the original concessionaire operating the entire
Microbus service, but was forced to ask for city intervention
following sagging revenues and mounting debts.
	   TMA's buses will look different from the present Microbus but
the fare will be the same Bt20, a source at the company said.
	   The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration on Tuesday decided to
pull out of the deal to join the management of the Microbus
services on grounds of its heavier-than-expected financial burden.

Lawsuit tries to stop settler organization from building in
</HEADLINE>
Jerusalem  
  By VITA BEKKER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli peace group filed suit Thursday to
try to stop Jewish settlers from building a new enclave in the
Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Ir Shalem filed suit in Israel's Supreme Court against the group
Ateret Cohanim, which is leading a campaign to settle Jews in Arab
neighborhoods of Jerusalem. Ir Shalem advocates the establishment
of a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured
in 1967.
	   Last week Ateret Cohanim erected seven tin sheds on a plot of
land near Herod's Gate in the Muslim Quarter, setting off clashes
with Palestinian legislators and other protesters.
	   The unauthorized sheds were removed by city workers, but Ateret
Cohanim won the right to maintain and guard the site.
	   ``It's simply insanity to put them in as guards,'' said Daniel
Seidemann, Ir Shalem's lawyer. Seidemann said the city was
illegally giving Ateret Cohanim a foothold on the land.
	   In the suit, Ir Shalem asks that the agreement to allow Ateret
Cohanim to guard the site be declared illegal; that the group be
denied any rights to the land; and that it be prevented from filing
building plans for the site.
	   On Wednesday, a city planning commission heard Ateret Cohanim's
proposal to build high-rise apartments and a school at the site.
The commission is scheduled to vote on the proposal next week.
	   ``They are trying to strip us of our civil rights,'' said Ateret
Cohanim. director Yossi Baumel. ``No one goes to court to stop
Arabs from building.''
	   Baumel said he was not worried about the lawsuit.
	   ``I am sure the court case will have the same result as all the
past ones,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We've come out clean
every single time.'' vb-hla

US-BASED international ratings agency Moody's Investors Service

<TEXT>
has said that Thai sovereign ratings are unlikely to be reviewed in
the next six to 18 months.
	   ''We believe the Ba1 rating is likely to be stable over that
period of time,'' managing director of corporate rating of Moody's
Asia Pacific Ltd Julia Turner said Wednesday at a conference on
''Credit Rating Agency's Perspectives on Southeast Asian and Thai
Economic Prospects''.
	   Moody's has assigned 'Ba1' foreign currency ratings for
Thailand, which is below investment grade or junk bond status,
given the ongoing economic uncertainties as well as deteriorating
assets in the banking and finance sectors.
	   Turner noted that the current ratings reflect Thailand's actual
economic fundamentals and that the regional economic environment
has also been taken into account.Despite the expected second wave
of regional financial crisis, Turner sees no sign of such a crisis
within the next six to eight months. To avoid it, she suggested
that Asian governments improve their accounting standards to give
an early warning of impending problems.Turner's suggestion
coincided with three government agencies announcing that Thailand
Financial Accounting Standard Board (TFASB) is scheduled to
complete the internationalisation of accounting standards and
corporate management responsibilities for distorted information by
December.
	   In the case of Thailand, Turner sees a series of beneficial
policies but some dislocation and difficulties that will ensue if
the government is not successful in implementing the reforms.
	   Furthermore, transparency as well as faster enforcement of
bankruptcy laws will help corporates restructure their debts and
that will draw foreign capital back into the country more rapidly.
	   For a bright future, Turner said that Thailand should get back
foreign capital which will help clean up the financial mess.
	   ''It's very constructive [to get foreign money back into the
country],'' she added.
	   The government of Premier Chuan Leekpai has launched sweeping
financial and economic reforms to try to get Thailand out of its
worst economic crisis in decades.

YOUNG Men's Christian Association (YMCA) members are furious

<TEXT>
about a plan to redevelop the club's outdoor facilities, which will
see the tennis courts closed for a year.
	   Members said the first they knew of the plan to temporarily
close the King's Park club facilities in Kowloon was when regular
tennis lessons were cancelled.
	   The site currently houses two tennis courts and a lawn with some
changing facilities.
	   Plans include three new tennis courts, a multi-purpose pitch for
roller hockey, basketball and football, a volleyball court, an
outdoor climbing wall and a landscaped area for croquet.
	   The $40 million revamp will also include changing rooms and
redecoration of the assembly hall.
	   But 13 members are unhappy about the revamp, saying they prefer
the facility as it is now.
	   ``It is so beautiful down there,'' said member Alexandra Yeadon.
``There are certain things that are above money.'' YMCA general
secretary Chuck Allison said permission was being sought from the
government to go ahead with plan. Work was due to be completed next
summer, he said.

THE Highways Department has commissioned a $78 million 12-month

<TEXT>
consultancy for the design and construction of the Central Kowloon
Route.
	   A spokesman for the department said the consultancy had been
awarded to Atkins China which would ensure tunnel alignment and
carry out environmental, traffic and drainage assessments. Site
investigation work would also be carried out.
	   The proposed $4.7 billion route includes a 2.6-kilometre dual
two-lane tunnel between the West Kowloon reclamation and the future
southeast Kowloon development at Yau Ma Tei.
	   Work is expected to begin in 2003 for completion in 2007.
	   Project manager Robert Lloyd of the Major Works Project
Management Office of the Highways Department said new development
projects would generate substantial traffic.
	   The route would provide a high capacity, segregated corridor for
east-west traffic in Central Kowloon.
	   A feasibility study in January confirmed the viability of a dual
two-lane, side-by-side tunnel in the west, a bored tunnel through
the centre of Kowloon and a double-deck tunnel in the east.

Fresh bid to help finance firms restructure loans THE Bank of

<TEXT>
Thailand (BOT) Wednesday issued new regulations for the
restructuring of embattled financial institutions' loans in an
effort to help the sector adjust to the changing business
environment.
	   The central bank earlier announced the new provisioning rules,
requiring financial institutions to set aside reserves for
classified loans which range from ''general loans'' to ''loss
loans''. The rules will be fully effective at the end of 2000 when
the provisions must be set aside 100 per cent.
	   In the new regulations announced Wednesday, the central bank
allowed the financially-weak institutions, which are restructuring
loans to use their present net value, to complete their profit/loss
financial statement. They are also allowed to use the value of
collateral to calculate the loss incurred from the restructuring.
	   Tarisa Watanages, director of the BOT Financial Institutions
Supervision and Development Department, said that internationally,
performing collateral, including apartments with constant rents,
are used for the calculation.
	   ''In Thailand, we relax the rule by allowing the use of
non-performing collateral. Yet, the institutions need independent
auditors for the appraisal of collateral used by a related company
for borrowing from banks,'' she said.
	   She noted that the regulations would ensure transparent debt
restructuring in the beleaguered economy as it demands a formal
strategy to cover every stage of the restructuring process, with
clearly defined responsibilities and accountability.
	   The central bank said in a statement that financial institutions
would be required to provide action plans, continued monitoring and
follow-up reports to ensure that the process was objective.
	   In cases where debtors are unable to meet the obligations of
restructured contracts, financial institutions must immediately
re-classify the loans as impaired following the guidelines issued
by the BOT.
	   Under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund, Thailand
has made the restructuring of its debt-laden financial institutions
a priority in restoring the ailing economy.
	   The BOT closed down over half of the country's finance firms
last year and has taken control of a handful of banks, ordering
them to write off bad debts and seek fresh capital. The country now
has 35 finance companies and 15 banks, including the seven
suspended finance companies.

Turkish city refusing bids from France over Armenian issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ Angered by a French motion recognizing the
1915 killings of Armenians in Turkey as a ``genocide,'' the city of
Izmir said Thursday it will bar French firms from bidding for a
subway construction project.
	   The decision came a week after France's National Assembly
unanimously adopted a one-sentence motion stating: ``France
publicly recognizes the Armenian genocide of 1915.''
	   ``We will not accept bids from French firms as long as the
French policy is not changed,'' Haluk Narbay, a municipality
spokesman, told The Associated Press by telephone. ``They are
misrepresenting the historical facts.''
	   Turkey denies that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide, insisting that losses
occurred on both sides as the result of a civil war.
	   He said three French firms are interested in the dlrs 275
million project to build an eight-kilometer (five-mile) subway in
Izmir. He did not give the names of the companies.
	   The municipality also decided not to allow French firms to open
stands at an annual summer trade fair in Izmir.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that President Suleyman
Demirel has written French President Jacques Chirac asking him to
block the motion. Turkey has said that the motion, if upheld by the
French Senate, could seriously hurt Turkish-French ties.

compared to previous days.
	   According to PDB sources, a total of 380 mw power has been
generated at three power plants - Raozan unit no-1 and 2 and Kaptai
Hydraulic Project on June 2. But city-dwellers have been suffering
much due to frequent power disruption following tripping of power.
	   The PDB men could not detect the enormity of loadshedding
imposed in the city as they failed to count it properly.According
to PDB sources, about 1400 mw power has generated in all the plants
in the country on June 2. Power generation at Kaptai Hydraulic
Plant has been slightly improved to 90 mw form 40 mw on June 1 with
the removal of garbage from the lake.
	   Another PDB sources said, about 150 mw power has been
distributed in the national grid from the plants of Chittagong.

AN accused tobacco executive told a jury he was paid $33 million

<TEXT>
for giving legitimate help to a multi-billion-dollar Taiwanese
cigarette smuggling operation.
	   Jerry Lui Kin-hong, 42, said he helped Chen Ying-jen find
distributors for Japanese cigarettes smuggled in from Hong Kong and
passed on market intelligence.
	   At the time of the first payment Lui was working for Brown and
Williamson Tobacco Corporation in Taiwan but said he did not see
helping Chen as a clash of interests.
	   Lui denies conspiring with former directors of Giant Island,
including Chen, to accept $33 million in advantages between August
1988 and May 1993.
	   Prosecutors allege he plotted to take $23 million in cash and
$10 million in loans to ensure the sale and supply of cigarettes to
Giant Island and associated tobacco firms from British-American
Tobacco (BAT).
	   But defence lawyer Kevin Egan said the first three payments,
totalling almost $6 million, were made when Lui was working for B 
W in Taiwan between 1988 and 1990.
	   Lui said it would have been ``impossible'' to help Giant Island
get cigarettes from BAT at that time.
	   The next two payments of $8 million were made while Lui worked
for B  W in Hong Kong before Lui was even seconded to BAT.
	   Even after he worked for BAT Lui said he was ``hated'' by staff
there and had no power to influence the supply to distributors.
	   Lui said the money was paid by Chen, who smuggled Japanese
cigarettes into Taiwan between 1986 and 1994 because the trade was
banned.
	   Lui said the cigarettes came from Hong Kong.
	   ``I told Mr Chen I could assist him getting into the
distribution network,'' Lui told the jury.
	   He also promised to pass on intelligence on the Taiwanese market
he was privy to from B  W studies.
	   ``Even if you have entered Taiwan, if no one is selling the
product for you it would be useless,'' Lui said.
	   ``That's why Chen would be greatly in need of this sort of
distribution network.
	   ``Once I had any intelligence I would inform him immediately,
which brands were in demand, prices .
	   .'' Lui testified.
	   ``He could make use of intelligence provided to purchase his
cigarettes in Hong Kong.'' Lui said he saw no conflict of interest
as B  W sold American cigarettes and Chen sold Japanese brands,
such as Mild Seven.
	   But he conceded he did not ask B  W for permission to accept
the payments as he did not expect they would grant it.
	   Chen told him to open a bank account and said he would ``not be
mean'' to him, Lui said.
	   Of the $1.6 billion worth of smuggled cigarettes Chen would be
able to make a 400 per cent profit _ $6.4 billion, Lui said.
	   He said Chen told him he made substantial profits out of
cigarettes.
	   But when he received his first payment _ US$250,000 _ he said he
was ``taken aback''.
	   ``I did not expect him to give me such money and therefore I did
not talk to him further about money.'' Asked if he knew the source
of the cash, Lui replied: ``I have no knowledge and I would not
care.'' His trial, before Justice Wally Yeung Chun-kuen, continues.

Solzhenitsyn's latest book goes on sale, but few care
</HEADLINE>
  With AP Photo  
  By MITCHELL LANDSBERG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new book by Alexander Solzhenitsyn went on sale
Thursday to a predictably subdued welcome. It was yet another
indication of how far his reputation in Russia has fallen since the
collapse of communism.
	   ``Russia in Collapse,'' the Nobel laureate's second book since
returning from exile in 1994, had a print run of only 5,000 copies
and is initially being sold at only one bookstore _ that of his
publisher.
	   ``This is no longer Solzhenitsyn's time in the spotlight,'' Alla
Latynina, deputy editor of Literaturnaya Gazeta, told the Moscow
Times in a colossal bit of understatement.
	   A decade or two ago, the publication of a new book by
Solzhenitsyn would have electrified the literary world here and
abroad. But today, the author of ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovitch,'' ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' ``Cancer Ward'' and other
acclaimed works is considered by many Russians to be a has-been at
best, a dangerous crank at worst.
	   He had far more influence in his native land when he was a
dissident and, eventually, an exile. Now that Russians are free to
read him, hardly anybody wants to.
	   In an interview with the weekly newspaper Obshchaya Gazeta,
Solzhenitsyn complained about his inability to connect with Russian
readers.
	   Today, he said, ``You can speak, but nobody will hear.'' He
added that his efforts to influence Russian policy have had all the
impact of ``peas on a concrete wall.''
	   The new book, like his last, ``The Russian Question at the End
of the 20th Century,'' is largely an indictment of post-Soviet
Russia, which he sees as dominated by greed, corruption and
cultural decline. He calls for a return to tradition.
	   ``One should not serve the current government but the
Fatherland,'' he writes in one typical passage. ``The Fatherland is
that which raised us up together. It is higher than we are, above
any passing constitution.
	   ``No matter what devastation exists at the moment, we still have
time to overcome and be worthy of our indestructible 1,100-year-old
past. It is the achievement of tens of generations before us and
after us.''
	   ``Russia in Collapse'' is a small book by Solzhenitsyn's
standards _ 204 pages in a paperback-size format.
	   While few people would disagree with his criticisms, many find
his proposed solutions to be overly conservative, nationalistic and
_ perhaps worst of all _ irrelevant.

UJUNGPADANG, South Sulawesi: Governor Z.B. Palaguna confirmed

<TEXT>
yesterday that Ujungpandang Secretary Hakamuddin Jamal and the head
of the administration's political directorate, Dick Dernadi, had
been removed from their posts.
	   Palaguna would not say why the two were removed but admitted
that it was connected to the countless demands for reform.
	   The governor refused to say whether the removal was connected to
reports of corruption, retorting that Hakamuddin was a dedicated
and loyal servant, and that the decision was the prerogative of the
Ministry of Home Affairs in Jakarta. (37)

PURWOKERTO, Central Java: The election of village chiefs in 80

<TEXT>
villages in the Banyumas regency has been postponed for reasons of
``security and order''.
	   Banyumas Regent Aris Setiono confirmed the postponement but
would not elaborate on the reasons.
	   ``It's to maintain security and order,'' he remarked without
saying how long the postponement would be.
	   The head of the regency's public affairs office, Noer Sigit,
acknowledged that the delay was related to demonstrations and
protests going on in several of the villages.
	   He said there was a fear that the elections could spark unrest
if held now, adding that the protests were connected to
dissatisfaction over the selection process of the village
candidates.
	   ``In anticipation of possible unrest we have had to take firm
action and for now cancel all elections in the 80 villages,'' Noer
told The Jakarta Post here yesterday. (45)

WELL-known footballer Eric Cantona surprised fans by making a

<TEXT>
personal appearance at the Manchester United Supporters Clubhouse
in Petaling Jaya recently.
	   On an official visit to Malaysia to attend a pro-beach football
tournament, he spent about two hours talking to fans.
	   Club branch secretary Laurence How said Cantona also obliged
those wanting photographs by signing everything and anything
ranging from posters to books and scraps of paper.
	   A good number offered their jerseys and T-shirts for signing and
one member brought along a crayon painting of Cantona.
	   Though Manchester United fans were disappointed by their team's
failure to win the Premiership, this was compensated to some extent
by his appearance.
	   Club branch secretary Laurence How said ``King Cantona'' had no
airs about him and carried himself well. To cap the occasion, a
birthday cake was presented to celebrate his 32nd birthday.
	   Not knowing what their ``hero'' wished for, his fans wished that
Cantona would perform on the field again.
	   How said the meeting was a treat to fans and had left a lasting
impression of Cantona.
	   The No 7 jersey which he wore at the pro-beach football
tournament was later presented to the clubhouse.

Aircraft bombing icejams in northern Russia to prevent floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four fighter planes bombed an icejam on the
Pechora River in northern Russia on Thursday in an effort to
prevent flooding.
	   The ice has piled up 30 kilometers (18 miles) downriver from the
city of Naryan-Mar, capital of the Nenets region, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   On Wednesday, demolition experts broke up an icejam 65
kilometers (40 miles) upstream. Water that had inundated the
villages of Labozhskoye and Velikovisochnoye has receded, ITAR-Tass
said.

JAKARTA (JP): Thousands of activists and students demonstrated

<TEXT>
at the House of Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly
complex yesterday, loudly demanding that the assembly convene an
extraordinary session and arrange a general election.
	   The protesters also demanded that former president Soeharto be
tried for alleged corruption, and that his successor, President
B.J. Habibie, resign.
	   Arriving in droves, the 2,500 protesters demanded to see House
Speaker Harmoko but were barred from entering by 1,000 military and
police officers stationed inside the complex.
	   Undeterred the activists began a demonstration in front of the
compound which caused heavy congestion on Jl. Gatot Subroto.
	   The students, calling themselves the Greater Jakarta Forum of
Students, arrived outside the house building in 30 buses, which
they used to tour the city when they had finished demonstrating.
	   Among the ranks of the protesters were 200 supporters of leading
opposition figure Megawati Soekarnoputri. They demanded that a
general election be held to recruit new House members because the
current legislative body had been ``elected unconstitutionally.''
	   The group cited the way in which Soeharto's administration had
excluded members of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) loyal to
Megawati from last year's general election.
	   The government only recognizes the PDI grouping chaired by
Megawati's rival, Soerjadi. Megawati was ousted as the party's
leader in a government-sponsored congress in Medan, North Sumatra,
in 1996.
	   A group called Barisan Merah Putih and 70 activists from the
Indonesian Women's Coalition for Justice and Democracy also joined
the rally. The women were lead by lawyer Nursyahbani Katjasungkana
and Women's Solidarity chairwoman Taty Krisnawaty.
	   Before going to the House, the female activists staged a rally
in front of the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas)
office on Jl. Imam Bonjol in Central Jakarta, and demanded that
more money be allocated to provide food for the people.
	   ``The Indonesian Women's Coalition for Justice and Democracy is
concerned that the Habibie government has not yet announced any
clear plans to ensure food security for the people,'' coalition
member Julia I. Suryakusuma read out in a statement.
	   The coalition said that a clean government must be formed in the
shortest possible time thorough a democratic process.
	   They also demanded that the government reclaim state wealth
which they said had been ``looted'' by Soeharto, his family,
cronies and corrupt government officials.
	   Quicker
	   Also demonstrating at the House yesterday was a 40-strong
delegation from the Bandung Reform Movement (GRB), which arrived
earlier in the day and was therefore allowed to enter the compound.
They met with members of Golkar, the Armed Forces (ABRI), the
United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) factions, and demanded that the implementation of economic
reform be sped up.
	   ``People need food. They do not need politics. So we call for a
national consensus to gain a better solution for everyone,'' Koen
Soekarno, the group representative told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   Budi Hardjono from the PDI faction told the group that they
should present their ideas to President Habibie himself. ``As far
as I know, there has never yet been any pro-reform group which has
asked for a national consensus in a bid to solve the crisis facing
the nation,'' Budi said.
	   Separately, 1,500 students in Medan staged a sit-in protest at
the North Sumatra Police Headquarters. They refused to budge until
provincial police chief Brig. Gen. Sutyono heard their outrage over
the alleged sexual assault of female students by police officers
during recent demonstrations.
	   The students unfurled banners and waved posters, including one
which read: ``Respect women because your mothers too are women.''
	   A total of 26 female students reported they had been verbally
abused and sexually assaulted by officers when they left a
demonstration at Medan Teachers' Training College on May 4. Their
rector, Darmono, has filed a formal complaint with the police, the
Ministry of Education and Culture, and the National Commission on
Human Rights.
	   The Mitra Perempuan Women's Crisis Center, led by lawyer Rita
Serena Kolibonso, reported similar harassment of female students at
the May 12 demonstration at Trisakti University, Jakarta. During
the riots that followed, many women of Chinese origin were forced
to strip by rioters and some were raped in front of many people,
she said. (ivy/21/edt/swe)

Great news for the football fans! World Cup-98 is very near.

<TEXT>
Only a couple of days of waiting will fulfil your desire. This
topmost world favourite game only comes once in every four years.
This year France has got the lucky chance to organise the World
Cup. This is the 16th and the last World Cup of this century. This
year 32 football teams of 31 countries are participating in eight
groups. Great Britain is the only country with two football teams
,namely England and Scotland.
	   The countries which are playing in this World Cup are Brazil,

The final match will be held on July 12.This World Cup match is
divided into six parts. These are the first round, second round,
quarter final, semi-final, third place decided match and the final
match.Now let's have a glimpse of the history of the World Cup. The
World Cup match first started in 1930 in Uruguay.
	   Then the World Cup was known as the Jule Rime Trophy. This
trophy was designed and planned by an Italian architect Silvio
Gazanigo. The trophy is made of 18 carats gold and weighs 11 pounds
with a height of 20 inches. In 1934 the second World Cup was held

	   In 1978 in Argentina, in 1982 in Spain, in 1986 in Mexico, in
1990 in Italy, in 1994 in the USA and this year (1998) it is going
to be held in France.The Federation of International Football
Association (FIFA) is an international organisation. The head
office is situated in Zurich, Switzerland, (before 1974 it was
situated in France).The World Cup is being sponsored by two big
companies, Coca Cola and Addidas since 1974.The name of the
president of FIFA is Joe Havelange. His term is going to end after
this World Cup. Let us hope that the World Cup will bring a lot of
fun for the soccer-loving fans of the world.

JAKARTA (JP): Facing threats of dissension and calls for reform,

<TEXT>
the country's dominant political organization, Golkar, decided
yesterday to hold an extraordinary congress in July at which
chairman Harmoko is likely to be replaced.
	   The organization which has had a stranglehold on Indonesian
politics for more than two decades had originally scheduled its
five-yearly congress and chairmanship election for October.
	   The decision to hold an extraordinary congress was reached at a
meeting of Golkar leaders yesterday. Harmoko, who appeared to be
calm despite the pressure mounting on him to resign, announced the
meeting's result himself.
	   Of the 27 regional chapters attending the meeting, 23 strongly
demanded an immediate extraordinary congress. The other four --
Aceh, Bengkulu, Yogyakarta and Southeast Sulawesi -- abstained.
	   Eight chapters -- Jambi, Jakarta, East Java, East and West Nusa
Tenggara, and also South, Central and West Kalimantan -- asked
Harmoko to resign at the upcoming extraordinary congress.
	   One of Golkar's traditional allies, Musyawarah Kekeluargaan
Gotong Royong (MKGR) broke ranks from Golkar last week and
established itself as an independent political party. Another ally,
Kosgoro, said it was considering a similar move.
	   Yesterday, Harmoko refused to say whether he would resign to
meet his critics' demands that this was the only way to save the
organization from crumbling as it was losing people's confidence.
	   ``I am a Golkar cadre, I will not hold on to a position
forever,'' he said. ``One thing is for sure, I am not willing to be
renominated in the next chairmanship election.''
	   The July congress will decide on various matters such as
Golkar's next leadership and whether it was still necessary to
maintain the board of patrons and board of advisors, he said.
	   Golkar's chief patron is fallen president Soeharto, and among
its leaders is Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana.
	   The congress would also discuss Golkar's concept for future laws
on political parties.
	   Speaking about the ongoing reform campaign, Harmoko said Golkar
supported the government's plan for an immediate extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly and general
elections.
	   Civil servants
	   In a related development, all 51,000 members of the Indonesian
Civil Servants Corps (Korpri) at the Ministry of Forestry withdrew
their support for Golkar and called on the corp's executive board
to follow suit.
	   Sumahadi, chairman of the ministry's Korpri chapter, said the
chapter was throwing its weight behind the reform campaign and
would from now on take a neutral stance in party politics.
	   Korpri members, who number about six million nationwide,
traditionally vote or are made to vote for Golkar in general
elections.
	   ``The Korpri chapter at the forestry ministry supports total
reform of the political, economic and legal fields and will go to
the front line to eliminate corrupt, colluding and nepotistic
practices at the ministry, state-owned forestry company PT Inhutani
and state-owned plantation companies,'' said Sumahadi, who was the
forestry minister for two months under Soeharto's last
administration.
	   Government regulation No. 20/1976 allows civil servants to join
any of the three political organizations and says they are free to
vote according to their personal choice in general elections.

JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie will soon issue a

<TEXT>
presidential decree to abolish the 2 percent levy imposed on
individual and corporate taxpayers to finance former president
Soeharto's poverty-alleviation program, Minister of Finance Bambang
Subianto announced yesterday
	   He also said that Habibie would revoke a 1988 presidential
decree which required producers of cigarettes, alcoholic beverages
and other products subject to excise stamps to pay an additional Rp
1 for each stamp they purchased from the Directorate General of
Customs and Excise. This levy was allocated to fund the scouting
movement.
	   Speaking to reporters after an economic cabinet meeting, Bambang
said the planned revocations were aimed at improving the state's
financial discipline and providing certainty to the business
community.
	   ``Those rulings are not consistent with budget discipline
because they are not aligned with the budget. On the other hand,
they create confusion among investors in calculating their taxes.''
	   Presidential Decree No.90/1995, later superseded by Presidential
Decree No. 92/1996, requires individuals and companies with annual
after-tax incomes or profits of more than Rp 100 million (about
US$9,000 at current exchange rates) to donate up to 2 percent of
their earnings to the privately run Dana Sejahtera Mandiri
Foundation to fund poverty-alleviation schemes.
	   Soeharto established the foundation in January 1996 and remains
its chairman.
	   Soeharto's close associate Sudono Salim, also known as Liem Sioe
Liong, who chairs the giant Salim Group, cousin Sudwikatmono, son
Bambang Trihatmodjo and Sudono's son Anthony Salim were also
involved in the foundation's operation.
	   Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare/Poverty Eradication
Haryono Suyono said Tuesday that Soeharto's chairmanship of the
foundation could be reviewed.
	   Haryono also reported that the foundation had collected a total
of Rp 1.5 trillion (about US$135 million at current rate) from
taxpayers and channeled about Rp 1 trillion to poor families across
the country, especially in Java.
	   He hoped the affluent would continue to voluntarily make
donations to the foundation.
	   Bambang said the poverty-alleviation program would continue
through funding from the state budget.
	   ``Of course, we must consider the state financial situation so
that all immediate needs for funds can be met proportionally,'' he
said. (prb/rid)

Batistuta earns starter spot in Argentine World Cup team
</HEADLINE>
  By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ In spite of a history of differences with
head coach Daniel Passarella, striker Gabriel Batistuta on Thursday
appeared assured a starter spot in Argentina's soccer World Cup
Team.
	   As Passarella confirmed the shirt number assigned to each
player, the apparent starting team included two surprises: Carlos
Roa in the goal instead of German Burgos, and left back Hector
Pineda instead of Javier Zanetti.
	   Batistuta, the striker of Fiorentina of Italy, was given shirt
number 9, usually reserved by Passarella for the team's starting
center forward.
	   Ariel Ortega, the skillful midfielder of Valencia of Spain,
received the number 10 shirt which Diego Maradona donned in the
last four World Cups.
	   If, as expected, players receiving shirts numbers 1 through 11
will consitute the starting team, Passarella isn't planning many
changes.
	   Batistuta, who was not considered by Passarella during most of
the South American qualifying series, was finally called up as
Argentine fans virtually screamed for him.
	   And the dashing striker did not disappoint anyone, scoring in
virtually every match he played, including the latest World Cup
warm-up games. Last month, he scored in the Argentina's 1-0 win
over Chile and added one in the 2-0 victory over South Africa.
	   When Passarella coached River Plate, his disputes with Batistuta
virtually forced the player to emigrate to Italy, whether he has
remained for several years among the league's top scorers.
	   In spite of his success there, Passarella for months refused to
nominate him to the national squad.
	   At a news conference late Wednesday, Passarella refused to
comment on whether he has decided to include Batistuta in the team
for the June 14 match with Japan _ the opening game in World Cup
Group H which also includes Croatia and Jamaica.
	   Noting that Abel Balbo and Julio Crespo also are available, he
added, ``You are not going to criticize me now for bringing so many
attackers, right?''
	   He said he will only announce his team on the eve of the match
against Japan, but if the way he has handled things in the past is
an indication, this is expected to be the lineup: Carlos Roa,
Roberto Ayala, Jose Chamot, Hector Pineda, Matias Almeyda, Roberto
Sensini, Claudio Lopez, Diego Simeone, Gabriel Batistuta, Ariel
Ortega, Juan Veron.

Palestinian court orders release of Hamas spokesman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian Supreme Court on
Thursady ordered the release of Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi,
his lawyer said.
	   Rantisi was arrested by Palestinian police in April after he
made statements critical of the Palestinian Authority. He was
charged with endangering national security.
	   Judge Jamil Ashi ordered him released because of lack of
evidence, Rantisi's lawyer Iyad Alami told The Associated Press.
	   Rantisi remained in custody Thursday evening and Alami said the
order is ``still under implementation.'' He said, however, that he
expected his client's release soon.
	   Palestinian security forces usually ignore court orders and keep
detainees in custody until their release is approved by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who is under pressure from Israel and the
United States to crack down on militant groups such as Hamas.
	   Rantisi was arrested after he blamed the Palestinian Authority
and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and security chiefs
for collaborating with Israel in the March 29 death of Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif was found dead March 29 at the scene of a car explosion
in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hamas accused Israel and the
Palestinian Authority of collaborating in the death, but a
Palestinian Authority investigation concluded that Sharif was the
victim of a power struggle within Hamas.

Albright sees South Asian arms race as `uniquely dangerous'
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan; India-Nuclear; Disarmament-Iran  
  AP Photo GEV101-102  
  By JOHN DIAMOND  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
rushed Thursday to join an emergency meeting of the world's five
official nuclear powers, characterized the recent nuclear testing
by rival neighbors India and Pakistan as ``uniquely dangerous.''
	   She and the foreign ministers of Russia, China, France and
Britain were prepared to unite behind the common goal of defusing
nuclear tension on the Asian subcontinent, she said. Carrying
instructions from President Bill Clinton, Albright also intended to
revive the global arms control agenda staggered by last month's
atomic tests.
	   The five major powers were working on a communique that would
offer mediation services and emphasize the urgency of India's and
Pakistan's rejoining the global arms-control movement, said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   While nuclear weapons have been around since 1945, the actions
of Pakistan and India mark the first time that the longtime rivals,
who share a common border, have escalated their potential for
conflict to the nuclear level, Albright said.
	   First on the agenda at the meeting at U.N. headquarters in
Geneva was reducing tension. The U.S. delegation planned to raise a
range of proposals, from convincing India and Pakistan to refrain
from further nuclear tests to the possibility of international
mediation over the disputed Kashmir region.
	   ``Right now, the most important thing both sides can do is to
cool it and take a deep breath and begin to climb out of the hole
they have dug themselves into,'' Albright said.
	   Albright met with the meeting's chairman Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and also separately with Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov early Thursday in preparation of the hastily
arranged joint session.
	   Just what leverage the five nuclear nations have to induce
Pakistan and India to cooperate was unclear.
	   U.S. officials were frank in acknowledging that sanctions, or
the threat of sanctions, failed to prevent India and Pakistan from
testing their weapons.
	   At the same time, the Clinton administration is no mood to offer
incentives or rewards to two countries that have thrown the arms
control and counter-proliferation agenda into disarray.
	   ``It would be highly ironic and unacceptable if we were to
provide to those who have broken the rules some benefits that do
not accrue to those who have willingly given it up,'' Albright said
earlier in Washington.
	   She was referring to South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakstan,
Brazil and Argentina _ countries that have renounced their nuclear
weapons programs.
	   Albright laid out three goals for the five powers to pursue:
	   _Convince India and Pakistan to refrain from further testing,
from deploying nuclear-tipped missiles and from further
inflammatory rhetoric.
	   _Avert a regional arms race in south Asia and ease tension over
Kashmir.
	   _Convince both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and agree to a proposed treaty that would ban the production
of ``fissile materials'' _ plutonium and highly enriched uranium _
needed to make nuclear weapons.

JAKARTA (JP): The Insurance Council of Indonesia (DAI) urged its

<TEXT>
members yesterday to honor claims raised by owners of shopping
centers, shop/houses and shops affected by riots last month.
	   Council chairman Munir Sjamsoeddin told reporters that retailers
whose premises and shops were burned or looted during the unrest
could claim damages if their policies included insurance for riots,
strikes and malicious damages (RMDS).
	   ``Fire insurance policies without the RMDS clause would not be
eligible for compensation claims.'' But Munir said the council
could not force insurance firms to pay the claims.
	   ``Companies have different opinions on the nature of the riots.
We have no way to force them (to pay),'' he said, adding that a
government statement was only one of several factors used by
insurance firms to determine the nature of an incident.
	   DAI had earlier stated that the unrest was political in nature,
but several government officials have said that the riots were
merely acts of crime.
	   Fire insurance policies, even with the RMDS clause, exclude
damages resulting from politically motivated disturbances.
	   Munir said the council was now in the process of gathering
information to determine the value of the claims raised by policy
holders.
	   ``Adjusting the damage value is not easy. From past experience,
it could take between one and 12 months, depending on the
complexity of the cases.''
	   He said the claimants must produce sufficient documents needed
to prove the value of their damaged properties.
	   For example, owners of burned stores could show their store
stock cards as evidence of the store's value.
	   Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita estimated earlier that the property losses
incurred during the outbreak totaled Rp 2.5 trillion (US$250
million).
	   The Indonesian Retail Merchants Association said last month its
33 members that had stores and outlets looted or burned during the
massive riots reported at least Rp 661.52 billion in damages,
excluding losses from damaged and burned property.
	   The association said 90 percent of its members, which include
the country's major retail chains of Hero supermarkets and Ramayana
department stores, were covered by insurance.
	   But he said most of the small shop/houses destroyed during the
massive riots which started May 13 did not have RMDS as part of
their insurance policies.
	   Munir dismissed the question whether the huge damage claims
would lead to the fall of the country's insurance sector, which is
weak in capital.
	   ``Insurance firms which have good risk management will not go
bankrupt,'' he said.
	   Reports indicate that many insurance companies have capital as
low as Rp 3 billion and only retain 10 percent of the compensation
values at the most.
	   About 80 percent of their underwriting values are reinsured
through foreign insurance companies due to their weak financial
capacity.
	   Whether or not the riot victims could receive their
compensation, it would rest on the decision of foreign insurers, he
said.
	   The director of insurance in the finance ministry, Suyoto, said
yesterday there were about 106 insurance companies with loss
policies in the country. (das)

Hezbollah distances itself from Marine bombing but praises attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Seeking to shed its violent past,
Hezbollah has claimed it had no link to the 1983 U.S. Marine
bombing, saying the suicide attack that killed 241 Americans was
carried out by an ``independent'' group.
	   However, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said he wholeheartedly supported
the attack.
	   It's always been strongly suspected that the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah was behind the bombings of the Marines and two U.S.
Embassy buildings as well as the kidnapping of 90 foreigners,
including 17 Americans, during the 1980s in war torn Lebanon.
	   Shadowy pro-Iranian groups, which claimed responsibility for
most of the acts, were believed to have operated under Hezbollah's
umbrella, using cover names to thwart possible American
retaliation.
	   Nasrallah denied any link to the violent acts in a television
interview Wednesday night.
	   ``Hezbollah has nothing to do with the kidnapping of foreigners
or the Marine operation,'' Nasrallah told the private Murr TV
station.
	   Asked who carried out the bombing of the Marines at Beirut
airport on Oct. 23, 1983, Nasrallah said: ``a group that is
completely independent from Hezbollah.'' He did not name the group.
	   He said he supported the attack because of American support for
Israel.
	   ``Frankly, I bless those who bombed the Marine headquarters ...
We wished it was Hezbollah who carried it out,'' he said.
	   Hezbollah, under Nasrallah's moderate leadership, has
transformed itself into a mainstream movement championing social
and economic issues and waging a guerrilla war against Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon.
	   The U.S. State Department says that Hezbollah still engages in
terrorism.

Hellenic Petroleum to stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's state-owned Hellenic Petroleum
expects to gross dlrs 40 million per year, more than double its
current dlrs 15 million yearly earnings, after it goes public
sometime in June.
	   Top executives on Thursday said the company was ready to go
public and will float a 20 percent stake through a book-building
process and public offering between June 12-19. If the
book-building is successful, Hellenic Petroleum has an option to
sell an additional 3 percent.
	   ``Hellenic Petroleum has a leading position in the Greek
market... It is the first company that is state-owned that is going
into the stock market, that is important,'' said Nikos Karamouzis,
chairman of the Ionian Bank, which will help to lead manage the
company into the exchange.
	   According to Lefteris Tzellas, the company's managing director,
book-building for international investors will take place June
12-19, and public offering will occur June 17-19.
	   The share price for public and private offerings will be set
June 11, and the price for international institutional investors
will be fixed during the weekend of June 20-21.
	   Trading will take place on June 22 with shares selling between
1,800-2,000 drachmas (dlrs 6 and dlrs 6.6). Salomon Smith Barney
and SBC Warburg Dillon Reed have been appointed as lead managers
for this issue.

JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie has said his predecessor

<TEXT>
Soeharto grew too old to sense the mood of the people, and that his
own relative youth put him in a better position to lead the
country.
	   In his first newspaper interview since becoming president,
Habibie told the New York Times that he had not communicated with
76-year-old Soeharto, whom he once described as his political
mentor, since the handover on May 21.
	   ``It's a natural process, aging, you know,'' the 62-year-old
President said. ``I don't want to insult (him) because he has done
a lot for the country. But he's not a young man.
	   ``The students are my children and the students are his
grandsons. The gap between father and son is less than the gap
between grandfather and grandson. It is a generation gap, O.K.?''
	   The interview appeared on the front page of yesterday's
International Herald Tribune. Habibie also gave an interview to
Cable News Network (CNN) which was broadcast yesterday.
	   Habibie disclosed that repeated requests to meet with Soeharto
the morning he was promoted from vice president were rejected.
	   After he took the oath of office, Soeharto ``looked at me, he
shook hands, not a single word, just a smile. That's all''.
	   Although Habibie defended Soeharto against criticism of his
wealth, saying the former president was frugal, he denounced
Soeharto's children for their ``self-enrichment with a feudal
culture that treated them like royalty''.
	   Defending his own family's fortune, the German-trained aircraft
engineer said his relatives were highly educated and talented
people and that their wealth had been earned fairly.
	   Habibie said Indonesians should look to the future rather than
engage in ``Wild West'' justice in hunting for Soeharto's wealth.
	   ``If you dig into the past, then the past is unlimited, and I
have limited resources.''
	   Goal
	   He defined his goal as to restore public confidence and attract
foreign investment.
	   ``Now you have another person, you have another president.
	   ``You have another economic team. You have transparency. You
could never talk to President Soeharto the way you can talk to
me,'' he said. ``I am not the king.''
	   In his interview with CNN, Habibie said his role as President
was ``to bring in the shortest time possible the economy back and
to improve the democracy''.
	   Many people were more worried about ``their rice bowls, their
homes, to live in peace, the future for their children'' rather
than the question of who was president, he said.
	   He likened his newfound role as a reformer to counterparts Boris
Yeltsin in Russia and China's Zhu Rongji.
	   Habibie said a new general election would be held by the end of
1999, and a new People's Consultative Assembly would be convened to
elect a new president and vice president.
	   Asked whether he would run again, he responded that he would
consider his main mission accomplished if he brought economic
recovery and political reform to Indonesia ``as soon as possible''.

JAKARTA (JP): The Armed Forces (ABRI) reiterated its support for

<TEXT>
President B.J. Habibie yesterday, with Commander Gen. Wiranto
calling on the nation to give the government a chance to lift the
country out of its economic misery.
	   While reaffirming ABRI's commitment to reform, Wiranto called
for greater wisdom in pushing for change and warned that those who
pushed the line too far would have to deal with ABRI.
	   He also appealed to people to show respect to former president
Soeharto.
	   ``Without intending to belittle the demands for reform,
overcoming the crisis must now take priority and be made an
important agenda item that can no longer wait,'' he said in a rare
media briefing before a cabinet meeting at Bina Graha presidential
office.
	   This agenda included overcoming the financial and economic
crises, resolving unemployment and restoring public calm by meeting
the people's basic needs, he said.
	   ``Today, I reiterate ABRI's support for President B.J. Habibie
and for the Reform and Development Cabinet which faces daunting
tasks to overcome the crisis and lead the reformation movement,''
said Wiranto, who is also the minister of defense and security.
	   ``ABRI has always supported the legitimate and constitutional
government recognized by the people. So, let's all together give
the government the chance to take various positive steps to solve
the problems facing this nation,'' he said.
	   His statement comes amid calls for an extraordinary session of
the People's Consultative Assembly to formally remove Soeharto and
Habibie as president and vice president in order to make way for a
new leadership. Habibie has promised fresh elections next year to
form a new assembly which will elect a new president.
	   Spirit of reform
	   Wiranto said the movement for reform has intensified to the
point that some people are calling for change for the sake of
change or have departed from the spirit of reform itself.
	   ``ABRI realizes that reform is not without limits. Reform cannot
steamroller the limits set by Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution,
nationalism and national unity and cohesion.
	   ``ABRI is reminding all parties, wherever they may be, to keep
the reform movement on its proper track. We have to safeguard
reform so that it achieves its objectives and maintains its purity.
	   He underlined the need for a national commitment to resolve the
crisis.
	   ``Digging for past dirt will only disturb our concentration in
trying to move to a future which is filled with many problems.
	   ``The fate of this nation is ours to determine. It's our choice.
It is only appropriate, or even obligatory, that every responsible
citizen gives their contribution according to their capacity and
capability to overcome this crisis.''
	   Wiranto said that people who were calling for political reform
must do so with wisdom. ``Activities that exceed the limits and get
out of control will obstruct the reform progress, and they will
certainly have to face ABRI.''
	   On Soeharto, Wiranto said that like any human being, he had his
shortcomings but that it would be highly appreciated if the former
president, who had done a lot for the progress of the country over
30 years, was given more appropriate treatment.
	   ``Why can't we admit this? We are even allowing this wave of
condemnations, accusations and harassment without giving him the
chance to defend himself,'' said Wiranto, a former adjutant to the
former president.
	   He said such emotional and arbitrary actions against Soeharto
was ``denigrating the integrity of the nation.'' (prb/emb)

Old explosives wash up on Irish coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Eight explosive devices believed to date
from World War II have washed up on the Irish coast, an army
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The phosphorous-coated centers of what apparently were
incendiary bombs can be dangerous because the phosphorous ignites
when it dries and is exposed to oxygen, Commandant Eoghan O
Neachtain said.
	   ``We are warning people not to touch them, but to contact the
police,'' he said.
	   The devices were found Wednesday at two coastal sites north of
Dublin and may have come from the Beaufort Dyke, a deep-water
channel in the Irish Sea between Ireland and Scotland where British
wartime armaments were dumped, O Neachtain said.
	   The casings apparently have rusted off the bombs and there are
no markings to identify them, he said.
	   Seven devices washed up at Greenore, County Louth, near the
border with Northern Ireland, and one was found at Loughshinney, 40
miles (65 km) to the south, O'Neachtain said.
	   Irish Marine Minister Michael Woods was seeking information from
the British authorities about any recent disturbances of the seabed
in the area of the Beaufort Dyke.

  Eds: UPDATES with more of Tutu's testimony, defense accusations of
  Tutu says Botha has been humiliated in trial  
  AP Photos GEO101-103  
  By PAUL HARRIS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Former President P.W. Botha came out
the loser by refusing to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, panel chairman Desmond Tutu testified Thursday.
	   The retired Anglican archbishop was the latest witness to
testify against
	   the last hard-line leader of white rule who, as he has done
throughout his trial, looked on impassively.
	   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
activities, said Botha had humiliated himself by facing criminal
charges in court instead of complying with a subpoena to testify
before the Truth Commission.
	   ``The humiliation is the accused sitting here and I sought to
spare him that,'' Tutu said.
	   Botha has called the commission ``a circus,'' claiming it is
victimizing him by wanting him to appear in person when he has
submitted more than 1,700 pages of written answers to commission
questions.
	   In almost six hours of testimony, Tutu was grilled by defense
lawyer Lappe Laubscher, who accused the commission of ignoring
incidents where the African National Congress _ which waged a
guerrilla campaign against apartheid _ was reluctant to submit
information.
	   ``In the case of Mr. Botha you charge him, in the case of the
ANC you do nothing,'' Laubscher said.
	   While denying any bias, Tutu said he could not ignore the fact
that apartheid governments like Botha's were inherently wrong,
while the struggle against white rule was fought as a ``just war.''
	   ``I am not morally neutral about apartheid,'' he said ``It is
evil and I don't make any bones about it.''
	   Botha, 82, is being tried for contempt for snubbing the Truth
Commission. He faces up to two years in prison and unspecified
fines if convicted.
	   Earlier, apartheid's most notorious killer, ex-police death
squad commander Eugene de Kock, testified that he believed the
murders and bombings he carried in defense of apartheid had been
sanctioned from the highest levels.
	   De Kock is serving a 212-years prison sentence for his crimes.
He called his former political bosses cowards who had sold out the
footsoldiers who carried out their dirty work.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the ANC. The talks culminated in all-race
elections in 1994, which the ANC won.

  EDs: UPDATES with one pilot dead.  

<TEXT>
	   GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) _ A German fighter jet crashed
Thursday near a military airfield in Labrador, killing one of the
two pilots on board, authorities said.
	   The F4 Phantom, which was on a NATO training exercise, went down
about 24 kilometers (15 miles) north of the military airport at
Goose Bay, said Dan Bedell, spokesman at a regional search and
rescue center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
	   One of the pilots was rescued alive from the wreckage, said
Bedell. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known, but
were not believed to be life-threatening.
	   The crash happened at about 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT.).
Labrador is the mainland portion of the Atlantic province of
Newfoundland.
	   The names of the pilots were not immediately released.

Soccer is the number one game in the world and the World Cup

<TEXT>
Soccer during the last 68 glorious years has produced a number of
superstars of the game. Here are some of these heroes:Uruguay
1930Guillermo El Infiltrador' Stabile (Argentina): The youngster
came into the team for Manuel Ferreyra and scored three goals in a
6-3 defeat of Mexico.Italy 1934Luisito Monti (Italy): Despite being
Argentinean by birth, and actually having represented Argentina in
1930, he played for Italy. He was joined in the Italian team by
compatriots Orsi and Guaita.
	   The latter scored the semi-final winner against Hugo Meisl's
Austrian Wunderteam'. The three were not heroes of Argentina.France
1938Leonidas, the Black Diamond (Brazil): He scored four in a 6-5
defeat of Poland and was given the captaincy for the third-place
play-off only 66 years after slavery was abolished in his
country.Brazil 1950Larry Gaetjens (USA): A Haitian by birth, he
scored the goal that beat England in what was by then undoubtedly
the greatest upset of all time.
	   He sadly later dropped from view on his home island.Switzerland
1954Ferenc Puskas (Hungary): Still suffering from an injury
sustained earlier in the tournament, the greatest Hungarian player
ever to play in the World Cup nearly tied the game for the Magic
Magyars' with a late goal disallowed for off-side.Sweden 1958Just
(pronounced Joost) Fontaine (French): He set a record of 13 goals
in a single final series that was never beaten, though Gerd Mueller
of West Germany scored a total of 14 in 1960 and 1974
combined.Chile 1962Garrincha (Brazil): With lethal acceleration and
the ability to shoot with either foot, the right-winger from Pan
Grande transformed from the great player of Sweden 58 into the
universally recognised star of this brilliant Brazilian side.
	   England 1966Bobby Charlton (England): He was the inspiration for
the semi-final victory over Portugal that took England to Wembley.
Charlton scored twice in a classic match of impeccable
sportsmanship in which the first foul was not committed for 30
minutes.Mexico 1970Pele (Brazil): He earned his reputation as the
greatest player of all time with a series of scintillating
performances culminating in a headed goal, a nod-down for Jairzinho
to score, and the fourth and final goal in Brazil's defeat of
Italy.West Germany 1974Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany): Although
Johan Cruyff's team were the stars of the tournament, it was the
Kaiser' who eventually masterminded victory from his position as
attacking sweeper.
	   However, if Dutchman Johnny Rep had managed to convert Cruyff's
pass when Beckenbauer was left alone and stranded, it could have
been so different.Argentina 1978Mario Kempes (Argentina):
Centre-forward Mario Kempes proved himself the best striker in the
competition by scoring twice in the final and setting up Bertoni
for the third.Spain 1982Gerry Armstrong (Northern Ireland): His
first-half rally was enough to upset the hosts in the shock of the
tournament. The result was even more remarkable after the
questionable sending off of Mal Donaghy halfway through the second
half.Mexico 1986Diego Maradona (Argentina): His brilliant
individual effort against England in the quarter-finals remains one
of the most remarkable moments of genius ever witnessed at this
level.
	   Italy 1990Roger Milla (Cameron): Nobody knew how old he was
though he was certainly at least 38, but he was the fire in the
Cameroon team and his dances around the corner flags after each of
his four goals would never be forgotten.USA 1994Romario (Brazil):
Despite the well-reported rift between himself and his striking
partner Bebeto, he scored or had a hand in 10 of Brazil's 11 goals,
was outstanding throughout and showed true team spirit by joining
in the dedication of one goal to Bebeto's new-born baby.The World
Cup is the world's most important sporting event. We always speak
of the heroes of the previous World Cups, but there were some
villains too. Here are some of these villains, who were also parts
of the World Cups:Uruguay 1930Almedia Bego (Brazil): The referee
below six minutes early in Argentina's 1-0 defeat of France just as
Langiller looked like scoring. The French protested.
	   The referee relented and re-started the match, but no further
goals were scored.Italy-1934Benito Mussolini, Il Duci': He took
pride in his team and would appear at the Stadio Torino in Rome to
watch his aggressive azzurri' (blues) perform the fascist salute
before matches. The Italians made a million lire profit from the
tournament but few friends.France 1938The Italian team: Before the
Norway game, the Italians repeated the fascist salute they had made
in Rome four years earlier. Under orders, they held it until the
jeers of the crowd subsided. Later, however, they were able to
celebrate their win over Hungary.Brazil 1950Rajko Mitic
(Yugoslavia): He banged his head open on a girder and missed the
start of the Brazil game.
	   By the time he got on, Ademir had scored for the
opposition.Switzerland 1954Gill Merrick (England): A catalogue of
goalkeeping errors helped Uruguay defeat England 4-2, despite
having three players injured and no substitutes allowed to replace
them.Sweden 1958Kurt Hamrin (Sweden): He played magnificently and
scored as Sweden beat West Germany in the semi-finals, but he
contrived to get Juskowiak sent off for retaliation.Chile 1962Ken
Aston (England): The referee failed to control the Chile VS Italy
game that saw one Italian get his nose broken and two more sent
off. Giorgio Ferrini of Italy was made a scapegoat and was
suspended for one match.
	   It was eight minutes before the expelled player left the
field.England 1966Antonio Rattin (Argentina): Having had the better
of the game, the captain possibly cost his side victory when he was
sent off for dissent having already been booked in the
quarter-final against England. He refused to go and it took a full
10 minutes to get him off the pitch.Mexico 1970Jeff Astle
(England): West Brom's striker missed a total sitter in the group
game against Brazil. With England a goal down, Astle got the ball
in the 18-yard box and, with the net at his mercy, smacked it over
the bar.
	   The final score: England 0 Brazil 1.West Germany 1974Haitian
officials: After failing a dope test, the Haitian centre-half Ernst
Jean-Joseph was dragged out of his hotel, beaten, pushed into a car
and flown in Communicado to Haiti the following day. His doctor
failed to defend his claim that he took pills for asthma, and
Haiti, who had impressed against Italy, were thrashed by Poland and
Argentina.Argentina 1978Willie Johnston (Scotland): He failed a
dope test after his country's 3-1 defeat by Peru in their first
game and was sent home in disgrace. The Scots were held 1-1 by Iran
before recovering some pride by defeating the Dutch 3-2.
	   They still went out after the first stage.Spain 1982Harald
Schumacher (West Germany): With the semi-final poised at France 1
West Germany 1, Patrick Battiston raced on to a through ball.
Goalkeeper Schumacher came out to defend and brought him to the
ground with a vicious forearm that knocked out two of his teeth and
eliminated him from the game. No foul was given and Schumacher
remained on the field.Mexico 1986Diego Maradona (Argentina): His
brilliance was tarnished by the manner in which he achieved his
first goal in the quarter-final against England. The referee was
the only person in the world not to see the infamous hand of God'
incident, and Argentina won the match 2-1.
	   Italy 1990Rene Higuita (Colombia): The flamboyant goalkeeper's
recklessness cost his team the match against Cameroon. A full 40
yards out of his goal, he lost the ball of Roger Milla, who scored
what proved to be the goal that sent Colombia out.USA 1994Diego
Maradona (Argentina): The beleaguered Argentine captain was
expelled on failing a dope test after the 2-1 defeat of NigeriROFILE

FIFTY-five singers and 30 musicians from the Temple of Fine Arts

<TEXT>
orchestra combined their talents to give the best to the audience
at the opening of Sunrise Arts Fest '98.
	   The event was held at Mont' Kiara International School theatre
for three consecutive nights in aid of Siva Santa Medical Centre
and the Association for Disability Advancement Research Centre.
	   The musicians and singers took the audience through a journey of
Indian classical music with some Malaysian touches.
	   Themed We Are Malaysia - classical, cosmopolitan and charming
favourites, the presentation featured six songs - Perpaduan,
``Bless Us, O Lord'', ``Shanghai Beach'', ``Timeless'', ``Rhythm of
the Ocean'' and ``Om Shanti''.
	   In Perpaduan, the Malay melodies started with Demi Negara,
followed by songs like Rasa Sayang Eh and dikir barat.
	   ``Timeless'' featured a unique composition with Malay lyrics
being sung to the tune of Indian folk music. This was followed by
modern multi-lingual rap.
	   In ``Rhythm of the Ocean'', the audience was shown the power of
percussion instruments.
	   Music director Pandit Chandrakant Kapileshwari, who composed all
the music, said the Malay lyrics were written by his friend
Madhavan.
	   The second part of the show featured a colourful dance version
of a 1,500-year-old Chinese legend - Lady White Snake - which
featured 40-member cast of the Temple of Fine Arts.
	   The legend revolves around a young man Xu Xian who falls in love
with Bai Suzhen who is an immortal white snake.
	   The Sunrise Arts Fest '98 was held under the patronage of Datuk
Paduka Dr Saleha Mohd Ali. Present at the opening night were Kuala
Lumpur Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif and wife Puan Sri
Sharifah Ahmad.

Moscow mayor says Muscovites are water hogs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mayor Yuri Luzhkov claimed Thursday that Moscow's
water was up to European and world standards, but that residents
were using far too much of it, a news agency reported.
	   Luzhkov's assertion about water quality might surprise many
residents, who filter their water or drink bottled water if they
can afford it and are used to periodically seeing a murky brown
flow from their taps.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the mayor said Moscow
spent 1 billion rubles (dlrs 166 million) on environmental programs
over the past 5 years, improving water quality and drastically
cutting the discharge of heavy metals and other toxic wastes in its
sewage.
	   He complained that Moscow residents are using water ``extremely
wastefully,'' with per capita consumption of 400 liters (106
gallons) a day. He said that was double the average in other large
European cities.
	   Luzhkov threatened to begin charging for excess use of water. At
present, Moscow residents do not pay for water.
	   It is not clear why they might be using more than residents of
other cities. The vast majority of Muscovites live in highrise
apartment buildings, giving them no private gardens to water.
	   Moreover, every spring they lose all hot water for a month while
the city cleans its heating plants, so water consumption drops
dramatically as many people largely forego bathing until the hot
water returns.

Japanese panel calls for building 20 nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A government panel recommended on Thurdsay that
Japan build about 20 more nuclear power plants by 2010 to reduce
its reliance on fossil fuels and slash carbon dioxide emissions, a
news report said.
	   The plants would raise the ratio of nuclear power in the
country's power supply to 45 percent in 2010 from 34.6 percent in
1996, the Electricity Utility Industry Council said in an interim
report, according to Kyodo News.
	   Twenty additional plants would also cut carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants by 9 percent from 1990 levels, Kyodo quoted the
council as saying. Japan now has 51 nuclear power plants.
	   The council made the proposal on the assumption that power
consumption will grow at an average annual pace of 1.2 percent to
167 billion kilowatt-hours in 2010, Kyodo said.
	   The pace of growth in power consumption is about half the tempo
previously envisaged for the period, according to the report.
	   The council could not be reached late Thursday for comment.
	   The recommendations come as trust in Japan's nuclear industry
has fallen in recent years following a series of accidents and
cover-ups by operators. Local areas are increasingly reluctant to
have plants built in their neighborhoods.
	   A fire in March 1997 exposed 37 workers to low-level radiation
at a nuclear power plant on the Sea of Japan. There also was a
major leak at a prototype reactor that uses plutonium at a site
northeast of Tokyo.
	   The council said carbon dioxide emissions will increase
substantially by 2010 from 1990 levels unless Japan builds the
proposed 20 nuclear power plants or contains the pace of growth in
power consumption.

CHINA Telecom (Hong Kong) yesterday disclosed plans to invest

<TEXT>
US$1.98 billion (HK$15.44 billion) in its mobile phone network on
the mainland this year.
	   The company said it was making the huge investment to meet
demand from an expanding subscriber base.
	   ``We estimate the investment will be about US$1.98 billion in
network in the current fiscal year,'' said Ding Donghua, China
Telecom's chief financial officer, at the firm's annual meeting. Mr
Ding said the amount excluded any purchase and acquisition costs.
	   Faced with rapid growth in new subscribers the past few months,
China Telecom needed to improve its facilities, said Shi Cuiming,
the company's chairman and chief executive.
	   This year, China Telecom has added 950,000 cellular phone users,
giving it a total of more than 5.2 million customers, or a third of
the mainland's mobile phone market.
	   ``The second half of the year will be even better than the
first,'' said Mr Shi.
	   ``We need to upgrade our technology and increase the coverage of
our existing network to accommodate anticipated subscriber
growth,'' he said.
	   China Telecom shareholders approved in an extraordinary general
meeting yesterday the company's plan to buy the entire issued share
capital of Jiangsu Mobile BVI at a total cost of US$2.90 billion.
	   China Telecom plans to spend about 10 billion yuan (HK$9.3
billion) upgrading Jiangsu's network over the next three years.
	   Mr Shi said the company would continue to look for opportunities
to strengthen its telecommunications business on the mainland.
	   ``We will focus on enlarging our customer base in China, to
improve our service quality as well as increasing our efficiency
and profitability,'' said Mr Shi.
	   China Telecom provides cell phone services in Guangdong and
Zhejiang provinces.
	   China Telecom stocks rose $0.30 to $13.60 yesterday.
	   There have been sporadic rumours in the local market that Cable
 Wireless, the parent company of Hongkong Telecom, might forge a
tactical alliance with China Telecom so it or Hongkong Telecom
could eventually gain entry into the lucrative telecoms market on
the mainland.
	   China's telecoms industry remains closed to foreign investors,
but there are growing indications that the authorities might
eventually liberalise it.

Jockey Willie Ryan gets last-minute mount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ If reigning English Derby winning jockey
Willie Ryan believes in coincidences, then he will start the 1998
classic Saturday exuding confidence.
	   Last year's winner did not even have a mount until Thursday when
he was unexpectedly named to ride the Aidan O'Brien-trained
Saratoga Springs.
	   The same thing happened last year when Ryan was a late call-up
to ride Benny The Dip, which _ like Saratoga Springs _ had won the
Dante Stakes at York.
	   Before learning he had a mount for Saturday, Ryan was
philosophical about last year's achievement.
	   ``It was a great day and it is something that will always live
with you,'' he said. ``It's a race that every jockey wants to win _
obviously it is something I would like to do again.''
	   Prior to his 1997 victory, Ryan had only three previous rides in
the Derby and was thrown off Foyer in the race in 1994.
	   He was chosen for Saratoga Springs ahead of Christy Roche, who
rode Second Empire to third place in the Irish 2,000 Guineas last
month.
	   Roche, who won the 1984 Derby on Secreto, is O'Brien's
first-choice jockey in Ireland but does not ride for the trainer in
England.
	   The center of attention in England's most famous flat race
continues to be Cape Verdi, who is attempting to become the first
filly since 1916 to win the Derby.
	   And there's another piece of history in the offing.
	   For the first time since 1917, the winner of the 1,000 Guineas
(Cape Verdi) will face the 2,000 Guineas winner (King of Kings) in
the Derby.
	   The only withdrawal Thursday was Pegnitz, a long-shot, reducing
the field to 15.
	   Saratoga Springs was an unexpected starter, the least-favored of
three horses in the Derby trained by Irishman O'Brien. But Ryan
will not be perturbed by his last minute call for the race.
	   Last year he was third in line to ride Benny The Dip, stepping
in when Frankie Dettori and Olivier Peslier withdrew. He rode a
memorable race at Epsom, kicking for home early in the straight and
just beating Silver Patriarch by a short head.
	   Second Empire is the betting favorite for Saturday, ahead of
Greek Dance. Other strongly backed starters are Gulland, City
Honors and Courteous.

THE number of property agents in Hong Kong has shrunk 30 to 40

<TEXT>
per cent following the collapse in property prices and the sharp
drop in the number of transactions.
	   The Society of Estate Agents yesterday said the number of estate
agents is now down from 30,000 last year to only 17,000 at present.
	   Its chairman, Louisa Shum, warned yesterday the industry faces
further decimation if a proposed law on property agents is passed.
	   The bill, she claimed would lead to the collapse of more estate
agencies.
	   ``There were a lot of new practice regulations in this Bill of
Agency Law that would make the estate agency difficult to
operate,'' said Ms Shum.
	   She hopes that the government could give estate agents a
transitional period to adjust their operations to fulfil those
requirements of the Bill of Agency Law.
	   ``I also hope that the government could reduce the resources
burden that is imposed on the estate agencies by the bill,'' she
said.
	   Ms Shum said as the Bill of Agency Law requires estate agencies
to disclose more information and to provide training for their
salespeople, this would impose an extra burden on the estates
agencies during this difficult time.
	   She said property agents' woes are twofold.
	   ``First of all, the total number of transactions per month
dropped from more than 10,000 to 4,000,'' said Ms Shum.
	   The Land Registry yesterday said property transactions last
month dived 51.2 per cent compared to the same period last year.
	   The registry said there were only 9,640 registered agreements
for sales and purchases of building units last month, with a total
value of $30.57 billion.
	   The figure is a 13.6 per cent drop from April this year.
	   The value of transactions, however, fell only about 6.9 per
cent.
	   Ms Shum said that as a large proportion of estate agents' income
depends on commission, the drop in transactions has severely dented
income.
	   ``Secondly, many estate agencies have collapsed or reduced their
number of branches during this difficult time, leading to layoffs
among estate agents,'' said Ms Shum.
	   The current property market, she said, cannot support a large
number of estate agents.
	   She said the measures announced by Financial Secretary Sir
Donald Tsang last Friday would be helpful to the industry but added
she was unsure how effective they would be.

Calypso heads for La Rochelle as museum
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with officials saying Giuliani not likely to attend  
  By YVES GAUBERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LA ROCHELLE, France (AP) _ Its name is almost as famous as its
captain, making its last voyage without its master but with a new
mission.
	   After navigating the globe with undersea explorer Jacques
Cousteau, the damaged Calypso was expected to arrive on a barge
Friday in this French Atlantic port to be transformed into a marine
museum.
	   Cousteau's widow Francine and La Rochelle's Deputy Mayor Michel
Crepeau were to greet the ship, itself a star of ``The Undersea
World of Jacques Cousteau'' TV documentaries.
	   After sinking in the port of Singapore in January 1996, the ship
was no longer seaworthy. It was loaded on a barge May 28 in
Marseille to make the trip around Spain and up the French coast to
La Rochelle.
	   After arriving Friday, the ship was to be placed in the water
and towed Sunday afternoon into a port in the center of town.
	   New York, Paris and La Rochelle were candidates to adopt the
vessel. But the La Rochelle Maritime Museum was chosen to host the
Calypso, with construction plans for a 5 million-franc (dlrs
830,000) museum.
	   Built in 1942 in Seattle, Washington, the 42-meter (137-foot)
ship was first a minesweeper named the JB.26. Given to Great
Britain, it was sent to Malta and renamed the Calypso. Cousteau
acquired the ship in 1954.
	   Cousteau, who died last June, had been criticized in a recent
report with faking some scenes in his documentaries. But Sir Peter
Blake, the current head of the Cousteau Society, defended him last
month.
	   Cousteau might have been responsible for some indiscretions
because nobody was ``lily white,'' but his aims were ``totally
pure,'' Blake said.
	   Blake also said the allegations could have come from some of
Cousteau's former crew members, who were unhappy with past
treatment.
	   During the weekend event, the Cousteau Society was to award
Crepeau and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for their work toward
environmental protection.
	   La Rochelle officials said earlier that Giuliani was expected to
attend, but they later said the mayor was not likely to come. New
York City officials said Giuliani was not expected to visit France
this week.

Pakistan will later this month test an advanced version of its

<TEXT>
medium range nuclear capable Ghauri missile, news reports said here
Tuesday.''The 1,500 kilometres range of Ghauri ballistic missile
has been enhanced to 1,700 km,'' The Nation newspaper reported,
quoting unnamed officials.''Initial tests to increase this range to
2,500 kilometres have proved successful and the missile's new
capabilities will be tested by June end,'' the officials said. The
newspaper did not say when the tests had been carried out.The
report claimed that the test later this month would be a ``unique''
one in which the Ghauri would be fitted with a nuclear warhead and
fired to an altitude of 2,000 metres.
	   ``The warhead will require no fuel,'' it said, adding that to
record the test, a satellite would be hired. The test is reportedly
aimed at collecting data for vertical flight of the missile and
transportation of the warhead to its target.''Liquid fuel has been
used in Ghauri and positive results have been achieved to convert
this type of missile fuel into solid fuel,'' the report
said.Pakistan first tested the Ghauri in April, which officials say
can strike most major Indian cities. Top scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer
Khan said last week Pakistan intended to equip the missile with
nuclear warheads.With the mass production of the medium-range
Ghauri, Pakistan, the officials say, has entered the exclusive club
of the few countries that have missile production capability.
	   The leader of the team of scientists that masterminded
Pakistan's six nuclear tests last week, Dr Samar Mubarak, said
Monday Pakistan would push ahead with its sophisticated long-range
missile programme.Mubarak said Pakistan's Shaheen II (Eagle)
missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead 2,000 kilometres
(1,250 miles) would be ready for a test flight within a year.He
also said the Shaheen I missile, with a range of 700 kilometres
(435 miles) and the ability to carry nuclear weapons, could be
tested within days.''It has been mounted on a launching pad and
awaits the go-ahead from the government,'' Mubarak, a scientist at
the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, claimed.A US missile expert
is of the view that Pakistan's missile technology is superior to
India's, US Under Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has admitted
that Pakistan has been ``relatively more responsible'' than India
in its behaviour on nuclear proliferation matters.
	   Replying to a question, if the Pakistani bomb was an ``Islamic
bomb,'' he lauded Pakistan's responsible behaviour and said
Islamabad had neither sold nor transferred its nuclear technology
to any other Islamic country. He was talking to the NBC Monday
night.''(Pakistan Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharif had made this
decision under political pressure including from the parliamentary
opposition. He also highlighted the factor that India is the
proliferation-trigger country in the region,'' Talbott said.Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Tuesday the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council had begun meeting at
expert level to prepare for ministerial talks on the India-Pakistan
nuclear crisis. Foreign ministers of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France and China--the world's five official nuclear
powers-will meet on Thursday in Geneva to weigh responses to
controversial nuclear test explosions by arch-rivals India and
Pakistan conducted last month.
	   'One feels the general desire to reach some adequate measures
with respect to the situation, in order to avert the danger posed
by this problem,'' Primakov told reporters after a speech in
Switzerland, speaking through an interpreter. He said China, which
will chair the so-called p5 meeting, had recommended that experts
from each country hold preparatory discussions in Geneva and these
meetings were already under way. 'Our experts have arrived, they
are already in Geneva.'' Asked how the big powers might prod India
and Pakistan to join the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, Primakov
said: ``I think both countries also are making certain steps in
this direction. Statements to that effect have already been made,
and will be made.'' Russian officials said similar efforts were
likely to get both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. In his speech to a group of Swiss business and community
officials, Primakov said other nuclear powers had learned to
co-exist with their weapons, managing their differences without
resorting to atomic war.

Report: Japanese panel calls for building 20 nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Thursday in lead  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A government panel recommended on Thursday that
Japan build about 20 more nuclear power plants by 2010 to reduce
its reliance on fossil fuels and slash carbon dioxide emissions, a
news report said.
	   The plants would raise the ratio of nuclear power in the
country's power supply to 45 percent in 2010 from 34.6 percent in
1996, the Electricity Utility Industry Council said in an interim
report, according to Kyodo News.
	   Twenty additional plants would also cut carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants by 9 percent from 1990 levels, Kyodo quoted the
council as saying. Japan now has 51 nuclear power plants.
	   The council made the proposal on the assumption that power
consumption will grow at an average annual pace of 1.2 percent to
167 billion kilowatt-hours in 2010, Kyodo said.
	   The pace of growth in power consumption is about half the tempo
previously envisaged for the period, according to the report.
	   The council could not be reached late Thursday for comment.
	   The recommendations come as trust in Japan's nuclear industry
has fallen in recent years following a series of accidents and
cover-ups by operators. Local areas are increasingly reluctant to
have plants built in their neighborhoods.
	   A fire in March 1997 exposed 37 workers to low-level radiation
at a nuclear power plant on the Sea of Japan. There also was a
major leak at a prototype reactor that uses plutonium at a site
northeast of Tokyo.
	   The council said carbon dioxide emissions will increase
substantially by 2010 from 1990 levels unless Japan builds the
proposed 20 nuclear power plants or contains the pace of growth in
power consumption.

Supreme Court upholds sentence of three for killing Briton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian Supreme Court on Thursday
upheld a lower court ruling in a case involving three men found
guilty of manslaughter and robbery after beating to death a British
clergyman and badly injuring his wife.
	   Anglican Clergyman Michael Trevor Pollard, 63, died after being
beaten up near Nyiregyhaza, 160 kilometers (100 miles) from
Budapest, on Aug. 4, 1997. His wife, Valerie Jo Pollard, 55,
suffered serious jaw injuries.
	   The courtroom Thursday was the scene of a dramatic meeting
between Mrs. Pollard and the parents of Istvan Dudas, a 19-year-old
bricklayer, who received 11 years in prison.
	   ``I wish this had never happened, I, too, am a mother,'' Mrs.
Pollard told Mrs. Dudas, who was sobbing.
	   ``I pray for you all,'' Mrs. Pollard said.
	   Two other men, Attila Bilecz, a 23-year-old driver, and Laszlo
Mester, 23, an unemployed cobbler, had their seven-year and
six-year sentences upheld.
	   ``I think justice is being served,'' Mrs. Pollard told The
Associated Press. ``I know they have to be punished, but I really
feel for their poor parents.''
	   The British couple were on their way to Romania with charity
gifts for children in August last year. They stopped for the night
in a remote place, not knowing they parked in a no parking zone.
	   Dudas and Bilecz spotted them and, pretending to be policemen,
fined them for illegal parking.
	   However, the robbers were not content with the 4,000 forint
(dlrs 20) fine collected and returned twice to beat and rob the
foreigners.
	   Pollard died from blood entering his lungs, and his wife was
beaten unconscious.

JAKARTA (JP): Immigration officers have arrested eight

<TEXT>
foreigners at several places in Central Jakarta in the past week
for violating immigration permits, according to an official.
	   Immigration Director of Foreigners Control Coordination Zaiman
Nurmatias said Tuesday the suspects were from Ghana, Morocco, South
Korea, Zimbabwe, the Netherlands and Bangladesh.
	   ``They were apprehended on different days from May 28 until
Tuesday,'' he said.
	   Zaiman did not explain whether the foreigners were netted in a
special operation or by plainclothes officers.
	   According to him, a suspect identified as Bovali Said from
Morocco was netted on May 28 while withdrawing money from a BCA
automated teller machine at the Djakarta Theater building.
	   During initial examination, the Moroccan claimed to be
Indonesian and a resident of Bogor as stated on his identification
card, he said.
	   ``However, he could not locate his precise residence,'' Zaiman
said.
	   The man could not sing the national anthem nor recite the tenets
of state ideology Pancasila, he added.
	   The suspect later claimed to be a player of Surabaya-based
Assyabaab Salim Group soccer club and produced a letter signed by
an officer from the All Indonesian Soccer Federation (PSSI), Dali
Tahir.
	   The letter stated that Bovali, a former junior soccer player in
Morocco, was a playing team member of the Indonesian soccer league.
	   But the immigration office has enough evidence to charge him for
allegedly counterfeiting his identification card, said Zaiman.
	   He gave no details about the arrest of the other seven suspects.

CITIC Pacific disappointed the market yesterday by announcing

<TEXT>
that it has been unable to reach an agreement with CLP Holdings on
the joint venture acquisition of infrastructure projects in China.
	   But chairman of Citic Pacific, Larry Yung, yesterday urged
investors to remain patient as the group's negotiations with CLP
relating to potential joint venture power projects we continuing.
	   Earlier, he said that he expected a deal to be signed with CLP
Holdings by this month.
	   But he said yesterday that the talks over joint acquisitions
with CLP Holdings were not expected to be finalised until the end
of this month.
	   Deputy managing director of Citic Pacific Henry Fan said the two
companies would need more time before an agreement could be
reached.
	   He said this was not a delay as talks were continuing.
	   ``I don't think any commitment was made that any announcement
would be made at the end of June,'' he said.
	   Mr Yung said both Citic Pacific and CLP had their own strengths
in China's power sector.
	   Citic Pacific, which has a 20 per cent stake in CLP Holdings,
invested in five power plant projects in China.
	   Mr Yung said that before the acquisition of the 20 per cent
stake, the group had made investments in several mainland power
projects which have proven to be first class investments in terms
of yield and profit contribution.
	   Contributions from Hong Kong and mainland power businesses would
account for more than 30 per cent of Citic Pacific's total profits
in 1998 and next year, according to Mr Yung.
	   He also said the group had no intention of selling its power
plant projects to CLP or to other investors.
	   ``Citic has no need at this point to consider the sale of
first-class assets to any party,'' he said.
	   The group's investments in the power sector contributed about 22
per cent of the company's total earnings before exceptional gains
in 1997.
	   Mr Yung suggested that the group would continue its focus on
infrastructure projects.
	   Chairman increases stake in firmCITIC Pacific chairman Larry
Yung has increased his stake in the company by 3 percentage points.
	   ``I increased my stake in Citic Pacific because I found the
price was right. In the future, if the price is right, I will
continue to buy more,'' Mr Yung said. He said his last purchase was
on 28 May, when he bought two million shares in the company at
$18.1 each or for a total consideration of $36.2 million.
	   This raised his stake to 18.67 per cent from 18.58 per cent,
according to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
	   Citic Pacific's parent company Citic Hong Kong (Holdings) has
also increased its stake in the company _ to 29.52 per cent from
29.36 per cent.
	   In mid-May, Citic purchased 3.47 million shares on the market.
	   Analysts said that while the stock is trading at about nine
times 1998 earnings, they are not surprised to see the management
buy back shares from the market as the price has dropped to a very
low level.

NATO experts arrive in Macedonia to evaluate conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ With violence raging in neighboring
Serbia's Kosovo province, a 40-member team of NATO experts arrived
Thursday in Macedonia to evaluate conditions for a possible
Alliance presence there.
	   ``This is only a visit to evaluate technical conditions while a
NATO presence would depend on the U.N. Security Council's decision
...,'' Macedonian Defense Minister Lazar Kitanoski told reporters.
	   The NATO team will stay in Macedonia several days, examining
communications facilities for a NATO presence and view a military
facility where a NATO Partnership for Peace exercise is to take
place in September.
	   NATO ministers agreed last week on increased cooperation to help
Albania and Macedonia patrol their borders and on joint exercises
with forces from the two Balkan nations.
	   On Wednesday, U.N. chief Kofi Annan recommended that the 750
U.N. peacekeepers stay in Macedonia until at least February and
raised the possibility of more soldiers heading to the region.
	   The current U.N. mission was scheduled to leave Macedonia by
September. The peacekeepers were sent there in 1992 to the prevent
the Bosnian war from spilling over into Macedonia.
	   NATO commander for Northwestern Europe, Marshal Sir John
Cheshire, told reporters in Skopje that the Partnership for Peace
military exercise in Macedonia would be one of the largest in the
region.
	   Twenty-four countries, eleven of them NATO members, with a total
of 700 soldiers are due to participate in the exercise at the
Krivolak military facility, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of
Macedonia's capital Skopje,
	   ``I will be talking with my military colleagues here and I need
to see the training area,'' Cheshire said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ England's controversial midfielder Paul Gascoigne,
cut for the World Cup team by coach Glenn Hoddle because he was out
of shape, may have missed the tournament anyway with a fractured
cheekbone.
	   The tabloid Sun said Gascoigne was examined Wednesday at a
private clinic, where the injury was confirmed.
	   Gascoigne led England to the semifinals of the 1990 World Cup
but has been frequently injured since then. He's also been
criticized for an erratic personal life that's included
hard-drinking and late-night carousing with celebrity friends.
	   Reporters Thursday spotted Gascoigne, his estranged wife Sheryl
and their son catching a flight for the United States.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Travelers arriving in Paris for the World Cup are
greeted by two familiar sights as they enter the capital from the
north.
	   To the right, gleaming white atop Montmarte, is Sacre Coeur, the
Roman Catholic basilica visited by millions of worshippers and
tourists each year.
	   To the left, sweating in the yellow and purple, is Kobe Bryant,
the young star of the Los Angeles Lakers, taking up the side of a
building in an advertising mural for Adidas.
	   In the bumper-to-bumper traffic that usually clogs the
expressways in that area, the 26-meter(80-foot)-high Bryant is
harder to miss that Sacre Coeur.

	   LONDON (AP) _ An anonymous British gambler has placed a 20,000
pound (dlrs 32,200) bet on Brazil to win the World Cup at odds of
3-1.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ World Cup-bound South Korea played to
a 1-1 draw against China Thursday in a tough warm-up match in which
one of its key players was carried off the field with injury.
	   Star forward Hwang Sun-hong was stretchered off after colliding
with the Chinese 'keeper in the 20th minute. South Korean coach Cha
Bum-keun said Hwang was under treatment in hospital for a knee
injury but refused to five further details.
	   Midfielder Lee Sang-yoon scored South Korea's goal in the 16th
minute and China's Ma Mingyu equalized in the 52nd.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Broadcasting Corporation's TV coverage
of the World Cup in Britain is being threatened by a strike by
technicians.
	   Union members have already taken some BBC news programs off the
air with a 24-hour stoppage over job losses and further industrial
action is planned when the World Cup kicks off June 10, when
Scotland faces defending titlist Brazil.
	   ``The six French broadcasting unions have pledged their
support,'' said Gerry Morrissey, official of the union Bectu.
``There is no question that we can take these matches off the air
with French support.''

	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Though he misses the World Cup because
of knee surgery, Gary McAllister hasn't written off Scotland's
chances of beating defending champion Brazil in next Wednesday's
opener.
	   But he feels the Scots' chances of making the second round for
the first time in eight attempts, hang on the second game against
Norway.
	   ``We have certainly got a chance of causing a wee upset in the
opening game, but Norway is the one for us, I feel,'' said
McAllister, who would have been Scotland's captain if he had been
fit.
	   The Scots will be slight favorites against Morocco, so it could
come down to the June 16 match in Bordeaux against Norway.
	   ``They are a very direct side, but if we can beat them it will
go a long way towards us qualifying,'' said the Coventry
midfielder. ``I think Scotland need to go and get three points
against Norway, which is maybe not the case against Brazil.''

JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso vowed yesterday to

<TEXT>
remove collusion, corruption, cronyism and nepotism from the city
administration.
	   ``What must be done first is to reform the mentality of our
staff. Everybody must go through a period of introspection,'' he
said.
	   ``I've briefed all the mayors. The next step is to talk to all
district heads,'' the governor said.
	   However, Sutiyoso's vow drew harsh criticism from two senior
city councilors, who insisted that it was the governor himself who
needed to be introspective if collusion and nepotism in his office
really were to be brought to an end.
	   Saud Rachman from the United Development Party (PPP) faction
said Sutiyoso must first reflect on whether or not he was a product
of the practices himself.
	   There is strong evidence that Sutiyoso's success in the
gubernatorial election was engineered, he said.
	   ``Our faction was instructed by city council speaker Edy Waluyo
to vote for Sutiyoso,'' Saud said.
	   ``Edy told us at a meeting in this room (the faction's meeting
room): 'To achieve harmony and stability in the city administration
we needed to speak with the same voice. That means that we have to
vote for Sutiyoso,''' he added.
	   He said Edy might have said this under pressure from even higher
ranking officials.
	   ``We proposed three candidates for the election: Surjadi
Soedirdja (Sutiyoso's predecessor), Hendro Priyono (now Minister of
Transmigration and Resettlement of Forest Nomads) and Sutiyoso,''
he said.
	   Head of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) faction Lukman F.
Mokoginta said yesterday that his faction had never been put under
pressure to choose Sutiyoso.
	   ``I had to vote for him because he was the only candidate left.
My faction originally proposed Surjadi Soedirdja, Hendro Priyono,
Sutiyoso and M. Ritonga (former city council speaker),'' he said.
	   ``But Surjadi, Hendro and Ritonga all resigned before voting
took place leaving me with no choice but to vote for Sutiyoso,'' he
said.
	   According to existing regulations, all city council factions
must consult the minister of home affairs over their choice of
candidates, he added.
	   ``The minister (then Yogie S. Memed) did not encourage us to
vote for Sutiyoso. He only told us to go on with our plans,'' he
added.
	   After other names proposed by the factions were removed, two
candidates endorsed by the Ministry of Home Affairs ran against
Sutiyoso in the election last October. The two candidates were
Tubagus Rais, a former deputy governor for economic and development
affairs, and Achmadi, who formerly lead the Golkar faction in the
council.
	   Saud said the two other candidates were only included to make
the election appear fair.
	   ``Their names were included in the voting so that Sutiyoso would
not be the only choice. It was a ploy to make the election look
democratic,'' Saud said.
	   He said Sutiyoso won 62 votes. Rais received five votes and
Achmadi eight.
	   ``I can tell you now that to follow the speaker's instruction,
our faction actually arranged for a few people to vote for Rais and
Achmadi to make the count look more natural,'' Saud said.
	   He said that he was not asking Sutiyoso to step down, even
though he thought that collusion had helped the governor into
office.
	   ``But if he does resign, it would show that he is a person of
impeccable integrity,'' Saud said.
	   Head of the Armed Forces faction Sumekar did not comment on Saud
and Lukman's allegations, but said he would back Sutiyoso in his
bid to eradicate malfeasance within the administration.
	   Fatommy Asaari, head of the Golkar faction, refused to say if
his faction was instructed to vote for Sutiyoso.
	   ``That is strictly my faction's business,'' he retorted. (cst)

Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday ruled out a

<TEXT>
resumption of nuclear testing by Beijing, a Chinese government
source said.''China has no intention of resuming nuclear testing,''
the source, who declined to be identified, quoted Jiang as saying
in an exclusive interview with a foreign news organisation.No
further details were immediately available.Comments by a senior
Chinese Foreign Ministry official onMonday had raised questions
about China's position on testing following blasts by India and
Pakistan last month.
	   The Foreign Ministry official had been asked at a news briefing
whether China might resume its own testing programme, which it
agreed to halt in 1996 by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).''I cannot respond to your question directly,'' said the
foreign ministry official, who also declined to be identified.The
official noted a provision in the CTBT that allowed signatories to
opt out if they believed their ``supreme national interests'' were
threatened.''I'm not indicating China will do this,'' he said.
``But let me tell you honestly we have to take into account this
development.''I'm not frightening anyone,'' he added. The foreign
ministry official also said Beijing was ``damned serious'' about
making the CTBT work.
	   ``China is very careful about what it says. What we say is what
we mean,'' the official said. Neither India nor Pakistan has signed
the CTBT, which prohibits underground nuclear testing. China is
alarmed that a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan could
spread further and threaten its security.It has gone out of its way
to stress cooperation with the United States over the crisis in
South Asia ahead of a summit this month in Beijing between Jiang
and US President Bill Clinton.The official Chinese media revealed
that Clinton and Jiang discussed the nuclear crisis during their
first use of a newly-installed telephone ``hot line''.One Western
diplomat said he did not believe China ever intended to give the
impression it was ready to resume nuclear testing.
	   But China would not stick by the CTBT indefinitely if India and
Pakistan continued tit-for-tat testing and other countries joined
them, he said. ``If the CTBT becomes unstable, China would be the
first off,'' the diplomat said. ``If others start testing, they
would back out.''India enraged China by citing a threat from its
giant neighbour to justify its atomic explosions, and diplomats
said China was anxious to rally support for a hard line against New
Delhi.Beijing has made clear it expects New Delhi to make the first
move to repair the damage to relations.China detonated its last
nuclear device in 1996, shortly before joining the CTBT. On
Thursday China will host a meeting of foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council to try to formulate a
response to the nuclear crisis.One outcome of the Geneva meeting
may be pressure on Pakistan and India to join the CTBT.

CHINESE Estates bought back its shares on the market on Tuesday

<TEXT>
when the Hang Seng index took a sharp 3.61 per cent tumble.
	   The move is believed to be the first time the company bought its
shares in the market. It follows a shock announcement recently that
it had incurred a $2.26 billion loss from provisions from
securities trading last year, together with a 27 per cent reduction
in net profits to $916.6 million.
	   The loss was followed by another shock disclosure, that Chinese
Estates chairman Joseph Lau Luen-hung had reduced his stake in the
group before the results announcement.
	   A stock exchange statement showed that Chinese Estates bought
back 748,000 shares on Tuesday at prices between $1.80 and $1.72
per share, costing about $1.2 million.
	   Chinese Estates was among 15 firms which repurchased shares on
Tuesday, spending a total of $52 million.
	   Henderson Land Development also repurchased 360,000 shares at
prices which ranged from $25.9 to $26, representing an outlay of at
least $9 million.
	   Another developer, Kerry Properties, bought back 25,000 shares
at a price of $7 per share.
	   Other firms which repurchased shares on Tuesday were: Asia
Standard, CCT Telecom, CLP Holdings, Cosmopolitan International,
Gold-Face Holdings, Great Wall, Jackin International, Kingmaker,
Lee Hing, Liu Chong Hing, Min Xin and Shangri-La Asia.

Palestinian court orders release of Hamas spokesman

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian Supreme Court
ordered the release Thursday of the Hamas spokesman, jailed since
April after he made statements critical of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's government.
	   Abdel Aziz Rantisi was charged with endangering national
security, but Judge Jamil Ashi ordered him released because of lack
of evidence, Rantisi's lawyer Iyad Alami told The Associated Press.
	   Rantisi remained in custody Thursday evening and Alami said the
order is ``still under implementation.'' He said, however, that he
expected his client's release soon.
	   Palestinian security forces usually ignore court orders and keep
detainees in custody until their release is approved by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who is under pressure from Israel and the
United States to crack down on militant groups such as Hamas.
	   Rantisi was arrested after he blamed the Palestinian Authority
and several high-ranking Palestinian officials and security chiefs
for collaborating with Israel in the March 29 death of Hamas
bombmaker Mohiyadine Sharif.
	   Sharif was found dead March 29 at the scene of a car explosion
in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hamas accused Israel and the
Palestinian Authority of collaborating in the death, but a
Palestinian Authority investigation concluded that Sharif was the
victim of a power struggle within Hamas.

JAKARTA (JP): Five police members were netted along with 61

<TEXT>
civilians in two separated operations against touts offering their
services to applicants of driver's licenses and other vehicle
documents yesterday.
	   Capt. Monto Sutardjo of the Jakarta Police Internal Affairs
unit, which carried out the operation, told reporters yesterday
that the suspects, including a woman, were caught red-handed while
trying to collect money from the public.
	   ``None of them realized they were being carefully watched by
internal police officers.
	   The first group of 23 people were netted at the city police
driver's license administration office in Muara Angke, West
Jakarta.
	   The second group of 43 were captured at the vehicle
administration unit at the city police headquarters on Jl. Gatot
Subroto in South Jakarta.
	   As in many operations against touts, all the suspects were
released in the evening after signing forms stating they would not
commit the same offense again.
	   ``If they are netted again, we'll bring them to court,'' Monto
said.
	   Monto's predecessor made the same threat many times over the
years, but most touts operating in the city police complex are
reportedly the same people. (edt)

JAKARTA (JP): Central Jakarta District Court adjourned Tuesday

<TEXT>
the trial of four activists charged with conducting an illegal
demonstration on Jl. Thamrin on March 9 because of the absence of
the activists' lawyers.
	   Presiding judge I.G.N. Putra apologized to the defendants --
Kuldip Singh, Widi Wahyu, Wandy Nicodemus Tuturoong and Farah Diba
Agustine -- for delaying the opening of the trial.
	   ``Please forgive me. It's not my intention to hinder the
trial,'' Putra said when he opened the trial at 2:30 p.m.
	   Putra then adjourned the trial until today since the defendants
refused to continue the hearing without the presence of their
lawyers.
	   Trimedya Panjaitan, one of the students' lawyers, said the
lawyers decided to leave the court because the panel of judges
apparently did not take the trial seriously.
	   He said the lawyers arrived at the court at 10 a.m., but the
court had not been called to order by 1 p.m.
	   ``The judges were apparently offended by our comments that they
were ignoring the growing reform movement and were still part of
the old regime,'' Trimedya said.
	   He said the judges were also offended when parents of the
activists sent a letter demanding that the trial be stopped. (jun)

Seven Hong Kong political parties agreed on Wednesday to join

<TEXT>
forces on economic and social issues in the first real opposition
to the Beijing-backed administration of Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa.The parties, a mix of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy
groups, agreed to push proposals to confront a sharp economic slump
and to ease rising unemployment. The decision to rally together
around social issues could spell trouble for Tung, whose
administration is struggling with a severe economic downturn. ``We
certainly hope the government will seriously consider and agree to
this consensus, because it is difficult for us, for all the
parties, to agree on something,'' Liberal Party leader Allen Lee,
who chaired the meeting, told a news conference.
	   ``We are more or less the majority in the legislature, and we
will push for these proposals to get through,'' said Lee.The
parties control about 41 seats in the newly elected 60-seat
legislature. Tung and his officials set policies but a united
opposition could force trade-offs before endorsing his bills,
analysts said.Hong Kong is facing its worst economic crisis in
years, with a host of businesses closing.On Friday the government
announced a 2.0 percent contraction in the economy in the first
quarter, the first such shrinkage in gross domestic product in 13
years. And Hong Kong Monetary Authority boss Joseph Yam said during
a trip to London on Tuesday that second quarter GDP could contract
as well--confirming a recession.
	   With unemployment at a 14-year high of 3.9 percent, Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang presided over a new task force on
unemployment on Wednesday.He told a news conference later at least
100,000 jobs would be created over the next 1-1/2 years by measures
announced last week. But the parties meeting on Wednesday appeared
to want more.Their proposals included bringing forward
infrastructure projects, civil engineering projects and social
services to increase employment opportunities.They also proposed
scrapping provisional tax and slashing fuel tax, although Tsang
last week ruled out any tax cuts as he said local taxes were
competitive.
	   The parties proposed cutting property rates, charges for public
utilities and retail rentals payable to the government.''If these
polices should result in a deficit in the budget next year, we will
support the budget deficit,'' Lee said. Hong Kong habitually runs a
prudent budget, avoiding deficits.''Now there's a rainstorm out
there. The government should provide us with umbrellas,'' Lee said.
``We have a rich government but poor citizens and a poor business
operating environment.''The parties are sharing ideas on fixing the
economy but are unlikely to work together on political issues,
especially on the pace of democracy or relations with Beijing.
	   The Democratic Party, which won the largest popular vote in
May's election, the Frontier group and the Citizens Party have
called for direct elections for all 60 legislative seats.All three
have called repeatedly for mainland China to adopt democratic
reforms and criticised the leadership in Beijing.The Liberal Party,
the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance and the Democratic Alliance for
the Betterment of Hong Kong are all staunchly pro-Beijing and back
a slow road to full democracy.

inspector, Richard Butler, report on the arms inspection program.

A MASSIVE exceptional loss of more than $500 million has sent DC

<TEXT>
Finance (Holdings) into the red, the company reported in its annual
results yesterday.
	   The company said it suffered an exceptional loss of $539.7
million as it made provisions for bad debts and investments that
have gone sour amid Asia's financial turmoil.
	   This resulted in the investment holding company posting a net
loss of $398 million last year against a net profit of $188 million
in 1996.
	   The loss was higher than $361.1 million forecast in The Estimate
Directory.
	   The exceptional loss was made up of $174 million in provisions
for loan and interest receivables, $199.6 million in deficits on
revaluation of investment properties, $182.9 million in provisions
for diminuation in the value of listed investments and a profit of
$16.8 million from the disposal of subsidiaries.
	   The dismal result comes after DC Finance suffered heavily from
the slump in Hong Kong's stock and property markets.
	   The nature of the principal activities and the asset portfolio
of the group mainly comprises of property investments, listed
securities trading and secured loan receivables in both Hong Kong
and on the mainland.
	   The group's turnover soared 182.3 per cent to $756 million from
1996's $264 million.
	   The total operating loss stood at $394.2 million over a profit
of $184 million in 1996.
	   Loss per share amounted to 19.15 cents against earnings of 10.49
cents.
	   No final dividend was recommended by the board of directors for
the year.
	   This month, Irison Development, which holds 43.16 per cent of DC
Finance, said that it was in the early stages of talks with locally
listed Tung Fong Hung Properties (TFHP) over the sale of a
substantial part of its stake.
	   The price per share is expected to be around $0.4-$0.5.
	   DC Finance is also at an early stage of talks with TFHP over the
acquisition of properties from the company.
	   DC Finance is considering raising funds through a rights issue
or a placement of new shares to increase its capital base and
working capital. Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp
(Gitic) holds a 18.57 per cent stake in DC Finance.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government has awarded a contract to
build a 270-kilometer (170-mile) pipeline from Jordan to north
Egypt to the U.S. company AMOCO.
	   Marwan Dudin, head of the regional authority in Aqaba, where the
dlrs 400 million pipeline will start, said Thursday that a
memorandum of understanding has been signed with AMOCO.
	   The pipeline will carry natural gas from the fields in the Nile
Delta across the Sinai and under the Red Sea to Aqaba.
	   Dudin said the gas will be used to generate electricity,
replacing the diesel and fuel oil currently consumed by Jordan's
power stations. The substitution will ultimately reduce the
country's oil consumption.
	   AMOCO's vice president, Bruce Ericson, said that in a second
project, the pipeline will continue 350 kilometers (220 miles) from
Aqaba to Amman and neighboring cities.
	   The contract for the second phase has not yet been awarded.
	   Ericson said the pipeline will transport 200 million cubic feet
(6 million cubic meters) of natural gas a day, starting in 2001.
The flow will gradually increase to 300 million cubic feet (9
million cubic meters) by 2006.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Bahrain Telecommunications Co. has
awarded two contracts worth a total of 9.2 million dinars (dlrs 24
million) to Sweden's E" system from
its current capacity of 80,000 lines to 150,000, the newspaper
said.
	   The expansion will be implemented in three phases and should be
completed in October 1999, the newspaper said.
	   The other contract was awarded to Ericsson Telecoms to install
transit switches in two areas that handle traffic between the
various mobile exchanges. The project will be completed by November
1999, the Tribune added.
	   The company, better known as Batelco, has said it plans to
invest some 30 million dinars (dlrs 79 million) this year on
expansion.
	   Batelco, which runs a monopoly on the island, is 20 percent
owned by Britain's Cable  Wireless and 36 percent by the Bahraini
government. The remaining shares are listed on the Bahrain Stock
Exchange.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government is studying proposals from
Russian and British-Dutch firms to exploit oil shale deposits in
southern Jordan, the ministry of energy said Thursday.
	   A ministry official said a Russian firm plans to extract 350,000
tons of oil a year by using a new distillation technique to extract
oil from shale at ``costs lower than the current market cost.''
	   The British-Dutch Shell Co., however, plans an initial
production capacity of 5,110 tons (5,621 short tons) a day. This
will rise to 511,000 a day on completion of another oil shale
plant.
	   He said the Jordanian government has sent oil shale samples to
several countries in order to find a cost-effective extraction.
	   The oil shale deposits lie in the desert between the Dead Sea
and the Red Sea port of Aqaba. They are estimated at 40 billion
tons, of which energy officials say 10 percent is oil.
	   Jordan has no known oil reserves. It imports its daily
requirement of 85,000 barrels of oil and fuel oil from Iraq.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped on the Jordanian stock
exchange this week, but turnover increased slightly, a market
report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the decline to a fall in share prices blamed
on a shortage of cash and the stalemate in the Middle East peace
talks.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 2.99 percent to 174.90 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks slipped by 3.78 percent, industrial
firms by 1.82 percent, the services sector by 0.49 percent. But
shares of insurance companies increased by 0.79 percent.
	   Turnover also increased by 28.6 percent to 6.3 million dinars
(dlrs 8.8 million), the report said.
	   It said shares of 89 firms were traded.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
continued to slip this week, closing at 2,184.8 points, down 28.6
points, or 1.26 percent from last week, The National Industries Co.
said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said it seemed the market will
not pick up until the government implements measures intended to
stimulate trade.
	   Officials have been talking about such steps, including opening
the exchange to non-nationals, but nothing has materialized.
	   Some 248.67 million shares were traded this week, 3.11 percent
lower than last week's 256.66 million. The value of these shares
rose 8.19 percent to 72.79 million dinars (dlrs 237.87 million).
Last week, it was 67.28 million dinars (dlrs 219.86 million).
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, five closed higher,
35 closed lower, and the shares of 34 companies were unchanged. The
rest were not traded.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The chairman of Merril Lynch
International toured the war-wrecked downtown of Beirut Thursday
and met Lebanon's prime minister.
	   ``I must say that I am very impressed with what is occurring
here in Lebanon ... We see nothing but a positive opportunity for
our business,'' Winthrop Smith told reporters after a meeting with
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, himself a billionaire tycoon and
architect of the country's reconstruction from the 1975-90 civil
war.
	   Smith also visited Solidere, the biggest company in charge of
rebuilding downtown Beirut.
	   He said his team gained a ``very positive'' impression of the
development program and the growth of the economy.
	   Merril Lynch International, a Wall Street investment firm, has
been operating in Lebanon for 36 years. It was the lead manager of
a dlrs 100 million Eurobond issue last year to help Lebanon finance
the rebuilding of its electricity network.
	   The company is also expected to supervise a planned dlrs 1
billion Eurobond issue to finance development projects in Lebanon.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Italian news agency ANSA has moved
its Middle East regional bureau to Beirut, 12 years after fleeing a
city plunged in the chaos of war.
	   ``ANSA is back because we have trust in Lebanon,'' ANSA's Middle
East bureau chief, Furio Morroni, told a news conference Wednesday
night.
	   ANSA, like other news agencies and foreign companies, moved
regional offices from Beirut as the Lebanese capital became a haven
for kidnappers and rival gunmen who fought over territory during
the 1975-90 conflict.
	   Many companies have returned to Beirut since the civil war,
encouraged by its multibillion dollar reconstruction program and by
the government's newfound authority.
	   ANSA, which moved its regional offices to Nicosia, Cyprus, in
1986, maintained an office in Beirut during the war but without
Italian staff.

JAKARTA (JP): More than 500 employees of private retail company

<TEXT>
PT Multipolar Perkasa visited the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute
yesterday to seek legal advise over their employment status.
	   They demanded that the company, which operates Wal-Mart stores
in Pluit, North Jakarta, and Karawaci, Tangerang, give them
severance pay in line with government regulations on the dismissal
of workers.
	   The employees' spokeswoman Rika S. Miranti said that 1,600
employees had lost their jobs after the company closed both stores
following massive riots on May 14.
	   Wal-Mart in Karawaci was damaged but the outlet located in Mega
Mall Pluit was left unscathed by the looting mobs.
	   ``We've asked the company to clarify our status and give us the
appropriate severance pay if it intends to dismiss us,'' Rika said.
	   She said employees' representatives had tried without success to
arrange a meeting with company executives.
	   In an earlier informal meeting, company executive Agus
Mardiyanto urged employees to resign due to the bad performance of
the company, she said.
	   She explained that employees had threatened to hold a big
demonstration at the company's head office at Gedung Menara
Matahari, Karawaci, tomorrow to demand that company president Jefry
Wongsono clarify their status.
	   Dozens of suppliers also visited the institute's office
yesterday to seek help in reclaiming debts totaling Rp 16 billion
owed to them by the giant retailer.
	   Susan, who used to deal with Wal-Mart, said the company had
stopped paying its suppliers last November on the grounds that it
was involved in a dispute with Wal-Mart Inc. of the United States.
	   ``We don't care about the dispute. We want payment. Most of us
are just small-scale suppliers,'' she said.
	   The suppliers said they would join the employees' planned
demonstration.
	   Multipolar, a subsidiary of the Lippo Group, is suing Wal-Mart
and its expatriate executives for losses worth US$98.8 million
which were allegedly caused by improper business conduct.
	   The plaintiff alleges that Wal-Mart mismanaged a joint venture
to open two Wal-Mart stores in Indonesia, manipulated data and
issued misleading budgets.
	   Wal-Mart has in turn accused Multipolar of violating their
agreement by purchasing shares in PT Matahari Putra Prima, a rival
retailer. (jun)

HULU Langat MP Badrul Hisham Abdul Aziz and Balakong State

<TEXT>
Assemblyman Hoh Hee Lee have called on the Selangor State
Development Corporation not to close the road linking Taman Sri
Melor and Sungai Chua.
	   Badrul said the road should remain open or the corporation
should provide an alternative exit to Sungai Chua.
	   This was despite the fact that the construction of a permanent
road was the responsibility of the developer of Taman Sri Melor, a
joint-venture between the Selangor State Secretariat Incorporated
(SSI) and a private company.
	   He said PKNS had also informed him that a permanent road for
Section 7 of Bandar Baru Bangi, which is adjacent to Taman Sri
Melor and Taman Sri Intan, will be built by the end of the year.
	   He said PKNS should be able to make adjustments to the road link
between Taman Sri Melor and Sungai Chua.
	   Badrul said under the Section 7 project, a concrete bridge would
also be built to replace the wooden bridge linking Taman Sri Intan
with Persiaran Bangi and Jalan Reko.
	   The road will link Taman Sri Melor and Taman Sri Intan to Bandar
Baru Bangi and Jalan Sungai Chua.
	   Taman Sri Melor, which has about 240 houses, only has a
temporary certificate of fitness from the Kajang Municipal Council.
	   Badrul said this when asked to comment on the PKNS's decision to
postpone the closure of the road between Taman Sri Melor and Sungai
Chua.
	   Meanwhile, Hoh said residents in Sungai Chua and housing estates
in Jalan Wan Siew used the road between Sungai Chua and Taman Sri
Melor as an alternative route to Bandar Baru Bangi and Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia.
	   He said residents might have to travel a longer route via Kajang
town to Bandar Baru Bangi if the road was closed.
	   He said besides causing inconvenience to motorists, this would
also cause traffic congestion in Kajang town.
	   A PKNS spokesman said the road linking Taman Sri Melor and
Sungai Chua would be closed later this month.
	   He said the road ran through PKNS land which had been set aside
for low- cost housing. Work on the project began earlier this year.

THE privatisation of knitwear manufacturer and property investor

<TEXT>
Laws International Holdings received the go-ahead from shareholders
yesterday.
	   The company has been listed for 11 years.
	   The controlling shareholder Kandos Investments made a general
offer for the shares of the company on 15 April.
	   Kandos board said the Law family already holds about 68.1 per
cent interest in three companies, namely Kandos, Venus Co and
Venus's subsidiary Superfance as of 4 May.
	   Under a general offer, shareholders can sell their shares at
$1.38 per share, seven per cent above the closing price of $1.29 on
Monday, before yesterday's suspension.
	   The majority owners plan to withdraw the listing on 29 June.
	   The shares will trade for the last time on the stock exchange on
19 June.
	   The board aims to expand its offshore production activities in
expectation of ``new challenges'' like the expiry of the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement by the year 2004.
	   The company described the agreement as protection for the local
garment industry, which faces limited growth and rising costs, to a
certain extent.
	   ``Such expansion will involve substantial amounts of capital
expenditure . . . .the group will be in a better and more flexible
position to implement such expansion as a group of private
companies with the full support of the Law family,'' Kandos
Investments' board of directors said.
	   Laws International saw a 28.6 per cent rise in net profit to
$121.7 million in the six months ended 19 December last year.
	   The company's garment business was started by Law Ting-pong and
his family in 1953, followed by the incorporation of Laws Fashion
Knitters in 1975.
	   It was listed in April 1987 and later switched its domicile to
Bermuda under the present name of Laws International Holdings. It
later demerged its property and garment business.

Foreign lenders and cash-strapped Indonesians strike deal over debt
</HEADLINE>
  With Indonesia-Economic Minister; Indonesia-IMF

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Foreign lenders and the
representatives of Indonesia's government and corporate sector
announced a three-point program Thursday to address Indonesia's
external debt problems.
	   The parties released a joint statement in Frankfurt following
four days of talks. Details of the plan were simultaneously
released in Jakarta, where the government hailed it as a major
breakthrough in its attempts to deal with the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been the
hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown. Many of its largest
companies and banks are technically insolvent because of a dramatic
dive of around 80 percent in the value of the currency, the rupiah.
	   The crisis has disrupted production and trade, and has triggered
soaring inflation and mass unemployment. Social unrest climaxed
last month when riots and protests preceded the resignation of
former President Suharto, ending his 32-year authoritarian grip on
power.
	   The statement said the program addresses three main categories
of debt: private corporate debt, bank debt, and trade finance.
	   Under the first category, up to dlrs 60 billion in corporate
debt will be handled by an Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency, to
be known as INDRA.
	   The agency will start operations Aug. 1 and will protect debtors
from exchange rate risks. It will also ensure that foreign exchange
remains available to private debtors who agree with their creditors
to restructure their external debt for a period of eight years,
with three years of grace during which time no principal will be
payable.
	   Participation in INDRA will be voluntary.
	   Under the second category, extensions of up to four years will
be granted to maturities of an estimated dlrs 9.2 billion of
external, non-trade related debt, owed by Indonesia's commercial
banks due any time before March 31, 1999.
	   The third category covers about dlrs 4.4 billion of trade
financing agreements. Under the deal, Indonesia will request trade
creditors to Indonesian banks to maintain trade finance for a
period of one year at levels existing at the end of April 1998.
	   In Jakarta, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economy and
Finance Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the deal between Indonesia and
the banks ``demonstrate both support for and long-term confidence
in the Indonesian economy.''
	   The 13 banks involved in the negotiations were: ABN Amro, Bank
of America, Banque National de Paris, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, The
Korean Development Bank, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp., Sanwa
Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Sumitomo Bank.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday he

<TEXT>
saw ``no problem'' with a change in leadership after his nation had
resolved its currency crisis.Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years,
told Reuters Television in an interview in Tokyo: ``What is
important is a smooth transition, and it is my hope that I can turn
over the reins of government and party and will hand over the
whole.''Asked if the transfer of power could come next year,
Mahathir said it could come ``any time at all'', but added
Malaysia's first goal was to resolve its currency crisis.''What we
are going to do first is to resolve this problem and if we can
resolve this problem, there will be no problem about this
transfer,'' he said.Mahathir, 72, has been prime minister of the
Southeast Asian nation since 1981.
	   He has named his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, as the person who would
replace him when he eventually steps aside.Although there have been
open differences between the two leaders on how to steer the
country and the economy, Anwar has waited patiently for the
premiership since his elevation to deputy prime minister in
1993.The resignation of former Indonesian president Suharto last
month threw a spotlight on Mahathir, now Asia's longest serving
elected leader.But analysts agree that Mahathir and Anwar, 50,
coexist comfortably and the prime minister remains clearly in
charge.They also say that although the opposition has been
emboldened by Malaysia's economic difficulties, they remain a small
minority in the lower house of parliament, where they hold only 25
of 192 seats.
	   Mahathir said in the interview that his health problems were not
seriously affecting his capacity to work. Late last month he
underwent a minor operation to remove a blood clot in his left
ankle after he accidentally kicked a stone on the eve of his
departure for an official visit to Egypt and Sudan. ``It's not
going to affect my capacity to work in any serious way,'' he
said.Mahathir, a frequent critic of ``market forces'' and currency
speculators, said Malaysia's economy could recover ``if we are left
alone to take corrective measures''. An unexpected contraction of
Malaysia's economy in the first quarter, Mahathir said, did not
presage a downturn for the full year. ``I'm concerned because of
the uncertainty. But the fact that there was a contraction in the
first quarter really doesn't mean there will be a similar
performance for the whole year,'' he said.
	   ``We can quite easily recover.'' But he added that there were
``factors beyond our control which are trying to force us to go,
quite literally, into recession. We can't really foresee what
so-called market forces will do. They have their own yardstick.''
Gross domestic product shrank 1.8 percent in the January-March
quarter from the same period last year, the central bank said on
Saturday. It was the first quarterly contraction since 1985 and
stoked concerns that the economy was heading into recession, widely
defined as back-to-back quarters of negative GDP growth.Mahathir
also said Malaysia had begun talking to a lot of other countries
about a currency basket that would not peg Malaysia's currency to
any single currency.Asked if that meant a key role for the yen, he
said: ``Of course our trade with Japan is very big...so we must use
the yen and benefit from the yen's slide.
	   ``Mahathir reiterated his call for lower interest rates, but
explained that he was referring to the ``effective interest rate'',
which includes charges by banks to cover their cost of capital and
is therefore above the central bank's lending rate. Noting that the
effective interest rate was now about 15 percent or 16 percent,
Mahathir said: ``If it goes back to what is charged by the central
bank, about 10 or 11 percent, we'll have no problems.''''Despite
lower interest rates, we can maintain inflation at a reasonable
level,'' Mahathir added. ``Only imported inflation is a
problem--domestic inflation is not a problem.''Mahathir also said
the government would initially take about a 60 percent equity stake
in a special agency to be set up to take over the troubled assets
of banks and would ``welcome'' foreign participation of 20 percent
to 30 percent.Mahathir was in Tokyo to attend economic symposiums
and was expected to meet Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on
Thursday. He was scheduled to leave on Friday.

JAKARTA (JP): Hundreds of striking bus drivers of the state-run

<TEXT>
PPD bus company gave a rousing welcome yesterday to released labor
union chairman Muchtar Pakpahan as he paid them an impromptu visit.
	   Drivers said it was the first time the leader of the Indonesian
Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI), released from prison on May 25, was
in their midst. Many claimed membership in his union.
	   Muchtar, who arrived at noon with his secretary-general Sunarti
in a hastily arranged addition to his hectic schedule, was greeted
with cries of ``Long live Pakpahan!''. Drivers had gathered since
morning at PPD headquarters on Jl. Permata, Halim Perdanakusuma in
East Jakarta.
	   Muchtar disappeared in the throng of drivers trying to get close
to him. They eventually quieted down as he addressed them.
	   Drivers are striking over a demand that wages be in line with
regulations of state-run companies.
	   ``Some of us who have worked for more than 10 years and still
receive a monthly wage of about Rp 150,000,'' one driver said.
	   ``A colleague received Rp 25,000 in retirement money after 25
years of service,'' another added.
	   Banners proclaimed their demands for a stop to corruption in the
company and investigation of their pension and health insurance
schemes.
	   ``Tomorrow we will bring our wives and children if necessary,''
a driver said. They planned to spend the night at the facility
unless Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris gave them a satisfactory
answer.
	   Muchtar met with PPD director Dwi Wahyono and employee
representatives, including the company's SBSI branch chairman
Godfried Aritonang.
	   Wahyono, who became director in 1996, said he was ``honored'' to
meet Muchtar.
	   He said the management was trying to eradicate various causes of
chronic losses.
	   As a result of the measures, he said losses were reduced from Rp
29.7 billion in 1996 to Rp 18 billion in 1997. One resort was
through ending nonprofitable partnerships.
	   A management source said one of the terminated partnerships was
with Humpuss, the business group owned by Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala
Putra, former president Soeharto's youngest son. The cooperation
involved the renovation of double-deckers.
	   ``I know that your losses are also influenced by outside
parties,'' Muchtar said.
	   He cited a concept drawn up by SBSI three years ago, that
monthly wages could be at least Rp 600,000 for drivers while the
company could still profit. ``That was when the rupiah was around
2,500 to the (U.S.) dollar,'' he said.
	   He told drivers that the union could work with management to
stop corruption and inefficiency, but drivers should do their part
to save the company and make it profitable.
	   ``I support your wish if you want to stay here,'' Muchtar said
after drivers rejected his suggestion to go home and leave matters
to their representatives.
	   ``As long as you promise to safeguard against any destruction
and maintain your health.''
	   He also told drivers and management that SBSI was no longer
banned. ``There is no reason anymore on the part of the company to
reject SBSI unions.''
	   On Monday, SBSI, set up in 1992, was officially registered as a
union. Previously, the only government-sanctioned union was the
Federasi SPSI, the All-Indonesia Workers Union Federation.
	   ``Hardly any of us are (FSPSI) members,'' a driver said. (anr)

SHUN Tak Holdings yesterday said its Belcher Gardens residential

<TEXT>
and commercial project would benefit from a new government measure
extending the pre-sale period of unfinished flats.
	   The measure extends the pre-sale period from 15 to 20 months
before the completion date.
	   Shun Tak executive chairman Stanley Ho said at the company's
annual meeting that the measure would allow the company to bring
forward the pre-sale date for the first phase of Belcher Gardens in
Pok Fu Lam.
	   Belcher Gardens is Hong Kong island's largest new residential
development before the end of the century. It is comprised of 2,250
luxury units and a shopping mall of about 215,000 square feet.
	   Mr Ho said Shun Tak was scheduled to launch the first phase of
the project to the market in February next year.
	   He said the company's property division was expected to
contribute significantly to earnings growth in the next few years.
	   Executive director Daisy Ho said the total development costs for
Belcher Gardens reached $5,000 to $6,000 per square foot, with land
costs accounting for $2,200 per sq ft.
	   Ms Ho said the first phase of the development was comprised of
about 1,000 residential units in three residential towers which
were scheduled to be completed by mid-2000.
	   Another Shun Tak project at 124 Pok Fu Lam Road was also
progressing well and was scheduled for completion by mid-1999, she
said.
	   The Lands Department approved a high-rise residential
development proposal at the site, with a lease modification to
remove height limits last September.
	   The complex is comprised of 10 duplex apartments, each measuring
more than 3,000 sq ft.

Multidrug-resistant TB emerging worldwide
</HEADLINE>
  By DANIEL Q. HANEY  
  AP Medical Editor  

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to
front-line antibiotics are emerging around the world and are
especially common in parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   A survey of 35 countries, sponsored by the World Health
Organization, found that while multidrug resistance is still
generally rare, a few countries have significant problems.
	   TB has re-emerged as a significant health problem in recent
years, in part because people with AIDS are especially susceptible
to the disease. Using drugs improperly to treat TB can quickly
promote the evolution of bacteria that are impervious to these
medicines.
	   The problem gained attention in the early 1990s in New York
City, where about 7 percent of new TB cases were found to be
resistant to more than one drug.
	   ``Clearly, compared to what happened in New York City, the
situation is not as bad for most countries. But there are many hot
spots around the world,'' said Dr. Ariel Pablos-Mendez of Columbia
University, chief author of the WHO study.
	   Pablos-Mendez said the researchers were especially glad to find
multidrug-resistant TB is still rare in Africa, where AIDS is a
health crisis.
	   The study was conducted between 1994 and 1997. The findings were
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
	   Worldwide, 1.4 percent of TB bacteria were found to be resistant
to more than one of four common drugs used to treat the disease:
isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and stroptomycin.
	   The highest rate of multidrug resistance was found in Latvia,
where 14.4 percent of samples could withstand more than one drug.
Other countries with high rates were Estonia, 10.2 percent; the
Dominican Republic, 6.6 percent; Argentina, 4.6 percent; Russia, 4
percent, and Thailand, 3.8 percent.
	   In the United States, 1.6 percent of the 13,511 samples tested
were multidrug resistant.
	   Countries where less than 1 percent of TB bacteria were
multidrug-resistant were Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Cuba, France,
Kenya, Lesotho, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain and Swaziland.
	   The survey also found that 10 percent of TB bacteria worldwide
are resistant to at least one medicine. The rate of single-drug
resistance ranged from 2 percent in the Czech Republic to 41
percent in the Dominican Republic.
	   ``These findings should be of great concern to all those who
seek to decrease the global burden of tuberculosis,'' concluded an
editorial by Drs. Dixie E. Snider Jr. and Kenneth G. Castro of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
	   While the reasons for the high rate of resistance vary from
country to country, they generally involve patients' failure to
take their medicine as directed.
	   Typically, TB patients are prescribed four antibiotics for two
months, then two antibiotics for an additional two months.
Resistance is likely to emerge if patients don't get all of the
drugs or they stop taking them.
	   In New York City, officials virtually eliminated
multidrug-resistant TB by sending health workers every day to visit
patients and watch them swallow their medicines.

	   The 19km stretch has been lighted up since May last year.
	   She said the lighting up of the entire expressway, costing RM18

Mass copying at examination halls seems to have crossed one more

<TEXT>
threshold and become an organised activity with its own logistics,
network and ancillary. This is the impression one gains from
newspaper reports about HSC examination centres in Mymensingh and
Netrokona. According to one report filed from Mymensingh and
published in a Bengali Daily of Dhaka, houses and shops behind an
examination centre have been turned into copying centres. Youths
are either cutting pages off a book or making hand-written copies
and supplying them to the examination centre, with the active help
and participation of elders, with teachers gladly acquiescing.
	   The police too were found abetting in this far-from-legitimate
operation, despite the fact that in at least one centre police and
examinees clashed. And copy supplying' was an operation in which
members of both BCL and JCD were found taking part, undisturbed,
for a while, by their political difference. Local political bosses
were seen stationed within the examination centres. It all looked
as if some great community endeavour was on.What is particularly
disturbing is not that unfair means is being resorted to on a wider
scale and with greater impunity; what deals the rudest shock is
that the sense of guilt, the covertness and illegitimacy, the moral
opprobrium that has so long accompanied such dubious activity, is
now vanishing.
	   Copying is not only tolerated but aided by elders. The moral
bankruptcy is as good as complete. In this situation it is useless
to punish the errant examinees. The evil has struck too deep and
what is more, the values of society are being torpedoed. Will the
authorities act, with the thoroughness and decisiveness that is
demanded? In desperation some quarters are even thinking of
abolishing the SSC and HSC examinations as they are held under the
boards. The certificate issued by institutions will be alternatives
to HSC/SSC certificates and the result of admission tests will be
an assessment of merit. When all the rules and norms are being so
cynically pilloried, abolition of SSC/HSC may be a risky
experiment. Even if abolition has merits, it should not be chosen
in the context of defeatism resulting from the authorities'
inability to control copying.

JAKARTA (JP): Former cabinet minister Siswono Yudohusodo and

<TEXT>
Moslem leader Amien Rais have warned of the dangers of national
disintegration --even suggesting that Indonesia could become a
second Yugoslavia -- if political differences continue to escalate.
	   Siswono and Amien separately spoke about the need for people to
firmly hold onto state ideology Pancasila, and to exercise
self-restraint in handling differences.
	   Speaking in Yogyakarta, Amien said Indonesia was now facing
severe economic and political crises which, unless dealt with
wisely, could plunge the nation into disintegration. ``It's not
impossible that what happened to Yugoslavia could also happen to
Indonesia,'' he said.
	   ``This is why all parties need to check their egotism, and rein
in their lust for power,'' he said. ``We all need to exercise
self-restraint and avoid conflict.''
	   Speaking at a discussion held by an association of Christian
students here yesterday, Siswono said the emergence of new
political parties following the resignation of former president
Soeharto should be handled carefully so as not to cause the nation
to disintegrate.
	   He attributed the burgeoning of new political parties -- despite
existing laws recognizing only three -- to the inability of the
existing Golkar, United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) to accommodate people's aspirations.
	   ``The three political organizations are not able to accommodate
the various aspirations,'' Siswono was quoted by Antara as saying.
	   He used as an example of the inability of the existing parties
to anticipate people's aspirations, the instance of the People's
Consultative Assembly agreeing in March to reelect former president
Soeharto, but less than two months later waves of people expressed
their rejection of the 77-year-old president.
	   Asked how people should go about using the new freedom to
establish their own parties without endangering national unity,
Siswono said: ``In this situation, we need to even strengthen our
spirit for national unity.''
	   Other speakers at the discussion were political observer
Muhammad A.S. Hikam and legal expert Dimyati Hartono.
	   Meanwhile, politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas said in Yogyakarta
on Tuesday that the government did not need to limit the number of
political parties. ``Indonesia is a pluralistic county, which is
why a system that recognizes many parties is absolutely needed to
accommodate various aspirations,'' he said.
	   ``Let the people decide on how many parties they want. If
necessary, let people establish a community party because it, too,
would be protected by chapter 28 of the 1945 Constitution,'' he
said.
	   ``In a multiparty system, what's needed is a limit on the number
of parties, but whether any of them qualify for financial
assistance from the government...'' he said.
	   Bintang, who was only recently released from prison after
serving time for slandering former president Soeharto, is also
chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Union Party (PUDI) which was
not recognized under Soeharto's administration.
	   Separately, the chairman of Central Java chapter of Nahdlatul
Ulama, Noer Iskandar al-Barsany, recommended yesterday that members
of Indonesia's largest Moslem organization establish their own
party.
	   He said that 30 branches of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) in the
provinces agreed that the 30-million-strong organization should
have its own party, and that they would urge the central executive
board to take concrete steps regarding the matter.
	   Nahdlatul Ulama chairman Abdurrahman Wahid reiterated recently
that the organization would not turn into a political party, but
would not forbid members from political activities. They should,
however, wait for a directive from the leadership board.

A BULL market could tempt a number of companies to deviate from

<TEXT>
their original intentions once their initial public offering (IPO)
is over, a top official of Cosco (Hong Kong) Group said.
	   Gordon Kwong, executive director and vice chairman of Cosco
(Hong Kong), yesterday told a seminar on ``Post Listing Issues _
Challenges and Opportunities'' that for scores of companies,
discipline in treasury management might not be a top priority after
an IPO issue is over.
	   ``To some it may even be more important to keep a close watch on
how the company's share price is doing and to do whatever necessary
to keep it up,'' Mr Kwong said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in the past few years has taken
disciplinary action in a number of cases for breach of undertaking
by directors.
	   It is management's responsibility to monitor the company's
operations continuously and to develop and pursue appropriate
strategies to ensure satisfactory growth and returns to the
shareholders, he added.
	   Mr Kwong said a company should keep its shareholders informed as
to whether it can achieve its profit forecast for the year.
	   He said a number of companies fell foul of the listing rules
unwittingly, but that ignorance was no excuse.
	   ``Very often by seeking timely professional advice these
breaches could have been avoided,'' Mr Kwong said.
	   He said a newly listed company should implement a sound
management information system.
	   A newly listed company should also implement an effective
financial internal control and fund management system.
	   Mr Kwong said, the company should design a corporate structure
that promotes a culture of openness and team work.

LINGKARAN Trans Kota Holdings Berhad will build alternative

<TEXT>
routes to ensure that Puchong Intan and Puchong Indah residents do
not have to pay toll at the Puchong West toll plaza along the
Damansara-Puchong Highway.
	   This assurance came from Serdang MP Datuk Yap Pian Hon who said
yesterday that the routes were important to residents who were
average wage-earners.
	   ``My only concern is that I do not want residents living around
the area to pay toll. It is not fair to ask them to do so as the
toll plaza is very near their homes,'' he told reporters after
briefing residents on the roads.
	   He said the roads will only be used by residents living in the
surrounding area.
	   Litrak operations general manager Amran Amir said those
travelling from Puchong to Shah Alam can use either one of two
alternative roads on the southern section of the highway.
	   Those travelling from Shah Alam to Puchong can use a 1.3km
northern alternative road.
	   He said Litrak was experiencing difficulties in building the
alternative roads as illegal houses were hampering the construction
of the northern stretch.
	   The northern stretch will be built on Drainage and Irrigation
Department land near Sungai Klang.
	   ``The JPS has given us approval to construct the 1.3km road and
the only problem we are facing is that of illegal houses in the
area.
	   ``When we planned the project last year, there were no illegal
houses in that area. But when we were about to start the
construction, there were so many.''
	   Amran said the company had approached the Subang Jaya Municipal
Council on the matter but to no avail.
	   He said the council had not taken any action to remove the
houses.
	   On the southern alternative roads, he said one of them was a new
road that would be built through Kampung Tun Razak while the other
was an existing road in the village.
	   ``We are trying to convince villagers to allow us to build the
300-metre road through two houses. If they refuse, we will look for
another road or upgrade existing roads,'' he added.

Victims still buried in smashed train; officials say at least 100

dead  
  Eds: UPDATES with report that a car may have derailed some distance
before crash

  By TONY CZUCZKA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Using cranes, jackhammers and cutting
torches, hundreds of workers searched Thursday through shattered
passenger cars and beneath a collapsed bridge for bodies crushed
and buried when Germany's swiftest train jumped the tracks.
	   At least 100 people died when the lead locomotive of
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 broke loose at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning, leaving behind 12 passenger
cars and a second locomotive that careened off the tracks and
crunched together like an accordion.
	   The weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper reported Thursday that
experts from the federal railroad office found signs that one of
the coaches derailed about six kilometers (3.7 miles) before the
train reached the overpass.
	   The coach was dragged along the rail bed until it came to a
turnout near the overpass where it swung sideways, the newspaper
said.
	   Spokesmen for the Celle district and the emergency teams said
they had no information on the report, and the federal railway
office had no comment.
	   With few clues to the cause of the disaster, Deutsche Bahn
officials ordered all InterCity Express trains to slow to a maximum
160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour until all 100 high-speed trains
in service can be inspected. The 3,500-kilometers (2,175-mile)
system is designed for top speeds of 280 kilometers (175 miles) an
hour.
	   Rescue workers expected to recover more bodies from a
first-class car and a dining car still wedged beneath the arching
ruins of the overpass at Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Hanover.
	   ``We think the chances of finding further survivors are very
small,'' police spokesman Peter Hoppe said.
	   The four parallel tracks were strewn with stray wheels, shards
of metal and other debris _ much of it the result of rescuers
cutting and smashing their way into the mangled hulks of train
cars.
	   Some of Eschede's 4,000 residents brought blankets for
survivors, others opened their homes to anxious relatives of
missing passengers, and handed out coffee and food to exhausted
rescue workers.
	   ``How could we know that this horrible thing would happen in
this beautiful place?'' said Bernd Schlawer, 45, who recalled
taking a bike ride with five of his children across the overpass
two days earlier.
	   Ninety bodies were recovered so far and two more people died in
the hospital. Lower Saxony state officials said 100 people had been
killed and 200 people were injured; 95 had been treated in
hospitals for serious injuries, according to police.
	   Twenty-four hours after the accident, there was no authoritative
count of how many people were on board the train, or how many might
have walked away from the crash. The search for the dead and the
hope of survivors took precedence over the investigation of the
cause.
	   ``There is no indication that the derailment was anything other
than an accident,'' police spokesman Hoppe said.
	   The tragedy, the worst on Germany's rails since World War II,
sent the nation into mourning _ and into action. Flags flew at
half-staff at all public buildings on Thursday and rail workers
wore black ribbons. As news of the crash spread, people rushed to
donate blood at Red Cross centers throughout the country, in some
cases leaving work earlier or lining up for hours at some centers.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, clearly shaken by the scope of the
calamity, cut short a trip to Italy, visiting the disaster scene
Thursday afternoon. He pledged 1 million marks (dlrs 550,000) in
government aid, matching contributions of a million marks each from
the Lower Saxony state government and the railway.
	   ``The goal must be to identify the bodies as quickly as
possible,'' Kohl said, adding that he hoped ``that most of the
seriously injured have the chance to survive.''
	   Photos of the scene showed that five cars got through the
overpass before derailing. Still pushed by the rear engine, the
others jumped the tracks, slammed against the concrete supports of
the overpass and jackknifed.
	   Oblivious to the catastrophe, the driver of the lead locomotive
continued through Eschede until the station master engaged the
emergency brake.
	   Deutsche Bahn executive Peter Muenschwander confirmed that two
workers who had been doing signal maintenance on an adjacent track
were missing and presumed dead. Their car was crushed beneath the
debris; it was unclear whether it had been parked along the tracks
or on the overpass.
	   At the accident site, a red crane hoisted a severed train car
from the overpass early Thursday so workers with jackhammers would
pull apart the overpass to reach the crushed cars beneath.
	   Other cranes lifted bodies on stretchers to doctors, who
unzipped the plastic body bags to confirm the victims were dead.
The bodies were transferred to a morgue in Hanover.
	   Residents living along the tracks heard a loud explosion and a
horrible crushing sound.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Hannelore Domkewitz, who was peeling potatoes at her kitchen window
when she saw the train speed by just before the crash.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle before the accident.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said. ``Thank
God, it came to a standstill.''
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the deadliest since World War II.
	   The ICE _ which connects all major German cities at speeds up to
280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour _ suffered its only other
serious accident during the first year of operation when a train
killed six track workers who did not hear it coming.

In a pre-budget interview with this newspaper, the President of

<TEXT>
the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry opined that
while Bangladesh offers a better and more liberal policy regime to
attract foreign investment ``compared to India and other countries
of the region,'' corrupt bureaucracy and inadequate infrastructure
was impeding investment. He also suggested that for encouraging
savings and industrial expansion, the government should refrain
from imposing any new taxes in the new budget. Domestically, he
complained that industrial growth in many sectors had declined.On
the other hand, he said that Bangladesh has a lot of business
goodwill abroad, and intending transnational and individual foreign
investors are impressed by the fact that Bangladesh is free from
the scourge of political or religious extremism.
	   He was optimistic that there would be adequate response from
potential investors, local and foreign, if the government decided
to privatise all state-owned enterprises. He recommended wholesale
privatisation, and with the money obtained from the sale, he
suggested creation of special funds for the development of human
resources on the one hand and on the other, for the support of
faltering private enterprises as is bound to happen in a developing
economy. He identified rent-seeking bureaucracy and corruption as
the most obstructive evil hampering enterprise and opined that
streamlining the administration by cutting down the oversized
bureaucracy would doubly benefit the country by saving revenue
expenditure and minimising bureaucratic interference in private
sector growth.Indeed growth of the private sector and industrial
enterprise will also in turn help in down-sizing the bloated limbs
of government services.
	   Increased scope of re-employment in the private sector will make
it easy for excess manpower in government employment to accept
redundancy. Reduction of public employment is, however, an
interdependent process contingent on socio-political factors which
the government may have to weigh as to timing and costs, both
material and psychological. The process of privatisation, on the
other hand, should pose no such problem and the FICCI
recommendation in this regard deserves consideration.

SEMARANG (JP): The Ministry of Education and Culture has

<TEXT>
abolished the requirement for university students to attend
Pancasila propagation (P4) courses in the 1998/1999 academic year.
	   Director for Student Affairs Soedarmadi said here yesterday that
the efficacy and necessity of the program, a mandatory requirement
for university entrants, would be re-evaluated.
	   ``The decision has been taken because the program's method and
substance are currently being reevaluated,'' Soedarmadi told
reporters.
	   He said the ministry had sent a letter to all rectors informing
them of the decision.
	   However he asserted that the Pancasila subject would still be
included as part of the curriculum, but now students are will not
be asked the Pancasila propagation course as a prerequisite for
graduation.
	   Soedarmadi added that the ministry was now looking into the
possibility of integrating the elements of the propagation and
upgrading course be incorporated into the Pancasila subjects taken
by the students.
	   A number of universities have reportedly decided to stop
teaching the propagation course under their own initiative,
including Indonesian Islamic University in Yogyakarta.
	   Secretary General of the Association of Indonesian Mentors
Mungin Edy Wibowo expressed his support for the decision and said
the course was sheer indoctrination and a complete waste of
resources.
	   ``It is really nothing more than a a waste of money because all
students, from junior high school to university, study the same
material,'' Mungin, who also lectures at Semarang Teachers Training
Institute, said.
	   He contended that funds for the course could be more useful if
channeled into student extra-curricular activities and the
procurement of educational materials.
	   Mungin said that Pancasila should be retained as subject matter
in universities, but urged that it be taught in a more
philosophically oriented course.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch aired objections to the course
last week and called on the government to abolish it.
	   The course was introduced in 1984 by the late minister of
education and culture Nugroho Notosusanto. It takes up the first
two weeks of the student initiation period.
	   A special body exists to oversee the propagation of Pancasila.
	   The Agency for Pancasila Propagation has been repeatedly advised
to invigorate the course methodology, which features hours of dry
lectures.
	   There is a widely held perception among the public at large that
the propagation courses are generally boring and uninspiring.
	   Indonesians in all spheres of life, from Junior High School
students to senior government officials, are obliged to take the
course. (har)

FINANCIAL Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said yesterday

<TEXT>
that the high interest rate was not a matter for the government to
thrash out as it was determined by banks.
	   Last Friday the prime rate, as determined by the Hong Kong
Association of Banks, was at 10 per cent.
	   Sir Donald said earlier this year that the interest rate could
not be used to regulate the economy.
	   To reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations on
homeowners, Sir Donald said he was determined to develop, through
the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation, a mechanism to encourage banks
to provide housing loans at fixed interest rates.
	   Despite suggestions by local banks that another interest rate
reduction is unlikely in the future, some analysts believe public
pressure will eventually lead to at least another quarter of a
percentage point cut by mid-year.
	   In March this year, the Hong Kong Association of Banks announced
that banks would trim their deposit saving rates by 25 basis points
to 5.25 per cent, the first reduction in two years.

Albania worries about Serb incursion across border; seeks aid
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with official warning of risk of Serb
incursion  
  With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo  
  By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top Albanian official sounded a warning
Thursday about the possibility of Serb forces coming across the
border to pursue their offensive against Kosovo rebels.
	   ``We except everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
said Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano.
	   The Albanian government, worried about both the crush of
refugees and a new threat for its strapped military, is pushing for
Western troops to shore up its northern border.
	   ``The Serbian soldiers won't stop the violence and the
bloodshed. It's really not logical thinking that the situation is
going to be more calm,'' Prela told The Associated Press.
	   ``The conflict may be extended to Albania. And then it will be
extremely grave. That is the reason that the Albanian government
asked NATO to deploy troops in the north of the country.''
	   Unable to cope with the estimated 12,000 Kosovo refugees who
have arrived so far, Nano also has asked NATO for humanitarian aid.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' he said in a letter sent to NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana late Wednesday and released Thursday.
	   Nano urged that NATO provide medicines and food in the north.
	   About 12,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from the Serb offensive in
secessionist Kosovo have arrived since last weekend, Interior
Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhja said. Thousands of others are
believed to be trying to join them.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano stressed.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lifes and the peace in Kosovo,'' he told Solana.
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the border town where most have arrived.

JAKARTA (JP): University of Indonesia medical students have

<TEXT>
given Minister of Health F.A. Moeloek one week to announce measures
to totally reform the country's healthcare system or resign.
	   ``If the minister fails to do this, we will ask him respectfully
to resign in order to protect the interests of the people,''
Sugisman, spokesman for the medical students, said at a free speech
forum yesterday.
	   The gathering criticized the government for placing an unfair
burden on those who required medical treatment by failing to
guarantee the availability of affordable medicine, and for paying
scant attention to ``the right to a healthy life.''
	   Sugisman, as quoted by Antara, said that rampant corruption,
collusion and nepotism in the Ministry of Health had resulted in
inefficiency and the mismanagement of funds and had caused the
price of medical care to rise.
	   Minister Moeloek, who was also in the gathering and wore a
headband written with ``Reform in Health'', welcomed the call and
said he would be ready to resign if he failed to launch reform in
his ministry.
	   He identified a number of priority areas, including securing the
availability of generic and essential medicines, and formula milk
for infants and children, for at least two years.
	   Moeloek, who is also a professor in the medical school at
University of Indonesia, said the ministry had opened a special
postal address, Post Box 5500, to receive complaints from the
public about irregularities in the ministry's operations.
	   ``All complaints will be followed up on,'' he promised at the
gathering which was also attended by ministry secretary-general
Hidayat Hardjoprawito and inspector-general Roesmono.
	   The students were the second group to demand reform in the
health sector. On Monday, a group of doctors and non-governmental
organization (NGO) activists demonstrated against the poor policies
which have caused medicines to rise in price.
	   The group also alleged that the Yayasan Harapan Kita foundation
had ``looted'' Harapan Kita Maternity Hospital and Cardiac Hospital
Harapan Kita on regular basis.
	   The foundation -- established by Ibu Tien Soeharto, the late
wife of former president Soeharto -- allegedly took billions of
rupiah from the hospitals' earnings every month. (swe)

Though video and cable TV have practically brought the elephant

<TEXT>
into the living room, meeting the pachyderm in the flesh is an
exciting experience for a child as much as for a jaded adult.
Usually the thrill of this spectacle can only be enjoyed at the
local zoo or a passing circus. A sighting in the tusker's natural
habitat in the wild is not an everyday happening. Video films have
the advantage of showing the herd in its daily activities by the
waterside and in the water, on the plains and by the groves of
trees, especially banana groves. The intelligence and sociable
nature of the largest land animal, is a palpably felt by human
viewers.
	   Consequently, it is not surprising that one may be deeply
perturbed at the sight of these affectionate, lumbering beasts
being mercilessly shot down. Habitual hunters are considerably
desensitised. To them sending these mammoths down to the dust to
lie unmoving is savage pursuit that bolsters the ego. There is no
stigma to hunting if there is a reasonable purpose. But
recrimination is inevitable when poachers, international and local,
invade the deep forests in the Cox's Bazaar region and kill
elephants to take away their tusks, leaving the carcass to rot on
the jungle floor. It should be noted that poaching activities of
rare animals is rendered easy when some unscrupulous forest
officials connive with the illegal tusk and ivory collectors.
	   For the last few years, elephant poaching has reportedly being
going on unabated. Forest officials have been active in trying to
contain the poaching. One official has been suspended. But it is
felt a more radical approach is needed to solve the problem.The
practical approach to prevent poaching would be to let tourists,
native and foreign, be regular visitors. Observation towers could
be constructed near the spots frequented by the elephants. The
forest officials could seek the cooperation of the Parjatan
Corporation to make this project viable.

NATO experts arrive in Macedonia to evaluate conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ With violence raging in neighboring
Kosovo province, a 40-member team of NATO experts arrived Thursday
in Macedonia to evaluate conditions for a possible alliance
presence.
	   ``This is only a visit to evaluate technical conditions while a
NATO presence would depend on the U.N. Security Council's decision
...,'' Macedonian Defense Minister Lazar Kitanoski told reporters.
	   The NATO team will stay in Macedonia several days, examining
communications facilities for a NATO presence and view a military
facility where a NATO Partnership for Peace exercise is to take
place in September.
	   NATO ministers agreed last week on increased cooperation to help
Albania and Macedonia patrol their borders and on joint exercises
with forces from the two Balkan nations.
	   On Wednesday, U.N. chief Kofi Annan recommended that the 750
U.N. peacekeepers stay in Macedonia until at least February and
raised the possibility of more soldiers heading to the region.
	   The current U.N. mission was scheduled to leave Macedonia by
September. The peacekeepers were sent there in 1992 to the prevent
the Bosnian war from spilling over into Macedonia.
	   NATO commander for Northwestern Europe, Marshal Sir John
Cheshire, told reporters in Skopje that the Partnership for Peace
military exercise in Macedonia would be one of the largest in the
region.
	   Twenty-four countries, 11 of them NATO members, with a total of
700 soldiers are due to participate in the exercise at the Krivolak
military facility, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Macedonia's
capital Skopje,
	   ``I will be talking with my military colleagues here and I need
to see the training area,'' Cheshire said.

WIRELESS communications in the next century will be equally

<TEXT>
driven by technology as well as people, said Arraycom Inc's
co-founder and chairman Martin Cooper.
	   Cooper, known in the industry as a visionary and the inventor of
the world's first cellular telephone, said while technology defines
the boundaries of what people can do, it is the people who
determine which applications are adopted, which products are
purchased, and also what technologies become practical.
	   ``Now, there is a new wave of technological awareness and
competence that is sweeping across what used to be called the
less-developed countries,''Cooper said.
	   ``This new wave is a crucial change in the telecommunications
industry throughout the world,'' he said in his keynote lecture at
the opening of the 1998 International Wireless and
Telecommunications Symposium in Shah Alam recently.
	   In his speech, Cooper said there are two significant changes in
the wireless telecommunications sector that are more impressive and
have greater impact than any piece of hardware created or new
service offered.
	   He said the first change is that the industry, though slowing
down in growth, is genuinely expanding in countries which used to
be buyers of technologies and services.
	   In the past, countries with emerging economies will only adopt
new products and technologies created by a few companies from the
more developed countries, and rely on such companies to make
fundamental decisions on deploying these products and technologies.
	   ``Now, countries are no longer satisfied to just follow, but are
determined to lead by being involved in the creation and
manufacturing of the latest technologies,'' Cooper said.
	   Instead of exporting their most valuable technological resource,
which is the people, countries are starting to export results of
research and development work, he added.
	   According to Cooper, the second critical change in the sector is
the existence of choices. Consumers will find that in the future
there will be a broad variety of products, services and prices, all
targeted at different age groups, economic classes, and
professions.
	   ``Manufacturers are starting to offer a selection of air
interfaces, and product solutions are coming out of multinational
development laboratories and production lines,'' he said.
	   Cooper said the carriers are also becoming less dependent on
manufacturers to make decisions on technology.
	   Though not yet here, open architecture in wireless communication
systems is also another future phenomenon, he added.

TYCOON Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa still expects to reap a

<TEXT>
reasonable rental yield from its Cheung Kong Centre in Central, an
office development currently under construction.
	   The group expects to reap a reasonable yield despite the
sluggish condition of the office market.
	   There was speculation yesterday that poor prospects for the
office market prompted Hutchison to offer prospective tenant
Goldman Sachs a very generous rent offer: Two years free rent for
the premises the US investment house will likely take up at the
centre. The rent would have worked out to a very low of $38 per
square foot with the two-year rent- free agreement. But a Hutchison
spokeswoman denied the reports.
	   She said although Goldman Sachs is one of its prospective
tenants in the building, no leasing agreement has yet been reached.
	   She said many companies, including multinationals and financial
institutions, are negotiating with Hutchison to take up office
space in the centre at rents ranging from $50 to $60 per sq ft.
	   An analyst with an Asian brokerage said rental yield for Cheung
Kong Centre is expected to reach 6 to 6.5 per cent.
	   He said that average office rental for the Central district is
around $55 per sq ft, which puts Hutchison's asking price in line
with market expectations.
	   However, this figure is slightly below Hutchison's earlier
expectation.
	   Hutchison Whampoa Properties managing director Raymond Chow said
in February that the group will launch the first batch of 400,000
sq ft of office space for rent at no less than $60 per sq ft.
	   He said at the time that rent would not be lower than that of
South West Tower, an office development above the Airport Railway's
Central Station.
	   According to property consulting firm Vigers Hong Kong, the
largest office rental decreases will be seen in Hong Kong Island
East district over the coming few months where large supplies of
new office space coming onto the market will force developers to
offer extremely attractive rates to attract tenants.

THE provisional liquidator for the Ming Fung Group yesterday

<TEXT>
said negotiations were now in progress with prospective buyers of
the group's businesses.
	   KPMG Peat Marwick said there were also talks on the sale of
individual licences and membership separate from the group
operations.
	   The group collapsed due to the misuse of investors funds.
	   Its demise has added to the gloom that has descended over Hong
Kong's broking industry following the spectacular collapse of CA
Pacific Securities and Peregrine Investments.
	   It has sparked fears that more brokerages could go under, given
the difficult environment facing stocks. Market volume has thinned
considerably as volatility has impacted on sentiment.
	   The liquidator also said yesterday that the wind-up hearing for
four Ming Fung Group companies has been fixed for 8 July.
	   The four are Chark Fung Securities, Wibston Commerce, Ming Fung
Bullion and Kee Fung Siung International Finance.
	   The liquidator said an informal meeting of the customers of the
said companies will be convened.
	   ``The purpose of the meeting is to report on an informal basis
to customers progress of the provisional liquidation to date.

Herodotus, the first great Greek historian who lived in the

<TEXT>
fifth and fourth century B.C., writes: Each man has but one wife,
yet the wives are held in common...Human life does not come to its
natural close with these people; but when a man grows very old, all
his kinsfolk collect together and offer him up in sacrifice;
offering at the same time some cattle also. After the sacrifice
they boil the flesh and feast on it; and those who thus end their
days are reckoned the happiest. If a man dies of disease they do
not eat him, bury him in the ground, bewailing his ill-fortune that
he did not come to be sacrificed.
	   In the above paragraph, Herodotus describes the customs that
Massagetae, a tribal people, used to observe. Herodotus did not
think that the Massagetae should be criticized for such practices,
because he believed that Right and Wrong are little more than names
for social conventions. This is perhaps the oldest philosophical
theory of morality: Right and Wrong are relative to one's society.
The history of human civilization proves that this view contains a
substantial element of truth. As philosopher Rousseau says in his
classic The Social Contract: The strongest man is never strong to
be master all the time, unless he transforms force into Right and
obedience into Duty.
	   The origin of a society is both natural and necessitating:
Natural, because humans are gregarious beings; necessitating,
because, they cannot support their survival, let alone achieving
their goals, without living in a society.The foundation of a
society is its customs and laws- rules and principles that guide
and control human behaviour and social relationships. And the very
basis of societal customs and laws is human conceptions of
morality- ideas and views that determine rightness and wrongness of
human behaviour and social relationships.Our nation is grappling
with gargantuan problems. The fundamental reason must be our
conceptions about our customs and laws, particularly those
regulating our political system- the government and political
parties.
	   The government represents the sovereign authority of the state,
the people. It is empowered to command and control all individual
behaviours and societal relationships: It commands by legislating
laws and controls by executing those laws. But its power and
authority are also restricted: The government is forbidden- legally
and morally- from interfering in the exercise of rightful
authorities developed to manage myriads of institutions
constituting the society. Our customs seem to ignore this legal and
moral limit of government's authority: The government leaders
appear to think that they have the authority to lay their hands on
any matter they want.
	   And people seem to accept this as customary. This very custom is
creating more problems in our nation than we think and
understand.The current crisis in BUET, which is rocking the whole
nation, is a good example. The story goes like this: BUET's
Academic Council introduced a new system of Admission Tests. The
faculties of Architecture Department considered the new system as
jeopardizing departmental interests. They reasoned and protested to
stop the system, but failed to convince their colleagues.
	   Finally, to challenge BUET's authority, 15 out of 22 teachers
submitted a joint resignation letter which BUET Syndicate accepted.
The thirteen teachers (two had withdrawn their resignations) then
influenced the government to change the decision of the Syndicate.
Unable to swallow government's interference in his rightful
authority, the BUET VC resigned, indicating personal ground. This
was followed by a series of resignations. Along with this, the BUET
teachers' association went on an indefinite strike demanding
reinstatement of the VC and promise of non-interference from the
government (The Independent 5 May). BUET is now under lock and key.
When will it resume its assigned duties and activities? Nobody
knows, because the BUET authorities and protesting teachers are
warming up their muscles to fight a legal battle, reports say.
	   This will linger the impasse.How do we judge the BUET crisis? It
should be clear that the crisis has developed from the improper
exercise of authority and the improper means and methods of
protests. All public universities are defined as autonomous public
institutions, because they are managed and administered by
University Ordinances: The university administrations headed by VCs
have complete freedom over their management principles and
policies. The government- Ministry of Education- controls Public
Universities (PUs) because they are publicly funded institutions.
It controls PUs by appointing VCs, (there are two systems),
nominating a number of Syndicate members, providing fund for
meeting operational and developmental expenditures and finally
monitoring their performance.
	   There are indeed two levels of authorities for PUs:
administration and the Ministry of Education. But their functions
are very clearly defined: PU administrations- officials and
faculties appointed/ nominated to different administrative posts
and bodies- are empowered to carry out all administrative and
academic responsibilities. The Ministry is responsible to monitor
the performance of PU administrations, a responsibility it is
performing with utmost inefficiency and irresponsibility. It has
the authority to demand explanations from the university on any
matters of public concerns or of laws violations and has the
authority to take punitive and preventive measures, but has no
authority to dictate their policies.
	   The very concept of higher authority should, therefore, be
understood in a general sense: The government is a higher authority
for everyone in the nation, because it represents the people, the
sovereign authority.No accusations have been made which suggest
that BUET authority had adopted irregularities in introducing the
new admission system: University rules have not been violated. This
means that appropriate means and opportunities were given to
ventilate all criticisms and objections to the new system.The
situation developed into a crisis when 15 teachers took their
complaints to the relevant higher authorities: The Education
Minister, the Political Adviser to PM and the highest authority of
the nation, the Prime Minster. The aggrieved teachers protested the
decision of BUET authority by improper means and methods and the
government in its turn exercised its authority improperly.
	   The question we need to seriously investigate is: Why have these
events taken place? Definitely the government has involved itself
in the matter that is clearly beyond its jurisdiction. And it has
done so by taking a partisan view: The 13 teachers could never do
what they had done if they had not gotten adequate assurance and
encouragement from our higher authorities.But, why should the
government take this political risk?Two factors appear to be quite
apparent. First, like all other PUs, BUET's Chancellor was the
President. During the last BNP rule, BUET changed its Ordinance and
made Prime Minister its Chancellor. This was an explicit act of
partisan manoeuvre. This could have never taken place if the BUET
teaching community were not overwhelmingly dominated by BNP
supporters.
	   BUET teaching community does not have the honest non-partisan
face it claims to have: the accusation of interference may well be
interpreted as a convenient expression. Considering this fact, the
present government might wish to strengthen its partisan support in
BUET. What is wrong with that?Most people would be of the opinion
that BUET would not have this problem if President Shahabuddin
Ahmed were the Chancellor.Second, BUETTA has failed to marshal much
support in favour of its movement. Although some political parties
have criticised the government and supported BUETTA, this has
weakened its case because they belong to one political camp.
	   Neither the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers
Association (FBUTA) nor any individual Teachers Association (except
Jahangir Nagar University) have made a statement supporting
BUETTA's movement. One reason may be that FBUTA does not support
BUETTA's interference allegation. Whatever the reason, the silence
of FBUTA creates doubts in public mind about the accusation of
interference: If other PU teachers do not treat the government
involvement as interference, why BUET teachers should?FBUTA is
giving both political and moral support to the government to think
that it has done nothing wrong. How do we know that the government
is in fact not being advised of no impropriety in its actions?
	   Why should the government then admit that it has acted
improperly?Herodotus concluded that ``custom is the king over
all''. The PU teaching community has created this culture of
interference by our higher authorities and they faithfully observe
this custom of interference, because they vested interests in it.
If they want to stop this interference by our higher authorities,
they must change the custom.''The air is full of cries. But habit
is a great deadener'', Samuel Beckett (1906-1989).

JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed plantation company PT Astra Agro

<TEXT>
Lestari plans to export 75,000 metric tons of crude palm oil (CPO)
this year, or about 25 percent of its total production of 300,000
tons, the company said yesterday.
	   The company's marketing director, Hasan Tebiono, said export
operations would start this month, with a 5,000-ton shipment to be
delivered to Singapore this week.
	   ``We plan to export about 25 percent of our CPO this year. We
also plan to expand our plantation acreage by 15,000 hectares,'' he
said at a news conference after a company shareholders meeting.
	   He said the company expected to produce 300,000 tons of CPO this
year, up from 254,362 tons in 1997, due to the rapid expansion of
its plantation area.
	   The company produced 196,622 tons of CPO in 1996.
	   Hasan said Astra Agro originally projected a production of
370,000 tons of CPO this year. That target was revised to 300,000
tons due to the drought caused by the El Nino weather pattern.
	   The high prices of CPO in the global market will be advantageous
to the firm, Hasan said.
	   CPO sold at $670 per ton on the international market last month,
compared to $290 per ton domestically. International CPO prices are
expected to decline to $650 per ton in June.
	   ``Although the government imposes a 40 percent export tax on CPO
exports, I think we are lucky enough that it lifted the export ban
on CPO products,'' he said.
	   Under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the
government lifted its CPO export ban on April 22 and replaced it
with an export tax of 40 percent.
	   Although the international CPO price is predicted to decline in
the coming months due to greater supply, the company will not be
badly affected, Hasan said.
	   The company, a plantation subsidiary of publicly listed PT Astra
International, also announced that it posted a net profit of Rp 29
billion (US$2.9 million) in the first quarter of this year.
	   Company president Benny Subianto said he could not give
comparative figures, saying that the company only went public in
December.
	   He said the shareholders agreed to a company proposal to pay a
final dividend of Rp 37 per share.
	   Astra Agro booked a 43.1 percent increase in net profit last
year to Rp 90.6 billion from Rp 63.3 billion in 1996.
	   Benny also said the company recorded Rp 459 billion in net sales
last year, an increase from Rp 342.1 billion.
	   Astra Agro expects to record a total of Rp 1 trillion in net
sales this year due to projected growth of export sales.
	   ``With increasing CPO allocations for export, we are optimistic
of reaching the sales target this year,'' he said.
	   Benny said the company was optimistic of performing well this
year since it was not burdened by significant foreign exchange
debts.
	   He said the monetary crisis, which has seen the rupiah's value
fall 70 percent against the American dollar, had not adversely
affected the performance of the company since it generated some of
its revenue in dollars.
	   Astra Agro, listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, operates 39
plantations covering 192,758 hectares, of which 177,976 hectares or
92 percent are for palm oil, while the remaining 14,782 hectares is
for rubber, cocoa and tea. (gis)

TAN Sri Tajudin Ramli came closer towards settling the RM1.79

<TEXT>
billion purchase of his stake in Malaysia Airlines with the final
settlement expected to be made according to schedule.
	   The first portion of RM100 million will be made by Malaysian
Helicopter Services Bhd on June 12.
	   The debt for the Malaysia Airlines stake purchase was assumed by
MHS - which is 52.24 per cent-owned by Tajudin - and it has already
obtained the cash needed to make this first payment.
	   Another RM250 million is due on June 12 next year and the final
RM600 million is payable on June 12, 2000.
	   This payment will go to the cumulative sinking fund established
for redemption of RM600 million bonds issued in May 1995 - the
proceeds of which was used as part-payment for the Malaysia
Airlines stake acquired by Tajudin.
	   MHS, now renamed Naluri Bhd, raised the required cash for the
payment with proceeds from the sale of its helicopter division and
stakes in World Airways Inc and Schreiner Aviation Group BV, among
others.
	   Tajudin, who has now been appointed Naluri chairman, yesterday
said the assets were sold off as they were seen as mature
investments and Naluri had to move on to other businesses with
growth potential.
	   Speaking after Naluri's annual and extraordinary meetings in
Kuala Lumpur, Tajudin declined to name the new businesses which
will be pumped into the company, saying that it will be in-line
with his ``Three-T's''
	   vision.
	   The ``Three-T's'' refer to the transport, telecommunications and
tourism sectors which Tajudin has interests in - via Malaysia
Airlines, Technology Resources Industries Bhd and his personal
businesses.
	   ``There is a convergence of many diverse sectors and electronic
services is one area which Naluri can possibly go into,'' said
Tajudin.
	   Asked about Naluri's interests in Air Maldives and Royal Air
Cambodge, he said the investments made so far had been small.
	   However, as Air Maldives is expected to report its first quarter
of profits soon, this represents a new income stream for Naluri, he
said. As for Air Cambodge, Tajudin said the political situation in
Cambodia still left uncertainty over the investment.
	   ``We are downsizing the activities of Naluri as a whole in
preparation to building up new business and also pay off all
debts,'' said Tajudin, adding that immediate debts due amount to
about RM220 million.
	   As for Naluri's former executive chairman Tan Sri Saw Lye Huat,
Tajudin said he will remain a director at the company as his
experience and services were still needed.

TWO days after it was introduced, the Hong Kong dollar

<TEXT>
repurchase market for locally denominated debts has only managed to
attract a few trades.
	   It is understood that yesterday's transaction volume for the
repo market reached just over $100 million, handled by Dao Heng
Bank, with all the collaterals being exchange notes and bonds.
	   Both the Bank of China and Standard Chartered Bank said they did
not process any transactions yesterday.
	   Chris Langley, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks (HKAB) and executive director of HongkongBank, said it was
still too early to reach a conclusion as to whether the market was
achieving its goal of enhancing liquidity for banks.
	   He said the repo market was a standby facility given to banks,
which could gain knowledge and ability to improve their short-term
liquidity.
	   ``It's up to the market players whether or not to use the
facility; they know it's there in case, and very often they don't
draw down on it, so I think let the market decide to what extent
they wish to use it; it's not something we need to force,'' he
added.
	   ``Let's give a few more weeks and see how the repo market go.''
Analysts believe the repo market would only be able to kick off
smoothly in one to two weeks and it will give flexibility to banks'
short-term liquidity.
	   Mr Langley said the market was not really in Hong Kong and that
it has become a very common facility widely utilised in all sort of
financial institutions.
	   The repo market, he said, could strengthen Hong Kong's
competitiveness in banking.
	   Meanwhile, Mr Langley said HongkongBank had no intention of
discounting any retail mortgage portfolio with the Hong Kong
Mortgages Corp (HKMC) at the moment, despite the introdution of the
purchase program for residential mortgages.

Within three weeks, the subcontinent has stormed into a new age

<TEXT>
of uncertainty, full of looming fears of a nuclear holocaust, the
horrors of which beggar all description.While the inhabitants of
this region have a lot to answer for in this regard, the
international community, which is looking at this new mess
wide-eyed, wringing its hands at the fate the region has fallen to,
is not blameless either. Pakistan's six nuclear tests have come in
the wake of the failure of the world powers to take firm and stern
action against India after its nuclear testing and its subsequent
open threats to attack Islamabad. For all its gushing rhetoric of
concern to strengthen and protect anti-proliferation regime in the
world, the international community had been remarkably impotent in
dealing with a nuclear Delhi. The best it did was to slap
half-hearted sanctions on India, and that too after grave
disagreement and endless debate about their usefulness.
	   And for Pakistan, threatened by a nuclear armed India, it had
nothing other than good advice and a voice of concern to offer. The
Pakistani officials were constantly in touch with governments of
other countries and these talks centred on shaping up and
finalising the various workable alternatives to the option of
testing a nuclear device. Pakistan was open to suggestions and had
not presented any wishlist to any country in exchange for foregoing
the nuclear test option. It did, however, listen keenly and debated
openly whatever offers were made. These offers fell in three
categories, which also summed up how far the international
community was willing to go to support a country showing restraint
in the face of deliberate provocation by a mighty nuclear rogue
with a short temper and a bullying arm.
	   The first category was strong diplomatic backing to Pakistan's
stand and extensive and collective support to and approval of
Islamabad's restraint in the face of Indian provocation.One refrain
of the telephonic conversations which the British Prime Minister
and the American President had had with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
was how Islamabad had gone up in the eyes of the civilised world
for keeping a cool head. Part of the same category of offers was a
vague promise of a sterner stand by UN Security Council on
belligerent Indian statements on Kashmir and suggestions that the
world would take notice of Delhi's words and actions in this
regard. Severer condemnation of the Indian nuclear action was an
extension of the same set of offers made to Pakistan. An example of
this came by the 25 May statement from the European Union which
slightly stiffened its stand against India, despite serious
internal disagreements.
	   The declaration said that the Indian tests were a grave threat
to the global efforts towards non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament; that the European Union will follow closely the
evolution of the situation and will take all necessary measures
should India not accede to a move to ratify the relevant
international non-proliferation agreements. The declaration also
said that the member states of the European Union would work for a
delay in consideration of loans to India in the World Bank and
other international institutions. The same declaration also
attempted to show that it shared Pakistan's concern: India's
nuclear tests have caused understandable concern in Pakistan for
her security, national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
	   It also said that the European Union shared Pakistan's concern
for the peace and stability of the region. But also that Pakistan
should not test the nuclear device. The second category of offers
was primarily economic, which covered a broad range of incentives,
such as writing off a portion of Pakistan's external debt, and
rescheduling of the rest on easy conditions and over a longer
period of time. There was never a suggestion or a proposal from any
quarter which would specifically talk about the defence of Pakistan
against an Indian attack, or isolating India completely as a
punishment for its nuclear misdeed. No state, not even those most
committed to the cause of nuclear disarmament like Japan, wanted to
go so far in expressing their disapproval of Indian action or
assuring Pakistan of a safe future. The world community failed to
rise to the occasion which tested their true commitment to
non-proliferation and how desperately they wanted to stem the tide
of madness India unleashed on 11 May.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union said Thursday that clashes on
the disputed border between Ethiopia and Eritrea are ``unacceptable
and could endanger regional stability and development'' in the Horn
of Africa.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that on
Wednesday, after the clashes, he spoke to both Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Eritrea's President Isaias
Afewerki.
	   ``I urged both sides to find a solution by peaceful means, and I
stressed that the European Union fully supports mediation
efforts,'' said Cook.
	   Britain currently holds the presidency of the EU.

'WELL, this is as usual in our country. What is needed here,
that is not urged properly. Even if it is urged, it is urged
neither with zeal nor with commitment.' A senior citizen, utterly
pessimistic on the nutrition scenario of the country, said when
asked how he was looking at the determinants of malnutrition in
Bangladesh. He, at the end of his mundane journey, sounded
awesomely, It's disastrous, it's ominous. Before going into the
discussion session of malnutrition, should I draw your attention to
two of the prime sectors of the country- family planning and
education?He then went on with his emphatic vocabulary. In these
two sectors, when the world-wide advancement is overleaping, we are
trying to proceed in snail's pace, Have you ever asked yourself
Why'? It is so for the reasons of lacunae in procedures. First, we
are designing motivational programmes for those who are already
motivated.
Second, we cannot reach the people beset with problems and

<TEXT>
needs, living mainly in the vast rural areas or in thick urban
slums. They are in dearth of everything- money, education,
consciousness and what not. They cannot reach or read our
programmes. Our words go beyond their level of grasping capacity.
They are the first to send their wards to paddy fields as
agricultural aides, in urban mansions as domestic aides and so on.
It is our failure that we could not make our people aware of some
frightening facts. Our babies are born with low birth weight'
almost in 2 out of 4 cases.
	   We, even the educated' ones, do not believe that carrying women
are prone to a lot many health hazards and they need a constant
flow of nutrition supply as the embryo they carry is supposed to
achieve two million times growth of a fertilized ovum. It may sound
new to a good number of us who claim to be alive to the state of
public health-situation of the country that 5000 women die due to
causes associated with anaemia and 700 children die every day just
because of malnutrition. Women in our country, are still confined
largely to a peculiar cycle of cooking after feeding and feeding
after cooking'. Do we know that 70% of the mal-nourished Children
are in SEA- countries (SEA: South East Asia) and 70% of them are in
India and Bangladesh?

Alcatel chief says DSC buy complements U.S. telecom activity
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: COMBINES Dallas-dated story; UPDATES with shares falling
further  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alcatel Alsthom announced Thursday it has agreed to
buy Dallas-based DSC Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4.4 billion
share swap aimed at giving vitality to its U.S. operations.
	   The two companies, which made the announcement simultaneously in
Paris and Texas, praised the move as beneficial to both sides.
Nevertheless, Alcatel shares fell sharply upon news of the
acquisition.
	   Paris-based traders said that 20 minutes after trading opened in
New York, shares fell by 7.8 percent, dragged down by arbitrage
between Alcatel's French shares and its New York Stock Exchange
Depository shares.
	   Traders here said that showed investor concern the acquisition
will be more dilutive than anticipated.
	   Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman and chief executive officer,
told journalists that Alcatel would have to issue 20 million new
shares, or approximately 12 percent of its capital due to the
transaction.
	   The acquisition will complement its U.S. telecommunications
network business and give Alcatel a jump-start in the networking
activities it has been interested in pursuing, Tchuruk said.
	   DCS specializes in certain aspects of fixed access systems such
as fixed line switches and transit switches, and also produces
local mobile switches as well as so-called intelligent networks.
	   Alcatel's U.S. operation focuses on transmission and has a
developing local access ADSL business.
	   ``We believe that DCS brings us what we are lacking,'' Tchuruk
said.
	   He said that while the group is not looking to acquire companies
in order to access technology, ``what we are lacking today is a
significant base to put into use these technologies.''
	   ``This transaction provides increased value to DSC
shareholders,'' said James L. Donald, DSC's chairman and chief
executive. ``In addition, DSC shareholders will have an ongoing
equity interest in a much larger company with improved long-term
growth potential and investment liquidity.''
	   Combined, DCS and Alcatel will have estimated 1998 sales of dlrs
4.5 billion. Tchuruk expects annual cost savings of dlrs 200
million, with 60 percent of that to be realized in 1999 and 90
percent to be realized in the year 2000.

State Department suspends federal army training for non-compliance
</HEADLINE>
  By SRECKO LATAL  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The U.S. State Department
has suspended parts of the American-sponsored training program for
the army of the Muslim-Croat federation, officials said Thursday.
	   American diplomats in Sarajevo refused to elaborate on the
record, but in private contacts said the move was triggered by
Bosnian Croat and Muslim sluggishness in adopting required common
military badges and eliminating previous national insignia.
	   Western diplomats accused above all Bosnian Croats for the
impasse, adding another reason for the suspension was the recent
hardening of the Bosnian Croat leaders' stance on other aspects of
peace implementation.
	   This includes their refusal to accept common state symbols such
as a flag, coat-of-arms, new neutral car-license plates and the
unification of the joint Muslim-Croat police.
	   The diplomats who asked for anonymity said the move was aimed at
pressuring Bosnian Croats to finally break the impasse and respect
the peace accord.
	   The diplomats are also unhappy with the sluggish return of
non-Muslims to Muslim-dominated Sarajevo.
	   ``We've received a notice ... that the State Department is
suspending certain training operations within the `Train and Equip
program' and these will be suspended for a limited period of
time,'' said Joseph Allred, a spokesman for the American contractor
company Military Professional Resources Inc., or MPRI, which is
conducting and overseeing the training.
	   He said the parts of the suspended program include training of
new soldiers and assisting in the allocation of military equipment
from storage facilities to units.
	   Allred said MPRI will continue working with those students who
are currently in the leadership training program. The company will
also continue assisting in transportation of new equipment from
abroad and maintenance of the current equipment in storage sites.
	   ``But as far as actual training is concerned, we are on the
pause right now,'' Allred told The Associated Press. He refused to
elaborate on the reasons.
	   The dlrs 400 million ``Train and Equip'' program was made a part
of the 1995 Dayton peace accord that stopped the 3 1/2-year war.

Sunni fundamentalists in, Christians out in Tripoli vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Sunni Muslim fundamentalists made
surprise gains in municipal elections in Lebanon's second-largest
city, results showed Thursday.
	   The rise of the Muslim fundamentalists and the decline in the
representation of the minority Christians in the northern port city
of Tripoli sparked fears that the same will be repeated in Beirut.
	   The Lebanese capital, Beirut _ with a majority Sunni Muslim
municipality _ and southern Lebanon will vote Sunday in the third
of a four-stage local elections, the first in Lebanon in 35 years.
	   Official results from last Sunday's elections in the North that
were published in newspapers Thursday showed fundamentalists won
eight seats on Tripoli's 24-member city council.
	   A ticket backed by former prime minister Omar Karami, a Tripoli
native, won 11 seats and five slots went to candidates backed by
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
	   The two moderate Sunni politicians have feuded for years, with
Karami accusing Hariri of seeking to dominate Tripoli.
	   Karami on Thursday claimed that the results were rigged, thus
denying him a majority on the city council and the power to chose a
mayor.
	   Only one Christian councilman was elected in the largely Sunni
city of 400,000 despite calls by Muslim leaders on the electorate
to respect a gentleman's agreement to give Christians more
representation.
	   Christians held four slots on the previous 18-seat council for
Tripoli. They kept their 4-seat share on the expanded 24-member
council.
	   The elections were billed as opening a new chapter after the
1975-90 civil war between Lebanon's Christian and Muslim
communities. But representation of the major 18 sects on virtually
all government jobs remains a sensitive issue.
	   Christian politicians have voiced concern that Muslim voters in
Beirut would turn en masse to elect Muslim candidates from rival
tickets and thus deny the capital's 24-member council equal
representation.
	   Prime Minister Hariri's supporters joined hands with mainstream
politicians and religious leaders, including the Shiite Muslim
militant Hezbollah, to forge together a ticket that would respect
the balance in the capital.

When individuals break the law, they feel the full weight of the

<TEXT>
legal system. But when states flagrantly violate internationally
accepted standards, what is the solution? New, stricter standards,
the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has apparently
concluded, with respect to eradicating one of the world's most
glaring human rights violations: child labour. Although the ILO
Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) and Forced Labour Convention (No.
29) have been ratified by a large number of countries, more than
250 million five to 14-yearolds continue to work throughout the
world. Given that situation, the ILO will present new international
labour standards on extreme forms of child labour at the June 2-18
International Labour Conference in Geneva.
	   The debate on the new standards coincides with a campaign that
included the Global March against Child Labour, which set out from
Manila Jan. 17 and reached Geneva on the occasion of the
International Labour Conference. The core message of the Global
March - which toured 97 African, Asian, Latin American, North
American and European countries - calls for respecting a child's
right to be free from economic exploitation and the right to free
compulsory education. The new standards focus on extreme forms of
child labour: work that is likely to jeopardise the safety, health
and morals of children; slavery and practices similar to slavery;
child prostitution and pornography. Prior to drawing up the draft
to be presented at next month's Conference, the ILO sent a
questionnaire to governments, unions and employers, whose responses
were compiled in a report released recently.
	   Taking into account those responses, the ILO decided to suggest
that the new standards take the form of conventions, which create
legal obligations on states which ratify them, supplemented by
recommendations to provide further guidance and suggestions for
implementation. The ILO wants the new standards to ensure that
immediate action is taken to suppress extreme forms of child
labour, grouped in three main categories: a) all forms of slavery
and practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and trafficking
of children, forced or compulsory labour, debt bondage and serfdom;
b) the use, engagement or offering of a child in illegal
activities, for prostitution, production of pornography or
pornographic performances; c) any other type of work or activity
which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried
out, is likely to jeopardise the health, safety or morals of
children, so that they should not be used or engaged in such work
or activity under any circumstances.
	   The director of the ILO's Working Conditions and Environment
Department, Assefa Bequele, said that 'there is overwhelming
support among ILO constituents for putting an end to the
intolerable exploitation and abuse of children in hazardous work
and conditions of slavery and practices similar to slavery.'' The
ILO would like this year's Conference to debate the initiative and
arrange for the preparation of a final draft to be approved at the
1999 Conference. The United Nations body also recommends the
creation of monitoring mechanisms to ensure effective application
-generally the touchiest items in negotiations on international
agreements. The ILO's latest report indicates that of the 250
million children working worldwide, 61 percent live in Asia, 32
percent in Africa and seven percent in Latin America. But while
most child labour is found in developing countries, industrialised
economies are not entirely free of the scourge.
	   In eastern and central Europe, for example, child labour has
been reappearing in the wake of social and economic dislocation
caused by the transition to a market economy. ILO data indicates a
boy:girl ratio of three:two in child labour. The highest rate of
girls involved in economic activity is found in Africa, where 37
percent of girls work. There are believed to be five major
international networks trafficking in children: from Latin America
to Europe and the Middle East; from south and southeast Asia to
northern Europe and the Middle East; a European regional market; an
associated Middle Eastern regional market; and a West Africa export
market in girls.

JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed plantation company PT Astra Agro

<TEXT>
Lestari plans to export 75,000 metric tons of crude palm oil (CPO)
this year, or about 25 percent of its total production of 300,000
tons, the company said yesterday.
	   The company's marketing director, Hasan Tebiono, said export
operations would start this month, with a 5,000-ton shipment to be
delivered to Singapore this week.
	   ``We plan to export about 25 percent of our CPO this year. We
also plan to expand our plantation acreage by 15,000 hectares,'' he
said at a news conference after a company shareholders meeting.
	   He said the company expected to produce 300,000 tons of CPO this
year, up from 254,362 tons in 1997, due to the rapid expansion of
its plantation area.
	   The company produced 196,622 tons of CPO in 1996.
	   Hasan said Astra Agro originally projected a production of
370,000 tons of CPO this year. That target was revised to 300,000
tons due to the drought caused by the El Nino weather pattern.
	   The high prices of CPO in the global market will be advantageous
to the firm, Hasan said.
	   CPO sold at $670 per ton on the international market last month,
compared to $290 per ton domestically. International CPO prices are
expected to decline to $650 per ton in June.
	   ``Although the government imposes a 40 percent export tax on CPO
exports, I think we are lucky enough that it lifted the export ban
on CPO products,'' he said.
	   Under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the
government lifted its CPO export ban on April 22 and replaced it
with an export tax of 40 percent.
	   Although the international CPO price is predicted to decline in
the coming months due to greater supply, the company will not be
badly affected, Hasan said.
	   The company, a plantation subsidiary of publicly listed PT Astra
International, also announced that it posted a net profit of Rp 29
billion (US$2.9 million) in the first quarter of this year.
	   Company president Benny Subianto said he could not give
comparative figures, saying that the company only went public in
December.
	   He said the shareholders agreed to a company proposal to pay a
final dividend of Rp 37 per share.
	   Astra Agro booked a 43.1 percent increase in net profit last
year to Rp 90.6 billion from Rp 63.3 billion in 1996.
	   Benny also said the company recorded Rp 459 billion in net sales
last year, an increase from Rp 342.1 billion.
	   Astra Agro expects to record a total of Rp 1 trillion in net
sales this year due to projected growth of export sales.
	   ``With increasing CPO allocations for export, we are optimistic
of reaching the sales target this year,'' he said.
	   Benny said the company was optimistic of performing well this
year since it was not burdened by significant foreign exchange
debts.
	   He said the monetary crisis, which has seen the rupiah's value
fall 70 percent against the American dollar, had not adversely
affected the performance of the company since it generated some of
its revenue in dollars.
	   Astra Agro, listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, operates 39
plantations covering 192,758 hectares, of which 177,976 hectares or
92 percent are for palm oil, while the remaining 14,782 hectares is
for rubber, cocoa and tea. (gis)

JAKARTA (JP): Activist Yeni Rosa Damayanti, returning after a

<TEXT>
three-year self-exile in the Netherlands, pledged to continue her
struggle for democracy and told her colleagues that Soeharto was
just one of many obstacles which had to be overcome.
	   ``We must make sure that Indonesia never again falls under the
reign of another authoritarian government... That's our job now,''
the 29-year-old said before a boisterous crowd of 100 activists
gathered to welcome her here last night.
	   ``We still have a lot of work to do. Soeharto was just the first
obstacle,'' she said before an approving crowd comprised mostly of
Center of Information and Action Network for Reform (Pijar)
members.
	   Her audacity helped shoot her name from obscurity in 1994 when
she was sentenced to jail for slandering then president Soeharto
during a demonstration here.
	   After serving a six-month prison sentence she went to Europe.
	   In 1995 she was linked, along with politician Sri Bintang
Pamungkas, to the organization of an anti-Soeharto rally in the
German city of Dresden.
	   Bintang returned home and was sentenced to 34 months in prison
for slandering Soeharto during a lecture in Germany.
	   Yeni decided not to return and has rarely been heard of since.
	   She arrived home for the first time yesterday morning and was
met with warm hugs and the glow of television spotlights at the
airport.
	   Later in the evening, her fellow activists held a welcoming
party at the Perintis Kemerdekaan building in Central Jakarta.
	   Present in the crowd were human rights campaigner HJC Princen
and scholar Daniel Dhakidae.
	   Yeni expressed her dismay at returning to see ``the situation
worse than during Soeharto's rule''.
	   She said she was saddened at the dour economic hardships being
faced by the Indonesian people.
	   While exclaiming that she was quite happy to see the end of
Soeharto's power, she sorrowful at the costs the nation has had to
endure.
	   ``Hundreds of people have lost their land, thousands have been
imprisoned and died ... all in the name of development,'' she said.
	   Regarding her experience abroad, she said it was like being held
``hostage'' because she had been denied an Indonesian passport by
the embassy in the Netherlands, rendering her unable to travel out
of the country.
	   ``I tried many times to renew my passport but they kept refusing
to do it for me until a day after Soeharto resigned,'' she said.

Albania worries about Serb incursion across border; seeks aid

  Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with official warning of risk of Serb
incursion. No pickup. ADDS byline  
  With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top Albanian official warned Thursday
that Serb forces may cross into Albania from neighboring Kosovo
province to pursue their offensive against militant rebels.
	   ``The conflict may be extended to Albania. And then it will be
extremely grave. That is the reason that the Albanian government
asked NATO to deploy troops in the north of the country,'' said
Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano.
	   The Albanian government, worried about both the crush of
refugees and a new threat for its strapped military, is pushing for
Western troops to shore up its northern border. Unable to cope with
the estimated 12,000 Kosovo refugees who have arrived so far, Nano
also has asked NATO for humanitarian aid, such as food and
medicine.
	   ``The Serbian soldiers won't stop the violence and the
bloodshed. It's really not logical thinking that the situation is
going to be more calm,'' Prela told The Associated Press.
	   In his letter to NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, Nano
said: ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically.'' The letter was sent late Wednesday and released
Thursday.
	   About 12,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from secessionist Kosovo
have arrived since last weekend, Interior Ministry spokesman Artan
Bizhja said. Thousands of others are believed to be trying to join
them.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano said in his letter. ``Collaborating together (with
NATO) is the only way to save human lifes and the peace in
Kosovo.''
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the border town where most have arrived.

JAKARTA (JP): Political science experts told legislators

<TEXT>
yesterday that it was more important to ensure free and fair polls
than to debate over what kind of electoral system should be
adopted.
	   Speaking at a hearing of House of Representatives Commission II
for home affairs, political scientists Mochtar Pabottinggi and
Miriam Budiardjo said that past problems with elections were not
caused by the system itself, but by certain parties who manipulated
elections to serve their own ends.
	   ``It's not the system which should be changed, but the way in
which we approach general elections,'' Mochtar Pabottinggi of the
National Institute of Sciences (LIPI) told legislators.
	   The two experts pointed out that in the past, elections deviated
from the basic principles laid out to ensure they were free and
fair.
	   ``We should not blame the system but the New Order government
who manipulated the true purpose of elections to serve their own
interests,'' Mochtar told reporters after the meeting.
	   He said the Soeharto government had used elections to perpetuate
its power, not to uphold popular sovereignty through democracy.
	   Mochtar, who heads LIPI's Center for Political Studies, warned
that merely changing the electoral system would have little impact
on the political conditions in the country unless the nation, and
in particular the government, were thoroughly prepared.
	   Mochtar was formerly chairman of a team set up to study the
current electoral system by former president Soeharto in 1995.
	   His report concluded by saying that democracy would only be
achieved when the people themselves elected candidates to the House
of Representatives instead of having them appointed through a
proportional system.
	   Currently voters choose one of the three recognized political
organizations -- Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP), and
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
	   Seats in the House are divided between the parties according to
the number of votes they receive. Each party then selects its
legislators from a previously prepared list until it has no more
seats to fill.
	   There are 425 elected seats in the House. A further 75 are
allocated to the Armed Forces faction, who do not stand for
election.
	   The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is made up of all
members of the House and a further 500 delegates from the regional
assemblies, all of whom are selected and appointed by the
president.
	   Miriam also said that the present system could serve the
nation's needs if elections were implemented in a fair and just
manner.
	   She said that in the forthcoming polls the government should
abolish the ``floating mass'' policy which bans political activity
in districts and villages and should also allow civil servants
freedom to vote for whichever party they want.
	   Civil servants are currently required to vote for Golkar.
	   Both Miriam and Mochtar seemed inclined to support a
continuation of the proportional electoral system which they said
could better accommodate a multi-party system. A district electoral
system, they argued, would only benefit large parties.
	   ``In a district system, votes gained by candidates from a losing
party would not count for anything,'' Miriam said.
	   ``A district electoral system could be introduced after the next
election because by then there will have been enough time to
discuss the concept with the public,'' she added. (byg)

JAKARTA (JP): University of Indonesia medical students have

<TEXT>
given Minister of Health F.A. Moeloek one week to announce measures
to totally reform the country's healthcare system or resign.
	   ``If the minister fails to do this, we will ask him respectfully
to resign in order to protect the interests of the people,''
Sugisman, spokesman for the medical students, said at a free speech
forum yesterday.
	   The gathering criticized the government for placing an unfair
burden on those who required medical treatment by failing to
guarantee the availability of affordable medicine, and for paying
scant attention to ``the right to a healthy life.''
	   Sugisman, as quoted by Antara, said that rampant corruption,
collusion and nepotism in the Ministry of Health had resulted in
inefficiency and the mismanagement of funds and had caused the
price of medical care to rise.
	   Minister Moeloek, who was also in the gathering and wore a
headband written with ``Reform in Health'', welcomed the call and
said he would be ready to resign if he failed to launch reform in
his ministry.
	   He identified a number of priority areas, including securing the
availability of generic and essential medicines, and formula milk
for infants and children, for at least two years.
	   Moeloek, who is also a professor in the medical school at
University of Indonesia, said the ministry had opened a special
postal address, Post Box 5500, to receive complaints from the
public about irregularities in the ministry's operations.
	   ``All complaints will be followed up on,'' he promised at the
gathering which was also attended by ministry secretary-general
Hidayat Hardjoprawito and inspector-general Roesmono.
	   The students were the second group to demand reform in the
health sector. On Monday, a group of doctors and non-governmental
organization (NGO) activists demonstrated against the poor policies
which have caused medicines to rise in price.
	   The group also alleged that the Yayasan Harapan Kita foundation
had ``looted'' Harapan Kita Maternity Hospital and Cardiac Hospital
Harapan Kita on regular basis.
	   The foundation -- established by Ibu Tien Soeharto, the late
wife of former president Soeharto -- allegedly took billions of
rupiah from the hospitals' earnings every month. (swe)

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - A despatch boy was sentenced to a year's

<TEXT>
jail by the Sessions Court today for four counts of cheating with a
forged credit card. Hae Fook Ting, 37, pleaded guilty to two counts
of deceiving Agnes Yap, an employee of Syarikat Cerruti 1881, into
believing that a credit card for purchase of items worth RM1,625
and RM1,475 respectively was genuine.
	   He admitted committing the offences at Cerutti 1881, VG3, upper
ground floor, Star Hill Shopping Centre, Jalan Bukit Bintang at
3.31pm and 3.39pm respectively on Jan 13.
	   He pleaded guilty to deceiving another Cerutti employee Mohd
Hasle Sani into believing that a credit card for purchase of items
worth RM2,040 was genuine at the same place at 3.33pm on the same
day.
	   Hae also admitted to cheating an employee of Designer Forte,
Sahibul Ikram Mohd Salim, by deceiving him into believing that a
credit card for the purchase of items worth RM2,427.20 was genuine.
	   He committed the offence at Designer Forte, Metro Jaya, City
Square, about 8.20pm on the same day.
	   Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman sentenced Hae to one year's jail
for each count and ordered the sentences to run concurrently.
	   In mitigation, defence counsel Sundra Siva Masilamani said this
was Hae's first offence, adding, that his client was married and
had a one-year-old child.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul Rahim Mohd Noor called for an
appropriate sentence as credit card forgery was on the rise.

court.
	   She was wearing her father's ring around her neck, as she has
all tournament long. Karolj Seles died May 14 of cancer.
	   Hingis, who all week had played brilliantly, seemed unable to
cope with Seles' power. Normally composed on court, she was reduced
to scolding herself and bouncing her racket on the clay in
frustration.
	   In the first set, Seles broke Hingis for a 3-2 lead, hitting two
backhand winners in a row.
	   The players stayed on serve until 5-3, when Hingis twice
double-faulted to give Seles a 0-40 lead. A point later, Hingis
netted a weak backhand into the net to end the set.

JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid was

<TEXT>
reported by Kompas daily as making three salient points in a
statement on Tuesday, May 26:
	   The various new political parties that have been proclaimed
lately have no legal existence currently. For now, the government
recognizes only the three existing political organizations: the
Indonesian Development Party (PPP), dominant Golkar grouping and
Soerjadi-affiliated Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
	   Later on, after the revised laws on political parties and
general elections have been approved and officially adopted, the
existence of these and other new political parties will be
officially recognized. By that time Megawati Soekarnoputri, the
former PDI leader toppled by Soeharto's government, can have her
own new political party, besides the PDI of Soerjadi.
	   For the sake of the development of democratic culture, it is
best that Soerjadi and Megawati join forces, and the government
will not intervene again. ``Intervention is a thing of the past.''
	   I felt dismayed and dejected. This statement is, of course,
legally quite correct, but is it politically and psychologically
wise?
	   It should be noted in this regard that the three political
organizations now still enjoying legality are the very
organizations which collaborated with the Soeharto regime in
destroying democracy in our society.
	   These organizations are icons of the old New Order, and they
must still undergo total reform. Their legality was given by a
regime that is now defunct. Why is such a defunct legality
emphasized?
	   I am not quite sure whether Syarwan's remarks were an
institutional statement of the Ministry of Home Affairs or a
personal opinion.
	   Whatever the case, it reflects a belief in reform which is
skin-deep.
	   The suggestion that Megawati can form her own political party
alongside the PDI of Soerjadi is another reflection of the old
regime mentality.
	   It is derived from a firm belief that the Soerjadi-PDI is the
legal party, and Megawati's an illegal division. The entire nation
knows from the outcome of the 1996 general election which one of
these two parties really has roots in the society. Holding firmly
to the belief that the Soerjadi-PDI is the legal party and the
Megawati-PDI a clandestine organization is to defend a position
clearly from an antireform political attitude.
	   The third item in the statement is a very shameless one. It says
that for the sake of developing a democratic culture, it is best
that Soerjadi and Megawati (please note the order the names were
mentioned) join forces, and that the government will then keep its
hands off its affairs.
	   The final part -- intervention is a thing of the past -- is an
admission that it was the government which split the PDI into two
competing archrivals.
	   Most tellingly, I think, is that it is still fresh in the public
mind what Syarwan's role was as the then chief of social and
political affairs of the Armed Forces in this entire political
melodrama.
	   Has a person with such a political record the moral right to
speak on the development of democratic culture? Has such a person
the moral right to advise Megawati, a staunch defender of
democracy, to join forces with Soerjadi, a rapist of the
institution, for the sake of developing a democratic culture?
	   This particular story is undeniable evidence to me that nowadays
just about everybody in our society, even those who in their heart
still oppose reform, can claim to be a supporter of reform.
	   It is only when we examine closely the language that a person
employs in talking about reform can we see the distinction between
those who are true believers and those who are still captives of
the old political and social mentality.
	   The latter category of people knows at best only the vocabulary
of reform.
	   I once listened to off-the-cuff remarks of the present chief of
staff for social and political affairs of the Armed Forces, Lt.
Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. He was talking about the Armed
Forces' concept concerning the purpose and design of our current
reform movement. After listening to one sentence, I immediately
believed that this was a general who really understands the grammar
of reform.
	   Sentence after sentence went by without any grammatical mistake
as far as reform is concerned. And after listening to the entire
episode which lasted only about three minutes, I am convinced that
this general also understands the idiom of reform.
	   In no single instance did he reveal any trace of the language
and logic of the old regime. When he mentioned that our current
reform is an avenue toward a new Indonesia, he demonstrated an
entirely new idiom which was never used before by anybody in the
establishment.
	   And when he talked about the link between our current reform and
reviving our national sense of humanity, he demonstrated
convincingly that reform is for him not merely a political
phenomenon, but that behind its political manifestations it is
basically a cultural renaissance of our nation.
	   Reform is a word that has become too popular too soon. Used by
people who were outside the process of its formation, it tends to
become an empty declaration.
	   When used by those who, because of their value commitments, were

EQUINE PARK has been designed to provide an abundance of country

<TEXT>
charm with lots of city convenience.
	   As the name suggests, recreation is centred around an equestrian
theme with facilities for polo, showjumping and a wide range of
equine disciplines. Equine Park first and foremost, however, is a
property development project that has to make money for its
developer.
	   The development covers an area of 220ha located to the west of
the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Highway between the Sungei Besi and
Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) toll plazas. It is only a 20-minute
drive away from the city centre and 40 km away from the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in Sepang. It has been planned as an
integrated residential, recreational and commercial project to be
developed over a period of eight years in 11 phases with a
projected sales value in excess of RM600 million. The residential
component is to comprise bungalow lots, link houses and
`controlled-cost' apartments.
	   The bungalow lots range in size from 8,000 sq ft to 20,000 sq
ft, sold on a 99-year lease. In phase one, more than 200 lots were
offered for sale at prices ranging from RM32 per sq ft to RM36 per
sq ft. Under phase two, another 235 lots with prices ranging from
RM36 per sq ft to RM46 per sq ft are being planned.
	   How has the economic downturn affected Equine Park executive
chairman Datuk Patrick Lim Soo Kit's plans for the bungalow
development? `We have had to take a long hard look at our proposals
and adjust our plans. Of course the nature of the development
cannot be altered as we want to keep our promises to our buyers,'
he says. As with a couple of other `bungalow-plot' developers,
Equine Park has had to introduce special `payment holiday' schemes
to `help' buyers realise their plans. Equine Park is marketing the
development on the basis of an initial deposit, two years `payment
holiday' in which the buyer is expected to build a home on the
plot. `Its like having a ``put option'' on a home', says Lim.
	   Equine Park was also planned to have a unique link-homes design.
The homes were to have been built in two parallel rows divided by a
common landscaped courtyard-cum-driveway. Landscaped park spaces
would have been located at either end of the courtyard. The
economic downturn has meant that these plans have to be revised as
demand for such homes have virtually dried up.
	   Lim planned Equine Park with affordable housing in mind. Some
1,500 units of `controlled-cost' apartments will be built on 12ha
set aside for this purpose, with 40 per cent of the residential
units being low-cost apartments. The homes range in price from
RM40,000 to RM80,000. This portion of the development - called
Putra Permai - was launched recently and is expected to be
completed in two years.
	   Befitting its location within the MSC, residents of Putra Permai
will have easy access to information technology. So-called `IT
centres' will be equipped with up to 40 computers which will have
direct access to the Internet and the Universiti Putra Malaysia
data bank. Putra Permai has the distinction of being the first low-
and medium- cost housing project whose developer provides IT
facilities.
	   Equine Park's main commercial element is the Equine Business
Park which is in two adjacent plots closest to Equine Park's main
access points. A landscaped and paved pedestrian mall separate the
two distinct sections, giving an air of informal conviviality.
Equine Business Park comprises 16 plots of office blocks measuring
5.38ha. It has been designed to be the definitive working
environment of the future. The Business Park will have a
state-of-the-art, hassle-free working environment where its
inhabitants can work and play in a stress-free environment. A major
coup for Lim was securing the interest of BMG-Warner Music which
plans to build its new corporate headquarters in Equine Park.
Leaseholders are given a greenfield plot to do as they please,
within specified guidelines. These include a height restriction
where buildings are to stand no taller than eight stories.
`Businesses at Equine Park will be distinguished by having an
individual identity as no two premises will be alike,' says Lim.
Another distinguishing feature is the wide open spaces available as
the plots are sold as individual lots and developed singly by the
buyer. `We are targeting multinational companies as well as listed
companies to set up a presence in the park,' says Lim. He envisages
tenants in the park to operate in modern buildings behind hi-tech
glass panelled facades with lush green lawns.
	   Rental rates for premises at the park have been set at between
RM2.50 to RM3.00 per sq ft depending on size. Leasehold buyers pay
anywhere from RM150 per sq ft upwards depending on the finishes and
specifications. `We offer to build the office blocks to designs
specified by any purchaser or tenant subject to our guidelines,'
says Patrick.
	   Another plot measuring more than 65,000 sq meters has been set
aside for a proposed hospital and hotel development. As Taman
Equine Sdn Bhd is only in the business of property development, it
will most likely offer established parties in the field complete
independence to develop and carry out the operations side of its
businesses.
	   Being located in a forest reserve, residents in Taman Equine
have a 12ha nature park to call their own. The portion of land
closest to the bungalow and commercial lots has been set aside by
Taman Equine to serve as a living nature classroom. `We encourage
hiking and trekking into the jungle where one can appreciate our
flora and fauna in its natural state,' he says.
	   With a comprehensive residential mix, top class recreational
opportunities for the masses, commercial and retail facilities,
health and catering services and ample security provisions, Equine
Park stands as a model development for others to emulate.

In view of the economic crisis, which is a great burden to

<TEXT>
citizens and business people alike, I suggest that the minister of
finance review all insensible and inefficient regulations,
including: 1) abolish the fiscal (exit) tax for Indonesians and
foreign nationals residing in Indonesia; and 2) abolish the export
tax for cooking oil, crude palm oil, and improve the quality of the
apparatuses to prevent exporters from breaking the regulations.

YOUR editor's note Merging Financial Institutions (MB, March 1

<TEXT>
issue) spoke bravely on this pressing matter.
	   What choice have we now except to make such institutions big,
strong and friendly, and the sooner the better. We do not want to
see banks going bust before we act. The government, being pragmatic
and realistic about this matter, has issued a directive, and every
party involved must get its act together and get cracking.
	   We have no time to waste as we have seen the liquidity problem
already surfacing in some banks. So, we have to act fast before the
public's confidence in such financial institutions is lost.
	   Tough times call for tough solutions. Let us do the right thing
and merge these financial institutions. Although some have started
to do so, things aren't moving at the speed they should. This
cannot be allowed. The bigger the institution, the more competitive
and solid it would be. The financial sector must begin to
distinguish the woods from the forest and understand that there is
light at the end of the tunnel after all. We have to breeze through
this long cold winter, and this can only be done when our financial
institutions are big and mighty.
	   What about our stock broking firms? They too need clout to
handle their clients. So, merge them too! Remember, unity is
strength and for now the solution is to get together and tighten
the reins. It is a matter of survival.

I am aware that my following suggestions are nothing new and

<TEXT>
that many have written to the media on the same subject. However,
to show that I am very supportive and willing to be asked to take
concrete steps, if need be, so that the suggestions can be
realized, I request that this letter be published.
	   In the legal field:
	   1. Revocation of the Subversion Law, not a review as suggested
by President Habibie. The Subversion Law has often been manipulated
by officials to avoid correction/criticism from the people with the
excuse that it creates unrest in the community. The law has a
colonial heritage. If it is not revoked, it would mean that the
government has colonized its citizens, and political manipulation
by the government/officials would prevail again.
	   2. The liberation of all political prisoners.
	   3. An investigation into the kidnapping of activists. The
findings should be published. The people involved, including those
who issued the orders, must be brought to court.
	   In the political field:
	   1. The dissolution of the Indonesian Civil Servants Corps
(Korpri). Then, allowing government officials the freedom to
channel their aspirations to existing political parties and labor
organizations. Women's organizations connected with government
agencies, like Dharma Wanita, also should be dissolved.
	   2. Reconsider the necessity of the dual function of the Armed
Forces (ABRI). Although ABRI is from and for the people, it must
return to its function as guardian of the state, not as guardian of
the government/people in power. It would be better if ABRI played
the role of its counterparts in democratic countries, i.e. a
professional military that does not take the side of any group.
	   3. To hold a general election as soon as possible (not more than
six months from now), then to convene the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) to elect a president and vice president. To prevent
engineering, a regulation must be laid down that presidential/vice
presidential candidates must number more than one and elections
must be done by closed voting.
	   4. To invite nonindigenous professionals and experts for
ministerial and governmental posts so that their expertise can
benefit the nation.
	   5. To abolish appointments of MPR members by the government.
	   In the economic field:
	   1. To give equal opportunity to all groups to conduct business
and to avoid making racist regulations.
	   2. To intensify the collection of taxes, duties, excise, etc.
and to introduce regulations that impose heavy sanctions against
tax manipulation. It should apply not only to taxpayers, but
especially to tax officials and collectors. To oblige tax officials
and those responsible for collections, at certain levels in the
hierarchy, to report their wealth.
	   3. To pass an antimonopoly law, including the prohibition of
certain workers' cooperatives to conduct business connected to the
authority of the concerned agency or with the backing of the
agency.
	   4. To establish a natireign companies (not foreign companies
owned by groups themselves in Indonesia) are conducted fairly in
accordance with mutually approved agreements.

thank you for printing the official reaction of Indonesia's
government over the Pakistan's nuclear device tests conducted a few
days ago, as appeared on May 30, page 2, Indonesia regrets
Pakistan's tests.
	   However, in order to provide a clearer picture of the issue to
your readers, I would like to pinpoint a minor correction in the
latter part of the article. The last sentence should read ``...we
are of the opinion that national security policy should be pursued
without the use of nuclear arms,'' instead of ``...we are of the
opinion that national security policy should be pursued without the
use of arms.''

PUTTING IN 30 years of work in a software package is a daunting

<TEXT>
task for anyone. Especially if the subject is as mind-numbing as
the Malaysian Labour Law.
	   But Latiff Sher Mohamed, 56, chief executive of SMPD Management
Consultants Sdn Bhd, can now say that he's done his bit at
promoting good industrial practice with the launching of the
Malaysian Labour Law Wizard; a databank of sorts on the Malaysian
Labour Law.
	   But it is more than just that. The Malaysian Labour Law Wizard
is a software package (available in both CD-ROM and diskette
formats), containing every single question, answer and document
operational managers need to make them more effective. The
achievement is all the more sweet because it was a collaborative
effort between father and son. The man behind the concept and
design of the software is his own son, Shawn Sher, a consultant at
SMPD. `Shawn did most of the work,' says Latiff, beaming with
pride. Apart from being an authority on the subject, Latiff is also
the author of 37 books, including the best-selling Manual on
Malaysian Labour Laws and Industrial Relations and 600 Questions
and Answers on Malaysian Labour Laws. `He made me come up with
another 400 questions for that section on the software. I thought
600 questions were enough, but no; he wanted more,' says the
soft-spoken man, laughing.
	   Latiff says that the feedback from companies was tremendous.
`Managers often regard labour laws as so complicated that they
become overwhelmed.
	   We got a lot of input from companies to keep it simple. We
wanted to give managers a tool to make the subject more
accessible,' he says, adding that great care had been taken to make
sure that the language was easy to understand. `We also made sure
that we didn't oversimplify matters.' But he insists that the
software should not be regarded as `ammunition' for management.
`Contrary to popular belief, we're very much pro-labour in this
country. What we want to achieve with this software is to promote
good industrial practice. We want to educate managers on the proper
procedures and on what can and cannot be done.' Shawn adds that its
use can be extended to those in the Human Resources Ministry,
unions, centres for higher education, non-governmental
organisations and so on.
	   The need for a such a software cannot be understated. Imagine
having to deal with an extremely difficult employee; one who comes
in whenever he or she feels like it, one who piles up sick leave
like it's some kind of Brownie points to be redeemed at the local
supermarket check-out counter, and one who swears like a
longshoreman. As a manager, you've done your best to counsel,
advise, plead, beg, cajole and slot in the occasional threat or
two, but nothing seems to work. What are the options left open to
you?
	   You might want to check out the Malaysian Labour Law ... until
you realise that they come in volumes the size of phone
directories. Looking for the relevant sections will take days, if
not weeks, and once you find what you're looking for, there's still
the matter of cutting through the legal morass.
	   Interpreting court judgements can also be a problem and this is
reflected in the number of wrongful dismissal claims handled by the
courts each year. `Companies that are not careful stand to lose out
in terms of industrial actions taken against them. Last year, for
example, local companies paid an average of about RM55,000 per
wrongful dismissal,' says Latiff. In fact, adds Latiff, the number
of cases for the first three months of this year shot up by a
staggering 250 per cent compared with the same period last year.
	   Latiff says that the reason this happens is because managers and
administrators do not have information on labour laws at their
fingertips.
	   `It's a tricky subject,' he says. `A lot of times, managers are
unable to take action against employees because invariably, the
first question that pops up is, ``Where do I begin?'',' says Shawn.
	   He wanted to come up with a software that answered most of the
questions pertaining to labour issues, and which was easy to use
with simple pull- down menus and mouse-driven commands. The
finished product is so simple that there is no need for a manual.
Every question a user might have is covered by the Help feature.
`That was the design challenge. How do we make it so simple that
someone with minimal computer knowledge can master it in less than
a day.' During the interview with Malaysian Business, Shawn gave a
demonstration of the software and wrapped it up in less than five
minutes. Anyone using Windows 95 will find using the software as
easy as pie. And the beauty of the software is that it only needs
30 megabytes of space to run, allowing older machines to handle it.
	   The software is divided into four headings - questions and
answers, documentation, action taken and reports. Sections of the
Labour Laws and Industrial Court Awards can be accessed by topic
for easy referencing. The questions and answer section is
invaluable because a user may be confronted with the same situation
listed in this section. The topics are sub-divided into different
categories, ranging from absenteeism to late- coming to the use of
foul language and so on.
	   After the case or scenario is established, the user might want
to look up previous cases to see what the judgements were. Here,
the landmark cases are given, listing those involved in the issue
at hand, the presiding judge, the section which applied to the case
and the outcome of the proceedings. The cases cited have references
up till the end of 1997.
	   Once that is done, flow charts map out the next course of
action.
	   Showcause letters may have to be given out. But for some,
writing letters and reports may be tougher than brain surgery.
	   Realising this, the design team also incorporated a useful
feature.
	   Click under Reports and the standard formats for a wide variety
of letters - from letters of reprimand to showcause letters - are
displayed.
	   The manager now only needs to fill out the particulars of the
case and if he so wishes, add to or delete certain parts of the
letter, depending on the situation. If the workstations are linked,
the manager only has to press a key and copies will be transmitted
to the human resource department (HRD) for approval. If the HRD
gives the green light, the manager can then send a copy to the
employee in question.
	   Keeping track of the employee's performance or the course of
action can be done by pressing the Action Taken taskbar. Now, it's
a simple case of just filling out the details of the case - how
many warning letters issued, the dates, developments and so on. The
information is stored under various categories - topics, employees
and departments.
	   `You eliminate time, paperwork and so far, the manager is in
control of the situation. We all know how bogged down HRDs can get
at times. What we've done is given the manager greater autonomy,
but we have not taken the HRD out of the loop. We've simplified
their job because now they can concentrate on the bigger picture,'
explains Shawn.
	   Access to the more than 100 documents in the software are well
protected. By selecting the Password option, unauthorised users can
be prevented from being privy to the system. Any amendments and
updates to the labour laws can be easily incorporated for a small
fee. `It will be reasonably priced and would depend a lot on the
amendments made. Normally, they aren't all that big and it's not
something you change every week,' he quips.
	   A team of between six and eight programmers worked on the
project. Shawn says that the better period of the entire project,
which spanned one year, was taken up with conceptualising it.
`Programming was the easy bit. We wrapped things up within six to
eight months.' The major part of the work, sourcing for materials,
was also made easy since most of the groundwork had already been
done. They just went to Latiff.
	   SMPD is a management consultancy company, focusing on human
resource.
	   Its core business is in restructuring company manpower levels
and it supplements that with management training, recruitment
services and industrial relations consulting. The Malaysian Labour
Law Wizard is not the first software designed and developed by the
company. It started its foray into the software business back in
the early 80s with the introduction of the first human resource
information system, allowing companies to keep track of their
employees more efficiently. The company followed up on its success
with the introduction of the Malaysian payroll system and a time
management system.
	   SMPD is also working on other modules, including those on
recruitment, manpower planning and comprehensive skills inventory.
Since its inception in 1980, SMPD has built its client base to
around 600 companies. Turnover for its software business for 1997
was between RM4.5 million and RM5.0 million, making up 40 per cent
of its total business.
	   The software was launched by the chief executive officer of
Antah Holdings Berhad Tunku Tan Sri Imran Tuanku Jaafar recently.It
has a retail price of RM899 and can be obtained from the sole
distributor, Milestone Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd.

The article MPR should convene to pick new president by Yusuf

<TEXT>
Wanandi, May 29, arouses several questions and astonished me
regarding President B.J. Habibie's credibility and popularity. I
have no connection with B.J. Habibie except that he has been
elected President of Indonesia.
	   The writer is very biased, It is as if he has a personal dislike
for the president. Is it really true that the President has no base
power at all? As chairman of the Muslim Intellectual Organization
of Indonesia, there is no doubt he has the support of it's members.
I wonder what proof Yusuf Wanandi possesses to be able to state
that the president is a controversial figure and he is opposed by
many groups in Indonesia, and that the military leaders are not
happy with his presidency. He goes on to say that Indonesia's elite
does not support him and that he is also not trusted by the
financial market, etc.
	   Yusuf Wanandi's negative comments emanate solely from his
arrogance. What authority does he have to mention these negative
elaborations? The Armed Forces' chief, Gen. Wiranto, has pledged
full support for President Habibie. Congratulations and
recognitions from foreign countries are pouring in. Without giving
time for the President and his cabinet to prove themselves, it is
very absurd and eye-brow raising for Yusuf Wanandi to conclude that
the government cannot overcome the present difficulties.
	   The growing support for the government from various quarters of
the Indonesian community speaks for itself regarding the
credibility and legitimacy of the President and his cabinet. Hubert
Neiss of the IMF said recently that the present cabinet comprises
capable persons and figures of integrity.
	   As to the options proposed by the writer, they are totally out
of question. The appointment of B.J. Habibie as new president is
legal and legitimate according to article 8 of the 1945
Constitution. That Habibie did not make his oath in front of the
People's Consultative Assembly does not necessarily make his
appointment illegitimate. Due to the emergency situation at that
time, it was impossible for the Assembly to convene, but the oath
was taken by the chairman of the Supreme Court in the presence of
all vice chairmen.
	   In this case, the primary condition for transfer of the
presidency was fulfilled. The second option proposed by Yusuf
Wanandi is unconstitutional because it contravenes article 7 of the
1945 Constitution, where the president and vice president are
elected for a term of five years.
	   I must say that Yusuf Wanandi's article is quite disheartening
to me. Judging from it's contents, I am not surprised the article
has been published in the International Herald Tribune because most
foreign journalists are addicted to negative stories about
developing countries such as ours.
	   From Yusuf Wanandi, as chairman of the Supervisory Board of the
Centre for Strategic and International Studies, may I have the
pleasure of hearing the story of the student demonstrations at your
office some time ago?

MAKE SELANGOR an international equine centre - that is the lofty

<TEXT>
goal behind the setting up of the Royal Selangor Equestrian
Academy. The Akademi Ekuestrian Di Raja Selangor - to give it its
proper registered name - is first and foremost a community project
by Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd, developer of Equine Park.
	   It was established in November 1995 by Dr George Lim Ah Soo who
has the distinction of being the racing industry's first local
stipendiary steward. He died in 1996, but the work continues in the
capable hands of his son Datuk Patrick Lim Soo Kit who is
determined to make this equine dream a reality. `My dad wanted to
make this a centre of excellence for education, sports, recreation
and career development in equestrianism. He wanted the Sport of
Kings to be the pursuit of the masses.
	   `Anyone with an interest in equine sports or in equestrian
disciplines are welcome,' he says. Fittingly, the prodigal son has
named the centerpiece of the development the Dr George Lim Ah Soo
Equestrian Complex in memory of his father. The academy will occupy
a 12ha site within Equine Park.
	   It was to have a complete riding and working facility costing
approximately RM30 million. An indoor riding arena with a maximum
seating capacity of 8,000 spectators was also planned. A notable
feature of the 88,000 sq ft arena would have been its column-free
structure and sail-type multi-layered roof made from weatherproof
synthetic material. This plan has been deferred as the cost of the
fibreglass roofing material which has to be imported from Europe
has soared in price due to the economic downturn.
	   An outdoor riding arena and full-sized polo field is attached to
the indoor facility. Within the complex, there will be dormitories,
classrooms and library facilities, a veterinary block, stables,
feed and tack room. A 5.5km riding track is also attached. Just in
case the equine residents need medical attention, they can be
tended to in their air-conditioned sick boxes.
	   Lim says the academy will offer a comprehensive range of
on-campus courses. `Students will receive hands-on training on the
various aspects of equine practices, sports and recreation.
Dormitory facilities will enable them to undergo intensive live-in
training.' The academy has established educational links with
institutions of higher learning and research such as the Malaysian
Agricultural Research and Development Institute (Mardi), Universiti
Putra Malaysia (UPM), the Department of Veterinary Services and the
Malayan Racing Association.
	   Overseas linkages and collaboration include the Hartpury College
in Gloucestershire, England, Waranggatta Insitute of Technical and
Further Education in Victoria, Australia, and the Union Nationale
Interprofessionelle du Cheval in Paris, France.
	   Lim sees the areas of stable management, equine property
management, basic farriery and equine care as areas of development
in the equine industry which will be catered for by the academy.
	   Lim, an accomplished rider himself, knows the value of
equestrian achievement. He believes equestrianism is one area where
the Asian lack of physique is no bar to achieving excellence. He
says size is not the primary criterion in determining one's ability
to be in complete control over a tonne of flesh and muscle.
`Horsemanship is not about brute strength,' he says.
	   He adds that residents who look to riding purely as an
non-competitive sport have the chance to indulge in `hacking' round
Equine Park. `We will incorporate a hacking track which will allow
riders to ride their mounts at a steady walking pace, the whole day
if they wish,' says Lim.
	   Capt Mark Phillips' contribution? `Being a rider who's achieved
honours at World and Olympic levels, he brings an intimate
knowledge and valuable expertise to the academy,' says Lim. Their
association came courtesy of his father's connections in equestrian
circles. `When the academy idea was mooted, I resolved that only
the best brains were consulted. If you wanted a golf course built,
I expect you want Jack Nicklaus or Greg Norman to have a look at
it. In equestrian matters, no one came more highly recommended than
Mark,' says Lim.

It concerns me that in spite of very recent events, you would

<TEXT>
publish such an offensive and factually incorrect letter as that
from Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo, May 30.
	   To say that ethnic Chinese Indonesians are somehow to blame for
being attacked recently because of their siege mentality is to defy
logic. More than that, it encourages ignorance and prejudice, which
result in real victimization. It seeks to justify looters.
	   Sumarsono is quite wrong and Chen Hsueh Chuang (May 23) is right
--ethnic Chinese Indonesians did fight against the Dutch alongside
their brothers.

BANDUNG (JP): One of the main goals of political reform is to

<TEXT>
make Indonesia's party system more representative and democratic.
	   A political party system can be considered democratic if the
existing parties reflect the diversity of political aspirations in
society and have sufficient autonomy to influence and control the
governing process.
	   The present political party system, which consists of three
political parties: Golkar, the functional group; the United
Development Party (PPP); and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI),
is widely considered undemocratic because the political parties are
the result of political engineering by the ruling power. It is no
wonder that, after Soeharto's resignation, these parties have
tended to disintegrate and there is now a growing demand for the
establishment of new political parties.
	   It should be noted, however, that any party system should be
based on a clear and widely acceptable rationality. The rationality
of the present party system can no longer be maintained if we want
to build a democratic state.
	   During Soeharto's era, the ruling Golkar became an effective
instrument to win politically engineered elections in order to give
formal legitimacy to Soeharto's government.
	   As regards to the other two political parties, PPP and PDI,
there was always a systematic effort by the ruling power to divide
and rule them by manipulating their vulnerability to internal
conflict.
	   Thus, when Megawati Soekarnoputri managed to attract
increasingly popular support for PDI, Soeharto's government
immediately endorsed an extraordinary congress in Medan just to
topple her and appoint Soerjadi as the new PDI chairman.
	   Unfortunately, most of the government officials who helped
Soeharto in such a dirty game still hold prominent positions in the
present reform Cabinet.
	   This is precisely why Indonesia needs a new rationality on which
a more democratic party system can be based. Before formulating
such rationality, it is necessary to have a clear view on the
national political goals in the short and long terms.
	   All Indonesians would agree that the party system should reflect
the plurality of Indonesian people. But democracy should never be
promoted just for the sake of democracy. It is not an end in
itself. It is only an institutional mechanism or procedure to
achieve other national goals like economic welfare and social
justice.
	   Therefore, our eagerness to establish a democratic party system
should never sacrifice the need to have sufficient political
stability so that foreign investors do not hesitate to invest here.
	   It is very likely that more new political parties will emerge.
It remains to be seen how the new law on political parties will
accommodate people's diverse aspirations. Some normative and
practical suggestions can be put forward as input for the
establishment of such a law.
	   First, there must be a balance between two equally important
priorities: democracy and political stability.
	   The Indonesian government has been under increasing pressure
from the IMF to maintain political stability so that economic
recovery might soon be achieved. It would be wise if all political
groups put national interests above their respective sectarian
orientations. Democracy without discipline would only lead this
nation into a dark future.
	   Second, the era of political engineering and co-optation by the
government already belongs to the past. Let political parties grow
naturally without external intervention so that eventually we can
have more independent political parties.
	   It is now the people themselves who determine which political
parties should survive and deserve people's support. It is too
early to determine how many political parties we should have. In
any case, political parties should reflect the aspirations of major
political groups in society.
	   Third, we ought to realize by now that the absence of a
committed opposition party over a long period could lead to chronic
abuse of power by the government. The Indonesian political system
needs to institutionalize and strengthen public control through an
effective functioning of an opposition party.
	   Last but not least, let us end the practice of state corporatism
through which the government grants a monopoly of representation to
certain groups.
	   Indonesian journalists, for instance, may establish their own
independent association without being forced to become members of
the government-backed Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI).
	   Political standardization could hamper efforts to establish a
strong civil society as a precondition for a democratic state.
Hopefully, these ideas can be used as input for the establishment
of a new law on political parties.
	   The writer is the head of the school of international relations
at the Parahyangan Catholic University, Bandung.
	   Window: ...our eagerness to establish a democratic party system
may never sacrifice the need to have sufficient political stability
so that foreign investors might not be hesitated to invest their
money here.

PARIS: the set.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Hingis broke Seles in the opening game of the second set, after
five deuces. But Seles broke right back for 1-1, then broke Hingis
again in the fourth game for 3-1, and held for 4-1.
	   In the next game, Seles actually overruled the net judge, giving
Hingis her only ace of the match. They stayed on serve until the
final game, when Seles broke Hingis for the fifth time in the
match.
	   Seles won here three times in a row, from 1990-92 _ the first
woman to achieve that feat since 1937. Last year she lost to Hingis
in the semis.
	   In the day's other semifinal, Sanchez Vicario was at her gritty
and relentless best, defeating an error-prone Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Davenport, the No. 2 seed, hit her groundstrokes with power, but
had trouble keeping them inside the lines. She made 56 unforced
errors, with 34 in the second set. Sanchez Vicario had 29 the
entire match.
	   ``I know she was very tired, and I just had to just hang in
there,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, the No. 4 seed from Spain.
	   Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario made a great
effort to send back a high defensive lob. Davenport responded with
an overhead, but it sailed wide.
	   ``I always think you have a chance if you get the ball back,''
Sanchez Vicario said.
	   Davenport conceded she hadn't played well.
	   ``I guess I beat myself, but she kind of forced it on me,'' she
said.
	   In a match where service breaks were the rule, Davenport didn't
hold serve once in the first set, and held serve only twice in the
second. Sanchez Vicario held only twice in each set.
	   The Spaniard has had a long career at the top of women's tennis
and has won three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and 1994 French Opens
and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   Davenport, meanwhile, has never reached the final of a Grand
Slam tournament despite being ranked second in the world.
	   For a semifinalist, she has been indeed modest. Asked earlier in
the week if she felt overlooked, she replied, ``If I were a betting
person or a journalist, I'd overlook myself also.''
	   She described herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
A boring story.''

President B.J. Habibie's response to the nation-wide clamor for

<TEXT>
an investigation into the wealth of former president Soeharto, his
family and cronies is not the kind of action demanded by the
people. The investigation, as disclosed by Attorney General
Soedjono C. Atmonegoro in a studiously worded statement to the mass
media Monday, seems to be already defect by its design.
	   Although we welcome Soedjono's reaffirmation that rule of law
and the presumption of innocence will be upheld during the
investigation, we have doubts about the credibility of the
investigators.
	   The investigation is being conducted only by officials from the
attorney general's office in cooperation with related government
offices. Missing from the investigation team are auditors from the
Supreme Audit Agency and independent analysts with the technical
competence needed to look into numerous documents and complicated
financial reports to uncover the truth.
	   We are already all too familiar with the utterly poor record of
the attorney general's office in pursuing corruption cases. It was,
after all, subordinated to the wishes of Soeharto during his more
than 32 years in power. Although domestic and international surveys
have voted the Indonesian government as one of the most corrupt in
the world, very few major graft cases have so far been brought to
court.
	   The fact that Soedjono's statement did not mention anything
about President Habibie himself also adds to our doubts. We get the
impression that Habibie may escape the investigation altogether,
though he is widely reported to have built a vast array of more
than 80 businesses for his family. Many of these are based in Batam
island, a special economic zone southeast of Singapore which has
been under the virtual control of the Habibie family since the
mid-1970s. So far, Habibie has yet to produce documented evidence
belying media reports on what has been dubbed as ``Habibie Inc.''.
He has, instead, always imposed the burden of proof on his critics.
	   It is most urgent to quickly establish the credibility of the
investigation team from the outset to cool down the hurly-burly of
the current movement against nepotism, corruption, collusion and
crony capitalism. The fury directed against Soeharto, stoked by the
almost daily reports uncovering his huge business empire, may run
out of control to the degree that people may look to take the law
into their own hands.
	   We cannot afford this kind of frenzy because it would literally
affect just about every sector in the economy since it is being
discovered that Soeharto's family and cronies are engaged in
businesses ranging from satellite communications, power, toll roads
and document printing to oil and gas, transportation, food,
pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals and plantations, to name just a
few.
	   An indiscriminate dismantling of the Soeharto business empire,
which includes joint ventures with foreign investors from around
the world and companies listed on stock exchanges, could become a
disastrous distraction. We cannot afford such confusion, especially
now when the nation badly needs to revive the business sector,
attract new investments and woo ethnic Chinese businesspeople to
bring their capital back home. The banking industry, already
crippled under a huge burden of bad loans, could plunge into total
collapse in view of the extensive exposure of the Soeharto business
empire to private and state banks.
	   Soedjono did not elaborate on his investigation team's agenda,
but in view of the explosive allegations of pervasive corruption
against Soeharto, the attorney general should obviously give top
priority to probing the Soeharto family's wealth to ascertain
whether their riches -- estimated between US$20 billion and $40
billion -- were amassed through corruption and other forms of
malfeasance. Next on the agenda should be the riches and businesses
of President Habibie and his family. But most importantly, as we
asserted at the outset, the investigation team must be perceived by
the public as credible.
	   But to put the issue of nepotism, corruption, collusion and
crony capitalism into the right perspective, the attorney general's
investigation, which may take months or even years to complete,
should be separated from more urgent measures dealing with the
murky businesses which form a big chunk of Soeharto Inc. These
measures should fall under the reform actions being taken by
various ministries, state companies and local administrations to
improve overall economic efficiency and create a level playing
field for businesses.
	   The government and state companies could simply refer to
existing laws and regulations in dealing with or abolishing
monopolies, cartel-like businesses, rent-seeking practices, special
favors and licenses, tax exemptions and contracts awarded without
competitive bidding. After all, these kinds of shady deals are
clearly market distortions which are supposed to be abolished under
the reform package agreed to with the International Monetary Fund.

A MONTH ago, Kelang Container Terminal Bhd (KCT) held its 13th

<TEXT>
annual general meeting, an event which reminded observers of how
far the country's ports have progressed. KCT is the country's
pioneer involved in the port privatisation exercise in 1986.
	   In the 12 years since KCT's entry into the scene, considerable
changes have taken place in the size of the container business at
Port Klang and the operating environment in Malaysia's main gateway
port.
	   KCT managing director and chief executive officer Abdul Samad
Mohamed points out that 1998 marks the 25th anniversary of Port
Klang's emergence as a port offering dedicated container terminal
services. It was in 1973 that the newly commissioned facility began
receiving calls from purpose-built container ships serving the
international trade routes. The event placed Port Klang among the
early group of Asian ports that responded to the changing
technology in the shipping industry.
	   Since then, these ports have gone ahead to chart their own
history of success, some more impressive than others. `For Port
Klang, the picture has been weighted more in terms of success than
failure. The port even created history of sorts when the government
used it as a test-bed for some radical and pioneering changes and
reforms, which many countries have not ventured to take beyond the
study stage,' says Abdul Samad.
	   The government's decision to license more than one container
terminal operator to create competition was yet another milestone
that is unique to Port Klang, he says. `This calls for adjustments
in the way we deal with the market place and devise our business
strategy.' He says KCT is aware of the increasing importance of
transshipment trade through Port Klang and the efforts of all
quarters to make this successful. This is a spin-off from the
emergence of more direct-call services of leading shipping
companies that provided the crucial main-haul bridge for
transshipment connections.
	   `As a terminal operator we have been directly involved in the
pooled efforts of several quarters including the government and the
port authorities,' he adds. Overall, Port Klang has undergone a
wide array of changes and taken on a new character. Today, it is a
transshipment port of considerable standing apart from maintaining
its role as the key gateway port of Malaysia, servicing more than
55 per cent of the total containerised trade of the country.
	   Abdul Samad says KCT has an installed capacity to deal with 1.25
million TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units) per year. The total
installed capacity of the three terminal operators in Port Klang
stands at 3.5 million TEUs per year.
	   Abdul Samad says the total containerised trade on a nationwide
basis covering Port Klang, Penang, Pasir Gudang (Johor), Kuantan,
Bintulu and the state ports in Sabah and Sarawak stood at 3.012
million TEUs in 1997, an increase of 17.93 per cent against the
previous year's 2.554 million TEUS (see table).
	   Containerised trade in 1997
	   Port Total volume Percentage
	   (TEUS)
	   Port Klang 1,684,508 55.92%
	   Penang 506,863 16.83%
	   Johor 429,448 14.26%
	   Kuantan 54,855 1.82%
	   Ports of Sabah 154,693 5.13%
	   Ports of Sarawak 181,817 6.04%

Butcher and Atherton hit fifties in England's 151-0
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with tea score
  By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Mark Butcher and Mike Atherton
Thursday shared a century stand as South Africa's decision to send
England into bat backfired on opening day of the first cricket test
at Edgbaston.
	   Butcher and Atherton both hit half centuries to take England to
151 for no loss at tea, bluntly defying the much-vaunted pace
attack led by Allan Donald.
	   A heavily overcast morning persuaded Hansie Cronje to send
England in first, but once the pair survived the first hour,
batting became easy on a drying, sparsely grassed pitch.
	   The openers slowly but steadily ground out the six-man attack
deployed by Cronje and helped themselves to the first century stand
by an English opening pair against South Africa since Bob Barber
and Geoff Boycott put on 120 at Kingsmead, Durban, in 1964-65.
	   It was also only the second opening century stand against the
Proteas by any test team since their readmission to test cricket.
The Pakistan pair Aamir Sohail and Saeed Anwar put on 101 at
Kingsmead earlier this year.
	   Atherton was the first to reach his 50 despite being out-scored
in the first 32 minutes of the day by left-hander Butcher.
	   It took the former England captain 23 minutes to score his first
runs, playing and missing during the initial seven-over spell by
medium paceman Shaun Pollock. He scored his first runs by edging
Pollock to the third-man boundary for the first of his eight fours
in his 193-ball innings.
	   Atherton, who stood down in winter after a record-52 tests as
captain, survived three confident appeals for leg before wicket,
but Zimbabwe umpire Russell Tiffin stood firm, denying South Africa
any success before lunch.
	   Donald, who considers Edgabston as his second home after playing
county cricket for Warwickshire for more than a decade, struggled
for direction as he strived for extra pace on a slow pitch.
	   Pollock was the more dangerous of the two opening bowlers,
swinging the ball alarmingly until the sun broke through menacing
clouds that hung around for most of the morning.
	   Atherton, playing his 80th test and the first since
relinquishing the captaincy, scored his 35th half century in three
hours, while Butcher's third half century was his first in 15
innings since his 51 against Australia at Manchester in 1997.
	   Butcher took the attack to Donald in his third over, hitting him
for two boundaries but soon settled down to play second fiddle to
Atherton, who grew in confidence after an uncertain start.
	   Butcher, lucky to win test selection after an ordinary tour of
the West Indies early this year, straight drove medium paceman
Lance Klusener for his four boundary to reach his 50.

BOGOR (JP): The chilly weather at the Tri-S Tapos ranch run by

<TEXT>
Soeharto's children in the hills around Ciawi south of here could
not lift the tension that descended after last week's invasion by
dozens of local residents.
	   This week, everyone -- including local villagers -- wanting to
use a road passing through the 751-hectare site were stopped and
questioned by uniformed military officers.
	   ``We can no longer cross the road to get to Pancawati village
freely,'' Rosadi of Citapen village, which is located at the
entrance gate of the ranch, told The Jakarta Post.
	   ``The security personnel always stop and inspect everyone,
particularly ojek (motorcycle taxi) drivers and passengers, who is
trying to pass through.
	   ``But we're determined to get through (by ignoring the military
inspection),'' he said.
	   When the Post tried to obtain military permission to meet
executives of the ranch management, PT Rejo Sari Bumi, one of the
officers replied harshly: ``None of them are here today. We're
assigned here only to safeguard this area.''
	   He then left immediately.
	   A civilian guard, Herman, then came and suggested getting
permits from the Bogor military district commander.
	   ``He's in power here,'' said Herman, a local resident who has
been hired as a security guard.
	   Rejo Sari Bumi, whose shares are owned by children of the
country's former president, started to develop the area in 1974.
	   Soeharto stated in his autobiography that he is only doing
agricultural and husbandry research at the ranch, where he often
used to spend weekends with families, friends, officials,
businesspeople and visiting foreign officials.
	   The ranch's main mission is to produce high-quality livestock,
which could be distributed across the country, he wrote.
	   But his resignation on May 21 led dozens of poor neighbors to
rush to the ranch and plant poles to claim plots of their own.
	   Residents' version
	   According to the residents, the land -- between 700 meters and
1,200 meters above sea level -- was owned and farmed by them until
1972.
	   ``Until then, we planted this area with a variety of crops, such
as bananas and cassava,'' recalled Aan of Cibedug.
	   The people's production was rudely interrupted one day when
bulldozers moved in and flattened the crops, he said.
	   ``We were not even informed about the condemnation, let alone
any compensation.''
	   The people could do nothing at the time.
	   ``We just felt that we were simple country folk,'' Aan said.
	   The villagers' return last week was ignited by the news of
Soeharto's resignation, Aan explained.
	   ``I don't know exactly whose idea it was. Suddenly, many people
flocked to the site and set up their respective borders,'' he
recalled.
	   According to Adul, another civilian hired to stay at the area
with his wife, four villagers came to him the day after Soeharto's
resignation, asking for the land.
	   ``I just told them that I'm just a worker here who was hired to
stay at the site and take care of the corn,'' the 64 year old
recalled.
	   Adul also explained to the people that the land was leased for
35 years from 1972 to Rejo Sari Bumi from the state, which had used
it to grow quinine trees.
	   On the next day, dozens of villagers packed the site and divided
the area into plots with sticks and plastic ropes.
	   The crowd were only willing to disperse peacefully the day after
that when a company executive, accompanied by security forces,
briefed the villagers about the ownership of the land.
	   ``The people finally left and never came back again,'' Adul
said.
	   According to one of the military officers assigned to safeguard
the ranch, a platoon of soldiers has been dispatched to the site to
face any possible invasion by the villagers.
	   The officer, who refused to be named, believed that his
superiors still thought that villagers might return and try to
occupy the ranch again.
	   ``If not, why do we have to stay here?'' he said.
	   The ranch is not the only property owned by Soeharto's children
in Bogor, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta.
	   Their other assets in the town included the 500-hectare Mekar
Sari fruit park, the 400-hectare Sentul motor racing circuit and
the 2,465-hectare Royal Bukit Sentul residential area.

Belarus moves to outlaw insults against authoritarian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Parliament moved Thursday to make it a
crime to insult President Alexander Lukashenko, who is the frequent
target of scorn at anti-government demonstrations.
	   The lower house of parliament gave preliminary approval to a
bill creating a new crime of slandering or insulting the dignity of
the president.
	   The bill, which passed 64-2 on its first reading, sets penalties
of four years in prison or two years of labor for insulting the
president. Lukashenko heads a Soviet-style government that has been
harsh on dissenters.
	   ``Encroachment on the honor and dignity of this person causes
damage not only for him but for the image of the whole nation,''
said Mikhail Myasnikovich, chief of the presidential
administration.
	   Protesters who insult Lukashenko are frequently arrested, but
until now they were charged with the lesser crime of violating
public order.
	   Before it becomes law, the bill must be approved a second time,
passed by the upper house of parliament, signed by the president
and published.

BOGOR (JP): Police are considering the release of three students

<TEXT>
suspected of killing a police officer, but insisted that their case
would be brought to court, an officer said yesterday.
	   Bogor Regional Police chief Col. Abubakar Nataprawira said he
would consider releasing the three Juanda University students from
police custody.
	   The move, however, would not mean that the charges against them
had been annulled, he said.
	   ``We'll continue the case in court,'' Abubakar said after
meeting with members of the National Commission on Human Rights,
lawyers and representatives of the university.
	   The police decision did not satisfy fellow students and the
university's rector.
	   After meeting with Abubakar, Juanda University rector Abadi
Soetisna urged the police to unconditionally free his students.
	   ``For the sake of the law and the nation, please release our
students. We are 100 percent sure that they are not guilty,'' Abadi
told reporters at the Bogor Police Headquarters.
	   Outside, hundreds of students staged a demonstration, demanding
the release of their friends, Emon Wahyudi, Tb. Ade and Syaifullah.
	   They pledged to continue their rally until the three were
released.
	   Charges
	   The three students could be charged under Article 170, Article
351 and Article 214 of the Criminal Code.
	   Article 170 on mobbing carries a maximum punishment of 12 years
in jail, Article 351 on torture carries a maximum penalty of two
years and eight months while Article 214 on fighting against
security officers carries a maximum punishment of 15 years in jail.
	   Commission member Clementino dos Reis Amaral said the police
would likely charge the students for mobbing since they had
allegedly caused injuries stipulated under Article 170 (2.1).
	   ``The police apparently decided not to charge the students with
murder,'' Amaral said.
	   The police has accused the three students of being involved in
the mobbing that led to the death of Second Lt. Dadang Rusmana,
head of the Bogor police intelligence unit, during a May 9 student
demonstration on the campus.
	   The accusations became controversial this week when forensic
expert Yuli Budiningsih, who performed the autopsy of the officer's
body, publicly disclosed that Dadang's death was caused by a heart
attack.
	   Amaral said the commission would discuss all new findings,
including the different explanations of death by police and
forensic experts.
	   He urged the police to immediately release the students and
bring the case to the court soon.
	   Torture
	   Amaral, who met the three students at the Bogor Police Precinct
yesterday, also said that the students had been tortured while
being detained.
	   In another related development, National Police spokesman Brig.
Gen. Da'i Bachtiar expressed concern over Yuli's decision to
disclose the postmortem results publicly before notifying the
police.
	   ``So the postmortem (result) should not be revealed to the
public. It must be given to the police first for further
investigation.
	   The investigation is done based on justice, and therefore, the
postmortem result cannot be disclosed until it is used in the
courtroom,'' Da'i said.
	   He said the postmortem was only one determining factor in
running an investigation. Other aspects, such as witness and expert
testimonies, hard evidence and defendant testimonies were needed to
build a case, he said.
	   Yuli, a forensic expert at the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI)
Hospital, said that there were no signs of torture on the body.
	   Abubakar, who is to be promoted to West Java deputy police
chief, yesterday asked another forensic expert, Mun'im Idries of
Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, for a second opinion on the
autopsy.
	   Mun'im said Yuli's public announcement over the autopsy result
was unethical.
	   ``The result is a legal matter. The autopsy was ordered by the
police and should be submitted to the police. It depends on the
police on how to use the result,'' Mun'im said.
	   The autopsy result could be examined by another forensic expert
who could have a different opinion, he said.
	   He reminded that an autopsy result contained two things: facts
and opinion.
	   He said the facts produced a conclusion which was a matter of
opinion. ``It's the conclusion that will become evidence in
court.'' (24/edt/jun)

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The European Union said Thursday that clashes on
the disputed border between Ethiopia and Eritrea are ``unacceptable
and could endanger regional stability and development'' in the Horn
of Africa.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that
after recent clashes, he spoke to both Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Eritrea's President Isaias Afewerki.
	   ``I urged both sides to find a solution by peaceful means, and I
stressed that the European Union fully supports mediation
efforts,'' said Cook.
	   Britain currently holds the presidency of the EU.

THE KUALA Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) is finally taking steps

<TEXT>
to ensure that remisiers are accorded some form of protection.
	   Persama president Richard Khoo in welcoming the introduction of
a standardised agreement between remisiers and broking firms, says
the new draft agreement is fair.
	   Remisiers have in the past - 12 years to be exact - been
pleading that they are getting a raw deal but their pleas seem to
have fallen on deaf ears. Until now.
	   In fact, talks between the remisiers' association, Persama, and
the KLSE have been going on for a long time. Although assurances
were given that the matter would be looked into, nothing concrete
had emerged to alleviate the woes of remisiers.
	   Unfortunately, it has taken the current stock market turmoil and
the problems at some broking houses to jolt the various parties
into action.
	   Let us hope the moves to introduce a standard agreement will be
expedited from now on. Several broking firms have come under
trading restrictions or ceased trading. The security deposits of
these remisiers now remain uncertain.
	   Continued lethargy on this matter could give rise to unhealthy
speculation about vested interests. After all, the KLSE comprises
of member broking firms and remisiers can only operate through a
broking firm.
	   Under the new agreement proposed, the security deposits of
remisiers are to be placed in a designated remisiers trust account.
Also, a broking firm must obtain the remisiers' permission before
withdrawing, selling or using any security deposits to settle money
that is owed.
	   Such requirements will go a long way to ease concern among the
remisiers on their security deposits. A standard agreement for all
broking firms would also pave the way for a more cordial and
beneficial remisier-broker relationship which is needed if the KLSE
aspires to attain world class status.
	   We should not wait for a crisis before taking corrective action.
It may then be too late.

JAKARTA (JP): The country's financial markets remained weak

<TEXT>
yesterday with the rupiah closing lower again against the U.S.
dollar and stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) down
1.7 percent.
	   Currency dealers said that hopes for the quick release of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-arranged loan for Indonesia did
not help boost market sentiment.
	   ``Despite hopes over the IMF funds, the market remains anxious
over the country's political situation,'' a dealer with a local
bank said.
	   The rupiah strengthened to 11,400 against the American dollar in
early trading, according to dealers, in response to the IMF First
Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer's statement that the fund
might resume the release of the fund ``reasonably soon'' to bring
Indonesia out of its economic catastrophe.
	   ``But the positive news on the IMF's loan disbursement was
overshadowed by the country's political uncertainty,'' the dealer
said.
	   Around 3,000 protesters, mostly students and supporters of
opposition figure Megawati Soekarnoputri, rallied outside the House
of Representatives building yesterday. They demanded that former
president Soeharto be tried for corruption and called on President
B.J. Habibie, who took over power from him last month, to quit.
	   Dealers said such political activity sent the rupiah down to
close at 11,750 against the American dollar in the Jakarta spot
market, slightly lower than its close at 11,600 the previous day.
	   Dealers said that trading on the rupiah was still moderate as
most market operators, who have taken a wait-and-see attitude, were
still digesting the country's political and economic programs to
improve its worst crisis in decades.
	   Dealers said that the rupiah was likely to continue to falter
against the greenback in the days ahead, particularly if the
political turmoil deteriorated.
	   ``If there are more demonstrations the rupiah will sink again,''
the dealer said, adding the currency might drop to as low as 15,000
to the U.S. dollar.
	   Stock prices on the JSX mirrored the currency's bearish trend
with the main price index falling 6.99 points to 392.60 points,
with 290.15 million shares worth Rp 300.37 billion (US$27.30
million) changing hands.
	   Stockbrokers said that the fall of blue chip stocks like PT
Telkom, Indosat and Tambang Timah, which are cross listed on
overseas exchanges and account for around 30 percent of the market
capitalization on the local bourse, and stocks linked to Soeharto's
family and cronies, led the fall.
	   ``Trading activities remain sober as most investors are still
scared to put funds into the local market,'' according to a broker
with Bali Securities.
	   Brokers said mounting market fear over a possible probe into
assets of companies linked to Soeharto's family and associates was
prompting most investors to dump the stocks.
	   The price of noodle maker Indofood Sukses Makmur, controlled by
the Salim group, a long-time ally of Soeharto, shed Rp 75 to Rp
1,075 on 33.65 million shares, the price of toll-road operator
Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada, controlled by Soeharto's eldest
daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, slid Rp 25 to Rp 350 on 9.35
million shares, while the price of cement maker PT Indocement
Tunggal Perkasa rose Rp 725 to Rp 3,600 on 1.6 million shares after
falling to an intraday low of Rp 2,800 and Bimantara Citra,
controlled by Soeharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo, rose Rp 25
to Rp 325 on 9.94 million shares traded.
	   An analyst with a local securities firm said that trading on the
local bourse would continue to remain sluggish until the IMF
disbursed its loan to Indonesia. (aly)

Marco Pantani powers up hills to win stage and retain lead
</HEADLINE>
  EDs: Will be updated  

<TEXT>
	   PLAN DI MONTECAMPIONE, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani powered his
way up grueling mountain passes Thursday, clinching the 19th stage
of the Tour of Italy and increasing his lead over rival Pavel
Tonkov.
	   The 239 kilometers (148 miles) ride, under scorching sun, took
its toll on race favorite Alex Zuelle of Switzerland, who lost
dozens of positions after dominating the initial stages of this
cycling classic.
	   Pantani, who captured the leader's pink jersey for the first
time in his career Tuesday, now holds a one minute, 28 second lead
over Russia's Tonkov with three days to go.
	   The 1996 Giro winner, Tonkov is stronger than Pantani in the
time trials and could catch the Italian in the final time trial
Saturday.
	   The 22-stage Giro ends Sunday in Milan.
	   ``I knew it was my last chance to make up time,'' said Pantani,
a climbing specialist. ``I tried my hardest and now we will see if
it was enough.''
	   Pantani, 28, who was sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a
broken leg, took over the leader's pink jersey from Zuelle during a
mountain stage.

JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed state general mining company PT

<TEXT>
Aneka Tambang announced yesterday its net profit for the first
quarter of this year was 15 times higher than for the commensurate
period last year, and marked a 162 percent increase over 1997's
total profit.
	   Company president Dedy Aditya Sumanegara confirmed the first
quarter profit of Rp 112.45 billion (about US$11.24 million)
outstripped the 1997 first quarter figure of Rp 7.56 billion, and
the Rp 69.52 billion for last year.
	   ``The windfall profit was caused by the fall in the rupiah's
value against the dollar and the success of the company efficiency
program,'' Dedy said after the annual shareholders meeting.
	   He said the average exchange rate for the rupiah was Rp 9,091
per dollar in the first quarter of the year, compared with the
average exchange rate of Rp 3,100 throughout last year and Rp 2,379
in the first quarter of last year.
	   Prices of several Aneka Tambang's products, including nickel and
gold, on the international market decreased in the first quarter of
the year compared to prices in the same period last year, Dedy
said.
	   But the company was able to increase its sales volume throughout
the period to maintain high earnings, he added.
	   The company's core business is ferronickel production, with its
major mining field located in Pomalaa, South Sulawesi. It also
mines gold, silver, bauxite and iron sand in many parts of the
country.
	   Dedy said the company exported 70 percent of its products and
most of its products sold domestically were also based onU.S.
dollar rates.
	   Dedy also said the shareholders meeting agreed to distribute 40
percent of its 1997 profit, or Rp 22.59 per share, as dividend.
	   The meeting also agreed with the company's plan to list its
shares outside the country.
	   ``Maybe, we shall list our shares in Australia by early next
year. Australia has a strong mining industry, (and) knows Indonesia
very well,'' Dedy said.
	   Aneka Tambang is now listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
	   Director of development Subagyo said the company would invest Rp
76.8 billion ($7.6 million) to modernize its 23-year-old first
ferronickle plant in Pomalaa starting in September.
	   The plant has production capacity of 5,500 tons.
	   The company would invest another Rp 281.4 billion to build its
third ferronickel plant also in Pomalaa with a capacity of 13,000
tons starting next year.
	   Several companies from Germany, Japan, the United States, Norway
and Britain are bidding for development and financing of the
project, Subagyo said.
	   Operation of the third plant will bring the company's
ferronickel output to 24,000 tons in 2001 from about 9,000 tons at
present. (jsk)

	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing two weeks after the death of her father,
Monica Seles jolted the French Open Thursday by beating Martina
Hingis 6-3, 6-2 to reach the final.
	   Seles, in a throwback to her championship days, scored a
convincing victory over the world's No. 1 player and will meet
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario for the title.
	   During the match, Seles drew inspiration from her family in the
stands at Roland Garros Stadium. As she has all tournament, Seles
wore her father's ring on a chain around her neck. Karolj Seles
died of cancer May 14.
	   ``It was really nice to share a win like this with them,'' Seles
said.
	   Seles served well, made few errors and most of all, painted the
lines with sizzling groundstrokes in her startling victory.
	   She had never beaten Hingis in their previous five matches. She
now advances to her first Grand Slam final since the 1996 U.S.
Open.
	   She hit a cross-court backhand winner past Hingis to close the
match, then clenched her fist. She tapped her racket and smiled as
she walked off the court.
	   ``It's quite amazing,'' she said.
	   Hingis, who all week played brilliantly, seemed unable to cope
with Seles' power. Normally composed on court, the Swiss star was
reduced to scolding herself and bouncing her racket on the clay in
frustration.
	   Hingis was hoping to move on and play for the only Grand Slam
title to elude her. Instead, Seles gets Sanchez-Vicario, a 6-3, 7-6
(7-5) winner over Lindsay Davenport in an earlier semifinal.
	   ``Everybody knows I can play better tennis than I played
today,'' Hingis said. ``Sometimes it's hard to keep concentrating
match to match.
	   ``Usually she makes one mistake. Today she didn't,'' Hingis
said. ``I just probably put too much pressure on myself. I really
want to win this tournament.''
	   In the first set, Seles broke Hingis for a 3-2 lead, hitting two
backhand winners in a row.
	   The players stayed on serve until 5-3, when Hingis twice
double-faulted to give Seles a 0-40 lead. A point later, Hingis
netted a weak backhand into the net to end the set.
	   Hingis broke Seles in the opening game of the second set, after
five deuces. But Seles broke right back for 1-1, then broke Hingis
again in the fourth game for 3-1, and held for 4-1.
	   In the next game, Seles actually overruled the net judge, giving
Hingis her only ace of the match. They stayed on serve until the
final game, when Seles broke Hingis for the fifth time in the
match.
	   Seles won here three times in a row, from 1990-92 _ the first
woman to achieve that feat since 1937. Last year she lost to Hingis
in the semis.
	   In the day's other semifinal, Sanchez Vicario was at her gritty
and relentless best, defeating an error-prone Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Davenport, the No. 2 seed, hit her groundstrokes with power, but
had trouble keeping them inside the lines. She made 56 unforced
errors, with 34 in the second set. Sanchez Vicario had 29 the
entire match.
	   ``I know she was very tired, and I just had to just hang in
there,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, the No. 4 seed from Spain.
	   Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario made a great
effort to send back a high defensive lob. Davenport responded with
an overhead, but it sailed wide.
	   ``I always think you have a chance if you get the ball back,''
Sanchez Vicario said.
	   Davenport conceded she hadn't played well.
	   ``I guess I beat myself, but she kind of forced it on me,'' she
said.
	   In a match where service breaks were the rule, Davenport didn't
hold serve once in the first set, and held serve only twice in the
second. Sanchez Vicario held only twice in each set.
	   The Spaniard has had a long career at the top of women's tennis
and has won three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and 1994 French Opens
and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   Davenport, meanwhile, has never reached the final of a Grand
Slam tournament despite being ranked second in the world.
	   For a semifinalist, she has been indeed modest. Asked earlier in
the week if she felt overlooked, she replied, ``If I were a betting
person or a journalist, I'd overlook myself also.''
	   She described herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
A boring story.''

Suspect admits to 1994 killing of French lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRAGUIGNAN, France (AP) _ A suspect on trial for the 1994
slaying of a lawmaker who crusaded against corruption on the French
Riviera admitted Thursday to shooting her from the back of a
motorcycle.
	   Yann Piat was shot three times on Feb. 25, 1994, as her
chauffeur drove her home in Mont des Oiseaux near the port city of
Toulon.
	   ``Yes, it was me who pulled the trigger. I fired six times,''
said Lucien Ferri, 26, who was arrested after the killing, along
with Marco Di Caro, the alleged driver of the motorcycle.
	   He gave no motive, and indicated he was only the trigger man.
	   Piat had campaigned against what she called ``a culture of
corruption'' in the region. She also likely made enemies by
switching from the far-right National Front to the conservative
Republican Party.
	   ``Today I have profound remorse,'' Ferri told the court, adding
that he was the only person to have been in contact with the people
who ordered the killing. He did not identify them.
	   ``I'm not scared for myself,'' he added. ``But I'm scared for my
family. There are some things I'll never be able to explain.''
	   Four other alleged accomplices are also on trial, as well as
Gerard Finale, 53, the alleged mastermind of the attack. The trial
began in May.
	   The murder of Piat is the subject of two controversial books
whose authors in each case have lost lawsuits this year.
	   One court ordered the authors and publisher of ``Yann Piat,
Assassins at the Heart of Power'' to pay about one million francs
(dlrs 167,000) for slandering former French Defense Minister
Francois Leotard and Marseille Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin, and remove
passages.
	   The book alleged Piat was killed because she was about to
disclose a plan to sell military land in southern France to the
mafia, implicated both officials in the murder.
	   A court also ordered passages removed from ``Yann Piat, Histoire
Secrete d'un Assassinat'' (Yann Piat, The Secret Story of an
Assassination) since the book made public details of the judicial
investigation.

that is set to change. Some three years ago, this Swedish
industrial conglomerate launched The World of Svedala campaign to
project itself on the world stage, placing emphasis on the Svedala

equipment and expertise in rock handling are called upon when the

formed into various fractions of crushed stone for a wide range of
applications. It is used as infrastructure materials to build
roads, bridges and airports. Here, Svedala's comprehensive range of
mechanical equipment, skills and expertise in compacting come to

world's leading supplier of mineral raw materials processing
equipment. In shipping and handling the minerals, Svedala offers
complete systems for loading, unloading and mixing at terminals or
harbours. Another area of Svedala's operations is service, which
includes aftermarket sales of wear and spare parts.

	   To get to know Svedala better, start by taking a closer look at
rocks.
	   Indeed, rocks form the base of Svedala's operations. Svedala's
equipment and expertise in rock handling are called upon when the
first blasting hole is drilled. From there, the blasted rock is
formed into various fractions of crushed stone for a wide range of
applications. It is used as infrastructure materials to build
roads, bridges and airports. Here, Svedala's comprehensive range of
mechanical equipment, skills and expertise in compacting come to
the fore.
	   Other parts of the rock are used for a variety of applications
in mineral processing. In this respect, Svedala ranks as the
world's leading supplier of mineral raw materials processing
equipment. In shipping and handling the minerals, Svedala offers
complete systems for loading, unloading and mixing at terminals or
harbours. Another area of Svedala's operations is service, which
includes aftermarket sales of wear and spare parts.
	   Svedala was founded in 1987, as part of Trelleborg-Trellex,
involved in sales of replacement parts to quarry and mining
companies. Since 1988, Svedala has, in turn, acquired about 100
companies, many having between 50 and 100 years of industrial
experience in their respective areas of expertise. These companies
have been restructured and integrated into the Svedala Group with
the parent organisation called Svedala Industri AB, headquartered
in Malm'', Sweden.
	   Today, Svedala Industri AB is a complete-coverage supplier to
the construction and mineral-processing industries. For the
construction industry, it manufactures products and complete
systems for the production of ballast (used in building highways,
railroads and airports), and macadam and sand (to produce asphalt
and concrete for dam and harbour projects). It lays claim to being
the world's leading manufacturer of equipment for processing
mineral raw materials, comprehensive metallic minerals (for the
extraction of metals), industrial minerals (for the recovery of
chemicals, fertilisers and precious mineral metals) and minerals
for producing energy.
	   The company's listing on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1990
provided it with direct access to the risk capital market for
financing larger acquisitions, and many of the companies acquired
have long established industrial experience and well-known
trademarks.
	   Svedala's aggressive acquisition strategy has made it one of
Sweden's fastest growing companies. The group is represented in 45
countries, including Malaysia, and has more than 200 service units
in various locations throughout the world. Annual sales have
increased to approximately SEK (Swedish Kroner) 15 billion from SEK
500 million in 1987, with 11,000 group employees. Markets outside
Sweden account for 95 per cent of sales. Svedala is mainly active
in the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
	   Thomas Older, Svedala's chief executive officer, states in the
company's 1997 annual report that he is optimistic about the
group's future development, saying Svedala is the only company able
to offer complete solutions, which means that customers can
eliminate several other suppliers whose product portfolios and
equipment are restricted to a limited range of product supplies.
`We have developed a structure, a platform, we can live with for a
long time. Acquisitions have become a matter of opportunity, not
necessity ... We do not just buy companies, we also divest, a
normal part of operations that contributes to earnings growth,' he
said. In 1997, Svedala's earnings per share was more than SEK 14.
	   Older refers to the downturn in the economic situation of
Southeast Asian countries as `quite serious temporary, a
parenthesis in continued growth throughout the region'. Svedala's
markets in this region account for three per cent of total group
sales.
	   The anticipated decline in copper requirement for domestic
demands in these affected markets corresponds to about one per cent
of world consumption. According to Older, a company assessment made
in February this year indicated that the shortfall in Asia will be
more than offset by a projected growth in Europe and North America
- provided the `Asian crisis' did not spread and create global
effects.
	   In 1997, order bookings in the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia and Thailand amounted to SEK 340 million, and sales to SEK
553 million.
	   (Other Asia-Pacific markets posted large increases in order
bookings and sales.) These countries are expected to experience a
sharply diminished demand in the construction industry, while
mineral processing is expected to remain unchanged. As a whole,
Svedala's sales in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to decline
this year.
	   Svedala aims to create local presence in its foreign markets
with its huge network of subsidiary companies, agents and
distributors. In late 1993, it established a wholly-owned
subsidiary in Kuala Lumpur, Svedala (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, which has a
branch in Kuching. However, Svedala (Malaysia) in not a `new'
company in the sense that its brand products -marketed under the
names Allis, Svedala Arbra, Faco, Goodwin Barsby, Dynapac, Robot,
Sala, Denver and Trellex - have been in the Malaysian market for
years.
	   According to Kang Hong Peng, the managing director of Svedala
(Malaysia), the Malaysian operation is responsible for markets in
Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam. A technical centre has
been set up in Kuala Lumpur to provide first-hand technical support
to customers, distributors and personnel in the Asian region. It is
manned by foreign and local product specialists.

JAKARTA (JP): An official hinted yesterday that the decade-long

<TEXT>
monopoly over fuel and crude oil imports held by companies
controlled by Soeharto's family and cronies had been granted on the
order of the former president himself.
	   Chief of the Development Finance Comptroller (BPKP) Soedarjono
said yesterday the body had once proposed to the House of
Representatives that Pertamina be allowed to import fuel and crude
oil itself to increase efficiency instead of hiring brokers, but
that Soeharto rejected the proposal.
	   ``'That's my responsibility' the (then) president (Soeharto)
said. As a government agency, we felt it was no longer our
responsibility to pursue that matter (monopoly) further,''
Soedarjono was quoted by Antara as saying at a news conference.
	   The news conference was held following public calls to dissolve
the comptroller since it has been considered ineffective given the
rampant corruption, collusion and nepotism during Soeharto's
32-year term as president.
	   The comptroller, which is in charge of auditing state finances
as well as state companies, is also seen as redundant since many of
its responsibilities overlap with the Supreme Audit Agency.
	   Soedarjono did not specify when the proposal to the House was
made but said it was suggested by Gandhi who headed BPKP between
1983 and 1993.
	   Pertamina has been obliged for decades to import crude oil and
fuel products through Perta Oil Marketing Ltd. and crude oil from
Permindo Oil Trading Co. Ltd.
	   Pertamina president Soegianto recently said in a letter to the
House that Perta was 30 percent owned by Pertamina, 20 percent by
Pertamina's pension fund, 25 percent by the Nusamba Group and 25
percent by Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra, alias
Tommy. Nusamba, controlled by Soeharto's friend Mohammad ``Bob''
Hasan, also includes foundations owned by Soeharto.
	   Permindo is 35 percent owned by Pertamina and 65 percent owned
by Mindo Petroleum. Mindo is owned by Bambang Trihatmodjo with a
14.1 percent stake, Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono (20.6 percent),
Soeharto's son-in-law Indra Rukmana (14.1 percent), Nirwan Bakrie
(22.8 percent), Syarief Sutardjo (7.6 percent), Mohammad Tachriel
Sapi'ie (7.1 percent), Rosano Barack (7.1 percent) and Aminusal
Amien (6.6 percent).
	   Tachriel Sap'ie recently replaced Bambang as the president of
the Bimantara Group.
	   Indonesia, though a petroleum exporting country, imports between
15 percent and 20 percent of its annual fuel consumption of 52
million kiloliters due to the limited capacity of Pertamina's
refineries.
	   Pertamina also imports about 70 million barrels of crude oil,
mainly from the Middle East, to feed its refineries.
	   Soegianto said Perta and Permindo received a commission of 10
U.S. cents per barrel from Pertamina alone.
	   Pertamina is planning to form a trading division to import fuel
and crude oil itself.
	   Perta and Permindo also reportedly enjoys the exclusive rights
to export Pertamina's crude oil to all destinations, except for
Japan, which is the largest importing country for Indonesian crude
oil.
	   The crude oil export to Japan is handled by Pacific Petroleum
Marketing Ltd., which is equally owned by Pertamina and a Japanese
business group that buys the crude oil. (jsk)

IN conjunction with World No Tobacco Day, Kelab Asma Kanak-Kanak

<TEXT>
of Selangor and Federal Territory held interesting activities for
children and their parents at Kidsport in Bangsar Shopping Complex
recently.
	   The day kicked off with a drawing competition in which some 30
children took part.
	   According to Kelab Asma Kanak-kanak president Roslizawati Mohd
Ali, there were more entries but they had limit the number of
participants due to space and manpower contraints. Apart form that
there was an insightful session with Malaysian Medical Association
Public Health chairman Dr Leepak Rampal.
	   A leading physician on smoking and asthma, he spoke on smoking
and its harmful effects, especially on asthmatic children.
	   Later, speaking to a group of concerned parents, Dr Rampal said
smokers were often victims of peer pressure in schools and as such
every effort should be made by the relevant authorities to nip the
problem in the bud.
	   ``It will be a timely move to start clubs in schools to work on
anti-smoking campaigns. Teenagers will respond better if the advice
to keep away or quit smoking comes from their friends instead of an
adult,'' Dr Rampal said.
	   He added that in the 80s, most smokers claimed to have had their
first cigarette in either Form Three of Form Four, but nowadays
most seem to have started in Standard Six. This, he said, was a
worrying trend.
	   Kelab Asma Kanak-Kanak was launched in June last year.
	   The club is an asthma support group for parents, families and
caretakers of asthmatic children.
	   Those wishing to join the club can contact the Medical Societies
Secretariat at 03-7576641.

JAKARTA (JP): State Minister for the Empowerment of State

<TEXT>
Enterprises Tanri Abeng said yesterday that the government had yet
to sell PT Krakatau Steel to a foreign investor, following
opposition from the company's management over an agreement made
with the Netherlands-based Ispat International.
	   Speaking to journalists before a limited cabinet meeting here
yesterday, Tanri confirmed that the government had signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the transfer of 49 percent of
the state-owned steel producer's shares to Ispat International.
	   ``This is a business strategic game, but we have not yet reached
the final stage. This is only the beginning... This is a game to
attract domestic and international interest in Krakatau Steel.
	   ``We will give the same opportunity to other parties to conduct
similar studies, and we will have an open tender... There must be a
fair game.''
	   Tanri stressed that four stages should occur before a state
company was privatized: an open tender, a technical evaluation, an
economic evaluation and a recommendation from his office.
	   He said the government had yet to open a tender for Krakatau
Steel, and that Ispat had come as an unsolicited investor.
	   ``We have to give it a chance. But we have not undergone the
stages of negotiation, tender and technical evaluation. So we are
still in a very early stage,'' he said.
	   Tanri made the statement in response to accusations from
Krakatau Steel's management that the deal with Ispat was
``mysterious'' since the management was not consulted.
	   Krakatau Steel's acting president, Djoko Subagyo, said Tuesday
that he and other members of the company's board of directors and
commissioners never received reports on the deal, not even a copy
of the MOU.
	   The company's former president, Soetoro Mangoensoewargo, who
resigned from his job Monday, questioned the legitimacy of the
Ispat deal, saying the MOU violated earlier strategic agreements on
Krakatau Steel's privatization.
	   According to the MOU, signed May 7 by Tanri and Ispat chief
executive officer Lakshmi N. Mittal, the government has agreed to
sell 49 percent of Krakatau Steel's shares but will allow Ispat to
buy up to 51 percent if the offer is attractive.
	   The sale of 49 percent of Krakatau Steel would be worth about
US$400 million, assuming the company's total assets are worth $800
million.
	   Krakatau Steel said yesterday that its assets were valued at Rp
6 trillion (US$545 million at the current rate) according to an
audit performed last year. It claimed its assets currently total
about $2 billion.
	   The MOU also states that Ispat is to complete all due diligence
by June 21 and that the binding and sales purchases agreement is to
be executed by June 30.
	   It says Krakatau is not to disclose any nonpublic information
concerning the deal to a third party without Ispat's written
consent until July 7.
	   Soetoro said that if Ispat controlled 49 percent of Krakatau's
shares, it would hold a monopoly in the domestic steel wire and rod
market since the company fully owned local subsidiary PT Ispat-Indo
in Surabaya.
	   Ispat-Indo is currently the largest domestic maker of wire and
rods, producing 450,000 metric tons annually.
	   If Ispat took control of Krakatau Steel, which now produces
300,000 tons of wire and rods a year, the combined production would
account for 80 percent of domestic capacity.
	   Tanri, however, noted that Krakatau Steel had long been regarded
as the most difficult state-owned company to sell.
	   ``Why is Krakatau Steel difficult to sell? Because it has often
been said that the company would go bankrupt and that it needed an
investment of $1.2 billion,'' he said.
	   He added that a number of foreign investors invited to be
Krakatau's strategic partners, like BHP of Australia and British
Steel, had not been interested.
	   He said that to date, the company's management had not found a
partner.
	   ``That is why we began with such a business strategy to start
attracting investors. The company has yet to be sold,'' he
reiterated.
	   Asked why the company's management was not involved in the
process that led to the signing of the MOU, he said they would be
invited to participate in the recommendation stage.
	   The newly formed Independent Committee for Integrated Economic
Reform called yesterday for the cancellation of the Krakatau Steel
purchase deal.
	   Committee spokesman Deddy Julianto said the sale would form a
new monopoly in the domestic wire and rod market.
	   Members of the committee, formed two months ago, met yesterday
with Krakatau's top executives to question the transparency of the
MOU deal. (prb/das/rid)

JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia booked a surplus of US$1.97 billion in

<TEXT>
its foreign trade in March, partly due to a sharp drop in imports,
Minister of Trade and Industry Rahardi Ramelan said yesterday.
	   The minister said total exports rose 6 percent to $4.33 billion
in March over the same month last year.
	   But the country, he said, still booked a surplus in its foreign
trade despite the small increase in exports.
	   Imports, including non-oil and gas commodities, dropped 35.18
percent to $2.37 billion over the same period last year.
	   The minister said that in the 1997/1998 fiscal year, which ended
in March, Indonesia recorded a 115.61 percent increase in its trade
surplus to $15.10 billion
	   ``It looks good, but there is also a report on (non-oil and gas)
exports to our major destination countries. Non-oil exports to the
U.S., for the first two months of this year, grew only 3.22
percent, to Japan they dropped 22.19 percent, to the Netherlands
18.62 percent, toGermany 7.1 percent, to South Korea 28.75 percent
and to England 11.65 percent,'' Rahardi said after attending a
3.5-hour monthly cabinet meeting on the economy, finance and
industry at the Bina Graha presidential office.
	   Rahardi held a joint press conference after the meeting with
Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah, Minister of Cooperatives and
Small Enterprises Adi Sasono, Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto
and Minister of Agriculture Soleh Solahuddin.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics disclosed Monday that Indonesia
booked a trade surplus of $5.09 billion during the first quarter of
this year, with exports reaching $12.29 billion and imports $7.2
billion.
	   The bureau said the country's month-to-month inflation rate rose
5.24 percent in May, bringing the total increase in the consumer
price index to 40.06 percent for the first five months of 1998.
	   Rahardi said the government plans to import 3.1 million tons of
rice this year as the State Logistics Agency (Bulog) had said that
its domestic rice procurement this year would not likely exceed
250,000 tons of rice.
	   In encouraging farmers to boost their productivity the
government has also raised the floor price of unhusked rice to Rp
1,000 per kg, compared to the previous price of Rp 700, he noted.
	   ``In a bid to save our foreign exchange reserves, we will
maximally use international food assistance in the importation of
rice,'' Rahardi said.
	   The government also has to import at least 1.3 million of sugar
this year because its domestic production will be only about 1.8
million tons.
	   ``Our sugar need in 1998 is about 3.1 million tons,'' Rahardi
noted.
	   The government will also have to bring in 500,000 tons of corn
because its production is expected to be only 9.4 million tons.
	   Rahardi said he was confident that the cooking oil price would
stabilize soon as the government will continue distributing
adequate supplies to local markets.
	   ``The selling price is expected to be about Rp 4,000 per kg,''
he noted. (prb)

JAKARTA (JP): State Logistics Agency (Bulog) said it has

<TEXT>
reversed a 1996 land swap deal with PT Goro Batara Sakti, a private
wholesale company which until recently was owned by former
president Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra.
	   Bulog chairman Beddu Amang said on Tuesday that the deal had
been reversed because of the change in Goro's ownership. Under the
deal, Goro swapped a 75 hectare site in Merunda near Tanjung Priok
port for a 50 hectare site owned by the agency near the expensive
residential area of Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta.
	   ``The deal has been reversed because PT Humpuss sold Goro to
Inkud (the Confederation of Indonesian Primary Cooperatives'
Associations),'' Beddu told House of Representatives Commission III
for agriculture, forestry and plantations, transmigration and food
affairs on Tuesday.
	   PT Humpuss, controlled by Hutomo, owned the wholesale chain
through PT Goro Batara Sakti and PT Goro Yudhistira Utama.
	   Goro has two sales outlets, one in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta,
and a second in Kelapa Gading. The Goro wholesale outlet in Kelapa
Gading stands on the plot of land at the center of the controversy.
	   In October 1996 Goro swapped its 75 hectare Marunda site for the
50 hectare plot in Kelapa Gading where it operated a 270,000 ton
capacity warehouse.
	   Under the deal, Goro was required to build a 450,000 ton
warehouse on the Marunda site. It failed to meet this obligation,
but nevertheless went on to construct a sales outlet over eight
hectares of the Kelapa Gading site.
	   Beddu said that Inkud, Goro's new owner, had asked the agency to
grant it the sales outlet site in Kelapa Gading, but this plea had
been rebuffed because the land belonged to the state.
	   Inkud then offered an unspecified part of its stake in Goro to
Bulog, he added.
	   ``But we refused the offer because accepting it would have got
us into trouble,'' he said.
	   Beddu said that the agency had offered to lease four hectares of
the disputed land to Goro, and take the remaining four hectares
back under its control.
	   ``We are still waiting for an answer from Inkud,'' he said.
	   Until recently, PT Goro Batara Sakti had a 55 percent
controlling stake in Goro, which was established in 1995. The
remaining 45 percent was owned by PT Goro Yudhistira Utama.
	   PT Humpuss formerly owned 80 percent in PT Goro Batara, which
held a 75 percent stake in PT Goro Yudhistiro. The remaining 20
percent stake in PT Goro Batara was owned by businessman Ricardo
Gelael.
	   Inkud, which before the sale of Goro shares owned a 25 percent
stake in Goro Yudhistiro, now controls 100 percent of the wholesale
company. (gis)

Yeltsin vetoes restrictive land code
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ As promised, President Boris Yeltsin vetoed a
proposed land code Thursday that would have prohibited most private
real estate deals, a news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has campaigned for giving Russians the right to buy and
sell land, but Communists and other hard-liners in Parliament are
adamantly opposed to liberalizing the country's land laws.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, Yeltsin wrote letters to
parliamentary leaders saying the bill they sent him failed to take
his views into consideration.
	   A two-thirds majority is required in both houses of parliament
to override the president's veto.
	   The issue of owning land in Russia remains highly controversial.
Since the Soviet breakup, citizens have been permitted to own land
in urban areas, but most agricultural plots remain state property
and are farmed collectively as in Soviet times.
	   The bill sent to Yeltsin prohibits most forms of land deals,
including inheritance, grants and other forms of transferring
ownership.

JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia's economy may not survive for more than

<TEXT>
three months unless the country elects a new credible government,
according to an independent think tank.
	   Plunging foreign exchange reserves, the ballooning budget
deficit and the severe lack of capital inflow are all serious
threats to the economy's ability to survive the economic crisis,
the Econit Advisory Group said yesterday in a discussion.
	   ``We must have a government which is credible both domestically
and internationally,'' said the group's senior economist Rizal
Ramli.
	   He explained that President B.J. Habibie, and his economic
ministerial team were not a solution but still part of the problem
because they had served during the Soeharto era.
	   ``It is therefore difficult to expect them to change their
conventional ways of thinking in dealing with the economic
crisis,'' Rizal noted.
	   Former president Soeharto ended his 32-year rule last month
after pressure from the House of Representatives, students and most
mass organizations. He handed over the reins of power to his
protege Habibie, at the time the vice president.
	   However, Habibie himself is still facing strong pressure to
quickly arrange a general election based on a new political system
to elect a credible leader who is trusted by the people.
	   Econit dubbed the current government as ``a new brand of old
stock.''
	   Rizal explained that because the solution to the current
economic crisis depended largely on a solution to the political
uncertainty, a credible government must be elected quickly.
	   ``Time is running against us because of the economic
paralysis,'' said Arif Arryman, another Econit economist.
	   Habibie, who has promised a general election sometime next year
and presidential elections before the end of next year, seems to
have started gaining international confidence.
	   The World Bank said yesterday that it had resumed a US$225
million loan to reduce poverty in Indonesia.
	   IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss has also said that
Habibie had shown positive steps toward the implementation of human
rights, and that the country had an impressive economic team led by
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita.
	   The IMF is expected to soon disburse another $1 billion in
bailout money to Indonesia.
	   Indonesia is currently being administered to by the IMF through
its multibillion dollar sweeping economic reform programs designed
to lift the economy from its worst crisis in three decades.
	   Econit, however, said that unless the country had a legitimate
and credible government the economy would soon collapse.
	   It cited several indicators.
	   Despite the punitively high interest rates, the rupiah has
failed to stabilize against the U.S. dollar.
	   The local currency plunged to its lowest level of Rp 17,000 to
the dollar in January, against Rp 2,450 in July before the crisis.
The currency was hovering at around Rp 12,000 yesterday.
	   Rizal said the sharp depreciation of the rupiah had failed to
boost exports as businesses had been hurt by the high interest
rates and the international community's refusal to accept letters
of credit from most Indonesian banks.
	   ``This is a very sad situation because exports are the best and
most effective way out of the crisis,'' he said.
	   He also said that the country's alarmingly low level of foreign
reserves, of only around $14.5 billion compared to the short-term
overseas debt obligation of $14.2 billion and import needs of $4
billion per month, was exacerbated by the virtual halt of capital
inflow.
	   The economic hardships are being worsened by the high inflation
rate which Econit estimates will reach more than 80 percent this
year due to the severe shortage of essential food items.
	   Econit expects the economy to contract 10 percent this year
against an average growth rate of 7 percent before the crisis.
	   ``This would cause additional unemployment of around 20
million,'' Rizal said
	   Arif said that even with the rupiah standing at Rp 8,000, the
government would not be able to finance its budget.
	   He pointed out that with that exchange rate and the price of oil
at $14 per barrel, government revenue would only be Rp 114 trillion
compared to expenditure of Rp 125 trillion, excluding subsidies on
essential foods.
	   ``Actually, with an exchange rate of above Rp 6,000, we're
already bankrupt,'' he said, adding that the government may soon
run out of money even to pay its personnel and the military.
	   Given the limited foreign exchange reserves and exploding budget
deficit, the government's blanket guarantee on the claims on banks,
massive liquidity injection to problem banks and subsidies on
staple goods and medicines are only hastening the government's
descent into bankruptcy, Arif explained.
	   ``The personal credibility of the country's leader is key to the
recovery,'' Rizal said, pointing out that other crisis-hit
countries, Thailand and South Korea, were able to recover because
of their new, credible, governments. (rei)

JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed Bank Papan Sejahtera (BPS) said

<TEXT>
yesterday that it received liquidity credits of Rp 990.36 billion
(US$90 million) from Bank Indonesia last year, or about 45 percent
of the company's total assets of Rp 2.2 trillion in the same
period.
	   One of the bank's commissioners, Al Njoo, said yesterday that
Bank Papan had promised Bank Indonesia to pay the credits this
year.
	   ``The first installment will be paid at the end of June and the
second at the end of December 1998,'' told the media after a
shareholders meeting here yesterday, which among other things
approved his appointment to commissioner from his previous job as
president.
	   He was replaced by JRM Winarendra.
	   Njoo, however, did not disclose the outstanding credits provided
by the central bank as of this month or how much of the loan Bank
Papan had repaid.
	   Bank Papan, controlled by Hashim Djojohadikusumo's Tirtamas
Group, is among 32 private commercial and provincial development
banks currently under the supervision of theIndonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) due to their worsening financial
performance.
	   These banks, according to IBRA, have obtained liquidity credits
from the central bank equivalent to more than 200 percent of their
capital and have a capital adequacy ratio of less than 5 percent.
	   Al Njoo also declined to mention the financial sources from
which the money would come to pay the central bank's credits but
said that it was currently seeking to merge with several local
private banks to boost its capital.
	   He said that talks on a merger were still underway and are
expected to be concluded within two months.
	   ``It is too early for us to mention the names of the other
banks,'' he said.
	   He said that if the bank signed an agreement to merge, it would
also seek approval from IBRA, which is currently supervising it, as
well as from the Ministry of Finance.
	   But he said that merging with other private banks was the most
feasible solution for Bank Papan to boost its capital and to face
the tight competition in the banking industry in the years ahead.
	   He said the country would need around 20 strong banks with total
assets ranging between Rp 20 trillion and Rp 30 trillion to survive
the future cut-throat competition.
	   ``That is why Bank Papan will have to merge with other banks,''
he said.
	   He said the bank's previous plan to merge with Bank Kredit Asia
and Bank Pelita had been dropped as they had both been suspended by
Bank Indonesia.
	   Bank Papan, which had total assets worth Rp 2.02 trillion last
year, recorded a net loss of Rp 40.41 billion in 1997. The bank
booked a net profit of Rp 8.76 billion the previous year. (aly)

Government offers 10 percent of its share in Tanzania Breweries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The government is making a second
public offering of its minority stake in Tanzania Breweries Ltd.
for public sale, a brewery official said Thursday.
	   Chief executive officer Dimat Niemandt said the sale 10 percent
more of the government's current 36.9 percent holding will be
confined to citizens and institutions registered in Tanzania.
	   Application must be for a minimum of 50 shares, and thereafter
in multiplies of 10.
	   The sale closes June 26.
	   The government will retain 26.9 percent of its current stake,
Niemandt said.
	   Other major shareholders in TBL are South African Breweries
International (Africa) with 50.5 percent and the International
Corp. with 8.8 percent.
	   Niemandt said TBL is investing in production and distribution in
order to meet anticipated demand, which he said was expected to
double by next year.
	   The first public offer was floated on May 18.

LATELY, lists of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) companies

<TEXT>
likely to go belly-up have been causing jitters among investors.
But notably, companies commonly perceived as safe-havens during
troubled times, have not turned up on these lists. Bluechip Nestle
Malaysia Bhd seems to belong to this safe, staid subset. During
bullruns, it's castigated as safe and boring, sans the triple digit
price run-ups. And during recessionary weather, it is predictably
safe from bankruptcy and volatile economic conditions.
	   Judging from history, this Swiss-based multinational is hardly
likely to go bankrupt. Nestle Malaysia has long been exposed to
adversity. Thirty-three of its 85 years in Malaysia have been spent
on both trading and manufacturing. During its time here, the
multinational has waded through economic vagaries and political
squalls, even the ineffable days of 1957's independence. This track
record allows Nestle Malaysia the luxury of viewing the current
economic slowdown as a small blip on the horizon, a small blip in
the life of a nation or company'. Elaborates Ajit Saran, Nestle
Malaysia's managing director, `It's not something that pulls us off
track.' On the other hand, this `small blip' could very well drag
Nestle Malaysia's bottomline downwards. With the downturn, the
costs of raw materials have ballooned. Sugar recorded the lowest
price increase of 23 per cent, against a June/July 1997 benchmark.
Malaysian palm oil costs 70 per cent more, local cocoa 80 per cent
more, while Perstima tinplate doubled by 50 per cent. Other
locally-sourced materials rose between 70 and 90 per cent, with
lower increases in utilities, transportation and containerisation.
	   This burden of rising costs cannot be offset simply by passing
on the costs to the consumer. `Food and beverage,' explains Saran,
`deal with the average consumer. Our success depends on the
acceptance of the average Malaysian family. So, we've taken price
increases in very small bites of between five and six per cent at a
time.' Price increases, claims Saran, are a last resort when
dealing with cost increases. For example, Maggi instant noodles
have held steady at 45 sen for a long time with small three per
cent increases per year that add up to a cumulative 18 per cent.
	   The last few months, however, has seen prices rise by more than
10 per cent. To hold price increases at bay, Nestle Malaysia
implemented a stringent austerity programme on New Year's Day,
1998. `What we don't need, we don't spend on. What we can defer
without impacting on the quality, integrity or safety of our
products, we will. We're hoping we can make as many internal
savings as possible,' says Saran.
	   But the internal savings will not involve the
slashing-and-burning of the Nestle Malaysia workforce. At present,
`We have not shut production lines. We have not fired even one
worker.' In fact, Nestle Malaysia is apparently always 60 to 70
people short. Yearly staff turnover is a mere seven per cent
compared with the industry's 25 per cent average. Saran claims
there will be no lay-offs, in line with the rare and rarefied
policy (in Malaysia, at least) that Nestle Malaysia owes its
loyalty - in good times and bad - to three parties: shareholders,
employees and customers. Customers are rewarded with minimal price
increases, while employees enjoy job security, a valued commodity
today.
	   Shareholders, theoretically, should reap sizeable capital gains
and dividends. The former is unlikely in today's bear market,
unless the investor is willing to wait for two or three years for
the equity market to recover. Dividends, promises Saran, will still
be forthcoming but the quantum may vary from previous years. Nestle
Malaysia, claims Saran, pays high dividends 'since we have a
responsibility to shareholders'.
	   For 1997, interim dividends were 20 per cent and final dividends
were 122.4 per cent, remarkable in a country where shares are not
an income-generating instrument. At the same time, he is pragmatic
about the amount of Nestle Malaysia dividends in the near future.
`The bottomline will suffer for two or three years. That's the cost
of being in business. We have to absorb losses,' says Saran. But
things were still rosy in 1997 with Nestle Malaysia reporting a 7.1
per cent increase in group pre-tax profit for the year ended Dec
30, 1997 to RM253.9 million from RM237.1 million previously. Group
turnover rose 8.9 per cent to RM2.01 billion from RM1.85 billion
before.
	   It doesn't help matters that Nestle Malaysia doesn't have a very
large export base to provide it with forex earnings, and take
advantage of certain stronger foreign currencies. At present, only
10 per cent of its turnover, or about RM170 million, is exported to
about 42 countries. But Saran claims Nestle Malaysia will increase
its exports to RM330 million in future.
	   Why? Two reasons. One: a major factory is coming onstream to
produce confectionery like ice-cream. Because, says Saran, `History
shows that cheap treats or small pleasures still sell in times of
economic difficulties.' Second: it's also targeting the Middle East
and Central Asian markets for halal food exports.
	   Nestle Malaysia has got one big advantage when it comes to
penetrating the global market for halal products, estimated at some
RM80 billion, because it's the only Nestle branch whose products
are fully certified as halal. Says Saran, `We're the group's halal
food supplier.' To facilitate progress, Nestle Malaysia isn't going
to suspend its activities. Investments are still ongoing, with
RM171.5 million budgeted for 1998 compared with 1997's RM143
million. Out of this, RM136 million was production-related. The
breakdown - RM37 million went to replacement of equipment and
rationalisation of lines, another RM25 million for capital
expenditure and RM74 million for new products. Among other things,
Nestle Malaysia is emphasising vending activities.
	   Labour shortages mean that it's theoretically possible to
mechanise the serving of beverages through vending machines. The
company is also moving into health drinks like chilled milk
products - fresh, pasteurised products with initial minimal
processing. The familiar face of Milo has also undergone a sea
change. Now, prepared Milo is sold not only in tetrapaks but also
in cans. The rationale - tetrapaks are used by children whereas
cans are a more sophisticated package. All in all, says Saran,
`We're investing an average of RM150 million per year or about six
to seven per cent of turnover.' Funding for investment comes from
internally-generated funds.
	   Indirectly, this means that there will be no increase in paid-up
capital since Saran says that reserves are not going to be
capitalised for bonus issues.

TAKE a walk around the Perodua plant in Sungei Choh, about 10km

<TEXT>
from Rawang, Selangor. If not for the fact that the signboard
clearly states Perodua, one could be excused for thinking that one
is at a naval yard.
	   Everyone from the top executive downward is dressed in white,
quite like a naval officer's uniform. Even the good-looking
receptionist at the corporate building wears the uniform.
	   In fact, even at company events held outside its premises, the
staff of Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd don the all-white
uniform, led by its managing director Datuk Abdul Rahman Omar.
	   ``Wearing the same uniform makes our employees feel that they
are part of the same team, regardless of their position in the
company. In other words, everybody appears to be equal,'' Abdul
Rahman said in a recent interview.
	   ``But still our employees remember the basic rule that they
cannot go beyond the line. They are well aware that they have to
respect their seniors. Of course, they also know that there are
certain aspects which differentiate them from the senior
executives,'' he said.
	   Abdul Rahman - formerly one of the driving forces at Perusahaan
Sadur Timah Malaysia Bhd - and his senior officers proudly wear the
white uniform on all occasions; interview, product launch and even
formal meeting with the country's policy makers and corporate
leaders, and not just within Perodua's compound.
	   Abdul Rahman's management philosophy is that of a hands-on
operator. He says he prefers to go out rather than just wait for
his senior staff to present their reports.
	   ``I like to go around and get information by myself. For me,
official reporting is too formal...
	   ``I realise that we are dealing with human beings...I'm
interested to personally know whether my staff have the same vision
as me...to know that they are, at least, trying to move towards
that vision.''
	   How much has the company progressed since he took over in 1996?
	   ``The company placed more emphasis on meeting sales targets and
market share rather than putting in place strategically-prepared
programmes to face challenges in years ahead.''
	   That emphasis enabled Perodua, which began operation in 1994, to
sell over 20,000 cars during the first year, said Abdul Rahman, who
was appointed to the company's top post on May 2, 1996 following
the resignation of chief executive officer Datuk Ho Tet Khong.
	   His instant task after he took over was to develop a programme
that would enable Perodua to face the growing competition in the
automotive sector in the country and the region. This gave birth to
a five-year expansion programme which was launched early this year.
	   The programme calls for some RM2.3 billion to be invested till
2003, with the introduction of a new model each year beginning
1998. Equally central to the programme is ``project X2001'' which
focus on the production of a new range of vehicles using the Kancil
platform within three years, and the establishment of more
production lines.
	   Project X2001 is estimated to cost RM250 million and is
progressing well. The company expects to produce vehicles using its
own technology and expertise by the end of 2001.
	   It's reasonable to say that Abdul Rahman has achieved much
success although he is not even half-way through his five-year
contract which should see him through to 2001.
	   Perodua director of operations for sales and marketing,
Zainuddin Bahaudin, one of Abdul Rahman's advisers, said: ``Datuk's
arrival had brought significant changes especially when we are
dealing with our Japanese partner.
	   ``Cooperation is now at the higher level...We have more say in
deciding on where we want to go and various matters regarding
production works including the contents for our vehicles,'' said
Zainuddin, who was also present at the interview.
	   Still, Abdul Rahman is far from satisfied with his achievements.
He feels that more efforts need to be made, especially when it
comes to the company's partnership with Dahaitsu of Japan.
	   ``For us to survive in the future, we need to have at least the
basic foundation in automobile-making because we don't want to be
known as an assembler.
	   ``We want to be recognised as a full-fledged automotive
manufacturer. If Dahaitsu is looking at the current level of
co-operation...I don't think we will be able (to be one)...
	   ``No automotive maker can survive simply on its partners'
technology and expertise,'' he said.
	   It is this desire that has made Perodua, which produces compact
cars and multi-utility vans using Daihatsu's technology, come up
with Project 2001.
	   Under the project, 50 experienced Perodua engineers are being
given extensive exposure in automobile production at an engineering
and design firm in Italy with the ultimate goal of developing a
``Dahaitsu-free'' model by the year 2001.
	   The 50 engineers are being taught various aspects of automobile
production - from designing, styling and completing prototypes
besides undertaking related engineering tasks and assembly.
	   At the end of the three-year project or perhaps earlier, Perodua
expects to unveil a new vehicle which is still based on the Kancil
platform but completely different in shape and interiors.
	   This ``re-looking and re-assessing'' of Perodua's relationship
with the Japanese partner with the aim of having more say in the
decision-making process regarding production is his core interest
at the moment, but Abdul Rahman is also keen to have a bigger say
in making decisions at the management level.
	   This means managing the company without interference from
internal or external parties, and this could be accomplished by
being the controlling shareholder.
	   Asked whether this was possible, Abdul Rahman did not rule out
the possibiliy of acquiring a controlling stake in the company
should the situation arise.
	   In fact, the planned backdoor listing of Perodua on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange late last year seemed to pave the way for him
to attain the vision.
	   But the listing plan was put on hold till the economic and
financial problems improve. (Up to October last year, two companies
had been identified to be a vehicle for the proposed backdoor
listing).
	   Abdul Rahman readily acknowledges that there's much more work
needed to ensure the company's survival in the highly competitive
automotive industry. In his usual calm and composed manner, Abdul
Rahman has a steely determination to give his competitors a run for
their money.
	   An example of his shrewed marketing strategy is the recent
introduction of a new variant of Kancil EX called Kancil EX-extra
and a limited edition EX-B model at more affordable and attractive
prices.
	   With Proton reducing its on-the-road price of the 1.3 Iswara
Aeroback by RM10,000 to RM26,683, Perodua decided to sell the 660cc
manually-operated Kancil EX at RM21,770 (without optional
accessories) to RM25,540 (with optional accessories like
air-conditioner, radio, alarm system, central locking system and
wheelcaps).
	   The 659cc four-speed EX-B model is sold at RM19,980 per unit.
	   Abdul Rahman surely wants to see Perodua entering the next
millennium stronger and more confident.

LESS THAN three weeks after His Majesty King Hussein's

<TEXT>
initiative to open a national dialogue between the different
popular sectors in the country, the government seems again to be
insisting on spoiling the first days of the honeymoon.
	   Contrary to what happened in terms of narrowing the gap between
the state and the professional associations, that brought about a
new era of understanding, the government is criticized once again
for seeking to draw up a new law that is seen by far as the most
repressive yet.
	   Popular sectors, especially members of the press body are
dismayed because the government is drawing up the draft without
proper consultations and certainly not within the spirit of
dialogue that was the case a couple of weeks ago. This is something
that was also underlined when the King met the members of the three
branches of state as he stressed the necessity for participation of
all parties in drawing up legislations.
	   The government insistence on drafting a new press law came five
months after the High Court of Justice revoked a previous temporary
press law which was passed in May 1996.
	   The draft law will be completed today, Thursday by the Legal
Committee at the Prime Ministry.
	   It is due to be presented to the Cabinet for final approval on
Saturday 6 June.
	   Cabinet ratified the first initial draft law last Saturday, when
Deputy Prime Minister for Service Affairs, Minister of Information,
Dr Abdallah Nsour discussed the draft with officials of the Jordan
Press Association (JPA). They in turn opposed many of its articles.
	   ``During our meeting we expressed reservations over many of the
draft articles which lowers the margin of freedoms and gives the
director of the Press and Publication Dept., the right to interfere
in newspapers,'' said JPA President Seif Al Sharif.
	   ``In light of these articles there will be no free press,'' he
continues. ``The draft strengthens penalties on journalists.'' Mr
Sharif said even the 1973 press law, drawn up in the martial law
era, banned putting journalists in prison, adding ``we reject all
articles that talk about penalties and we told the Deputy Prime
Minister to that effect.''
	   The draft press law angered many (see story below). It sparked
much criticism from different sectors in the country. Several Lower
House deputies, leaders of the Professional Associations and
journalists expressed their bitterness regarding the draft. Popular
sectors described it as bringing the country back to the martial
law era.
	   ``The draft law goes against the spirit of openness which His
Majesty King Hussein started with during his visit to the
professional Associations,'' said Husni Abu Ghaida, who leads the
Council of the Professional Associations and is the President of
the Engineers Association.
	   ``The available information concerning the draft law suggests
that the ceiling of press freedom will be limited as the
professional associations are banned from publishing its views
regarding public affairs.''
	   The PAs reject any legislation that suppresses the freedom of
citizens to express themselves freely as guaranteed by the
Constitution. In its emergency meeting on Monday, the Council of
Presidents said it had an ``around the clock'' duty to follow up
news on the draft.
	   Mr Mahmoud Al Sharif a former minister of information and the
architect of the 1993 Press and Publication Law believes that
``there is no need for a new law, unless the government wants to
curtail the space for freedom that is guaranteed by the 1993 press
law.'' He added that it can deal with all abuses of the freedom of
the press.
	   ``If what have been already published in the newspapers about
the draft law is true then it would be very damaging to the image
of Jordan abroad.'' He emphasized that ``it is a tragedy, because
it is Jordan that is going to suffer not the press only,'' said Mr
Sharif, who is also the Editor-In-Chief of Ad Dustour. ``If what
has been published in the newspapers is true we are having a more
repressive law. It is a backward step.''
	   In this respect also, deputies are somewhat dismayed and they
expressed their criticism to the draft law in the form that was
published in the press.
	   ``Despite His Majesty's insistence on the necessity for
discussing the draft law with the concerned parties before
presenting it to Parliament, the government have not discussed it
with the deputies concerned,'' said Nayef Mola who heads the Lower
House National Guidance Committee which will examine the draft law
before presenting it to the Lower House.
	   Despite his refusal to comment on press reports regarding the
articles of the draft, he criticized what he termed as the secret
methods in which the government dealt with an important issue like
the draft law, said Mola, a former head of the Press and
Publication Dept.
	   And Lower House deputy Abdel Karim Al Doghmi, a former minister
of justice believes that there is no need for a new press law since
the current law [of 1993] is balanced, modern and satisfies all the
professional and democratic needs.
	   Political parties and human rights organizations also voiced
deep concern on the democratic process if the published draft law
become a status quo and not ratified by the Parliament.

PERSONAL computers provide many benefits to business

<TEXT>
productivity, but improper use can cause user strain, major
discomfort and even short- or long-term disability. Here's what
managers should know about protecting staff by identifying and
avoiding computer-related repetitive stress injury (RSI) and
associated productivity loss.
	   While today's latest computer systems deliver the performance
necessary for voice recognition and other emerging computer input
technologies, the majority of users are faced with conventional
keyboard and mouse. At one time or another, nearly all of us have
experienced stiff necks, sore backs, or cramped hands from
excessive use of computers. Frequent or consistent symptoms like
these often lead to RSI, though computer use is not the only source
of it.
	   Musicians, dressmakers, artists, butchers, carpenters and
practitioners of many other occupations can face these types of
injuries. However, studies have shown that the incidence of
computer-related RSI is rapidly increasing, especially among
business users, as more and more business processes go on-line.
	   RSI INDICATORS Look at your computer-using staff while they are
working. A simple visual scan can often provide much information
about the potential for RSI in your office environment. Look for
the following attributes among staff while using office computers:
Hunched backs or slouching; Drooping shoulders; Dangling elbows;
Craned necks; Ill-positioned keyboards and monitors; or Cramped,
confined or messy workstations.
	   These signs, combined with long hours of continuous work at the
computer, regularly lead to RSI symptoms.
	   Other indicators of computer-related RSI are often associated
with specific applications or tasks. For example, secretaries
responsible for high volumes of computer-based correspondence or
reports and clerks responsible for data input are more susceptible
to RSI. What's more, emergence of the World Wide Web, e-mail and a
trend toward individuals managing correspondence and report
generation are spreading the risk of RSI to all office computer
users.
	   Immediate steps can be taken to reduce office RSI, such as
remedying obvious hazards and resolving situations where
individuals are uncomfortable when using computers. However, in
order to avoid unnecessary pain, discomfort and productivity loss,
managers should consider a more meaningful and longer-term solution
toward identifying, eliminating and avoiding computer-related RSI.
	   RSI AUDIT A good place to begin managing RSI is to investigate
company policy and previous action taken. If policy or action has
not been established, the next step is to perform an RSI audit.
Check with human resources departments, operations managers, or
other functional managers to find out if any studies have taken
place to date. If not, many options apply for implementing an RSI
audit, depending on your organisation's size and communications
structure.
	   In small organisations, managers can take on the task of
collecting pertinent data directly, and evaluating individual
situations first-hand.
	   Larger organisations should mobilise departmental or workgroup
managers, human resources or a task force to collect and collate
data. Either way, the goal will be to obtain an honest assessment
of the following information from your organisation's individual
computer users: How many hours per week do you use a computer for
company-related activities?
	   How many hours per week do you use a computer for non-company
related activities?
	   What are your primary applications when using a computer?
	   Have you ever experienced sore hands, limbs, back or neck when
using computers? If so, how often? How has this affected your job?
	   Do you feel that the positioning of your computer contributes to
this?
	   If so, how?
	   Additional questions can be included to better match
circumstances in specific functional roles, departments, or other
appropriate divisions.
	   When the RSI audit information is collected, the first step is
identifying and addressing cases where RSI is present. Address each
individual's needs through appropriate medical treatment as well as
changing environmental or work conditions, which I will discuss
later. Next, review the data to identify meaningful trends. Is RSI
widespread or localised among roles or departments? What are other
commonalities among those afflicted by RSI, whether functional,
environmental or even personal, with regard to traits and work
habits?
	   Once you have reviewed the RSI audit data, look for meaningful
ways to share this information with others within your
organisation. Review of this material will often provide real
insights on your organisation's use of computers, and potentially
offer opportunities to refine aspects of your business processes.
	   Finally, use the information that you have collected to enact
workable policies to protect computer users and avoid productivity
loss due to RSI.
	   STEPS TOWARD REDUCING OR ELIMINATING RSI Chances are that after
an RSI audit or even a cursory review of computer use, you will
uncover specific instances of computer-related RSI. Here are some
effective measures that managers can take to reduce or eliminate
computer-related RSI.
	   Environmental conditions or ergonomics play a role in many RSI
cases.
	   Often, RSI can be linked to placement of computer keyboards,
mice and monitors.
	   Start by setting up computer workstations to allow natural
placement of hands on keyboards and mice. Keyboard positioning is
especially important toward reducing stress on wrists, shoulders
and arms. A variety of enhancements are available to improve
keyboard comfort, including adjustable keyboard trays, wrist
supports and ergonomically-designed keyboards.
	   Computer displays can also play a significant role in RSI,
especially in the back, neck and shoulders. Today's larger monitors
of 17-inches and bigger, which have dramatically come down in price
over the past 18 months, typically ease viewing problems and reduce
strain. Other enhancements include placing the monitor in direct
line of sight in front of the user and fine-tuning the height to
the user's preference. A variety of alternatives is available to
help with comfortable monitor placement, including computer
workstations and fixed or adjustable monitor stands.
	   PROCESS REFINEMENT How people do their job often has an impact
on RSI. Job stress is often a contributing factor to most RSI
occurrences. Managers can often play a role in refining processes
or roles to reduce job-related stress.
	   In terms of process enhancement, the most progressive action a
manager can take with regards to reducing RSI is to organise
process timelines to avoid tight deadlines. Stress-related RSI
strikes most often when users need to work late into the night or
over several consecutive days at the computer. Clearly, business
demands often require staff to provide extra effort, but advance
planning or effective load sharing can help mute the impact of
computer-related RSI.
	   NEW TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TODAY In previous articles, I mentioned
the availability of computer-based voice recognition as an
alternative to keyboard-and-mouse input. Yes, I'm talking about
talking to computers. In fact, many computer pundits anticipate
that within 10 years, computers will eliminate conventional
keyboards altogether, replacing them with voice commands and
dictation capability.
	   From my position at Gateway, I have witnessed the advances that
today's powerful computers can offer users, and indeed, talking to
computers has become a reality. Starting with a computer system
such as Gateway's E4200 400 business system, offering Intel's
fastest Pentium II processor (400 MHz), 19-inch monitor and
ergonomic keyboard for under RM10,200 (price at the time of
writing), businesses can choose from a number of highly attractive
software solutions that deliver strong voice recognition features
and performance.
	   Ranging from RM1,500 to RM2,600, voice recognition products from
Dragon Systems and IBM provide a means of significantly reducing
the amount of keyboard input. Dragon's DragonDictate and IBM's
VoiceType products allow voice input on a large vocabulary of
words, allowing users to speak normally into the microphone of a
computer headset to dictate and control computer functions. These
products are strong examples of what is possible today for voice
dictation, and development is underway on next generation products
that can provide even better performance and utility.
	   The most important part of managing RSI is to begin now in
determining the impact on your organisation's health and
productivity, then making appropriate changes to ease or eliminate
the influence of computer-related RSI.
	   I look forward to answering any questions you have regarding
managing computer-related RSI or other topics that I've covered in
this column.
	   Next time, I will be focusing on privacy in the workplace and
how this applies to business data and employee e-mail.
	   The writer is managing director of Gateway 2000 (South Asia).
This is the third in a series of articles on managing IT. Views
expressed are the writer's own.

DECLINING domestic sales has prompted Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua

<TEXT>
Sdn Bhd to increase its export volume to ensure its survival in the
highly competitive automotive industry.
	   Although the export markets currently make up less than five per
cent or a mere 853 units of the company's total sales of 68,731
units last year, Perodua has stepped up efforts to raise the volume
to 2,495 units this year.
	   One of the measures is exploring new markets, and the second
national car manufacturer is looking at including Jordan and the
former Yugoslavia into its export portfolio this year.
	   The company has exported to 11 countries: Brunei, Malta,
Mauritius, Cyprus, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Comoros Island,
Egypt, the UK and Lebanon.
	   It made inroads into the foreign markets after slightly a year
of its inception in August 1994, Brunei being the first.
	   Since 1996 till end of last month, the company had exported a
total of 1,765 Kancil cars and 101 Rusa multi-utility vans to 11
countries.
	   Last year alone, Perodua exported 812 Kancil cars and 41 Rusa
vans. From the beginning of this year until the third week of last
month, export sales totalled 770 units including 36 Rusa vans.
	   Perodua's export strategies are generally simple: Go to the
under-developed markets and where possible, utilise the vehicle
assembly operations in those countries.
	   This means working together with local parties in the respective
country with the intention of operating assembly operations
jointly, and eventually manufacturing the vehicles.
	   Perodua is now contemplating setting up assembly operations in
Egypt with Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd and a local party after
receiving encouraging response for its vehicles in the country and
its other Middle East market, Lebanon.
	   Perodua began exporting the Kancil to Egypt last February and
the first consignment of 80 Kancils was snapped up in the first
week of its arrival.
	   The second consignment of 120 units arrived last month and
another 140 units are due to be shipped at the end of the year.
	   It is reported that Perodua, Proton and its Egyptian partner had
initially looked into the feasibility of immediately manufacturing
the Kancil in Egypt but it was found to be more commercially viable
to first assemble the car instead.

  Eds: Food reaches some villages after five days; others still wait,
  By JUDITH INGRAM  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Some survivors in remote mountainous
northern Afghanistan received their first food Thursday since a
devastating earthquake last weekend killed an estimated 5,000
people, shattered villages, buried wells and swept away crops.
	   The U.S. government donated two Russian MI26 helicopter with a
capacity of 20 tons each to bring emergency foodstuffs from central
Asia. They were expected to join the aid operation in Afghanistan
in two or three days, said U.N. spokesman Rupert Colville.
	   Saturday's earthquake was five times worse than the one that
struck the same area in February, aid officials said.
	   The international aid effort crept along, stalled by the refusal
of airport authorities in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to clear customs
for 4,000 barrels of helicopter fuel. Because of the fuel shortage,
the helicopters flying out of the provincial capital of Faisabad
made only a few trips Thursday to deliver flour and oil.
	   ``That means a lot more people will go hungry tonight who didn't
have to,'' said Colville.
	   The fuel arrived at the end of the day, and aid officials were
set to at least double the number of relief flights each day.
	   In Kura-i-Pain, a village 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of
Faisabad, a cluster of village elders met a U.N. helicopter that
touched down on a ridge. As the men unloaded the food and lifted
flour sacks and oil canisters onto their shoulders, elder Abdul
Aziz began to weep.
	   ``We have been waiting for the plane to bring some food,'' he
said, his voice trembling. ``Our children are really starving.''
	   The 50-family village lost 10 people in the earthquake, with 15
others injured and six still missing. Fifty of their animals also
died.
	   In Delgi, where 22 people died and 30 were injured, villagers
screamed at the U.N. workers that they needed food, tents and
water. The food package will be enough for only three to four days,
said Mohamed Asadullah, a U.N. food coordinator on the flight.
	   The helicopter couldn't land in a third village, Bari-i-Kham,
because of huge cracks the quake had opened in the side of the
mountain. As village men crouched below the whirring blades, the
helicopter hovered a meter (3 feet) off the ground and U.N. workers
tossed the aid packages out the door.
	   The United Nations was negotiating with Russia's Emergency
Situations Ministry to lease several more helicopters.
	   Aid officials say several thousand tons of food were needed to
feed people in some 100 damaged villages for the next month, until
the summer harvest.
	   In Rustaq, the region badly hit by both quakes this year, aid
workers set up village bakeries to turn flour donated by the World
Food Program into bread.
	   Israel and the Netherlands announced they would donate emergency
shelters, while the Islamic Cooperation Council donated dlrs
250,000.
	   A donor conference was planned for Islamabad in neighboring
Pakistan on Friday.

AMMAN (Star)-The press body was shocked to learn about the new

<TEXT>
draft press lawwhich has emerged from the Fifth Circle. The draft
law is still under consideration bythe and final approval by the
government is expected Saturday.
	   Despite the government promises to take into consideration some
of the demands ofthe Jordan Press Association, informed sources
told The Star that the governmentignored all suggestions made by
the JPA.
	   The articles that emerged so far from the draft law are sending
shivers amongjournalists, who say that if true, the draft will be a
major blow to press freedoms. Theinitial draft, which will replace
the current law of 1993, is now going throughgovernment channels.
Despite the ``secret'' manner that surrounds the drawing up of
thelaw, certain articles have been published in the mainstream
dailies.
	   The draft law is seen as one of the most repressive, being
described. Its verycontentious articles, if adopted in their
present state, promise to put a lid on freedom ofexpression.
	   One of the articles for instance prohibits the publication of
political views and activitiesof Professional Associations and
charitable organizations; one may only report on the''profession''
itself and its activities however.
	   Mr Seif Al Sharif had the chance to see the initial draft law
during a meeting withDeputy Prime Minister, Abdallah Nsour, and was
given the opportunity to express hisconcerns on many of the
articles. He added that one article gave new powers to thedirector
of the Press and Publication Department (PPD) to close down any
newspaperwith in 24 hours, whenever a violation of the law took
place. ``Only the judiciary has theright to decide whether this
paper committed a violation or not,'' Mr Sharif said.
	   In addition, newspapers could be closed after three violations.
On each violation, theycan also be temporarily closed until the
court gives its verdict.
	   Mr Sharif added that the we agreed on some articles and rejected
many others, and hepointed out that the government promised to
cancel an article giving the director of thePPD the authority to
ask for assistance from the police to raid newspapers.
	   A new requirement is a bank deposit from each paper, (JD 100,000
for dailies and JD50,000 for weeklies) against violations. So each
time courts convict them, the penaltywould be deducted immediately
from their bank accounts.
	   However, the government promises the JPA to decrease the capital
requirement for theweeklies from JD 300,000 to 150,000, whilst the
dailies it is up to JD 500,000. Theseare paid and not registered
capital.
	   Violations may also be tried under different laws, not
necessarily press and publicationlaw, but under the Penal Code and
by the State Security Court.
	   Another article states that if the chief editor is absent from
his office for two months orgoes abroad for the same period of
time, he could be disqualified by the Press andPublication Dept,
unless he explains himself to the PPD Director. All decisions are
atthe discretion of the Director.
	   Also, the Chief Editor must have a minimum of 10 years
experience and be a memberof Press Association. Their will be no
distinction between ``Responsible Chief Editor''and ``Chief
Editor'' as there is at present.The draft also canceled the article
in the current law that requires the government to sellits
financial shares in the two mainstream dailies, currently standing
at 62 percent and32 percent in Al Rai and Ad Dustour respectively.
The draft also gives the governmentthe opportunity to establish its
own newspapers, something which is banned under thecurrent law.
	   In a clear violation to the authority of the JPA, the draft law
also allows editors workingin the official media like the Jordan
television and radio, to become members of theassociation. In
addition, non members of the JPA will be prohibited from working
ascorrespondents with foreign media and press.
	   MPs, professional association members and the press body are
angry, and say that ifadopted it would mean an end to the
profession as we know it.
	   Many top journalists are saying that it would be much better to
stick to 1993 PressLaw. The Government have being saying that it
wants to introduce a draft law thatwould be modern and in line with
the times, but these proposals seem to be going in theopposite
direction.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ New York State banking authorities
Thursday approved the merger of two of Switzerland's largest banks
despite efforts to hold up the fusion pending settlement of
Holocaust claims, Swiss bankers said.
	   The state Banking Department's approval meant that the banks
need only the assent of the U.S. Federal Reserve to create one of
the world's biggest banks, said the Swiss Bankers Association.

New Bosnian Croat party can participate in September elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A new Bosnian Croat party
that emerged from the ruling nationalist Croatian Democratic Union
will be allowed to register for September elections, an
international official announced Thursday.
	   The announcement was an obvious sign of international support
for the breakaway party that may end the monopoly of the hard-line
ruling Croat party.
	   It split in two on Monday when the Bosnian Croat member of the
country's three-man presidency, Kresimir Zubak, decided to form his
own party together with his supporters, including several prominent
moderate Bosnian Croats of the ruling party.
	   Zubak said his decision was prompted by disgust over corruption
among the Bosnian Croat leadership.
	   The move delivered a serious blow to Croat hard-liners and
delighted international officials, who were, for the past several
months, trying to pressure Bosnian Croat leaders to stop
obstructing implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
	   While the period for registering political parties is over,
Robert Barry, the American diplomat heading the international
organization in charge of the elections, said all new political
parties arising from a registered party can be registered too. For
such parties, he said, the registration period will be extended
until July 1.
	   The decision was made Thursday at a meeting of Bosnia mission of
the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
or OSCE.

Nuclear powers seek common ground to defuse South Asian fears

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
rushed into an emergency session Thursday aiming to end the South
Asian arms race set off by Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   ``It is essential to create a situation to prevent nuclear
weapons from spreading,'' Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
told reporters before the meeting.
	   ``It is also of great value for us to achieve consensus on the
settlement of issues between Pakistan and India,'' Primakov said in
signaling what aides have been working on in hours of negotiations
before the meeting _ a communique that would offer mediation
services to ease tensions between the two countries over the
disputed territory of Kashmir.
	   A U.S. official said the document also would emphasize the
urgent need for India and Pakistan to rejoin the global
arms-control movement.
	   The meeting's chairman, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan,
said the five countries share ``a lot of common ground'' in trying
to contain the South Asian arms race.
	   The five delegations met at a U-shaped table in the room of the
United Nations' European headquarters where negotiators in 1996
thrashed out the global ban on nuclear weapons tests.
	   Tang sat at the bottom of the U, with British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on his left
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Primakov on his
right.
	   The foreign minister of another major country in the region,
Kamal Kharrazi of Iran, who also coincidentally was in Geneva,
appeared to support the general thrust of the session.
	   Fresh from visits to India and Pakistan, Kharrazi told
disarmament negotiators from 61 countries Thursday the ``lack of
serious intention'' by the five powers contributed to the arms
race.
	   But he said he preferred ``to concentrate on the positive'' and
backed efforts to defuse the tensions between Iran's neighbors.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   He said he had no plans to meet with any of the five.
	   Albright, who pushed for the meeting, met separately with
Primakov and Tang before the joint session.
	   She was mainly concerned with keeping the traditional Russian
tilt toward India, and Chinese support for Pakistan from preventing
the five powers from producing a strong joint statement, U.S.
officials said.
	   The United States is the only country among the five to impose
sanctions on both India and Pakistan, and Albright said she wasn't
pushing for anyone to join.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
said Albright. ``These two countries are cheek-by-jowl.''
	   As he sent Albright from Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton
promised to work to end the Asian rivals' nuclear competition.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.''
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They also are all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India.
	   Neither India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan nuclear power status without unraveling the
entire complex treaty negotiated in the late 1960s.
	   The ministers were examining other ways of bringing them into
global, step-by-step disarmament efforts, said officials.
	   ``We would like to discuss with our partners a position to put
an end to such experiences,'' a Russian mission spokeswoman said.

Alcatel chief says DSC buy complements U.S. telecom activity
</HEADLINE>
  RETRANSMITTING  
  Eds: INCORPORATES US-DSC-Alcatel; UPDATES with shares falling
further  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alcatel Alsthom announced Thursday it has agreed to
buy Dallas-based DSC Communications Corp. in a dlrs 4.4 billion
share swap aimed at giving vitality to its U.S. operations.
	   The two companies, which made the announcement simultaneously in
Paris and Texas, praised the move as beneficial to both sides.
Nevertheless, Alcatel shares fell sharply upon news of the
acquisition.
	   Paris-based traders said that 20 minutes after trading opened in
New York, shares fell by 7.8 percent, dragged down by arbitrage
between Alcatel's French shares and its New York Stock Exchange
Depository shares.
	   Traders here said that showed investor concern the acquisition
will be more dilutive than anticipated.
	   Serge Tchuruk, Alcatel's chairman and chief executive officer,
told journalists that Alcatel would have to issue 20 million new
shares, or approximately 12 percent of its capital due to the
transaction.
	   The acquisition will complement its U.S. telecommunications
network business and give Alcatel a jump-start in the networking
activities it has been interested in pursuing, Tchuruk said.
	   DCS specializes in certain aspects of fixed access systems such
as fixed line switches and transit switches, and also produces
local mobile switches as well as so-called intelligent networks.
	   Alcatel's U.S. operation focuses on transmission and has a
developing local access ADSL business.
	   ``We believe that DCS brings us what we are lacking,'' Tchuruk
said.
	   He said that while the group is not looking to acquire companies
in order to access technology, ``what we are lacking today is a
significant base to put into use these technologies.''
	   ``This transaction provides increased value to DSC
shareholders,'' said James L. Donald, DSC's chairman and chief
executive. ``In addition, DSC shareholders will have an ongoing
equity interest in a much larger company with improved long-term
growth potential and investment liquidity.''
	   Combined, DCS and Alcatel will have estimated 1998 sales of dlrs
4.5 billion. Tchuruk expects annual cost savings of dlrs 200
million, with 60 percent of that to be realized in 1999 and 90
percent to be realized in the year 2000.

Human rights commissioner pledges to improve Russian record
</HEADLINE>

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's human rights situation is ``awful,'' the
former Communist lawmaker appointed to monitor it said Thursday. He
also said some criminals deserve the death penalty and that Russia
was not ready to ban it.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament appointed Oleg
Mironov as Russia's second human rights commissioner last month,
ending a nearly three-year standoff with pro-reform lawmakers.
	   ``The situation is awful,'' Mironov said at a news conference,
referring to human rights and broader social issues such as crowded
jails, overdue wages and pensions, and lack of housing.
	   Mironov said he has already received hundreds of complaints and
expects more.
	   ``Russia is a long-suffering country, and there will be
complaints from millions indigent people,'' he said.
	   While pledging to defend the rights of all Russians ``in
accordance with the law, justice and conscience,'' Mironov said
some criminals deserve the death sentence.
	   He said Russia was not ready to honor its promise to ban the
death penalty made in January 1996 when it joined the Council of
Europe.
	   ``This is the goal we should be aiming at, but that doesn't mean
we must do it right now,'' he said, referring to polls that show
the majority of Russians support capital punishment as a deterrent
to crime.
	   The government imposed a moratorium on capital punishment and
says it has not executed anyone since August 1996.
	   Mironov's appointment followed a long battle between Communists
and pro-reform lawmakers, with both sides pushing their own
candidates for the job. The impasse was broken last month when both
sides agreed to divide several key posts between them.
	   Russia had no human rights officials until 1994 when parliament
appointed former Soviet dissident Sergei Kovalyov. Lawmakers fired
him the following year after his bitter criticism of President
Boris Yeltsin and parliament over the war against secessionist
Chechnya.
	   Mironov said his predecessor was wrong to have spent a long time
in the Chechen capital while it was under attack trying to persuade
the Russian government to stop the war.
	   ``I think that there is nothing for a human rights commissioner
to do where a war is raging,'' Mironov said. ``He can do nothing
there, that isn't his task.''
	   He also criticized Kovalyov for his failure to set up an office.
	   ``Regrettably, he has left anything for me, '' Mironov said.
``Couldn't he get a building for the commissioner's office equipped
with the necessary means of communications?''
	   Mironov, a former law professor, said he quit the Communist
Party after his confirmation and pledged that he will not be guided
by his ideology.

AMMAN, (Star)-Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdallah Ben Abdul

<TEXT>
Aziz arrived inAmman on a two-day visit for talks with King Hussein
on the stalled Arab-Israelipeace process, Arab issues and bilateral
relations, Monday.
	   Prince Abdullah, the highest-ranking Saudi official to visit
Jordan in 11 years, arrivedfrom Syria where he held similar talks
with President Hafez Assad.
	   In Damascus, Prince Abdullah warned Israel against ``excessive
self-confidence andexcessive imprudence,'' and urged Washington to
continue backing the peace process.
	   During their talks the King and the Saudi Crown Prince
reiterated their commitment tothe Arab-Israeli peace process. On
Tuesday, Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah ended a24-hour visit as part
of a diplomatic effort to convene an Arab summit.
	   ``Saudi Arabia and Jordan agree on the necessity to respect
agreements,'' signed withIsrael ``on the basis of international
resolutions and the principle of exchanging land forpeace,''
according to a government source.
	   Jordanian officials said the prince's talks with the Jordanian
leadership were focused onthe possibility of holding an Arab summit
on the deadlocked Middle East peaceprocess.
	   Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jawad Anani
said PrinceAbdullah's visit ``comes at a time when Arabs need to
unify their ranks,'' and to discuss''the possibilities of holding
an enlarged or mini-summit to help fulfill the Arab
nation'saspirations.'' The Prince's tour comes amidst a diplomatic
Arab activity to convene a summit aimedat forming a united Arab
front to confront Israel, which is blamed for obstructing theMiddle
East peace process.
	   Jordanian officials said Amman prefers holding a mini-summit,
since an enlargedmeeting could become bogged down over the many
other complex Arab issues, andprevent a unified position from being
achieved.
	   A joint statement issued after talks between Jordan's King
Hussein Prince Abdallahlate Monday, said the two sides agreed on
the ``necessity for careful preparation for anArab summit if it is
convened.'' The statement said, ``Careful preparation is needed to
ensure Arab solidarity over theobstructed peace process and to
avoid splits relating to other issues.'' Saudi Ambassador to Jordan
Abdallah Sudeiri stressed that the visit of the CrownPrince to
Jordan had a special significance at this stage which requires
unifying Arabstands on the current developments in the region.
	   He said that the visit comes within the existing policy of
coordination and consultationsbetween the two countries'
leadership.

Chuck Martin has written a compelling piece on many of the key
business issues emerging from the Digital Estate (companies and
organisations which are creating and exploiting the digital media
which has the Internet at its heart) - the impact of the
interactive media on enterprise marketing, advertising,
relationship building, branding and the process of business
planning.
	   What makes the book readable is the fact that Martin explains it
all through the experience of successful Digital Estate companies
such as Virtual Vineyeards, Lego, Levi's, Yahoo!, Lombard

	   Pragmatism is the corner-stone of the book. It is centred on how
to plan and conduct your business on the Internet. This may put off
those who have come to regard the Net as a mere fad of the decade -
but it'll be a mistake to dismiss the book.
	   Yes, the Net seems phenomenally overhyped. But that's because
many think - wrongfully so - that marketing themselves on the World
Wide Web is all there is to doing business on the Net. But this
alone does not enable digital commerce (the buying and selling of
goods on the Net) or change the business or create growth
opportunities. You must do more than just look pretty on the Web;
you have to go beyond the traditional Net applications (often
dubbed `brochureware').
	   The book is rich with examples: Virtual Vineyeard not only
provides information about its vineyard but enables customers to
purchase wine.
	   Levi's doesn't merely advertise jeans on the Net, but enables
customers to design and manufacture their own pair using its
network of Levi's Personalised Pair Program. Sportsline uses
digital cash to take full advantage of celebrity chats with
superstars like Michael Jordan. Instead of creating an Intranet
with information about the human resource policies of your company,
you can create a personal home page for each employee where he or
she will be able to, in confidence, review career plans,
compensation history, evaluations and progress.
	   These companies belong to `the second generation' of the Web.
Where the first generation was informational, the second is
creating new businesses or transforming old business models on the
Net. These companies, says Martin, are total believers in the
coming digital economy and they will actually make it happen. They
understand that the Net facilitates the marriage of content and
technology and that change is the rule, not the exception.
	   What this book tells you is that the fundamental value of the
Internet is to increase productivity, improve performance, develop
and procure new businesses and get companies connected to
customers. All you need to start a global business are not bricks
and mortar but a website and effective utilisation of Net
technology. Martin gives tips on how to drive surfers to a business
website: create valuable or appealing content; create valuable
service; heavily promote your business to drive mass traffic to
your site; target a specific audience; create a community of
like-minded individuals; reward the consumer for visiting, and so
forth.
	   Rest assured that this book is not about a mere techno-trend.
You will be surprised at the various, ingenious Web applications
pursued by companies in the name of business. Martin doesn't leave
readers gasping in awe at the exploits of the companies, but he
enlightens you on how you, too, can create and conduct your
business on the Net.
	   A new game, however, requires a new set of rules. Martin devotes
a chapter on the rules of business Netiquette (Net Etiquette) - the
standard of behaviour that governs the commercial development and
usage of the Net by companies within the Digital Estate. He
provides general guidelines and a list of 100 rules for keeping the
relationship between consumers and businesses a healthy and happy
one. There is a caveat, however: rules of conduct are never written
in stone, but grow and evolve with the world they are meant to
order.
	   It is up to the companies to abide by Netiquette. Judging from
the junk mail many surfers receive, many companies violate the rule
that they should not post unsolicited mail.
	   From a business perspective, The Digital Estate is useful and
should be added to your collection of books on the Net and
cyber-revolution. If you suffer from techno-phobia, have no fear.
The book is extremely readable and may spur you to log on to the
Net to check some of those interesting sites he mentioned. And
don't waste Martin's cyberwisdom. As Rule 100 says: `Be an active
participant in building the interactive environment.' Copyright

Jockey Willie Ryan gets last-minute mount
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS quote from Ryan in 6th graf  

<TEXT>
	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ If reigning English Derby winning jockey
Willie Ryan believes in coincidences, then he will start the 1998
classic Saturday exuding confidence.
	   Last year's winner did not even have a mount until Thursday when
he was unexpectedly named to ride the Aidan O'Brien-trained
Saratoga Springs.
	   The same thing happened last year when Ryan was a late call-up
to ride Benny The Dip, which _ like Saratoga Springs _ had won the
Dante Stakes at York.
	   Before learning he had a mount for Saturday, Ryan was
philosophical about last year's achievement.
	   ``It was a great day and it is something that will always live
with you,'' he said. ``It's a race that every jockey wants to win _
obviously it is something I would like to do again.''
	   ``Saratoga Springs is obviously a good horse. He stays, and he
has got a good chance,'' he added, noting he didn't expect to ride
the colt before race day.
	   Prior to his 1997 Derby win, Ryan had only three previous rides
in the Derby and was thrown off Foyer in the race in 1994.
	   He was chosen for Saratoga Springs ahead of Christy Roche, who
rode Second Empire to third place in the Irish 2,000 Guineas last
month.
	   Roche, who won the 1984 Derby on Secreto, is O'Brien's
first-choice jockey in Ireland but does not ride for the trainer in
England.
	   The center of attention in England's most famous flat race
continues to be Cape Verdi, who is attempting to become the first
filly since 1916 to win the Derby.
	   And there's another piece of history in the offing.
	   For the first time since 1917, the winner of the 1,000 Guineas
(Cape Verdi) will face the 2,000 Guineas winner (King of Kings) in
the Derby.
	   The only withdrawal Thursday was Pegnitz, a long-shot, reducing
the field to 15.
	   Saratoga Springs was an unexpected starter, the least-favored of
three horses in the Derby trained by Irishman O'Brien. But Ryan
will not be perturbed by his last minute call for the race.
	   Last year he was third in line to ride Benny The Dip, stepping
in when Frankie Dettori and Olivier Peslier withdrew. He rode a
memorable race at Epsom, kicking for home early in the straight and
just beating Silver Patriarch by a short head.
	   Second Empire is the betting favorite for Saturday, ahead of
Greek Dance. Other strongly backed starters are Gulland, City
Honors and Courteous.

There are shock waves in the public sector at the moment, as

<TEXT>
employees bracethemselves for the worst. With the onset of
restructuring in the civil service more andmore employees are
certain to face redundancies in the very near future.Officials say
that the public sector is ``overloaded'' with more than 30,000
employees''unneeded''. As from 1 June, the government began
trimming down the civil service toreduce expenditure and eliminate
what is termed as ``administrative sluggishness'',something that is
badly reflected on the economy.
	   The Cabinet has recently approved a resolution to cut the rate
of expenditure in thepublic sector by 10 percent and reduce the
number of employees by two percent.
	   That would actually mean firing about 4000 people from their
jobs.Has this action been taken haphazardly or is it the outcome of
a detailed scientificstudy? No one denies that with between
160,000-200,000 employees in 75 publicinstitutions, the public
sector is over-employed costing the state millions of dinars.
	   Asked about the reasons for this, Minister of Administrative
Development Dr BassamAl Umoush told The Star ``work opportunities
[in the public sector] are offeredaccording to defined schedules
and of the needs of each ministry or public institution.
	   However, in light of the economic situation, the government
can't expand in creatingnew job opportunities nor it can totally
cancel new vacancies.'' According to the Minister, the laying off
people will in no way affect productiveemployees. ``Certainly,
those who have a bad record will be the ones to go. It alsomeans
that the whole process will be implemented according to a well
thought outsystem,'' confirmed Dr Umoush.
	   One of the suggestions to curtail additional expenses was to
approve a two-dayholiday. A recent opinion poll conducted by the
Ministry revealed that about 70percent of employees agree with the
idea. ``There was also another poll released by theMinistry of
Finance, but naturally we don't build decisions on polls,'' Dr
Umoush said.
	   A comprehensive scientific study is the key to come up with a
decision that givesconsideration to all the dimensions regarding
these proposals.
	   Dr Umoush attributes the current economic situation which
requires greater austeritymeasures, to the nature of Jordan's
economy. ``Jordan is a country which depends, to agreat extent, on
external aid, and most of its economic activities base their
success onthe Iraqi market, in terms of promoting output or
exchanging commercial ties.''Meanwhile Iraq is still suffering from
UN sanctions which is blocking free access ofJordanian products to
that country.In addition to this, tough measures imposed by Israel
are hindering economic ties withour closest market, the Palestine
National Authority, and this causes further losses forJordanian
manufacturers and exporters.
	   What also worsens the situation is that Jordan has been the
resort for many Palestinianswho immigrated from their homeland to
the Kingdom in 1948 and 1967. Moreover,the return of about half
million expatriates from the Gulf, following the war in 1990
hasworsened the situation. .
	   These factors have also helped to increase the average rate of
unemployment in thecountry.
	   ``The minister who is enthusiastic about leading a new era of
change, said that theMinistry of Administrative Development is a
youthful one, established in 1994, and inits present form can only
offer administrative consultation for ministries and
governmentinstitutions.But if authorized to carry out more activity
such as supervising the performance ofthese institutions, it will
then have a more vital and beneficial role.
	   The Minister is concerned about the issue of unemployment and is
currently working ona proposal to hold a national conference to
tackle this issue.
	   Official statistics put the average rate of unemployment at 14.4
percent, but othersources, such as the Strategic Studies Center,
estimate the figure at 24 percent ormore.
	   ``Regardless of the real figure, official or unofficial, the
14.4 percent is not small, so weadmit that there is a problem,'' Dr
Umoush explained.
	   But Jordan is not the only country which suffers from this
problem; it is a global one.
	   ``As for Jordan, this is the problem which affects every house,
and that is why we wishto organize the conference and all parties,
associations, professional unions, parliament,ministries,
academics, journalists, economic experts, lawyers, vocational
traininginstitutions and centers, can participate.
	   The three-day conference, which will convene on 17 August, will
be a goldenopportunity for the private sector to participate in the
open dialogue to solve thisproblem which continues to threaten the
economy in Jordan.
	   Based upon much scientific study, the 11 working papers for
discussion hope toachieve tangible results.The Ministry advises
that after the paper is presented, those parties wishing tocomment,
should provide alternative answers to those currently on the table.
This willenhance constructive dialogue during the conference.
	   ``One paper is expected to tackle the issue of unemployment from
a different angle,asking if it is really a combination of a lack of
vacancies and the economic situation, oris it purely because of
what is termed as ``a shame culture,'' said Dr Umoush. If it
isbecause of a shame culture-meaning that Jordanian won't shun
certain jobs because ofwhat they regard as menial-let any
participant suggest ways of eliminating suchconcepts and speak
about his experience in this regard.The Minister pointed out that
``We depend to a large extent on the participation of theprivate
sector,'' Having a total of about 25,000 privately-owned
establishments. The minister suggeststhat if every company
volunteers to offer at least one vacancy, then 25,000 new
jobopportunities could be created.This idea itself would be a great
achievement.

PETRONAS Gas Bhd is gradually being transformed from a gas

<TEXT>
processor and transporter to a utility-based company, chairman Tan
Sri Mohamad Hassan Marican said.
	   Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday, he said with integrated petrochemical complexes (IPCs)
coming onstream, the company's core business would be enhanced with
utilities-based activities.
	   ``Our biggest commitment now is the centralised utility facility
(CUF) in Kertih, Terengganu, to provide utilities to petrochemical
companies,'' he said, adding that revenue from the CUF would be
seen in the current financial year ending March 31, 1999.
	   Its CUF project involves the supply of value-added utilities
such as steam, electricity, oxygen, nitrogen, demineralised water,
waste water treatment and compressed air to the IPCs in Kertih and
Gebeng in Kuantan.
	   CUF is expected to start supplying utilities to its first
customer by the middle of next year.
	   ``Initially, the revenue from utilities will be small but as the
IPCs come onstream from 1999 till 2001, we can expect utilities to
contribute significantly to the company's earnings.''
	   Mohamad Hassan said the company's fifth and sixth gas processing
plants, costing more than RM1 billion, were due to come onstream in
August and October, eventually increasing production capacity to
2,000 million standard cubic feet per day.
	   On plans to link the Peninsular Gas Utilisation pipeline to the
Trans-Thailand-Malaysia Gas Pipeline System at Changlun, Kedah, he
said the pipeline which will come through Songkhla would be linked
with Changlun in the middle of 2001.
	   It will also provide additional ``security of supply'' to the
country and will make the Asean Gas Grid project a reality.
	   ``We have also been supplying gas to Singapore.''
	   On the company's prospects for the current year, Mohamad Hassan
said there would be an increased growth but did not disclose any
figures.
	   ``Our plants are running beyond capacity,'' he said.
	   For the financial year ended March 31, 1998, Petronas Gas
recorded a turnover of RM1.46 billion, an increase of 15.8 per cent
from RM1.26 billion the previous year.
	   Profit before taxation increased by 11.3 per cent from RM850.5
million to RM958.1 million.
	   The better overall performance was attributed to the higher
volume of feedgas processed and throughput delivery during the
year.

Thousands of electricity workers protest firing of directors

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of electricity workers
rallied in Bucharest Thursday to protest the firing of the entire
board of directors of the state electricity company Renel.
	   ``The new members of the board were appointed taking into
account political criteria, not their professional performance,''
Dumitru Chirita, leader of the Universe trade union told The
Associated Press.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Radu Berceanu recently overhauled
the boards of Renel and the national gas and oil companies,
accusing them of delaying free market reforms.
	   ``Down with the minister!'', ``We want reforms not policy!'', an
estimated 4,000 protesters shouted. Smaller protests were held
simultaneously in other parts of the country.
	   The dismissal of Renel's directors also angered the main
political party in the ruling coalition, the National Peasants'
Party, whose members were excluded from the board.
	   Berceanu, a prominent leader of the Democratic Party, a smaller
but influential partner of the coalition, defended his decision to
appoint an apolitical board.
	   `` I will not change my mind and if the new directors do not do
their job, I shall fire them too,'' he said.

I SPEND five dinars every month and sometimes more, to buy

<TEXT>
lottery tickets hopingone day I will be the lucky winner,'' said
Atta Murad, a worker in a modest restaurantin Zarqa.
	   ``I have been doing it for the last four years, I've never quit,
and now buying lotterycards has turned me into an addict,'' Murad,
who only earns JD 120 per month, added.
	   ``I have many commitments. I have to pay the rent for my
apartment, and buy specialmilk for my two children, and then their
are my cigarettes,'' Murad explained.
	   Seeking to do what they regard as the quick way to get rich,
people become hookedon buying what they call their ``dream
ticket.'' ``I used to choose the card number myself, then after a
while I became convinced that Ineeded a fortunate touch'' said
Lana, who works in one of the factories in Amman.
	   ``Nowadays, I let my child choose one of the cards, then I pray
it would be the winningnumber.'' However, up until now, Lana hasn't
won any prizes, but she forcefully saysthat she won't give
up.However, for some people carrying lottery tickets has its own
rituals.''For me the only thing I do when I have tickets is I pray
repeatedly, and sometimes Icount the cards till I reach the date of
my birthday.'' But this has proved a day-dreamfor Jamal, who is a
university student.But, suppose you were the lucky guy and you had
all the right numbers for the firstprize. What would you do?
``Maybe I will faint for a long time before I buy a house, acar, a
mobile.....'' Jamal just continued to make demands.
	   Every two weeks there is a draw for the lottery that is run by
one charitableorganization in Jordan. The prices of tickets
contribute to the social service that thecharity provides. The
lottery is also one way of creating jobs for the unemployed.
	   ``I still have lottery cards from two years ago, in turn I have
a proportion of eachamount I sell'' said Yousef Radi, a lottery
peddler.
	   ``I take the rest of the tickets back to those that are
responsible before the draw,otherwise, I would have to pay for the
missing tickets.'' But Radi himself has beendrawn to the lottery
fever.''Each time I buy three or four cards, but all I have won so
far is simple prizes, butnever mind, I will continue,'' he says
mischeviously.
	   ``I become very nervous when I watch the wheels of numbers turn
around, fearing that Ialready sold the wining ticket to somebody
else,'' Radi adds.
	   The first lottery was established in the Kingdom in 1972.
	   ``In those days the price of the ticket was 250 fils while first
prize reached JD 5,000,''said Mr Suheil Al Haddid, director of
lottery at the General Union of the CharitableSocieties (GUCS).
	   Since 1972 until now, nothing has changed in the running of the
lottery, except the tagprice of lottery tickets have gone up, as
well as the cash prizes of course. Al Haddidpoints out that the
demand for tickets differs from one period to another.
	   ``It's good to support charitable work, but if you are sincere,
you can develop a moreintimate relationship with the needy instead
of using technical methods'' says Dr HaniAbd Al Rahman, a professor
in educational administration at the University of Jordan.
	   ``We need to show that the economic differences have not
destroyed the socialdimensions,'' Dr Hani, who has never bought a
lottery ticket, suggests.

WHEN IKEA opened its first Malaysian store in 1996, houseproud

<TEXT>
Klang Valley residents with urbane tastes were particularly glad.
At last, no need for trips across the Causeway to get home decor
items with the Scandanavian touch.
	   Indeed, the furniture retail giant is a latecomer among major
Swedish players to make it to our shores. Volvo, Ericsson, SKF,
Electrolux, Scania - few things in the corporate world are as
identifiably Swedish as these, and each have a significant presence
here.
	   Several Swedish multinational corporations have been in Malaysia
for many years and have become fixtures in the local commercial
landscape.
	   Others, mainly due to the nature of their businesses, are not
quite household names. Still, they often show up in joint-ventures,
one-off projects and tender bids.
	   The overall indication is that Sweden has always seen Malaysia
as a fertile ground for investment opportunities. Here is a look at
how some Swedish giants have made their mark in Malaysia: Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB): Actually a Swiss-Swedish entity following a
merger, ABB is the world's largest power engineering group. Its
involvement in Malaysia dates back to 1904, when the country's
first power generator was installed by MFO Oerlikon, today part of
ABB's worldwide operations.
	   ABB's business here is built largely on the design and
construction of power plants for Tenaga Nasional Berhad and
independent power producers.
	   Other major projects included steel plants, supply of electrical
equipment to the oil industry and the electrification of the
national railway system.
	   A recent project is the second-phase expansion of the Titan
Group's petrochemical complex in Pasir Gudang, Johor. ABB Power
Generation Sdn Bhd, which serves as the group's power generation
centre for the Asia Pacific, was among the six principal
contractors who signed the RM3 billion deal last November.
	   In 1996, ABB generated about 19 per cent of its sales in Asia,
including US$ 958 million (US$ 1  RM3.80) in Malaysia. It had about
750
employees in Malaysia that year. ABB chief executive Goran Lindahl
recently said ABB employs nearly 400 engineers in Malaysia who deal
exclusively with systems that help run power plants.	   Last October, the ABB group of companies in Malaysia went
through a localisation programme and appointed Zubir Zainal as
group managing director and chief executive officer. Three other
Malaysians were made managing directors of ABB Transmission and
Distribution Sdn Bhd, ABB Contracting Sdn Bhd, and ABB Industrial
and Building Systems Sdn Bhd.
	   Astra: The pharmaceutical giant is represented here by Astra
Pharmaceutical Sdn Bhd (Astra Malaysia), which distributes
medicines related to gastroenterology, respiratory and
cardiovascular problems. It also supplies anaesthetic products.
	   Astra Malaysia is in the top five of the Astra group
subsidiaries worldwide. Last year, it was the fastest growing
subsidiary in Southeast Asia.
	   Astra Malaysia earned RM32 million in turnover last year.
Interestingly, its sales of asthma-related products, the main
contributor to its income, increased by more than 20 per cent due
to the haze. It expects its Malaysian sales and profits to swell by
40 per cent this year on the back of the growth of the local
healthcare services.
	   Atlas Copco: The company was founded as Atlas AB in 1873 to
manufacture, buy and supply materials for the Swedish railway
system. It is now a multinational engineering group with three main
areas of specialisation: air and gas compression and expansion,
construction and mining, and industrial techniques.
	   Its Malaysian unit, Atlas Copco (M) Sdn Bhd, began operations in
1982.
	   Together with its previous representation by Guthrie
Engineering, the Atlas Copco brand has been in Malaysia for over 25
years.
	   By the end of 1995, the company had invested RM25 million in
Malaysia, including RM1.5 million in its premises at Lion
Industrial Park, Shah Alam.
	   Bofors: As a developer and manufacturer of weapons systems for
army, naval and air forces, Bofors is one of the more recognisable
names in the global defence industry.
	   It has maintained ties with Malaysia over the years. The
company, for example, helped overhaul old and defective army mortar
bombs under a transfer of technology programme with local defence
equipment company, SME Technologies Sdn Bhd. The RM5 million
refurbishment programme, which began in June 1992, was said to save
the Malaysian army between 35 and 40 per cent in costs if it were
to buy new ammunition.
	   In 1994, Bofors was among four Swedish companies which submitted
tenders to manufacture components for six Royal Malaysian Navy
offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), which comprise the first phase of
the Navy's plans to build 27 patrol vessels within the next seven
years.
	   Bofors offered its range of 40mm and 57mm guns as armaments for
the OPVs. The company was willing to manufacture components and
ammunition for the guns in Malaysia.
	   Early this year, PSC Industries Bhd announced that a subsidiary,
Penang Shipbuilding and Construction Sdn Bhd, had signed a
joint-venture agreement with Bofors to supply, install, integrate,
test and commission medium-range guns.
	   Electrolux: The world's largest major home appliance group first
set foot in Malaysia in the early 1970s and became a pioneer in the
local direct sales industry. Its Malaysian subsidiary, Electrolux
(Malaysia) Holdings Sdn Bhd, was set up in 1974 and recorded a
RM120 million turnover in its 20th year.
	   Electrolux operations in Malaysia include a factory in Shah
Alam, and a network of retailers and its own Home Centre outlets.
	   Electrolux subsidiary, Husqvarna AB, recently launched
solar-powered and battery-powered lawnmowers here through a local
distribution agent.
	   Ericsson: Easily one of the more familiar Swedish brands in
Malaysia, Ericsson is having a busy year so far. In February,
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
launched Wisma Ericsson, the headquarters of the Ericsson companies
in Malaysia, at Kelana Jaya.
	   Ericsson's Malaysian activities principally cover
telecommunications and information technology, and netted RM1
billion in revenue last year. This is expected to increase
substantially when the company expands its Shah Alam mobile phone
plant.
	   Export sales of the plant, which began operations last November,
is expected to reach between RM500 million and RM1 billion for its
first full year of operations.
	   Ericsson will also establish a RM40 million regional data and
multimedia processing hub in Kuala Lumpur to serve the Asia Pacific
region.
	   Another important development is Ericsson's involvement in the
Multimedia Super Corridor project via Ericsson Hewlett-Packard
Telecommunications Sdn Bhd.
	   Ikea: One of Ikea's 140 stores in 28 countries is the outlet in
the 1 Utama shopping centre in Bandar Utama, Petaling Jaya. It was
opened in April 1996 and boasts 8,000 square metres of retail
space.
	   According to Ikea Pte Ltd (Malaysia) general manager Erik Donker
Duyvis, there had been plans to open five more Ikea stores (one
each in Penang and Johor Baru, and the rest in Kuala Lumpur) but
these have been put on hold due to the economic downturn.
	   Ikea Malaysia's turnover for 1996 was RM60 million. Last April,
Duyvis was quoted as saying sales for the year to date had
increased by 25 per cent, which was ahead of the growth forecast of
12 to 20 per cent. He attributed this to a move last year to reduce
prices by 15 per cent.
	   However, Duyvis said he expected the momentum to slow down in
the coming months as the effects of the downturn sank in. He added
that there were plans to make more Ikea furniture locally, 'but
Malaysia has yet to produce them in high volumes'.
	   Scania: In March 1996, the heavy truck and bus manufacturer
relocated its regional office from Bangkok to Wisma PKNS in
Petaling Jaya. The regional office coordinates sales and service
operations in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and the
Indochinese peninsula.
	   The move came after the company identified Southeast Asia as a
region with strong growth, particularly in highway networks which
could support Scania's heavy vehicles.
	   Tractors Malaysia Holdings Bhd is the exclusive local
distributor for Scania. At the end of 1995, about 1,550 Scania
vehicles were operating in Malaysia. Intrakota buses are the most
visible examples.
	   Skanska: One of Sweden's largest construction and real estate
corporations, Skanska set up Skanska Bina (M) Sdn Bhd in Malaysia
in 1994.
	   It serves as the group's regional office for Southeast Asia. Its
first major deal here was the RM66.5 million turnkey contract to
build the Langkawi Hospital for the Ministry of Health.
	   It was reported in 1996 that the Malaysian company was
negotiating to build a government hospital in Cameron Highlands.
	   SKF: SKF is a leading manufacturer of rolling bearings and
seals. In Malaysia, it is represented by SKF (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd
(the local sales unit formed in 1973) and SKF Bearing Industries
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, which commenced operations in 1992.
	   SKF Bearing Industries has a plant in Nilai, Negri Sembilan.
Built on a 6.4-hectare site, it cost over RM350 million and is said
to be the world's most modern bearing factory.
	   In January 1997, SKF Bearing Industries began operating College
Asia in Nilai. The college offers management and industrial
training programmes for SKF staff in the Asia Pacific region.
	   Tetra Laval: Tetra Laval is the result of a 1993 merger of Tetra
Pak and Alfa Laval. The processing and packaging equipment
supplier's presence in Malaysia is through Tetra Pak (Malaysia) Sdn
Bhd.
	   Tetra Pak entered the local scene in 1967 when it installed its
first fillng machine on the premises of beverage producer Yeo Hiap
Seng.
	   A January 1997 report quoted Tetra Pak Malaysia MD Johan Cavalli
as saying another RM100 million will be invested in the Malaysian
liquid food packaging industry over the next three years.
	   Tetra Pak Malaysia, he added, will pour funds into training of
personnel, new software and its straw factory.
	   Volvo: Volvo is probably the most widely recognised Swedish
name. In Malaysia, Federal Auto Cars Sdn Bhd is the sole importer
and distributor of Volvo cars in Malaysia. The company essentially
evolved in 1994 from the former car division of its 35-year-old
parent company, Federal Auto Holdings Berhad.
	   In March, Federal Auto Cars launched its first used-car centre,
showcasing Volvos priced from as low as RM20,000. Volvo Car Asia
Pacific (Pte) Ltd's market vice-president in Malaysia, Kees A
Roldanus, said he was confident of the local market. `I believe
sales will improve. In fact we are targeting our sales to double by
the time the economy recovers,' he said.

CYGAL Bhd announced yesterday that it has applied to the Kuala

<TEXT>
Lumpur High Court on March 21 to strike out the petition filed by
interior design company Syarikat Lian Ping Enterprise Sdn Bhd to
wind up Cygal over non-payment of RM3.2 million.
	   On Tuesday, it was reported that Syarikat Lian Ping had claimed
in its petition that Cygal owes it RM3,135,451.31 for interior
decorations done in a hotel under construction in Johor Baru.
	   Apart from the principal sum, Syarikat Lian Ping was said to
also seek from Cygal financing charges of RM74,907.22 and legal
costs of RM5,000.
	   Both parties signed a contract on April 2, 1996, to do interior
fitting for suites and corridors at Grand Bluewave Hotel for RM8.3
million.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping said that upon the completion of work, the
architect of the hotel, MNA Architect, had duly certified payment
to Cygal.
	   MNA Architect had not recommended to Cygal any deductions
against the sum due. There were no circumstances justifying any
deduction or set-off, Syarikat Lian Ping said.
	   In a response to a query from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange,
Cygal executive director Syed Zain Al-Kudcy Syed Mahmood said a
dispute has arisen between Cygal and the developer of the Grand
Bluewave Hotel for amounts due to the various parties that
undertook the interior fitting job.
	   However, he added that the dispute is currently being
arbitrated.
	   He said the company believed that it has a strong case to set
aside the petition based on several reasons.
	   These include, among others, failure by Syarikat Lian Ping to
adhere to provisions for arbitration provided in the contract.
	   Syed Zain also said Cygal is solvent, having recently announced
its preliminary results with a profit after tax of at least RM9.4
million.
	   Having discussed with its auditors, the company is confident
that barring unforeseen circumstances there will not be a material
deviation from the profit as announced to the KLSE, he added.
	   The hearing has been fixed for June 9 before the High Court of
Kuala Lumpur to decide on the company's application.
	   ``As the case is currently pending court hearing, the company
shall make further announcements of the matter in due course.''

A new press court. A strange but novel idea one may first think,

<TEXT>
yet it is beingactively considered among judicial circles. Taher
Hikmat of the Higher Judicial Councilsaid that in the very near
future there would be the setting up of a court that
dealsexclusively with press and publications. Hikmat, who also
heads the Cessation Court,says that he believes that the solutions
to the problems of the press lies within the pressbody itself,
adding that journalists should exercise greater self-discipline. He
pointedout that ``he hoped that the journalist wouldn't be
transferred to the courts except incases in which it is deserved.''

THE last decade or so belonged to the workers. Thanks to the

<TEXT>
nation's rapid economic growth and the lack of skilled manpower in
some sectors, workers had the enviable position of being able to
dictate terms to the management.
	   The tight labour market forced wages to skyrocket - at a much
faster pace than that of productivity. Labour cost per employee
grew at a rate of 6.9 per cent last year while productivity growth
managed only 5.7 per cent. In 1996, labour cost per employee grew
at a rate of 9.28 per cent while productivity was at 5.83 per cent.
	   But not anymore.
	   As a result of the current economic slowdown afflicting the
region, a new trend is emerging. Wages are slowly approaching a
more equitable level in relation to productivity. And as a result,
an old issue rears its head again.
	   Productivity-Linked Wage System (PLWS) is not new. It has been
bandied about for as long as anyone cares to remember. The logic
behind it is simple: if an employee meets and exceeds the
performance parameters set for him, then he should be rewarded.
Those who fall short would naturally have a less-than-healthy bank
balance at the end of the year.
	   `I think PLWS is the key to greater productivity and
efficiency,' says National Productivity Centre director-general
Ismail Adam. As if to strengthen his belief, the 1997 Productivity
Report also states that to ensure that wage increases commensurate
with productivity, companies should make efforts to adopt the PLWS.
	   `The implementation of the PLWS would enable both employers and
employees to obtain a fair share of the gains arising from
productivity and performance improvements. The main drawback
identified in the present wage system is the inadequate link
between reward, productivity and performance,' it states.
	   Ismail adds: `We achieved full employment in 1991, well ahead of
our projected target of the year 2000. That has led to upward
pressures on wages. Add to that the demand for skilled workers;
there were just not enough of them in the labour market. When that
happens, you get a situation where employers dangle the high-wage
carrot to attract workers who may not even meet the requirements
and expectations of the employer.
	   In the end, you're paying a fortune for workers who do the same
amount of work.' That is why it is necessary for companies to make
sure that the increase in wages goes hand-in-hand with increasing
productivity. Advocates of the PLWS say that in the long run, it
will ensure the competitiveness of the various sectors and the
economy as a whole.
	   `Back when things were fine, the attitude was ``Share and share
alike'',' says a management consultant. That, he says, bred a sense
of complacency.
	   Some adopted the attitude, `Why worry? At the end of the year,
we'll still get our bonuses ...' Realising this, a solution was
needed, and quickly. `The guidelines for the Wage Reform System
were the result of discussions between representatives of industry
and their employees,' the consultant adds.
	   `Then, in August, the National Labour Advisory Council announced
that they were adopting the guidelines for wage reform.' The
guidelines were to establish a closer link between wages and
productivity and simultaneously enhance competitiveness and promote
employment stability. It also would enable employers to develop a
wider and systematic approach towards improving productivity and
wages through the active involvement and cooperation of their
employees. Finally, it would enable employees to obtain a fair
share of gains that arise from productivity growth and performance
improvements as well.
	   The six elements of the system are: 1) That wages would cover a
combination of monthly or other frequent payments, annual
increments, an annual or other infrequent bonus; 2) That wages
shall comprise a fixed component which in cludes basic wage and an
additionalcomonent in the form of variable payment; 3) That the key
elements of the fixed component are: basic wage, annual increment,
and contractual bonus (where applicable). The variable component
comprises wage increase for the year based on a
productivity/profit-sharing formula; 4) That changes in the basic
wage shall take into account factors including changes in the cost
of living; 5) That the fixed wage component should reflect the
value of the job and annual increments paid are in recognition of
the employee's length of serviceand experience; and 6) That the
variable component of wages could be determined in relation to
productivity and the performance of the individual, work group or
organisation. The indicators used must be transparent and
measurable.
	   Consideration must also be given by parties to the timing of
payment of the variable wage component.
	   There are three models for the system: the Profitability model,
the Productivity model, and a combination of the two.
	   In the case of the Profitability model, the fixed component can
be divided into the basic wage, an annual increment and a
contractual bonus.
	   A variable component performance bonus is to be determined by a
profit- sharing formula which must be agreed upon between the
management and union and spelt out in the collective agreement or
through consultation for the non-unionised sector. Another option
is for wage incentives to be paid out when profits have exceeded a
pre-determined level based on return on investment, return on
assets, return on equity and the average profit earned over a
number of years.
	   The Productivity model's fixed component remains the same as
that of the Profitability model. The variable component, though, is
another matter. It requires the management and union to negotiate
on the incentive increase for the year based on productivity
improvement.
	   The wage incentive for the year should also be commensurate with
productivity improvement. The agreed total wage increase less the
annual increment is given as a variable productivity payment on a
periodic basis.
	   Also, the variable productivity payment shall be dependent on
the performance of the company. In some instances, if the company
registers a drastic drop in performance, payment may not even be
made.
	   `The main problem now is transparency,' says Latiff Sher
Mohamed, an authority on Malaysian labour law. He believes that
although it is difficult, the problem is not insurmountable.
	   Employees see this form of wage system as an opportunity for
employers to weasel their way out of giving workers their due.
`Right now, people are not prepared to commit simply because of
this reason,' says Latiff.
	   `That's why you have to make sure that there is a series of
``filters'' to guarantee that everything is done right. What we
have to do now is to break this barrier. Everything should be in
relation to productivity.'

Greece, Turkey agree to defuse tension in Aegean Sea, Solana says
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS Turkish reaction. No pickup  

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Thursday that Greece and Turkey have agreed to a series of
confidence-building measures on sharing the Aegean Sea.
	   These measures are based on two memoranda of understanding,
which Greece and Turkey reached in 1988 that were never
implemented. At the time, both countries agreed to respect each
other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and their rights to
use the high seas and international airspace of the Aegean, Solana
said.
	   In a statement, Solana said that in the course of his continuing
talks with NATO members Greece and Turkey, both sides ``informed
him of their intention to implement fully the agreements reached in
1988.''
	   The Turkish foreign ministry released a statement Thursday in
which it welcomed Greece's acceptance of the measures.
	   Turkey hopes the agreement will lead to a ``positive and safe
environment in the Aegean that will contribute to a peaceful
solution to all problems between the two countries,'' the statement
said.
	   The 1988 agreement also called for both sides to halt military
maneuvers in the Aegean in July and August. Both Turkey and Greece
hold regular exercises in the Aegean, where they have come close to
war over territorial disputes.
	   Earlier this month, the military affairs magazine Jane's Defense
Weekly reported that Turkish and Greek officers started meeting
secretly in recent months to ease tension.

BANK NEGARA'S prescription for insurance companies in 1996 may

<TEXT>
have been a bitter pill to swallow, but the medication seems to be
working.
	   Many insurance companies, especially those with a small capital
base, would have been in trouble with the current economic downturn
if not for Bank Negara's strict move to increase their capital
base, says S.V. Mony, an expert in the field with more than 34
years of experience, `The increase in paid-up capital was a good
move to strengthen the industry. If not, some companies, especially
the smaller ones, would have been in trouble now,' says Mony, who
is currently the Asia regional director of GIO Australia Holdings
Ltd.
	   Two years ago, Bank Negara came out with an almost completely
new Bill announcing wide-ranging measures to ensure that insurance
companies are well regulated and capitalised. The minimum paid-up
capital was set at RM50 million while to qualify for the proposed
Tier-1 status, companies were to have a paid-up capital of RM100
million. Although the companies were given until the end of the
year to comply, most of them had already met the specification.
	   The resulting Act also capped the amount of investments by
insurance companies on corporate securities to a maximum of 30 per
cent of their total funds available. This move was to ensure that
insurance companies remained solvent with limited exposure on
equities.
	   In the past two years, insurance companies, especially those
dealing with life insurance, have increased their investments in
corporate securities due to attractive returns compared to the
conventional investment instrument of fixed deposits. According to
preliminary statistics, total assets of life insurance companies at
the end of last year stood at RM24.18 billion, out of which
investments in corporate securities accounted for about 32 per
cent. For general insurance companies, exposure to corporate
securities formed 20.7 per cent of their total assets amounting to
RM12.04 billion as of end of last year.
	   Mony, who was previously the chairman of General Insurance
Corporation of India, says some companies will feel the pain due to
lower returns from investments in equities and a diminution in
value of assets. `This is especially so for life insurers who need
to declare dividends for policy holders. Some companies may declare
losses in their bottomline due to exposure to securities. But all
of them (insurance companies) should pull through,' he says.
	   Although investment in corporate securities carries more than a
fair amount of risk, Mony emphasises that it is something insurance
companies, especially life insurers, cannot do without. `Dealing in
equities is part and parcel of the insurance industry. You cannot
have the banana without the skin,' he says.
	   On the amount of capital an insurance company needs to weather
the current storm, Mony says it depends on a variety of factors as
insurance is a risk taking business. However, he stresses that the
days of the `small players' are numbered.
	   In tandem with the economic slowdown, Mony notes that insurance
companies will find a rise in claims while premium collections,
especially for motor insurance, will drop. `This is a common
feature that transpires during a recession. Many may feel it is a
quick way to settle bills. There are limited methods to overcome
this problem,' he says.
	   One way, suggests Mony, is to have stringent checks when there
is an application to increase the sum assured. It also helps to
have investigators of integrity. `Proving insurance fraud is not
easy. But with investigators of integrity, at least the facts can
be unveiled for the insurers,' he says.
	   Before joining GIO, Mony, 61, served in various capacities in
the insurance industry of India. He was handpicked by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development to serve as an adviser
for the development of the insurance industry in the Caribbean.
Among his biggest achievements was nurturing the insurance industry
in Barbados from scratch. On GIO's objectives in Malaysia, Mony
says their reinsurance business here contributes an encouraging
portion of GIO Australia's net profit of A$77.5 million for the
half year ended December 1997.
	   GIO, which is among the top 50 insurance companies in the world,
is one of the few reinsurers with expertise to underwrite
large-scale risk like satellites, oil and gas fields and aircraft.
	   GIO's total reinsurance business for the past three years in
Malaysia amounts to about RM75 million, which Mony feels is not too
bad an effort considering that competition is stiff with eight
other reinsurers based locally. `We are here with a long-term view
and so will stay on despite the economic difficulties. The turmoil
will pass. Reinsurance is a business of relationship and so there
is no quick fix to it,' he says.
	   `We like to understand the integrity and needs of those we are
working for. We are still in the process of looking at companies
and identifying which are the better bets for a long-term
business.' Besides reinsurance, GIO hopes to form a joint venture
with a local company to go into asset management. That, says Mony,
will lead to more active participation in the Malaysian markets.

In debt. A recent study showed that most of the municipal and

<TEXT>
rural affairs' councilsare in debt, and badly in need of
restructuring. The study which is carried out by theLocal Councils
Committee suggests that the best way to improve the public
servicesprovided to people through out the Kingdom is to merge the
local councils into nomore than 50 municipalities. This is an issue
that is on the agenda of the Ministry ofMunicipalities and Rural
Affairs. The study found some other interesting facts.
Thepercentage of employees who have a university degree is no more
that five percent,those who have a diploma is nine percent, but a
massive 86 percent for those whohave an education below a Secondary
School Certificate.

THE future workplace will be a technologically-driven

<TEXT>
environment featuring powerful products, some of which are
currently in the prototype stages of development.
	   A demonstration of British Telecom's (BT) Smart Space at a
recent exhibition in Birmingham in the English Midlands, provided a
glimpse of how a personal work enviroment could look in the next
millennium.
	   The ensemble consists of a desk and chair providing a
semi-immersive environment with a wrap-around projection screen and
three-dimensional (3-1)) sound.The work space on the concept chair
is a Liquid Crystal Display touchscreen positioned horizontally,
which according to BT research, helps increase efficiency by 20 per
cent.
	   Also featured is an on-screen keyboard that enables the user to
control everything at the touch of the display. A vertical screen
facing the chair, fed by two video projectors in the back of the
chair, is designed for applications such as videoconferencing.
	   Other uses include a telepresence experience, enabling the user
to manipulate the chair to control a remote camera anywhere in the
world As you swivel in this amazinq chair, you get a changing view
from the camera.
	   Too futuristic? Dr Alan Rudge, former chairman of BT's
Technology and Development Committee comments: `The future always
seems more distant than the past. It was not long ago (in the
1970s), when desktop computing, faxes and mobile phones were
non-existent, all telephones had rotary dialsand were wired to a
junction box on the wall and the UK's national network still
included manual exchanges .' Rudge observes that for the
non-specialists, the impact of tomorrow's multifaceted
technological revolution is unimaginable but predicts that two-way
multimedia links, videophones on the desk and lightweight portables
that will work anywhere in the world would be available in the next
decade. - LPS

THE British and Spanish trade representatives in Malaysia have

<TEXT>
both indicated that their companies are not pulling out from
Malaysia despite the current economic problems.
	   ``We are here for the long term as we take a strategic long-term
view.
	   The general opinion is that the market will pick up,'' said
British High Commission director for trade and investment Howard
Parkinson.
	   He said Malaysia was more important to Britain than Russia or
China (excluding Hong Kong) in terms of trade.
	   ``New investments are always ongoing, for example, the Hanson
Group are currently negotiating with the Sungai Way Group on some
quarrying joint venture.''
	   Spanish trade commissioner Gonzalo Ramos said the country was
also ``very optimistic about Malaysia.''
	   Both were speaking at a Press conference in Kuala Lumpur where
the five- day Industry Tradefair Malaysia (ITM) and MachineTool
Malaysia (IMX) exhibition opened yesterday.
	   Although both the UK and Spain expect bilateral trade with
Malaysia to dip this year as a result of the economic downturn, the
countries felt that Malaysian exports will pick up because of the
cheaper ringgit.
	   ``But this will depend on developments in the region. We see
this period as a consolidation period for Spanish companies in
Malaysia,'' said Ramos.
	   He added that the country was still interested in increasing its
investments in Malaysia but, ``will have to see how developments in
the region are like''.
	   Trade with Spain has grown at a phenomenal 40 per cent annually
to US$800 million (RM3.12 billion) from US$80 million since 1994
when bilateral trade started.
	   Last year, Malaysia exported goods and services worth US$540
million to Spain, while imports from Spain stood at US$300 million.
	   General machinery which included machine tools formed some 27
per cent of exports to Malaysia, followed by automotive components
at 20 per cent.
	   According to Ramos, Spain is the fifth biggest producer of
machine tools in Europe in terms of volume.
	   ``Machine tool is probably our strongest sector, apart from
energy.''
	   There are 115 companies manufacturing over 2,000 different
models of machine tools in Spain.
	   There are less than 20 Spanish companies in Malaysia, with most
in the machine tool business.
	   ``As far as I know, none of the companies have indicated that
they are pulling out, nor have I heard any cases of downsizing,''
Ramos said.

FOR SOMEONE whose fortune was built on a foundation of bricks

<TEXT>
and mortar of the property boom beginning in the late 1980s, Datuk
Patrick Lim Soo Kit can now well afford to lead a life of idle
luxury. With youth on his side, he certainly would not be out of
place in some trendy yuppie hangout.
	   On the contrary, this 33-year-old self-made man has not chosen
the debauched existence of the restless gadabout but has, instead,
opted for a life of productive toil to see through an equestrian
dream as a fitting tribute to the memory of his veterinarian
father, the late Dr George Lim Ah Soo.
	   It has been a productive toil indeed as within 10 years of his
first foray into the world of property development, Lim junior can
claim several illustrious buildings and projects in his property
portfolio, a glowing reputation and financial security in the
process.
	   Fittingly, this young man whose exterior equanimity belies what
must surely be fire burning in his belly, is set to notch another
grand achievement. He is preoccupied with his latest property
project, Equine Park in Serdang. (See story on page 28.) Equine
Park commands a premium as the mixed property and commercial
development is located within the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).
	   The MSC was, perhaps, just a germ of an idea broiling in the
fertile imagination of the prime minister when the 24-year-old Lim
returned after completing his education in Australia. He returned
armed with a degree in business majoring in economics and finance
management from Perth, Western Australia, in 1988. Malaysia then
was just about to climb out of recession. Family ties steered him
towards property development. His father-in-law invited him to lend
a hand in a project in Ampang which was facing some problems. The
team cobbled together for the task did its job.
	   `We steered the project out of the woods,' Lim says. The fruits
of their joint toil is now One Ampang Avenue.
	   Upon completion, the 640 units of apartment dwellings, a
four-storey office block and 20 four-storey shoplots were sold to
the Samling Corporation. This `baptism of fire' not only revived
the project but launched one greenhorn along the road of property
development.
	   Seriously, what was Lim's contribution to the resurrection of
One Ampang Avenue? `It wasn't just any one person's effort alone. I
was one of a number of people taken on by my father-in-law to help
out.' Indeed, Lim was a complete tiro with no inkling whatsover of
the intricacies of the property development business. He plunged in
headlong, fully-armed with nothing more than just bags of bravado,
plenty of gumption and a spirit of get up and go.
	   Having notched this maiden success, Lim `flew' from the `nest'
and embarked on his next property project. It involved taking on
what the previous developer left behind - the resurrection of Taman
Bukit Cahaya in Serdang which was an abandoned housing project. The
project comprised 145 shop houses, double-storey terraces,
middle-cost and single-storey low-cost homes. `This project was
completed without any external financing or funds from the federal
government,' says Lim.
	   He went `downmarket' further in his next project - the
redevelopment of Kampung Datuk Harun in Petaling Jaya. This
involved the relocation of squatters and the development of 72
low-cost apartments, 295 flats and 32 shoplots. Says Lim, `This
project was a test of how we handled the sensitive question of
rehousing and pricing the new homes for the squatters. We did not
ride roughshod over their demands nor did we cut corners in the
development.' After his first project (One Ampang Avenue), Lim
acquired equity interest in subsequent ventures in return for his
services. He is now listed as either director or shareholder of all
the property projects in which he had a hand. His business card
though now gives him the designation of executive chairman of Taman
Equine (M) Sdn Bhd - the developer of Equine Park in which he is
the majority shareholder.
	   The unique attraction of Equine Park, as the name suggests, is
its equestrian theme. Equine Park will be the home of the Royal
Selangor Equine Academy, the first ever equestrian educational and
recreational institution of its kind in this country. (See story on
page 29.) Taman Equine (M) Sdn Bhd is building the entire complex
and will be responsible for its funding. The academy was
established in 1995 by Lim's father with the objective of it being
the centre of excellence for education, sports, recreation and
career development in equestrian disciplines. That his father died
a year later served only to spur Lim even more to see the
equestrian academy project through to its ultimate fruition.
	   How did the equine connection come about? `When the development
was planned, I resolved not to rely on golf as its raison d'etre. I
wanted something which had a family theme, one which allowed for
mass participation involving the great outdoors,' says Lim.
	   He sought advice from his father who then mooted the equine
theme. And how would this emphasis on the Sport of Kings square up
with Lim's egalitarian ideals? `My father offered the Equine
Academy solution. His idea was to make equine sports accessible to
the masses,' says Lim.
	   The Lims' `equine' pedigree began with dad George whose
qualification as a veterinarian saw him working with horses for the
Penang and Ipoh turf clubs and the Malayan Racing Association
(MRA). George's own father was brought to the Malaya of the early
1940s from Sri Lanka to become the Taiping postmaster general. It
was there that he took a Chinese woman for his bride. (George
married an Australian which explains Patrick's pan-Asian features.)
As a young man, George was especially studious, winning a Colombo
Plan scholarship to study in Melbourne, Australia. Having qualified
as a veterinary surgeon in Australia, George returned to work in
the Penang and Perak Turf Clubs beginning in 1972. In between those
stints as a vet, Lim senior served the Tote Board as stipendary
steward for five years. These postings meant that Lim junior
practically grew up in a horse's saddle.
	   The equine academy can count on the services of Capt Mark
Phillips -an accomplished equestrian Olympian in his own right - as
consultant. It took Phillips, who is perhaps more famous as being
the former husband of Princess Anne, four visits over a couple of
years before he pronounced the academy as heading out of `grand
illusion-dom' into the realms of achievable dream. `I was over the
moon when Mark finally gave his seal of approval and offered his
congratulations. He added he was not exactly optimistic that the
project would come to fruition during the initial stages,' says
Lim.
	   Another smart move was getting the Alice Smith School to
relocate from its Jalan Bellamy premises to Taman Equine. The
school, which is run along the lines of a British private school,
attracts expatriates and wealthy local families who would
appreciate an early equestrian introduction for their offspring.
	   How is Lim and his flagship Taman Equine project coping now that
the property market is going through a spot of turbulence due to
the economic downturn? `The downturn has affected us, that is no
doubt. But we have taken appropriate measures to minimise its
impact,' he says.
	   Evidence that Taman Equine is not too adversely affected is in
the proposed expansion of staffing levels. There have been no
layoffs affecting its workforce of 40. In fact, Lim is looking to
employ more to spearhead a more aggressive sales and marketing
strategy.
	   Old hands might brand Patrick's `aggression' as misplaced
optimism fueled by youthful exuberance. Plainly, the very qualities
that have driven him to where he is today!

firms within the next twomonths according to what is regarded as a
new system of operations. First of alllicences will only be given
to firms who have more than a fixed number of taxis. Forinstance,
in Amman, new firms must have at least 70 taxis registered on their
books, forZerqa and Irbid, the number of taxis goes down to 50,
while in the rest of thegovernorates, only those firms with 25 cars
would be given a license to operate.
	   Furthermore the cars must be of the latest models. What is new
also is that all carswould be equipped with a radio system, to
facilitate communications between thedriver and the firm. The
purpose of this is to increase the workload. In addition to
thatonly drivers who are above 25 years-old will be given license.
However, the age limit is60.

	   The association is ``very pleased'' with the decision, said
spokesman Christoph Meyer. He said the association expects Fed
approval and that the merger might even be able to take place this
month as planned.
	   Meyer said the two banks had worked constructively with New York
authorities in recent weeks to satisfy all their concerns, mainly
with how they are handling the claims of the heirs of Nazi victims.
	   The Swiss Federal Competition Commission already has authorized
the link-up between Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corporation.
	   Some attempts have been under way in the United States to block
U.S. approval of the merger until the two banks and the other
largest Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, reach a global settlement with
heirs of Holocaust victims who claim the banks owe them money.
	   The merged bank, to be called United Bank of Switzerland, has
accepted the Swiss conditions and thereby made possible early
completion of the deal in Switzerland, the commission said.
	   In February, shareholders of both banks approved plans to merge.
	   With dlrs 627 billion in assets, the new UBS will be the second
largest bank worldwide behind Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The two banks expect the merger to come into effect in the
coming months. The banks have said they expect to have a group
profit by the year 2002 of 10 to 11 billion francs (dlrs 6.9 to 7.6
billion).
	   The combination is expected to lead to a loss of some 13,000
jobs worldwide. The banks have a combined work force of 56,000.

New probe begins into plane crash that killed Mozambican President
</HEADLINE>
Machel  
  Eds: ADDS in last graf more details of witnesses  

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission began a secret hearing Thursday into the 1986 air crash
that killed Mozambican President Samora Machel and 33 other people
aboard.
	   An earlier inquiry concluded pilot error caused the Russian-made
Tupelov plane to crash into a hill in eastern South Africa. The
plane was flying from Malawi to Mozambique.
	   Russian experts concluded the plane was following a decoy
signal, thinking it was transmitted from the airport in Maputo,
Mozambique.
	   Truth Commission spokesman Vuyani Green said evidence links
activities of the apartheid-era South African Defence Force to the
crash. He did not elaborate.
	   Suspicion that the South African government was involved was
high at the time because the apartheid regime tried to destabilize
Machel's government in neighboring Mozambique.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who is romantically
involved with Machel's widow Graca, has vowed to find the truth
about Machel's death.
	   South Africa's then-apartheid government denied it used false
signals from navigational beacons to lure the plane off course. An
International Civil Aviation Organization team said there was
nothing mysterious or sinister about the accident.
	   The Truth Commission is investigating apartheid-era atrocities,
and can give amnesty to those who fully confess to human rights
abuses.
	   Witnesses in the current probe include a former Mozambican
official with close ties to President Machel; a former South
African military operative; and a former security branch captain at
Komatipoort who was among the first people at the scene of the
accident, Green said. Names were not released because of fears for
their safety, officials said.

The wonders of Melons. The Jordanian truck loads of melons that

<TEXT>
were waiting onthe border to go into Lebanon have been turned back,
after more than two weeks.
	   Three refrigerated trucks were not allowed entry into Lebanon
because it was arguedthat they were violating the Jordan-Lebanese
Trade Protocol. Officials at theAgricultural Marketing Corp are
trying to playdown the incident and have since saidthat the melons
are in a good condition and are being sold at the local market.
Theypointed out that press reports that 50 percent of the melons
have been spoilt wassimply not true.

PADIBERAS Nasional Bhd will enlarge its earnings base by trading

<TEXT>
in foods other than rice to reduce its current dependence on the
import trade in rice, managing director Mohd Ibrahim Nohd Nor said
yesterday.
	   Bernas is studying last year's national food import bill and in
three months, will be in a better position to decide on what foods
to trade in.
	   Mohd Ibrahim said Bernas' plantation venture in Sarawak, BM
Agrotech Sdn Bhd, expected to market its large-scale rice farming
technology to Asian countries within three to five years.
	   Encouraged by the establishment of BM Agrotech, Bernas plans to
enter into more partnerships with local and international players
in the rice industry to develop the industry further.
	   ``We think this is a very necessary step to take in view of the
need to integrate the padi and rice industry.
	   ``In the long term, it is a vital step in order to face the
increasing globalisation of world food trade,'' Mohd Ibrahim said
after the company's annual meeting in Petaling Jaya.
	   On its plans to trade in foods other than rice, he said the move
would allow Bernas to enlarge its business and earnings base by
drawing upon its current and future networks in both local and
international food trade.
	   ``Given the current economic problems and the possibility of a
longer-than-expected recovery, it has become imperative for Bernas
to offer both farmers and consumers an alternative to the current
food trading system.''
	   On BM Agrotech, he said Bernas had invested RM15 million in the
company's activities in developing large-scale rice farming
technology with the help of an American expert, Jerry Lee Bogard.
	   Hailing from Arkansas, Bogard is an expert and practitioner in
large-scale rice farming which utilises spohisticated rice farming
technology for commercial purposes.
	   BM Agrotech hopes to market its technology to Asian countries
such as China and to local farmers.
	   Under a new restructuring exercise, Bernas will own 51 per cent
of BM Agrotech; Marditech Corp Sdn Bhd 39 per cent while the
remaining 10 per cent will be held by Bogard.
	   Bernas recorded a reduced pre-tax profit of RM38.66 million last
year on a record turnover of RM1.3 billion.

AMMAN IS divided into two parts, east and west. The western part

<TEXT>
means richneighborhoods, grand villas, wide and clean streets as
well as different cultural centers.
	   In the eastern side of the capital the situation is a lot
different. There are poor districts,unorganized buildings crowded
streets, and nowhere to spend your free time.
	   However the eastern side of the city is rich with ancient
culture. The downtown forexample is enthused with relics of the
past like the Roman Theater, the great AlHusseini Mosque and the
Ras Al Ein area.Since 1995, the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM)
has set upon developing theneglected spaces. ``We want to bring
life back to these areas'' said GAM's Mayor DrMamdouh Al Abadi,
during a tour for journalists to the different parts of Ras Al
Einproject which is spaced out on 140 dunums.The executed parts of
the plan had been inaugurated by His Majesty King Hussein,they
include: The City Hall building which was opened to the public in
November 1996on the occasion of His Majesty's birthday.The design
of the building reflects the architectural heritage of the area.
The richlydecorated JD 3 million hall has different galleries and
also houses the administrativesection of AGM that is surrounded by
huge palm trees.But connected to the City Hall by a bridge is
another great edifice, a large building forthe rest of the
employees of the Greater Amman Municipality. It costs JD 6
million.The construction of the GAM complex in Ras Al Ein has
greatly contributed to thecultural rejuvenation of east Amman.
Above all, it has provided an opportunity for thepeople to spend
their time in what is called the ``Fountains Yard,'' in that it
includes 19water fountains amidst wide green areas.''We have tried
to keep to the identity of the area, since Ras Al Ein (source of
water inArabic) was a well-known and a rich place for the supply of
water,'' Dr Abadi added.
	   During the celebration of the 52 anniversary of Independence
Day, King Hussein laidthe cornerstone to the up and coming parts of
the project. A mosque, named AlNoorayn and designed according to
Islamic architecture, will be built and will have acapacity for
2000 people.'' This will be coupled with building the Ras Al Ein
Cultural Center that will providecultural and educational services.
Such a center will have a public library, galleries, alarge
auditorium in addition to the other services which include
bookshops, and a carpark.
	   Finally, a national museum will be established to display
antiquities of the Kingdom.

Nuclear powers seek common ground to defuse South Asian fears
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with meeting started.  
  With Albright-India-Pakistan, India-Nuclear  
  AP Photos GEV101-3,6,7  
  By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
rushed into emergency session Thursday aiming to end the South
Asian arms race set off by Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   ``I am convinced this meeting will succeed,'' Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan, the meeting's chairman, said in a brief
opening statement.
	   ``It is essential to create a situation to prevent nuclear
weapons from spreading,'' Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
told reporters before the meeting.
	   ``It is also of great value for us to achieve consensus on the
settlement of issues between Pakistan and India,'' Primakov said in
signaling what aides have been working on in hours of negotiations
before the meeting _ a communique that would offer mediation
services to resolve problems.
	   A U.S. official said the document would also emphasize the
urgent need for India and Pakistan to rejoin the global
arms-control movement.
	   Tang said the five countries share ``a lot of common ground'' in
trying to contain the South Asian arms race.
	   The five met at a U-shaped table in the ornate council chamber
of the United Nations' European headquarters, where negotiators in
1996 thrashed out the global ban on nuclear weapons tests. Despite
bright sunlight, they sat behind drawn curtains.
	   Tang sat at the bottom of the U, with British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on his left
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Primakov on his
right.
	   The five looked upbeat and greeted each other warmly as they
arrived.
	   The foreign minister of another major country in the region,
Kamal Kharrazi of Iran, who coincidentally was also in Geneva,
appeared to support the general thrust of the session.
	   After visiting India and Pakistan, Kharrazi told disarmament
negotiators from 61 countries Thursday the ``lack of serious
intention'' by the five powers had contributed to the arms race.
	   But he said he preferred ``to concentrate on the positive'' and
backed efforts to defuse the tensions between Iran's neighbors.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   He said he didn't plan to meet with any of the five.
	   Albright, who pushed for the meeting, met at length separately
with Primakov and Tang before the joint session.
	   She was mainly concerned with keeping the traditional Russian
tilt toward India and Chinese support for Pakistan from preventing
the five powers producing a strong joint statement, U.S. officials
said.
	   The United States is the only country among the five to impose
sanctions on both India and Pakistan. Albright said she wasn't
pushing for anyone to join.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
said Albright. ``These two countries are cheek-by-jowl.''
	   As he sent Albright from Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton
promised to work to end the Asian rivals' nuclear competition.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.''
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They are also all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India.
	   Neither India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan nuclear power status without unraveling the
entire complex treaty negotiated in the late 1960s.
	   The ministers were examining other ways of bringing them into
global, step-by-step disarmament efforts, said officials.
	   ``We would like to discuss with our partners a position to put
an end to such experiences,'' a Russian mission spokeswoman said.

ON MAY 7, Graham Freeman was supposed to be with his wife

<TEXT>
celebrating their 23rd wedding anniversary. Instead, as
vice-president of American publishing software maker Adobe Systems
Inc, he was in Malaysia attending to business, which included
spreading the anti-piracy gospel.
	   That day, he was at a function held to announce key findings of
a study on the Southeast Asian software industry. `I have incurred
the wrath of my wife by putting off the celebration to be here in
KL. Looks like I'll have to make it up with a more expensive dinner
and all that,' he says.
	   His remark on the price of placing work before domestic demands
was, of course, Freeman's way of injecting a little levity into a
sombre event.
	   But he was dead serious when talking about the cost of software
piracy. 'I believe if the Southeast Asian piracy rate was equal to
that of the United States, Adobe's income (in the region) would be
three to four times what it is now,' he complains.
	   According to estimates by international industry watchdog
Business Software Alliance (BSA), the software piracy rates of
countries in this region are among the highest in the world. In
1996, 84 per cent of the PC business software used or sold in
Southeast Asia comprised unauthorised copies with a market value of
almost US$600 million (US$1  RM3.80).
	   Malaysia's rate was 80 per cent (See Table 1). In comparison,
the US piracy level is currently 27 per cent. (Adobe Systems is a
BSA member, as are other big players such as Autodesk Inc, Bentley
Systems Inc, Lotus Development Corporation, Microsoft Corporation,
Novell Inc and Symantec Corporation.) BSA commissioned Price
Waterhouse to research the contribution of the packaged software
industry to the Southeast Asian economies. The exercise was
completed last December.
	   BSA president Robert Holleyman singled out two conclusions. One,
the industry is significant - more than previously thought -
throughout the region in terms of jobs and revenue created. And
two, it will become even more significant as governments step up
anti-piracy enforcement.
	   Piracy is without doubt a pivotal issue in the Malaysian
software business (as it is in the rest of the region). One cannot
discuss the industry without mentioning the `P' word.
	   To a significant extent, the success of the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) project rests upon adequate intellectual property
(IP) protection.
	   This is precisely why the government has pledged to become `a
regional leader in IP protection and cyberlaws'.
	   Part of the grand design is to make the MSC a development hub
and export centre for software. The idea is to nurture over the
next 10 years a crop of local software makers who can compete
regionally, if not globally.
	   To do this, it is important to enlist the help of the foreign
software titans. Microsoft instantly comes to mind. While in
Malaysia last March, its chairman and CEO, Bill Gates, re-affirmed
his company's support for the MSC but gave scant details. In a New
Straits Times interview, he had this to say about software piracy,
`You never win the battle. It's an important issue but it's an
issue where the trend is definitely positive.
	   There have been good steps taken in Malaysia but I certainly
wouldn't say that we can relax.' Gates' top guy in Malaysia,
Microsoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd general manager Benedict Lee, expands
on the theme. `If you understand the government's drive to
transform the economy from an industrial one to one based on
information, then you understand that we need to build a new
society that can create software.
	   `But if piracy is prevalent, how are we going to attract our
younger generation into software development? They will think there
is no revenue in it at all.' There are many others observing
closely Malaysia's war against the IP thieves. In its 1998 Foreign
Trade Barriers Report released in April, the US Trade
Representative touched on CD-based digital piracy. While praising
the Malaysian authorities' crackdown, the report points out some
weak spots.
	   `Nevertheless, the presence and frequency of pirated videotapes
and computer software continue to increase, in particular at the
retail level.
	   The effect of Malaysian enforcement efforts would be enhanced
through the resolution of lengthy litigation and frequent court
backlogs, as well as the imposition of more substantial fines
against infringers,' recommends the report.
	   It would be a huge setback for Malaysia if the US government
blacklists the country for copyright violations. In March,
Singapore was staring at such a prospect when a US-based
organisation called the International Intellectual Property
Alliance demanded that Washington respond to an `epidemic of
digital, CD-based piracy' in the island nation.
	   The Singapore government was swift to counter. It increased
raids on dealers of pirated optical discs and tightened laws on
imports of disc manufacturing and duplicating machines. In late
April, a Singapore court fined a local computer dealer nearly US$1
million for software piracy. To underscore the point, the
authorities staged a `show' in May at a stadium parking lot, where
40,000 pirated products were smashed with sledgehammers and a
steamroller.
	   The Malaysian government has rarely taken the flashy route in
protecting IP rights, but there is clearly a political will to do
the right thing.
	   Deputy Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk S
Subramaniam, whose ministry is principally responsible for
combating IP piracy, acknowledges that protection of IP rights is a
`fundamental requirement' for creating a local community of
software developers.
	   According to him, the Ministry received 31 complaints on
software piracy between December 1987 (when the Copyright Act came
into force) and April 1998. As a result, goods worth RM3.3 million
have been seized.
	   When asked if any foreign software houses are holding back from
investing in Malaysia due to piracy, Subramaniam points out that
the government is doing its best to curb the problem. `The industry
knows it.
	   We can't do more than what we are doing based on the
co-operation extended by the copyright owners. Apart from relying
on enforcement, they also have to take civil action. It's a
two-prong approach.' The Deputy Minister's statement lends some
weight to observers' criticism of IP owners' reluctance to drag
pirates to court themselves.
	   Cost and time are definitely deterrent factors. However, it has
been argued that civil action is a more effective alternative than
relying on prosecuting officers who are often bogged down and
ill-equipped.
	   Between 1991 and last October, BSA members have taken legal
action against copyright violators in 47 cases. Microsoft is
noteworthy in that it sometimes goes public with its cases. At
least two computer dealers had to buy space in newspapers to
apologise for preloading unauthorised copies of Microsoft programs
onto the hard disks of PCs.
	   In March, Microsoft Malaysia announced that it had received 81
calls on its hotline reporting companies using illegal copies of
Microsoft software. Of these, 32 cases resulted in legal action
while the rest were being investigated.
	   There are gentler ways to deal with the problem. On April 9, BSA
and the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry launched a
30-day campaign against software piracy. The main thrust of the
campaign is to get companies to come clean about using pirated
software and convert to licensed copies. They were assured that
there would be no raids during the 30 days. The grace period has
ended, with early indications that there is some headway, although
this has not yet been quantified.
	   Ultimately, BSA is banking on people realising that using
pirated software amounts to accepting stolen goods. As Adobe
Systems' Freeman puts it, `All we ask is that customers give the
same respect to IP rights as they do the PC. I have a favourite
analogy for this. You don't buy a car, drive it up to a gas
station, fill it up and drive away without paying for the gas. It's
the same with PCs and software.'

UNITED Engineers (Malaysia) Bhd is in the final stage of

<TEXT>
negotiating with a potential buyer to sell ``part of'' its stake in
Projek Lebuhraya Utara- Selatan Bhd.
	   PLUS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UEM, which operates the
North-South expressway.
	   UEM managing director Datuk Dr Ramli Mohamad said both parties
are close to concluding the deal and the details would probably be
disclosed in a month's time.
	   However, he declined to name the party involved nor disclose the
portion which UEM intends to sell.
	   ``We are still talking on the price and stake. The buyer has to
remain anonymous until the deal is signed and when everything is in
place, we will announce it,'' he added.
	   He was speaking to journalists after UEM's annual meeting in
Petaling Jaya, Selangor, yesterday.
	   It was reported that UEM was proposing to dispose a 20 per cent
stake in PLUS, which would enable the former to raise about RM1.5
billion to repay some debts.
	   Ramli said: ``We are looking in that region (to sell 20 per cent
interest). We are not too rigid. If we (were to) sell 20 per cent,
it is not going to be a significant loss to (UEM) shareholders.''
	   When asked the reason behind disposing part of the stake in what
is considered as the cash cow of UEM, Ramli said: ``We need cash.
We can raise enough money and still retain control.
	   ``If we were to sell something that is worth a lot less, we
would have to sell everything.''
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, UEM's debt at company level
totalled RM2.8 billion, inclusive of a US$109 million offshore
facility. At group level, its total debts were RM11.21 billion,
most of which non-recourse project financing which means the loans
were taken for financing specific projects and were prepaid from
revenues from those projects.
	   Ramli said bankers and lenders had indicated that they would
refinance UEM's loans, if it could repay a certain amount.
	   ``We are working with our bankers and lenders to refinance the
debts.
	   Having done that, the remaining debt will be manageable and our
cashflow will be able to sustain this,'' he added.
	   On the possibility of raising long-term bonds or other forms of
borrowings, Ramli said UEM is currently looking at several
financial instruments to refinance the remaining debt.
	   ``Each (of the instrument) has it advantages, merits and
difficulties.
	   First we have to decide how much we can sustain and then decide
on the instrument.''
	   Meanwhile, UEM chairman Tan Sri Radin Soenarno Al-Haj said PLUS
is unlikely to get the Government's approval to raise its toll
charges for the North-South expressway.
	   ``We don't think we will get it for the time being because the
Government is concerned that (the increment) will burden the road
users,'' he added.
	   There is still some uncertainty with regard to the toll rise as
the Government has yet to give PLUS the go-ahead for this year
while the previous one has also been delayed.
	   It was reported that when the toll increase was delayed in 1996,
PLUS had incurred losses of some RM170 million.
	   According to Ramli, PLUS would not be able to maintain the
``high quality'' of services at the expressway, if the company
could not revise its toll charges.
	   ``We are talking to the Government to overcome the short term
problem and we are open to ideas. This is one dilemma we face.''
	   Ramli said almost 90 per cent of the toll collection were used
to repay bank borrowings.
	   ``We are prepared (to accept) that we are not getting the toll
charges increase this year, but I think we won't be able to sustain
if we don't get it beyond this year,'' he added.

JORDAN FACES many ecological problems. Experts and concerned

<TEXT>
people arebusily searching for solutions to attempt to prevent the
deterioration of the environmentin Jordan.
	   Titled ``A Cry for Nature'' a campaign was launched last
Saturday under the patronageof Her Majesty Queen Noor. This
environmental campaign is organized by the RoyalSociety for the
Conservation of Nature (RSCN), and will last till the end of 1998.
	   ``Because of its location between three continents, Jordan has a
variety of habitats,''said Anis Moasher president of the RSCN, the
first non-governmental organization ofits kind to be established in
the region in 1966.
	   ``In the last 100 years, we lost different species in Jordan,
and we certainly could losemore unless we do something, said Mr
Moasher.
	   Studies carried out by the RSCN, show that more than 20
different kinds of animalshave become extinct. These include the
Arabian Leopard, the Syrian Brown Bear andthe Blue-Necked Ostrich.
If action is not taken quickly many others could face asimilar
fate. Also exotic plants have disappeared as 10 million hectares of
fertile landhave been turned into arid deserts or forests of
cement, similar to what happened inShmeisani and Abdoun. In
addition, most of the rivers have become either polluted ordried up
because of illegal uses.
	   ``Our region contains rare species of plants, that's why 40
years ago, experts cameback to this area looking for a solution
when the wheat crops were affected by astrange disease.'' ``I
believe that without nature, mankind will have no future. That is
why we have toincrease public awareness of nature'' said Mr Chris
Johnson, RSCN director ofconservation.
	   ``Increase in population of Jordan (estimated to be 4.5 percent
in the last 15 years) isconsidered to be one of the highest in the
world.'' Johnson emphasized the necessity forsearching for more
resources to protect the ecosystems in Jordan.''Regardless of all
the familiar benefits of animals and plants, 25 percent of our
medicineis derived from plants which reflect the urgent need for a
loud cry for help,'' Johnsonexplained.
	   A Cry for Nature is a call for everyone. It is a mutual
responsibility between the publicand private sectors, organizations
and individuals.
	   ``It is a team effort, and a joint strategy in which the whole
society participates in,''Johnson concluded.
	   RSCN's mission is to protect wildlife and the natural habitat of
Jordan in order topromote a greater understanding of the
environment.
	   ``The society is currently responsible for six major reserves
covering over 1000 squarekilometers,'' said Dr Khalid Irani,
director general of the RSCN.
	   Breeding endangered species to save them from extinction is one
of the objectives ofthe RSCN. Meanwhile, the society has been able
to raise the Arabian Oryx, Gazelle,Ibex and other species.
	   ``That doesn't mean we have no concerns for our Jordanian
citizens in the protectedareas.'' Mr Irani continued. ``Our goal is
to reach a balance between the needs ofwildlife and the needs of
people through the development of large-scale
conservationprograms.'' Mr Irani pointed out that the purpose of
such programs is to integrateenvironmental protection with the
socio-economic development of society.

Baggio set to move to Inter Milan, team says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Roberto Baggio will almost definitely join
Inter Milan for the next Serie A season, a club spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The 31-year-old striker has yet to sign a contract, and the deal
is not yet official but it could come as early as Friday, the
spokesman told The Associated Press on condition of anonimity.
	   Baggio earned a spot on Italy's World Cup roster with a late
surge for Bologna. Serie A's active career scoring leader finished
the season with 22 goals, fourth-best in the league.
	   At Inter, he would be paired with Brazilian superstar Ronaldo,
who joined the club last summer and helped it win the UEFA Cup and
finish second in the league.
	   Baggio will likely sign a contract for two or three years with
Inter, the spokesman said.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Using cranes, jackhammers and cutting
torches, hundreds of workers searched Thursday through shattered
passenger cars and beneath a collapsed bridge for bodies crushed
and buried when Germany's swiftest train jumped the tracks.
	   At least 100 people died when the lead locomotive of
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 broke loose at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning, leaving behind 12 passenger
cars and a second locomotive that careened off the tracks and
crunched together like an accordion.
	   The weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper reported Thursday that
experts from the federal railroad office found signs that one of
the coaches derailed about six kilometers (3.7 miles) before the
train reached the overpass.
	   The coach was dragged along the rail bed until it came to a
turnout near the overpass where it swung sideways, the newspaper
said.
	   Spokesmen for the emergency teams said they had no information
on the report, and the federal railway office had no comment.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.

Swiss banks win NY approval of merger despite Holocaust claims
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: combines pvs.  

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ New York State banking authorities
Thursday approved the merger of two of Switzerland's largest banks
despite efforts to hold up the fusion pending settlement of
Holocaust claims, Swiss bankers said.
	   The state Banking Department's approval meant that the banks
need only the assent of the U.S. Federal Reserve to create one of
the world's biggest banks, said the Swiss Bankers Association.
	   The association is ``very pleased'' with the decision, said
spokesman Christoph Meyer. He said the association expects Fed
approval and that the merger might even be able to take place this
month as planned.
	   Meyer said the two banks had worked constructively with New York
authorities in recent weeks to satisfy all their concerns, mainly
with how they are handling the claims of the heirs of Nazi victims.
	   The Swiss Federal Competition Commission already has authorized
the link-up between Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corporation.
	   Some attempts have been under way in the United States to block
U.S. approval of the merger until the two banks and the other
largest Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, reach a global settlement with
heirs of Holocaust victims who claim the banks owe them money.
	   The merged bank, to be called United Bank of Switzerland, has
accepted the Swiss conditions and thereby made possible early
completion of the deal in Switzerland, the commission said.
	   In February, shareholders of both banks approved plans to merge.
	   With dlrs 627 billion in assets, the new UBS will be the second
largest bank worldwide behind Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The two banks expect the merger to come into effect in the
coming months. The banks have said they expect to have a group
profit by the year 2002 of 10 to 11 billion francs (dlrs 6.9 to 7.6
billion).
	   The combination is expected to lead to a loss of some 13,000
jobs worldwide. The banks have a combined work force of 56,000.

WE ARE drowning in a cesspool of data. A manager returns from

<TEXT>
his three- day business trip abroad and finds his e-mail swamped
with more than a hundred messages. On his desk, he discovers a
mountain of reports, magazines, faxes, notes and memos, all waiting
to be sifted through. To top it all, his voicemail is a veritable
repository of orders to be carried out and appointments to confirm.
Likewise, a journalist might find himself/herself flooded with
enquiries about articles and interviews yet to be confirmed.
	   Welcome to the Information Age, which is also the age of
information glut: 24-hour television and radio, e-mail, newspapers,
magazines, faxes and the Internet. Every day, information in all
its conceivable form batters us and inundates us with its perceived
importance.
	   Over the years, the expanding arsenal of knowledge and data have
steadily pelted our minds, reducing the average human being's
attention span. Interestingly, the amount of information that we
can acquire every day from the newspapers is more than what an
individual, back in the 18th Century, could ever dream of obtaining
in his entire lifetime.
	   The dilemma that the Information Age presents is significant;
finding the information that you desire is no mean feat. Today,
information lies at the tip of your fingertips, yet, this serves as
a double-edged sword that could trigger a whole chain of events. At
the same time that there are vast resources to tap into, the very
fact that there exists such countless resources serves as a
hindrance as well. This is compounded when you can't find the
information you need fast enough, even after plying through mounds
and mounds of data. Ultimately, you delay taking action on the
information that you have finally gleaned.
	   The reason why one reads an article or writes a memo is to
derive something from these actions. In the business environment,
information mapping presents information so that people can find it
swiftly and act on it just as fast. More specifically named the
Information Mapping Methodology, this way of thinking and
communicating information was the brainstorm of Robert E Horn.
While at Harvard and Columbia Universities in the late 60s, Horn
set out to search for answers to information overload and developed
this methodology for the analysis, organisation, and visual
presentation of information.
	   `Information mapping was designed to address the inefficiencies
of written communication,' adds Geoff Webb, managing director of
Mesiniaga-TACTICS Sdn Bhd, the sole distributor of the method for
the Southeast Asian region. It is a process to follow when
developing written communication. It is a method which is both
subject and media independent; it can be applied to any industry
and presented in any form, be it on paper, a computer screen or in
a presentation. Organisations worldwide use information mapping to
develop a wide variety of written material, ranging from internal
memos and reports to proposals, clients, administration manuals,
computer system documentation and online reference information.
	   This efficacious method helps people at all strata of the
corporation to analyse when exactly information is required;
organising and structuring the pertinent information, and finally,
presenting the information as effectively as possible. The
distinctive feature that sets information mapping apart from
mundane methods of communication and gathering information lies in
the fact that it pinpoints what the reader wants to read, as
opposed to what either ardent or inept writers want to express.
	   The state of communications within organisations is far from
super efficient. Companies are swarmed by a plethora of
information, and many have turned to technology to aid matters but
in many cases, technology only worsens the situation. Current
new-fangled technology has failed to produce a paperless office
environment, says Webb.
	   What is required are standards and processes of producing
information, not more technology to render an office environment
paperless, he contends. A paperless office environment is fine if
people manage to work out how to find information effectively
online and on screen. Webb quotes a study on how information
transcribed from paper to screen loses one- third of the former's
efficiency to get the message across. The difficult aspect to put
across about information mapping, according to Webb, is how it aids
information processing in a corporation. Communications in a
business on a day-to-day basis is akin to osmosis in plants: it
just happens, and sometimes, it is so slow that one doesn't notice
it taking place. Internal communications is a fundamental business
process, it is subtle yet corporations spend huge chunks of money
on it, unknowingly, because it involves everyone in the
corporation.
	   A myriad of internal processes are involved and as the wheel of
time spins around its spokes, these processes change and evolve
slowly.
	   Therefore, when communication starts to break down, no one
notices until the situation reaches a point where redress is
unavoidable. `It's like paint peeling off the wall,' says Webb. You
don't see it until a large part of the wall is adorned with strips
of dying paint hanging on for dear life. Information mapping
addresses this subtle business process in the least dramatic way
but that is, nevertheless, big on impact.
	   Information mapping concentrates on dividing and structuring all
relevant information that a person might want to put into blocks,
literally, `chunks' where each block makes sense on its own. It
acts as a stand-alone if taken out of the whole context, and would
be just as effective as getting a salient point across. The reason
for breaking information up into chunks, says Webb, is because the
human mind needs to manage information in small amounts to be
ideally effective. Information mapping gives a user various ways of
designing reusable information to increase efficiency (see graphics
for the difference between a memo which uses information mapping
and one that doesn't). Here's an example of what a difference
information mapping can make: a courier company in Holland adopted
information mapping two years ago, and today, produces its manuals
in half the amount of time that it used to as information that is
pertinent to the manual is retained from previous years, and new
information is conveniently added on.
	   International research has been conducted on the results
achieved from implementing information mapping, according to
Mesiniaga-TACTICS. The results showed decreases in writing
development times which resulted in 30 per cent savings; reductions
in errors and time spent correcting them; decreases in training
times and cost (40 per cent savings), improvements in job
performance, and reductions in number of queries to supervisors,
help desk staff and trainers (70 per cent savings).
	   On the local front, Mesiniaga-TACTICS has worked with several
local corporations in implementing information mapping.
	   The future work environment will be very much
productivity-based, or barring which, a standard for each
corporation to strive for. And in an age where fast decisions and
quick thinking are paramount, the information on which we act had
better be timely and pertinent enough so that precious time isn't
wasted on trying to figure out what's head or tail in a memo.

WALKING AROUND in the metropolitan region I've noticed goats'

<TEXT>
ears which havebeen half cut off (they were ``too long'' the
shepherd boy told me), sheep with filthyundersides and tails,
bleeding sores on donkeys' legs, and emaciated horses pullingsimple
ploughs over rocky land by the highway, but I'd never imagined the
extent towhich rural Jordanians use and depend on animals for their
livelihoods, nor the extentto which the animals often suffer.
	   The Jordanian Society for the Protection of Animals (JSPA) was
formed in 1988 underthe auspices of London's Society for the
Protection of Animals Abroad, whose originsgo back to 1923 with the
creation of the Society for the Protection of Animals in
NorthAfrica (SPANA). JSPA has two animal clinics, one in Wadi Al
Sir and another in DeirAlla in the Jordan Valley, with a total of
15 hard-working, dedicated employees. Irecently visited the Wadi Al
Sir clinic with a group of students from the AmmanBaccalaureate
School.As we climbed down from our bus, a team of vets from JSPA's
Mobile Unit were ontheir way to farms and encampments in the region
to tend animals in need.
	   While the students carried out a number of well-organized tasks
in animal care such aswashing dogs, preparing homemade dog food,
cutting up carrots for the horses anddonkeys, translating brochures
from Arabic into English, and painting cages with brightcolors, I
followed JSPA Vice President Margaret Ledger, Nadia Hamam,
JSPA'sEducation Program's teacher, as well as a vet and his
assistant around as theymulti-tasked in the moderately-sized
clinic.The first patient we met was a stray dog which some people
had cruelly amusedthemselves with by covering with fresh cement.
The vets removed as much of theconcrete as possible, but a great
deal will have to be cut off as the hair grows backover the raw,
irritated skin.One of the vets brought me around to the horse and
donkey stalls. He told me that theylost a donkey yesterday, after
tending it for over 10 hours. Even intravenous fluidscould not save
the creature from death by apparent overwork and dehydration.
	   Several donkeys are presently at the clinic recovering from
serious wounds andsores-some wriggling with maggots-and intestinal
problems.
	   A farmer brought his blind mule to the clinic in order to have
it put down since it hadbecome ``useless.'' The vets applied eye
medicine and antibiotics in an attempt to savethe creature's sight.
I asked a vet the donkey's age. He looked at its teeth: around
16years old. Donkeys can potentially live up to the age of 40.
	   A man phoned the clinic asking for some ointment for his horse's
tail. He was told tobring the animal in. The horse's tail was in an
extreme state of infection. A vet told mehis team spent three hours
ridding the tail of great peels of hair matted with manure,soil,
and maggots.
	   The problems are not always exclusively medical ones.
Occasionally the clinic runs intosome unusual situations. Ledger
told us about a horse that had fallen into a well. Theowners could
not get it out for three days. But the clinic rescued it.
	   At that moment, a grateful farmer came in a truck to pick up his
horse which had beenchewing strangely. The vets found that the
horse had developed sores in its mouth fromeating barley. The
problem was that the animal's teeth needed rasping and it
couldn'tchew properly.''Not all people who use the clinic have
abused their animals. That gentleman, forexample. He noticed that
something was wrong and brought his animal here right away.
	   Many people spot sores on their animals' backs, but are put off
seeking medical advicebecause they need their animals on a daily
basis to plough, haul water, or fortransportation. Before long, the
festering sores, caused by chaffing and poor saddleswhich slip and
slide, become severely ulcerated.'' Many people depend on their
animals to make a living for their large families.JSPA has a Swap
Program, whereby a recuperating work animal is temporarilyreplaced
with one of the clinic's healthy animals.
	   JSPA has an arrangement with the Jordanian Ministry of
Education. Nadia Hamam,who works at the clinic as well as lectures
in 40 government schools in villages up anddown the valley, strives
to teach children how to be humane to animals. A touchingblow-up of
a photograph shows a village school class of 30 children posing
with a dog,''the first dog most of them had ever petted,'' said
Ledger.''Kids need to learn not to cut the ears and tails of stray
dogs and cats, and not tothrow stones at them,'' she said.
	   The irony was that outside the gate of the clinic, at that very
moment, were four villageboys who were taunting some of the dogs
inside, one of the boys waving a stickthreateningly and getting a
thrill when one of the canines barked back and showed
itsfangs.''Forty schools is only a drop of water in the ocean when
you think of the 3,000government schools here in Jordan,'' Ledger
noted.
	   JSPA is not funded in Jordan, although some pharmaceuticals are
donated. ``It is a newpage in the history of JSPA,'' said Ledger.
``We are starting a new campaign in order tobecome better known
within the country. We encourage charity activities which notonly
will raise money but will spread awareness about the humane
treatment ofanimals.'' The clinic desperately needs gas anaesthesia
equipment, drips for curing dehydration,x-ray equipment, and an
electro-cardiograph machine. It also needs to floor and tile
itsoperating theater.''A private citizen graciously held a quiz
night at his home recently, and raised JD 1200.
	   We would love to see school-related fun-raising activities which
would include manyparticipants and be fun,'' Ledger continued.The
JSPA has many affiliations here in Jordan. Ledger is involved with
the HusseinClinic, where disabled children are meeting JSPA's
animal friends. JSPA also has anAdoption Program. We saw a
donkey-originally brought to the Wadi Seir clinic with aserious
case of mange-and her newborn daughter.We watched a vet trim the
back hooves of a horse. He and the veterinary assistant arein
charge of training courses in saddle-making and farriery
(horse-shoeing), with a viewto providing a means of education and
livelihood to unemployed Jordanians.JSPA's cooperation with the
International League for Protection of Horses, the WorldFarriery
Association, and Working Together for Equines led to the founding
of theJordanian Farriers' Association in 1996.
	   ``Farriery is a dying art in Jordan,'' said Ledger. ``You
wouldn't believe how people shoetheir animals-with rubber tires,
with cement reinforcing rod-anything they can find-andwith the
incorrect nails.... these animals are in constant pain. People
think that animalsdon't feel, but you can see the anguish in their
eyes.''

NETWORK security and management software company Network

<TEXT>
Associates believes that the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific
region is a blessing in disguise of sort for the company.
	   Its Asia-Pacific regional channel sales and marketing manager
Bjorn C.
	   Turmann said the situation has caused many companies to put in
additional investment to beef up their network security.
	   This in turn provides Network Associates with more business
opportunities to tap into with its range of security products, he
added.
	   According to Turmann, the company's performance in the region
has been very encouraging, where it recorded more than 50 per cent
quarter-to-quarter growth since October last year with the setting
up of its regional headquarters in Singapore.
	   He said this indicates that Network Associates, by capitalising
on the tremendous business opportunities available, has
significantly built its presence in the region. ``By the end of our
current financial year, we expect to grow between 200 per cent and
300 per cent over that of the previous year.''
	   On its business in Malaysia, Turmann said the company's sales
revenue grew about 150 per cent since October last year, an
achievement that matches its growth in the region.
	   ``Basically, we are growing more than 50 per cent quarterly in
Malaysia.
	   With this kind of growth, we acknowledge that Malaysia is an
important market for us,'' he told Computimes during the company's
Solution Day in Subang Jaya last week.
	   ``For a start, we intend to put a person here to be responsible
for the local market, and if the growth continues to accelerate, we
might consider setting up an office to cater to the market
demand.''
	   Turmann attributed the growth to the company's marketing
strategy, which is to work with local distributors and partners.
	   ``We secured a couple of distributor partners to help us
increase our presence throughout Malaysia.''
	   The partners are First Tech Pacific and Ingram-ER which also
handle the Singapore market.
	   Turmann said the company does not intend to increase the number
of distributors as the present ones are capable in giving enough
coverage for its products.
	   Network Associates' Southeast Asia and Indian sub-continent
territory sales manager Deb Dutta said the company has another
marketing strategy through its Network Associates Partner (NAP)
programme, which was created in response to market requirements.
	   The programme involves a close branded managed channel of
partners who are equipped with technical and sales knowledge to
promote Network Associates' products in the marketplace.
	   Dutta said there are six NAPs in Malaysia, and the plan is to
double the number by end of the year. In order to be a NAP,
resellers need to be able to reach the performing standard that
Network Associates has set.
	   ``It will not be a bureaucratic process as our objective is to
get revenue,'' Dutta said, adding that Network Associates wants to
work well with its NAPs to achieve wider market reach in Malaysia.
	   The company's products which have been well received on the
local front include McAfee Total Antivirus, Sniffer, Gautlett
Firewall, PGB Encryption, McAfee Helpdesk and Cybercop, Dutta said.
	   Network Associates has also introduced a total network solution
called Net Tools. It consists of four suites - McAfee Total Virus
Defence (TVD), PGP Total Network Security (TNS), Sniffer Total
Network Visibility (TNV) and McAfee Total Service Desk (TSD).
	   The Network Associates products are targeted at market segments
such as government, and banking and finance, as well as large
organisations.

THE software industry has long been lobbying for greater

<TEXT>
government protection against intellectual property (IP) theft. In
Southeast Asia, where the piracy rates are alarming, the calls for
help are often rooted in desperation. Bear in mind that this is an
industry dealing with goods that are ridiculously easy to
reproduce.
	   There are many ways to get the undivided attention of the
authorities and the public. Recently, the Business Software
Alliance (BSA) announced the findings of a study to show people
what is in it for them if piracy is lowered.
	   Conducted by Price Waterhouse (PW), the research shows how the
packaged software industry contributes to the economies of
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
	   Packaged software covers business applications and leisure
programs.
	   Examples of business software are operating systems, word
processors, spreadsheets, graphics, database management,
computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering products, and
networking software. Leisure programs include games, entertainment
and educational software. The study excludes customised software.
	   Piracy is defined as `unauthorised copying and distribution of
copyrighted software products'.
	   The BSA-PW report on the study offers persuasive arguments as to
why everybody (except maybe, the pirates) are better off without
software piracy, described as a `major drag' on the industry's
growth. Using 1996 figures, the report argues that the industry is
significant in terms of jobs and the government revenue it has
created. This is followed with projected corresponding figures
until the year 2001. The final part discusses the impact of piracy
and how it would be if the piracy rate was lower.
	   According to the report, the Malaysian packaged software
industry accounted for US$298 million (US$1  RM3.80) in sales and
US$544.5 million in
total economic activity in 1996. That year, it provided 3,656 jobs
in software and supporting industries, and generated US$78.5
million in direct and indirect taxes.	   Between 1996 and 2001, the industry is expected to grow at an
average annual rate of 17.4 per cent, resulting in sales of
US$664.6 million and stimulating US$1.2 billion in economic
activity by 2001. These sales will create 5,548 jobs. The
government is projected to collect US$175 million from this
expansion.
	   What happens if the Malaysian piracy rate - 80 per cent in 1996
-falls to the current US rate of 27 per cent? This leads to the
most compelling and interesting segment of the study.
	   (The folks at BSA will tell you that the only acceptable piracy
rate is zero per cent, but PW picks the US rate as a realistic and
practical point of reference.) If Malaysia's piracy rate in 1996
was 27 per cent instead of 80, there would have been an additional
4,007 jobs and the government would have been richer by US$86
million. By the year 2001, the packaged software industry could
account for 11,628 jobs and US$366.8 million in tax revenues.
	   Says the report, `In sum, software piracy harms the Malaysian
economy, curtails economic growth, constrains employment and limits
tax contributions to the government.'

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian officials pulled out
of talks with the Serbian government Thursday, demanding a halt to
the fierce offensive that has devastated villages and sent tens of
thousands fleeing.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, denied that the police and Yugoslav army
assault across a broad swath of western Kosovo is a strike at
civilians, describing it as a protective sweep against separatist
guerrillas.
	   ``All our actions are defensive in character,'' insisted Veljko
Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo. ``We are
simply responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   The ethnic Albanians say dozens of villagers have been killed
and tens of thousands of people are hiding in forests in the
independence-minded province of southern Serbia, waiting for a
chance to escape to Albania.
	   An estimated 12,000 people already have crossed into that
neighboring country, the Albanian Interior Ministry said.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, the other republic left in what remains of
Yugoslavia besides Serbia, Montenegrin officials said.
	   The Albanian government, worried about both the crush of
refugees and a new threat for its strapped military in Europe's
poorest country, is pushing for Western troops to shore up its
northern border _ a request NATO is considering warily.
	   ``We except everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano, said in
the Albanian capital Tirana.
	   The Serbs' latest crackdown on the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
advocates independence for the predominantly ethnic Albanian
province, prompted the Kosovo Albanians to scrap Friday's next
scheduled round of talks with Belgrade government officials.
	   ``The escalation of force against Albanian civilians is in
contradiction with the spirit of the talks,'' Fehmi Agani, a member
of the Albanian negotiating team, told The Associated Press. ``That
makes the continuation of talks impossible.''
	   He added that his side will reopen talks when the use of force
stops, a blockade of sealed-off zones is lifted and Albanian
negotiators are allowed to visit those areas.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center in Kosovo said one man was killed when
a Yugoslav army border patrol fired on an armed group trying to
cross over illegally from Albania.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory.
	   Delegates to Europe's leading security organization, the OSCE,
on Thursday condemned the escalation of violence in Kosovo and
called on both sides in the conflict to exercise maximum restraint.
Meeting in Vienna, they also urged full access to the affected
areas and said Serb security forces were blocking entry to
humanitarian organizations.
	   In response to growing concerns the Serbs are carrying out a
strategy of forced expulsions, Odalovic claimed ethnic Albanians
have ``cleansed entire villages of their Serb populations.''
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for
numerous deadly attacks on Serb police and Serb sympathizers in
what it says is a war for independence from Serb occupiers.
	   There was evidence of the militants' growing popularity in the
provincial capital Pristina on Thursday, when more than 10,000
ethnic Albanians flooded the main street to protest the latest Serb
violence.
	   The crowd, comprised mostly of young people, chanted ``U-C-K'' _
the Albanian-language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army. Some
carried placards reading ``NATO help save Kosovo.''
	   Unlike in the past, there was not a single chant of ``Rugova'' _
indicating declining support for the ethnic Albanians' long-time
leader Ibrahim Rugova, whose pacifist approach has failed to bring
results.
	   Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian politician,
acknowledged that Rugova has no influence over the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which ``does not want to hear of him.''

Albania worries about Serb incursion across border; seeks aid

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top Albanian official sounded a warning
Thursday about the possibility of Serb forces coming across the
border to pursue their offensive against Kosovo rebels.
	   ``We except everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
said Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano.
	   The Albanian government, worried about both the crush of
refugees and a new threat for its strapped military, is pushing for
Western troops to shore up its northern border.
	   ``The Serbian soldiers won't stop the violence and the
bloodshed. It's really not logical thinking that the situation is
going to be more calm,'' Prela told The Associated Press.
	   ``The conflict may be extended to Albania. And then it will be
extremely grave. That is the reason that the Albanian government
asked NATO to deploy troops in the north of the country.''
	   Unable to cope with the estimated 12,000 Kosovo refugees who
have arrived so far, Nano also has asked NATO for humanitarian aid.
	   ``Our possibilities for facing the new situation in the north
are limited, when the number of arrivals is increasing
dramatically,'' he said in a letter sent to NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana late Wednesday and released Thursday.
	   Nano urged that NATO provide medicines and food in the north.
	   About 12,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from the Serb offensive in
secessionist Kosovo have arrived since last weekend, Interior
Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhja said. Thousands of others are
believed to be trying to join them.
	   ``It's time for the international community to work in unison
and to guarantee with force the defense of the innocent people of
Kosovo,'' Nano stressed.
	   ``Collaborating together (with NATO) is the only way to save
human lifes and the peace in Kosovo,'' he told Solana.
	   Albania's Health Ministry, along with the Red Cross and other
humanitarian organizations, sent clothes and food for refugees on
Thursday to Bajram Curri, the border town where most have arrived.
	   The ministry pledged to set up camps in the north for the Kosovo
refugees, and said it would provide for vaccinations against
contagious diseases.

OF THE MANY factors enhancing Sweden's attractiveness to

<TEXT>
potential investors, perhaps the most prominent in recent years is
the country's location. In his introduction to the Invest in Sweden
Report 1997, Prime Minister Goran Persson attributed his country's
rising inward investment flow to its strategic position at the
centre of the Baltic Sea region.
	   `Sweden is very active in facilitating stronger ties with the
countries around the Baltic Sea. From a business perspective, the
dynamism of the region provides great opportunities,' he wrote.
	   `The region has the prerequisites to be one of the fastest
growing economic areas in Europe. The Baltic Sea region in itself
is an attractive, fast-moving market. At the same time, it is a
substantial potential production base for the European market.' The
region comprises Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, northern
Germany, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the western Russian
areas around St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. With the ongoing
integration of eastern and central Europe, the continent's consumer
base will almost double from 370 million people to 700 million.
	   Already the largest economy in Scandinavia, Sweden's position is
improved further because it is located at the crossroads of the
emerging Baltic markets and the European Union. This makes Sweden
an excellent base for regional operations.
	   There are several other reasons why Sweden's stock of inward
foreign direct investment is the fourth largest in the European
Union (EU) in per capita terms. Since 1990, the number of
foreign-owned companies in Sweden has risen from 2,600 to 3,600, a
jump of more than 40 per cent.
	   Political changes, such as joining the EU, is one cause.
Economic decisions play an equally influential role. These include
market liberalisation and doing away with foreign exchange controls
and restrictions on foreign acquisition of Swedish companies.
	   Costs of doing business have dipped as a result of productivity
improvements and a more competitive exchange rate. In addition,
Sweden's corporate income tax rate of 28 per cent is the lowest in
the EU.
	   Sweden's business competitiveness has improved significantly
during the 1990s. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit
index, which measures the relative costs of doing business, it is
30 per cent cheaper to do business in Sweden than in Germany and
about 15 per cent cheaper than in the United Kingdom.
	   The index is based on statistics relating to wages, costs for
expatriate staff, air travel and subsistence, corporate taxes,
perceived corruption levels, office and industrial rents, and road
transport.
	   Sweden's labour productivity increases this decade have been
among the largest among the industrialised nations. Its
productivity growth between 1989 and 1996 exceeded 30 per cent,
compared with Japan (25 per cent), the Netherlands (21 per cent)
and the United States (16 per cent).
	   Another plus point for Sweden is its long tradition of
international business. Some of the more successful Swedish
multinational corporations started global expansion at the turn of
the century.
	   It helps that Sweden has always been a strong proponent of free
trade and of an open exchange between nations. As a small,
export-dependent country, such an outlook is a necessity.
	   Sweden's principal trading partners are the other major western
European economies. Almost 70 per cent of exports go to other EU
countries and to those in Efta (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein
and Iceland). However, the fastest growing markets for Swedish
exports are in eastern Europe, North America and Asia.
	   In 1997, Swedish exports to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland
and Russia increased by 45 per cent. Engineering products account
for about half of Swedish exports, with machinery, electronics and
motor vehicles making up the main categories. Other exports are
forest products, chemicals (including pharmaceuticals) and
minerals.
	   Swedish imports come primarily from other EU countries. Among
the 10 largest source countries, the US is the only non-European.
The main imports are engineering products, chemical products, crude
oil, mineral products, textiles and clothing.
	   However, as Invest in Sweden Agency director-general Kai
Hammerich points out in its 1997 report, business is a question of
people and human relations. `The ``soft'' factors - competence,
confidence and attitudes - are just as important as the ``hard''
factors. We strongly believe that Sweden's management style and
industrial networking, as well as organisational and project
management know-how, constitute a package of assets not only of
value to the Swedish business community but also to foreign
companies investing in Sweden,' he wrote.
	   The `Swedish way' of management is noteworthy as a style that
functions internationally. Compared with people of other cultures,
Swedes tend to dislike hierarchies; they prefer to work in smaller
groups. But at the same time, they are as individualistic as the
French or British.
	   According to a recent study by the International Institute for
Management Development, Swedish and American managers are the
world's most respected. This is why Swedish managers are being
increasingly recruited for key executive positions in major foreign
international companies.
	   Among the sectors in which Sweden has gained leading positions
globally are those related to pharmaceuticals, biotechnology,
medical devices, lumber and wood products, exploration and mining,
information technology, call centres, heavy trucks and passenger
cars.
	   Swede Success SWEDEN boasts many factors that make it an
investment magnet. In fact, Sweden ...
	   has seen its stock of inward investment increase by more than
200 per cent during the 1990s. In 1995, it was the world's fifth
largest recipient of foreign direct investment.
	   offers one of the most attractive investment climates in Europe,
according to a survey of US executives.
	   is located in the center of one of Europe's fastest growing
regions, the Baltic Sea region.
	   has a corporate tax rate of only 28 per cent.
	   spends more on RD relative to GDP than any other country and
performs leading-edge work in some of the world's most exciting
research areas.
	   has achieved one of the highest productivity growth rates among
the OECD countries in the 1990s.
	   enjoys lower relative business costs than, for example, Germany,
the UK and the Netherlands.
	   offers competitive costs for highly qualified labour and a
well-educated workforce with excellent language skills.
	   offers management with exceptional international experience.
	   is one of the most deregulated countries in the EU.
	   is at the forefront of global IT development.
	   has probably the world's most liberal market for
telecommunications and is among the cheapest for almost all telecom
services.
	   has fostered transnational groups such as ABB, Aga, Astra, Atlas
Copco, Electrolux, Ericsson, Ikea, Pharmacia  Upjohn, Saab,
Sandvik, SCA, Scania, Skandia, Skanska, Stora, Tetra Laval and
Volvo.

Turkey criticizes U.S. report on Nazi Gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey on Thursday severely criticized a
recent U.S. report which blamed Turkey and other countries which
were neutral in World War II of helping the Nazi war machine.
	   ``Nobody has the right to tarnish the image of our country which
has a World War II history to be proud of,'' said State Minister
Sukru Sina Gurel in a seven-page statement.
	   The report, released earlier this week, said countries like
Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Turkey provided Germany with materials
for weapons and goods during World War II and received millions of
dollars worth of wealth looted from Jews in payment.
	   Turkey is accused of having sold chrome to help the Nazi war
effort.
	   Gurel, who heads a commission investigating alleged Turkish
involvement in the Nazi Gold scandal, said the chrome had been sold
to Germany in 1943, under full British consent.
	   He said the report had failed to obtain documents that showed
that the British were aware of the sale.
	   It was not clear how much chrome Turkey sold until it stopped
the sale on Apr. 20, 1944 under pressure from the United States and
Britain. Turkey declared war on Germany on Feb. 23, 1945.
	   ``It only shows that a more scientific and objective research is
needed to save a country from being kept under unnecessary guilt,''
Gurel said.
	   He added the report also ignored the fact that Turkey saved the
lives of tens of thousands of Jews during that time.
	   ``Turkey comes ahead of countries which during World War II
fulfilled its duties towards the Jews and is far ahead of the
United States, which only accepted 20,000 Jews by imposing a
quota,'' the minister added.
	   A first U.S. government report released in May 1997, accused
Turkey of buying or keeping gold looted by the Nazis.
	   Turkey denied those allegations earlier this year, saying the
dlrs 3.4 million worth of gold transferred to Turkey via Germany in
1943 was Turkish gold deposited in Swiss banks.
	   Another dlrs 400,000 worth of gold, deposited for safekeeping to
the Turkish Central Bank in 1945 by the German Embassy which was
closed down at the time, was returned to Germany in 1960, Turkey
said.

DELL Computer Corp has enhanced its Asia-Pacific Web site
(www.dell.com/ap/) with the aim of providing its customers and
visitors with increased resources and greater convenience.
The new features, which are in line with Dell's goal to achieve

<TEXT>
50 per cent of sales online by the year 2000, provide customers
with online access to their order status and information depending
on individual preferences.
	   ``A great site just got better,'' said Dell's Asia-Pacific
president Phillip E. Kelly.
	   He said the improvements made to the Web site enable any visitor
or shopper to get exactly what they need quickly and efficiently.
	   Dell made the changes based on usability research conducted over
the past year in conjunction with customers. ``We want to have one
of the most user-friendly Web sites and online stores in the
industry,'' Kelly said.
	   Among the shopping and customer support improvements are faster
navigation with fewer clicks needed for visitors to get where they
want to go, clear product presentation with new side-by-side
comparison pages display, and product specification sheets in an
attractive format.
	   Customers can also follow their orders through Dell's
build-to-order model from the time the order is taken. The company
also offers OrderWatch, an electronic mail (e-mail) service that
alerts customers the moment their orders have been shipped.
	   Dell said most of the site pages have been optimised to speed
download time to an average of 10 seconds per page. A new
navigation structure enables customers to troubleshoot their
systems, review general support services like frequently asked
questions, the file library and communicate with technical support
staff via e-mail.
	   Another feature, Dell Channel, utilises Channel Definition
Format (CDF), the proposed push technology standard proposed by
Microsoft Corp, and dynamic HTML to cut down browsing time and
bring important news from the company to customers at their
desktops.
	   With the Web site, Dell is offering visitors an opportunity to
win their own custom-figured Pentium II-based computer system. The
contest is open to residents of Malaysia, Australia, Brunei, Hong
Kong, Korea, Macau, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
Entries have be submitted over the Internet and received by Dell by
June 11.

Step 1: Decide whether you have a misunderstanding or a true

<TEXT>
disagreement Suppose you're having trouble with your sister. She
refuses to listen to you. Is the answer for her to take an extended
education course in effec- tive listening?
	   To answer that question, you've got to determine what type of
problem you're facing - a misunderstanding or a true disagreement,
which would persist no matter how well you understand each other.
	   To identify the type of problem, ask yourself, `Would the
problem disappear if we understood each other better?' Suppose that
your sister refuses to lis ten to you because you are communicating
with her openly and honestly, of fering such helpful advice as:
`You're always talking on the phone about your problems. Have you
thought about seeing a psychologist?' And: `Perhaps you wouldn't
have so much trouble with your skin if you wore less makeup.' Would
your relationship with your sister improve if you understood each
other better?
	   Not at all. She understands you all too well. There's no problem
with her listening skills. The problem lies in the content of your
message.
	   There is a true disagreement - and taking a listening course
won't resolve it. When you of fend her again, she's still going to
tune you out.
	   In a true disagreement, what can you do?
	   Step 2: Create the other person's next move Call it male
intuition, but I just knew that Naomi wanted me to propose to her.
I knew because of certain hints that she would drop which were, in
terms of size, comparable to a refrigerator.
	   Example: `Hey, David! There's a movie on TV tonight where Billy
Crystal falls in love and gets married. Doesn't that sound
wonderful? In real life, I mean.' Through Naomi's subtle hints,
gradually the point began to sink in that maybe we should get
married. I, on the other hand, did not want to `rush into things'.
However, as the months went by, Naomi, as you might expect, was
getting a mite impatient.
	   Fortunately for me, she did not give up. Instead, she broke down
the big decision about getting married into a series of smaller
decisions.
	   She thought to herself, `What steps are involved in deciding to
get married?' Of course, the primary step is to recognise that you
love each other. (We had done that.) But there were still lots of
practical decisions for me to make with her. I'd have to decide
with her whether to have kids, and if so, how many. I'd have to
decide with her where we were going to settle down and whether we
were going to rent or buy a home.
	   Noami reasoned, `After he dispenses with all the practical
issues, the only remaining step will be to propose.' So over the
next few weeks, Noami brought up one topic at a time. She'd muse
over dinner, `l realise that you haven't proposed yet,' (she'd
preface all her musings by saying this) `but where do you think we
should settle down?' We'd talk about that. Then a few days later,
she'd mention, `l realise you haven't proposed yet, but do you
think we should rent, or buy?' Before I knew it, we'd begun
planning the wedding. But now, instead of seeming like a step into
the great abyss, marriage seemed like a natural progression from a
series of decisions I had already made - about the person,
lifestyle, and values. Pretty soon it be came almost comical that
we had worked everything out, yet I hadn't proposed. So I proposed.
	   Step 3 Use their own perceptions to convince them It is easy in
the stress of an argument to lose sight of the other person's
perspective. But their thinking is precisely what can make it a lot
easier for you to patch things up.
	   Soon after Noami and I met, we had a big fight and neither of us
was sure the relationship was going to last. She suggested getting
together for a walk on the beach. She told me later that she had
come to the beach thinking, `This is probably the end. He doesn't
care about me.' But I figured she was also thinking, `I want this
relationship to last - if he shows me that he cares about me.' I
wanted to build on the perception of hers. So I did something that
was, well, hardly original. I showed up with a rose.
	   But then, originality isn't what counts; it's the result that
matters.
	   The result was a scene from Hallmark. She threw her arms around
me and we began crying - which made us both determined to work
things out because we cared so much about each other.
	   When you're having trouble with someone, ask yourself, `What are
they thinking - and how can I build on it?' Fresh out of college, I
was having trouble getting a job. Nobody wanted to hire me. Then I
stopped to consider the perceptions of a typical company. Why
should they hire me? I was too young to know anything. But because
I knew what they were thinking, I could do something about it.
	   I shaved off my beard, went to a men's store, and brought the
most conservative suit I could find.
	   Because, as silly as it sounds, a lot of us think, `Person in
suit! This individual must have something important to say!' I had
a job within two weeks.
	   Step 4: Predict the other person's response I called my local
newspaper to find out how long my classified ad was supposed to
keep running. The clerk sounded grumpy. I gave her my phone number
so she could find my account on the computer. No luck.
	   She said condescendingly, `Well, you can't expect us to find
your ad if you can't even give us the right phone number.' I felt
like saying, `l guess I'll have to call back when there's a
competent person available!' Fortunately, I remembered what I teach
my students: When the other per- son says something, don't say
something right back. Pause. And in that pause, do two things: 1.
Don't say anything.
	   2. Ask yourself, `If I say what I'm planning to say, how will
this person respond?' I knew that if I insulted her, I'd lose any
hope of getting her help. I had to break the negative cycle. So I
apologised. `l'm sorry this is turning out to be a nuisance. I
didn't mean to cause you trouble.' She explained, `lt's just kind
of hard to find your ad, you know, unless we have the correct phone
number.' Her voice was softening.
	   I said, `Yes, I understand.' Then she brightened, `Tell me this,
do you know when the ad began run- ning?' Before I knew it, she was
of fering to go through their library of newspapers to find my ad,
because the closing date would be printed in it.
	   In a few minutes, she went from in sulting me to helping me.
	   Begin using strategic communication one step at a time. At
first, go into the conversation asking your self, `Would the
problem disappear if we understood each other better?' Then add the
second strategic step, and so on.
	   The goal is to train yourself to ap ply the four strategic steps
spontane ously - thus avoiding conversations where talking makes
things worse.
	   What if they use this method, too?
	   You should be lucky. I hope that you are fortunate enough to
deal with someone who is thinking constructively about how to solve
the problem with you. All too often, the other person is not.
	   They are consumed by their own emotions and lashing out, at
times trying to control or trick you.
	   How can you succeed if the other person is also using strategic
commu-nication? The answer is: Much more easily. If you are both
systematically focused on working things out, you'll make progress
faster. -UPS This is the first of a five-part series on
communication for managers.
	   WHICH WILL HELP YOU MORE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM Listen and explain,
and any problem can be solved.
	   Decide what you should do to get what you want.
	   Explain why they are wrong and refute their beliefs.
	   Once you figure out what to do, just do it! STRATEGIC
COMMUNICATION Decide whether you have a misunderstanding or a true
disagreement.
	   Create the other person's next move.
	   Use their own perceptions to convince them.
	   Predict the other person's response.

Bank of England surprises markets with interest rate increase
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: AMs version; inserts closing stock values, rise by British
pound, EDITING to tighten  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hoping to bring inflation under control, the Bank
of England raised interest rates by a quarter-point Thursday,
jolting markets and angering troubled manufacturers who worry their
businesses will suffer further.
	   The central bank raised its repo rate, the lowest rate at which
it loans money to commercial banks, to 7.50 percent from 7.25
percent.
	   Investors were stunned, since experts had said Britain's economy
was slowing down on its own as exporters have been hit hard by the
high value of the British pound.
	   But the central bank said wages were rising too fast and that
consumers are spending too much to keep inflation down.
	   Stock prices fell, the British pound rose, homeowners braced for
higher mortgage payments and corporate leaders said the move would
make it even more expensive to do business in Britain.
	   At the British Chambers of Commerce, deputy director Ian Peters
lamented ``a rate rise too far.''
	   ``Recent forecasts have suggested that the U.K. economy was set
for a soft landing,'' Peters said. ``Today's decision will mean
that many businesses will now face a rougher ride, and it increases
the serious problems facing our exporters.''
	   The interest rate increase was the sixth since the Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair took office in May 1997,
and is intended to let Labor finally hit its target for inflation.
	   Inflation hit a six-year high of 4 percent in April, well above
the target of 2.5 percent that the government has missed in 10 of
the past 11 months.
	   Alarmed investors pushed share prices sharply lower within
moments of the announcement as the pound soared on foreign exchange
markets.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell by about 1.3 percent, but it regained more than half that
ground by the end of trading, closing with a loss of 37.6 points,
or 0.6 percent, at 5,860.8.
	   The pound jumped to dlrs 1.6462 from dlrs 1.6364 late Wednesday
and to 2.9137 German marks from 2.8914 marks.
	   Britain's top Treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown, shook up the nation's monetary structure almost
immediately after taking office last year when he gave the Bank of
England power to set interest rates on its own. His political foes
have been critical ever since.
	   Previously, British chancellors had set rates and, although the
decisions on monetary policy are now out of the hands of
politicians, the opposition has always been quick to make politics
out of each rate increase.
	   At the Liberal Democrat party, Britain's third largest, lawmaker
Edward Davey accused Brown of creating ``the Jekyll and Hyde
economy _ a booming consumer sector and a busting manufacturing
sector.''

ONE YEAR passed since the government started to liberalize

<TEXT>
consumer goods' prices,a step that is seen as inevitable to prepare
the country for the era of globalization.
	   During this year, the Ministry of Supply started lifting subsidy
on strategic foodstuffitems such as rice, sugar, powdered milk and
wheat, and therefore allowed the privatesector to import these
goods. This step is seen as one that would boost competitionamong
merchants and provide a greater variety of goods at competitive
prices.
	   However, since it was implemented, the philosophy behind price
flotation has beenhammered by many critics who warned that it would
lead to more price hikes at thecost of the consumers.
	   Of course, merchants and some economic experts applauded this
policy and pointedout that it will give the private sector a more
active role and enhances competitionamong importers.
	   Today some people are surprised. They say that goods and
commodities have actuallydropped, if not staying the
same.Nonetheless, they still call for a tougher supervision from
the government to stop anymonopolistic practices of various
merchants.These greedy importers seek to dominate the market by
swallowing the smaller oneswho are still unable to operate
individually and/or according to certain mechanisms.
	   What this actually means is that the flotation philosophy
continues to be at the core ofthe dispute among the three parties
concerned in the sell and buying process: themerchant, consumer and
the government.
	   ``We feel that the prices of basic food items such as rice and
sugar, have remarkablydropped because of competition,'' says Abu
Osama, an owner of a supermarket inAmman.
	   He adds that this is attributed to the decline in their prices
on international markets.
	   One ton of sugar declined within a year, from $400 to $320, and
also a ton of Egyptianrice fell from $440 to $360. ``This was
positively reflected on the domestic prices, as aton of sugar was
sold at JD 260 compared with JD 320 before the liberalization
waslaunched, he elaborates.
	   Another merchant who has just bought numerous bags of rice says,
``today we buy aton of rice at JD 320, whereas it was JD 380.''
``We as consumers noticed that this policy has one privilege, it
has mobilized thesituation in the markets, and there is no big
difference in price from one shop toanother,'' Amnah Ayesh tells
The Star. Mrs Ayesh continues to say that now we havechoice to buy
the less expensive commodity. This means that there is a bigger
supply ofdifferent variety of goods. And as a result consumers have
become selective in lookingfor best quality and a cheaper price.
``Maybe you find foodstuffs or vegetables that iscostly at one of
the shops in downtown Amman, but certainly it is less expensive
inother areas or even if we buy them from sellers who sell in
wholesale,'' she adds.
	   The irony is that many consumers do not hide their surprise
about the results of theprice liberalization. Though one year is
not enough time to evaluate its successconsumers on the whole are
satisfied with the prices.But there are discrepancies. The National
Society for Consumer Protection (NSCP) ina recent study revealed
that prices of commodities increase by 20 percent within ayear.
	   This naturally means more burdens shouldered by consumers. The
study says that thesole beneficiary from the liberalization program
is the merchant who is free to raiseprices and monopolize the
market in the absence of tough supervision from thegovernmentFew
days ago, the Ministry of Supply decided to cut prices of cereals
from thewarehouses as from 1st June between 4.5% and 25% excluding
wheat. The measure istaken in response to the decline in their
prices on international markets. The cuts applyto sugar, Chinese
rice, American rice, barley and fodder.
	   By applying these reductions, the prices offered by the Ministry
become equal to thosefixed by merchants and private sector
distributors.
	   For instance, the price of Chinese rice has been cut by 20%, as
one ton would be soldat JD 250 compared with JD 300. Also a ton of
American rice would be sold at JD340 against JD 360, a fall of
5.8%. Could this carry good news for consumers andpave the way for
more price declines instead of hikes? Nobody knows.
	   A recent field study conducted on vegetable prices showed that
they fell by 1.5 percentlast month compared with the same month
last year. In addition the price of chicken,meat and water melons
recorded a satisfactory drop.

STOP by any computer store, and you'll see a great number of new

<TEXT>
3-D boards that now come with OpenGL drivers.
	   The industry support began in the first half of 1997, when eight
computer heavyweights, including Intel and Compaq, licensed OpenGL
3-D technology, a more established 3-D API standard developed by
workstation maker Silicon Graphics for high-end computer-aided
design (CAD) and 3-D modelling applications.
	   The move is expected to bring a 3-D technology previously
confined mostly to powerful workstation computers into the
mainstream personal computer (PC) market.
	   A standard API such as Microsoft's Direct3D, released in
mid-1996, lets programmers implement 3-D effects universally.
Unfortunately, many developers complained how difficult it was to
do sophisticated 3-D graphics programming with Direct3D.
	   Renowned game companies such as id Software, developer of the
compelling 3-D game Quake, are designing exclusively for OpenGL.
	   Frustrated by Direct3D's poor ability to create fantastic 3-D
effects, an increasing number of 3-D software developers started to
use more OpenGL last year. Also, Silicon Graphics is licensing
OpenGL to most hardware makers.
	   In response, Microsoft licensed OpenGL for use in its OSR2
release of Windows 95. Microsoft also announced a new version of
the professional 3-D graphics API, OpenGL 1.1, for Windows NT and
95. OpenGL 1.1 incorporates an enhanced rendering pipeline, which

Black Sea forum leaders gather in Yalta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Leaders from the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation forum began gathering at a seaside resort Thursday for
a summit meant to formally turn the 11-nation group into a regional
economic organization.
	   The summit in Yalta began with a meeting of senior officials
from member countries. Later, meetings were planned among foreign
ministers and between heads of state.
	   On Friday, leaders of BSCE countries plan to sign the group's
charter and a joint declaration which, according to Ukrainian
officials, would state their determination to promote peace and
stability in the region.
	   ``The primary goal of the summit is the creation of a new
international organization ... for economic cooperation,'' said
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk.
	   The European Union sent a message to the summit saying it looked
forward to expanding cooperation with BSEC and provide practical
support to it, the British Embassy in Kiev reported.
	   The BSEC, set up in 1992 to promote regional cooperation and
economic projects, includes Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria,
Greece, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.
	   Participants in the summit are expected to discuss transport
routes and environmental problems of the heavily polluted Black
Sea, although Ukrainian officials say no formal agreements are
planned.
	   They also are expected to focus on the transportation of Caspian
Sea oil from huge deposits in Azerbaijan. Ukraine is pushing for
some of the oil to be carried by tankers to a terminal at the Black
Sea port of Odessa and then on to Europe.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma held a series of bilateral
meetings Thursday, including those with Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov, Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi and Romanian President
Emil Constaninescu.
	   Kuchma and Constantinescu decided to set up a special council to
deal with bilateral cooperation, Kuchma's press service said.

World Cup: death threats behind, substitute could be a starter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Victor Hugo Aristizabal, whose
inclusion in Colombia's World Cup roster prompted death threats,
has won over his critics and seems on his way to a starter
position.
	   Aristizabal, who plays for Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Colombia coach
Hernan Dario Gomez received phoned death threats after the
striker's name appeared on the list of players to go to France.
	   Colombian players and officials have feared death threats since
defender Andres Escobar was slain at his home town of Medellin days
after his own goal against the United States put Colombia out of
the 1994 World Cup.
	   Some of Colombia's volatile fans don't think Aristizabal is
among the country's best players. Gomez has gotten mixed reviews
for his coaching.
	   Aristizabal, however, made a great impression against Germany
and Belgium, the two most recent rivals of Colombia. Germany won
3-1 and Belgium 2-0, but Aristizabal, who entered both games with
his team already losing, played well as a substitute.
	   ``Undoubtedly, the team improved with Aristizabal. He is a
modern player, who helps in midfield and supports the strikers,''
Gomez said.
	   ``He has good skills, change of pace, helps Harold Lozano in
midfield, closes spaces... He is a key player.''
	   Aristizabal has always played as a striker in the national team,
but Gomez is using him as an offensive midfielder.
	   The results have been very satisfactory and Aristizabal seems
now ready to replace Freddy Rincon as the partner of Carlos
Valderrama in midfield.
	   Gomez has said he has a surprise in his lineup and those
familiar with the team situation believe he intends to confirm
Aristizabal as a starter.
	   The player has the support not only of Gomez but also of
Faustino Asprilla, the star forward from Italy's Parma. Asprilla
has played with Aristizabal in Atletico Nacional and has always
considered him his ideal partner in the attack.

Nuclear powers seek common ground to defuse South Asian fears

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
rushed into emergency session Thursday aimed at curbing the South
Asian arms race prompted by recent nuclear testing from neighboring
rivals India and Pakistan.
	   ``I am convinced this meeting will succeed,'' Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan, the meeting's chairman, said in a brief
opening statement.
	   ``It is essential to create a situation to prevent nuclear
weapons from spreading,'' Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
told reporters before the meeting. ``It is also of great value for
us to achieve consensus on the settlement of issues between
Pakistan and India.''
	   A U.S. official said a joint communique that would offer
mediation services would also emphasize the urgent need for India
and Pakistan to rejoin the global arms-control movement.
	   Tang said the five countries share ``a lot of common ground'' in
trying to contain the South Asian arms race.
	   The five met at the United Nations' European headquarters, where
negotiators in 1996 thrashed out the global ban on nuclear weapons
tests. The ministers looked upbeat and greeted one another warmly
as they arrived.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who coincidentally was
also in Geneva, appeared to support the general thrust of the
session.
	   After visiting India and Pakistan, Kharrazi told disarmament
negotiators from 61 countries Thursday the ``lack of serious
intention'' by the five powers had contributed to the arms race.
	   But he said he preferred ``to concentrate on the positive'' and
backed efforts to defuse the tensions between Iran's neighbors.
	   ``The nuclear sword of Damocles is now hanging over the region
by a slender thread,'' Kharrazi told the Conference on Disarmament.
	   He said he didn't plan to meet with any of the ministers of the
five major countries.
	   Albright, who pushed for the meeting, met separately with
Primakov and Tang before the joint session. She was mainly
concerned with keeping the traditional Russian tilt toward India
and Chinese support for Pakistan from preventing the five powers
producing a strong joint statement, U.S. officials said.
	   The United States is the only country among the five to impose
sanctions on both India and Pakistan. Albright said she wasn't
pushing for anyone to join.
	   The South Asian arms race is ``a uniquely dangerous situation,''
said Albright. ``These two countries are cheek by jowl.''
	   As he sent Albright from Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton
promised to work to end the Asian rivals' nuclear competition.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.''
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They are also all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India. Neither
India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Arms control experts in Geneva said it is impossible to give
India and Pakistan nuclear power status without unraveling the
entire complex treaty negotiated in the late 1960s.
	   The ministers were examining other ways of bringing them into
global, step-by-step disarmament efforts, said officials.
	   ``We would like to discuss with our partners a position to put
an end to such experiences,'' a Russian mission spokeswoman said.

Marco Pantani powers up hills to win stage and retain lead
</HEADLINE>
  EDs: UPDATES with more quotes, times; minor editing

<TEXT>
	   PLAN DI MONTECAMPIONE, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani powered his
way up grueling mountain passes Thursday to clinch the 19th stage
of the Tour of Italy and increase his lead over rival Pavel Tonkov.
	   The 239-kilometer (148 mile) ride, under scorching sun, took its
toll on race favorite Alex Zuelle of Switzerland, who lost dozens
of positions after dominating the initial stages of this cycling
classic. Zuelle sits a whopping 32 minutes behind Pantani, the
overall leader.
	   Pantani, who captured the leader's pink jersey for the first
time in his career Tuesday, now holds a one-minute, 28-second lead
over Russia's Tonkov with three days to go.
	   The 1996 Giro winner, Tonkov is stronger than Pantani in the
time trials and could catch the Italian in the final time trial
Saturday.
	   ``I knew it was my last chance to make up time,'' said Pantani,
a climbing specialist. ``I tried my hardest and now we will see if
it was enough.''
	   The 22-stage Giro ends Sunday in Milan.
	   ``Marco was in great shape and I was, too, until the last
kilometers,'' Tonkov said. ``Then I had a small breakdown because
of so much sun and heat.''
	   The two rode side by side for much of the stage's final climb
through the Alps until about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the
finish line when Pantani broke away.
	   ``Victory is going to come down to seconds in the time trial,''
Pantani said. ``It will be very tough for both of us.''
	   The Italian completed Thursday's stage, the longest of the Tour,
in seven hours, 31.26 seconds.
	   Pantani, 28, who was sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a
broken leg, took over the leader's pink jersey from Zuelle during a
mountain stage.
	   ``It is always difficult to be the favorite,'' said Zuelle.
``But I never expected to suffer as much as I did today.''
	   Zuelle said he had trouble breathing throughout the stage.
	   The Giro's 20th stage Friday, a mostly flat ride with a few
small hills, takes riders 137 kilometer (85 miles) from Boario
Terme to Mendrisio, Switzerland.

KELANG Container Terminal Bhd (KCT), Malaysia's largest

<TEXT>
container terminal operator, is setting its sights on bigger
things.
	   KCT will emerge as a stronger force to be reckoned with once
plans for its merger with Kelang Port Management Sdn Bhd (KPM)
become a reality. And a deal could be sealed sooner than expected
since both KCT and KPM have a common major shareholder in Kontena
Nasional Bhd.
	   The merger will create a powerful new entity with KCT's 50 per
cent market share of the container terminal business and KPM's 20
per cent market share. KCT will also be involved in a wider range
of businesses.
	   Currently, KCT confines its activities to container terminal
services while KPM's businesses include non-container activities.
The merger will also give the remaining player in Port Klang,
Kelang Multi Terminal Sdn Bhd - the operator of Westport - a run
for its money.
	   KCT managing director and chief executive officer Abdul Samad
Mohamed is coy about the merger. `The facilities operated by KCT
and KPM in the North Port at one point in time formed part of a
single port organisation. In the particular area of container
terminal services, both entities are offering port customers a
similar range of facilities and employ manpower trained in a
similar range of skills,' he says.
	   `In terms of servicing their respective clientele, each company
is an alternative to the other. There have also been opportunities
and the need to work together in a complementary manner, offering
assistance to the other as and when operational needs dictate.
	   `Feedback indicates that customers of both companies share the
same view of perceived advantages that can emanate from a
full-scale merger. The seamless operational environment in a merger
situation offers opportunity for further smoothening of the
interface which, under the present arrangement for operational
collaboration, may still have hiccups to overcome,' he adds.
	   KCT operates four container berths - numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11 -
within the same linear configuration of the berth-line for KPM,
which operates berths 12 to 25. Berths 16 to 21 are designed for
container operations.
	   KPM's shareholders are Kontena Nasional (52.5 per cent),
Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (25 per cent), the
Selangor government (12.5 per cent) and the Pilgrims Fund Board (10
per cent). KCT's major shareholders are Konnas Terminal Kelang Sdn
Bhd (40 per cent), Kelang Port Authority (20 per cent) and the
Employees Provident Fund (6.76 per cent).
	   Abdul Samad says, `The two companies have submitted a joint
proposal to the government to undertake a project to enable
versatility in the usage of berths 12 and 13 which have been
privatised to KPM. This situation can form a very effective
framework around which an actual merger can be developed.' The
proposal involves the revamp of conventional cargo berths 12 and 13
to handle containers as well. This, apart from making economic
sense, will also further support efforts to make Port Klang a
bigger transshipment hub.
	   On KCT's immediate plans, Abdul Samad says, `Our core business
is the provision of container terminal services. Our concerns will
continue to align our range of services in direct response to the
demands of the market to retain existing customers and secure new
ones.' KCT will focus on three major areas: upgrading and improving
facilities and equipment, process reviews - including
re-engineering and upgrading worker skills, and investment in
automation and information technology.
	   This will provide better control and transparency of operations
and enhancing networking with business partners.
	   An analyst says, `KCT's cash rich position is an added
advantage. The company has RM81 million cash in hand and no bank
borrowings as at the end of 1997. This definitely gives it the
leeway to upgrade and fine-tune its operations for better
performance in the current year.' At KCT's recent annual general
meeting, chairman Datuk Rahmat Jamari said the company intends to
spend RM60 million to buy four new quay cranes to replace older
ones. KCT currently operates 12 quay cranes. An additional RM9
million investment will be used to expand the container yard.
	   The expansion of the yard will increase KCT's container handling
capacity from the current 16,000 TEUs (twenty foot equivalent
units) per day to 22,000 TEUs. With the broader container parking
spaces offered by the four berths, yards and back-up areas, KCT can
handle 1.2 million TEUs per year, says Abdul Samad.
	   Results for the financial year ended Dec 31, 1997 indicates that
stiff competition and the economic slowdown in the region have
affected KCT's overall performance. But it is addressing these
problems internally while working out the merger details.
	   For the record, the company's turnover decreased by 1.5 per cent
from RM191.9 million in FY1996 to RM189.1 million in FY1997.
Similarly, pre-tax profit slid 13.7 per cent from RM73.3 million in
FY1996 to RM63.3 million in FY1997.
	   The good news is that KCT has zero gearing and the year-end cash
position improved by 29.7 per cent from RM62.6 million in FY1996 to
RM81.2 million in FY1997. The total dividend payment for the year
is RM17.88 million, indicating a dividend rate of 20 sen per share
(see table 1).
	   At the time of writing, KCT shares were trading at RM2.65,
giving them a historic price earnings multiple of 7.6 times.
Analysts reckon the shares are a good long-term investment given
KCT's dominance in its sector and especially if the merger goes
through.
	   The total container throughput handled by KCT's facilities
increased by 4.88 per cent from 946,788 TEUS in 1996 to 993,010
TEUS in 1997. The volume of import containers excluding
transshipment rose by seven per cent from 440,910 TEUS to 404,324
TEUS during the same period. Transshipment boxes posted a strong
growth, registering a 27 per cent margin of the total volume from
127,984 TEUS in 1996 to 162,498 TEUS in 1997.
	   Abdul Samad says the highest monthly throughput was recorded in
March 1997 when the terminal handled a total volume of 89,194 TEUS.
Although the number of vessels calling at the terminal dropped by
1.6 per cent from 2,503 in 1996 to 2,463 in 1997, the average
number of boxes exchanged per vessel call increased from 378.26
TEUS to 403.17 TEUS.
	   The outlook for the current year seems to be a bit grey. Abdul
Samad says cautiously, `It is obvious that the downturn in our
economy has a direct impact on the scale of container handling
activities at the port.
	   The actual volume will be hard to guess at this point. The
unofficial figure I have reviewed indicates that the total
throughput growth of Port Klang for the first four months this year
is below three per cent. When we analyse the profile of the
container throughput, the 1998 figures include contributions from
transshipment and empty boxes that are far higher in comparison to
the situation in 1997.
	   `This differs greatly from initial projections and the
double-digit growth rate attained for the similar period last year.
If this trend persists throughout the remaining months of the year,
we could see a full-year figure hovering at well below last year's
1.7 million TEUS of containerised trade in Port Klang,' he adds.
	   `Within KCT's sphere of activities, the proportion of indigenous
laden containers from January to April 1998 stood at 65 per cent
against 73 per cent registered in the same period last year. By
extension, the volume of traffic associated with indigenous trade
of imports and exports has weakened.
	   `This weakening can also be attributed to the large number of
public holidays in the earlier months due to the major festivals.
One cannot rule out the possibility of a pick-up in import and
export activities later in the year. The statistics for the next
quarter may suggest a clearer picture and indicate the outlook for
the remaining months of the year,' Abdul Samad says.
	   In terms of direct impact, there has been a reduction in imports
thus reducing the size of overall in-bound traffic that Port Klang
terminal operators are servicing. `The reduced imports has resulted
in an imbalance in the supply of empty containers to support
export. As a result, the trend now is to consciously import empty
containers into Port Klang to support export requirements. The
first three months of the year indicate a sharp rise of in-bound
empty containers through KCT. We believe this trend applies equally
to other terminal operators in the country,' he adds.
	   `KCT has to put on its best effort in going after a business
cake that is showing weaker growth. Of course, there is the
prospect of doing additional business through servicing of
transshipment of third-country boxes. However, the potential for
this depends greatly on the state of the economy of the targeted
countries,' he says.

urgently, Abu Hassan added, is to enhance the competitive edgeof
national industry and make it more qualified. This naturally would
enable it tocontinue growing in the international market, face
competition, follow up on the latesttechnology and explore ways to
guarantee free access to new markets.
	   The ACI's chairman reiterated the need to exempt industrial
inputs from customs tariffs,which is an old demand of
industrialists in Jordan.
	   Attending ceremony was also Minister of Industry and Trade Dr
Hani Al Mulki whostressed that Jordan, thanks to the directions of
His Majesty the King, was able to laya foundation for industry and
give much care to infrastructure, including water,electricity and
telecommunications.This base has expanded to include mineral
industries such as phosphate, cement, andoil, to name but a few.
	   Today, Al Mulki said, there are more than 25,000 industrial
establishments, whichemploy 12 percent of the work force in this
country. These firms contribute about 20percent to the Gross
National Product. Also industrial exports stand for 90 percent
ofthe total national exports, generating JD 900 million in revenues
every year. Jordanianexports reach the markets of 110 countries in
the world.Speaking on behalf of the honoured industrialists from
the private sector, was MrAddul Majeed Shoman, chairman of the
board of the Arab Bank. He said that industryis a main source in
the national economy, supporting it with about JD 3 billion.He
continued to say that the industrial sector contributed in
achieving an additionalvalue which reached JD 10.22 million in 1997
and created more than 14,000 jobopportunities.
	   Industrialists in the Kingdom expressed their appreciation
because of the King's visit tothe chamber , which is the house of
the industrialist, who is keen to give a helping handto this vital
sector that outlines the technological advancement in all economic
sectors inJordan.
	   Sources from the Chamber pointed out that the economy has
entered a new era whichrequires great effort from both the public
and private sectors to maintain the alreadyfulfilled
accomplishments and achieve more success in the long run. The
currentsituation demands a creation of sound industrial body that
can strongly face thechallenges imposed by the the coming global
era that requires the removal of allrestrictions that hinder
exchange of goods, services, technology, capital and expertise.
	   The whole world, within few years, would be turned into a small
village that knows nobarriers. So, local industry should be
prepared and the rehabilitation of firms should bespeeded-up to
comply with international standards and specifications.
	   During the honouring ceremony, industrialists agreed that May
30th of every year shallbe named ``a day for national industry,''
marking a historical event in the life of Jordanianindustry.

Malaysia announces agency to mop up bad debts
</HEADLINE>
  By ALVIN UNG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is setting up a new
agency to buy up banks' bad loans in an effort to bolster the
nation's economy, which has been buffeted by the Asian financial
crisis.
	   Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the government-backed Asset
Management Company will sponge up bad debt accrued by banks. Banks
then will have greater flexibility to lend money to healthier
businesses, he said.
	   Anwar said the agency will need some 25 billion ringgit (dlrs
6.4 billion) to buy up the loans. It will be financed by a mix of
bond issues and funds from the private sector.
	   Markets responded warily to the news.
	   Moments after Anwar made the announcement, the ringgit fell
against the dollar, trading between 3.93 and 3.96. Since the Asian
economic crisis swept through Malaysia last July, its currency has
plunged more than 35 percent against the dollar.
	   Although market analysts said the government move was in line
with reforms proposed for the financial system, they said most
investors were waiting to see what happens when the company begins
operations at the end of July. They were eager to see what types of
debts the agency buys up and which companies it helps out.
	   To raise money for the agency, Anwar said the government plans
to sell foreign bonds worth up to dlrs 2 billion as well as provide
the company a grant of 50 million ringgit (dlrs 12.8 million).
	   Additional funds, amounting to 6 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.5
billion), would be raised in the local bond market.

MALACCA, Wed. - Chief Minister Datuk Seri Abu Zahar Isnin today

<TEXT>
assured the people, especially investors, that there would be ample
piped water until September.
	   He said barring any untoward situation, the State would not
impose water rationing until September or October.
	   ``This follows rains recorded for two days last week and on
Monday. The water level at the Durian Tunggal dam has also risen
the past couple of days and therefore, is way above the critical
level,'' he said after chairing the State Exco meeting today.
	   Abu Zahar, who is also chairman of the Malacca Water
Corporation, had announced on April 20 that the State might have to
ration water in July following the decline in water supply at the
Durian Tunggal dam.
	   The dam is capable of storing up to 32,600 million litres of
water.
	   The Meteorological Department had forecast more rainfall in
September following a change in the weather pattern.
	   On another subject, Abu Zahar said the Malacca Municipal Council
would embark on a beautification and cleanliness campaign next
month.
	   The campaign, he said, would focus on eateries, toilets and
other public facilities and would be geared towards improving the
ambience and cleanliness of these places.

Student activists arrested in Nigeria clampdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Security forces stormed the campus of one
of Nigeria's top universities to arrest student activists and
suppress planned pro-democracy protests, a student leader said
Thursday.
	   Seven students, including the vice president of the National
Association of Nigerian Students, were arrested Wednesday during
the day-long operation at the University of Ibadan.
	   The detention came one day before students and some faculty
members had planned to hold a demonstration to mark the June 4,
1996, killing of Kudirat Abiola, the wife of jailed opposition
leader Moshood Abiola.
	   It was unclear whether the crackdown had prevented the planned
demonstration from materializing.
	   ``We want to assert that no amount of brutality, arrest,
intimidation of whatever form can change the minds of Nigerian
students from waging war against the military dictatorship,'' said
Ogunlana Oludare, chairman of the West Africa Students Union.
	   Oludare denounced Gen. Sani Abacha's ruling military junta and
said the University of Ibadan students were arrested without just
cause.
	   Ibadan, a growing hotbed of anti-government activities, was
shaken by rioting on May 1, when thousands of protesters took to
the streets. Police shot and killed seven activists and arrested at
least 30 others.
	   Police and military reinforcements have been deployed throughout
Ibadan and Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos in anticipation of
more protests against the junta over the next few weeks.
	   In addition to Thursday's anniversary to mark the death of
Kudirat Abiola, June 12 is remembered as the day when Abacha
canceled presidential elections in 1993 and began his rise to power
through a bloodless coup.
	   Fueling the anger are charges that Abacha's junta may be linked
to the Abiola's death.
	   Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 elections, was
jailed for treason when he defied Abacha's junta and declared
himself president. His wife was killed while campaigning for his
release.
	   For the past five years, Abacha has pledged to return power to
and elected civilian government, but has repeatedly reneged on the
promise.
	   In April he triggered a storm of protests by becoming the only
legal candidate to run for president in elections this August.

THE key to survival these days may be cost-cutting, but no

<TEXT>
matter how widespread, it remains painful and tricky.
	   Trimming the fat demands much more than just poring over the
accounts and divining what the company can do without. What if the
business bleeds in not-so-obvious ways? What about expenses that do
not show up in profit and loss statements?
	   Hidden costs come in many forms. The folk in the quality
assurance fraternity often talk about costs of quality (also
referred to as quality costs). Take the total cost of providing a
service, or of making or selling a product. Compare it with the
total cost if there had been no failure during any part of the
process. The difference is the cost of quality.
	   `Simply put, it is what bad quality is costing you. It is the
cost associated with someone, somewhere, not getting it right the
first time,' says J S Bhar, principal and director of Malaysian
Institute Quality Assurance Bhd (MIQA).
	   `The economic slowdown is a blessing in disguise because it is a
time for companies to look at what they are doing. In every crisis,
there is an opportunity. In this case, it is a chance to remove
weaknesses.' He says many local companies are hurting badly due to
heavy quality costs. He estimates that the average quality cost of
small and medium- sized companies is as large as 15 to 20 per cent
of turnover while that of larger companies is between eight and 12
per cent.
	   The good news is professionals who are trained and experienced
enough can be called in to conduct audits to pinpoint the problem.
These people will then give recommendations as to how to reduce or
eliminate these quality costs.
	   There is a snag. Bhar feels the local pool of expertise in this
area is just too small. This is a clear indication that quality
management in Malaysia has lots of growing up to do.
	   `Quality management has become an exact science. There is broad
awareness here about the importance of having quality assurance
systems.
	   You can see this from the number of companies that have joined
the rush to acquire ISO 9000 certification,' he points out.
	   `The problem is, wide acceptance is not necessarily the same as
deep understanding. CEOs, for example, tend to shy away from
attending quality management training. The top guys must be
spearheading such efforts.' Bhar says quality assurance is
essentially about meeting the customers' needs by looking at one's
capabilities. It enables a business to become cost-effective by
reducing failure. At the same time, it promotes teamwork without
sacrificing inter-competition.
	   Most quality management practitioners in Malaysia are science
graduates because quality management is traditionally in the hands
of engineers and technicians. Bhar observes that Malaysians have
not paid due respect and prominence to engineers. In the world of
professionals, engineers usually stand in the shadows of doctors
and lawyers when it comes to prestige. He says this is changing,
but should be sped up. This is where MIQA comes in.
	   As Bhar tells it, MIQA was conceived with selfless intentions.
Its motto, The Nation's Partner in Quality, seems to reflect this.
`I've been in quality assurance for 20 years, having started in the
oil and gas industry. I wanted to do something for the country.
It's like a lawyer after 30 years or so looking around and deciding
to seek judgeship,' he recalls.
	   `A lot of money was flowing out of the country for subscriptions
to foreign quality assurance organisations. MIQA is meant to give
practitioners a local forum.' MIQA describes itself as `the
professional body or learned organisation in Malaysia whose sole
purpose is the promotion and advancement of quality practices and
whose qualifications for individual membership are knowledge and
experience in that subject'.
	   It, however, differs from most other professional bodies in that
it is a public company set up under the Companies Act. Typically, a
professional body is set up under the Societies Act and accords its
members certain rights and a say in how the organisation is run. In
MIQA's case, the Companies Act states that its board of directors
and shareholders are the ones who make major decisions.
	   Bhar reveals that it was `a bit of a battle' to attach the words
`Malaysian Institute' to a `Bhd' company. `It's about
accountability,' he explains. `A society's office-bearers are
elected - that may lead to poor stewardship - and the filing
requirements are less stringent. Several prominent people have
agreed to serve as honorary fellows of MIQA. They'll see that MIQA
does a good job and sticks to its objectives.' Providing training
is part of MIQA's mission. It conducts courses which lead to
certificates, diplomas and advanced diplomas in quality management.
Recently, it began talks with Britain's University of Wolverhampton
on the acceptance of MIQA's advanced diploma as a qualification for
a Master's degree programme in quality management. If this goes
through, a person with an SPM certificate can obtain a Master's
degree in four years via a route that starts at MIQA.
	   Says Bhar, `Eventually, we see every organisation having a
quality assurance manager to put in place a programme for
continuous improvement.
	   He or she will have these qualifications.' MIQA publishes a
quarterly journal, Quality Today. Based on its maiden issue for the
first quarter of 1998, the journal has a circulation and readership
of 6,000 and 100,000 respectively. Individuals paying subscriptions
are allowed to use the designations `Fellow', `Member' or
`Associate'. Companies, government departments and educational
institutions can sign up as `Affliated Companies'. To date, MIQA
has in its fold 900 individuals and 260 corporate members.
	   On MIQA offering consultancy services, Bhar says it does not
intend to compete with any quality management consultancy. `We want
MIQA to be called in to help industries in quality management
matters that demand a certain level of expertise. We do not want to
be seen as just a body that conducts two-day courses.' MIQA, which
is scheduled to be officially launched in July, has a paid- up
capital of RM200,000. There are plans for a Mesdaq listing. Bhar
says it should have enough revenue from subscriptions, training and
consultancy work to qualify in two years.

SHAH ALAM, Wed. - In an effort to boost the level of Sungai

<TEXT>
Langat and ease the pressure on the Langat Dam, the State
Government has decided to pump at least 5.4 million litres of
underground water into the river daily.
	   The effort will entail sinking bores in three places along the
river identified by the Geological Department as suitable for the
purpose - near Sungai Lui, in Dusun Tua and another place yet to be
decided on.
	   The underground water, Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said
today, would then be pumped direct into the Langat river to boost
its level.
	   He said this would increase the volume of water to be treated at
treatment plants along the river, and ease some of the pressure on
the Langat Dam whose level has dropped markedly in the last few
days.
	   The bores would have to be at least 200 metres deep. Special
drilling machines were needed to bore to that depth.
	   ``The State Government is appealing to any department or company
which has the necessary equipment to help us sink the bores so that
underground water can be pumped direct into the river.
	   ``Those willing to help are requested to get in touch with the
State Secretary Datuk Hashim Meon or the State Exco Datuk Abdul
Fatah Iskandar at the State Government Building through telephone
number 03-5591957,'' he said, adding that the State Government
would pay for their services.
	   Speaking to reporters after chairing the weekly Exco meeting,
Abu Hassan said the State Government was also in the process of
reviewing the current water rationing exercise for 1.8 million
consumers who received their supply from the Langat and Semenyih
Dams.
	   The outcome of the review, he said, which would take into
consideration the level of rainfall in the next one week, would be
announced next Wednesday.
	   For the long-term plan, he said, water from five more lakes has
been identified for tapping and would be treated using the
ultrasource technique.
	   Besides that, he said, the Geological Department has also
identified four more underground water sources - Bukit Raja, Klang;
Batu Tiga, Shah Alam; USJ, Subang and in Wangsa Maju, Kuala Lumpur.
	   The State Government, he said, also planned to organise a
briefing session for State assemblymen, local leaders, members of
the non-governmental organisations and other interested parties to
explain the current water problems and efforts already taken by the
State Government to overcome it.
	   He said yesterday's meeting between Fomca and representatives
from the Selangor Waterworks Department showed many people still
did not understand the problem and how rationing worked.

AMONG THE great celebrations first in India and then in

<TEXT>
Pakistan, the nuclear armsrace in the Asian sub-continent has
started in earnest. Both sides declared that it isself-defence
which prompted their nuclear experiments, India being threatened by
itslarge neighbor China, and Pakistan reacting to the Indian
nuclear capability.
	   The issue has become a matter of national pride in both
countries, and beyond. Sideshave been taken, with those seeing the
Pakistan nuclear capability as an Islamiccapability, while
adherents to the theory of Third World power, hailed it as
anAsian-Third World nuclear victory. This is also just like the
recent past; the SocialistCamp then talked about the workers bomb,
while the West saw their bomb asprotecting the free world.At the
time, there was no consideration of the fact that the workers bomb
does not killaccording to class orientation and alliances, and the
free world bomb does notdiscriminate between oppressors and
oppressed. Just as now, there is nodiscriminatory power for the
effects of Asian nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we seemto misplace
our pride in achievements as a rule. The children of
under-development,have not realized yet that their strength will
not be enhanced by imitating the destructivemethods of the
developed world, but perhaps lie in adopting some of the
humanitarianaspects that have evolved over the years in the lands
of plenty.
	   Perhaps, it would have been far more profitable if India or
Pakistan have spent much ofthe resources that have gone for nuclear
research, on the more urgent and peacefulways of harnessing nuclear
power for national needs-specifically, medical, agricultural,and
power generating. The developed world is moving away from the use
of nuclearenergy, fearing the negative aspects of nuclear powered
plants. However, if it's aquestion of pride, then it should be
pride in fulfilling the urgent needs of their peoples.
	   But to compete in terms of weapons, which is incidentally the
likely scenario contraryto all declared intentions, is a massive
waste of resources, which will end in bankruptingeither nation if
not both. Hunger, and poverty are lethal when specifically
combinedwith weapons of mass destruction; they become instruments
of suicide when thesocio-economic security of a nation is eroded.
In any case, both nations, and ultimatelythe Third World will be
the losers in the arms race of the poor. If the ex-Soviet
Unioncould not sustain its nuclear arms competition with the USA,
it is not very likely thatboth India and Pakistan are likely to do
so in confronting the outside world, or eveneach other.
	   China developed its nuclear capability at a time when it could
have been afforded, andin which the ideological struggle was at its
highest, with the emergence of ``Maoism'' asan alternative way of
socialist orientation for the developing countries.
Consequently,superpowers pretenses with the associated trimmings of
nuclear capability wereessential in the logic of times to provide
an image of invulnerability and patronage to theprocess of
decolonization, and the emergence of the non-aligned bloc of
states.It is doubtful that such aspirations are harbored by India
and Pakistan, though it issufficient to say that they can have a
far superior role, and do provide theunder-developed world with
clear paradigms of achievements in the management ofhuman
resources, education, and models of economic development.The
strength of the Asian sub-continent lies in the fact that it has
always facedchallenges on all levels. And without any doubt, there
have been many achievementsthat stand out. Perhaps both countries
can show the rest of us the wealth of theirexperiences, rather than
the strength of their power to inflict damage.

HIS interest in Lat's cartoon books prompted young TV director

<TEXT>
Ng Ping Ho to direct a 16-episode sitcom, Kopitiam, currently
enjoying airtime over ntv7 on Mondays at 9pm.
	   ``I have always been fascinated by Lat's portrayal of an old
Chinese coffee shop in Ipoh. This influenced me when I got a shot
at directing a series.
	   ``I wanted a sitcom depicting city people with a mixture of
Eastern and Western values,'' said Ng who is also the scriptwriter
and producer of the series.
	   He drew inspiration too from the popular American series Cheers
for the half-hour Kopitiam as the former emphasised strong
characterisations.
	   ``I felt that Cheers was popular because people were fascinated
with the importance given to the characters.
	   ``I wanted to do something along that line, to make viewers fall
in love with the characters and thus be drawn to the show,'' said
Ng who did a degree in graphic design in England.
	   The whole process - from Kopitiam's conceptualisation to
auditions -took Ng a year.
	   ``The cast comprises mostly newcomers but the important thing is
that everyone is enthusiastic and willing to learn.''
	   The series revolves around Marie (played by Joanna Bessey) who
inherits an old kopitiam (coffeeshop) from her late father. She
turns it into a trendy cafe by giving the place a facelift while
retaining the original concept.
	   It deals with the characters' daily relationships including
their problems.
	   The other cast members are Douglas Lim, Mano Maniam, Lina Teoh,
Rashid Salleh and Tan Jin Chor.
	   The sitcom is produced by Double Vision Sdn Bhd.
	   ``The series' first season ends in July. If we go into a second
season, I intend to stick to the original concept and cast,'' Ng
said. ``Maybe this time around, we'll develop the characters even
further.''
	   Kopitiam recently won two awards at the 3rd Malaysian Video
Awards '98 held last week at the Putra World Trade Centre, Kuala
Lumpur. The awards, introduced in 1995, are to recognise those
behind the scenes in the making of TV dramas and advertisements. It
featured 25 categories of nominations.
	   The series won the Best Music (Orginal Score) award for its
theme song Empty Decorations, composed by and with lyrics by
Douglas Lim (who sang the number with Ng Chelsia).
	   The other prize was second placing for Best Script (written by
Ng).
	   ``Actually we had anticipated our victory especially in the Best
Music (Original Score) category as we felt the song was very
strong,'' said Ng.
	   ``Personally, this is the first time I am winning an award and
it means a lot to my career.''
	   Ng said he hoped that his victory would inspire more directors
and producers to come out with good quality dramas.
	   ``This is necessary as in previous years, the competition was
monopolised by advertisements. The number of dramas contesting was
relatively small.''
	   Ng said he hoped to see a change in the coming years.
	   On his plans, he said he was working on a script for a Malay
telemovie.

AMMAN HAS been the center of intense diplomatic activity this

<TEXT>
week aimed atpreparing the ground for the holding of an emergency
Arab summit to deal with thecurrent stalemate in the Middle East
peace process. The visit by Saudi Crown PrinceAbdallah Ben Abdel
Aziz to Jordan and his talks with His Majesty King Hussein andCrown
Prince Hassan, along with his meeting with visiting US
Undersecretary of Statefor Political Affairs Thomas Pickering,
underscore the importance of efforts beingexerted to formulate a
united Arab stand to face Israeli intransigence.
	   There is an agreement among Arab states that holding an Arab
summit has become anecessity as the region faces the threat of a
political upheaval triggered by Israel'srefusal to honor its
obligations and commitments. The Middle East peace process,which
has been pinned down for the last 15 months, appears to have
reached a pointof total collapse. US efforts to mediate between the
Palestinians and the Israelis havefailed to bear fruits, although
the Palestinians have accepted the latest Americanproposals.
	   The stalemate is already creating a sense of frustration and
despair in the region whichin effect promises to lead to
confrontations and violence in the Occupied Territories.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defiant policies are pushing
the entire region onto a road that will lead to violence and chaos.
His policies appear to aim atdeconstructing the peace process and
catapulting the region into a cycle of violenceand
counter-violence.
	   In the face of such threats, the Arab world, which took the
historic decision ofsupporting the Arab-Israeli peace process on
the basis of the exchange of land forpeace, must now give its
response to Israel's irresponsible policies and draw up a
newstrategy. The summit should also prove that a united Arab front
exists-this is themessage that both Washington and Tel Aviv must
receive.
	   Disagreements over summit agenda and structure must not hamper
efforts to convenethe summit. This is why we welcome Jordan's
announcements that it is ready to attendthe Arab summit.
	   The US, which has a special responsibility, must make its
position clear. There is everyreason to believe that Washington is
working closely to save what could be termed asthe last chance for
the peace process. In that regard, the Arabs will be
watchingcarefully what Washington does over the coming few days.
	   Israel, under Netanayhu, has made a dangerous reversal in its
position and has renegedon its promises and agreements. Such
actions must not be allowed to succeed withouta price. The Israelis
must be made to understand that they stand to lose too, if thepeace
process collapses.

THE 90s will be remembered as an excellent period for

<TEXT>
Swedish-Malaysian ties. In April 1994, Carl Bildt became the first
Swedish Prime Minister to visit Malaysia. Two years later, King
Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia arrived here for a five-day state
visit, the first by a Swedish monarch since Malaysia and Sweden
established a diplomatic relationship in the 60s.
	   There have also been many visits during the decade by ministers
from both nations, each paving the way for greater political and
trade co-operation. Why, even opposition party Democratic Action
Party sent a delegation to Sweden in May 1996! This was on an
invitation from the Swedish Social Democratic Party, whose
president Goran Persson is the current Swedish Prime Minister.
	   A key factor that led to Kuala Lumpur and Stockholm forging a
stronger bond is the former's drive towards industrialisation.
True, Swedish businesses have had a presence in Malaysia for
decades. For example, Bofors has been supplying guns to Malaysian
navy frigates since after independence, and Volvo cars have been
assembled locally since the 60s.
	   However, Vision 2020 entails a leap in industrial knowhow and
pace.
	   Sweden has a meaningful and deeper role to play in this respect.
After all, the Scandinavian kingdom has itself gone through a
second industrial revolution not too long ago. It shifted from
traditional sunset industries (shipbuilding, steel, textile) to
sophisticated areas like information technology (IT), biotechnology
and pharmaceuticals, and equipment manufacturing.
	   Technology transfer is an important building block in the
Sweden-Malaysia relationship. Said Bildt during his 1994 visit,
`Swedish companies are willing to share their technology and
expertise with their Malaysian partners. This is crucial to
Malaysia's desire to upgrade its industrial sector from
labour-intensive to capital-intensive by the year 2020. In fact,
the process Malaysia is undergoing is a common feature among
developing countries that want to become industrialised. This is
where Sweden can help.' Such assistance comes mainly in the form of
technical co-operation and training programmes offered by Swedish
big names operating in Malaysia.
	   These include Ericsson (telecommunications and IT), SKF
(manufacture of bearings) and Asea Brown Boveri (power
engineering). Equally useful to tap is Sweden's edge in other
fields such as environmental protection, defence and road safety -
Sweden has one of the lowest road fatality rates in the world.
	   Another channel for technology transfer is education. A notable
result of Bildt's trip was the establishment of a scholarship fund
that finances Malaysians pursuing post-graduate studies in
technology and engineering in Sweden. The RM2.5 million
Swedish-Malaysian Scholarship Fund is supported by Swedish
companies in Malaysia. Between 1995 and 1997, almost 30 people have
benefited from the fund. Co-operation in education went one step
further when Universiti Utara Malaysia and the International
Business School of Jonkoping University, Sweden, recently signed a
memorandum of understanding covering various areas.
	   Although Sweden has a clear advantage in many categories, there
are some areas in which Malaysia can be the teacher. For instance,
after talks with a delegation from the Swedish Parliamentary
Committee that came in September 1996, Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik
said Sweden was keen to learn about Malaysia's success in port
corporatisation.
	   Thanks to a healthy investment climate and strong growth
potential, Malaysia has been able to attract many Swedish
multinationals, providing them a solid base for regional and global
expansion in exchange for their expertise. But efforts to draw
investors must continue. As former Swedish Ambassador to Malaysia
Percy Westerlund put it in a 1995 interview, `Mutual ignorance is
why we cannot exploit the opportunities that are available.' A year
later, his successor, Harald Falth pointed out that ordinary Swedes
did not know much about Malaysia.
	   The selling of Malaysia to Sweden stepped up a notch or two when
International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz
visited the European nation in May 1994 to brief potential
investors and invite them to Malaysia. The state governments too
have been wooing the Swedes.
	   In 1997, two Perak delegations were in Sweden. The first was a
team from the State Economic Development Corporation while the
second was a trade delegation headed by Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli
Ngah Talib.
	   Recently, the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project has piqued
the interest of Swedish IT and telecommunications companies.
Ericsson Hewlett-Packard Telecommunication Sdn Bhd is said to be
the first Swedish-owned company to be awarded MSC status.
	   Sweden, of course, has many incentives for inward investments,
but few Malaysian companies have the resources to set up shop there
despite Falth's wish to see `the mutual exchange between businesses
in the two nations'. Westerlund suggested joint-ventures as a way
for Malaysians to gain a footing in Sweden. Interestingly, a 1997
study by the author of the annual Transparency International
Corruption Perceptions Index indicated that Malaysia and Sweden are
the countries least likely to pay bribes to gain international
contracts.
	   Bilateral trade has been in Sweden's favour for several years,
although Rafidah, during her 1994 visit to Sweden, stressed that it
was more important to enhance bilateral trade than to balance
trade. According to statistics supplied by the Swedish authorities,
Sweden last year imported Malaysian goods worth SEK (Swedish
kroner) 1.44 billion (100 Swedish kroner    RM52.40). These comprise
mostly electrical and electronic
products. Its exports to Malaysia was valued at SEK 4.17 billion,
comprising mainly telecommunications apparatus, cars and trucks,
pumps, and construction and mining equipment.	   Clearly, there is room for improvement. Neither country lists
the other as a top-10 trading partner. There is indeed scope for a
greater flow of goods between the two nations. Sweden is a member
of theEuropean Union and is centrally located in the fast-growing
Baltic Sea region, while Malaysia can be a gateway to Southeast
Asia and the Asia-Pacific.
	   Tourism is another area that demands attention. Falth said he
wanted to see more tourists from his homeland making their way
here. An encouraging sign is that a 1995 Tourism Malaysia survey
found that Swedish visitors are among the biggest spenders among
foreigners visiting Malaysia.

Two crew missing after Danish freighter sinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two Filipino sailors were missing
Thursday after a small Danish freighter collided in the Caribbean
with a Japanese fishing boat and sank, said the captain of the
nearby port of Barranquilla.
	   The Sea Star, a 65-meter (210-feet) freighter, slammed into the
Masayoshi early Wednesday about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of
Barranquilla, said port chief Luiz Mendoza. The freighter departed
Barranquilla for Haiti carrying 2,000 tons of cement, while the
Japanese boat was working for the Colombian company Vikingos.
	   ``We're just now beginning the investigation about what caused
the accident, which occurred in daylight in calm seas,'' Mendoza
told The Associated Press by phone.
	   The Masayoshi managed to remain afloat and its crew rescued five
members of the Sea Star crew, but two Filipino crew members were
missing, Mendoza said.
	   Among the survivors were the freighter's Danish captain, Michel
Sorensen.
	   Mendoza said the Japanese boat was working out of Cartagena,
another Colombian port on the Caribbean. It was expected to arrive
Thursday in Cartagena with the survivors from the Danish ship.

Literature and art both play a significant role in society, in

<TEXT>
that they reflect the nation'sways of living and display
diversified modes of thought.
	   It is the responsibility of the state to organize annual and
seasonal festivals which canfunction as a way for people to meet
and interact with each other.
	   In Jordan, everybody is familiar with the annual literature and
art festivals held inJerash, Fuheis, Zerqa and other parts of the
Kingdom.
	   However, this year saw a newly-born festival for literature, in
which poets and writersof short stories delivered their works. Held
under the auspices of the secretary generalof the Ministry of
Culture and Youth, the ``First Literature Festival'' started its
sessionslast week with the participation of creative writers and
enthusiastic poets from Jordan,Egypt, and Iraq. Held at the Hamlan
Charity Society in Marka, the one-week venuesucceeded in attracting
a large audience, who were knowledgeable on poetry andwriting, as
well as some art critics who expressed their approval for the
administrationand organization of the Festival.
	   Munir Mezyed, a poet and critic, aroused the sentiments and
emotions of the audiencewhen he recited his smooth flowing poetry
both in Arabic and English, whichdemonstrated his unique and
overwhelming style.
	   In one of his contemplating verses he says;When I think of
creationI believe in GodWhen I behold beauty I believe in art, When
I dream in love I believe in poetry But, when I feel happy and
content I believe in virtue.
	   The energetic poet had his first collection of poetry published
in English. It was titledHome, Love, Prayer. Graduated from British
and American Universities, Mr Mezyedhas published two collections
in Jordan, and now is about to finish a collection calledChapter
from the Bible. ``In this book, I speak about Christ as a
philosopher and as apoet,'' he explains.
	   His latest poem is called ``My Love,'' which is a romantic piece
in which he calls hisbeloved venus.
	   Meanwhile, from Egypt comes the delicate poetess, Manal El
Sherbiny, who holds aBA in English Literature and works as an
interpreter for the Jordanian daily, Al Aswaq.
	   Mrs Sherbiny opts for both classical and free style forms of
poetry, and she is currentlyoccupied with the preparations for the
publication of her first collection entitled Palm,Flute and the
Nile.
	   Her poetry has an air of romance about it, but at the same time,
if you explore furtherinto her style of writing, you will discover
that she inclines to modernism.
	   Poetess Nabeelah Al Khateeb also took part in the festival, and
she spoke about herearlier attempts to write poetry. Despite
marrying at an early age which hindered herwork, she managed to
continue her academic studies and graduate from the Universityof
Jordan whilst looking after her three children at the same time.Al
Khateeb, who is presently a teacher, published her first collection
in 1995. ``SabaAl-Bathan'' (Bathan is her home village, near
Nablus) was republished in 1996 when allprevious copies had been
sold out.
	   Her poetry is well known for its humanitarian and romantic
nature, whilst her newpoetry has been noted for the level of its
wisdom. She said enthusiastically, ``Because ofthis, one Syrian
critic compared my poetry with poems written by the famous Arabpoet
Zuher Bin Abi Salma.'' Her works are mostly covered by the press,
although other media forms are used,ensuring wide coverage for
critics and fans alike.Mrs. Al Khateeb has also participated in
many festivals within the Kingdom.
	   The holding of the First Literature Festival was a good
opportunity for poets, especiallyfor those who are in need of
promotion and assistance. However, the ``Young WritersFamily'' from
the Ministry of Culture and Youth criticized the weak coverage
itreceived from all media forms despite the intensive promotional
campaign thatpreceded the venue.

MANAGING large amounts of funds can be tricky. With the various

<TEXT>
ways in which they can be invested, a fund manager will definitely
have a huge task just monitoring the respective markets to locate
the ones with the best returns.
	   One leading software that helps the fund manager do just that
and much more, is CAMRA which stands for complete asset management,
reporting and accounting system. It is sold by Nasdaq-listed SSC
Technologies Inc.
	   The investment software and consulting company, which recently
saw its stock price on Nasdaq surge to US$ 17.00, is also taking
the Asian market seriously despite the ongoing economic confidence
situation. As T Thanendra Arasoo, managing director of SSC
Technologies Sdn Bhd puts it, `Our system is even more important
now to enable fund managers know what their risks and exposures to
particular markets are at any point in time, all with the click of
a button.' Arasoo, who is Malaysian, helped sway SSC's decision to
set up its regional office in Kuala Lumpur in 1996 over more
popular locations such as Hong Kong and Singapore. His familiarity
with local business conditions although spending 10 years in the
United States, a few of which were with SSC, and the Malaysian
government's commitment to technology as evident by its Multimedia
Super Corridor initiative, were reasons he cited.
	   And now SSC Inc would surely consider itself fortunate to have
made Arasoo its point man here. Reason: The country's largest fund
- the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) - has bought SSC's software.
Adding the EPF to its portfolio should do wonders in attracting
other asset managers to check out SSC's products.
	   But that is not to say SSC does not already have an impressive
client portfolio. In fact, the company says over US$ 1 trillion in
funds are managed using its software. `So clearly it is a system
that does what it is supposed to do,' quips Arasoo.
	   He says it was this fact that helped the EPF make the decision
to use SSC's system. `The fact that they were not going to be our
largest client was in a way reassuring to them. They are about the
seventh or eight largest client of SSC worldwide,' says the former
student of University Malaya. Among SSC's larger clients are the
world's two largest pension funds - ABP Netherlands (US$ 120
billion) and TIACREF, a teacher's pension fund in the US (slightly
below ABP's size).
	   So what exactly can SSC's software do that it can attract so
many takers? The Connecticut-based company's leading software is
CAMRA, followed by FILMS (or fully integrated loan management
system), both of which Arasoo says are able to handle all clients'
investment requirements.
	   `These products are designed and developed to support one's
entire investment process - from portfolio analysis, management and
trading to back office accounting and operations. In addition, they
can transfer one's holdings information into net asset value
instantly and accurately, saving valuable time, as well as update
all records and files and create reports on-line and real-time,' he
says.
	   Arasoo says CAMRA handles all the intricate accounting
requirements of one's investment holdings such as futures, options,
equities and fixed income, while FILMS enables one to integrate all
aspects of the loan management process such as commercial and
residential mortgages and corporate loans. The system is linked to
data providers such as Bloomberg, Reuters and Bernama, enabling it
to incorporate real-time information which is updated
automatically.
	   With these automatic updates, the overall investment position is
available at all times and the day's transactions and final asset
positions are obtainable at any time just at the click of a button.
SSC can also link its software with the customers' banks so that
the user can know his cash balances for trading purposes at any
point in time.
	   SSC targets pension funds, government agencies, asset/fund
managers, large corporations, insurance companies and banks. The
software, however, does not come cheap. Its minimum price is US$
200,000 and can go up to US$ 8 million, just for the licence. There
are fees to be paid for the training and implementation and
conversion of data from a user's old system to the new one.
	   It is no wonder than that only fairly large companies and
organisations can afford the system. According to Arasoo, their
smallest client has US$ 40 million on the system. `Our target
market is companies who have around RM150 million in assets to be
managed.
	   SSC Technologies Sdn Bhd is in talks with 20 to 30 such funds
made up of cooperatives, asset and fund managers, insurance
companies and government agencies in Malaysia, to sell them the
software. SSC Inc went international three years ago, with the
opening of its London office which was followed by the Kuala Lumpur
office.
	   As at the end of 1997, slightly more than 20 per cent of total
revenue came from international operations, a huge growth from the
previous year of about one per cent. The Asia Pacific contributed
about five per cent of the 20 per cent. `And that's after only
being one year in the Asia Pacific market place. We hope to double
that return for FY1998 ie, 10 per cent of total revenue,' says
Arasoo.
	   He adds that they had initially forecast this to be about 15 per
cent but have since revised it downward to 10 per cent because of
the region's economic problems. Companies in Korea and Thailand,
which were negotiating with them, have delayed their decision on
the purchase of the software.
	   For now the EPF remains its biggest client in Malaysia, using
SSC's system to handle all RM140 billion of its assets. The EPF
has successfully installed the system to handle all three of its
investment departments -corporate treasury, which handles its cash
flow and money market instruments, the equity department which
handles its equity investments and share transactions and its
corporate finance department which handles loans disbursed and
which uses CCS's loans system, FILMS.
	   Other clients in Malaysia include MBA Life and MBA Assurance,
who are in the process of implementing SSC's system. SSC
Technologies Sdn Bhd, the wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary also
recently closed a deal in Tokyo, the lead for which came through
the Internet.
	   `Someone saw our homepage which details the uses of our software
and requested more information on our products. The result is that
an insurance company, Aflac Japan, based in Tokyo, is now using our
system to manage US$ 20 billion of its assets.

Ezaldine Shahrori's latest exhibition entitled ``Old and New

<TEXT>
Inspirations'' at the gallery ofthe Jordan Plastic Arts
Association, marks a turning point in his spiritual development.
	   For anyone familiar with his previous work, the metamorphosis is
immediately obvious.
	   Shahrori has awakened from youthful illusions to a more mature
and spiritual-orientedartist embarking on new forms of expression
that bring renew vigor into his work.
	   His paintings still contain anecdotal tidbits that reveal the
tragicomic quality of life in theback streets of Jordan, but in
stark contrast to his previous painting, where theconcentration was
on the nude figure. ``My figures used to be naked women, because
Iwas influenced by women. And I did not know Allah,'' he confessed.
The work in hislast exhibition in 1997 at the Phenoix Gallery on
Wasfi Al Tal Street was devotedentirely to female nudes, which he
now describes as ``immoral,'' continuing that he ``hasnow repented.
I pray and have an encounter with my creator.'' Exhibit no.1 in his
recent exhibit is a good example of Shahrori's newly
foundspirituality. Like many of the pieces on display, it is
dedicated to the praises of Allah,starting stylishly with ``Allahu
Rahman Al Rahim'' (God, the merciful and the gracious).
	   Most of the 26 pieces on show are either Islamic calligraphy
dedicated to the praisesof Allah or extracts from the Holy Koran.
Others are shapes depicting old things aswell as new ones. ``I love
new and old things. However I must admit that I love oldthings
more,'' he revealed.
	   His prowess with color is unique, but it is his mastery at wood
carving that stand outthe most. On pieces 23, 24 and 25 he has made
use of wood and blended severalcolours to give them a copper-like
appearance. He continues his spiritual crusade byinscribing the
name of Allah on exhibit no. 24. 'Sura Til Hajj'; No. 12, an oil on
canvas,confesses an encounter with Allah, the creator. 'Rabilallah'
(God, our Lord) is by farthe best work in the show. Designed on a
golden board that glistens like real gold, itcreates the spiritual
atmosphere through which Shahrori conveys his message to
hisviewers. This piece also reminds us of the presence of Allah,
his mercy and grace-nodoubt one of the best depictions of the
symbol of good and plenty that Allah is.
	   In addition to the recent spiritual awakening that has
influenced most of his latestpieces, Shahrori also likes to shape
crowded scenes, dilapidated buildings and thedebris of broken walls
in Amman. His shapes are full of blended colours-black, greenand
violet-and recall passing times, nostalgic moments and, of course,
Shahrori'sfavorite, old things. Although only few forms portraying
the past featured in theexhibition, they demonstrate how much he is
influenced by the past, by old things 'ontheir way out.' Shahrori
was born in Kuwait in 1973 and studied fine arts in the Institute
of Fine Arts,Amman, Jordan. ``Old and New Inspirations'' is his
third exhibition-the first two tookplace last year in Amman.
Despite he is young, his talent is far in advance of his age.
	   The paintings on display depict God-man relationship, man and
his environment and asociety in full evolution. He uses his own
mechanism to tell a simple story with aneffective message about his
perception of life. ``I like to live and appreciate the realitiesof
life,'' he declares.
	   Shahrori paintings, with their concentration on spirituality,
submission to Allah, and areal interest in the common folk of
Jordan, present a world that is ever changing andwithin which man
should be grateful to Allah.His exhibition continues till 6 June at
the exhibition hall of the Jordan Plastic ArtsAssociation, near
Darat Al Funun, Al Mallah Street in Jabal Al Weibdeh, in Amman.

COURTING DANGER ... Despite tragic reports of boats capsizing,

<TEXT>
and the publicity on life-jackets, these children seem oblivious to
the danger they face.
	   For these students, safety is furthest from their minds as they
cross Sungai Perak daily to go to school.
	   The students are from several kampungs in Hulu Perak which are
still left behind in development because of their location.
	   Despite the inconvenience and danger involved, they still have
to risk their lives daily to pursue education as there are no
secondary schools on their side of the river.
	   The nearest secondary school is in Lenggong about 10km away or
about 80km from Ipoh. After the boat ride, the students are crammed
into a van for the rest of the journey by road.
	   As there are not many vans available, a van which can carry six
or seven people, have to take in as many as possible in order to
save the long trip to the three secondary schools in Lenggong.
	   There are about 90 students from Kampung Chepor, Luat and
Kampoung Beng, studying in Lenggong.
	   The boat ride costs each of them RM5 per month while the van
owner charges another RM20 a month to ferry them to their schools.
	   Some of them claim to have safety jackets but rarely wear them
as they are quite used to the mode of transport and river
situation.
	   According to Lenggong Assemblyman Talha Ismail, plans are afoot
to build a bridge across the river for the benefit of some 3,000
villagers on the other side of the river.

Sri Lankan military opens new front in drive to capture highway
</HEADLINE>
  By NIRESH ELIATAMBY  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Heavy fighting raged Thursday in
northern Sri Lanka as government troops broke out of their bunkers
and attacked Tamil rebel defenses in a two-pronged assault on the
region's main highway, military officials said.
	   The attack opened a second front in the military's bloody
13-month-old campaign to wrest control of the highway through the
rebel-held northern jungles.
	   Details of the fighting were not immediately available since the
area is out of bounds for civilians. But military officials who
asked not to be named said fierce artillery and mortar fire raged
throughout the day near the town of Kilinochchi, as the guerrillas
counter-attacked advancing government soldiers.
	   The endless wail of ambulance sirens echoed through Colombo, as
more than 50 wounded soldiers were airlifted to the capital 275
kilometers (170 miles) to the south.
	   The road connects the northern Jaffna Peninsula to the rest of
Sri Lanka.
	   Jaffna is a former stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam captured by the army two years ago. So far, the troops have
captured about two thirds of the highway, with another 27
kilometers (17 miles) to go.
	   Since the army takeover, Jaffna's half million people have had
to rely on air and sea deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   The military has so far been pushing northward up the road, but
stout rebel defense at the town of Mankulam has stalled the drive.
Thursday's fighting heralded a military drive south from
Kilinochchi in a bid to take the rebels from the rear.
	   The rebels are demanding a separate homeland, accusing the
Sinhalese majority of oppressing the Tamil minority.
	   The war began in 1983 and has so far claimed 52,000 lives.

THE WORLD Cup is upon us again, and it looks set to be the
'Mondial of theDecade'. For most of us, this World Cup is quite
different.
Like everything eat numerous sites. What's more, you could possibly

<TEXT>
even watch a large part ofa match on the Internet, if you have the
a connection with the right speed.
	   On another front, Helwett-Packard has implemented an advanced
networkingenvironment, based on UNIX, which will enable the large
number of journalists anddelegates at the World Cup to stay
in-touch, and exchange electronic information withthe whole world.
This relies, in part on the Internet too.The World Cup has always
created a craze among computer users. Sine the earlyeighties, when
personal computers took off, game software producers have fought
overthe rights to produce the 'official' World Cup computer game.
Football games areamongst the top selling software categories. FIFA
World Soccer is a massive hit andtop seller, and so are so many
other football computer games.
	   To all the computer and football fans out there, we say 'have a
great World Cup';thanks to advanced networking technologies and the
Internet, this is one World Cupthat fans will be able to view on
their PC screen and on their TV.

AS is customary upon entering a Japanese restaurant, greetings

<TEXT>
of irashaimase met us when we stepped over the threshold of Agehan
at the Radisson Shah Alam. Barely a year old, the restaurant is
Agehan's second branch in Malaysia after its flagship in Johor
Baru. The Radisson's Agehan is a small set-up; we were there for
lunch on Friday and most of its smaller tables were occupied. We
settled comfortably in a space separated from the main dining area
by a wall of wooden slats.
	   The restaurant has a sushi counter, two teppanyaki bars, a
private room which seats 20 people and a VIP room that accommodates
eight. Agehan's specialities are sushi, sashimi and tempura, and
the menu offered an overabundance of choices. Finally, we settled
on a selection that ranged from raw octopus and buckwheat noodles
to fried shrimp in batter.
	   We started off with futo maki or rainbow roll (RM27 each), which
proved to be a pleasant surprise. The deceptively simple roll is an
art in itself: the rice has to be at the correct consistency, and
flavoured with just the right amount of vinegar. Kudos to the
chef's combination of crabsticks, cucumber, pickled seaweed, radish
and egg rolled in a tight sheath of rice and seaweed.
	   Rather than the ubiquitous miso soup, friend Emma decided on the
dobin mushi (teapot clear soup). This came in a quirky little
ceramic teapot whose lid is used to slurp the soup with. The soup
was a clear broth boiled with a slice each of chicken, fish and
shrimp. It was an interesting blend of sweet and savoury.
	   Colleague Naz and I, raw fish aficionados, had sashimi high on
our agenda. The seafood at Agehan is ordered fresh on a daily
basis. The sashimi teishoku (lunch set at RM42) brought mixed
reactions from the both of us. The set arrived with slices of tako
(octopus), giant clam, tuna, yellow tail and cuttlefish neatly
arranged on a bed of shredded cucumber in a simple wooden platter.
We eagerly delved into the tako and found to our utter delight that
the flesh was succulent and had a mild, pleasing flavour - a world
away from the rubbery and bland tako served in some restaurants.
The sweet giant clam, likewise, surpassed expectations, and it was
a pity that the rest of the sashimi drew only lukewarm response.
	   Emma searched in vain in the menu for buckwheat noodles (soba)
with seafood, but not tempura (noodle dishes range from RM12-24).
The restaurant manager was called, and he was more than obliging,
explaining that customers often placed special orders too. So
straight from the kitchen came Emma's wholesome bowl of piping hot
soba in soup with seafood - a piece each of fish, shrimp, and
cuttlefish. Emma was clearly delighted by their freshness and the
firm texture of the noodles, but found the soup a tad too salty.
	   I found the chawan mushi (steamed egg custard) rather bland.
While the consistency of the egg custard was smooth, the filling
was rather scant: I had to burrow deep for my coveted slices of
chicken and shrimp.
	   Disappointing, too, was the fact that the kitchen had run out of
eel. So we settled for horse mackerel, which was slightly
over-grilled and dry.
	   Naz ordered the gyuniku shogayaki (sauteed beef with ginger
sauce) lunch set at RM24, one of Agehan's specialities. This came
served on a tray with miso soup, rice, and pickles. She tucked in
with gusto, and with reason, for the beef was tender and sauteed
just right. She especially relished the cut of the meat: tender
flesh interspersed with slender sections of fat. The sweet ginger
sauce lent the dish a slightly tangy flavour.
	   The tempura platter failed to wow us aesthetically but won high
marks for taste. Its simple presentation belied the freshness of
its mouth-watering morsels. The fried batter encasing the
vegetables and shrimp was crisp and crumbled deliciously in the
mouth. The prawns were juicy and firm to the bite, while the
vegetable pieces were just as delectable. I especially enjoyed the
succulent shiitake mushroom which everyone mistook for eggplant.
	   Of course, we had iced coffee, green tea ice-cream and fresh
fruits to round off our sumptuous meal. All set lunches come with
iced coffee and dessert. The iced coffee was a typical Japanese
affair: weak and deliciously icy. A green tea ice-cream connoisseur
of sorts, I found the Agehan version to have a good consistency and
slightly creamier than the confections at other restaurants.
	   For a new kid on the block, Agehan scores substantial points for
the freshness of its ingredients.
	   One thing though. On that day, we were seated away from the main
dining area, but the waiters did not come in to check on us to see
if we needed assistance, and there was no way to get their
attention other than to holler. All told, however, if you're in the
vicinity of Shah Alam or happen to be working there, it might be
worthwhile to check out Agehan.

IT WOULD be fair to say that there is a growing number of
'Internet addicts' inJordan, especially nowadays as Internet
Service Providers in the country are offeringunlimited access (24
hours a day, seven days a week) for as little as JD 35 a month.
This time last year, it cost around the same sum to get only

<TEXT>
twenty hours on theInternet! What's more, the Internet's sweeping
effects on society have meant that so many moreyoung Jordanians are
logging in, to get all the information they need on their
favouritetopics.
	   In short, it may be time that a study was conducted regarding
the number of hours in aday spent by locals on the Internet. It
should produce some interesting results. Also,we need to look into
any side effects that may be resulting from excessive use of
theInternet.
	   Already in Europe and the USA, their are people diagnosed with a
number of mentaland physical illnesses due to over exposure to
computers or the Internet! This is a long and interesting topic,
which we will provide detailed coverage of in thecoming weeks.

IN THE April 16 issue of Malaysian Business, it is mentioned

<TEXT>
that many are still sceptical about the position of Datuk Wira Mohd
Saleh Sulong within the DRB-Hicom Group despite his repeated and
earnest explanation of his close relationship, both personal and
work-wise, with the late Tan Sri Yahaya Ahmad. This, perhaps, can
partly be explained by his own admission about being, essentially,
a `back-room boy'. Undeniably, it takes time to develop and project
a new image. It is most heartening, though, to note from the
article that Saleh intends to carry out the plans conceived with
Yahaya to provide a modern, reliable, comfortable and efficient
public transportation system at reasonably affordable fares.
	   At a recent press conference, Saleh reiterated this intention.
The public are, therefore, taking note of this with great
anticipation.
	   Otherwise, Saleh is in for a `bashing'. This can only be
expected as the public has waited long enough and heard enough
excuses as to why Intrakota buses have not been functioning as
expected. The public does not want this declaration of intent to
remain just that. They want action. Intrakota must be more
committed and service-oriented, right from the top management to
the lower-level executives and drivers.
	   What is urgently needed to solve (if not all, at least
partially) the woes of the commuters is not an MBA degree but
hands-on management, and some common sense. The management or its
agents need only to station themselves at the various bus- stops
and travel incognito on the buses during peak hours to see and
experience for themselves what is really happening out there.
However, be forewarned about the frustration involved! Irregular
schedules, long waits and crowded buses. These are common
complaints, but Intrakota has a ready answer for them - the
infamous Kuala Lumpur traffic jams. This may be a factor, but do
check the depot. For all we know, there may be buses there that
ought to be on the road. It may also be a genuine case of shortage
of buses. In respect to the traffic jams, the management need to
work closely with the Kuala Lumpur City Hall or Dewan Bandaraya
Kuala Lumpur (DBKL) and other local authorities to identify
bottlenecks/congested roads, and put forward suggestions on
improving routes to ensure smoother flow of traffic.
	   Malfunctioning and out-of-tune traffic can create unnecessary
jams. The authorities, therefore, must ensure that it functions
well at all times and attend to reports of malfunctions quickly. It
is unfortunate that this simple matter has not been taken seriously
by those responsible.
	   Overcrowded buses can be minimised if appropriate steps are
taken to have adequate number of buses on the road, and if bus
drivers are instructed not to take any more passengers when the
permissible capacity has been reached. The commuter will not mind
missing a bus if he/she knows for certain that the next bus is on
schedule and he/she does not have to wait very long.
	   Apart from more frequent bus schedules, waiting time can be
reduced if certain steps are taken to improve the system of picking
and alighting passengers at certain busy points. At present,
commuters are made to wait while the passengers get off the bus.
Moreover, commuters can only board a bus from a certain point. This
is fair enough if the bus-stop is meant for buses heading towards a
specific destination only. But it becomes ridiculous when there
are, say, four buses headed towards different destinations arriving
almost simultaneously, with each having to wait for its turn to
move forward to that designated spot to pick passengers up.
	   The scenario is made worse when, in fact, there is ample space
for each to do so simultaneously, saving waiting time.
	   One can imagine the chaos when everybody rushes to that
particular spot to board their respective buses. To make sure they
get onto the right bus, the commuters will have to turn their heads
a full 90 degrees (may be 180) to see the bus route number. Why?
Because the queue normally has its back to the bus. It is all very
amusing to watch, especially the whole line craning its neck
backward. Of course, this holds true only when one does not have to
endure it personally. But wait, it is even more comical to watch
when it rains and everyone holds whatever comes handy over his/her
head to keep out the rain.
	   More pick-up points should, therefore, be located at strategic
locations or where there is heavy human traffic, and each must be
properly numbered with the relevant routes and destinations clearly
stated. These points need not necessarily be at the doorstep of
places of public interests. As long as they are within walking
distance, the commuters will not have much to complain about. It is
not that commuters want to be pampered, but more so due to our
unpredictable weather. These waiting points, however, should be
user-friendly with commuters being made to queue up to face the
oncoming bus.
	   To be able to provide a modern, comfortable, efficient and
reliable public transportation system at an affordable rate is
indeed an achievement. But Intrakota has a long way to go. Being a
major service provider, it has to condition itself to be able to do
so. It has a responsibility to the public and is answerable to
them. It can't afford to behave arrogantly and pass remarks about
not being a welfare body at the public's slightest complaint. If
the company cannot accept complaints from the public, then it
certainly is in the wrong kind of business! The company's drivers
need to be properly advised not only on good driving habits but
also on human relations. There have been reports of instances where
passengers have fallen off buses due to reckless driving, and cases
of drivers being rude or abusive of passengers. These drivers have
no right to act in such an uncouth manner. They probably need a
refresher course on proper driving techniques and counselling for
their attitude problems. They can be dangerous if allowed to
continue driving buses! Drivers should also be told not to drive
too fast so that commuters can read the number of the buses and
have sufficient time to stop them. There have been instances where
the poor-sighted, especially the elderly, missed buses because they
noted the bus number a tad too late. Then, there are instances
where the driver would stop the bus quite abruptly to pick up these
poor-sighted passengers, causing some standing passengers to fall.
	   The driver would then complain to whoever cares to listen about
how these passengers tahan bas at the very last minute.
	   Buses should also be clean and in good working condition. We are
already witnessing reasonably new Intrakota buses being stranded on
the roads - a cause for traffic jams. This is a shame and reflects
badly on the company as someone has failed to do his/her job. Route
numbers must be prominently displayed not only at the front but
also at the sides and backs of the buses. This will give the
commuter a second chance to look at the number without having to
run to the front of the bus, straining his head upward.
	   This little act of concern will certainly hold good for the
company.
	   The issues mentioned above may appear trivial/nit-picking but
they form the essence of good public transportation service and
they need to be addressed fast. The management needs to seriously
look into these matters.
	   It cannot simply treat these issues as something inconsequential
to be swept under the carpet. It should seriously consider
counselling for its personnel for the good of everybody. The
commuters would certainly love to see a smiling driver for a change
instead of a scowling face.
	   To be fair to Intrakota, the relevant authorities, including the
DBKL, Public Works Department, Commercial Vehicle Licencing Board
and the police need to do their homework thoroughly to ensure that
the infrastructure for the efficient running of the public
transportation system is in place.
	   They need to plan, within their constraints, the most conducive
traffic flows that would provide accessibility to areas of public
interest without unduly causing traffic jams. This basically
requires proper and intensive study of people movement within and
outside the specified area, and other logistic considerations.
	   With the Commonwealth Games just around the corner, it is
everyone's hope that all parties involved in the public
transportation system will do their level best to improve and
co-ordinate their services, so as to project a good image of the
country. Hopefully too, in the not-too-distant future, our public
transportation system would be so good that we would rather leave
our cars at home. And as to you Saleh, all the best.

THE CONCEPT behind the creation of Microsoft's Internet Explorer

<TEXT>
4.0 ArabicEdition was not to recreate the Explorer, but to further
increase the availability ofArabic language software in the region.
With IE 4.0 Arabic Edition, Microsoft hassucceeded in opening a new
door for Arabic users who may be unable to use theEnglish language
or more simply, prefer to use a Web browser in their own language.
	   In addition, Internet Explorer Arabic will facilitate on
all-Arabic environment whenaccessing Arabic Web sites that are
becoming more common in the region. This willeventually lead to the
creation of an Arabic Digital Nervous System that will
facilitatecommunication on levels to the entire Arabic speaking
world.
	   How is Internet Explorer 4.0 Arabic Edition different from the
English version?
	   Internet Explorer 4.0 Arabic Edition has the same features as
the English version, withthe addition of a specific new feature for
Arabic being Multiple Code Pages, Arabicsupport in E-,mail, and
Arabic Web page development with FromPage Express.
	   What are active channels?
	   Active channels are streams of information from content
providers who provideregistered subscribers with updated,
personalised information on any subject to theirPC via the Web.
Subscribers are able to connect to any type of information
service,whether it be world financial news or entertainment and
sports news. Updatedinformation can be 'pushed' to the subscribers
PC periodically. The subscriber can alsopersonalise the information
being received by choosing the preferences that he or shedesires.
The thought behind the release of IE 4.0 Arabic Explorer is to
encourage thegrowth of such services in the Arabic language.
	   When will we see these available in Arabic?
	   At present, there are no active channels in Arabic due to the
previous unavailability of acomplete Arabic solution to support
this. Now, with t he latest edition of IE 4.0Arabic, we expect
fully functioning Arabic channels to be online in 3 months time.
Thefirst Arabic channel, which will be providing news services, has
been confirmed.
	   What are Microsoft's views on the impact this new Arabic version
of Explorer 4.0 willhave on the Web in the Arabic speaking region?
	   Microsoft believes that the release of Arabic Explorer will not
only contribute to moreArabic users logging on the Web, but will
actually encourage content providers to putmore Arabic content on
the Web, thus facilitating the growth of Arabic presence on
theInternet and increasing the number of Arabic Web sites
available. Microsoft believesthat this will benefit the region and
the proliferation of Internet usage as companies inthe Middle East
will be able to operate with the same levels of efficiency as
othercompanies in the U.S. and Europe. This will be a first for the
Middle Est and itsexecution will be partially attributed to the
release of Internet Explorer 4.0 ArabicEdition.
	   Due IE 4.0 Arabic Edition support an Arabic search engine?
	   Index server is the index and search engine of Internet
Information Server. Bothproduct ship with Microsoft Windows NT and
support the Arabic language'sexact-matching' searches. There are
complimentary Arabic search products on themarket, built around
Miscrosoft's Internet Information Server (IIS), that
provideadditional features.
	   Where can users get their hands on a copy?
	   Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Arabic Edition has been in the
market for severalweeks. Internet Explorer Arabic Edition is
available free of charge and can be downloaded off the Microsoft
Web site:    http:/ www.microsoft.com/ie/download/.

VOLATILITY, be it in the money or equities market, can be a

<TEXT>
dreadful thing. This is evident in the way the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange Composite Index (KLSE CI) swings. Investments turn from
sweet to sour while decision-making becomes a delicate affair.
	   Amidst the emaciating state of affairs in the equities market,
trading of equities futures - which is carried out at the Kuala
Lumpur Options And Financial Futures Exchange (KLOFFE) - seems to
be thriving from this volatility. The KLSE CI's volatility has set
the much needed fire to rocket KLOFFE's equities futures market.
	   The figures are telling. From an average of a pathetic 350
contracts per day in 1996, trading on KLOFFE has dramatically
turned exuberant since the second half of last year. Interestingly,
this was also the time when the equities market began to slide (see
chart on volume and open interest).
	   Last year, KLOFFE averaged 1,700 contracts per day, largely
boosted by a strong pick-up in volume in the second half. Average
turnover per day in the second half of the year was 2,300
contracts.
	   The uptrend is continuing this year. The average daily turnover
for January was 2,900 contracts while February saw 3,700 contracts
being traded. Over the past two months, the average has soared to a
high of more than 4,000 contracts being traded per day. What is
more encouraging is that the number of open interest, ie, contracts
which are not closed yet, has reached an encouraging 16,653 in the
first week of this month and is increasing. This indicates that
more and more players are holding their position for longer-term
gains rather than merely indulging in intra-day trading, which was
a common feature in the past.
	   The CI futures market is growing, without a doubt, due to a host
of reasons. In fact, one remisier even goes as far as saying that
many investors now take the cue from the futures market to help
them make a decision on whether to buy, sell or hold their
investments in the equities or cash market. `When the futures trade
at a large discount from the cash market, the indication is that
bearish sentiments are likely to set in the market. So, the more
vigilant investors take note and sell when they see a slight sign
of weakness appearing in the equities market,' explains the
remisier.
	   But can the interest in the trading of the CI futures be
sustained? What does this market have that has kindled the interest
of retailers?
	   KLOFFE started the trading of CI futures on Dec 15, 1995.
Although start-ups for new investment instruments are always
difficult, in this case, it appeared that the interest in KLOFFE
took ages to pick up. `There were hardly any retailers in 1996,'
says Hamzah Mahmood, the director of Kenanga DMG Futures Sdn Bhd.
But in February this year, retailers made up 30 per cent of the
players in the futures market. Foreign investors dominate the
market demography in KLOFFE's equities futures by making up 50 per
cent of the total interest, while locals (meaning dealers) make up
16 per cent (see chart on market demography year to date).
	   According to Hamzah, one key reason why interest in KLOFFE has
picked up is the `volatility and crisis' in the stock market, which
paved the way for investors to capitalise on their views of what is
going to happen in the cash market. `Assuming that at the beginning
of the day, an investor thinks that things are going to go bad in
the cash market. The futures market allows the investor to
capitalise on his or her view by selling short. The main thing is
in the futures market; an investor can make money when the cash
market goes up or down by playing long or short respectively.
Compare this with the cash market where most investors make money
only when the market goes up,' he says.
	   Several analysts concur with Hamzah's view. They say retailers
and foreign institutions are using the futures market to make some
money as everybody knows that bearish sentiments dominate the
market. Justin Jiaseng Soong, the vice-president of HDM Futures Sdn
Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hwang-DBS (M) Bhd, says he had
expected the increased activity in KLOFFE as trading of equities
futures is still growing in Malaysia. In developed markets, say
both Hamzah and Justin, the value of transactions in equities
futures is about three times that of the cash market. This means
that if the value of trade in the KLSE is RM200 million, then the
value of transactions in the KLOFFE should be three times more.
	   Last year, KLOFFE was doing about 30 per cent of the total value
of the KLSE. In April this year, KLOFFE's value was 120 per cent
that of the KLSE. Thus, the upside potential for growth in equities
futures is tremendous. Besides the growth potential in equities
futures due to its infancy, Justin also attributes volatility in
the equities market as another key reason. `With volatility, there
is some movement in the CI which gives room for prediction.' Hamzah
feels there are other factors which have also contributed to the
rise in interest in equities futures. `In equities futures, an
investor is investing in the movement of a basket of stocks.
Compare this with the cash market where an investor needs to know
about the developments surrounding that particular stock he or she
has picked, or if it is cornered. Equities futures is easy,
efficient, and traded based on the CI, which is a widely-known
underlying index,' he adds. Hamzah, who had his early training in
financial derivatives with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation's Kuala Lumpur and London offices, also feels that the
dual licenceship network of remisiers has helped to get more
investors to participate in the equities futures.
	   Under the dual licenceship concept, besides the conventional
equities market, remisiers are also futures dealers representatives
whereby they get a commission for soliciting clients for the
equities futures market.
	   `The equities futures can only grow. The market has grown
tremendously, even without active participation of local
institutions. Once the local institutions come in, it will be
bigger,' says Hamzah.
	   Foreign institutions have taken the lead in KLOFFE by being
responsible for 50 per cent of the total number of contracts being
traded. In contrast, local institutions form a negligible one per
cent. `Had local institutions participated more actively in the
futures market, the more astute of them would probably be flushed
with more funds today to pick up the cheap stock in the equities
market,' observes Justin.
	   Most large local institutions are not participating in the
futures market directly because they are bound by regulations which
do not allow them to trade in the futures business. `Besides
regulations, many fund managers are still not familiar with
equities futures. Moreover, the Nick Leeson episode is still fresh
in the minds of many local institutions,' says one fund manager.
Leeson is a Singapore-based derivatives dealer who brought down
England's once-indomitable Barings Plc through his misadventures in
trading in the Nikkei futures index.
	   Hamzah admits that trading in futures can be a risky affair, but
the rewards are ample. `The Leeson affair has nothing to do with
the product.
	   It is a healthy product. The Leeson affair has taught the
industry to maintain a clear division of duties between the trading
and settlement of contracts. When trading in futures, one has to
actively manage the risk.
	   The traditional investment view of keeping scripts in the drawer
cannot do,' says Hamzah.

IMAGINE your e-mail as a legal document. You would be able to

<TEXT>
send official invoices, and exchange contracts using electronic
documents instead of using electronic methods of communication for
discussion and having to rely on relatively expensive and slow
courier services to move the paperwork around. The time and money
saved would help your company take advantage of rapidly changing
markets.
	   The Malaysian Digital Signature Act 1997 recognises a `digital
signature' on an electronic document as equal to a written
signature on a paper document. The Act describes the necessary
processes for creating and verifying digital signatures, as well as
detailing the responsibilities of the parties involved.
	   Trusting your electronic documents Companies are wary of
allowing electronic documents to be the same as legal documents for
two basic reasons.
	   First, there's the possibility of being deceived by a false or
forged document. Recognising fake signatures on paperwork is much
simpler than recognising fake electronic signatures. If you have an
authentic example of your customer's signature, you can see at a
glance if that customer's signature on an order is the same. You
can also tell fairly easily if the document has been tampered with
- a three turned into an eight to increase the invoice, or a change
of date made with whitener so that an old invoice can be used
twice, for example.
	   The other concern is secrecy. Most companies are very sensitive
about keeping their information secret. Having a rival company's
strategic plan for the next year or knowing that there is a fat
contract being negotiated can be of immense value. How do you keep
your confidential documents private when they are travelling
through cyberspace?
	   Of these two concerns, damage caused by tampering may be worse
than damage caused by disclosure. For example, if a hacker knows
that your bank account is being credited with half a million a
month from your best customer, it is a breach of security and you
may worry that rivals will use this information to reduce their
prices in an effort to make themselves more competitive. However,
it would be a complete disaster if that hacker took your
funds-transfer authorisation and changed the transfer destination
to his own account (and possibly sell your invoice information on
top of that).
	   Recognising fakes When looking at a legal document (say, a
contract or a cheque) you need to be confident that a) it was
signed by a person with proper authority, and b) the signer cannot
deny that the document has a valid signature.
	   Security experts call these two characteristics of the document
`Authentication' and `Non-reputability'. You also need to be
certain that the document has not been altered in any way and that
it was sent by the authorised sender. This is called `Integrity'.
But can you recognise an electronic fake?
	   Not at a glance, no, but there are ways to prove a document is
intact and has come from the correct source. Digital signatures use
encryption, certification, and security to confirm that the
document is original and from the right source.
	   Encryption is used to transform the message so that it is
unreadable by anyone who intercepts it and can be used to prove the
document has not been altered after it was signed. To do this,
various parts of the message are encrypted at different times and
in different ways.
	   A closer look at encryption When encrypting a document, a
mathematical formula called an algorithm is used to transform your
ordinary electronic document text into cipher text, much like the
stuff of spy novels. There are many ways you can create a cipher.
You might do so by shifting each letter, for example forward one
place in the order of the alphabet: Mary had a little lamb Nbsz ibe
b mjuumf mbnc Another common strategy in spy novels is to select a
page and paragraph from a book. Let's say you use the start of the
second paragraph of this article as your base. You want to send a
message, `Mary had a little lamb.' Mary had a little lamb Each
letter has its place in the order of the alphabet. A  1 B  2 etc 13 1
18 25 8
1 4 1 12 9 20 20 12 5 12 1 13 2 The Malaysian Digital corresponds
to 20 8 5 13 1 12 1 25 19 9 1 14 4 9 7 9 20 1 12 Add the two lines
13 1 18 25 8 1 4 1 12 9 20 20 12 5 12 1 13 2 20 8 5 13 1 12 1 25 19
9 1 14 4 9 7 9 20 1 12 And get 33 9 23 38 9 13 5 26 31 18 21 34 16
14 19 10 33 3 Convert this back to letters so that the message you
actually send is: Giwlimezeruhpnsjgc The recipient has turned the
second paragraph into numbers, subtracts these (33-20  13, 9-8  1
etc) and gets the original message.
	   The advantage of this code is that you need to know the
encryption key to decode the message.
	   From encryption to digital signature The single key encryption
examples above are known as `symmetric encryption algorithms'.
Obviously both the recipient and the sender need to use the same
key. This type of encryption is not very secure which is why
digital signatures rely on more complex encryption methods.
	   `Asymmetric algorithms' use a pair of keys. Each key looks
completely different from its partner. One is called the `private
key'. It is kept a closely guarded secret and is used to encrypt a
message. The other is called the `public key' and is used to
decrypt the message.
	   In a very basic sense, asymmetric algorithms work like the
examples above, except that instead of simply adding or subtracting
a number, more complex mathematics are used. Some `magical'
properties of prime numbers allow us to use a pair of distinct
numbers to get the same result! This means that by using the
`public key', you can decrypt any message that was encoded using
the `private key'. If the private key is kept secret, only the
owner can use it to generate a message; anyone in the world can use
the public key to verify that the message was encrypted with the
other (private) half of the key pair.
	   Let's say you have a letter of credit from your customer. You
can verify the bank's signature by using the bank's public key. If
the signature does not match, then either the message has been
changed or the signature was not generated by the bank. Either way
the document is not valid.
	   You can confirm that the owner of a public key is the true owner
by checking with certification authorities. The certificate
authenticates the owner of the private half of the key pair.
According to the Act, a network of key certification authorities,
and repositories from which public keys will be available, will be
set up and maintained.
	   Asymmetric encryption then provides non-reputability (only the
owner of the public key can generate the signature) and integrity
(the signature must match the content of the document). The
certificate and repository system provides authentication.
	   Security issues What issues should be considered when investing
in encryption programs?
	   Your company will have its own tried and tested security
policies. A level of in-house security must be maintained by users
and receivers to keep the digital signature safe from unauthorised
use, and to keep electronic documents from being lost or corrupted
by accident.
	   Eventually when the certificate and repository system is
established there will be some set of approved programs available
so you might want to wait until these issues are officially
clarified before starting to use digital signatures. However, with
more and more sensitive information being stored on the hard-disks
throughout your company, it might be worth the effort to start
experimenting now.
	   There are many encryption freeware, shareware and branded
products available. Before investing in a package or designing your
own, be sure to understand your needs.
	   Analyse who might be interested in stealing your information.
How sophisticated will would-be hackers be? Decide on the level of
security necessary. Your data may need to be unreadable by
unauthorised people for some minutes, one year, or forever
depending on your business.
	   What system do you need? You might want to consider an e-mail
plug-in, or something that encrypts on-line communications. What
should you encrypt? You might want to encrypt everything or just a
few strategic files. What are the costs and benefits of encrypting
and decrypting everything?
	   When talking to vendors, beware of poorly conceived encryption
programs.
	   Experts have nicknamed these `Snake Oil' programs, a reference
to bogus patent medicines sold in the United States last century.
Snake oil programs seem to act like encryption programs but contain
serious flaws.
	   If the vendor refuses to explain how the program works, you are
forewarned. Encryption programs do not work because the algorithms
and/or other devices they use are secret! Hackers have the time and
the enthusiasm to work out how individual encryption programs work
by reverse engineering it. A proper tool will anticipate this.
	   Security in the digital world is a complex topic with encryption
being only one small aspect. For a look at how other Digital
Signatures Act issues will be dealt with, check the online version

AHMAD is the eldest in a family of five children living in an

<TEXT>
urban squatter area near Butterworth. His father, a factory worker,
does not contribute much to the family as he has another family in
Penang.
	   As Ahmad's mother is forced to stay home to mind the children,
Ahmad and his seven-year-old brother work to support their family
by selling cakes their mother makes.
	   On good days when he is able to sell all his cakes, he makes
about RM20.
	   On bad days he worries about the beating he will get from his
father when the cakes don't sell too well.
	   Ahmad's case highlights the abused rights of an indirect child
worker - a child working for his parents, sometimes under duress -
who does not understand his own dire need of a basic education.
	   Superficially, this more surreptitious Malaysian variety of
child labour does not seem to constitute outright aggression
against so-called ``innocent victims'' (children), but scratch a
little beneath the veneer and you see the thousands of children
forced to work long hours, and who are subjected to a spectrum of
direct and indirect abuses.
	   It is an oft-repeated fact that Malaysia does not have as large
or as odious a problem with child labour compared to Thailand, the
Philippines, India and other countries in the region. But the
figures stare you in the face.
	   For despite the Children and Young Persons Employment Act (1966)
which prohibits the employment of children below 14, the 1980
Malaysian Census Report found that there were 73,000 child workers
between the ages of 10- 14 employed in various sectors.
	   Since then, there has not been any official figures of child
employment, but it is estimated that something between 100,000 and
200,000 - or three per cent of children below 15 - are employed.
	   This would seem especially true if the case of 15-year-old Suria
from the Tnamaram Plantation is taken into account.
	   The diminuitive teenager, who works in an electronics factory
that is an hour's van ride away from her home, is on top of the
world. She earns, in her mind, a whopping RM600 a month; not bad
considering that neither her older brother nor her father earn that
much.
	   Given the dire straits from which she emerged after her mother
died a couple of years ago, Suria is doing well. The second child
in a family of five, she dropped out of school two years ago during
her mother's illness to help care for the family.
	   Now that her grandmother helps with the cooking and
childminding, Suria is free to chip in to the family's income.
Asked if her working conditions are tolerable, she declares:
``Baik. Banyak senang. Semua orang baik.''
	   (Fine. Everything's fine. Everyone's nice.) Suria sees no point
in attending school as it does not give her the immediate economic
help she needs. Furthermore, she is happy with her life now.
	   But Suria's situation is one of the happier faces of the
multi-facetted issue of child labour in Malaysia. Besides, as far
as the law is concerned, at 15, Suria is not a child but a ``young
person''.
	   Generally, children who are directly or indirectly employed work
in the urban informal sector in the food business and night
markets, small-scale industries, rubber and oil plantations and
workshops.
	   In the eyes of those who work with directly or indirectly
employed children, child labour is by far the most common form of
child abuse.
	   Under the wide and multi-coloured umbrella of child labour, the
basic rights of children are at best suppressed and at worst
violated.
	   For child labour constitutes the most insidious form of
aggression to plague the young and it is the duty of all
governments to eradicate this blight.

Kosovo Albanians pull out of talks, condemn Serb offensive
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS with ethnic Albanian delegation saying talks
off, warning from Albanian government official, OSCE statement;
Trims. No pickup  
  With Albania-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian officials pulled out
of talks with the Serbian government Thursday, demanding a halt to
the fierce offensive that has devastated villages and sent tens of
thousands fleeing in Kosovo province.
	   Serbs, meanwhile, said a police and Yugoslav army assault across
western Kosovo was a protective sweep against separatist guerrillas
in the Serb-ruled province where ethnic Albanians comprise the
majority.
	   ``All our actions are defensive in character,'' insisted Veljko
Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo. ``We are
simply responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   Ethnic Albanians say dozens of villagers have been killed and
tens of thousands of people are hiding in forests in the
independence-minded province of southern Serbia, waiting for a
chance to escape to neighboring Albania.
	   An estimated 12,000 people have crossed into Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry said.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled into Montenegro, the other
republic left in what remains of Yugoslavia besides Serbia,
Montenegrin officials said.
	   The Albanian government, worried about the crush of refugees and
a new threat for its strapped military in Europe's poorest country,
is pushing for Western troops to shore up its northern border _ a
request NATO is considering warily.
	   ``We expect everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano, said in
the Albanian capital Tirana.
	   The Serbs' latest crackdown on the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
advocates Kosovo independence, prompted Kosovo Albanians to scrap
Friday's scheduled round of talks with Belgrade government
officials.
	   ``The escalation of force against Albanian civilians is in
contradiction with the spirit of the talks,'' Fehmi Agani, a member
of the Albanian negotiating team, told The Associated Press. ``That
makes the continuation of talks impossible.''
	   His side will reopen talks when the use of force stops, a
blockade of sealed-off zones is lifted and Albanian negotiators are
allowed to visit those areas, he said.
	   The Decani region of western Kosovo remained sealed off
Thursday, and the extent of continued assaults by Serb army, police
and paramilitary forces was unclear.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center in Kosovo said one man was killed when
a Yugoslav army border patrol fired on an armed group trying to
cross over illegally from Albania.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the KLA, which now claims to
control about 40 percent of Kosovo.
	   Delegates to Europe's leading security organization, the OSCE,
on Thursday condemned the violence and called for restraint.
Meeting in Vienna, they also urged full access to the affected
areas and said Serb security forces were blocking entry to
humanitarian organizations.
	   In response to growing concerns the Serbs are carrying out a
strategy of forced expulsions, Odalovic claimed ethnic Albanians
have ``cleansed entire villages of their Serb populations.''
	   The KLA has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks
on Serb police and Serb sympathizers.
	   There was evidence of the militants' growing popularity in the
provincial capital Pristina on Thursday, when more than 10,000
ethnic Albanians flooded the main street to protest the latest Serb
violence.
	   The crowd, comprised mostly of young people, chanted ``U-C-K'' _
the Albanian-language acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army. Some
carried placards reading ``NATO help save Kosovo.''
	   Unlike in the past, no one chanted ``Rugova'' _ indicating
declining support for the ethnic Albanians' longtime leader Ibrahim
Rugova, whose pacifist approach has failed to bring results.
	   Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian politician,
acknowledged Rugova has no influence over the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which ``does not want to hear of him.''

Abkhazian leader optimistic about settlement talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the breakaway province of Abkhazia
said Thursday that he had made significant progress toward settling
his region's longstanding conflict with Georgia, a news agency
reported.
	   Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba met with Boris Berezovsky,
the Russian tycoon who is executive secretary of the Commonwealth
of Independent States. Afterward, Ardzinba said he was prepared to
meet Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze soon, Interfax said.
	   Berezovsky is in the region trying to settle the dispute between
Georgia and Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia
that declared independence in 1992.
	   In a 13-month war, Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian
troops and 300,000 ethnic Georgian civilians, and fighting still
erupts frequently in the region. Georgia wants to give Abkhazia
considerable autonomy, but not the full independence that it
insists it already has.
	   Although there has been no word about the specific terms being
discussed, Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying he was confident
that Ardzinba and Shevardnadze intend to make decisions acceptable
to both sides.
	   ``All conditions have been created for making decisions with
concrete results,'' he said.
	   Berezovsky met Wednesday with Ardzinba in Abkhazia, then flew to
Tbilisi for meetings with Shevardnadze, then returned to Abkhazia
on Thursday for further talks with Ardzinba, Interfax said.

	   CHAKOTI, Pakistan (AP) _ It's not nuclear bombs that worry Jamal
Ali, who lives in the shadow of Indian guns along the most volatile
stretch of the frontier.
	   It's ordinary bullets and sometimes artillery.
	   Every few days, machine gun fire ripples across his village. No
one pays too much attention unless the artillery or mortars open
up. Then Ali moves his family into the ravine by the Jhelum River
and sits it out.
	   Nuclear testing last month by India and Pakistan has refocused
attention on Kashmir, the disputed territory in the Himalaya's
verdant foothills seen as the most likely flashpoint of a nuclear
confrontation.
	   The Kashmir issue has been simmering since 1947 when the two
great rivals of the Indian subcontinent were created from the dying
British empire. Both sides claimed Kashmir, which had a mostly
Muslim population and a Hindu prince. It was the direct cause of
two wars that left the area divided, with Pakistan controlling
two-thirds.
	   ``Until the fate of Kashmir is decided, there will never be any
peace in this village,'' said Ali, a grizzled 60-year-old
landowner.
	   That, apparently, is the feeling of the U.S. administration,
which planned to raise the Kashmir issue during a meeting Thursday
of foreign ministers from the original five nuclear powers.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington on
Wednesday that the Geneva meeting should grapple with ``the
underlying problems between India and Pakistan, including
Kashmir.'' Her comment appeared to take U.S. policy further than
before in advocating direct outside involvement to settle the
dispute.
	   Albright's statement worried India, which rejects any mediation
on what it sees as a bilateral problem. Pakistan welcomes such
offers of help, and routinely appeals for international discussion
of Kashmir.
	   Tension rose swiftly after India conducted nuclear tests and
Pakistan responded two weeks later. Threats and belligerent
statements flew across the border with gunshot speed, raising fears
that the animosity may spin out of control.
	   But not on the border. Gunfire continued its intermittent
chatter in Chakoti, a cluster of simple concrete buildings amid
small crop fields on a plateau wedged between Indian and Pakistani
forward positions. This front is 110 kilometers (70 miles)
northeast of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
	   ``There's been no increase in cease-fire violations'' since the
testing began, said the sector's field commander, Brigadier Haider
Khan.
	   Incidents are frequent, but casualties are low _ and they are
usually civilians caught in their fields when the shooting begins.
Khan said 41 civilians were killed last year in his sector, and no
soldiers.
	   Though both countries tested low-yield devices suited for
battlefield weapons, nuclear arms would be useless on this front
line, where Indian and Pakistani gunners fight a static war of
harassment from hillside bunkers just a few hundred meters apart.
	   ``We are eyeball to eyeball. Nuclear weapons don't affect us,''
said Khan.
	   Once the summer playground of south Asia's rich, Kashmir's
mountains, deep gorges and rushing rivers are now the setting for
gun emplacements, mine fields and barbed wire on both sides of the
cease-fire line.
	   Since 1989, Kashmiris on the Indian side have been in open
rebellion, seeking to break away from the predominantly Hindu
nation to either join Islamic Pakistan or become independent. The
conflict has cost 15,000-20,000 lives.
	   Opponents of Indian rule held a general strike Thursday to
coincide with the Geneva meeting, shutting down shops and emptying
the streets of Srinagar, the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir
state.
	   Pakistan claims India has 650,000 troops in Kashmir to contain
the uprising and defend its borders. India says the number is
150,000 _ only slightly more than on the Pakistani side.
	   India accuses Pakistan of aiding the rebels by giving them
training, weapons and cover fire when they slip across the porous
frontier, called the Line of Control.
	   Khan denied that. ``Nobody moves across the Line of Control,''
he told a group of foreign correspondents Wednesday, claiming it
was in Pakistan's interest to stop them. ``This also involves our
security. How can we have people moving left and right?''

THE current downtrend began in late March on news of corporate

<TEXT>
failures and concerns that there would be more winding-up petitions
and companies going into receivership. The suspension of Omega
Securities, and subsequent fears over the fate of margin trading
accounts, sparked off another round of steady selling. Towards the
second week of May, social unrest in Indonesia escalated with
violent demonstrations in Jakarta calling for the resignation of
Suharto. This brought the market down further.
	   On May 15, Tenaga Nasional Bhd announced its interim results.
Forex losses were huge at RM2.47 billion. This time, though, the
market reacted calmly. It may have discounted the news as there is
a consensus that Tenaga's results will improve over the longer term
as interest rates are expected to ease with the ringgit improving
by then.
	   In the current unsettled market, stock selection should perhaps
be based on the following criteria: Stocks with good fundamentals
for their resilience, compared to stocks with weak fundamentals;
Oversold stocks with good fundamentals for their attractive values
which were unjustifiably driven downwards on irrational market
sell-off.
	   These stocks, on recovery, are expected to swing sharply to
reflect their true worth.
	   Below are selective stocks with good fundamentals that may have
been unjustifiably oversold. On an upturn of the market, these
stocks should regain their worth.
	   From the KLSE CI's recent peak of 736 for the period March 25 to
May 18, these stocks have fallen more than the index: 1. CMS 6. MTD
2. Proton 7. PBB 3. RHBCap 8. Magnum 4. Tenaga 9. Maybank 5. RBH
10. S.Darby From the KLSE CI's low of 477 for the period Jan 12 to
May 18, these stocks have not recovered as much as the index: 1.
MNR 6. Carlsberg 2. HL Credit 7. KL Kepong 3. Hock Seng Lee 8. RJ
Reynolds 4. Pacific Bank 9. CMS 5. S.Darby 10. B-Toto On
technicals, the recent drop to the 545.32 point low on the KLSE CI
marks a 75 per cent pullback of the January-February run-up from
470.43 to 764.94. The RSI on the weekly chart may continue its
downward course to the trendline support of around 30. This
suggests that the market would easily breach the 545 support level,
targeting 526 which is the 81 per cent retracement level.
	   Although the market sentiment is weak, the month chart points to
strong trendline support on the downside in the area of 500. As the
market has not yet broken the low of 470.43, the possibility for
the market to stage an upswing remains.
	   There is then a 50:50 chance that the current downtrend from the
764.94 high may turn out to be wave B, part of the Elliott A-B-C
correction. In this scenario, the market should not breach the
470.43 low as there is one final upward push to complete wave C. It
should retest the high of 764.

Lesotho's new Cabinet sworn in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Lesotho's new Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili watched while his new Cabinet was sworn in Thursday _
minus a deputy prime minister and two other appointments.
	   Later in the day, former foreign minister Kelebone Maope said he
was offered the deputy position and would in all likelihood be
joining the Cabinet next week.
	   Before Lesotho's elections last month, Maope was mentioned as a
candidate for prime minister.
	   Mosisili said geographic origins played a role in choosing the
Cabinet so that every community would ``feel to be part of that
government.''
	   Tom Thabane _ a special advisor to the former president, Ntsu
Mokhehle, who retired at the elections _ was named foreign minister
to replace Maope.
	   A new portfolio was created for Environment, Women and Youth
Affairs, to be headed by the only woman in the Cabinet _ Mamshebi
Kabi.
	   The former Information and Broadcasting and Transport and
Telecommunication departments are merged into a new Communications
Department, with Nyane Mphafi as minister.
	   Mokhehle's brother Shakhane Mokhehle was offered Works and
Transport later on Thursday, and is likely to accept it soon, the
South African Press Association reported.
	   Mosisili also serves as Minister of Defense and Public Service.
	   The Lesotho Congress for Democracy won 78 of 79 National
Assembly seats contested last month. The opposition Basutho
National Party won one seat.
	   Other ministers are Leketekete Ketso, Finance and Development
Planning; Mopshatla Mabitle, Local Government and Home Affairs;
Monyane Moleleki, Natural Resources; Sephiri Mtanyane, Justice,
Human Rights, Law, Constitutional Affairs and Rehabilitation; Mpho
Malie, Industry, Trade and Marketing; Lesao Lehohla, Education;
Notsi Molopo, Employment and Labour; Vova Bulane, Health and Social
Welfare; Hlalele Motaung, Tourism, Sports and Culture; and
Mofelehetsi Moerane, Minister in the Prime Minister's office.

Kosovo Albanians pull out of talks, condemn Serb offensive
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CORRECTS in 8th graf from ``except'' to ``expect.''
  With BC-Albania-Kosovo
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian officials pulled out
of talks with the Serbian government Thursday, demanding a halt to
the fierce offensive that has devastated villages and sent tens of
thousands fleeing.
	   The Serbs, meanwhile, denied that the police and Yugoslav army
assault across a broad swath of western Kosovo is a strike at
civilians, describing it as a protective sweep against separatist
guerrillas.
	   ``All our actions are defensive in character,'' insisted Veljko
Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo. ``We are
simply responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   The ethnic Albanians say dozens of villagers have been killed
and tens of thousands of people are hiding in forests in the
independence-minded province of southern Serbia, waiting for a
chance to escape to Albania.
	   An estimated 12,000 people already have crossed into that
neighboring country, the Albanian Interior Ministry said.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled the battered Serbian province
into Montenegro, the other republic left in what remains of
Yugoslavia besides Serbia, Montenegrin officials said.
	   The Albanian government, worried about both the crush of
refugees and a new threat for its strapped military in Europe's
poorest country, is pushing for Western troops to shore up its
northern border _ a request NATO is considering warily.
	   ``We expect everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano, said in
the Albanian capital Tirana.

Bowe pleads guilty to abducting wife
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL NOWELL  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion
Riddick Bowe pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal charge stemming
from the abduction of his wife and children from their home.
	   Bowe, who was not sentenced Thursday, could face 10 years in
prison and a dlrs 250,000 fine.
	   Bowe arrived at the courthouse with his former manager, Rock
Newman, and two men Newman described as family members. He declined
to speak with reporters and did not address the court when asked by
U.S. Magistrate Judge Carl Horn if he wished to do so.
	   He simply answered ``Yes, sir'' when asked a series of questions
by Horn, including whether he understood the charge against him and
that by pleading guilty, he waived his right to appeal.
	   However, Bowe seemed in good spirits before the plea hearing,
joking with Newman and shadow-boxing in the hallway.
	   He was represented in court by attorney Ed Hinson, although U.S.
Attorney Mark Calloway told Horn that Johnnie Cochran Jr., who
successfully represented former football star O.J. Simpson on
murder charges, also represented Bowe. Cochran was not present.
	   The grand jury indictment, handed down Tuesday, alleged that
Bowe used ``force, coercion, duress and fraud'' in taking Judy Bowe
across a state line, from North Carolina to Virginia. Mrs. Bowe and
the couple's five children were uninjured in the alleged abduction,
authorities said.
	   Cornelius Police Chief Ron McKinney said the Feb. 25 incident
began when Bowe drove to his wife's home in the northern Charlotte
suburb.
	   Bowe ordered his wife and children into the car and began
driving toward his Maryland home, McKinney said.
	   Bowe went about 200 miles (320 kilometers) before stopping at a
fast food restaurant in South Hill, Virginia, where Judy Bowe was
able to get to a telephone and call her sister, Lynette Shaw, in
Cornelius, McKinney said.
	   Shaw called police, and officers went to the restaurant and
spoke with the couple. Judy Bowe told authorities she and her
children did not want to go to Maryland, so police arranged for
them to be returned to their home.
	   Authorities decided to conduct additional interviews and consult
state police in North Carolina and Virginia as well as the FBI
before deciding whether to arrest Bowe, McKinney said.
	   Later that day, Bowe entered a medical treatment center for
counseling and therapy, Newman said.
	   The boxer has had other troubles since leaving the sport.
	   In May 1997, shortly after Bowe announced his retirement, he and
his sister, Velma Melton, were involved in a spat in which both
reportedly suffered split lips. Bowe quickly announced a
reconciliation.
	   Bowe joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1997 and reported for
three months of basic training, but he dropped out 11 days later.

Russian river floods despite bombing to break ice jam
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES thruout with river flooding  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A ice-jammed river burst its banks on Thursday,
flooding dozens of homes, barns, offices and a child care center in
northern Russia, a news agency reported.
	   Hours earlier, fighter planes had bombed the ice jam on the
Pechora River in a futile effort to prevent flooding.
	   The ice had piled up 30 kilometers (18 miles) down river from
the city of Naryan-Mar, capital of the Nenets region, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   On Wednesday, demolition experts broke up an ice jam 65
kilometers (40 miles) upstream. Water that had inundated the
villages of Labozhskoye and Velikovisochnoye then receded,
ITAR-Tass said.

SEM's chairman and chief representative officer of Sharp Group

<TEXT>
of Companies Malaysia Datuk Sumizo Akahodani said data collection
and collation as well as product generation and development, took
about 12 months.
	   ``A total of five Japanese and 10 local engineers were involved
in the entire RD process of the RN1 series. In terms of materials,
about 90 per cent, excluding the cathode ray tube (CRT) was sourced
locally while the remaining 10 per cent came from Taiwan and
Japan.''
	   He said by sourcing materials locally, SEM has been able to
reduce its production cost by about 25 per cent and in turn,
translate this into significant savings for consumers without
compromising on product quality.
	   Yamaguchi said the total cost of development of the RN1 series
was about RM3.7 million - RM2.2 million for the 29-inch model and
RM1.5 million for the 25-inch model. Retail prices for the two
models have yet to be determined.
	   SEM is Sharp's only RD centre in Asia apart from Japan, with a
total of 110 engineers comprising 95 Malaysians and 15 Japanese.
The centre, which moved to its Shah Alam location from Petaling
Jaya in February this year, costs about RM40 million to be
established while the Sharp-Roxy Sales and Service Company (M) Sdn
Bhd - also in Shah Alam - costs about RM20 million, said SEM's
managing director Tsutomu Takeuchi.
	   Last year, SEM recorded a turnover of RM665 million and expects
an increase of about 40 per cent this year, with a target of RM900
million.

  Hezbollah attack in south Lebanon wounds Israeli soldier
  Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with Hezbollah announcing death of
fighter

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in
southern Lebanon early Thursday, wounding an Israeli soldier,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The attack came hours after the leader of the militant guerrilla
group, Hezbollah, hinted he may order rocket attacks on Israel,
which would breach the April 1996 understanding on avoiding
civilian casualties in the southern Lebanon conflict.
	   The pre-dawn bombing took place near the village of Haddatha, on
the northern edge of the Israeli-occupied zone and 22 kilometers
(15 miles) southeast of the port of Tyre, said security officials,
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said a soldier was
moderately wounded by a bomb that exploded as a convoy of Israeli
armored vehicles was passing.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said guerrillas attacked
Israeli forces with ``appropriate weapons,'' scoring ``direct
hits,'' near Haddatha at 2 a.m. (2300GMT Wednesday)
	   In another attack Thursday morning, Hezbollah guerrillas said
they fired rockets and machine guns at an Israeli outpost at Sojod,
some 35 kilometers (21 miles) northeast of Tyre, destroying
fortifications.
	   Security officials and the Israeli army did not comment on the
second attack.
	   Hezbollah on Thursday also announced the death of one of its
fighters.
	   A statement issued by the group said Hassan Kassem, 32, who
joined the ranks of Hezbollah in 1984, died Wednesday. It did not
say how Kassem was killed.

Seles beats Hingis to rock French Open
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with new Seles, Hingis quotes; background on stabbing
incident.
  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing two weeks after the death of her father,
Monica Seles jolted the French Open Thursday by beating Martina
Hingis 6-3, 6-2 to reach the final.
	   Seles, in a throwback to her championship days, scored a
convincing victory over the world's No. 1 player and will meet
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario for the title.
	   During the match, Seles drew inspiration from her family in the
stands at Roland Garros Stadium. As she has all tournament, Seles
wore her father's ring on a chain around her neck. Karolj Seles
died of cancer May 14.
	   ``It was really nice to share a win like this with them,'' Seles
said.
	   Seles served well, made few errors and most of all, painted the
lines with sizzling groundstrokes in her startling victory.
	   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive,'' she said.
``I knew I had that in me.''
	   Seles had never beaten Hingis in their previous five matches and
now advances to her first Grand Slam final since the 1996 U.S.
Open. Seles won in Paris three straight years (1990-92), becoming
the first woman to achieve the feat since 1937. Last year she lost
to Hingis in the semis.
	   All of Seles' three victories here came before April 30, 1993 _
the day she was stabbed by a crazed fan during a match in Hamburg,
Germany. She didn't return to the tour until August 1995.
	   Asked Thursday if she felt like the real Monica again, she
replied: ``I don't think the real Monica ever left.''
	   ``But it never will be the same as before the stabbing. And I
don't want it to be.''
	   Seles, the No. 6 seed, hit a cross-court backhand winner past
Hingis to close the match, then clenched her fist. She tapped her
racket and smiled as she walked off the court.
	   Hingis, who all week played brilliantly, seemed unable to cope
with Seles' power. Normally composed on court, the Swiss star was
reduced to scolding herself and bouncing her racket on the clay in
frustration.
	   Hingis was hoping to move on and play for the only Grand Slam
title to elude her. Instead, Seles gets Sanchez-Vicario, a 6-3, 7-6
(7-5) winner over Lindsay Davenport in an earlier semifinal.
	   ``Everybody knows I can play better tennis than I played
today,'' Hingis said. ``Sometimes it's hard to keep concentrating
match to match.
	   ``She didn't make any mistakes. I didn't get the chance to get
back into the match,'' she said.
	   ``I just probably put too much pressure on myself. I really want
to win this tournament.''
	   In the first set, Seles broke Hingis for a 3-2 lead, hitting two
backhand winners in a row.
	   The players stayed on serve until 5-3, when Hingis twice
double-faulted to give Seles a 0-40 lead. A point later, Hingis
netted a weak backhand into the net to end the set.
	   Hingis broke Seles in the opening game of the second set, after
five deuces. But Seles broke right back for 1-1, then broke Hingis
again in the fourth game for 3-1, and held for 4-1.
	   In the next game, Seles actually overruled the net judge, giving
Hingis her only ace of the match. They stayed on serve until the
final game, when Seles broke Hingis for the fifth time in the
match.
	   In the other semifinal, Sanchez Vicario was at her gritty and
relentless best. Davenport, the No. 2 seed, hit her groundstrokes
with power, but had trouble keeping them inside the lines. She made
56 unforced errors, with 34 in the second set. Sanchez Vicario had
29 the entire match.
	   ``I know she was very tired, and I just had to just hang in
there,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, the No. 4 seed from Spain.
	   Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario made a great
effort to send back a high defensive lob. Davenport responded with
an overhead, but it sailed wide.
	   ``I always think you have a chance if you get the ball back,''
Sanchez Vicario said.
	   Davenport conceded she hadn't played well.
	   ``I guess I beat myself, but she kind of forced it on me,'' she
said.
	   In a match where service breaks were the rule, Davenport didn't
hold serve once in the first set, and held serve only twice in the
second. Sanchez Vicario held only twice in each set.
	   The Spaniard has had a long career at the top of women's tennis
and has won three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and 1994 French Opens
and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   Davenport, meanwhile, has never reached the final of a Grand
Slam tournament despite being ranked second in the world.
	   For a semifinalist, she has been modest indeed. Asked earlier in
the week if she felt overlooked, she replied, ``If I were a betting
person or a journalist, I'd overlook myself also.''
	   She described herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
A boring story.''

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A top Albanian official sounded a warning
Thursday about the possibility of Serb forces coming across the

	   ``We expect everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
said Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano.

Museveni urges bishops to support punishment for Rwanda genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni urged Anglican
bishops Thursday to support severe punishment for those who planned
and executed the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
	   ``The bishops should support an eye-for-an-eye principle to deal
with those responsible for genocides,'' Museveni said in a speech
delivered on his behalf by Francis Ayume, a minister in his office.
``Without punitive measures, the culprits will not learn a
lesson.''
	   Without quoting directly from the Bible, Museveni argued that
parts of it ``allow punitive measures. The church must not shy away
from using punitive measures,'' he said.
	   Anglican bishops from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo are meeting in Kampala to prepare for
world-wide Anglican conference in London next month.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly minority Tutsis, were
slaughtered during a campaign organized by the Hutu extremist
government.
	   Museveni, a close ally of Rwanda's Tutsi leaders who ended the
genocide and ousted the government, has publicly called for the
execution of those convicted of planning and carrying out the
genocide.
	   So far, the Rwandan courts have convicted and sentenced to death
more than 100 people in connection with the slaughter.
	   On April 24, the first 22 people convicted of genocide and
crimes against humanity were excuted by firing squad in Rwanda.
	   There are still 130,000 people are awaiting trial in overcrowded
jails throughout Rwanda.
	   Museveni also asked the bishops to support harsh measures
against rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army fighting government
forces in northern Uganda.
	   ``In northern Uganda, people are affected by the war,'' Museveni
said. ``There are killings and they (people) want justice to be
done to the killers.''

Hezbollah leader says deal close on Israel-Hezbollah swap
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-8 with Israeli prime minister's comments

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - The leader of Hezbollah guerrillas says a
deal has nearly been completed with Israel for the release of
Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the return of body parts of
Israeli soldiers.
	   ``Negotiations are now taking place on some details,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah said in a Wednesday night television interview.
	   ``If we work out these details, a prisoner exchange deal can be
concluded,'' he said in the interview with the private station Murr
Television. Excerpts from the interview were carried in Thursday's
newspapers.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has been
negotiating between Israel and Lebanon for months on a possible
swap and both sides have said they are willing to make a deal.
	   Hezbollah has held out on the exchange, insisting that Israel
increase the number of prisoners it intends to free.
	   In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared less
confident that a deal was imminent.
	   Asked if there was progress in negotiations for the exchange of
prisoners, Netanyahu told reporters: ``I hope so, but it's hard to
say that it's a closed matter.''
	   ``To return our soldiers, even when they are not alive, is a
holy mission, and we are doing everything that needs to be done in
this matter,'' he added.
	   Nasrallah said, 6th graf pvs

Kashmir called source of newly nuclear India-Pakistan rivalry
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with protest meetings, CHANGES byline.

  By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The recent nuclear tests conducted by
neighboring rivals India and Pakistan have shifted the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir from being a bilateral dispute to one in which
western powers may want to mediate.
	   On Thursday, as leaders of the five original nuclear powers met
in Geneva to discuss disarmament and ways to find peace in Kashmir,
separatist leaders enforced a strike in Kashmir's capital,
Srinagar, saying the world finally is paying attention to their
problem.
	   ``This is a very serious problem,'' said Saifuddin Soz, a
Kashmiri lawmaker representing the National Conference Party that
has campaigned against separatism.
	   Just when the United States, Japan and other nations were
beginning to recognize India's stand that the militancy in the
state was being instigated by neighboring Pakistan, he said, ``the
bomb took us back to square one.''
	   ``Today's strike in Kashmir is qualitatively different from
those all these years,'' he said at a gathering of anti-nuclear
protesters in New Delhi, where he suggested that pro-independence
groups would once again become active in Kashmir.
	   But in Srinagar, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All Parties
Hurriyat Conference called the strike, said ``unless the issue (of
Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of the people under
international principles, peace will not return to the Indian
subcontinent.''
	   The Hurriyat is an umbrella group of 32 pro-independence groups
that want Indian-held Kashmir to break away from India, either to
form an independent country or join Pakistan.
	   India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training
anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only
moral support.
	   On Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee rejected
any offer to negotiate in the Kashmir dispute. He said he has yet
to hear from Pakistan that both nations hold talks to resolve their
longstanding dispute, he told Parliament during a debate.
	   Kashmir, a Muslim majority area was ruled by a Hindu king when
British colonialists carved out India and Pakistan in 1947. The
ruler decided to stay with India. Although Muslims are in a
majority in Kashmir, they account for only 12 percent of India's
almost 1 billion population nationwide.
	   Both nations have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.
One-third of the territory is held by Pakistan, the rest by India.
	   Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be
addressed in an international forum, while India insists it remain
a bilateral issue. Now, India fears the Geneva talks will focus on
Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of
Economics' Asia Research Center.
	   India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while
Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a
disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
	   Vajpayee also told Parliament that India would welcome any
international initiative on global disarmament, but said focusing
on South Asia alone was unfair.
	   Vajpayee also said India and Pakistan were under ``unwarranted''
pressure to sign a global test ban treaty. India has long spurned
both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they do not force Britain, China,
France, Russia and the U.S. to give up their nuclear arsenals.

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station docked Thursday with
the U.S. space shuttle Discovery, which was sent to pick up
astronaut Andrew Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on
Mir.
	   The docking appeared to go flawlessly, and was greeted by
applause at Mission Control just outside Moscow.
	   Earlier, space officials had said Mir was in ``perfect order''
and ready to relay TV pictures of its rendezvous with Discovery,
whose communications system is out of order.
	   ``You will have the exclusive rights for TV coverage,'' a ground
controller joked while telling Mir's crew about Discovery's
problem.
	   Discovery hooked up with Mir precisely on schedule at 9 p.m.
Moscow time (1700 GMT) and is to remain linked to the station for
four days.
	   Because of a failure of an antenna in Discovery's communication
system, live images of the docking and the meeting of two crews
came only from Mir's cameras, said Russian Mission Control
spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova.
	   Mir has been running smoothly since Monday, when cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin fixed a three-day computer
breakdown which disabled the station's steering system and
threatened to delay the docking.
	   ``All the station's systems are now in perfect order,''
Medvedkova told The Associated Press. ``We are fully ready for the
docking.''
	   Mir's main computer failed on Saturday, leaving the station
unstable and its energy supply in jeopardy if its solar panels lost
their alignment with the sun.
	   Computer breakdowns plagued the aging space outpost all through
1997, and the previous shuttle ferry flight in January brought a
new computer which had worked trouble-free until Saturday's
failure. The crew used another back-up computer and other spares to
fix the problem.
	   Medvedkova said the crew woke up three hours later than usual
Thursday to adjust their schedule to that of Discovery. They spent
the time before the docking packing science gear used by Thomas and
his six NASA predecessors.

The frustrating case of the fraudulent -- but free -- banker

<TEXT>
moved the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) parliamentary
delegation Wednesday to formally request the expedition of legal
reforms that would stiffen penalties for financial and banking
crimes.
	   PRI Deputy Francisco Loyo Ramos presented an Excitativa to the
Permanent Commission asking the Chamber of Deputies' Finance and
Justice Committees to accelerate their review of the initiatives,
proposed by President Ernesto Zedillo in late April.
	   ``These initiatives will change the current public opinion that
the punishments for financial and banking crimes are tainted by
impunity and corruption,'' said Ramos.
	   The legislator's request comes in response to the nationwide
uproar over Angel ``El Divino'' Rodriguez, the former owner of
Banpais charged with making 400 million dollars in bad loans.
	   After a two-year extradition process in Spain, ``El Divino''
arrived in Mexico on Monday but was immediately set free when his
lawyer filed an amparo, or injunction, preventing his imprisonment.
	   The initiatives in the Chamber would extend the period in which
financial crimes could be prosecuted, increase prison sentences
and, most importantly, classify white-collar crimes as ``serious''
in the nation's Penal Code.
	   They would not, however, affect the amparo law, which has been
frequently used by white-collar criminals like ``El Divino'' or
fellow banker Jorge Lankenau to avoid jail time.
	   CRIMES AGAINST WOMENThe Permanent Commission, a skeleton
Congress that meets once a week when the full Congress is out of
session, also turned its attention to Ciudad Juarez, where the
murder of 130 women since 1993 has slowly developed into a matter
of national concern.
	   The legislators unanimously passed a Point of Agreement that
``repudiated'' the murders and ``condemned'' all violence against
women.
	   Many of the 130 victims were workers at maquiladoras --
factories that sprang up along the Mexico-U.S. border due to NAFTA
-- and were raped or beaten before they were killed.
	   PRI Deputy Marlene Herrera Diaz said the crime wave in Juarez is
``unprecedented.''''The authorities responsible for imparting
justice have proved themselves to be incapable, negligent, and
misogynistic,'' she said.
	   PRD Deputy Laura Itzel Castillo also criticized the police
authorities in Juarez and Chihuahua.
	   ``What is needed is a real response to reach a solution to the
series of problems causing the murders,'' said Castillo.

Heads of state celebrate Switzerland's 150th anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Heads of state of Switzerland's
neighbors and other dignitaries converged on the picturesque Swiss
capital Thursday to celebrate 150 years of this small alpine
country in its present form.
	   At a ceremony in the Swiss federal parliament's lower house,
presidents and others including Britain's Princess Anne praised
neutral Switzerland for its humanitarian tradition.
	   Switzerland's current confederation was formed in 1848, the year
revolution broke out across Europe. Its 26 cantons (states) have
wide-ranging powers.
	   Despite the celebratory atmosphere, Swiss President Flavio Cotti
used the occasion to acknowledge that Switzerland's behavior during
World War II wasn't faultless.
	   But the great majority of the wartime generation defended the
country's values in the face of grave threats, he said.
	   Cotti also praised moves toward closer European integration _ a
process that Switzerland has largely been left out of.
	   The Swiss electorate voted against joining a loose European free
trade grouping five years ago.
	   Fearful of another snub at the ballot box, the government has
frozen an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation
European Union, which surrounds the country.
	   But many politicians, including Cotti, argue it would be better
to influence decisions from inside by joining the EU.
	   German President Roman Herzog said Europe should attempt ``to
become more Swiss _ in other words, more federal, more transparent
and more democratic.''
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said the EU would welcome
Switzerland ``with open arms.''
	   The United Nations _ which Switzerland is also not a member of,
although it hosts the organization's European headquarters _ was
represented by Louise Frechette, its deputy secretary-general.

Hezbollah attack in south Lebanon wounds Israeli soldier
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah announcing death of fighter. No pickup  

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in
southern Lebanon early Thursday as a convoy of Israeli armored
vehicles was passing, wounding an Israeli soldier, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   The attack came hours after the leader of the militant guerrilla
group, Hezbollah, hinted that he may order rocket attacks on
Israel, which would breach the April 1996 understanding on avoiding
civilian casualties in the southern Lebanon conflict.
	   The pre-dawn bombing occurred near the village of Haddatha, on
the northern edge of the Israeli-occupied zone and 22 kilometers
(15 miles) southeast of the port of Tyre, said security officials,
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said a soldier was
moderately wounded by the explosions.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said guerrillas attacked
Israeli forces with ``appropriate weapons,'' scoring ``direct
hits,'' near Haddatha at 2 a.m. (2300GMT Wednesday) Haddatha is on
the northern edge of the occupied enclave, about 10 kilometers (six
miles) north of Israel's northern border.
	   In another attack Thursday morning, Hezbollah guerrillas said
they fired rockets and machine guns at an Israeli outpost at Sojod,
some 35 kilometers (21 miles) northeast of Tyre, destroying
fortifications.
	   Security officials and the Israeli army did not comment on the
second attack.
	   Hezbollah on Thursday also announced the death of a fighter.
	   A statement issued by the group said Hassan Kassem, 32, who
joined the ranks of Hezbollah in 1984, died Wednesday. It did not
say how Kassem was killed.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war against
the 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied Lebanese militias in the
zone, which makes up 10 percent of Lebanon's territory.
	   Israel or its allies have controlled the border zone since 1978.
In 1985, the Israeli government established the zone in its present
form with the aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla attacks on
its northern towns.

Ukrainian newspaper loses court battle against interior minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - An opposition-minded Ukrainian newspaper
lost a libel battle against the country's interior minister
Thursday and was ordered to pay heavy damages for falsely accusing
him of corruption.
	   Officials of the newspaper, Kievskiye Vedomosti, said they would
appeal the verdict of a Kiev court.
	   ``In my opinion, this is a political action,'' editor in chief
Yevhen Yakunov said in an interview.
	   Foes of President Leonid Kuchma say he is trying to silence
opposition media. Alexander Vorobyov, the newspaper's court
representative, called on other media outlets to impose an
information boycott on the authorities.
	   ``Otherwise, within two to three months we would not have any
normal free press left,'' Vorobyov said. ``This is the only measure
that can stop this arbitrariness.''
	   Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko sued the daily following the
publication of a series of articles a year ago, in which Kievskiye
Vedomosti alleged that the minister had bought an expensive car
through a public fund set up to help bereaved families of policemen
killed in the line of duty.
	   The 205,000 German marks (dlrs 115,000) paid for the Mercedes
``were not used to assist the families of dead policemen but, in
essence, to fulfill the ambitions of Mr. Kravchenko,'' Kievskiye
Vedomosti insisted Thursday.
	   The Starokievsky district court, however, ruled that the
publication stained Kravchenko's dignity and honor, and ordered the
newspaper to pay him 5 million hryvna (dlrs 2.5 million) for the
damage.
	   It also ordered two journalists who wrote some of the articles
to pay 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 10,000) and 7,000 hryvna (dlrs 3,500),
respectively.
	   Ukrainian opposition media long have alleged a pattern of
harassment by the authorities.
	   Last month, Oleh Lyashko, editor in chief of the newspaper
Politika, said tax officials ``acting on an order from above'' had
blocked the paper's bank accounts.
	   Prior to legislative elections in March, the government ordered
a printing house to stop publishing the centrist opposition
newspaper Pravda Ukrainy, citing errors in re-registration papers.
	   Another centrist opposition newspaper, Vseukrainskiye Vedomosti,
has since halted publication after losing a 3.5 million hryvna
(dlrs 1.8 million) libel suit brought by a businessman and
politician.
	   European observers have questioned whether Ukraine was meeting
its obligation as a Council of Europe member to respect press
freedom.

Drug conference to focus on combating money-laundering, developing
</HEADLINE>
alternate crops  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Curbing money-laundering and reducing
narcotics demand will be among the main themes of a U.N. drug
conference which opens next week, the U.N.'s chief drug control
officer said Thursday.
	   President Clinton will open the three-day ``Special Session on
the World Drug Problem'' with a speech Monday to the U.N. General
Assembly. Representatives of about 150 governments, including 35
heads of state or government, are also expected to attend.
	   They include French President Jacques Chirac, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer and
President Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   ``For the first time, we have the issue of demand reduction
included at the same level as other components of narcotics
control,'' Pino Arlacchi, head of the U.N. drug control office,
said.
	   Arlacchi said demand reduction includes measures to rehabilitate
addicts, discourage young people from taking drugs and ``a strategy
for an elimination or substantial reduction'' in the cultivation of
cannabis, poppies and other narcotic crops over 10 years by
offering alternative crops to farmers.
	   He said the European Community should expand its programs for
drug rehabilitation and developing countries should establish
treatment programs.
	   ``We think that the time has come to include some important
elements of the money-laundering issue,'' he added. ``We are
concerned about bank secrecy as an impediment to criminal
investigations worldwide and about the proliferation of tax havens
worldwide ... that provide secure havens and protection'' for drug
profits.
	   Other issues on the agenda include control of legal chemicals
which can be synthesized into narcotics and cooperation among law
enforcement and courts worldwide.
	   The goal will be to encourage individual national governments to
enact legislation in line with conference guidelines.
	   But critics have questioned whether the United Nations is
capable of mounting an effective program and whether the conference
will endorse an American-style ``war on drugs,'' which has failed
to achieve success.
	   In a statement Thursday, the Catholic Institute for
International Relations warned that a strategy which emphasizes
``repressive anti-drugs policies'' and ignores the needs of poor
farmers is bound to fail.
	   Arlacchi said he had no intention of mounting a U.S.-style
``drug war'' on a global scale.
	   ``There is a kind of `U.S.-centric' vision of what is happening
in the world that should be overcome,'' Arlacchi said. ``I think
this is a wrong metaphor for every place.''
	   The United Nations estimates that two countries _ Myanmar and
Afghanistan _ account for 80 percent of the world's illicit poppy
production. The Islamic Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan, has agreed to let the United Nations begin monitoring
poppy cultivation in an attempt to discourage opium production.
	   Despite aggressive efforts to interdict drug shipments, the
United Nations estimates that law enforcement agencies would be
able to seize no more than 10 percent of heroin shipments and 30
percent of cocaine traffic worldwide.

Doorman comes forward as witness in Gucci trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A doorman gave some support Thursday to
prosecutors' claims that they have charged the proper person as the
hit man in the slaying of the scion of the Gucci fashion house.
	   While Giuseppe Onorato said he could not be 100 percent certain,
he testified that Benedetto Ceraulo bore a strong resemblance to
the man he saw firing at Maurizio Gucci on a Milan street.
	   Onorato had previously identified Ceraulo from a photograph.
	   Prosecutors asked Onorato to testify after another defendant
this week admitted he drove the getaway car but said police had
arrested the wrong hit man.
	   Maurizio Gucci was shot dead March 27, 1995, as he walked into
his office building in downtown Milan.
	   Nearly two years later, police arrested his ex-wife, Patrizia
Reggiani Martinelli; her longtime spiritual adviser, Giuseppina
Auriemma; Milan hotel doorman, Ivano Savioni; alleged trigger man,
Ceraulo; and Orazio Cicala, the confessed driver.
	   The prosecution says Reggiani Martinelli had Gucci killed
because she was obsessed with gaining control of his estate and he
would cut her alimony in half to dlrs 900,000 a year. She allegedly
paid her co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to carry out the killing.
	   Ceraulo stared at Onorato from the prisoners' cage as the latter
described watching the gunman fire four shots at Gucci and seeing
his body slump to the pavement.
	   Onorato testified Gucci stared at him in surprise like he was
asking ``What's happening?''

Newport Tennis Hall of Fame burning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Fire raged Thursday at the U.S.
Tennis Hall of Fame, which houses historic memorabilia from tennis
legends and is the site of the oldest grass court competitions in
the United States.
	   The four-alarm fire broke out at 11:20 a.m. (1520 GMT) in a
section of the three-story building farthest from the museum. It
spread to the Newport Casino, which houses the Hall of Fame's grass
courts.
	   There have been no reports of injuries and the extent of damage
to the museum and historic courts was unclear, fire officials said.
	   The building was rebuilt after much of it was destroyed in a
fire 10 years ago.

Russia hails success of bond issue as sign investor confidence

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia hailed the success Thursday of a surprise,
dlrs 1.25 billion fund-raising bond sale as a sign that foreign
investors were regaining confidence in its battered economy.
	   In another sign of optimism, the Central Bank slashed key
interest rates it jacked up last month to persuade investors to
stay in Russia.
	   The stock market closed only 0.22 percent lower Thursday, after
two days of rebounding from the tailspin that began two weeks ago.
The ruble was also slightly lower, at 6.17 to the dollar compared
with 6.16 on Wednesday.
	   Many analysts credit the stabilizing of the markets to rumors of
new lending from the International Monetary Fund or others to ease
the government's desperate cash flow problem.
	   ``Somebody is acting with a degree of confidence that hasn't
been seen in a long time,'' said Pat Rothstein, investment adviser
at Moscow brokerage Troika-Dialog.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his ministers insisted
Thursday the government was not formally seeking outside help.
	   ``Officially, officially, we didn't make any requests, not to
the International Monetary Fund, to the World Bank, nor for any
other extra help,'' said Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov.
	   Late Wednesday, Russia surprised markets by issuing dlrs 1.5
billion of bonds, which Zadornov said were snapped up within 15
minutes, mostly by U.S. investors.
	   He said the government planned to sell only dlrs 1 billion of
bonds, but raised the limit because of demand and could have sold
even more. That proves the ``investors' mood has changed,'' he
said.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin agreed.
	   ``The fact that foreign investors immediately bought Russian
securities even without the traditional advertising campaign
indicates that they are confident in Russia and believe in the
ability of the government to cope with recent difficulties in the
financial markets,'' he told the Interfax news agency.
	   After the market closed, the Central Bank slashed key interest
rates to 60 percent from 150 percent. The rates had been 50 percent
until last week when they were tripled in a bid to persuade
investors to stay in Russia.
	   Despite the optimistic government pronouncements, analysts say
some sort of bailout package is still likely since some Western
financial institutions, particularly German banks, have significant
stakes in the Russian market.
	   Zadornov said the government has received about 2 billion rubles
(dlrs 325,000) in tax arrears in recent days. When the turmoil
struck the markets, the government quickly summoned the nation's
biggest tax debtors to a meeting and told them to pay up.
	   President Boris Yeltsin also enlisted the help of 10 of Russia's
most powerful businessmen who are developing a joint plan to
address the country's severe economic troubles _ including the
chronic inability to collect taxes.
	   The Kremlin has blamed the market turmoil on several factors
including the Asian financial crisis, a recent coal miners' strike,
and even concerns about a recent Cabinet shakeup. Its biggest fear
was that the steep drop in the stock market would lead to a run on
the ruble, leading to price rises.

Deputies from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) met on

<TEXT>
Wednesday to map out a schedule for the passage of the financial
package sent to Congress by President Ernesto Zedillo, Notimex
reported.
	   Angel Aceves Saucedo, one of the PRI's leading deputies on
economic affairs, said the financial package should be ready to be
discussed in the Chamber and the Senate by June 25.
	   ``We cannot allow a legislative paralysis,'' Aceves said.
	   He added that Congress should convene a special session as soon
as the proposals are ready.
	   The work of the PRI deputies was a result of a Tuesday night
meeting between Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa and
congressional leaders of all represented parties.
	   Finance Secretary Jose Angel Gurria and Bank of Mexico President
Guillermo Ortiz also joined the meeting, which was held at the
Interior Secretariat.
	   Only two major accomplishments came out of the high-level
reunion --the fourth meeting so far between Labastida and a
legislative contingent.
	   The officials agreed to move the financial package -- including
the controversial Fobaproa bill -- through Congress as quickly as
possible.
	   They also agreed to meet Thursday to review the status of each
bill in the package -- the reason for Wednesday's meeting of PRI
deputies.
	   After the five-hour meeting, Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD) Deputy Ricardo Garcia Sainz read a statement urging the
Chamber of Deputies' Finance and Budget Committees to review the
proposals ``with the greatest brevity.''Although the Executive and
Legislative representatives specifically included the Fobaproa
proposal -- which would convert the 65 billion-dollar loss from a
bank-bailout fund into public debt -- it will likely not be passed
along with the rest of the package during a summer special session.
	   Opposition party legislators have insisted on conducting a full
audit of Fobaproa, as well as four banks (Bancrecer, Confia, Serfin
and Banpais) before making Mexican taxpayers foot the bill.
	   But PRI legislators, Aceves said, think the proposal can be
passed while the audits are being conducted.

Marco Pantani powers up hills to win stage and retain lead

  EDs: CORRECTS Pantani's time in 10th graf  

<TEXT>
	   PLAN DI MONTECAMPIONE, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani powered his
way up grueling mountain passes Thursday to clinch the 19th stage
of the Tour of Italy and increase his lead over rival Pavel Tonkov.
	   The 239-kilometer (148 mile) ride, under scorching sun, took its
toll on race favorite Alex Zuelle of Switzerland, who lost dozens
of positions after dominating the initial stages of this cycling
classic. Zuelle sits a whopping 32 minutes behind Pantani, the
overall leader.
	   Pantani, who captured the leader's pink jersey for the first
time in his career Tuesday, now holds a one-minute, 28-second lead
over Russia's Tonkov with three days to go.
	   The 1996 Giro winner, Tonkov is stronger than Pantani in the
time trials and could catch the Italian in the final time trial
Saturday.
	   ``I knew it was my last chance to make up time,'' said Pantani,
a climbing specialist. ``I tried my hardest and now we will see if
it was enough.''
	   The 22-stage Giro ends Sunday in Milan.
	   ``Marco was in great shape and I was, too, until the last
kilometers,'' Tonkov said. ``Then I had a small breakdown because
of so much sun and heat.''
	   The two rode side by side for much of the stage's final climb
through the Alps until about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) from the
finish line when Pantani broke away.
	   ``Victory is going to come down to seconds in the time trial,''
Pantani said. ``It will be very tough for both of us.''
	   The Italian completed Thursday's stage, the longest of the Tour,
in seven hours, 42.52 minutes.

Mexico City Attorney General Samuel del Villar praised police

<TEXT>
efforts Wednesday, saying 213 criminal organizations have been
eliminated since Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas took office Dec. 5. In
addition, Del Villar said 52 criminal ringleaders and more then
1,000 delinquents were detained. The Federal District Attorney
General's Office (PGJDF) made Wednesday's announcement following a
meeting between Cardenas and Public Safety Secretary Rodolfo
Debernardi at the mayor's office in the Zocalo.
	   Del Villar called on reforms to the penal code, but added that
existing laws made by the federal Congress (when Mexico City's
mayoral post was a part of the president's Cabinet) and the Federal
District Legislative Assembly have not completely impeded police
efforts to crack down on soaring crime. ``We have clearly shown
that it is absolutely indispensable to reform the existing laws,
but while they are still in force we are obliged to follow them. We
can only make a scratch on the surface of the city's crime with the
existing laws,'' Del Villar said.
	   The PGJDF is presently modernizing their data systems in order
to have access to more reliable information about the city's
criminal organizations.
	   Del Villar also said that the PGJDF is politically neutral as
concerns the application of its work.

President Ernesto Zedillo has created a National Committee for

<TEXT>
the Conversion of Data Processing for the Year 2000, the National
Statistics Institute (INEGI) announced Wednesday.
	   The body will try to address the millennium bug -- the so-called
Y2K computer meltdown.
	   Many computers register the current year in only two digits. For
example 1982 is shortened to 82.
	   Unless the date fields are changed to reflect the year 2000,
computers will interpret ``00'' as 1900 causing them to
misinterpret information.
	   The commission is charged with coordinating the activities of
organizations throughout the country that maintain computer systems
and data-processing components so they will be able to correctly
record changes to the year 2000.
	   The commission integrates government secretariats from areas
such as foreign relations, national defense, finance, energy,
trade, communications and transport, and education. The Bank of
Mexico governor and representatives of the private, academic, and
social sectors are all permanent members.
	   Carlos M. Jarque of INEGI will preside over the commission.
	   The federal government and the financial sector have already
taken actions to guarantee the continuity and best operation of its
services, INEGI said.
	   Zedillo said the administration has ranked the data processing
problem as a top priority as it has a practical impact on all human
activities such as the structures of production and
commercialization.
	   Since the beginning of last year, measures have been taken by
the federal government to convert data-processing components.
	   In the financial sector it signaled data-processing adjustments
of banks and brokerage houses will be finished, including proofs
corresponding to Dec. 31, 1998.
	   Jobs in this sector have been coordinated by the Bank of Mexico
and the National Banking Commission.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Leaders from the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation forum began gathering at a seaside resort Thursday for
a summit meant to formally turn the 11-nation group into a regional
economic organization.
	   The summit in Yalta began with a meeting of senior officials
from member countries, followed by a meeting among foreign
ministers and bilateral talks between heads of state.
	   On Friday, leaders of BSEC countries plan to sign the group's
charter and a joint declaration which the foreign ministers
approved Thursday. Ukrainian officials said it would state BSEC's
determination to promote peace and stability in the region.
	   ``The primary goal of the summit is the creation of a new
international organization ... for economic cooperation,'' said
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk.
	   Tarasyuk also spoke of forming a ``Euro-Black Sea economic
space'' and free trade zones in the region and attracting
international investors, which he said was the BSEC's ``supreme
task.''

  Hezbollah attack in south Lebanon wounds Israeli soldier
  Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with Hezbollah announcing death of
fighter

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated a roadside bomb in
southern Lebanon early Thursday, wounding an Israeli soldier,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The attack came hours after the leader of the militant guerrilla
group, Hezbollah, hinted he may order rocket attacks on Israel,
which would breach the April 1996 understanding on avoiding
civilian casualties in the southern Lebanon conflict.
	   The pre-dawn bombing took place near the village of Haddatha, on
the northern edge of the Israeli-occupied zone and 22 kilometers
(15 miles) southeast of the port of Tyre, said security officials,
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said a soldier was
moderately wounded by a bomb that exploded as a convoy of Israeli
armored vehicles was passing.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said guerrillas attacked
Israeli forces with ``appropriate weapons,'' scoring ``direct
hits,'' near Haddatha at 2 a.m. (2300GMT Wednesday)
	   In another attack Thursday morning, Hezbollah guerrillas said
they fired rockets and machine guns at an Israeli outpost at Sojod,
some 35 kilometers (21 miles) northeast of Tyre, destroying
fortifications.
	   Security officials and the Israeli army did not comment on the
second attack.
	   Hezbollah on Thursday also announced the death of one of its
fighters.
	   A statement issued by the group said Hassan Kassem, 32, who
joined the ranks of Hezbollah in 1984, died Wednesday. It did not
say how Kassem was killed.

Non-Orthodox Jews angry over resumption of conversion legislation
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK KATZENELL  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Non-Orthodox Jewish leaders expressed outrage
Thursday over the government's decision to revive a bill that would
formalize the Orthodox monopoly over conversions to Judaism.
	   The bill has raised an outcry among Jews in the United States
and other western countries, where the Reform and Conservative
movements have much larger followings than in Israel.
	   ``We are shocked that the Netanyahu government has taken a step
that will tear the Jewish people in Israel from the Jewish people
in the Diaspora,'' American Reform leader Rabbi Eric Yoffie said
Thursday.
	   The bill, which has already passed its first reading in the
Knesset, would institutionalize the status quo whereby Israel
recognizes only conversions carried out under the auspices of the
Orthodox chief rabbinate, and not those done by Reform and
Conservative rabbis.
	   The Reform and Conservative movements, which interpret Jewish
law less strictly than the Orthodox, have challenged that policy in
Israel's Supreme Court.
	   The bill does not affect conversions conducted by Reform and
Conservative rabbis overseas, which are recognized by the state.
	   In practice, the bill's chances of passing are considered slim,
since some members of the ruling Likud party say they will join the
opposition Labor and Meretz parties in voting against it.
	   But Rabbi Uri Regev, leader of Israel's Reform movement, said
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to revive the bill
will renew the crisis between Israel and overseas Jewry that flared
up when the bill was first introduced last year.
	   The decision ``will bring the state of Israel back to the path
of war against the Jewish people,'' Regev told The Associated
Press.
	   Rabbi Ehud Bandel, leader of Israel's Conservative movement,
said the bill is a message to non-Orthodox Jews that their form of
Judaism is not accepted by the Jewish state. ``Israel will be
telling us: we encourage you to come here, but leave your approach
to Judaism in the Diaspora,'' he said.
	   The bill will sabotage immigration to Israel and undermine the
overseas Jewish support for the state, Bandel said. `The government
is playing with fire.''
	   Although most Israeli Jews are not observant, the Orthodox
rabbinate has control over marriage, divorce and burial, as well as
conversions.
	   The conversion bill was introduced after the Reform and
Conservative movements asked the Supreme Court to order the
Interior Ministry to recognize conversions conducted by their
rabbis in Israel.
	   The Orthodox political parties threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if the prime minister did not propose
legislation ensuring the Orthodox monopoly over conversions.
	   The passage of the bill on its first reading last year raised
such an outcry from American Jews that the government set up a
committee headed by Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman to seek a
compromise.
	   The committee proposed setting up a joint conversion institute
in which Reform, Conservative and Orthodox rabbis would
participate, although the actual conversions would be conducted by
Orthodox rabbis.
	   But after the chief rabbinate refused to take part in the
institute, the Reform and Conservative movements revived their
court cases.
	   In response, Netanyahu this week ordered preparation of the
conversion bill for its second and final readings.
	   Orthodox legislator Rabbi Moshe Gafni accused Reform and
Conservative leaders of trying to import a watered-down version of
Judaism to Israel.
	   ``This leaves us no option but to pass the conversion law,
because that is the only way we can maintain the status quo and
prevent recognition by the state of the phony conversions in which
they are engaged,'' he said.

With the adoption of the International Safety Management (ISM)

<TEXT>
Code this year, much emphasis has been put in vessel safety and
pollution prevention at sea.
	   In line with this, the Association of Maritime Education and
Training Institutions in Asia Pacific (Ametiap) will have for its
theme, ``Education for Safer Ships and Cleaner Oceans'' for its
annual conference to be held in Shanghai, China this October.
	   Wenifredo Sola, director of the Magsaysay Institute of Shipping
(MIS) said: ``Our role is to provide education and training that
will assist the safe operation of vessels and the protection of the
oceans from damage as a result of shipping operations.''
	   Sola pointed out that when the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) was first established, the main concern then was
to evolve international machinery to improve safety at sea.
	   He noted that the first IMO conference in 1980 was concerned
with safety matters on Safety of Life at Sea (Solas).
	   Sola, however stressed that an enormous amount of work remains
to be done, including the provision of improved maritime education
and training.
	   ``It is up to us, the maritime educators, to take the initiative
in developing education and training services for the maritime
industry. With the establishment of Ametiap in 1987, members of the
maritime education and training in the international community have
already take a significant step along the path to achieving this,''
he said.
	   Ametiap, established in 1987, initially started with just seven
members from the Asia Pacific region, namely: Australia, China,
Hongkong, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and Singapore.
	   Now, the association has more than 15 members made up of various
maritime schools and training centers all over the region. MIS was
the first Philippine-based maritime institution to be admitted as
member of the association.
	   MIS, according to Sola, became a full-pledged Ametiap member
early last year during the associations' annual conference held in
Hongkong.
	   Since then, other maritime schools and training centers from the
Philippines have applied for membership in the association. Among
these are the Asian Institute of Maritime Studies (AIMS),
Philippine Seafarers Inc., and Admiral Maritime Training Center
Inc.
	   Sola claimed that this year's conference will gather the members
like Australian Maritime College, Dalian Maritime University, Far
Eastern State Maritime School, Hongkong Vocational Training
Council, Institute for Sea Training (Japan), New Zealand Maritime
School, Papua New Guinea Maritime School, Qingdao Ocean Shipping
College, Shanghai Maritime University, National Maritime Academy
(Singapore), Singapore Polytechnic College, South Metropolitan
College, Hongkong Polytechnic University, Tokyo University of
Mercantile, and Wuhan Transportation University.
	   The association's current executive committee members are
Australian Maritime College, Shanghai Maritime University, Hongkong
Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic and Tokyo University.

U.S. Air Force major arrested on smuggling charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force major was arrested
Thursday along with four Turks on charges of smuggling ancient
artifacts, police said.
	   Maj. Derek Fox, 42, was arrested after one of the Turks,
employed at Incirlik air base, tried to sell artifacts to
undercover police posing as buyers. The hometown of Fox was not
immediately available.
	   Fox appeared before a judge who ordered him to stand trial,
police said. The major was jailed, and no trial date was
immediately set, police added.
	   Fox, a computer technician at the base, was allegedly
responsible for smuggling the goods to the United States, according
to police.
	   Police also seized 276 pieces such as silver and bronze coins,
seals, ancient documents and earthenware.
	   No one was available at the base for comment. A U.S. Embassy
spokesman would only confirm that a U.S. citizen working at
Incirlik is under investigation.
	   Incirlik, near the southern town of Adana, is the base for
``Operation Northern Watch,'' which patrols the no-fly zone north
of the 36th parallel in northern Iraq and monitors Iraq's treatment
of Kurds there. More than 45 U.S. and British planes and 1,400
personnel are part of the mission.

Belarus moves to outlaw insults against authoritarian president
</HEADLINE>

UPDATE with reax from opposition.  

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Parliament moved Thursday to make it a
crime to insult President Alexander Lukashenko, who is the frequent
target of scorn at anti-government demonstrations.
	   The lower house of parliament gave preliminary approval to a
bill creating a new crime of slandering or insulting the dignity of
the president.
	   The bill, which passed 64-2 on its first reading, sets penalties
of four years in prison or two years of labor for insulting the
president. Lukashenko heads a Soviet-style government that has been
harsh on dissenters.
	   ``Encroachment on the honor and dignity of this person causes
damage not only for him but for the image of the whole nation,''
said Mikhail Myasnikovich, chief of the presidential
administration.
	   But a prominent opposition figure, Valery Tikhinya, former
chairman of the Constitutional Court, criticized the bill, saying
it was intended as ``a weapon for pursuing dissidents.''
	   Protesters who insult Lukashenko are frequently arrested, but
until now they were charged with the lesser crime of violating
public order.
	   Before it becomes law, the bill must be approved a second time,
passed by the upper house of parliament, signed by the president
and published.

U.S. citizens get first new Mexican nationality certificates

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Nobel laureate from MIT, a nun from
Indonesia and a broadcaster from Chicago, all Mexicans by birth,
regained their original nationality on Thursday without sacrificing
their foreign citizenship.
	   In a ceremony at the National Palace, President Ernesto Zedillo
presented the first 12 certificates of nationality under a law
approved in March which allows people to hold citizenship abroad
without losing Mexican nationality.
	   ``Mexicans: Welcome to your country,'' Zedillo told more than
100 people gathered for the ceremony. ``For many Mexicans abroad,
this was the dream that for many years seemed impossible.''
	   First in line was Mario Molina of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He expressed a dream of recovering his Mexican
nationality in his speech accepting the 1995 Nobel Prize for
chemistry.
	   ``Promise fulfilled, Dr. Molina,'' said Zedillo as he handed
over the document.
	   Molina expressed ``great satisfaction'' at once again holding
nationality of ``this native land that gave me so much.'' He
promised to set up a team to study ways of solving Mexico City's
smog problems.
	   ``I'm a ball of nerves,'' Jose E. Chapa, a pioneer
Spanish-language broadcaster from Chicago, told reporters before
the ceremony.
	   As he took the certificate from Zedillo, he said regaining
Mexican nationality ``is like being born again.''
	   Chapa, 78, moved to the United States 45 years ago but took U.S.
citizenship only nine years ago because he was encouraging Latino
citizens to vote and thought he should do so as well.
	   ``Many Mexicans say, `I will not become a U.S. citizen in order
to not betray Mexico,''' he said. ``Now they have a free
conscience.''
	   Some Mexican officials said during debate on the measure that it
would eliminate concerns of longtime U.S. residents so they could
take up citizenship and participating in politics there.
	   The law eliminates the loss of Mexican inheritance and property
rights that previously faced those taking foreign citizenship.
	   However nationals who are not citizens cannot vote, serve in the
armed forces, hold most public offices or work aboard
Mexican-flagged ships or airlines.
	   Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said that through May 31, the
government received 3,738 nationality applications, the large
majority filed in the United States.
	   Among those receiving certificates Thursday were Allan Olvera
Rivero, who slept at the door of the Foreign Secretariat in order
to become the first person to apply, Indonesian nun Celina Gomez
Villarruel and Margie A. Emmarman, an adviser to Arizona Governor
Jane Hull.

Iraq says it is not hiding illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS throughout with Richardson saying UN proved its case
that Iraq still hiding banned weapons  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Following a briefing by U.N. inspectors to
the Security Council, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday that Iraq
is deceiving the United Nations about its weapons programs and
``this must stop'' if Baghdad expects to see sanctions lifted.
	   ``What was presented here was very sobering, very disturbing''
Ambassador Bill Richardson told reporters. He said that although
Iraq had destroyed Soviet-supplied long-range missiles, the
inspectors provided evidence that the Iraqis tested and deployed
locally manufactured missiles.
	   ``This is extremely serious,'' Richardson said. ``Indeed, Iraq
will not show (the inspectors) even one remnant of these supposedly
secretly destroyed missiles.''
	   British Ambassador John Weston said the briefings by Russian,
French, German, Australian and Argentine officials showed Iraq had
not yet met conditions for ending sanctions.
	   In Baghdad, a senior Iraqi official insisted Iraq was is not
hiding illegal weapons. ``If they have information (about weapons),
let them give it to us,'' Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed
Rashid, told The Associated Press. ``We will verify it.''
	   He said the chief U.N. inspector, Richard Butler, was trying to
raise doubts among council members ``to block the lifting of
sanctions.''
	   The Security Council met Thursday for a second straight day to
hear Butler report on the arms inspection program. Butler was
expected to speak about Iraq's alleged secret program to hide
weapons and illegal materials.
	   During the two-day briefing, Butler presented aerial photographs
and other documents to justify his claims that Iraq has failed to
comply with U.N. orders, issued after the 1991 Gulf War, to destroy
all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons.
	   France is urging him to outline what steps Iraq must take before
the council can lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the
Gulf War.
	   Butler hopes to convince the council that Iraq is wrong when it
claims to have complied with U.N. orders. Russia, China and France
have challenged some of Butler's conclusions.
	   Emerging from the meeting, Richardson said Butler and his staff
made clear that Iraq may still be hiding biological weapons, VX
nerve agents and playing ``hide and seek'' with the inspectors.
	   ``Iraq is deceiving (the inspectors) and it is deceiving the
Security Council,'' he added. ``This must stop if it expects to get
sanctions lifted.''
	   Richardson said there may have been progress in granting access
to inspectors and in dismantling its Iraqi nuclear weapons program.
But he said there was ``a very serious lack of information'' in the
missile, chemical and biological weapons areas.
	   ``We believe Iraq still represents a threat to its neighbors and
this is why it should be contained,'' he said.
	   Pressure has mounted on Butler since Secretary-General Kofi
Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open Saddam's
palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access _ but also increased the pressure on the inspectors to
declare Iraq free or weapons, or prove it is not.

The Philippine year-on-year consumer inflation is projected to

<TEXT>
have risen 8.5% in May, up from 7.9% in April, a Reuters poll of
seven economists completed on Wednesday said.
	   The projected inflation is more than double the 4.2% rise
registered in May 1997.
	   The latest inflation figure is scheduled for release on Friday.
	   ``It's not yet a sign that we're entering the phase of
hyperinflation. But I guess the government should closely monitor
the prices. We are bumping into the (full-year) target range
already,'' Ces Tanchoco, chief economist of Bank of the Philippine
Islands said.
	   Government has promised to keep inflation between 7.5% and 8.5%
for the year. In the first four months of the year, inflation
averaged 7.3%.
	   Economists attributed the rise in the consumer price index (CPI)
to higher food prices, triggered by tighter supply and accelerated
spending last month.
	   Drought in much of the country has severely affected food
production, while there was heavy spending by politicians to woo
voters ahead of the May 11 elections.
	   ``Election activities...only aggravated already existing
inflationary pressures,'' Marjo Elevado, senior research associate
of the Bankers Association of the Philippines Policy Research Group
said.
	   It was further exacerbated by higher fuel prices, Lito Dalit,
economist at United Coconut Planters Bank, added.
	   The Energy Regulatory Board raised the wholesale prices of three
oil products in middle of May due to the higher landed crude cost
and weaker peso-dollar exchange rate.
	   Dalit also said non-food prices have also risen, specially
education and clothing costs ahead of the opening of the new school
year this month.
	   ``It's not yet alarming, but there is a threat that inflation
will continue to pick up,'' he said.
	   Christine Tang, economist at Amsteel Securities, agreed, saying
it would be unlikely for the month-on-month inflation to slow in
the coming months given the rising trend of prices.
	   Emma Pante, economist of Far East Bank and Trust Co., said the
inflationary pressure could easily be addressed since it was
largely due to supply constraints.
	   ``This is just a supply side pressure. It's easier to manage. It
would have been at double digits if BSP (Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas) did not do a good job on the demand side,'' she said.
	   The following are the projections made by the different
institutions:
	   Amsteel Securities 8.5
	   Anscor Hagedorn Securities 8.0 - 8.5
	   BAP Policy Research Group 8.5 - 8.9
	   Bank of Phil. Islands 8.5 - 8.9
	   Capitol Securities One 8.2 - 8.4
	   Far East Bank 8.4 - 8.6
	   UCPB 8.8
	   Average: 8.5

Hopes for an Arab summit fade as Egypt, Syria express reservations
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Yemen-Arafat

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Hopes for holding an Arab summit on the
stalled Middle East peace talks faded Thursday after Egypt and
Syria expressed doubts about its outcome.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been pushing for the
conference in a bid to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13 percent
pullback in the West Bank.
	   ``There is no urgency to hold a summit. It will be held if the
peace process is frozen,'' said Osama el-Baz, the chief political
advisor of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   ``The summit is not on the table... what is important is its
contents and its objectives,'' said el-Baz who usually reflects the
Egyptian leader's opinion in foreign policies.
	   His statement came a day after Syria said such a meeting is
unnecessary since some Arab countries are unwilling to implement
resolutions of past summits urging cutting ties with Israel.
	   ``We are not in need of a new summit in as much as we are in
need of an explicit stance and policy which makes the wrong doers
go back to their blunder,'' said a commentary by the state-run
Syrian Arab News Agency.
	   Arafat is on an Arab tour to garner support for the summit so he
can forge an Arab strategy in case the peace talks collapse.
	   His insistence on the meeting reflects his frustration with U.S.
mediation, which has failed to convince Netanyahu to make the 13
percent withdrawal from the West Bank. Arafat, who wanted 30
percent, has accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   He wants the summit to clearly blame Israel for the stalemate in
the negotiations. Israel-Palestinian talks have been stalled since
March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing project in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Most Arab leaders have agreed to holding such a summit, but are

stance against Israel and others espousing a more moderate line.
	   But Jordan's King Hussein is believed to be reluctant to attend
a conference in Syria, where he expects Assad to push for a
hard-line stance against Israel.

summit to suspend ties with the Jewish state if progress was not
made toward peace. Jordan, the strongest advocate of peace with
Israel opposes that.
	   The United States has reportedly asked the Arab leaders to
postpone the proposed Arab summit on the faltering arguing that it
needs more time to convince Netanyahu to accept its suggestions.

  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	     ___
	   The Belfast Telegraph, Belfast, Northern Ireland, on Sinn Fein:
	   In any other part of the world, a garden party would be the most
innocuous of occasions on the summer calendar. But not so in
Northern Ireland, as the Secretary of State has found, presumably
not to her surprise. Her debatable decision to include Sinn Fein
representatives on the guest list for Hillsborough Castle on
Wednesday has backfired. An afternoon of embarrassment for all
concerned has only been averted by Sinn Fein's decision to boycott
the event.
	   The reason cited by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness is that
the guest of honor on Wednesday is to be Prince Charles. As
Colonel-in-Chief of the Parachute Regiment, he is still a hate
figure for republicans, so much so that the IRA once plotted his
murder. Even 26 years on from Bloody Sunday, the role of the
Parachute Regiment in the shootings has not been forgotten, let
alone forgiven.
	   It is a strange irony that while Sinn Fein is still keeping the
score, the republican movement now expects the wider community to
`forgive and forget' as far as the prisoners are concerned. It is
insisting on the early release of terrorist inmates, even though
the IRA has yet to issue any statement of contrition for all of its
heinous misdeeds _ including the murder of Earl Mountbatten, the
Prince of Wales's uncle. As Sinn Fein is fond of saying, nobody has
a monopoly on grief. ...
	     ___
	   Tages-Anzeiger, Zurich, on U.S. report about Nazi gold:
	   How good it is to hear that we were not the only country in the
neutral group that deviated from the path of virtue into the jungle
of opportunism.
	   And how good also to see remarks on the positive achievements of
Switzerland during the war!
	   And all this from the pen of Stuart Eizenstat, who last year in
his initial report mercilessly called Switzerland to account.
	   Why the new tone?
	   Neutrality is a naturally alien, and therefore suspect, maxim to
the thinking of the representatives of a great power.
	   But the longer the Eizenstat team's historians spent dealing
with the subject, the more conscious they obviously became of its
complexity, and their judgment of it became consequently more
rounded. ...
	     ___
	   Il Tempo, Rome, on Italian constitutional reforms:
	   By failing to make the constitutional reforms it was created
for, the constitutional commission has blocked justice. This is a
serious loss if we think about its initial intentions.
	   We have an old constitution, incompatible with new laws: let's
say it, incompatible with the spirit of the times.
	   But the worst of it is that as it is now interpreted, this
constitution has rendered every serious reform project impossible
because it is based on rigid principles that are founded on the
paternalistic axiom that the state governs the people, while in the
liberal philosophy, which everyone says we should aspire to, the
state is at the service of the citizen.
	   We start asking ourselves if maybe it is time to give the
sovereign voice to the citizens, redesigning a new constitution in
line with other European ones. A constitution that begins by
defining the republic no longer as founded on labor, but on
liberty.
	     ___
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on nuclear tests by India and Pakistan:
	   What (India and Pakistan) should calmly consider is the fact
that trying to become nuclear powers threatens their own security.
They both conducted nuclear tests with each other in mind as
targets in order to raise national prestige.
	   Considering the geopolitical factors of the two nations and the
characteristics of nuclear weapons, it would be almost a fantasy to
think nuclear arms would serve as military deterrents.
	   Rather, the two nations will likely be tormented by anxiety that
one may attack the other, considering the dispute over Kashmir and
the lack of a system to detect nuclear weapons.
	   India and Pakistan have put their own security under the Sword
of Damocles by entering a race over nuclear deployment.
	   They both should immediately withdraw from the nuclear path and
begin work to build confidence for improving South Asian security.
	   For its part, the international community should become actively
involved to build confidence between India and Pakistan. For
instance, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan should mediate to set
up a meeting between the two nations. And steps should be taken to
solve the dispute over Kashmir, which has led to a series of
military clashes between India and Pakistan.
	     ___
	   Buenos Aires Herald, Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Democracy in
South America:
	   Whither Democracy?
	   Sunday's elections in Colombia and Ecuador furnish further proof
that democracy is still alive and well in South America towards the
end of the second decade since its return ... yet the subject of
this editorial is not so much the candidates as the voter. Latin
American democracy today suffers from a paradoxical dualism _
increasingly entrenched as time goes by, it is also increasingly
disenchanting to the citizenry. One prime reason is exactly what
has been happening here in Argentina for most of this year _ even
more relentlessly than with the World Cup; everything seems to take
second place to (Argentine presidential) elections still well over
a year away while common sense in public life seems subordinated to
electioneering and populism. While the United States and European
countries are constantly telling Latin America that democracy and
the free market go hand in hand ... many Latin Americans cannot
help suspect that democracy is the antithesis of the normal working
of a free economy, given the constant electoral interference.

  RETRANSMITTING to restore BC designator

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Hopes for holding an Arab summit on the
stalled Middle East peace talks faded Thursday after Egypt and
Syria expressed doubts about its outcome.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been pushing for the
conference in a bid to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13 percent
pullback in the West Bank.
	   ``There is no urgency to hold a summit. It will be held if the
peace process is frozen,'' said Osama el-Baz, the chief political
advisor of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   ``The summit is not on the table... what is important is its
contents and its objectives,'' said el-Baz who usually reflects the
Egyptian leader's opinion in foreign policies.
	   His statement came a day after Syria said such a meeting is
unnecessary since some Arab countries are unwilling to implement
resolutions of past summits urging cutting ties with Israel.
	   ``We are not in need of a new summit in as much as we are in
need of an explicit stance and policy which makes the wrong doers
go back to their blunder,'' said a commentary by the state-run
Syrian Arab News Agency.
	   Arafat is on an Arab tour to garner support for the summit so he
can forge an Arab strategy in case the peace talks collapse.
	   His insistence on the meeting reflects his frustration with U.S.
mediation, which has failed to convince Netanyahu to make the 13
percent withdrawal from the West Bank. Arafat, who wanted 30
percent, has accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   He wants the summit to clearly blame Israel for the stalemate in
the negotiations. Israel-Palestinian talks have been stalled since
March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing project in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Most Arab leaders have agreed to holding such a summit, but are
torn by their usual squabbles between those wanting a hard-line
stance against Israel and others espousing a more moderate line.
	   But Jordan's King Hussein is believed to be reluctant to attend
a conference in Syria, where he expects Assad to push for a
hard-line stance against Israel.
	   Syria has been calling to activate a resolution by the 1996 Arab

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Lebanon-Syria:
	   French President Jacques Chirac's official visit to Lebanon gave
expression once again to the future of the country as well as the
prospects of peace on the Lebanese and Syrian fronts. It was like a
breath of fresh air to hear President Chirac tell the Lebanese,
Syrians and Israelis that Israel must withdraw unconditionally from
south Lebanon, and the occupied Golan Heights.
	   With Washington's credibility and clout being eroded by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's open defiance of President Bill
Clinton's stance on the peace process, it is now up to other major
capitals to stand up to Israel and put an end to its arrogance and
utter disregard to the wishes of the international community.
	   France has opened the door for such a clear-minded position, and
it is now the responsibility of other major countries to follow in
its footsteps. We hope that the other European capitals, especially
London, will follow suit and put more pressure on Netanyahu.
	     ___
	   Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, on Ireland:
	   Ireland finally said yes to settling ancient hatreds by
democratic process instead of by the gun. A stunning 81 percent of
registered voters in the North turned out; 71 percent approved the
peace agreement on Northern Ireland.
	   Power-sharing between Protestants and Catholics in the North is
likely to be messy and fitful. That's the nature of democracy. But
every advance is a heartening step toward peace.
	   The May 22 vote gives Ireland a chance to start fresh from this
day forward. The Republic has shown the North that a society at
peace with itself can bring prosperity. That's worth the price of
political power-sharing.
	     ___
	   Journal Star, Peoria, Illinois, on nuclear test ban treaty:
	   The first response to Pakistan's nuclear tit-for-tat is the one
Congress has mandated. President Bill Clinton will impose the same
economic sanctions against Pakistan that he placed on India after
its own nuclear explosions two weeks ago.
	   It's the next steps that are tough:
	   How to keep China from flexing its own nuclear muscles?
	   How to convince India not to test again?
	   When to lift the sanctions? (The law does not specify.)
	   How to persuade Congress that the threat of an arms race in Asia
is an argument for signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and
not against?
	   Of all of these issues, the last one is most important. Since
the Nixon presidency, the world has moved significantly to diffuse
the possibility that it might blow itself up. The nuclear testing
by India and Pakistan, long-time enemies, is the longest step
backward taken in at least four decades. That makes it all the more
important that the United States, the world's only superpower, move
the momentum forward again. ...
	     ___
	   The Post and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina, on President
Bill Clinton's cooperation with Kenneth Starr's investigation:
	   President Bill Clinton, responding to allegations that he
committed and suborned perjury, assured Americans that they would
have answers ``sooner rather than later.'' That was Jan. 23.
	   Here's what he said then: ``We are working very hard to comply,
get all the requests for information up here. ... And that's not a
dodge.''
	   But in the more than four months since he issued that assurance,
the president has resorted to unprecedented attempts to ``dodge''
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. ...
	   And the White House spin squad's relentless attacks on Starr,
while successful in boosting Clinton's poll numbers for the short
term, can't alter an essential long-term question: Did the
president break the law? ...
	   And the most essential question: Has the president's
credibility, overburdened by the cumulative weight of numerous,
widening scandals and his unseemly stonewalling, sunk so low that
he can no longer effectively lead the nation _ and the world?

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two unidentified assailants armed with
hammers badly injured a top Ukrainian regional tax official,
smashing his hands and breaking his skull, the tax service said
Thursday.
	   It said Olexander Manushin was attacked Wednesday in the eastern
city of Pavlohrad.
	   Manushin has recently been checking the records of several coal
and metal companies and has exposed tax violations amounting to
more than 1 million hryvna (dlrs 500,000), said the tax service
statement, cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   The attack on Manushin was an ``impudent challenge to the state
authorities'' and the assailants apparently meant to permanently
disable him, it said.
	   The tax service said there have been 225 crimes committed
against its workers over the past several years, including six
killings as well as numerous beatings and arson attacks.

Russia hails success of bond issue as sign investor confidence
</HEADLINE>
back  
  Eds: SUBS 8th graf to CORRECT that bond issue was for 1.25 billion
dollars.  
  By LESLIE SHEPHERD  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia hailed the success Thursday of a surprise,
dlrs 1.25 billion fund-raising bond sale as a sign that foreign
investors were regaining confidence in its battered economy.
	   In another sign of optimism, the Central Bank slashed key
interest rates it jacked up last month to persuade investors to
stay in Russia.
	   The stock market closed only 0.22 percent lower Thursday, after
two days of rebounding from the tailspin that began two weeks ago.
The ruble was also slightly lower, at 6.17 to the dollar compared
with 6.16 on Wednesday.
	   Many analysts credit the stabilizing of the markets to rumors of
new lending from the International Monetary Fund or others to ease
the government's desperate cash flow problem.
	   ``Somebody is acting with a degree of confidence that hasn't
been seen in a long time,'' said Pat Rothstein, investment adviser
at Moscow brokerage Troika-Dialog.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his ministers insisted
Thursday the government was not formally seeking outside help.
	   ``Officially, officially, we didn't make any requests, not to
the International Monetary Fund, to the World Bank, nor for any
other extra help,'' said Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov.
	   Late Wednesday, Russia surprised markets by issuing dlrs 1.25
billion of bonds, which Zadornov said were snapped up within 15
minutes, mostly by U.S. investors.
	   He said the government planned to sell only dlrs 1 billion of
bonds, but raised the limit because of demand and could have sold
even more. That proves the ``investors' mood has changed,'' he
said.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin agreed.
	   ``The fact that foreign investors immediately bought Russian
securities even without the traditional advertising campaign
indicates that they are confident in Russia and believe in the
ability of the government to cope with recent difficulties in the
financial markets,'' he told the Interfax news agency.
	   After the market closed, the Central Bank slashed key interest
rates to 60 percent from 150 percent. The rates had been 50 percent
until last week when they were tripled in a bid to persuade
investors to stay in Russia.
	   Despite the optimistic government pronouncements, analysts say
some sort of bailout package is still likely since some Western
financial institutions, particularly German banks, have significant
stakes in the Russian market.
	   Zadornov said the government has received about 2 billion rubles
(dlrs 325,000) in tax arrears in recent days. When the turmoil
struck the markets, the government quickly summoned the nation's
biggest tax debtors to a meeting and told them to pay up.
	   President Boris Yeltsin also enlisted the help of 10 of Russia's
most powerful businessmen who are developing a joint plan to
address the country's severe economic troubles _ including the
chronic inability to collect taxes.
	   The Kremlin has blamed the market turmoil on several factors
including the Asian financial crisis, a recent coal miners' strike,
and even concerns about a recent Cabinet shakeup. Its biggest fear
was that the steep drop in the stock market would lead to a run on
the ruble, leading to price rises.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews expecting to find more
bodies labored to disentangle a high-speed train from the wreckage
of a bridge Thursday, while speculation about the cause of
Germany's worst post-war rail disaster extended several kilometers
(miles) down the line.
	   At least 100 people died, according to Lower Saxony state
officials, when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 crashed and
broke apart at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning
in Eschede, a small town 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   By Thursday afternoon, 90 bodies had been recovered at the scene
and three people had died in hospitals. State officials said 200
people were injured, of whom 95 were treated in hospitals.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,''
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people who gathered
Thursday evening for a memorial service at the town's Lutheran
church, the Johanniskirche.
	   Officials were at a loss to explain how the accident occurred,
and said a detailed, forensic investigation would begin only after
all of the victims had been removed the debris. Workers hammered
away at the arching ruins of the overpass to reach a first-class
car and a dining car _ the last two to be excavated.
	   Among the many unanswered questions: Where and when the lead
locomotive broke loose from the rest of the train, and whether the
derailment was caused by the decoupling, a problem with the rails
or above on the overpass.
	   A spokeswoman for the federal transport ministry told The
Associated Press that a broken wheel on the first car behind the
lead locomotive may have been a factor. She did not elaborate.
	   The weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper reported Thursday that
experts from the federal railroad office found indications that one
of the coaches derailed about six kilometers (3.7 miles) south of
the overpass.
	   The coach was dragged along the rail bed until it came to a
turnout near the overpass where it swung sideways, hitting concrete
pillars, the newspaper said.
	   Spokesmen for the emergency teams said they had no information
on the report, and the federal railway office had no comment.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.
	   Officials said it appeared that the fifth car of the 12-car
train hit the bridge. The back end of the car was broken off; the
fourth car veered off the rails and rolled onto it side, while
three other cars jackknifed further up the line.
	   The lead locomotive remained on the tracks and the driver
apparently was unaware of the incident, coming to a stop only after
the station master at Eschede activated an emergency brake.
	   The rest of the train was squashed beneath or against the
collapsed overpass. The four tracks were strewn with debris _ some
from the crash, some created by rescuers ripping apart the
wreckage.
	   Deutsche Bahn officials lowered the speed limit for all
InterCity Express trains to slow to a maximum 160 kilometers (100
miles) an hour until all 100 high-speed trains in service could be
inspected. The 3,500-kilometers (2,175-mile) system is designed for
top speeds of 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour.
	   Ken Harris, editor of Jane's World Railways in London, said the
cause of the accident could only be determined by expert analysis.
	   ``It is very important to make the point that the German rail
network is a very, very, very safe railway. The engineering
standards and maintenance standards are very, very high. ... They
don't cut corners,'' Harris said.
	   Authorities set up a reception center for worried relatives in
in a sports hall in Eschede. The window shades were drawn and a
sign warning ``No Press'' was attached to plastic sheets covering
the door.
	   Bodies, or parts of them, were taken to Hanover for
identification.
	   ``The goal must be to identify the bodies as quickly as
possible,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl said after visiting the crash
scene. He pledged 1 million marks (dlrs 550,000) in government aid,
matching donations of the same size from the state government and
the railway.
	   Nearly five dozen clergymen and counselors made themselves
available to counsel relatives and rescue workers.
	   ``I still can't believe that this has cost so many lives. This
is just a little village in the heath that no one has ever heard
of,'' said Birgit Puhl, 42, a Red Cross volunteer who had driven 30
kms (20 miles) from her home in Wathlingen to extend help to
relatives of the dead and injured.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a story on mistreatment of Palestinian
detainees, The Associated Press described Abed Ahmar as an activist
in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO
faction opposed to the peace accords with Israel.
	   Ahmar was released from an Israeli jail last month after 30
months of detention without charges. In an interview with the AP
after his release, Ahmar denied membership in the PFLP, a
Damascus-based group which is an illegal organization in Israel.
	   The AP report failed to include Ahmar's denial.

Q: I just saw Kathy Griffin at Caroline's Comedy Club in New

<TEXT>
York City.
	   She's terrific. What can you tell me about her? Also, is she
involved with anyone, and will she be returning to Suddenly Susan?
- W.G.
	   A: Griffin, 31, a native of Oak Park, III., was determined to be
an entertainer from the age of five. After high school, her family
moved to Los Angeles, she studied acting at the Lee Strasberg
Institute and, in 1988, joined the Groundlings, an improv group
that included Lisa Kudrow, Jon Lovitz, and Phil Hartman.
	   Following improv, she switched to stand-up comedy and was cast
in guest shots on TV series such as ER and Seinfeld. That led to an
audition for Suddenly Susan, which, yes, she will remain on; her
character marries a rabbi in the season finale but doesn't
disappear.
	   Griffin is involved with someone, a writer, who's indulgent of a
peculiar interest of hers: crime, specifically serial killers and
mass murderers.
	   She studies crimes and sometimes attends trials.
	   Q: I heard that Pierce Brosnan is a grandfather. He looks too
young. Is he?
	   - F.T.
	   A: The dashing 46-year-old, who became a father again last year,
is indeed on the way to becoming a grandfather. His stepdaughter
Charlotte, of his late wife Cassandra, is due to give birth, which
will make Brosnan a grandpa.
	   Q: I've become a fan of the series The Magnificent Seven and
would like some information about Eric Close, who portrays Vin
Tanner. Is he related to Glenn Close, and what else has he done? -
M.S.
	   A: Despite the same last name, he isn't related to Glenn Close.
Besides the current series, Close has appeared in other TV series
such as Sisters, McKenna and Dark Skies, and TV movies such as
Hercules and Lost Kingdom and The Stranger Beside Me.
	   Right now, his manager is looking for movie work for him and is
awaiting the network's verdict this month about whether the series
will be picked up for another season.
	   Q: Whatever happened to Christina Applegate of Married...With
Children? - T.R.
	   A: Applegate, 25, who played sluttish daughter Kelly Bundy on
the series, has continued acting in movies such as Mars Attacks!
and the current The Big Hit.
	   But she should soon be back on TV. Applegate has just been cast
as the lead in a new NBC sitcom called All My Life, about a single
mother and waitress dealing with her brother and her father.
	   It's a sitcom with a good pedigree; its creators also created
Friends and Veronica's Closet.
	   Q: I recently saw the movie Double Team and thought Dennis
Rodman was pretty good. Will he be doing any more acting? - G.F.
	   A: Some might suggest that Rodman, who turns 37 next week, is
acting all the time, but there are plans in the works for the
flamboyant basketball star to do some more professional acting.
	   The producers are retooling the syndicated series Soldier of
Fortune, about a group of former military operatives who now fight
crime, and Rodman is seriously in the running to star.
	   If the deal comes through, he's not giving up his day job,
however; he'll still play for the Chicago Bulls.

Billionaire investor George Soros has expressed interest in

<TEXT>
acquiring government's remaining stake in Philippine National Bank
(PNB), according to a ranking finance official.
	   The source told reporters Soros wanted to conduct a
comprehensive study on the country's second largest bank.
	   Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez confirmed this report,
saying one of Soros' associates approached him to ask about
government's stake in PNB.
	   ``There are many interested investors in the PNB, and Soros is
one of them,''said Enriquez.
	   Soros is one of the most influential financiers in the US. He
has been named as one of the powerful figures behind speculative
attacks that brought down Asia's major currencies, including the
Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht, last year. The depreciation
triggered a regional crisis that, among others, brought down the
Suharto regime in Indonesia.
	   The incoming administration of President-elect Joseph Estrada
has expressed its intention to sell all of government's stake in
PNB in a year.
	   Estrada takes over from President Fidel Ramos on June 30.
	   Government still holds the biggest single stake in PNB with
45.59% although the bank has been technically in private hands
since 1996.
	   ``Government is not in a position to infuse additional capital
because it is contrary to the privatization thrust. So, instead of
being diluted, we will prepare a program to sell the remaining
stake,'' a close Estrada aide said. ``I'd rather go for a public
bidding... The idea is to get the best out of the selling of those
shares and help cover budget shortfalls...
	   It's attractive for a new investor if we get out all of
government's shares.''
	   He added government would impose a condition for buyers to bring
in new capital.
	   The bank once lorded over the domestic banking industry but in
recent years has lost out to leaner competitors with more
flexibility in raising capital from its private shareholders.
	   PNB President Peter Favila said the new government should make
the bank's privatization a priority this year to raise its capital
base and remain competitive.
	   He said the bank's top officials were coordinating with
Estrada's Finance Secretary-designate Edgardo Espiritu, who was
once the bank's president and spearheaded its rehabilitation in
1986.
	   Favila said PNB was likely to pursue a convertible bond issue
that had earlier been scheduled in the second quarter of 1997 and
was stalled by the financial crisis in the region.
	   The bank plans to raise $200 million to $250 million.
	   Favila said the bank had five serious expressions of intent from
both local and foreign groups to buy into the bank, but he gave no
names.
	   ``There's been a great deal of interest in PNB... There should
be a long-term commitment. They should be prepared to dig deep into
their pockets,'' he said.
	   Analysts said PNB was vulnerable to a buy-in after its shares
began trading below book value when the currency turmoil took hold
of the region in the second half of 1997. They estimated PNB's book
value at P150 to P155 a share.

the first four months of the year, the National Statistics Office
said yesterday.
	   For April 1998, aggregate receipts grew by 9.8% to $2.285
billion from $2.082 billion last year, which was an increase of
$202.10 million. Shipments of electronics and components,
accounting for 53% of aggregate receipts, grew by 31.7% to $1.212
billion from $919.90 million last year.
	   Income from exports of articles of apparel and clothing
accessories, the second top earner for the month, dipped 4.3% to
$154.06 million from $160.97 million.
	   Input/output/peripheral units, maintaining its hold of third
spot, brought in $151.53 million which was 13.5% higher than
$133.52 million a year ago.
	   Revenue from coconut oil exports registered a gain of 42.9% as
shipments amounted to $65.54 million, up from $45.87 million last
year.
	   Earnings from woodcraft and furniture went up to number five
despite an 11.7% decline. Sales amounted to $33.31 million, which
was $4.40 million lower than $37.71 million in 1997.
	   Rounding up the list of the top ten dollar earners for April

consignment basis, $30.21 million; ignition wiring sets and other
wiring sets used in vehicles, aircraft and ships, $27.13 million;
metal components, $25.73 million; gold, $21.92 million; and fresh
bananas, $18.70 million.
	   Total receipts from the top 10 exports amounted to $1.74 billion

sales amounted to $2,009.90 million, up from $1,726.32 million a
year earlier.
	   Agro-based products made up the next biggest commodity group
representing 5.7% of the aggregate value. Receipts reached $129.48

transactions, $48.14 million; mineral products, $46.50 million;
other agro-based products, $38.27 million; petroleum products,
$10.44 million; and forest products, $1.41 million. Exports to the
US, accounting for 34.2% of the total, posted a 10.3% increase
reaching $780.70 million from $708.07 million a year earlier.
	   Japan purchased some $323.58 million worth of goods, which was
0.7% lower from $325.99 million last year. Its share was pegged at
14.2%.
	   The Netherlands bought $219.76 million worth of local
merchandise, which was a 53.4% increase over $143.25 million last
year.
	   Singapore and the UK emerged as the fourth and fifth biggest
markets respectively. Sales to Singapore were valued at $139.06
million while those to the UK amounted to $135.99 million.

FVR Goes for Villar;Lakas Solons Object
The crack inside Lakas continued to widen yesterday after

<TEXT>
unconfirmed reports said that President Fidel V. Ramos had given
his ''anointment'' to Las Pinas Rep. Manuel Villar as the party's
candidate for the House speakership.
	   An administration solon, who requested anonymity, said that
Ramos' choice has caused a commotion inside the ruling party.
	   According to the solon, a bloc spearheaded by administration
lawmakers who have an eye on the lower house's top post was being
organized to derail Villar's bid.
	   The same bloc, the source continued, was to hold a meeting late
yesterday afternoon. The meet was supposed to be presided over by
Reps. Sergio Apostol (Lakas, Leyte), Feliciano Belmonte (Lakas,
Quezon City) and Simeon Datumanong (Lakas, Maguindanao) to discuss
measures on how to thwart a possible Villar speakership.
	   The meeting was held at the residence of Lakas President Speaker
Jose de Venecia in Dasmarinas Village, Makati City. It remained
unclear if De Venecia was behind this bloc.
	   Congressman-elect and former senator Heherson Alvarez (Lakas,
Isabela), another contender for the post, was also set to join the
new bloc, the source added.
	   The group, which doubts Villar's loyalty to the party, expects
to recruit more Lakas members to its fold.
	   Lakas stalwarts are accusing Villar of supporting
president-elect Joseph Estrada in the last elections. Villar is the
richest member of the Lower House.
	   Lakas lawmakers were not available for comment but one aide
confirmed that Ramos' endorsement of Villar was up for resolution
at last night's party caucus at Malacanang where administration
congressman were scheduled to hold a straw vote.
	   The anti-Villar bloc, according to sources, will pursue its plan
even if the Las Pinas solon was not chosen by the party membership
at the Wednesday caucus.
	   Out-going House Minority Floorleader Ronaldo Zamora (Lammp, San
Juan) admitted on Monday that Villar would remain as one of Lammp's
top choices for the position because he (Villar) supported the
Estrada campaign.
	   On Tuesday, a newly-elected congressman from the North, who
refused to be named, said the President ``has intimated to him at a
meeting that Villar was a shoo-in for the Speakership and that
Lakas members should support him.''
	   The same congressman said Eduardo ``Danding'' Cojuangco, who
chairs the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), has also committed
to support Villar.
	   This effectively junked Rep. Gilberto Duavit's (NPC-Lammp-Rizal)
bid who was earlier rumored as Cojuangco's personal choice, the
source said This development was also corroborated yesterday by
another Lakas congresswoman who said Ramos has already given Villar
''his personal blessing.'' But the lady solon said Villar's own
group in the Lower House has decided to boycott the caucus called
by the President Wednesday night to ''signify its independence.''
House observers, however, noted that Villar's group was only
avoiding a possible confrontation with the anti-Villar Lakas
members.
	   Among the lawmakers who support Villar's speakership bid are
Reps.
	   Marcial Punzalan (Lakas, Quezon), Ralph Recto (Lakas, Batangas),
Angelito Sarmiento (Lakas, Bulacan), Lualhati Antonio (Lammp-South
Cotabato) and first-termer Aniceto Saludo Jr. (Lammp-Southern
Leyte).

Phone company Swisscom to enter stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of the Swiss government's postal service,
Thursday confirmed its entry into the stock market for the largest
privatization move ever in Switzerland.
	   The Swiss federal government, currently the sole owner, plans
initially to place a maximum of 49.9 percent of the share capital
on the market, the company announced in a press release.
	   ``It is the first big privatization in Switzerland,'' said Tony
Reis, Swisscom's chief executive officer. ``It will likely be the
biggest transaction of its kind ever to take place in
Switzerland.''
	   The government will continue to hold the majority of Swisscom's
share capital. The exact size of the offer will be revealed closer
to the date, the company said.
	   Analysts value Swisscom at around 10 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
6.9 billion).
	   David Schnell, its chief financial officer, said that the
flotation likely would be in the middle of fall.
	   A major part of the shares will be offered to private Swiss

that already has 'feet on the street' in 100 countries in every
corner of the world.''

the partnership with Unisys leverages both companies' strengths to
deliver the best value to Dell customers.

technology industry,'' Dell said.

Amnesty: Equatorial Guinea convicts face ethnic hatred, death
</HEADLINE>
  By GLENN McKENZIE  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Amnesty International pressured
Equatorial Guinea's president Friday to grant clemency to 15 death
row inmates, whom it says were tortured and persecuted on ethnic
grounds.
	   Amnesty's Secretary General Pierre Sane said the convicts _
members of Equatorial Guinea's minority Bubi tribe _ were unfairly
condemned to death for treason this week after they confessed while
being tortured by the military.
	   Equatorial Guinea denied the charges.
	   The 15 were among more than 100 defendants _ including four
Spaniards of Equatorial Guinean origin _ tried for sedition during
a five-day summary military tribunal.
	   Another 40 received jail terms ranging from six to 26 years,
while at least six others died in detention as a result of torture,
Sane said in a report faxed to the Ivory Coast in West Africa.
	   The fate of the remaining 39 defendants was unclear.
	   The defendants were accused of involvement in a Jan. 21 attack
on a military barracks on Equatorial Guinea's Bioko Island, home of
the minority Bubi tribe.
	   The attack left four soldiers and one civilian dead and resulted
in the arrests of some 500 people, mostly Bubi. The island is the
stronghold of an outlawed Bubi-based opposition political group,
the Bioko Autonomy Movement.
	   Some defendants showed visible scars from their ordeal, and at
least 10 had parts of their ears severed off with razor blades, the
Amnesty report said.
	   Most had been detained solely on account of their ethnic origin,
Sane said in the report.
	   ``Detainees were asked to dig the graves of those present in
court on the same day of the sentence and a firing squad was
prepared to shoot them on the beach near the prison where they are
detained,'' the Amnesty International report said.
	   A diplomat from Equatorial Guinea, however, said the trials were
fair.
	   ``There is no basis to any claims of this trial being held on
ethnic issues,'' said Maria Ebuna, a diplomat at Equatorial
Guinea's embassy in Washington. ``Illegal, violent terrorist acts
were committed and those put to trial just happened to be from the
same ethnic group. It was a pretty fair trial.''
	   She said the government had not been involved in the case.
	   Although President Teodoro Obiang suspended the 15 executions at
the last moment, the sentences remain in place and it was unclear
how long the suspension would last.
	   Amnesty said the trial broke most international standards of a
fair hearing. Many of the detainees were not allowed to testify and
military prosecutors offered little evidence against them.

Atherton's century puts England in control
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES stumps score  
  By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Mike Atherton hit a defiant unbeaten
103 and shared a record opening stand with Mark Butcher to put
England in control of the first cricket test against South Africa
Thursday.
	   Atherton, in his first innings since standing down as captain,
shared a 179 partnership with Butcher, then an unbroken 70-run
stand with Alec Stewart in England's 249 for one at stumps on the
first day.
	   Hansie Cronje's decision to send England into bat backfired on
what is traditionally a bowler-friendly Edgbaston pitch.
	   After an uncertain start, influenced by heavy cloud cover,
Atherton and Butcher batted together for four-and-a-half hours to
post the highest first wicket stand in a test at Edgbaston.
	   The openers bluntly defied the much-vaunted pace attack led by
Allan Donald to improve on the 171 run record set by South Africans
Bob Catterall and Bruce Mitchell in 1929.
	   It was also England's first century opening stand against South
Africa since Bob Barber and Geoff Boycott shared 120 at Kingsmead,
Durban in 1964-65.
	   The stand was only the second opening century stand against the
Proteas by any test team since their readmission to test cricket.
The Pakistan pair Aamir Sohail and Saeed Anwar put on 101 at
Kingsmead earlier this year.
	   After Butcher was dismissed in the final session, Atherton and
skipper Stewart continued to frustrate the South African in a
85-minute alliance.
	   It was Atherton's first century in 24 innings since his 118
against New Zealand in Christchurch in February 1997.
	   Atherton, edged medium paceman Shaun Pollock to third man for
his 12th boundary to reach his 12th test century, his 46th in
first-class cricket.
	   Atherton, 30, acknowledged the standing ovation of 15,000-plus
crowd and kissed the crest on the helmet after Stewart
congratulated him.
	   ``It was a kind of wicket where you never really felt it was
going to be your day. The surface wasn't that bad but the ball was
swinging around an awful lot and you needed some luck,'' Atherton
said later.
	   ``Test match hundreds are always special, especially when you
get them against Donald and Pollock. It was more special because I
hadn't got one for a long time.''
	   Atherton, was outscored in the first 32 minutes by left hander
Butcher, but once settled down, was simply brilliant as played
classic cuts, drives, hooks and pulls in his 275-ball knock over
six hours.
	   It took the former captain 23 balls to score his first runs,
playing and missing during the initial seven-over spell by Pollock.
He scored his first runs by edging Pollock to the third-man
boundary for the first boundary.
	   Atherton, who stood down in winter after a record-52 tests as
captain, survived three confident appeals for leg before wicket.
	   Butcher, whose 77 was his highest score since his 51 against
Australia at Manchester last year, was caught out playing a sweep
shot against the left-arm wrist spin of Paul Adams.
	   Butcher, lucky to win test selection after an ordinary tour of
the West Indies early this year, hit seven fours off 214 balls
before Jacques Kallis caught him on the deep square leg boundary.
	   Stewart, having edged his counterpart Cronje past his stumps for
his first run, hit three fours in his 63-ball innings so far.

Various government and non-government organizations in Cagayan

<TEXT>
de Oro City are strongly supporting the ongoing power projects of
Mindanao Energy System (Minergy) which supplies electricity to
Cagayan de Oro Electric Power  Light Co. (Cepalco).
	   The Regional Development Council of Region 10, the Association
of Barangay Councils, the City Mayor of Cagayan de Oro, socio-civic
organizations including the Oro Chamber of Commerce of Cagayan de
Oro and the Council of Rotary Club Presidents have passed
resolutions endorsing the power projects of Minergy.
	   They have cited the role of Minergy in providing reliable power
supply to Cagayan de Oro and nearby towns of Misamis Oriental when
Mindanao was hit by one of worst droughts which substantially
reduced the hydroelectric power generation in the region.
	   This has resulted in 1990-1991 to the curtailment of power
supply from the state-owned National Power Corp. (NPC) by 50% or an
equivalent of 12-hour power interruption daily.
	   Minergy is a registered project of the Board of Investments
which was accredited at the height of the power crisis during the
presidency of Corazon Aquino.
	   The franchised area of Minergy covers Cagayan de Oro City, and
includes the towns of Tagoloan, Villanueva and Jasaan in Misamis
Oriental.
	   Minergy and Cepalco have forged an energy purchase agreement
which was approved by the Energy Regulatory Board.
	   Cepalco, which owns 32% of Minergy, cited the latter's important
role and relevance as a back-up supplier of electricity.

Kaunda announces his plans, with unclear time frame
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CLARIFIES throughout Kaunda's intention to organize the
opposition, then retire from politics  
  By ANGUS SHAW  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda announced
Thursday that he intends to retire from opposition politics in
order to become a peace mediator for Africa.
	   But he said he would not step down until he healed rifts within
his own United National Independence Party and helped ``other
sister parties'' to mount a strong political opposition against
President Frederick Chiluba.
	   ``Until I report to congress, I will be in control,'' Kaunda
said. ``When I leave active politics I want to leave behind a very
strong party.''
	   Kaunda, 74, was freed earlier this week after the state dropped
charges that he knew about plans for a failed coup attempt last
year. He had been under house arrest for five months.
	   The question of Kaunda's future has occupied regional leaders
trying to keep peace in the southern African region.
	   Widely criticized for his 27 years of dictatorial socialist rule
blamed for bankrupting the nation, Kaunda was replaced by Chiluba
in the country's first democratic elections in 1991. But he
regained respectability as he fought Chiluba's maneuvers to keep
him from running again in 1996.
	   Earlier this week, South African President Nelson Mandela denied
that regional leaders promised Chiluba they would persuade him to
retire from politics if he was released.
	   But then on Wednesday, Mandela publicly encouraged Kaunda to
step down.
	   In vintage style known throughout his public life, Kaunda wept
and dabbed his eyes with a white handkerchief at a press conference
that still left open his true intentions.
	   He said he would revive an institute for peace and democracy
that he hoped foreign donors would fund, using it to back a future
role as a peace mediator and roving ambassador within and outside
the Southern African Development Community, to which Zambia
belongs.
	   ``I see African children dying in their thousands, I see men and
women killing each other,'' Kaunda said. ``Do you expect me to be
quiet?''
	   It is unclear who proposed the roving diplomat role, but media
reports this week suggested SADC leaders were behind the idea.
Kaunda refused to name his backers on Thursday.
	   On Wednesday, Kaunda said he would not allow such a role to
interfere with his involvement in opposition politics. But at the
press conference, he made it clear that he would retire from
politics first.
	   Kaunda said he would ask his party at a special convention that
he be allowed to ``detach myself form party politics so I may make
a contribution on a wider scale.''
	   Party officials said it could take several weeks to arrange
facilities and raise the dlrs 200,000 necessary to bring 3,000
party delegates together.

<TEXT>
	   WARE, England (AP) _ Scotland's Colin Montgomeire took the
first-round lead Thursday in the English Open, firing an
8-under-par 64 on the 7,016-yard Marriott Hanbury Manor course.
	   Montgomerie missed tying the course record of 63 shot last
season by American Jay Townsend.
	   European tour newcomer Nicolas Joakimides of France shot a
7-under par 65, one stroke off the pace. Three players were tied at
6-under: Nicolas Vanhootegem of Belgium, Stephen Leaney of
Australia and Jon Robson of England.
	   Andrew Coltart of Scotland and Robert Allenby shot 5-under 67s

Al Fayed `determined to get to truth' in Paris trip
</HEADLINE>
  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the eve of a key hearing in the Princess Diana
case, Mohamed Al Fayed said Thursday he ``will not rest'' until
he's determined the crash was only an accident, not a plot.
	   Al Fayed is planning to attend Friday's closed-door hearing, in
which Judge Herve Stephan is trying to clarify once and for all the
role of the photographers under investigation in the case.
	   The crash last Aug. 31 in a Paris traffic tunnel killed Diana,
her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. Tests
showed Paul was drunk at the time.
	   Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which is owned by Dodi's
father, Mohamed Al Fayed.
	   In a statement issued by his spokesman in London, Al Fayed said
Thursday he is ``determined to get to the truth.''
	   ``I will not rest until I am satisfied that what happened was
God's wish and not the wish of someone else,'' he said, according
to spokesman Lawrie Meyer.
	   French judicial sources have said recently that Al Fayed has
backed off his contention that the crash stemmed from a plot to
kill Diana and his son, and now thinks the paparazzi are to blame.
	   Al Fayed has filed as a civil party in the case, and therefore
has access to documents and proceedings.
	   Nine photographers and a press motorcyclist have been placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for
both manslaughter and non-assistance of a person in danger.
	   But most of those close to the case believe the photographers
will soon be exonerated _ at least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Gathering Friday at the Palais de Justice, the main courthouse
in Paris, will be the nine photographers and the press
motorcyclist, Al Fayed, and 10 eyewitnesses _ but not bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones.
	   Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash, was invited on an
``informational basis'' but has declined, judicial sources have
said.
	   Through his lawyer Thursday, Rees-Jones reiterated that Paul
wasn't visibly drunk the night of the crash.
	   ``Mr. Rees-Jones would not have allowed the Princess of Wales or
Dodi Fayed to be driven by anyone he knew or suspected to be
drunk,'' said the lawyer, David Crawford.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators have long
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they're said to
have long given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   Investigators also recently conducted road tests on a race track
near Paris to reconstruct the crash. Police revealed no details of
the tests.

Russia proposes U.N. force in Macedonia monitor Kosovo border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia proposed Thursday that a United Nations
force in Macedonia be used to monitor the border between
neighboring Albania and the tense Serbian region of Kosovo.
	   Russia ``supports the idea of monitoring the border between
Albania and Kosovo, but insists that this operation be conducted
under U.N. aegis,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin
told the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia opposes any plans to send NATO troops to the area.
	   A United Nations peacekeeping force was sent to Macedonia in
1992 to prevent the spread of ethnic conflicts in other parts of
the former Yugoslavia.
	   Since the end of the Bosnian war, Russia has been urging that
the Macedonia operation be closed.
	   In December, the Security Council granted a ``final extension''
of the mandate until Aug. 31, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov
said at the time there ``could be no question'' that the troops
would leave thereafter.

Air France holds new talks with pilots as labor unrest spreads

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France officials sat down for talks with
striking pilots Thursday hoping to break a deadlock which is fast
becoming a public relations disaster for France ahead of the World
Cup.
	   The third round of talks began at Air France's Paris
headquarters at around 7 p.m. (1700 GMT), and were expected to
continue well into the night.
	   In a show of force, several hundred striking pilots, arms
crossed and in full uniform, stood by the building as officials
entered for the talks.
	   The pilots have been off work for four days, and are prepared to
strike for at least 15 days, coinciding with the start of the June
10-July 12 soccer championship which will attract an estimated one
million visitors.
	   With just six days until the World Cup begins, France is plagued
by labor disputes.
	   Paris subway drivers and railway workers in southern France also
staged minor strikes Thursday, heaping further misery on visitors
who have already arrived in France for the World Cup, as well as
other tourists.
	   Baggage handlers have been on strike for three days at Charles
de Gaulle airport in Paris.
	   Other pay disputes threatened to paralyze trains as of Friday
through the weekend, and airline mechanics also planned a walkout.
	   The transport woes were causing embarrassment and anger among
French officials who feared for the country's image.
	   Michel Charasse, a Socialist senator, accused the pilots of
being ``egotistical, and not loving their country.''
	   ``It's a question of putting yourself before France,'' he said
in an interview with radio station Europe 1.
	   Leading conservative lawmaker Philippe Seguin said the strike
risked making France ``the laughing stock of the entire world.''
	   Few members of the public showed sympathy for the pilots.
	   ``It's typically French, raising hell like that, and they pick
just the right time to do it,'' said Christophe Monot, a shirt shop
salesman.
	   ``It's unacceptable. It doesn't make us look good,'' said Yvette
Goupil, shaking her head as she sliced bread in her bakery.
	   The pilots are striking to protest planned salary cuts. Their
wages are considered among the world's highest in the sector. The
company wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts.
	   Referring to the new talks, Christian Paris, a spokesman for the
leading union SNPL, predicted ``significant advances.''
	   The strike posed a big test for the Socialist-government of
Lionel Jospin. But the government was standing firm.
	   The airline ``has the full support of the government,'' the
Socialist finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told the
National Assembly.
	   Commenting for the first time on the strike, President Jacques
Chirac on Wednesday called on both sides to ``show proof of their
responsibility'' in the dispute as France prepares to become ``the
host country of the planet.''
	   Air France has guaranteed travel throughout the tournament for
all participating teams.
	   The company will maintain a Thursday schedule of 17 percent of
its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of its short and
medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40
percent from Orly.

Forty-two major telecommunication companies, internet service

<TEXT>
providers (ISPs) and multimedia software and equipment developers
from 10 Asian countries are meeting in Manila June 9-10 to discuss
means of promoting multimedia technologies and services in the
region.
	   Participants will include officials and experts from such
companies as the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) of
Japan, Hongkong Telecommunications Ltd., Singapore Telecom, Korea
Telecom, Telekom Malaysia Berhad, PT Indonesian Satellite
Communications Ltd. and the Communications Authority of Thailand.
	   Smart Communications Inc. of the Philippines is hosting the
event.
	   To be held at Westin Philippine Plaza, the meeting is being
conducted under the auspices of the Asian Multimedia Forum (AMF),
an association of Asian telecoms, ISPs and software and equipment
developers.
	   Aside from technical presentations by experts regarding
potential new applications of multimedia systems, the meeting will
also feature an exhibit of state-of-the-art multimedia
technologies.
	   The term ``multimedia'' is often used to described new
technologies and services arising from the convergence of
computers, entertainment and telecommunications.
	   A multimedia telecommunications service -- such as the
high-speed international link of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) technology, provided jointly by Smart and NTT -- permits
users to send and receive images, sounds, text or data.
	   Technical experts at the conference in Manila will present

Government is set to bid out six build-operate-transfer (BOT)

<TEXT>
projects this year worth $738 million, according to the
Coordinating Council of the Philippines Assistance Program (CCPAP).
CCPAP said that these projects are now in the preparation stage and
are scheduled to be offered to interested investors within the
year.
	   Of the six projects, the biggest is the $607-million North Luzon
Expressway Extension to Cagayan Valley project proposed by the
Department of Public Works and Highway.
	   Other projects to be offered to potential investors are the
$82-million Land Titling Computerization Project, Driver's Training
Center Project, $12-million motor vehicle license plate plant,
$5-million Palace in the Sky, and the $2-million air cargo terminal
and cold storage facilities for the General Santos City Airport.
	   To date some 27 BOT projects worth some $4.492 billion have been
completed.
	   Most of the projects involved power generation, which helped
resolve the problem of brownouts that started in the early '90s.
	   Various infrastructure projects involving railways, water supply
and airports are now being undertaken through the BOT scheme and
its variants.
	   In 1997 alone, the country's BOT program was able to attract
$19.7 billion in investment proposals.
	   The BOT is a scheme adopted in 1992 to encourage private sector
investment in the area of infrastructure. Under the arrangement, a
proponent is allowed to build a project identified by government as
vital and operate it for a maximum of 25 years to enable the
investor to recover investments.
	   However, after the said period, the project will have to be
turned over to government for management.

Three Spaniards and a Frenchman in men's semis
</HEADLINE>
  By SALVATORE ZANCA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's not unusual to have three Spaniards in the
semifinals of a clay-court tournament _ if it's in Barcelona or
Madrid.
	   But in the French Open?
	   Unprecedented.
	   Carlos Moya, Felix Mantilla and Alex Corretja add some Iberian
flair to the French Open men's semis, with only Frenchman Cedric
Pioline left to prevent a Spaniard from winning for the third time
in six years.
	   ``I'm used to being the last Frenchman in Grand Slam
tournaments,'' Pioline said, ``but now I have three Spaniards
against me.''
	   Known for early-season success on clay while players from other
countries adjust to the slow surface, the Spanish men rarely win
the Grand Slam event.
	   Moya, Mantilla and Corretja have 13 titles on clay among them,
all in smaller tournaments. During the last decade, 79 clay court
titles have gone to Spaniards.
	   However only Sergi Bruguera, Manuel Santana and Andres Gimeno
have won the French Open for Spain, with Bruguera winning
consecutive titles in 1993 and 1994.
	   ``It's obvious we've been practicing on clay all our lives,''
Corretja said. ``It's normal now that we find the results. It's
also because we work really hard. I think it's time to change our
minds and forget about the small tournaments and try to go for the
big ones, as we did here.''
	   Clay seems to be Spain's favorite surface.
	   ``For a Spanish player, we don't have too many chances to win
many matches on grass and indoors,'' Moya said. ``But I hope this
is going to change.''
	   Moya is the only one of the trio in a previous Grand Slam,
losing to Pete Sampras on hard court at the 1997 Australian Open.
	   ``It will be hard. We're going to be friends until Friday,''
Moya said. ``Friday, when we get to the court, I will want to kill
him. On the court, of course, not off the court.''
	   Moya beat Pioline in the final at Monte Carlo, a big early
season tournament, after Pioline struggled into the final with
exhausting three-set victories. This time, Pioline is in the French
final after exhausting five-set victories, including a quarterfinal
against Hicham Arazi.
	   ``I really felt I gave everything I had,'' Pioline said,
	   At Roland Garros, Pioline will have the backing of the French
crowd, looking for it's native finalist since Henri Leconte in
1988.
	   ``Even when I'm tired, they want me to keep going and try to do
my best,'' Pioline said. ``A good part of my win (against Arazi)
was because of the crowd pushing me.''
	   Pioline has made the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open,
losing to Sampras both times in straight sets.
	   `It has been a help, because I know how one can feel after a
number of matches,'' Pioline said. ``When you reach the second
week, middle of the second week, end of the second week, I know how
to handle that problem and how to control the use of your time.''
	   Pioline has played Corretja three times, with the Spaniard
winning both matches on clay.
	   ``I think he's going to be difficult, for sure,'' Pioline said,
``because he's playing very well.''

Phone company Swisscom to enter stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of the Swiss government's postal service,
Thursday confirmed its entry into the stock market for the largest
privatization move ever in Switzerland.
	   The Swiss federal government, currently the sole owner, plans
initially to place a maximum of 49.9 percent of the share capital
on the market, the company announced in a press release.
	   ``It is the first big privatization in Switzerland,'' said Tony
Reis, Swisscom's chief executive officer. ``It will likely be the
biggest transaction of its kind ever to take place in
Switzerland.''
	   The government will continue to hold the majority of Swisscom's
share capital. The exact size of the offer will be revealed closer
to the date, the company said.
	   Analysts value Swisscom at around 10 billion Swiss francs (dlrs
6.9 billion).
	   David Schnell, its chief financial officer, said that the
flotation likely would be in the middle of fall.
	   A major part of the shares will be offered to private Swiss
investors and Swisscom employees will enjoy preferential terms.
	   Swisscom shares will be sold around the world by four regional
syndicates covering Switzerland, North America, Britain and ``the
rest of the world.''

concluding article, we will cover the remaining characteristics.
	   5. Seeing The Invisible Transcendental leaders are those who
have mastered the art of seeing things invisible. They can see into
the future. They do this by creating a shared vision of a dynamic
and attractive future for their organisations.
	   Developing a powerful vision is an art of creation.
Transcendental leaders know that all achievements begin with
imagination. George Bernard Shaw put it more succinctly when he
said: ``Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what
you desire, you will get what you imagine, and at last you create
what you will.''
	   A transcendental leader is able to communicate his vision in
such a compelling manner as to win over the will of others to
achieve it. When leaders have no vision, an organisation's
prospects are bleak and people are demoralised.
	   Transcendental leaders inspire a shared vision for their
organisations.
	   They encourage their followers to hold fast to this vision, for
they know that if this vision perishes, the organisational life
will be like a broken-winged eagle that cannot fly. A shared vision
helps increase job satisfaction and organisational commitment among
employees.
	   6. Listening To Silence Perhaps the most powerful lesson about
listening to silence comes from Helen Keller. Keller was born
blind, deaf and mute. She learnt Braille to help communicate with
others and most importantly, she developed a great internal
perception to listen to silence with her heart, mind and soul.
	   In the corporate world, there are two important situations in
which people are often silent in front of their leaders. When
overwhelmed by crisis or great challenges, the first reaction is
denial and avoiding the truth. It is no surprise that many people
in organisations do not bring up the actual organisational issues
to their leaders as they are. Many of these issues go through a
filtering process and by the time they reach the leaders at the
top, they are quite different. Leaders at the top who receive
filtered views will not address them effectively as these are not
the real issues.
	   There are two reasons why humans deviate from the truth. One is
a lack of authenticity - an attempt to conceal the truth to serve
one's interest.
	   The other is ignorance. People will only tell their leaders what
they know and what they know may not be the truth. Thus, people's
ignorance has become an obstruction in the path of truth. To
overcome this, leaders must learn to listen to the silent truth.
Transcendental leaders do this by developing a keen observation of
things and people. Often, it is not what is said but what that is
left unsaid that is critical.
	   Transcendental leaders develop great perception through their
analysis and observation which enables them to seek the truth. And
if I may paraphrase Plato, ``An unexamined view is not worth
viewing''.
	   Transcendental leaders listen to their inner voice of justice
and authenticity before they act. And such is the real ability to
listen to the silence.
	   7. Smelling The Scentless One of the great ills in organisations
is that people are reactive. We notice many organisations only
start to react when they smell smoke. They look for clear signs to
act. Thus a banking institution will only start tightening its
credit management system once it is besieged with huge non-
performing loans.
	   A sales organisation will only start to address its sales
strategies and products when it experiences a significant drop in
the market share.
	   A property and construction firm will only start to examine the
impact of its gearing ratio when there is a downturn in sales. And
all organisations will only strengthen their fundamentals when the
economy faces a crisis.
	   Transcendental leaders are those who can act before the signs
are there.
	   They base their actions on sound fundamentals. Thus
organisations that are led by transcendental leadership do not
over-gear themselves. They do not over-diversify. They do not
expose their organisations to too high a risk.
	   They have reserves and contingency plans to deal with crises.
	   When a transcendental leader goes into a jungle, he does not
need to smell the presence of a tiger to start arming himself.
Transcendental leaders are proactive and they act well ahead of any
crisis because they can smell the scentless.
	   8. Understanding Unarticulated Needs Some of the most successful
information technology companies today have transcendental leaders
who understand the unarticulated needs of customers. In the book,
Competing For The Future, Gary Hamel and C.K.
	   Prahalad pointed out that future industry leaders need to go
beyond ``customer-led''. They argued that customers are notoriously
lacking in foresight. Customers have unarticulated needs. Fifteen
years ago, how many of us were asking for cellular telephones, fax
machines and copiers at home, 24-hour discount brokerage accounts,
multi-valve automobile engines, video dial tone, compact disc
players, cars with on-board navigation systems, MTV or the
Internet?
	   What makes future opportunities difficult is not that the future
cannot be created but that leaders in organisations are bound by
only current and articulated needs of customers. Transcendental
leaders possess foresight of industry opportunities because they do
not become restricted by current possibilities only.
	   Transcendental leaders explore the unarticulated needs of
customers by asking three questions. First, what new types of
customer benefits should we seek to provide in five, 10 or 15
years? Second, what new competencies will we need to build or
acquire to offer those benefits to customers? And third, how will
we need to reconfigure the customer interface over the next several
years?
	   9. Surfacing Courage From Fear Jawaharlal Nehru, a
well-respected historical leader and the first prime minister of
India, said: ``There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in
life as fear.'' Fear is an emotion so strong that it robs a man's
power of acting and reasoning. Courage is not the absence of fear.
In fact, courage is advancement, despite fear. The reality is that
all men are afraid in battle. The difference is that brave men
overcome fear with a strong sense of belief and duty.
	   Leaders in crisis need to surface people's courage from fear to
move on.
	   They need to draw the courage to reform and strengthen the
fundamentals of their organisations and march on despite criticism
and predictions of gloom. As an old German proverb advises,
``Wealth lost -something lost; Honour lost - much lost; Courage
lost - all lost.''
	   10. Creating A Positive Future From Despair Oprah Winfrey, one
of the most popular personalities in the world, can now command a
US$250 million or RM950 million contract as a talk show host. Her
painful past of poverty and broken family was more of despair than
hope. Yet Winfrey was able to create a positive future from
despair.
	   She said: ``When I look at the future, it is so bright, it burns
my eyes.''
	   According to a Chinese proverb, if a man plants melons, he will
reap melons; if he sows beans, he will reap beans. If leaders want
to change their future output, they should begin by changing their
current input.
	   And Asian leaders during these tough times should change their
perspective from despair, to a positive future.
	   The creation of a positive future begins with looking at
opportunities that the crisis presents us. This is the crucial time
to increase productivity and the quality of products and services.
	   Leaders should take charge and turn the economy and their
respective organisations around. In these tough times, the only way
to lead people is to create a dynamic and positive future. Leaders
need to wake up from denial and blame and take charge of the future
of their organisations.
	   As Peter Drucker once said: ``The best way to predict the future
is to invent it.'' Transcendental leaders often wake up in the
morning and find that they do not like their current circumstances,
so they go all out and create a future that they and others can be
excited about.
	   Victor S.L. Tan is the chief executive officer of KL Strategic
Change Consulting Group. He holds a MBA degree from Ohio State
University. He is the author of the bestselling book `Change To
Win: The Change Imperative For Asian Companies'. His latest book is
titled `Changing Mindsets: Ensuring The Future Of Asian
Organisations'.
	   He will be conducting a two-day workshop on `Managing Tough
Times' on June 17 and 18. For details, call Jane or Olivia at Tel:

At the celebration of Italy's national day last Tuesday,

<TEXT>
Filipino businessmen were generally upbeat about prospects under an
Erap administration. Textile Magnate and Hotelier P.L. Lim thinks
Erap has the potential of becoming our country's greatest
President. What will make the big difference, P.L. thinks, is
political will.
	   Banker Ramon Sy, who says he risked ridicule of his peers as a
certified admirer of Erap long before he won, believes Erap is
saying and doing the right things. And like P.L., Ramon agrees Erap
will have the political will to back up his pronouncements.
	   Making Sense But since what he intends to accomplish could
stretch over the long haul, Ramon suggests Erap maintain the
momentum of enthusiasm by doing what can be done visibly and
immediately, such as cleaning up MM and sorting out the traffic
mess, among others. Ramon is probably right. It will be difficult
to explain to the masa why so many of the things Erap promised are
going to take so long. Erap will have to stave off impatience and
early disappointments with relatively popular here-and-now
projects. That makes sense.

KUALA LUMPUR: DAP national vice-chairman Dr Tan Seng Giaw said

<TEXT>
yesterday Tenaga Nasional Bhd should expedite schemes to improve
electricity supply in areas frequently affected by interruptions.
Dr Tan, who is also Kepong MP, said Tenaga should try its best to
maintain a steady supply to all areas. Citing an example, he said
areas in Jinjang, Kepong and Petaling Jaya have been plagued by
intermittent blackouts. ``After repeated discussions with Tenaga,
the situation improved for a while. But last month, there were
interruptions of supply in some areas and this made the people very
angry.''

FOR Ajit Bhaskaran Dass, the spirit of dance guides his very

<TEXT>
being. And it is this sublime spirit that he tried to kindle in the
hearts of his home audience.
	   The lawyer-turned-artist revels in the spiritual realms of
traditional classical Indian dance, Odissi and Bharatanatyam being
his forte.
	   His unflagging attempts to awaken a culturally-bereft city
audience have spawned a steady flow of productions over the past
five years.
	   Johor Baru saw the emergence of the sensuous Odissi dance form
when Suvarna Fine Arts' Dewdrops on the Lotus premiered in 1995.
Ajit and his first generation of classical Odissi performers
enthralled the audience with their spectacular presentation.
	   Suvarna's recent offering, bearing the same title, was a sequel
to its maiden creation.
	   Ajit, Suvarna artistic director, blended dance with theatre to
recreate the exquisite magic of this ancient temple dance.
	   Staged recently at the Johor Tourist Information Centre
auditorium in Johor Baru, the production's setting was a ruined
temple where dance once flourished and was worshippped, and was
later forgotten.
	   On an auspicious occasion, a group of celestial dancers descend
to dance in the precincts of the temple, to celebrate its past
glory.
	   Three children chance upon the temple and meet one of the
dancers, who takes them on an intriguing journey through the facets
of this enchanting dance form.
	   At the end of the exploration, the dancers no longer need to
descend to the temple, for the children have become inspired
dancers.
	   The theme may seem theatrical, but it had a thought-provoking
underlying message - and one, moreover, of particular relevance to
our fine arts scene.
	   The production tried to impress upon the audience the fact that
classical dance is not a thing of yore, and it is up to the younger
generation to realise its true beauty and carry the torch of this
traditional art.
	   The presentation consisted of nine well-knit recitals - Mangala
Charanam, Sthai, Ashtapadi, Pallavi, Durga Panchaka, Badya Pallavi,
Navarasa, Ardhanareswara, and Moksha.
	   The soul-stirring, lilting music, recorded in Bhubaneshwar, the
seat of Odissi, gave the audience a true taste of authenticity and
classicalism.
	   Ajit mesmerised the audience with his interpretation of this art
form, executed in inimitable style.
	   His flawless footwork, dexterity and expressive face treated the
Johor Baru crowd to an evening of ethereal esctasy.
	   His depiction of Shiva as Supreme Godhead, in his half-man
half-woman form, evinced near-perfect technique and absolute
co-ordination of movement with melodious music.
	   The packed audience broke into spontaneous applause as Ajit's
fiery exposition lit up to the stage.
	   The dance guru was ably complemented by a talented array of
disciples, both seniors and greenhorns. Usha Kartikeyan, Sudha
Balakrishnan and C.
	   Vijendra deserve special mention; their professionalism and
grace breathed life into the frozen temple frescoes in the
background.
	   Straight exposition of classical dance, Ajit realised, would be
too ``heavy'' for his audience to appreciate.
	   To render Odissi contemporary, great attention was paid to
masterful stage management, appropriate lightning, splendid set
decoration and resplendent costume design.
	   Coupled with this, of course, was brilliant choreography and
exuberant dancing.
	   The narration was in English, in a thoughtful effort to make the
performance accessible to multi-racial Malaysia.
	   The production aimed to drive home the point that Odissi, a less
ubiquitous Indian dance style here, has its own distinction and can
stand by itself as an individual dance form.
	   The performance saw the cognoscenti appreciating the nuances of
Odissi and the artistic vigour of the young master, while the
layman sat back and soaked in the visual aspect.
	   Ajit is envisaging a tour of this production to other states.
	   Dance lovers can look forward to Suvarna's next production
-Shakuntalam - a timeless dance-drama showcasing Bharatnatyam.

	   The first-generation ICE's, built between 1991-93, are capable
of hitting top speeds of 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour.
	   Officials earlier ordered all high-speed trains, including 43
from the second-generation models, to reduce speeds to 160
kilometers (100 miles) an hour pending inspections.
	   The decision to pull the 60 trains was sure to cause disarray
along 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) of rail served by Germany's
premier high-speed trains, launched in 1991.
	   ``We plan on trains' being delayed, but we will ask people to

THIS week's reminder by the National Unity and Social

<TEXT>
Development Ministry that solving social problems plaguing our
youngsters is as important as overcoming the nation's economic
problems is a timely one. There is no doubt that since the onset of
the current slowdown, economic issues have overshadowed all else.
Indeed, the national preoccupation is with effecting a steady
recovery.
	   But as the ministry has quite rightly pointed out, while
attending to the current economic situation is a priority, equally
significant for families is to ensure that the young do not get
involved in negative activities. If parents do not attend to the
problems of their children now, then social ills may see a sharp
increase, warned the ministry. The authorities are concerned that
the number of social problems is seeing a steady rise.
	   Even as the whole world is busy discussing the Asian financial
problems and of late the nuclear arms race in South Asia, it is
disquieting to read increasing reports of youngsters in some
advanced societies turning to violence and even taking lives. At
home, reports of rising hooliganism in some schools, increasing
incidence of parents surrendering their children to the Social
Welfare Department for rehabilitation and that dadah addiction
remains a serious problem form a worrying scenario.
	   Although the social problems among Malaysian youngsters are not
as bad as in some societies, there is no room for complacency. Nor
should we crow about our success in tackling such problems as
social ills could gravely afflict the nation in this highly
competitive environment once we let down our guard. The ministry's
emphasis on the family's role to see that the children are
disciplined and happy is clearly a move in the right direction.
Surely, the priority for parents is to ensure that their children
are healthy not just physically but mentally, emotionally and
spiritually as well. It is vital that the nation keeps the
perspective as it would be disastrous if it should save the economy
but lose the battle against social ills. The new generation's
indulgence in undesirable activities such as dadah addiction and
other vices could be translated into huge economic losses.
	   Psychologists and educationists have often cautioned that social
problems such as loafing is just the tip of the iceberg. The
consequences are of great concern for such youngsters are being
exposed to the danger of wrong company which could suck them into
all sorts of negative activities, worse still if they are criminal
in nature. Thus, the Government's introduction of a number of
healthy activities, such as Rakan Muda, for the nation's young to
channel their extra energy is laudable and should be closely
monitored. To keep up the interest of the young in these activities
is not easy as all things have a way of becoming routine. There is
therefore a need for constant injection of new ideas and the views
of the participants should be sought as this will avoid allegations
of foisting things on them.
	   Parenting courses are no less important and should be an
on-going effort. The authorities should also rope in the mass media
for they have an effective role in conveying parenting skills
through forums, plays and other effective forms of communication.
Indisputably, witty and educational episodes through TV and radio
are unbeatable in getting the message across to fathers and mothers
on their all-important roles.

Hints of movement in long-stalled Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: AMs. LEADS thoughout with new quotes from Arafat, Netanyahu,
other details. Changes byline.  
  By HILARY APPELMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid signs of imminent movement in the
long-stalled Mideast peace process, an Israeli newspaper said
Thursday that a U.S. plan would put 40 percent of the West Bank
under Palestinian control and restrict expansion of Jewish
settlements.
	   U.S. officials expect a decision from Israel within days on the
proposed plan, which has yet to be made public.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, returning to the Gaza Strip on
Thursday night from a trip to Jordan and Yemen, said the Americans
had promised that ``Everything will be complete'' no later than
mid-June.
	   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters
that ``There has been some progress in the direction of an
agreement that will be good for all sides.
	   ``But,'' he added, ``I can't tell you what or when until it is
completed.''
	   With a deal apparently near, all sides were jockeying for
position Thursday.
	   The Land of Israel Front, a group of right-wing legislators that
has threatened to bring down Netanyahu's government if he agrees to
a West Bank troop withdrawal, said it would reconsider its plans if
Netanyahu agreed to a referendum before carrying out any pullout.
	   Details of the U.S. initiative have been reported in the past,
but on Thursday, the Haaretz newspaper published what it said was
the complete plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points of the
initiative as published in Haaretz. A U.S. official, however, said
on condition of anonymity that the plan as printed was not
accurate, but would not elaborate.
	   Netanyahu said the published draft was ``simply not up to
date.''
	   Under the reported plan, Israel would withdraw troops in three
stages over 12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control
over 3 percent of the West Bank and partial control over another 24
percent. According to Haaretz, at the end of the pullback, they
would have full control over 18.2 percent and partial control over
22 percent, for a total of 40 percent _ a possible springboard for
statehood.
	   Talks on a permanent peace accord would begin immediately with
the first troop pullback.
	   In the agreement, Israel promises not to expand Jewish
settlements in a significant way, says it will refrain from
demolishing 1,800 Palestinian homes currently slated for
construction and restricts land confiscations.
	   In another nod to the Palestinians, sections of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction will be annulled by vote
of the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather than the much
larger Palestine National Council, as demanded by Israel.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, will not question Israeli
credentials at the United Nations, and Arafat will outlaw
incitement against Israel and systematically confiscate illegal
weapons.
	   A trilateral committee will meet every two weeks to discuss
security matters, and an American-Palestinian committee will follow
up on the cases of suspected Palestinian militants. Israel has
complained about a revolving-door policy under which Arafat arrests
Islamic militants for show and then quickly releases them.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Netanyahu had embraced most of
the Amerian proposals, including a 13 percent troop pullback over
12 weeks, and that the key sticking point now was the scope of an
additional withdrawal. Netanyahu wants to limit that pullback to 2
percent, but the Palestinians said they expected a more generous
offer.
	   ``We will never agree to a 2 percent redeployment,'' Asfour told
The Associated Press. Asfour said that under the American plan, the
scope of the next pullback was to be negotiated at a later time and
not included in the current package.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met with senior Palestinian negotiators
in London on Thursday.
	   President Ezer Weizman was briefed by Netanyahu on the
negotiations Thursday and said afterward, ``I don't want to say
that it is over yet, but I am more optimistic than in the past.''

The Gospel and the stage. Religion and entertainment. Not

<TEXT>
exactly an easy mixture. But it is one that Trumpets Inc. has
blended and refined through the years, successfully coming up with
excellent, high-quality theatrical productions without compromising
its vision. Trumpets has carved a comfortable niche among the
theater audience, crossing over from what could have been a
strictly Christian market into the mainstream. And it has drawn
raves in the process.
	   Joseph the Dreamer, the play still commonly identified with the
company, boasts of a two-year run. The Lion, the Witch, and the
Wardrobe, a musical adaptation of the C.S. Lewis children's
classic, garnered enthusiastic acclaim last year and will be
restaged this August. On the business side, the theater company is
very much in the black.
	   They do seem to be living up to their name. Trumpets, after all,
stands for Triumphant People's Evangelistic Theater Society, Inc.
And they attribute it all to God.
	   As Artistic Consultant and co-founder Freddie Santos puts it,
``We wanted to present the gospel in a theatrical form whose level
of entertainment and quality cannot be questioned. If you reject
the play, it's because you are rejecting the message -- and not
because of the kind of quality of the presentation.''
	   The core of artists that first made up Trumpets all experienced
a relationship with God within a few months of each other from
December 1986 to January 1987. All of them were respected, very
experienced stage artists: Enchang and Mari Kaimo, Luna Inocian,
Audie Gemora (who is now Trumpets president), and Freddie. They
were burdened with the desire to spread the good news of salvation
and the power of God. And they wanted to do it in the medium they
knew best. By the end of 1988, they had produced their first
musical, First Name. After that, Trumpets was born.
	   Audie explains, ``We are a ministry. Our aim is evangelistic,
doing the Great Commission, of reaching out with the Gospel. But we
are using the arts.''
	   Freddie concurs, ``That is what we know and have lived for
years: the arts.
	   God showed us how to use the arts to achieve His purposes.''
	   It was literally going into uncharted territory. Or as per the
vision that God had given Freddie, it was like plow cutting through
dry ground. The first hurdle was finding Bible-based or Christian
material that the group could present to the mainstream audience.
There was practically none -- or at least, nothing suitable for a
Filipino audience. First Name was an original; Trumpets' future
works, apparently, would have to be the same.
	   The Trumpets people ordered material from the US churches and
literally went through three boxes of cantatas and musical pieces.
The pieces were good, but could only appeal to the church-going
audience.
	   The Dreamer, a cantata written by Cam Floria, was a favorite
among both the US churches and the Filipino Christians who liked
listening to what is now known as ``Christian music.'' It seemed to
be the ``natural'' thing to do.
	   After obtaining the rights to the cantata, Freddie fleshed out a
complete script, converting the little musical piece into a two-act
musical, now retitled Joseph the Dreamer. The response was
overwhelming. First staged in Cebu, word of mouth spread to Manila
and by the time the musical reached the metropolis, the theater
audience was in anticipation. They were not disappointed with what
they saw, and the play consistently played to full houses. Joseph
the Dreamer enjoyed a five-year run, touring in certain cities, and
played on television twice. According to Luna, even now, the
musical is still very much in high demand.
	   The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was another successful
venture into untrod ground. Again, Trumpets did their own writing
(via Luna and Jaime del Mundo) after going over the two already
existing stage musical adaptations of the Lewis classic. One was
too British; the other seemed to ``lack a heart.'' Luna says,
``Pinoys want a lot of heart, especially in their musicals. They
will forgive you the length of the material, if you can grab their
heart.'' This Pinoy musical of Lion obviously did. Tickets sold
``like crazy,'' and the 10 scheduled performances became 14. Even
now, audience expectation is already beginning to rise with the
August restaging.
	   The financial success of their productions obviously shows the
Almighty's approval upon His enterprise. Along with Butch Jimenez,
Audie handles the business and marketing side. Audie maintains,
``We run Trumpets like a business enterprise. We put a lot of
effort on our marketing. Our plays have all very well been
attended, and we get a lot of sponsorship. We have enough to keep
going, we're not losing money, and our actors are all well paid.''
	   Good news, indeed, and a very far cry from the time almost a
decade ago when Trumpets garnered some criticisms from the very act
of charging tickets. To quote one verbal diatribe, ``Why charge
tickets when the Gospel is free?'' Freddie has a ready answer,
``The Gospel may be free, but the show isn't.''
	   Fortunately, the churches have become supportive over the years.
Not a few pastors and ministers are beginning to see the
effectiveness of the stage as a tool to proclaim the Gospel. One
fellowship has even lent their auditorium for free as a rehearsal
venue, saving the group a lot of money in rental costs. Another
wants to see -- and is willing to pay for Trumpets shows for its
congregation on a regular basis.
	   Perhaps, though, the more meaningful rewards transcend the
financial. It is the change of heart that comes upon the audience
who watch the Trumpets' shows.
	   Joseph the Dreamer was more than just an animated retelling of
the Bible message. It was a touching, moving story on
reconciliation and forgiveness. During the final scenes, men in the
audience were seen to be weeping.
	   Widows, Orphans, and Wildebeests explored marital discord,
separation, and the breakdown of relationships. While it garnered
seven excellent reviews and had a successful run at the Music
Museum, Freddie says that it was a ``sad production'' for the
Trumpets people. The stories, after all, were not fiction, but
practically lifted from the lives of friends and other people whom
they know very well. Widows made the point that the presence of God
had to be present for any relationship to work. Many men who saw
the production did not leave unaffected.
	   One particularly rewarding experience was undergone by the
Trumpets people who showed Pamilya Maleta in one lonely town in
Bulacan. The comedy, written in Tagalog, was about the trials and
tribulations of a Japayuki. It was presented in the town square. To
their depression, the Trumpets artists saw that except for one
drunkard, nobody was watching their play. Still, they performed,
confident of their divine mandate. After the presentation, the
drunkard approached the group weeping, saying that the play had
touched his heart. Apparently, he had lost all meaning in life and
was going to kill his family then commit suicide. Watching Pamilya
Maleta, he discovered the existence and the love of God.
	   Audie explains, ``We're like ministers of God in that sense,
that we bring the Gospel to the people. When there's truth in the
performance, then that's good acting. But the impact of the
presentation on the people, how it transforms their lives, that's
the work of the Holy Spirit. We cannot take credit for that. After
our presentations, I've had people come up to me saying that their
lives have been changed.''
	   After the run of Lion, what's in store for Trumpets in the
future?
	   Freddie says, ``We're always expecting. We're always snooping
with a readiness mode, asking, 'Is this what you want, Lord?' A lot
of our productions were not what we had expected.''
	   One of them, Reading Lewis, ostensibly a reading of Lewis'
autobiography, became a dramatized reading. Neither straight
theater nor straight reading, but a mixture of both. So....David
was another surprise.
	   Starting out as a presentation of students in the Trumpets
Acting Workshop, this series of musical skits of the different
stages in the the shepherd-boy-turned-king's-life became a
complete, if short, musical.
	   Freddie is the first to admit that their productions are mestizo
-- or a combination of the various art forms that they know and
love, a mixture of theater, music, concert, readings, etc. This
willingness to improvise and experiment is also another form of
their tendency to break new ground.
	   Trumpets has also grown. The company can now tap into a
reservoir of more than a hundred talented artists who work on a
free-flowing or per-project basis.
	   Audie says, ``For His work in Trumpets, God got people from
inside the industry. But He still left us in. All of us are still
working in our fields. At the same time, we're still free to move
around, to expand our horizons. The beauty of this arrangement is
that God didn't make Trumpets a repository of talents. Our talents
can join other groups, form new relationships, bring people in --
and share with them the love of God.''
	   The forms may change, the plays may vary, but the message of
Trumpets remains the same. And even as its core of artists are
reaching out to draw people in, they're also always flying high to
where -- or to Whom -- from where the vision begins.
	   (So......David will be presented at the Shangri-La Plaza on June
4 and 5, 8 p.m., at the 6th Level.)

PETALING JAYA, Tues. - Police have detained 16 men in connection

<TEXT>
with the hijackings of two lorries and their consignments of beer
and scrap aluminium in Selangor and Negri Sembilan last month.
	   They have also recovered the vehicles and goods comprising 738
crates of Carlsberg beer worth about RM60,000, and scrap aluminium
worth about RM10,000.
	   A police party found the crates of beer hidden in a store at the
Desa Ria Flats early last week, while the scrap aluminium was
recovered, a few days later.
	   District police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner II Ahmad
Fuaad Sidek said today initial investigations revealed that the men
were part of a gang which was also involved in several robberies.
	   He said that on May 7, a lorry transporting crates of beer was
hijacked by a gang in Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor, while the other
vehicle loaded with scrap aluminium was hijacked near the Seremban
toll plaza, five days later.
	   Ahmad Fuaad said that police got their `break' when they
arrested two men for fighting in Taman Kinrara, Puchong, two weeks
ago.
	   Investigations revealed that the fight stemmed from a dispute
over the takings of the two hijackings.

PETALING JAYA, Tues. - Three former guards were fined RM1,000

<TEXT>
each or a month's jail in the magistrate's court today for unlawful
possession of RM17,000 worth of toiletries belonging to a company
here.
	   Yadden Yusoff, 27, Shuhaile Ishak, 35, and Ahmad Nadzri Muhamad
Yahya, 34, admitted to committing the offence, with another person
still at large, at the Unza (M) Sdn Bhd factory in Persiaran
Permai, Petaling Jaya, about 8.30pm between Sept 25 and Sept 27,
1994.
	   They were jointly charged with Rahman Juma, 31, on Dec 13, 1994.
Rahman has since jumped bail.
	   The facts stated that about 2.20am on Feb 15, 1994, a police
patrol stopped two vans in Subang Jaya and found them conveying
perfumes, powder and shampoo.
	   When the three were unable to explain why they were in
possession of the items, they were arrested.
	   In mitigation, they said they were told by a friend the goods
were factory rejects and that they were meant to be destroyed.
	   They said they had collected the items and kept them in their
house.

South Africa, Burkina Faso to establish diplomatic relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa will recognize the
democratically newly elected government of Sierra Leone, a foreign
affairs statement said Thursday.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo met Thursday with his counterpart
from Sierra Leone, Shama Banya, at an Organization of African Unity
meeting in Burkina Faso.
	   The statement said South Africa would open diplomatic relations
after the re-installation of the democratically elected government
of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   South Africa was one of the first countries to condemn last
May's take-over by a military junta in Sierra Leone.
	   ``Let it be a signal to others that Africa will continue to
reject the illegal seizure of power from governments who have been
democratically elected,'' Nzo said.
	   Nzo said South Africa would provide humanitarian assistance to
the war-torn country

Lords' attendants use hacksaw to release young American from
</HEADLINE>
chamber  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 6-year-old American boy is unlikely to forget
his trip to the Houses of Parliament. But then, nobody else is
either: He had to be cut free from the House of Lords' public
gallery with a hacksaw.
	   Officers from the Black Rod's office, responsible for order in
the royal palace, said young Stevenson Smith from Utah got his
finger stuck in a brass ring on his seat while watching a debate in
Britain's upper chamber Wednesday.
	   After his embarrassed parents notified the attendants, heroic
efforts to free him ensued.
	   ``We tried all the usual methods: soap, water, ice, washing-up
liquid. He was well stuck,'' said Ronnie Waugh, a doorkeeper in
Black Rod's department.
	   Meanwhile, in the debating chamber, their lordships continued to
consider the merits of a Welsh assembly, completely missing the
mini-crisis in the public gallery above their heads.
	   While the debate continued, Waugh and two colleagues unscrewed
the ring _ and Stevenson _ from the gallery's benches and took the
boy to the engineers' control room, where they cut the ring using a
hacksaw.
	   ``We sawed it off _ not the finger _ the bracket,'' joked Waugh,
who noted that Stevenson remained calm throughout.
	   Stevenson then got to take home a cool souvenir: the ring.
	   Black Rod officials said they did not know where in Utah his
family came from.

So far, so good
All of a sudden it has started raining good news I am not

<TEXT>
referring to the rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange Index, nor to
the sudden jump in foreign exchange reserves. I have serious doubts
about the credibility of stock exchange indices that appear to have
no relation with price/earning ratios and which go up when all
prospects look bleak. We will shortly know why foreign investors
have suddenly developed an interest in the Indian share market and
the result may be less than happy.
	   The first good news is that the new prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee said on 6 April, 1998 that the state of the economy of the
country was worrisome and that some very hard decision would have
to be taken in the near future. That would be music to the ears of
a handful like us who have been persistently warning that the
country's economy is inevitably moving towards a major disaster.
	   All through the election campaign, Vajpayee avoided talking on
his party's gameplan for meeting a South Asia-like situation. It's
good news if he has realised that politics is not all about
temples, common civil codes and Article 370. He has not spelt out
what kind of hard decision he thinks would be on the agenda except
that the fiscal deficit will be strictly controlled. That will
involve ruthless slashing of the whole forest of rules and
regulations of the late unlamented licence-permit raj. The
administrative costs will have to be reduced. Employees of the
state governments will soon start agitating for parity in
remuneration with Central government employees. Will Vajpayee have
the courage to face them and do what the leftist Chinese prime
minister did in one stroke -- do away with a dozen ministries and a
million posts? Can he liberalise the exit policy so that there will
be some discipline in the industry? Doesn't appear likely.
	   The import of 1.5 million tonnes of wheat at a landed cost of
over Rs700 per quintal ordered by the predecessor UF government has
brought down the domestic prices to below Rs500 per quintal. A
government that talks 'swadeshi' is all ready to favour videshi
wheat. Will the PM dare to take on the PDS lobby and cancel the
import order? All very tough decisions. But it is good news that
Vajpayee has awakened to the fact that prime ministership is an
awesome burden and responsibility.
	   The second good news comes from the finance minister, Yashwant
Sinha. A recent convert to BJP, Sinha vociferously defended the
swadeshi plank along with the Gurumurthys and Georges. ``Inflow of
capital and technology is all right for priority sectors like
infrastructure and energy, but not for non-priority sectors like
food-processing.'' ``Nobody needs to teach us how to fry a potato''
was the line of his colleague in the defence ministry. But, Sinhaji
is a transformed man now. He has suddenly awakened to the fact that
India has a large agriculture base and needs to go into
food-processing in a big way. He now recognises that
food-processing is high technology and, therefore, is prepared to
welcome even the MNCs, provided all the production is exported. The
proviso only means that Sinha has yet to find his feet. But that he
has abandoned the pointless polemics on priority and non-priority
sectors is a good beginning.
	   Deregulation with riders Another good piece of news comes from
the veteran leftist and expert from ministry of Agriculturist
'stable', C.H. Hanumantha Rao. His committee on fertilisers pricing
has recommended deregulation of the fertiliser industry, in
principle. He has added a number of complicated riders on the new
methodology for fixing prices and retention prices. It's a joke
that he recommends deregulation and also a high level Fertiliser
Policy Planning Board. But that is understandable. Socialism or
deregulation, experts have their wives and children to feed! And
finally, the good tidings come from the bastion of cooperative
statism. The National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories
has finally opted for decontrol, albeit conditional. The federation
is not quite for delicensing, for it admits too many units have
been licensed. But the new units must continue to benefit from the
protection of high cost incentives. Further, the zoning system
which gives every sugar factory exclusive monopoly over an area
must continue. So everything will continue as it is but it will be
called decontrol. That Shivajirao Patil has accepted to speak of
decontrol is itself a minor miracle.
	   So, people are changing. The only question for the liberals is,
``With friends like these who needs enemies?''
	   Moral: Nobody is ever so lost as to be beyond hope. SHARAD JOSHI

Three of the biggest companies in the country yesterday

<TEXT>
vehemently protested that they were paying correct taxes to the
national government.
	   San Miguel Corp. (SMC), Petron Corp., and Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT), all blue chip companies listed at
the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), reacted to reports that their
finances were about to come under close scrutiny by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue (BIR).
	   The agency had earlier stated it would conduct an audit of at
least 10 big corporate taxpayers which registered a sharp drop in
their tax payments in the first quarter of 1998.
	   The three firms' response came by way of a statement to PSE
authorities who reportedly had inquired about their drastically
lower tax remittances during the first quarter.
	   The BIR had earlier revealed a drop in income tax payments of 10
corporations, namely: Petron, P578.88 million; PLDT, P548.12
million; Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc., P264.68 million;
Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), P248.3 million; SMC, P185.02
million; FR Cement Corp., P150.14 million; Solid Corp., P147.79
million; Goodyear Philippines, P96.43 million; Pilipinas Shell
Petroleum Corp., P86.14 million; and United Coconut Planters Bank,
P67.8 million.
	   What Audit? -- BREAKER Food and beverage giant SMC said
yesterday it had in fact paid higher taxes for last year and the
first quarter of the year, thereby denying a newspaper report (not
The Business Daily) that it was being audited by the BIR as a
result of its small tax payment.
	   SMC told the PSE that it paid P13.1 billion in taxes for 1997,
up from P12.2 billion in 1996, mainly due to the increase in the
excise tax rate.
	   For the first quarter of the year, SMC said it remitted P35.8
million in income tax against zero in the year-earlier period. The
tax was paid on its June 1 due date.
	   SMC Senior Vice President and General Counsel Francis Jardaleza
maintained the company has not been remiss on its tax payment
responsibility.
	   ``Income tax payment made by SMC during the first quarter of
1998 was for the remaining balance due for the year 1997, with
partial payments having been made at the end of each of the first
three quarters,'' Jardaleza said.
	   ``We confirm that SMC's income tax for the taxable year 1997
considerably decreased compared with income tax for the taxable
year 1996. The decline in taxable income for 1997 resulted from a
confluence of factors such as higher excise taxes, rollback in beer
prices, and higher cost of funds,''
	   Jardaleza added.
	   SMC was joined in its effort to counteract what it perceived to
be negative publicity by Petron, the country's largest oil refiner.
	   The firm not only stated it had paid the correct amount of taxes
but took the occasion to pointedly remind that it was government
that owed a large amount of money to the oil firm.
	   ``Petron has not been remiss in the payment of its obligations.
In fact for the past five years, Petron has paid a total of P78.80
billion in taxes and duties due to the national government. On the
contrary, Petron has a huge overdue receivable from various
government agencies consisting of oil price stabilization fund
(OPSF) receivable and claims,'' the oil firm's statement said.
	   Meanwhile, PLDT Senior Executive Vice-President Enriquez Perez
brought up the rear by stating that the BIR had not been in
communication with the firm, at the same time denying reports of a
planned audit of his company's finances.
	   Stopping Tax Leakage -- BREAKER This developed after incoming
Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Edgardo B. Espiritu had
repeatedly signalled his intention to make government's tax
collection program a top prority In a recent interview with The
Business Daily, Espiritu was quoted as saying ``keeping a closer
watch on big taxpayers will be a key element of our drive.''
	   ``We are committed toward improving tax collection. We will
expand coverage to include the top 2,000 corporations. They may be
the highest taxpayers in the country, but there is still a lot of
leakage,'' Espiritu added.
	   Espiritu further elaborated on his intentions to have the BIR
conduct special examinations of the finances of the top 200
corporations in the country.
	   ``We want to assign permanent examiners to evaluate day-to-day
transactions of these companies and then rationalize everything by
creating one group of examiners who will examine all companies
belonging to one conglomerate, regardless of the business,''
Espiritu said.
	   The measure is aimed at disciplining companies with respect to
their bookkeeping.
	   While acknowledging that the economic slowdown could have played
a major part in the drop in tax remittances, DOF and BIR officials
had nevertheless hinted that they had less than complete faith in
corporate compliance with tax laws.
	   A DOF source, not discounting the possibility of tax evasion,
said government was set to investigate the drastic 33.5% decrease
in tax remittances in the first quarter.
	   ``It cannot be done in 10 days. The audit requires three
months,'' the source said The BIR reported that for the first three
months of the year, it managed to collect only P2.11 billion from
corporate taxes, P1.613 billion lower than its P3.726 billion
target for period.
	   The failure of government to meet revenue targets has resulted
in missed fiscal targets as agreed upon with the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Because of authorities' inability to meet fiscal targets, the
IMF decided to postpone completion of its review of the country's
economic performance for the first quarter of this year. Copyright

Taxi driver gets 20 years for Frenchwoman's murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) - A taxi driver was sentenced Thursday to
20 years in jail for the murder of a French tourist.
	   Kyriakos Zanas, 37, had confessed to shooting Jacqueline
Francois Chomik, 49, of Lyon, shortly after picking her up at the
airport to drive her to her hotel on Christmas day last year.
	   Zanas said he shot Chomik four times after an argument and
dumped her body in a dry well.
	   The body was found two months later after another taxi driver
tipped off police. Zanas was arrested and charged with her murder
after DNA tests of bloodstains in the trunk of his taxi matched
Chomik's.
	   Judge Efi Papadopoulou, who passed the ruling, branded Zana's
action as ``atrocious'' and ``something which can only cause
revulsion.''

Switzerland rejects call for task force chief to step down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Thursday rejected an
Israeli lawmaker's demand for the resignation of the damage-control
diplomat heading the Swiss ``task force'' on the country's wartime
role over anti-Semitic remarks he allegedly made.
	   Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Franz Egle said Avraham
Hirschson's call for Thomas Borer to resign was not even ``under
discussion.''
	   Hirschson, chairman of an Israeli parliamentary panel on
restitution for Holocaust victims, sent a letter to Swiss President
Flavio Cotti Thursday saying Borer should either ``apologize,
clarify his statement or resign'' for remarks allegedly made on
Israeli radio during Cotti's trip to Israel last month.
	   According to Hirschson, Borer said during an interview that the
demands of World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman and other
leaders of Jewish organizations for cash compensation to Holocaust
victims from the Swiss were ``disgusting.''
	   Hirschson told The Associated Press Thursday he had been
approached by Holocaust survivors who found the alleged remarks
anti-Semitic and deeply offensive.
	   ``They asked me why I had not reacted. Borer must be aware that
the accountants have found the dormant accounts alone amount to
billions of dollars,'' Hirschson said.
	   ``I think Borer's statement was quite inappropriate for a man
charged with a mission which is so sensitive to the Jews, as well
as the Swiss.''
	   Egle said Borer firmly rejected the accusations. Borer took
every opportunity to condemn anti-Semitism in the strongest
possible terms, he added.

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews expecting to find more
bodies labored to disentangle a high-speed train from the wreckage
of a bridge Thursday, while speculation about the cause of
Germany's worst post-war rail disaster extended several kilometers
(miles) down the line.
	   Deutsche Bahn took all 60 of its first-generation InterCity
Express trains out of service as they finished their runs Thursday,
idling more than half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   At least 100 people died, according to Lower Saxony state
officials, when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 crashed and
broke apart at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning
in Eschede, a small town 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said. Forty-three trains built since 1996 remain in service, and it
was unclear how rapidly normal service would resume.

The tariff and related matters committee has trimmed down to 450

<TEXT>
the number of agriculture products and capital goods that importers
may bring in at a preferential 3% tariff.
	   ``We have to safeguard the budget so we listed down the
commodities that will be granted incentives,'' assistant Finance
Secretary Gil Beltran said in an interview yesterday.
	   Beltran said the tariff committee wanted to ensure government
would recover revenues it would lose from incentives provided under
the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act.
	   He said not all products included in the expanded list were
purely for agriculture. Trucks and packaging materials, he said,
could be used both by farmers and factories.
	   Despite the safeguard, however, the Department of Finance
estimated government would still lose some P7.3 billion from
products to be covered by the 3% tariff.
	   Besides a preferential duty, other perks granted under the
Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization are income-tax holidays,
deduction of labor expenses, tax credits on locally-acquired
capital equipment and exemption from the real property tax.
	   Among the products and commodities that the tariff committee has
allowed to enter the country at 3% are corn seed, fertilizers,
refrigerated vans, air-conditioners and tractors.
	   Importation of these commodities alone would already lead to a
P1.6-billion reduction in government earnings, said Beltran.
	   The finance department has blamed incentives granted to
investors as one of the factors contributing to the lower revenue
collection of the Bureau of Customs.
	   Beltran said earlier non-dutiable commodities had gone up to 60%
this year from 40% last year.

Mir docks with U.S. shuttle
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to ADD quotes.  
  By ANNA DOLGOV  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station docked Thursday with
the U.S. space shuttle Discovery, which was sent to pick up
astronaut Andrew Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on
Mir.
	   The docking appeared to go flawlessly, and was greeted by
applause at Mission Control just outside Moscow.
	   ``Just as when you see two old friends when they first meet and
they shake hands and embrace each other, I think you've seen two
old friends meet in space, the shuttle and Mir,'' said NASA flight
director Chuck Shaw. ``They shake hands and embrace each other when
they dock.''
	   Earlier, space officials had said Mir was in ``perfect order''
and ready to relay TV pictures of its rendezvous with Discovery,
whose communications system is out of order.
	   ``You will have the exclusive rights for TV coverage,'' a ground
controller joked while telling Mir's crew about Discovery's
problem.
	   Discovery hooked up with Mir precisely on schedule at 9 p.m.
Moscow time (1700 GMT) and is to remain linked to the station for
four days.
	   ``The seventh and, unfortunately, the last docking under the
Mir-Shuttle program has been successfully accomplished,'' said
Vladimir Solovyov, chief of Mission Control.
	   Because of a failure of an antenna in Discovery's communication
system, live images of the docking and the meeting of two crews
came only from Mir's cameras, said Russian Mission Control
spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova.
	   Mir has been running smoothly since Monday, when cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin fixed a three-day computer
breakdown which disabled the station's steering system and
threatened to delay the docking.
	   ``All the station's systems are now in perfect order,''
Medvedkova told The Associated Press. ``We are fully ready for the
docking.''
	   Mir's main computer failed on Saturday, leaving the station
unstable and its energy supply in jeopardy if its solar panels lost
their alignment with the sun.
	   Computer breakdowns plagued the aging space outpost all through
1997, and the previous shuttle ferry flight in January brought a
new computer which had worked trouble-free until Saturday's
failure. The crew used another back-up computer and other spares to
fix the problem.
	   Medvedkova said the crew woke up three hours later than usual
Thursday to adjust their schedule to that of Discovery. They spent
the time before the docking packing science gear used by Thomas and
his six NASA predecessors.

METROVISION must take a bow for broadcasting quality shows such

<TEXT>
as Seinfeld and Frasier. However, before the station gets too
swollen-headed, it must assess the surfeit of nonsense in the
sitcom Jenny. (Tuesdays, 10.30pm).
	   Jenny is MetroVision's worst nightmare. The May 12 episode, A
Girl's Gotta Get It, was the most boring 30 minutes I have ever
spent in front of the idiot box.
	   Jenny (Jenny McCarthy) and housemate Maggie (Heather Page Kent)
work in a photocopy shop. Jenny is asked to copy a handsome man's
movie script. On the bus, she accidentally leaves it in a
passenger's bag.
	   Jenny and Maggie go to retrieve the script from the passenger's
house; he just happens to be a producer of B-grade movies. The
producer, who realises the script is his ticket to stardom, refuses
to return it. The intrepid duo then resorts to chicanery to get it
back.
	   It was more interesting listening to the canned laughter than
watching the actors.
	   McCarthy plays Jenny McMillan, a small-town girl working in a
convenience store with Maggie in the State of New York. Jenny finds
out her father has died and left her his house in Los Angeles. The
women immediately head west.
	   Jenny debuted in the US last year.
	   The script puts the women in absurd situations, but it never
rises above the mediocre. You feel sorry for the actors who have to
labour through uninspiring and stilted dialogue.
	   McCarthy and Kent work hard contorting their faces and trying
every possible gesture, but their enthusiasm can do only so much.
	   It's B-grade actors working with C-grade dialogue.
	   Jenny reinforces the stereotype of the dumb blonde. The
protagonist is muddled, unable to cope with the swirl of activity
around her. If this is how Jenny sees the life of a twentysomething
woman in the 1990s, it doesn't bode well for society.

KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Rural Development Ministry is

<TEXT>
developing four remote Orang Asli villages with potential for
agro-tourism.
	   The villages are in Kuala Mu and Baung in Perak and Sanwai and
Pos Broke in Kelantan, its director-general for community
development (Kemas) Zainal Karib Abdul Rahim said.
	   ``The ministry wants to encourage the Orang Asli to be involved
in income-generating activities, through the use of their own
skills and resources.
	   ``We are assisting the villagers to beautify their surroundings
and also provide the facilities for handicrafts and other cottage
industries, and marketing their produce,'' he said.
	   Zainal Karib was speaking to reporters after a two-hour meeting
between Minister Datuk Annuar Musa and Kemas State directors today.
	   He said the four villages were among hundreds of Orang Asli
settlements which lacked basic infrastructure and amenities as they
were inaccessible.
	   ``Besides having orchards and farms, they are also skilful
craftsmen.
	   ``We are providing electricity and water to the four villages.
As they cannot be connected to the national power grid, they are
supplied with solar-generated electricity. Water is supplied by
tubewell.''
	   On education, Zainal Karib said Kemas would appoint teachers
from among the Orang Asli to set up kindergartens.

German rail officials pull 60 high-speed trains from service
</HEADLINE>
  URGENT  
  Eds: COMBINES Urgent series  

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Federal rail officials on Thursday
announced they were taking out of service its first-generation
high-speed trains for inspections as a precaution after a deadly
train crash in northern Germany.
	   Rail spokesman Martin Katz said all 60 InterCity Express trains
were being pulled immediately.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' Katz said.
	   The train that careened out of control Wednesday morning in the
northern German town of Eschede was part of the fleet of
first-generation ICE trains that began operation in 1991.
	   Officials are still at a loss to explain what caused the train
to crash, derailing and slamming into a concrete overpass, killing
at least 100 people.
	   Rail officials earlier ordered all high-speed trains, including
43 from the second-generation, to reduce speeds to 160 kilometers
(100 miles) an hour pending inspections. The trains are capable of
hitting top speeds of 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour.
	   The decision to pull the 60 trains was sure to cause disarray
along 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) of rail served by Germany's
premier high-speed trains, launched in 1991.
	   ``We plan on trains' being delayed, but we will ask people to
understand as we feel this is necessary for their safety,'' Katz
said.
	   Trains will finish runs already in progress, and be taken out of
service at the final destination, Katz said. He did not say how
long it would take to complete the inspections.
	   InterCity Express trains carry an average of 65,000 passengers a
day along four routes connecting 150 cities.

KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Petaling Jaya Utara MP Vincent Lim told

<TEXT>
the High Court today he lodged a complaint against a consultant
architect with the Malaysian Board of Architects regarding the
construction of an additional floor at the Damansara Kim Specialist
Hospital.
	   He said he also lodged a similar complaint against the
construction engineers with the Institution of Engineers.
	   ``I lodged the complaints following numerous grouses from
residents in Damansara in connection with the additional floor
which was being constructed without prior approval from the
authorities.''
	   He said the architects, Perunding Alam Bina Sdn Bhd, was
investigated by the Board of Architects but no action was taken.
	   He was giving evidence in a defamation suit by Perunding Alam
Bina against the New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Bhd and four
others over two articles which it claimed meant that the company
was unprofessional, unethical, negligent and privy to the
construction of the illegal floor at the hospital.
	   The other four defendants are reporter Errol Oh, former reporter
Teoh Teik Hoong, the editor of The Malay Mail Mohd Fauzi Omar and
the chief news editor of the New Straits Times Tony Francis. The
defendants are represented by Robert Lazaar and Felix Raj.
	   Perunding Alam Bina, represented by N. Navaratnam and Rueben
Mathiavaranam, claimed the articles were published under the
headings ``Act indirectly proposal - way to handle unprofessional
architects and engineers, says MP'' and ``Hospital developer yet to
demolish illegal floor''
	   in The Malay Mail on Dec 4, 1995, and the NST on Dec 22, 1995,
respectively.
	   Perunding Alam Bina is claiming RM20 million for special damages
as well as general damages, interest and costs.
	   The defendants claimed the articles did not refer to Perunding
Alam Bina but were applied to all professionals involved in the
construction industry and the developer of the hospital who had
failed to demolish the illegal floor.
	   Lim also said that he did make the statements as reported in the
two articles.
	   Earlier, Oh said he knew about Lim's complaint as he had
accompanied Lim when the complaint was made.
	   He said he knew that the additional floor was illegally erected
as he was informed by the Damansara Utama State Assemblywoman Dr
Oon Hong Geok.
	   ``Dr Oon also told me a stop-work order was issued by the
Petaling Jaya Municipal Council to stop the construction of the
floor. I also verified this with the council and the hospital
project manager.''
	   Hearing continues.

SEPANG, Tues. - Malaysia Airlines will provide shuttle buses to

<TEXT>
ferry its employees from its administrative offices in Subang to
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport when it opens fully for
commercial operations on June 30.
	   The shuttle will operate for the first two weeks to help
employees overcome problems in getting to their new base, which is
about 50km from Kuala Lumpur.
	   Senior vice-president (KLIA operations) Captain Mohd Kamil Abu
Bakar said about 12,000 cabin crew members and operations employees
will be moving base to KLIA.
	   ``There will be about 10 shuttle buses operating round the
clock,'' he said.
	   Speaking to reporters after the airline's fourth equipment
moving operation to the RM10.5 billion airport from the Sultan
Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang, Kamil said the
shuttle service would be continued if it was felt necessary to do
so.
	   Malaysia Airlines today shifted 179 pieces of heavy equipment to
its engineering apron at the KLIA. The items included towing
tractors, ground power units, engine stands, generators and cranes.
	   A convoy of 56 heavily-laden vehicles comprising vans, low
loaders, trailers and cranes left Hangar 4 in Subang at noon. It
was accompanied by police outriders.
	   Kamil said all the heavy equipment arrived safely at KLIA,
although the operations were delayed for about an hour at Subang.
	   The airline has employed a local company, Wirapac, to handle the
movement to the new base. The operations started on April 15.
	   Kamil said today's operations were part of the nine movement
packages involving 12 departments which include catering, flight
operations, reservations, cargo, line maintanance, security and
medical services, bonded items and engineering spares.
	   So far there have been four transfer operations from one package
involving ground support equipment.
	   ``The second package involving engineering spares will commence
on June 8 and the cargo package will begin on June 23,'' Kamil
said.
	   About five per cent of the the airline's equipment to be located
at KLIA has been moved. The largest part of the move will take
place on the evening of June 29.
	   ``We will be moving about 60 per cent of the equipment on the
night before the first departure and arrival at the airport at
about 7am the next morning.''
	   Kamil said the strategy of the migration was to move first
whatever equipment was not needed in Subang, and leave behind only
the ``critical''
	   ones essential for the airline's operations.
	   ``We are now moving whatever spare equipment we have in
Subang,'' he said.
	   He said further details on the airline's migration operations
would be released later.
	   Malaysia Airlines, being the largest single operator at KLIA, is
also conducting flight operation trials to test the airport's
baggage, passenger and aircraft handling systems.

SINCE the present president of the Kajang Municipal Council Mohd

<TEXT>
Yusup Badul took office, there has been much improvement with
regard to cleanliness. Among them is the requirement for all
premises to have proper dustbins.
	   But the council seems to have overlooked a very important aspect
of having dustbins at strategic points for solid waste disposal.
	   As a result, hawkers and outsiders have resorted to throwing
waste packages into bushes, drains, etc making them difficult to be
noticed and posing a health hazard.
	   Other areas in which the council can improve upon are the town
drains and the backyard of the wet market. The drains, especially
around the famous satay stalls stink and make it an unpleasant
experience for the patrons.
	   This might also give a negative impression of our country to
foreigners.
	   I would suggest that the council make use of the water tankers
previously used for watering roadside plants to flush out the town
drains and the backyard of the wet market on alternate days or once
a week.
	   The satay stallholders and the chicken sellers at the wet market
can be charged a monthly levy for this service.
	   Let us make Kajang a clean and beautiful town.

With all the attention showered on him, one must remember that

<TEXT>
Joseph Estrada has just been handed a sparkling new blank sheet of
paper to rewrite the history of a nation. None of the last 12
presidents has had such a clear mandate amid a veritable absence of
challenge to his leadership or programs. Notably, in the context,
was that his plan to allow the transfer of the body of former
President Ferdinand Marcos to the Libingan ng Mga Bayani was met
with surprisingly muted opposition and not the usual outcries Many
rate his performance up to this point as exceeding expectations.
	   Almost palpable is the breath of relief sighed by shrewd
businessmen as well as ivory-tower economists. Oddball politicians
have suspended their schemes for now, while NGOs and assorted
militant groups are busily juxtaposing. Strange indeed, and makes
me ask four silly questions.
	   Is everyone by now expecting too much from him? Will he burn out
during the break-in period? How long will the honeymoon last? The
fourth question is . . . why am I so negative?
	   Largely disregarding spin-doctoring speechwriters, Estrada's
recent pronouncements have demonstrated a keen understanding of the
essence of his hefty winning margin. These five million votes
represent a concerted groan for social justice, dignity, and decent
livelihood. The sound must have pierced his eardrums to lodge in
his brain when he traveled the country from one barrio to another.
	   On the third day after the election, as the numbers continued to
pile up in his favor, he knew that he had been chosen to take the
loneliest job available in the country and thus had to come to
terms with his response.
	   His live-on-the-radio talk with Korina Sanchez the week after
revealed his internal battles - 75 million lives equal 75 million
destinies. Each one counts.
	   Estrada is used to leadership. His past does not haunt him any
longer.
	   Rallying people to solve the looming economic crises is a
comparatively simple task. Sectoral and national interests can be
readily realigned, as the general sentiment is for unity and
sacrifice in the interest of the nation. To raise funds for the
administration, tariffs on non-essential goods can be raised while
irrational duty-free priviledges are either withdrawn or limited to
foreign travellers based on a quid pro quo arrangement. Agencies
such as the MMDA should not be allowed any longer to deploy eight
(even if it is a lucky number) persons to remove posters from a few
yards of concrete wall, or to manage a simple intersection.
	   To arrive at permanent solutions, the larger challenge is to
effect the structural reforms that have eluded his predecessors.
The banking system needs to be reoriented to provide competitive
lending rates at between 3% and 9% annually. Utilities in private
hands must cease to be licenses for profiteering through some of
the highest rates in the solar system. Maybe one should consider
converting empty shopping malls into factories.
	   The policy to make service-oriented business the pillar of our
economy must be trashed, being valid for a tiny city-state like
Singapore, but not for a nation the size of ours. The eternal
enmity between labor and capital must be transformed into a
partnership, starting with a transparent review of the Labor Code.
Likewise, concern for the ballooning informal sector must be made a
priority of the labor department over and above organized labor.
	   This is where the poorest of the poor are and they comprise more
than 81.9% of our total labor force. The neglect is no longer
tolerable.
	   Asean is seeking new leaders to give globalization a social
face. It can not be that millions are sent to the slaughterhouse of
poverty due to disenfranchisement as a result of ``market forces''
allowed to run wild.
	   East Asia has its own flashpoints and the country may need to
perform certain balancing acts. China can eventually be expected to
invade Taiwan once the patience of the army runs out, while Japan
may resort to a military buildup to reverse a possibly
uncontrollable economic downturn.
	   On the national level, Estrada is expected to preside over the
conflict between a re-emerging Marcosian party with the post-EDSA
leaders. His election financiers will likely move to recover their
investment and prepare for elections in 2001 and beyond. By then,
the global electronic integration would have been completed and the
country has had only a few years to catch up or slide into the
Fourth World category.
	   Our policies on foreign direct investments (FDI) must be
reorganized to ensure profitability through incentives - or more
accurately termed -subsidies. The first concern of a foreign
investor is security. Without a stable industrial strategy and an
acceptable degree of internal per-capita productivity, a country is
treated as a high risk area. Without safety guarantees, nobody will
invest in industrial or infrastructure projects of long gestation.
Instead, they will play with portfolio investments (currencies,
stocks or real estate) or engage in assembly operations (extremely
high sales turnover vis-a-vis fixed investments).
	   No foreigner in his right mind would sink long-term funds into a
rotten economy. Hence, the only recourse is to appeal to domestic
investors and it is incredibly stupid to discriminate against them.
Our situation is not necessarily hopeless, mind you. Internally,
the system is liquid and the private sector has a lot of capital.
The key issue is how to redirect resources away from
service-oriented projects which only serve to increase the speed of
money circulation and create illusory prosperity. Instead, the
capital should flow into industrial undertakings that will add
value to the economy in real terms.
	   The psychological make-up of the election was a direct measure
of the maturity of the populace. On the threshold of graduating
into a new century, the Filipino has finally made a choice that
reflects his own identity after generations of assaults and
insults. The centennial scars have healed into the pattern of a
centennial emblem. By itself, centennial pride has become a
rallying cry for the nation's future. The history of the Filipino
people has finally begun.

I REFER to the front page story (NST, May 29), regarding what

<TEXT>
the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said about the
free market system.
	   He has correctly come to a conclusion that the system must be
re-evaluated in the light of what is happening not only in our
country and the region but globally as well.
	   America, Europe and other countries seemingly untouched by the
current economic problem will eventually feel the impact as well
because of the globalisation or intertwining of economies.
	   It should be recognised that globalisation gives a false sense
of well being when times are good but just the opposite when times
are bad.
	   Yes, the system has to be examined but we have to go beyond
that. There is one important factor that we ignore at our own peril
- people who make or break a system. It is people who abuse the
system for their own selfish ends.
	   So any examination must go to the root of the problem - the
policies and instruments that frame the system and the thinking
that goes into such a framework.
	   Policy-makers will have to examine the very basis of their work.
	   And unless people as a whole change the way they think and act
in relation to their surroundings, no system they put in place (let
it be feudalism, capitalism or socialism) will achieve the desired
results.
	   Simply put, we must recognise our own flaws before we formulate.
We must also recognise that given our shortcomings no man-made
system will ever be perfect.

Colin Montgomerie takes first-round lead in English Open
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS Mongtomerie quotes, details  

<TEXT>
	   WARE, England (AP) _ Scotland's Colin Montgomerie shot his best
score of the season _ an 8-under-64 _ to take the first-round lead
Thursday in the English Open.
	   Playing around the tight, tough rough of the 7,016-yard Marriott
Hanbury Manor course, the Scot showed his game is in shape to make
a run at this month's U.S. Open, where he'll be seeking his first
victory in a major.
	   Montgomerie, in only his sixth event this season on the European
tour, was named player of the month in May for winning the Volvo
PGA Championship and could go to the top the Euro money list if he
wins here.
	   He has won that title five consecutive times.
	   ``This is fantastic,'' said Montgomeire, referring not to his
score but to the way the course was set up.
	   ``I really do wish that we were punished for a bad shot more
often. Too often still (in Europe) we don't have the punishment for
a bad shot.
	   ``This is a course set up for myself and certain people who hit
the ball straight. This is perfect preparation for the U.S. Open.''
	   Montgomerie missed tying the course record of 63 shot last
season by American Jay Townsend.
	   European tour newcomer Nicolas Joakimides of France shot a
7-under par 65, one stroke off the pace. Three players were tied at
6-under: Nicolas Vanhootegem of Belgium, Stephen Leaney of
Australia and Jon Robson of England.
	   Andrew Coltart of Scotland and Robert Allenby shot 5-under 67s
and were three strokes back in the 650,000-pound (dlrs 1.05
million) event.

RECENT newspaper reports have highlighted what seems to be a

<TEXT>
growing problem involving the misuse of banned or controlled drugs
in animal husbandry.
	   It is reassuring to note that the Government is taking a serious
view of this matter and is introducing new legislation to regulate
such activities.
	   It is equally obvious that if there is a need to pass new laws,
then the problem must be quite widespread and not isolated.
	   If that is the case, it is unlikely that any one of us would
have been able to avoid consuming meat tainted with banned
substances like beta-agonist or human antibiotics like
chloramphenicol.
	   I practically live on fast food. As such, I'm anxious to know
whether the situation has affected the fast food outlets as well
since they get their supply of meat, particularly chicken, from
local breeders.
	   What is being done to prevent these breeders from supplying
drug-tainted meat to the fast food outlets?
	   As I understand it, beta-agonist is being used by livestock
breeders as a growth stimulant while antibiotics like
chloramphenicol is being administered to the animals to prevent
infections.
	   The authorities have already warned that beta-agonist can lead
to ill-effects in humans.
	   They have also spoken out against the use of human antibiotics
in animals, saying they would develop resistance to treatment drugs
in consumers of the meat.
	   Of late, I have been rather hesitant to eat meat or patronise
any fast food outlets as the meat they serve may not be
``drug-free''.
	   I now seek some assurances from these fast food franchises about
the meat they serve.

The recent 20% adjustment in cargohandling fees for

<TEXT>
containerized cargo and 10% for breakbulk shipments would still
have pushed through had the measure been completed as scheduled.
	   The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) has shelved the
finalization of the cost-based tariff methodology which was
supposed to be implemented in the third to fourth quarter of last
year.
	   Well-placed sources told The Business Daily yesterday that port
officials have lost interest in pursuing plans to complete the
scheme.
	   ``During their meetings for the past months, it has never been
discussed. It was just covered by other concerns,'' one source
said.
	   Another source said the recent 20% adjustment in cargohandling
fees for containerized cargo and 10% for breakbulk shipments would
still have pushed through had the measure been completed as
scheduled.
	   PPA officials earlier affirmed that the application of Asian
Terminals, Inc. (ATI) and International Container Terminal Services
Inc. (ICTSI) for a 25% rate increase was only favored partly. This
was on top of the 20% increase that took effect in January.
	   ATI is the sole cargohandling services provider of Manila South
Harbor while ICTSI is the exclusive cargohandler of the Manila
International Container Terminal.
	   The tariff-adjustment scheme was part of the deal PPA and
portworkers entered into in the middle of 1997, forged following
the latter's strike at the Manila North Harbor.
	   Government conceded to the demand of the National Union of
Portworkers in the Philippines (NUPP) to adopt the scheme which
immediately adjusts arrastre and stevedoring rates in cases of an
oil price hike, wage increase, and the like.
	   NUPP members agreed to call off the one-day work stoppage after
the Association of North Harbor Cargohandling Operators promised to
pay them their backwages and other benefits.
	   Moreover, government had been warned that dock operations in
North Harbor would be paralyzed anew by NUPP if the former failed
to finalize the methodology within three months.
	   North Harbor Manager Aristedes Alcalde, who pioneered the
scheme, was not available for comment.
	   It can be recalled that Alcalde convened port users like the
Philippine Confederation of Exporters, Distribution Management
Association of the Philippines, Philippine Chamber of Arrastre and
Stevedoring Operators, as well as the Department of Trade and
Industry in formulating the scheme.
	   Sources said the commercial services department of PPA had
assumed the responsibility of finalizing the scheme.

I WISH to express my views on the increasingly disappointing

<TEXT>
attitude and bad manners that seem to have become a way of life in
our society: One example is parking.
	   From the Selayang-Kepong road where the Summit Square and
Selayang Mall are located up to the Kepong-Bandar Sri Damansara
road where Desa Kompleks is located, and to the main surrounding
roads of the One Utama Shopping centre, vehicle owners park
inconsiderately along the main road right up to the dividers/road
shoulders, at bus-stops and petrol stations nearby, just to save
one ringgit parking fee.
	   Such haphazard parking hinders traffic flow, causes accidents,
inconvenience and annoyance to other motorists.
	   The authorities should not hesitate to issue summonses to these
inconsiderate motorists.
	   Shopping There is currently a dispute between the Malaysian
Retailers Association and the recording companies regarding the
copyright fees. As such, most shopping centres do not play music
any more on their public address systems.
	   In almost every department store and some restaurants that I
patronised in the past few months I have noticed that one's
shopping is disrupted by the ever-increasingly loud talking and ill
manners of the sales assistants and front-line personnel.
	   Some laugh and shout at each other across their work stations
and some even eat and distribute snacks while working.
	   Where have all the good manners gone? I remember a time when as
one of the first few customers of a popular department store the
sales personnel stood at the main entrance and wished us a ``Good
Morning'' with a humble bow.
	   Unfortunately, this same department store no longer follows the
rule. It now has supervisors, cashiers and sales assistants who
behave as if customers owe them a living.
	   Some even look at customers from head to toe before serving
them. There are those who continue chit-chatting and even pause to
listen to their colleagues or respond to their remarks at the
cashier counter whilst customers wait for their change.
	   Are we becoming like some countries I have visited in the Far
East where special treatment is only for customers who dress up
like millionaires?
	   The staff look at other customers with no regard because they do
not wear designer clothes, flash their wallets and load themselves
with one tonne of jewellery.
	   What happened to the gentle humility, politeness and
friendliness that we have been known for the world over?
	   In our haste to rush on with our daily lives, can we not strive
to carry our duties (where it involves dealing with the public)
without being a nuisance to others.
	   How are we going to become a caring society when all people care
about is themselves?

Moscow mayor says Muscovites are water hogs
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with Russian environment minister
saying Moscow environmentally unsafe city.  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mayor Yuri Luzhkov claimed Thursday that Moscow's
water was up to European and world standards, but that residents
were using far too much of it, a news agency reported.
	   Luzhkov's assertion about water quality might surprise many
residents, who filter their water or drink bottled water if they
can afford it and are used to periodically seeing a murky brown
flow from their taps.
	   It may also come as news to Russia's environment minister who
said Moscow was one of 80 environmentally unsafe cities in the
country.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the mayor said Moscow
spent 1 billion rubles (dlrs 166 million) on environmental programs
over the past 5 years, improving water quality and drastically
cutting the discharge of heavy metals and other toxic wastes in its
sewage.
	   He complained that Moscow residents are using water ``extremely
wastefully,'' with per capita consumption of 400 liters (106
gallons) a day. He said that was double the average in other large
European cities.
	   Luzhkov threatened to begin charging for excess use of water. At
present, Moscow residents do not pay for water.
	   It is not clear why they might be using more than residents of
other cities. The vast majority of Muscovites live in highrise
apartment buildings, giving them no private gardens to water.
	   Moreover, every spring they lose all hot water for a month while
the city cleans its heating plants, so water consumption drops
dramatically as many people largely forego bathing until the hot
water returns.
	   Russian Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilian said Moscow
had so much air pollution _ caused mainly by 1.5 million cars _
that trees planted on city streets could died within five years,
Interfax said.

A lawmaker yesterday asked the National Telecommunications

<TEXT>
Commission (NTC) to give Internet users free on-line time in view
of the metered-call system of the Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. (PLDT).
	   In a statement, Sen. Ramon Magsaysay Jr. said students,
teachers, professionals and businessmen should not be prevented
from using the Internet productively.
	   The Internet, also referred to as the ``World Wide Web,'' is a
global network of computers linked together by ``service
providers'' that use phone lines to receive and transmit data.
	   Local service providers have said PLDT's metered-call system
will jack up phone rates and discourage use of the Internet.
	   A study by the University of Asia and the Pacific showed that
while the metered-call system was reasonable for regular phone
users, it would have a negative impact on Internet users who use
the phone at least two hours a day.
	   Magsaysay, chair of the Senate trade and commerce committee,
noted Internet users in the US ``are given unlimited use of the
wired line in recognition of the vital contributions of the use of
the Internet to individuals, institutions or organizations in
furthering growth through the power of knowledge and technology.''
	   Late last year, the Philippine Internet Service Organization
sought to block PLDT's application for a license to operate a
metered-call system.
	   The group said the telecommunications giant failed to show the
operational, financial and marketing feasibility of its proposal.
	   The NTC, however, ruled in PLDT's favor, giving the company the
license to charge from P0.10 to P0.40 a minute in excess of the
allotted 800 minutes of free phone use for both residential and
business users.
	   PLDT is set to implement this scheme by April next year.
	   Magsaysay said the NTC should at least increase the free minutes
allotted per month.

IT was nice to read that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir

<TEXT>
Mohamad, while undergoing treatment for a blood clot at the ankle
happened to see from his hospital bed smoke billowing from a nearby
construction site and decided to do something.
	   He called Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law
Hieng Ding's handphone to complain.
	   I suppose, since the call was made by the country's leader,
action would have been taken immediately.
	   But every day we ordinary citizens notice open burning,
especially at construction sites, housing estates, plantations, and
some industries.
	   I wonder, if we are talking about responsibility of certain
enforcement agencies, if one has to wait for a report or complaint
to be made officially. I am sure most of the time smoke from fires,
or even dust can be seen a few kilometres away.
	   If even one of the agencies entrusted to act in cases of
environmental pollution notices the pollution, they would have no
reason to wait for someone especially the Prime Minister to
highlight such a situation.
	   After all it is their responsibility.
	   I am sure those enforcement officials who patrol the areas would
have realised that regardless of the haze situation one can see
open burning in most areas towards the evening or at dawn.
	   Calls were made regarding such cases but met with no positive
response.
	   And the Government itself has programmes to make Malaysians care
for the environment.
	   What we see now is that, when the haze gets worse everyone goes
overboard to get things under control, like asking people to
sprinkle water from highrise buildings (remember we have water
shortage now). When the haze has reduced slightly no one bothers to
even talk about it.
	   So I would like to ask the authorities to be more observant in
tackling the situation.
	   Oxygen is not taxed at the moment, so please do not make
Malaysians pay for oxygen cylinders.
	   Take care of the pure free air before it is too late.

Mir docks with U.S. shuttle
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with hatch opening.  
  By ANNA DOLGOV  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station docked Thursday with
the U.S. space shuttle Discovery, which was sent to pick up
astronaut Andrew Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on
Mir.
	   The docking appeared to go flawlessly, and was greeted by
applause at Mission Control just outside Moscow.
	   ``Just as when you see two old friends when they first meet and
they shake hands and embrace each other, I think you've seen two
old friends meet in space, the shuttle and Mir,'' said NASA flight
director Chuck Shaw. ``They shake hands and embrace each other when
they dock.''
	   Earlier, space officials had said Mir was in ``perfect order''
and ready to relay TV pictures of its rendezvous with Discovery,
whose communications system is out of order.
	   ``You will have the exclusive rights for TV coverage,'' a ground
controller joked while telling Mir's crew about Discovery's
problem.
	   Discovery hooked up with Mir precisely on schedule at 9 p.m.
Moscow time (1700 GMT) and is to remain linked to the station for
four days. The Mir hatch was opened about 90 minutes later, and
Thomas welcomed his fellow Americans by urging them in Russia to
``come in, come in.''
	   ``The seventh and, unfortunately, the last docking under the
Mir-Shuttle program has been successfully accomplished,'' said
Vladimir Solovyov, chief of Mission Control.
	   Because of a failure of an antenna in Discovery's communication
system, live images of the docking and the meeting of two crews
came only from Mir's cameras, said Russian Mission Control
spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova.
	   Mir has been running smoothly since Monday, when cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin fixed a three-day computer
breakdown which disabled the station's steering system and
threatened to delay the docking.
	   ``All the station's systems are now in perfect order,''
Medvedkova told The Associated Press. ``We are fully ready for the
docking.''
	   Mir's main computer failed on Saturday, leaving the station
unstable and its energy supply in jeopardy if its solar panels lost
their alignment with the sun.
	   Computer breakdowns plagued the aging space outpost all through
1997, and the previous shuttle ferry flight in January brought a
new computer which had worked trouble-free until Saturday's
failure. The crew used another back-up computer and other spares to
fix the problem.
	   Medvedkova said the crew woke up three hours later than usual
Thursday to adjust their schedule to that of Discovery. They spent
the time before the docking packing science gear used by Thomas and
his six NASA predecessors.

KUDOS to the gallant Thomas Cuppers.
The gallant display by the youthful force of Malaysian shuttlers

<TEXT>
has done the nation proud and has put us back on track as a force
to be reckoned with in badminton.
	   The players did their best and I am sure all sports-loving
Malaysians would agree.
	   They gave every team they met ``a run for their money''.
	   It was a pity that they could not rise to the occasion in the
finals against Indonesia although they tried their very best.
	   There were some very exciting and heart-stopping moments and I
am sure all Malaysians will agree that their commitment to the task
at hand was second to none.
	   I am sure the coaches are aware of the players' shortcomings and
would work to improve on those areas.
	   There is one thing which I would like to know from the Badminton
Association of Malaysia. Now that Roslin Hashim has been rated as a
``new found'' star does BAM realise the price he had to pay?
	   He came close to being dumped and almost saw his career put to
an abrupt end by the BAM simply because he was in a different camp.
It was through public support and sympathy that a fund was raised
to pay the fees required by BAM to revive his career.
	   Now that he has done the nation proud, would BAM reciprocate in
a gentlemanly manner by putting aside the money used to bail-out
Roslin in a trust fund for the development of youthful talent.
	   I know it is impossible for the BAM to pay back to the
individual/organisation that had helped Roslin, but by having a
trust fund and manage it properly, it would certainly be a good
gesture on the part of BAM to show that they have a heart.
	   There are many other players of Roslin's calibre somewhere in
the country. To the BAM, please scout around and let's have a pool
of talented players.

Drug conference to focus on combating money-laundering, developing
</HEADLINE>
alternate crops  
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Samper quote  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Curbing money-laundering and reducing
narcotics demand will be among the main themes of a U.N. drug
conference which opens next week, the U.N.'s chief drug control
officer said Thursday.
	   Leaders of drug-producing countries have argued that enforcement
measures and ``drug wars'' will be ineffectual unless those steps
are taken.
	   President Clinton will open the three-day ``Special Session on
the World Drug Problem'' with a speech Monday to the U.N. General
Assembly. Representatives of about 150 governments, including 35
heads of state or government, are also expected to attend.
	   They include French President Jacques Chirac, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer and
President Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   ``For the first time, we have the issue of demand reduction
included at the same level as other components of narcotics
control,'' Pino Arlacchi, head of the U.N. drug control office,
said.
	   Arlacchi said demand reduction includes measures to rehabilitate
addicts, discourage young people from taking drugs and ``a strategy
for an elimination or substantial reduction'' in the cultivation of
cannabis, poppies and other narcotic crops over 10 years by
offering alternative crops to farmers.
	   He said the European Community should expand its programs for
drug rehabilitation and developing countries should establish
treatment programs.
	   ``We think that the time has come to include some important
elements of the money-laundering issue,'' he added. ``We are
concerned about bank secrecy as an impediment to criminal
investigations worldwide and about the proliferation of tax havens
worldwide ... that provide secure havens and protection'' for drug
profits.
	   The goal will be to encourage individual national governments to
enact legislation in line with conference guidelines.
	   But critics have questioned whether the United Nations is
capable of mounting an effective program and whether the conference
will endorse an American-style ``war on drugs,'' which has failed
to achieve success.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in Bogota, Colombia,
Samper said his government has taken major steps to curb illicit
production. But he said drug trafficking cannot be curbed until
``consumer countries'' tackle ``reduction of demand, reduction in
money laundering and in the earnings of drug trafficking.''

Gadhafi cancels visit to Egypt, no reasons given
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has canceled a
visit to Egypt that has already been postponed twice in one week,
Libyan officials said late Thursday.
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity did not give
any reason for the cancellation and gave no new date for his visit.
They spoke to reporters in the Egyptian town of Marsa Matrouh, near
the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Gadhafi was expected in Egypt on Tuesday but his trip was
postponed until Friday. But late Thursday, officials said Gadhafi
will not be arriving Friday because it coincided with the 11th
anniversary of the Arab-Israeli war.
	   Gadhafi, was expected on a 10-day visit for meetings with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, economists, university students,
academics and workers.

WHEN German battery maker Varta decided to close the doors of

<TEXT>
its manufacturing plant in Singapore last March, storekeeper
Cyrille Tan was among hundreds who took the fall.
	   It was a terrible blow for the 48-year old father of two boys
who had devoted 22 years of his life to the company only to be told
to look for a new career.
	   Luck, however, was on Tan's side. Before, he even collected his
severance payments, he managed to secure a job.
	   A nominated member of the ruling People's Action Party-dominated
Singapore parliament since October last year, Tan is now working in
the human resources department of an electronics company.
	   The story of Tan, who is also the vice-president of the
state-controlled labour movement, the National Trades Union
Congress is a rare exception considering the labour supply market
of the supposedly squeaky-clean and corrupt free island state is
not as tight as its recent past.
	   Once unemployment in a country that prides itself on its ability
to provide a job for almost every citizen was almost a non-issue.
	   Retrenchment was celebrated since workers were quite happy to be
retrenched because they got severance payments and could quite
easily get another job.
	   The labour market was so tight that foreign workers were brought
in for many jobs, especially in the construction sector, and many
families have had a foreign maid, while the unemployment rate was
almost always below two per cent.
	   But the situation has changed.
	   Those with a job to cling to have been told by the government
and the NTUC to accept wage adjustments and be prepared for the
worst.
	   Employers have started to pick and choose where they could not
before, while many of Tan's former colleagues are still supporting
their families without a job, and with more companies now forced to
retrench, and some even collapsed, because of the deepening
regional economic problem, prospects of that changing overnight are
grim.
	   Most have started to tighten their belts and hope that Tan's
luck will rub off on them, especially since they, like most
Singaporeans, are presently in debt some way. Either because of
their Housing Development Board flats that they leased for 99 years
from the government or their cars, but there is always something
they must pay every month.
	   The lack of a social safety net for those who lose a job and not
find a new one is certainly not helping either. The government does
not believe in a welfare state and firmly discourages dependence on
the government.
	   Only a few thousand people are poor enough to get a paltry
benefit of between S$300 (RM660) and S$400 per month - barely
enough to live on.
	   Worst hit are expected to be those in the above 45-year-old age
group and the minority, but indigenous Malay citizens that made up
14 per cent of the country's 3.6 million population as more
employers in their advertisements have started to specify
ethnicity, age or require Mandarin speakers - the common language
of the ethnic Chinese that forms 77 per cent of the population.
	   For the first three months of this year, a record 7,131 workers
were retrenched - 71 per cent of last year's overall figure of
9,784 and more than the previous high of 6,717 recorded for a
three-month period, which was the third quarter of the recessionary
year of 1985.
	   Unemployment in March also rose to 2.2 per cent or a total of
43,500 unemployed persons, compared with 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per
cent in December and September when the number of unemployed were
37,200 and 35,100 respectively, while the increase in the number of
jobs created slowed significantly to 17,100 from the 35,800 jobs
created in the preceding quarter.
	   The numbers are expected to increase further as one industry
after another starts to feel the impact of the worst financial
problem to sweep through Asia in three decades, while the island
state teeters on the brink of recession, although its tightly
managed economy may be in better shape than its nlave since slowed
down.
	   Companies which were planning major investments are now delaying
decisions to proceed, because demand for the products in Asia has
weakened, while some have shifted to cheaper regional locations.
	   During the first three months of the year, the country's economy
expanded by 5.6 per cent year-on-year. But, it was nothing to shout
about since the gain was partly statistical as growth during the
first quarter of last year was a marginal 4.2 per cent from a year
ago. Further, the pace was a fall from the preceding quarter's 7.6
per cent growth.
	   For the rest of the year, the government is forecasting a rosy
2.5 to 4.5 per cent growth. But with the delay in export recovery
in Asia, an underestimation of the impact of the Indonesian turmoil
on Singapore's economy, and a possible rise in interest rates from
the average seven per cent currently, most private economists are
only expecting growth at between one per cent and three per cent;
some as low as zero.
	   Until now, Singapore has experienced years of strong economic
growth - last year, despite the growing regional problems, its
economy grew 7.8 per cent from the previous year. In 1996 it grew
6.9 per cent.
	   While the impressive expansion has allowed Singaporeans to enjoy
the highest living standards in Southeast Asia, it means nothing
now to the more than 7,000 recently retrenched Singaporeans who
need a new job fast.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews expecting to find more
bodies labored to disentangle a high-speed train from the wreckage
of a bridge Thursday, while speculation about the cause of
Germany's worst post-war rail disaster extended several kilometers
(miles) down the line.
	   Deutsche Bahn took all 60 of its first-generation InterCity
Express trains out of service as they finished their runs Thursday,
idling more than half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   At least 100 people died, according to Lower Saxony state
officials, when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 crashed and
broke apart at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning
in Eschede, a small town 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said. Forty-three second-generation trains introduced since 1996
remain in service, and it was unclear how rapidly normal service
would resume.

A LITTLE too early in the week for this, right? Well, for your

<TEXT>
information, this column has been moved from its usual Friday spot
to Wednesdays from today. This is in line with other changes to the
Friday pages. Stay tuned! TORI AMOS - From The Choirgirl Hotel
(EastWest/Atlantic/54:13/LP): There may be a sense of exaggerated
drama in Tori Amos' edgy songs, and she may be doing nothing more
than expanding on the work of Kate Bush.
	   But you can't resist the icy intensity she brings to her music,
especially to the pieces on this new album. Austerely arranged with
either a dominant piano riff or a synthesizer line laid over a
techno beat, the tracks here deal with the sad, sordid lives of
troubled women.
	   Though much of the music has a mildly plangent drive, Amos is
capable of aching lyricism when you least expect it, as she proves
on things like Black-Dove (January) and Jackie's Strength.
	   It's a work that's by turns bleak and beautiful, and like most
achievements endowed with artistic merit, it's a bit demanding. But
your appreciation grows the more you listen to it.
	   (Distributed by Warner Music) Performance: 1/2 Sound: MASSIVE
ATTACK - Mezzanine (Virgin/63:38/LP): The originators of the
Bristol sound, better known as trip-hop, offer few innovations on
this third outing.
	   But the trippy texture, underscored by simulated vinyl surface
noise in the background, is often intoxicatingly atmospheric. Most
of the songs are found-sound experiments that minimise structure
and maximise space and pace.
	   These are songs of existential confusion that are appropriately
opaque, but that doesn't spoil your enjoyment. And Cocteau Twins
fans will thrill to the angelic voice of the band's former vocalist
Elizabeth Fraser on three tracks, including the single Teardrop.
Infectious space-pop for the apocalyptic age.
	   (Distributed by EMI) Performance: Sound: MONO - Formica Blues
(Echo/53:09/LP): Songwriter/producer Virgo and singer Siobhan De
Mare take the lead from bands like Portishead in combining such
diverse influences as sixties film music (Burt Bacarach and John
Barry etc.), technopop and ambient music.
	   It's a melding that works wonderfully on most of the tracks, and
De Mare's Astrud Gliberto-inspired whispery vocal style is great at
evoking mood.
	   The arrangements are quite clever and the colours from different
palettes are fluidly mixed. Strikingly eclectic pop from a
promising duo.
	   (Distributed by PonyCanyon Music) Performance: Sound: YNGWIE
JOHANN MALMSTEEN - Concerto Suite For Electric Guitar And Orchestra
In E Flat Minor Op. 1 (Canyon International/42:14/LP): No one ever
said Yngwie Malmsteen was a slouch on the guitar. But then, few
have really called him an imaginative musician. So this serious
work is a sort of a credentials-proving exercise that,
surprisingly, is a lot more listenable than his previous shredfest
outings.
	   Malmsteen composed and orchestrated the music and he's ably
accompanied by the Czech Philharmonic. While many of the motifs on
the 12 sections here are borrowed from Baroque composers, they're
tastefully assimilated.
	   Malmsteen plays with the devilish energy of a modern-day
Paganini throughout, but somehow the distorted tone of the electric
doesn't have the lyrical character of an acoustic violin. That's
the main flaw here.
	   (Distributed by PonyCanyon Music) Performance: and a half Sound:
KITARO - Gaia (Pony Canyon/49:22/LP): Kitaro's music may border the
simplistic, but at its most inspired, it can have a soothing
effect, especially when it's fully informed by the Japanese
synthesist's eco-spirituality.
	   This new album is full of airy melodies shaded by Japanese folk
music and exotic touches. The synthesizer textures are sweet, and
when the rhythms get going - echoing the speeding pulse of Kodo
drums - the pace does pick up in an exciting way.
	   But there's little in the way of a fresh approach here.
	   (Distributed by Pony-Canyon Music) Performance: 1/2 Sound: DAVID
GATES - Take Me Now (PonyCanyon Music/33:17/LP): Comfortably
settled with his family on a ranch bought with ever-increasing
royalties from Bread songs, David Gates now seems to make music out
of boredom. That shows in the songs, especially the trite pieces on
this new recording.
	   The love ballads are so lacking in soul and spirit that you'll
wish he would try something more worthwhile - like redoing his old
hits. The album doesn't compare to his last solo effort, Love Is
Always Seventeen.
	   (Distributed by PonyCanyon Music) Performance: Sound: SIMPLY
SMOOTH -Nothing But Smooth (Adam Records/45:15/LP): A vocal trio
that churns out the kind of easy-listening soul-pop flooding the
airwaves nowadays. It's all competently performed, but you'll yearn
for something more original and adventurous by the time you get to
the middle of the album.
	   (Distributed by PonyCanyon Music) Performance: Sound: SAND 
GOLD -Remember My Name (Kick Music/49:34/LP): A Scandinavian
country-pop duo trying to make it on the strength of a bunch of
songs that are pretty but riddled with platitudes that'll make you
cringe. The phrasing of the English lyrics is not always spot-on -
but at least the singing is palatable.

Petron Corp. has raised the prices of three deregulated oil

<TEXT>
products by an average P0.383 a liter.
	   The country's biggest oil firm, which is 40% owned by Saudi
Aramco, jacked up the prices of premium gasoline by P0.42 to P12.03
a liter, unleaded gasoline by P0.42 to P11.69 and diesel by P0.31
to P8.36.
	   Petron officials earlier said oil firms planned to adjust prices
because of the higher landed cost of crude and the weak peso.
	   The price of Dubai crude went up $0.49 to $12.69 a barrel in May
from the previous month's level.
	   The peso slid to 39.32 last month from 36.43 in April.
	   Two other oil refiners - Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp. and
Caltex (Philippines) Inc. - are expected to adjust prices once
Petron raises its prices.
	   Shell is a member of the Royal Dutch/Shell group of companies
while Caltex is the local arm of the joint venture between Texaco
Inc. and Chevron Corp.
	   Petron's price adjustment came following an announcement from
the Energy Regulatory Board that it would raise the prices of three
socially-sensitive oil products by an average P0.24 a liter on or
before June 3.
	   Under a recently passed oil deregulation law, oil firms can
freely adjust prices of petroleum products except for regular
gasoline, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gasoline, which are
still under government control. -

BERJAYA Singer Bhd will seek to strike out a winding-up petition

<TEXT>
filed against subsidiary, Singer (M) Sdn Bhd, resulting from a
claim of RM49,270.80 filed against the company by a former employee
at the subsidiary.
	   In a statement, BSinger said its subsidiary had sacked former
shop manager Tan Cheng Teik and sued him for RM152,195.00 for
shortages of stock. Tan had counter-claimed for RM49,270.80 as
monies due to him.
	   Singer's suit against Tan was struck off due to an oversight on
the part of its solicitors and Tan entered judgment-in-default in
his counterclaim against Singer on April 23, last year.
	   The winding-up petition presented is grounded upon Singer's
non-payment of the sum of RM56,996.70 involving judgment sum and
costs pursuant to the judgment-in-default entered by Tan.
	   The group said it will take immediate steps to set aside the
default judgment and to stay the winding-up petition, and assured
that Singer is solvent and still registering profits.
	   In a separate statement, Ho Wah Genting Bhd said its subsidiary
Ho Wah Genting Capital Sdn Bhd has made arrangements to pay RM4.54
million to PB Securities Sdn Bhd through monthly instalments of
RM30,000. The first payment was made on May 15.
	   Previously, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange through its member's
circular stated that Ho Wah Genting Capital Sdn Bhd is a defaulter
of RM5.45 million.
	   ``The amount due to PB Securities arises from a Broker Tie-Up
Arrangement entered between both companies, which enabled Ho Wah
Genting Capital's clients to trade securities through PB
Securities.''

PRINTING company Tien Wah Press Holdings Bhd has tied up with a

<TEXT>
United Kingdom firm to produce cigarette filter covers.
	   The 51:49 joint venture with Interbobbin (UK) Ltd is to
manufacture perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper at a plant
located in Puchong, Selangor.
	   Managing director H.B. Lim yesterday said the joint venture
company -Interbobbin (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd - was the only one in the
country to manufacture the product.
	   Speaking at Tien Wah's third annual general meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Lim said Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) Bhd had approved
of Interbobbin's perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper.
	   ``It is important for cigarette manufacturers to approve the
product. If we want to sell to them, we have to meet their
specifications,'' he said.
	   He said Interbobbin UK would transfer the technology to enable
Interbobbin Malaysia to manufacture the product here.
	   Apart from perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper, the company
also makes non-perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper.
	   ``The perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper is mainly used for
`light' cigarettes. It has tiny holes which enable a smoker to
inhale more oxygen and reduce the intake of tar,'' Lim said.
	   Since the perforated cork-tipping paper is now also used for
``normal''
	   cigarettes, it is difficult to value the market for it in the
country, he added.
	   Lim expects Interbobbin Malaysia to register at least RM5
million in profits for the current year ending Dec 31, 1998.
	   ``We expect the perforated cigarette cork-tipping paper to
contribute at least 50 per cent to Interbobbin Malaysia's profit,''
he said.
	   On the group's future performance, Lim said: ``We will strive to
register a profit for the current year ending Dec 31, 1998. It will
be a trying period for Tien Wah as well as other publishing
companies as paper materials are imported.''
	   He added Tien Wah sourced paper and paper board from Finland and
Austria and paid in US dollars. The cost of the materials has
increased in tandem with the depreciation of the ringgit.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, Tien Wah's group pre-tax profit
declined 23.7 per cent to RM5.47 million from RM7.17 million in the
previous corresponding year.
	   The group's turnover fell 18 per cent to RM88.19 million from
RM107.58 million in 1996.
	   Earnings per share dropped to 13.3 sen from 17.1 sen in 1996. A
net dividend of six per cent per share has been recommended.

YAMAHA Electronics Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd, maker of

<TEXT>
audio-visual equipment for Yamaha Corporation of Japan, intends to
increase production by some 15 per cent to 1.4 million units
annually next year.
	   The Ipoh-based plant currently produces 1.2 million sets per
year.
	   Managing director Masaro Ida told reporters yesterday that the
company was also taking advantage of the depreciated ringgit to
expand its worldwide market share.
	   ``We trade in US dollars and as such products manufactured and
shipped out from Malaysia become cheaper,'' he explained.
	   Yamaha is currently among the leading audio-visual brands in the
United States as well as some parts of Europe.
	   The company's Malaysian manufacturing facility, one of only two
audio-visual manufacturing facilities outside Japan, produces 70
per cent of Yamaha's audio-visual products for the worldwide
market.
	   ``This facility is our biggest audio-visual manufacturing
establishment with 99 per cent of the production exported to the
United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world,'' Ida
said.
	   Local consumption of Yamaha products is minimal and current
market conditions have made sales unfavourable. However, the global
market was still attractive, according to Ida.
	   He said the depreciation of the ringgit, while increasing the
cost of certain imported components, made the products more
competitive in the global market.
	   However, he conceded that Yamaha had to be constantly on its
toes and work harder and more productively to remain competitive in
terms of pricing and quality.
	   According to Ida, Yamaha viewed Sony as its main competitor in
the audio-visual equipment trade.
	   Set up in Malaysia some seven years ago, Yamaha Electronics
Manufacturing is wholly-owned by Yamaha Corporation. To date 4.7
billion yen has been invested in the Malaysian plant which sits on
6.4-hectare site at the Kinta Free Industrial Zone.
	   The company yesterday officially opened its third building
within its compound, offering more space for its research and
development department and making way for Yamaha's new After
Service Parts Depot which has been transferred from Japan to
Malaysia.
	   The new depot, to be fully functional in October, will be
Yamaha's worldwide centre for its audio-visual equipment spare
parts.
	   Meanwhile, the research and development department, which within
one year of its setting up has produced two new models, is now
working on yet another new product - a five-channel audio-visual
receiver for home theatre systems.
	   Yesterday's ceremony meanwhile also marked the production of the
plant's five millionth unit.
	   Ida said having obtained the ISO 9002 certification in 1994, the
company was now working towards both the ISO 9001 and the ISO 14001
certifications which it hoped to achieve by the end of the year.
	   Meanwhile, Yamaha Electronics Manufacturing has teamed up with
Polyteknik Ungku Omar in Ipoh on a training programme under which
Yamaha staff will undergo a year's training with the latter.
	   This, said Ida, was to ensure the company's staff, which now
stood at 1,200, were constantly trained and had the opportunity to
move upwards and improve themselves.

The National Power Corp. (Napocor) yesterday said it was eyeing

<TEXT>
a total 27 electric cooperatives and industries nationwide as
potential customers for its proposed one-day power sales contract.
	   Of the 18 possible clients located in Luzon, six have already
made a firm commitment to participate in the said scheme.
	   Alberto C. Guanzon, manager of Napocor's operation planning and
protection department, identified the interested firms as Tarlac I
Electric Cooperative Inc.; Isabela I Electric Cooperative Inc.;
Philex Mining Corp.
	   in Benguet; Hi-Cement Corp. in Bulacan; the Baguio City Export
Processing Zone Authority; and Benguet Electric Cooperative Inc.
	   The one-day power sales scheme involves a contract for the
supply of power by Napocor to customers with self-generation,
taking into account specific hours or time blocks of a day, on a
day to day basis, at very competitive prices.
	   The scheme also involve the creation of a spot market wherein
daily trading of napocor's unutilized capacity will be conducted.
	   Guanzon, who is also project manager of the one-day power sales
scheme, said Napocor had formed a rollout team to personally visit
all potential customers and to determine whether their
self-generating units have the necessary generation capacity -- at
least one megawatt (MW) -- as well as the technical equipment to
take part of the daily bidding.
	   Under the procedure for the one-day power sales contract,
pre-qualified cooperatives and firms will be required to submit
their bids electronically two days before the actual bidding date.
These bids should specify the quantity of electricity, the duration
and location, and the corresponding price.
	   Apart from the six companies that have already signified their
intention to bid for Napocor's unutilized capacity, other potential
customers in Luzon include the Clark Development Corp., the Bataan
Export Processing Zone in Mariveles, and Petron Corp.'s oil
refinery in Limay.
	   Also in Napocor's list are Angeles Electric Corp., Cabanatuan
Electric Corp., Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative, Zambales II
Electric Cooperative Inc., as well as industrial customers Solid
Development Corp. and United Pulp and Paper Co. both in Bulacan.
	   In Visayas, potential clients include General Milling Corp. in
Mactan, Grand Cement Manufacturing Corp., Philippine Phosphate
Fertilizers Inc., and the Mactan Export Processing Zone Authority.
	   Interested utilities include Visayan Electric Co. Inc., Panay
Electric Co., Central Negros Electric Cooperative Inc., and Bohol I
Electric Cooperative Inc.
	   Two potential customers have been identified in Mindanao,
namely: Cagayan Electric Power and Light Co. and Philippine Sinter
Corp. in Misamis Oriental.
	   Guanzon said the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), Napocor's
biggest customer, may be allowed to participate in the bidding once
the state firm amends its petition for the one-day power sales
scheme.
	   The said petition, which is now pending before the Energy
Regulatory Board (ERB), does not cover Meralco, as the Lopez-owned
firm had earlier insisted on bidding on behalf of the 51 industries
and self-generators operating within its franchise area.
	   ``Napocor is still trying to thresh out the finer details of the
mechanism, which will redound to the benefit of both Meralco and
the industries located within its franchise,'' Guanzon said.
	   Napocor is eyeing revenues of about P1.1 billion from the
implementation of the one-day power sales contract, including about
P200 million this year alone.
	   By the power firm's estimates, it can bid out close to 500 MW
under the said scheme, which include roughly 350 MW in Luzon alone.

U.S. objects to Caspian oil transported through Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The United States would oppose any plan
to transport Caspian Sea oil to market through Iran, a U.S.
official said Thursday.
	   Washington considers Iran unreliable because it sponsors
terrorism and aspires to become a nuclear power, said Stephen
Sestanovic, an adviser to the U.S. secretary of state on the former
Soviet republics.
	   Sestanovic spoke to reporters after talks with Azerbaijani
President Geidar Aliev in Baku.
	   Iran says that sending oil from the Caspian Sea's vast fields
through Iran would be cheaper and more direct than a U.S.-backed
proposal to send the fuel through Turkey.
	   Sestanovic later flew to Ashgabat, capital of the Central Asian
capital of Turkmenistan where he held talks with government
officials, the Interfax news agency said.

Rain cancels opening round of dlrs 600,000 tournament
</HEADLINE>
  By ED SCHAFER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Rain washed out the first round of the U.S.
LPGA's Michelob Light Classic on Thursday.
	   A steady rain left water standing on parts of the Forest Hills
Country Club course. Organizers had hoped to get in at least a
partial round, but by noon it was obvious that that would not
happen.
	   The tournament was reduced to 54 holes, with the cut coming
Saturday, after 36 holes have been played.
	   The move had to be a disappointment for defending champion
Annika Sorenstam, who wants to get the tournament started for a
number of reasons.
	   She likes the people, she likes the golf course, but mostly, she
needs a win. And she's won the St. Louis event twice before.
	   Droughts are uncommon for Sorenstam, 28, particularly recently.
Six of her 12 career championship games were in 1997, when she was
the LPGA's leading money winner with earnings of dlrs 1.2 million.
	   This year has been harder. Sorenstam has no victories and
earnings of dlrs 288,400 to date, still good enough for fourth on
the tour.
	   It has to be frustrating, even for the laid-back Swede, right?
	   ``Not at all,'' said Sorenstam, who came to St. Louis recently
to prepare for the tournament at Forest Hills Country Club. ``I've
played pretty well, I think.''
	   The competition is getting more intense, Sorenstam said, with
younger players making their presence felt.
	   ``My scoring average is going down and I'm still not winning,''
she said. ``I think there will be a lot of new winners this year.''
	   Two young women who will be trying to join that category are
this year's sponsor's exemptions, U.S. collegiate Player of the
Year Marisa Baena and Cindy Mueller, a golf instructor who made the
cut here last year.
	   Among the 144 players in this year's field trying to keep the
youngsters down, however, are seven of the top 10 money winners on
the tour, including Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, Donna Andrews, Pat
Hurst, Lorie Kane, Danielle Ammaccapane and Meg Mallon.
	   But Sorenstam has a comfort factor at Forest Hills that none of
the other players can match. She has won two of the three times she
has played here, in 1995 and last year. She said just being here
gives her a boost.
	   ``I know I can play this course,'' she said. ``It gives me a lot
of confidence. I know every hole. I can play it in my sleep.''
	   The 6,350-yard (5804-meter), par 72 layout fits her game,
Sorenstam believes. The fairways are tight, often lined with large
trees. She is annually among the LPGA leaders in hitting fairways
and greens.
	   ``It's a course where you have to think a lot,'' she said. ``A
lot of players run out of patience. I have a lot (of patience) and
I think that's why I play so well here.''

SEVERAL applications for Kulim High Technology Park projects

<TEXT>
worth between RM2 billion and RM3 billion are being assessed.
	   Kulim Technology Park Corporation Sdn Bhd managing director
Ahmad Shukri Tajuddin yesterday said these applications could be
finalised in two to three years - three to four months at the
soonest.
	   Most of the interested companies are from the United States.
	   Ahmad Shukri said the park to date has attracted 27 companies
with total investments of over RM15 billion.
	   Among these companies, five are from Japan. Two of the five
Japanese investors have already began operations while the rest are
still constructing their facilities.
	   Ahmad Shukri said this in Kuala Lumpur after signing a teaming
agreement with 3Com Asia Ltd (Malaysia) and Stacks Technology Sdn
Bhd to provide networking solutions for the Kulim High Technology
Park.
	   He signed on behalf of Kulim Technology Management Sdn Bhd
(KTM), which is an 80 per cent subsidiary of KTPC. The remaining 20
per cent in KTM is owned by Universiti Sains Malaysia.
	   Ahmad Shukri reiterated that investors who have leased
industrial lots at the park had not backed out or deferred
construction despite the economic slowdown.
	   Touted as ``The Science City of the Future'', the RM1.2 billion
Kulim High Technology Park has been carefully designed to
incorporate various functions - industrial, research and
development facilities and a new township concept with full
amenities including medical and educational institutions.

The club scene has lately been getting a boost from local

<TEXT>
deejays promoting new genres in music like club, rave, house,
garage, techno, and electronica (a hit in the US). And with major
sponsors like the American cigarette Lucky Strike, the regular club
phenomenon is further brought into fore.
	   Recently, Lucky Strike launched its ``Strike the Edge'' club
tour by bringing in deejay Hippie Torrales, a disciple of garage
music who performed at Planet Mars last May 30.
	   Deejays are considered ``underground'' celebrities in the US and
Europe. They mix and remix records and create continuous sound from
one song to another with seamlessness (if the deejay is good). Ten
years ago, they were not considered music artists; now they are.
	   Deejays like Hippie Torrales have much to say about their
``art''. Hippie (short for Hipolito) -- with his unusual goatee and
impish grin --was enamored by it when he was just 14. Entering a
club in New Jersey, he was intrigued by the continuous, non-stop
music playing in the background. He recounts, ``It was completely
different from the music at home that stopped as the set dropped a
new record and the needle came back on. I went up to the deejay
that night and asked him -- what was going on? how do you do that?
And he took me aside and showed me the turntables and the mixer and
how he blended two records together.''
	   By the time he was 15, Hippie was hooked, deejaying with a
partner at parties until he was 20 and becoming one of the pioneers
at the legendary Zanzibar club. In 1980, he was named ``Deejay of
the Year'' by Billboard magazine, an honor he shared with Larry
Levan, who is considered a club divinity. In 1989, he got into
studio work, releasing ``You're Going to Miss Me,'' which made a
big noise in the charts. Now, he is doing both original works and
re-mixes -- two loves of his life.
	   ``Deejaying gives you that instant gratification. When you're
playing a big room, with a sea of 2,000 people dancing, it's an
adrenalin rush. And when you're doing an intimate setting, with a
few hundred people, you can really feel the people. With studio
work, you're an artist, you're creating,'' he describes.
	   Hippie currently does gigs in England, Italy, Spain, and Japan.
His recent visit here launched the ``Strike the Edge'' club tour,
where deejays from the US and Europe will be flown in to do the
club rounds.
	   For Hippie, being a deejay is like breathing: ``If you are a
deejay, you are a deejay for life. It is a lifestyle.'' Deejaying
is both an artform and a lifestyle, he emphasizes. In another
interview, he likened it to good sex: ``There's a build-up, and
then a climax, then you break it down, then build and start all
over again. It shouldn't be 'slam, bang, thank you, ma'm.'''
	   Hippie listens to ``everything that is good -- jungle, garage,
techno, etc.''
	   And he cannot tell you the ultimate experience: ``Every
experience is different. I cannot say which is the ultimate.''
	   He adds, ``I feel creative with the vinyl than with the CD. It
is like the difference between the piano and the synthesizer piano.
I love to feel vinyl, manipulate it. I can't do that with the CD,
with the machine.''
	   About the popularity of deejays and dance music, he says:
``Deejays have replaced the bands. The popularity of dance music is
because of the popularity of the deejays.''
	   After Hippie Torrales, ``Strike the Edge'' will go to Limits
with Tedd Patterson (with locals Toti Dalmacion, Cocoy Puyat, and
Robert Villaluz) on June 6. It will be at Euphoria featuring Jazzy
M (with Manolet Dario and Mon Maramba) on June 13. And on July 11,
it will be at Star City with superstar deejay CJ Macintosh. -- Roel

PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia and

<TEXT>
East Asian countries need a revival of Japanese investments to
revitalise their troubled economies.
	   Japan, he said, had the means to resuscitate East Asia, ``if
only it thinks less about what others say if Japan frustrates
them.''
	   ``What Malaysia and the rest of the region need, is a revival of
Japanese investments to create jobs, to enrich the people,
stimulate economic growth and create good markets for Japan.''
	   ``Some of the money the Japanese Government is pumping into your
economy could very well be pumped into the troubled economies of
East Asia. As before when Japanese investments created prosperity
for East Asia and in turn provided good markets for Japan's
products; Japanese money to revive East Asian economies would
benefit these countries and Japan.''
	   He was speaking at the Symposium on ``Revitalisation of the
Japanese Economy and the Future of Asia'' hosted by the Institute
for International Monetary Affairs yesterday.
	   Dr Mahathir, speaking before an audience of international
government and corporate leaders, described Japan as ``the richest
depressed country in the world'' but still possessing the capacity
to grow and be the locomotive of growth for the region.
	   But he said Japan needed ``to clean up the bad practices of the
past which it had largely done so.''
	   Dr Mahathir said Japan had everything needed to rebuild its own
economy including the capital, the technology and the skills to
help in making East Asia a market for itself and the world.
Malaysia, he added, was still looking East though Japan had
obviously failed in several areas.
	   ``But even failures provide lessons for us. There are still many
things we can learn from you - your exceptional skills, your
technology, your discipline and work ethics are still worth
copying.''
	   Dr Mahathir, while stressing on the need for Japan to revitalise
its economy for its own benefit as well as that of the rest of East
Asia, reiterated the urgency to deal with ``the entire issue of
reform of the international financial system,'' which if there was
a system at all, was ``messy, unreliable and destructive.''
	   He said a reform would ensure currency stability and contain the
activities of those who buy and sell money for no other purpose
than to make profits.
	   Consistent and unrelenting in his view that currency traders
were chiefly to blame for the financial instability in the region,
the Prime Minister said ``the excuse that currency trading provides
market forces with the means to discipline governments'' was
totally unacceptable.
	   ``There is nothing to indicate the need for currency trading
other than the vast profits that can be made by currency traders.''
	   ``On the other hand, we now know the extent of the damage to the
economies of whole countries and regions that currency trading can
inflict.''
	   The Prime Minister said it would be a ``sad commentary'' on the
ability of the world's financial and economic geniuses if they
could not come up with proposals on a new financial system.
	   ``Their habit of merely trying to explain the present turmoil as
being due to bad practices by the Governments concerned, sounds too
much like an apology and a defence of currency traders.''
	   ``Money does not know whether a Government is good or bad to
react by adjusting their rates of exchange. Somebody is doing that
and is evidently making a lot of profit. Do we need to protect
these people's interest at the expense of world trade?''
	   Dr Mahathir, in offering his suggestions for the revitalisation
of the economies in this region, said he ``was no expert in this
area but I have had some success in my country.''
	   ``I think I know what I am talking about more than the theorists
who have never run any country, much less help it grow.''
	   ``Left to themselves the economies of East Asia will grow again.
But chances are they will never be left to themselves. Thus,
revitalisation will not be easy,'' he added.

President-elect Joseph Estrada's 10-point land reform program -

<TEXT>
dubbed ``Land for the Poor'' - will take four years to implement,
and will only work if government backs it up with political will
and money.
	   In a news conference yesterday, outgoing Agrarian Reform
Secretary Ernesto Garilao said government had yet to distribute
lands in the Bicol region, western Visayas and central Mindanao.
	   In terms of productivity, he said, the Estrada administration
should focus on developing 4.6 million hectares of farm lands that
the Ramos administration distributed under the comprehensive
agrarian reform law.
	   ``These lands are in the hands of small farmers, who must now
have access to support services such as irrigation, farm-to-market
roads, post-harvest facilities, credit and many more,'' said
Garilao.
	   A University of the Philippines study showed productivity was
highest among agrarian reform beneficiaries who grew corn and
coconut.
	   Garilao stressed Estrada's agrarian reform program would only be
realized ``if there is political will and money.''
	   He lauded the appointment of leftist leader Horacio Morales as
the next agrarian reform secretary.
	   ``The designation of Morales is a strong and unequivocal signal
from the Estrada government that agrarian reform will remain a
priority program in poverty reduction,'' said Garilao.
	   Morales is a former spokesman of the National Democratic Front,
political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Copyright

A SYSTEM is needed to check the excessive fluctuations of

<TEXT>
currencies in the world's financial markets but it should not be
one that imposes restrictions on currencies in which trade can take
place, International Monetary Fund deputy managing director Stanley
Fischer said yesterday.
	   ``It is clear that we can hope to have a better system and
should work towards one but it should not be one that seeks to go
back to pre-World War arrangements of bilateral balance of trade
and other ideas,'' he said on a point made by Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad in his keynote address at the symposium on
The Revitalisation of the Japanese Economy and the Future of Asia.
	   Dr Mahathir in his speech, described by participants as
``forceful, clear and encouraging'', had suggested a reform in the
international financial system which he said was ``messy,
unreliable and destructive''.
	   Dr Mahathir said interference of currency traders had caused
currency instability and that the only way Malaysia could overcome
this instability (in the exchange rate) and to rebuild the economy
was to revert to bartering.
	   On globalisation which Dr Mahathir said would really benefit the
rich, Fischer said the East Asian region had, more than any other,
benefited from the opening of the world economy over the last 10
years.
	   ``It is true that the gains and income of these countries, in
particular China, were historically unprecedented and were a
remarkable achievement.
	   ``Without opening of the world markets after the second World
War, it would not have happened. We should under no circumstances
ignore that fact or imagine that there would be a solution which
will benefit countries in this region or countries anywhere that
seeks to withdraw from a globalised system.''
	   He made these remarks before starting on his address at the
symposium.
	   In his speech, Fischer said the Asian economic problem had been
all the more shocking for having struck countries with a sustained
record of outstanding economic performance.
	   Nonetheless, he said, at the beginning of their IMF-supported
programmes, Thailand, Korea and Indonesia faced a number of similar
problems, including market confidence, deep currency depreciation,
weak financial system and excessive unhedged foreign borrowing by
the domestic private sector.
	   He defended criticism on ``IMF austerity medicine'' being
inappropriately dispensed to countries sufferring from a different
disease and the damage measures to restructure the financial system
and improve corporate governance.
	   He said when South Korea and Thailand approached the IMF, their
reserves were ``periliously low'' and the Indonesian rupiah was
excessively depreciated. ``Thus the first order of business was to
restore confidence in the currency.''
	   He said to achieve this, countries had to make it more
attractive to hold domestic currency, which in turn required
increasing interest rates temporarily even if higher interest costs
complicated the situation of weak banks and corporations.
	   He said once confidence was restored, interest rates could
return to more normal levels which was now happening in South Korea
and Thailand.

SAMSUNG Electronics Group, the largest South Korean investor in

<TEXT>
Malaysia, has doubled its total sales in the first quarter of the
year to RM990 million compared to RM495 million for the same
quarter last year.
	   This was achieved despite the financial problem in the region.
	   Compared to the previous quarter ended Dec 31, 1997, the group's
turnover registered an impressive increase of 18.14 per cent.
	   Samsung Electronics Group president Kim Jong Ki said the group's
manufacturing operations had exceeded its sales target for the
first quarter by 20 per cent.
	   The operations are undertaken by Samsung Electron Devices (M)
Sdn Bhd, Samsung Corning (M) Sdn Bhd, Samsung Electronics Display
(M) Sdn Bhd and Samsung Electronics (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   Samsung Electron Devices, Samsung Corning, and Samsung
Electronics Display operate from integrated manufacturing
facilities in Tuanku Jaafar Industrial Park in Senawang, Seremban.
	   The three companies produce colour picture tubes, glass panels
and funnels for televisions and monitors as well as the
award-winning Samsung SyncMaster colour monitors.
	   Samsung Electronics, which operates from its factory in Port
Klang, manufactures microwave ovens.
	   Almost all of Samsung's products are exported. Its microwave
ovens, computer monitors and colour picture tubes enjoy good demand
in the US and Europe.
	   ``We faced tough competition in pricing because of the regional
depreciation of currencies but we believe our efforts in increasing
productivity and stepping up cost saving programmes have paid
off.''
	   Kim said Samsung had also been aggressive in seeking new export
markets.
	   He added that the group was confident of Malaysia's recovery as
the country is committed to attracting foreign investors and has
the infrastructure as well as political stability that remain
conducive for investments.
	   The current economic slowdown would not affect the group's
investments and it will strive for continued improvements in
quality and productivity.
	   ``Samsung is confident of maintaining its good performance for
the second quarter (of the year) because the (four) companies have
received good response from customers and are expanding
aggressively into the Middle East and CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) countries.''

MALACCA, Tues. - A district council supervisor, charged with

<TEXT>
giving false evidence during a corruption trial, was never
pressured into giving statements to Anti-Corruption Agency
officers, the Sessions Court heard today.
	   Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Bache said the statements made by
Md Yusop to the officers in relation to the case of former State
Executive Councillor Datuk Sahar Arpan were made voluntarily.
	   ``There was no pressure whatsoever. The officers had testified
that Md Yusop was never handcuffed when they took his statements.
Md Yusop was also given the choice of place he wanted the recording
to take place. He volunteered to give his statements,'' he said in
his submission.
	   Ahmad contended that Md Yusop, the former managing director of
Ivory Heights Sdn Bhd, was also given the opportunity to amend his
statements on several occasions before Sahar's trial began at the
High Court.
	   However, he did not want to do so. ``After his statements were
recorded, the officers read them to him and asked whether he wanted
to make any amendments.
	   ``They even came to his house in case he changed his mind but Md
Yusop said he did not want to amend them,'' Ahmad said.
	   Md Yusop is charged with giving false evidence during the trial
of Sahar, who is facing three charges of corruption relating to
applications for land which he allegedly approved between 1994 and
1995.
	   He is charged with giving seven points of evidence which
contradicted statements he made to the ACA. Md Yusop allegedly
committed the offence before High Court Judge Datuk Suriyadi Halim
Omar between 9.30am and 1pm on Nov 12 last year.
	   Suriyadi impeached Md Yusop's credibility on Nov 13 last year,
following applications by the prosecution which found material
contradictions between his evidence in court and statements made to
the ACA.
	   Ahmad said the accused had failed to raise any doubt on the
charges.
	   ``He testified that he could not understand the questions by ACA
officers regarding documents which he signed. Although he stopped
schooling after Standard Six, Md Yusop holds a top Umno post in his
area and is active in many associations.
	   Ahmad also submitted that defence counsel, Jagjit Singh, had
failed to reconcile contradictions in Md Yusop's statements.
	   Jagjit, in his submission, contended that the prosecution had
failed to prove a prima facie case against the accused. He said Md
Yusop's statements to the ACA had not been certified.
	   ``The statements did not have any certificate nor did it bear
the seal of the High Court Registry office.'' As such, the exhibit,
therefore, was inadmissible.
	   On Md Yusop's statements recorded by ACA officers on Oct 3, 17
and 19, 1996, Jagjit said the accused was never asked whether what
he said in the statements were true.
	   The original handwritten statements were also never shown to
him.
	   Jagjit added that Md Yusop had given a reasonable explanation to
the apparent contradictory statements and that the contradictions
were not substantial.
	   He submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge
and voluntariness of the statements to the ACA.
	   ``The accused, during cross-examination by the prosecution, had
stated that he had been threatened. The prosecution has failed to
prove that the statements were made voluntarily.''
	   Judge Rajendran Nayagam fixed June 20 for judgment.

KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - A former manager told the Sessions Court

<TEXT>
today that he credited a total of RM56,000 into the bank account of
a businessman as payment for visas allegedly obtained from the
Saudi Arabian embassy in Jakarta for Malaysian pilgrims to perform
the haj in Mecca in 1993.
	   Mohd Bahrin Mohd Nor, 30, now a businessman, said the money was
banked into Wan Hassan Noor's Malayan Banking Berhad account in
three payments.
	   He said the payments were for the visas of 94 pilgrims handled
by his former company Syarikat Pakatan Jaya and also for a group of
pilgrims handled by his friend.
	   He was giving evidence at the trial of Wan Hassan, who is
charged with two counts of cheating. Religious teacher Roroh Saleh
   Abdullah Saleh is charged with abetting him and forging visa
stamps and signatures on 94 passports.
	   Wan Hassan is alleged to have deceived Mohd Bahrin through Syed
Ahmad Syed Husin, a pilgrimage organiser, into believing he (Wan
Hassan) was in a position to obtain 94 visas from the Saudi Arabian
embassy in Indonesia.
	   The offence was allegedly committed between April 10 and May 3,
1993, at the Merdeka Hotel, 44 Jalan Hj Hussein.
	   Hearing was postponed to Aug 6.

``ONE more! Give us one more squat, jelly buns!'' huffed my
brawny gym buddy. Obviously, Muscle wasn't exactly the most
diplomatic of words, but the agony in my butt (excuse me, my
``gluteus maximus'') brutally nipped any acerbic retort in the bud.
So when Muscle relieved my shocked shoulders of the 45kg

<TEXT>
barbell, I crumpled to the ground in a heap, finally realising what
that most unfortunate egg, Humpty Dumpty, felt like when he fell
off the wall.
	   Like him, I was certain that my convulsing corpse was beyond
repair.
	   ``It's either `jelly belly' or `honey buns', you muscleheaded
masochist,''
	   I miraculously managed through the thick, crushing manacles of
anguish.
	   ``Duh! Like I'm not the totally braindead entity you think I am.
I said `jelly buns' 'coz I mean `JELLY BUNS'. We haven't come to
your abdominals yet, so I wouldn't know what shape they're in.
	   ``Besides, from what I've seen, there's nothing particularly
sweet or honey-like about your bu...,'' trailed Muscle before
snapping shut its gob.
	   My snarling face promised bloody murder.
	   Muscle, whom I first thought of as a brainless pillar of
strength, was turning out to be rather eloquent and witty. Perhaps
it was because, in the gym, Muscle was in its element. The bum!
Argh, my bum! After my last assignment, during which I had an
enlightening if frightful brush with the strong arms of Truth, I
was determined to beef up on strength so that I could muscle my way
out of tight spots when necessary.
	   A relative suggested that I join a gym and hire a personal
trainer. But not wanting to take chances (what if, during my ever
so dangerous job as word reporter, I found myself outnumbered by
hostile words?), I went one step further and secured myself a
personal trainer and a bodyguard all rolled into one. Like, you
know, a two-for-the-price-of-one deal.
	   With a little investigation, I was finally introduced to Muscle
who, fortuitously, was also looking for a client-employer.
	   Strangely enough, during our initial meeting, Muscle - although
awesomely sinewy - struck me as rather meek, even mousy. It said
little and seemed to twitch the way a mouse would.
	   That's why I thought that Muscle, though physically impressive,
wasn't exactly what you'd call a ``mental heavyweight''. How
typical! To me that didn't matter as long as the twitching titan
could floor any bad, psychologically-scarring words that came my
way.
	   But here, in the gym as a personal trainer, the seemingly gentle
giant was proving to be a regular tyrant.
	   Towering over a prostrated me, the wretched power-tripper
gleefully declared: ``For the first week, we'll work all the major
muscle groups in your body ...''
	   It was therefore deep into that most ungentle night by the time
my gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, quadriceps,
lower abdominals, upper abdominals, latissimus dorsi, pectorals,
triceps, biceps, deltoids and trapezius (but to name only the
nameable parts of my anatomy) were so-called ``maxed out''.
	   Muscle and I were the last entities respectively to scurry and
tumble out of the gym into the night. I hung onto the tree-trunk
that was Muscle's left arm the way a drowning person might to a
match stick.
	   Under different circumstances, my proximity to Muscle would have
otherwise looked romantic; what with me dangling, in a swoon of
sorts, off its arm of steel.
	   For now, every nerve and fibre in me ached in an odd, euphoric
manner as we headed towards the car. Out of habit, though, I felt
the urge to grumble about my situation.
	   However, the muscles in my jaw just refused to do my bidding and
so my mouth remained serenely shut. But not for long.
	   Just as I was fumbling for my car keys, I was grabbed from the
back and a shrill shriek, with a life of its own, tore through my
throat.
	   ``Muscle! Help!'' I yelped, only to see, under the week rays of
the street lamp, Muscle scampering back towards the gym; my
captor's diabolic laughter hot on the heels of Muscle's squeaky
footfalls.
	   To cut a long and nasty story short, I was mugged for all that I
was worth, and the irony of it all was that my exercise had left me
feeling so weak, I didn't even attempt to put up a fight. All I
wanted to do was, literally, get the scumbag mugger off my back.
	   ``Take my bag. Every-thing you could possibly want from me is in
there,''
	   I said, hoping it to be true. And so it was.
	   But the greatest irony of all - talking about arms of steel,
that is - was this whole business of my bolting bodyguard.
	   In tandem, the weight training session and mugging left me
feeling curiously disembodied. I guess you could say that I was
having an out-of-body experience.
	   I sort of glided, as op-posed to walked, in quest of meek
Muscle. The gym was locked, but, as anticipated, I found Muscle
cowering in the shadow of its left wall.
	   Muscle started when I bent down to touch its buffed if cold
shoulder.
	   Shamefaced and teary eyed, the hunk of a word squeaked an
apology. What still amazes me, is how calm I was about it all.
	   ``All right Muscle, what's your story?
	   ``There must be a good reason for this atypical cowardice,'' I
said, sliding down the wall in a heap of splendid exhaustion next
to it.
	   ``What do mean `atypical cowardice'?'' Muscle asked.
	   ``Well, you are `Muscle', right? You're supposed to be strong
and courageous and like Macho and like totally in control.''
	   ``Duh! Like who's the musclehead now? If only you really knew,''
Muscle said, its voice rising.
	   ``Knew what?'' I asked.
	   ``That my original Latin form, `musculus' means `a little
mouse','' Muscle almost whispered.
	   All I could do was stretch my tired eyes in wonder.
	   After giving me a defeated smile, Muscle continued: ``It seems
the Romans had a great sense of humour, at my expense, that is.
They thought that the movement of a muscle reminded them of a
mouse.
	   ``Like you know, the Romans were great lovers of beauty and
physical perfection,'' Muscle paused, sucking in air.
	   `` ... and some Roman poet must have seen the smooth ripple of
some Roman athlete's muscles and so likened muscles to little mice
appearing and disappearing in their play. What abuses some get away
with in the unholy name of poetic justice!''
	   I grunted in sympathy.
	   ``I guess everyone kind of liked that fated Roman Poet's simile
because many of the other languages - those that branched off from
Latin and even those that did not - retained some form of
`musculus','' Muscle said peering through the darkness at nothing
in particular.
	   ``Then why didn't you say something sooner? Why did you agree to
be my bodyguard when in essence you're nothing more than a mouse?''
I said.
	   ``You see, you had all these preconceived notions about me being
brave and all that. Besides, I didn't think that we'd ever be in a
situation like tonight's.
	   ``Folks are usually scared off by my sheer mass and shy away
from my modern meaning. Not many stick around long enough to know
my true self.
	   You must despise me now,'' Muscle sighed.
	   As I said, under any other circumstances I would have scoffed in
disgust and stomped away. But I was feeling serene, must have been
them endorphins or whatever those hormones released during extended
physical activity are called.
	   So, with atypical compassion, I rested my arm across the wide
expanse of Muscle's shoulder and held it like that for seemingly
eons.
	   ``I don't hate you. I just won't have you as a bodyguard. I
thought I could have a two-in-one deal,'' I said.
	   ``You know what they say about humanity and mice, don't you?''
Muscle asked, a slightly bolder smile dancing across its lips this
time.
	   ``What?''
	   ``It's said that `the best laid schemes o'mice an' men, gang aft
a-gley,''
	   Muscle said.
	   ``What does that mean?''
	   Muscle said: ``Simple (musclehead).
	   ``Things don't always go the way you planned for 'em to.''
	   Why, you don't say!

Bowe pleads guilty to abducting wife
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of crime, CLARIFIES that he
faces lighter sentence under plea agreement; trims.  
  By PAUL NOWELL  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Former heavyweight boxing
champion Riddick Bowe pleaded guilty Thursday to abducting his wife
and children from their suburban home after threatening to use a
knife, handcuffs and pepper spray.
	   He faces a minimum of 18 to 24 months in prison under a plea
bargain agreement.
	   Bowe pleaded guilty to a charge of interstate domestic violence
_ the same charge on which he was indicted Tuesday _ but the
agreement will give him a lighter sentence than the maximum 10
years in prison and dlrs 250,000 fine he could have received,
attorneys said. He will be sentenced within 90 days.
	   Bowe declined to address the court, answering only ``yes, sir''
when asked a series of questions by the magistrate, including
whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal by
pleading guilty.
	   Bowe, 30, of Fort Washington, Maryland, was accused of arriving
at his wife Judy's home on Feb. 25 in Cornelius, a northern
Charlotte suburb, and forcing her and their five children to
accompany him to his Maryland home. She managed to get help in the
neighboring state of Virginia and did not complete the trip.
	   During testimony Thursday, investigators said Bowe showed up
with duct tape, a knife, pepper spray and handcuffs and threatened
to use them. At some point in the ensuing hours, according to
testimony, he inflicted a superficial knife wound on Mrs. Bowe's
left breast.
	   Bowe drove about 200 miles (320 kilometers) before stopping at a
restaurant in South Hill, Virginia, where Mrs. Bowe was able to
telephone her sister in Cornelius, police said.
	   At the restaurant, Mrs. Bowe told authorities she and her
children did not want to go to Maryland, so police arranged for
them to be returned to their home.
	   Later that day, Bowe entered a medical treatment center for
counseling and therapy, his manager said.
	   Bowe was permitted to go free after Thursday's proceedings.
Within 10 days he must post a dlrs 250,000 secured bond, submit to
electronic monitoring and not return to North Carolina without
notifying his wife's attorneys.
	   The boxer has had other troubles since leaving the sport.
	   In May 1997, shortly after Bowe announced his retirement, he and
his sister, Velma Melton, were involved in a spat in which both
reportedly suffered split lips. Bowe quickly announced a
reconciliation.
	   Bowe joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1997 and reported for
three months of basic training, but he dropped out 11 days later.
	   The Bowes, who were high school sweethearts, are in divorce
proceedings.

Russia urges Ethiopia, Eritrea talks on border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia urged Ethiopia and Eritrea on Thursday to
begin talks on a border conflict as soon as possible.
	   New skirmishes broke out May 6 between the two countries on the
Horn of Africa.
	   Ethiopia accused Eritrea of illegally occupying a
(415-square-kilometer) 160-square-mile area known as the Yirga
triangle in northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half-dozen smaller areas
along the border.
	   ``The tension on the border between the two neighboring
countries may develop into an armed conflict which may exacerbate
the already difficult situation,'' Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Williams sibling rivalry in doubles finals
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Williams sisters will finally get to play each
other in a final on Friday at the French Open.
	   The sisters have met in tournament play only twice in their
professional careers, in the second round of this year's Australian
Open and in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open.
	   This time, though, the matchup isn't singles but mixed doubles.
Serena was knocked out of the singles in the fourth round by No. 4
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Venus lost in the quarterfinals to
top-seeded Martina Hingis.
	   In the mixed doubles final, Venus plays with Justin Gimmelstob
and Serena plays with Luis Lobo.

	   KISS AND TELL: When Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo appeared in
the dignitaries box Monday to watch Cedric Pioline beat Marat
Safin, he was joined by teen queen Anna Kournikova. In between
signing, autographs Ronaldo kissed Kournikova.
	   Back in the dressing room, other players inundated Kournikova
with questions: ``Is it true, did you kiss Ronaldo?''
	   ``No,'' the self-assured 17-year-old answered. ``He kissed me.''
	     ---  
	   FORGETFUL: Was Jim Courier in a hurry or just very disappointed
after his second-round loss to Jens Knippschild of Germany?
	   When Courier left the French Open immediately after his defeat,
he left behind one of his rackets which he had dropped off at the
racket stringers.
	     ---  
	   A WALK IN THE PARK: There's just no stopping Alex Corretja.
After his quarterfinals victory over Filip Dewulf on Wednesday, he
went for a run.
	   Corretja was seen jogging in the nearby Bois de Boulogne,
accompanied only by his coach. That brought back memories of a
former two-time French Open champion with the same habits: Jim
Courier.

Gadhafi cancels visit to Egypt, no reasons given

  EDS: CORRECTS anniversary to 31st sted of 11th in 3rd graf;
CLARIFIES visit was first postponed to Friday then canceled.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has canceled a
visit to Egypt that has already been postponed twice in one week,
Libyan officials said late Thursday.
	   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity did not give
any reason for the cancellation and gave no new date for his visit.
They spoke to reporters in the Egyptian town of Marsa Matrouh, near
the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Gadhafi was expected in Egypt on Tuesday but his trip was
postponed until Friday. The officials said he would not be arriving
Friday because it coincided with the 31st anniversary of the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Then they announced the visit was canceled.
	   Gadhafi, was expected on a 10-day visit for meetings with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, economists, university students,
academics and workers.

Switzerland rejects call for task force chief to step down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Thursday rejected an
Israeli lawmaker's demand for the resignation of the head of the
Swiss task force looking into the country's dealings during World
War II.
	   Israeli Knesset member Avraham Hirschson had called for the
resignation of Thomas Borer, saying the Swiss official made
anti-Semitic remarks during a trip to Israel last month.
	   But Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Franz Egle said Borer's
possible resignation was not even ``under discussion.''
	   Hirschson, chairman of an Israeli parliamentary panel on
restitution for Holocaust victims, sent a letter to Swiss President
Flavio Cotti Thursday saying Borer should either ``apologize,
clarify his statement or resign'' for remarks allegedly made on
Israeli radio during Cotti's trip to Israel last month.
	   According to Hirschson, Borer said demands by Jewish leaders for
cash compensation to Holocaust victims from the Swiss were
``disgusting.''
	   Hirschson told The Associated Press on Thursday that he had been
approached by Holocaust survivors who found the alleged remarks
anti-Semitic and deeply offensive.
	   ``I think Borer's statement was quite inappropriate for a man
charged with a mission which is so sensitive to the Jews, as well
as the Swiss,'' Hirschson said.
	   Egle said Borer firmly rejected the accusations and condemned
anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms, he added.

Rights group condemns Ghana for arresting journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ An international press watchdog group lodged
a complaint Friday with President Jerry Rawlings after Ghanaian
authorities allegedly detained and harassed two exiled Nigerian
journalists.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said Ghana
immigration authorities arrested and detained Bunmi Aborisade and
Lewis Asubiojo on May 27 and threatened to deport them for working
illegally and conducting ``high-profile activism in the affairs of
Nigeria.''
	   Asubiojo works for Accra's weekly Independent newspaper and
Aborisade is a freelance reporter. Both have written stories openly
criticizing Nigeria's military regime for gross human rights
abuses.
	   Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has been a close personal ally
of Nigerian military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who has ruled his
country with an iron grip since taking power in a bloodless 1993
coup.
	   Journalists have come under increasing attack from Nigerian
authorities aheasd of Nigeria's planned August elections, in which
Abacha is expected to be sole candidate.
	   The CPJ urged Taylor to end the ``harassment and threats of
deportation against foreign-born journalists'' and ensure that
journalists were not deported to countries where their lives could
be in danger.

Muslim group warns authorities not to try to disarm members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of a fundamentalist Islamic sect
circulated leaflets warning authorities in the southern Russian
region of Dagestan not to try to disarm them, a news agency said
Thursday.
	   The leaflet says any use of force will result in severe
consequences, regional security officials told ITAR-Tass, which did
not elaborate.
	   Wahhabis are fundamentalist Muslims who Russian officials have
blamed for recent violence in several parts of the former Soviet
Union, including Dagestan.
	   Dagestani villagers believed to be Wahhabis clashed last month
with police who were trying to disarm them. One policeman was
killed.

Hints of movement in long-stalled Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with NRP statement in 11th graf  
  By HILARY APPELMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ There were signs of movement Thursday in the
long-stalled Mideast peace process, with hopeful assessments from
both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   American officials expect a decision from Israel within days on
a proposed U.S. plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the plan, which has
yet to be made public.
	   ``There has been some progress in the direction of an agreement
that will be good for all sides,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Jerusalem. ``But I can't tell you what or when until it is
completed.''
	   Asked if there would be a withdrawal soon, Arafat, returning to
the Gaza Strip on Thursday night from a trip to Jordan and Yemen,
said, ``I hope so.''
	   Arafat said the Americans had promised that ``Everything will be
complete'' no later than mid-June.
	   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz published Thursday what it said
was the complete U.S. initiative, under which a total 40 percent of
the West Bank would come under Palestinian control and Israel would
agree not to expand Jewish settlements.
	   Details of the plan have been reported in the past, but the
Haaretz report was the first to give its full scope.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points of the
initiative as published in Haaretz. A U.S. official, however, said
on condition of anonymity that the plan as printed was not
accurate, and Netanyahu said it was ``simply not up to date.''
	   But with signs that a deal could be near, all sides were
jockeying for position Thursday.
	   The Land of Israel Front, a group of right-wing legislators that
has threatened to bring down Netanyahu's government if he agrees to
a West Bank troop withdrawal, said Thursday it would reconsider its
plans if Netanyahu agreed to a referendum before carrying out any
pullout.
	   Earlier in the week, the National Religious Party, part of
Netanyahu's coalition, said it would vote against any withdrawal
but would not vote to bring the government down.
	   Under the reported plan, Israel would withdraw troops in three
stages over 12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control
over 3 percent of the West Bank and partial control over another 24
percent. According to Haaretz, at the end of the pullback, they
would have full control over 18.2 percent and partial control over
22 percent, for a total of 40 percent _ a possible springboard for
statehood.
	   Talks on a permanent peace accord would begin immediately with
the first troop pullback.
	   In the agreement, Israel promises not to expand Jewish
settlements in a significant way, says it will refrain from
demolishing 1,800 Palestinian homes currently slated for
construction and restricts land confiscations.
	   In another nod to the Palestinians, sections of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction will be annulled by vote
of the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather than the much
larger Palestine National Council, as demanded by Israel.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, will not question Israeli
credentials at the United Nations, and Arafat will outlaw
incitement against Israel and systematically confiscate illegal
weapons.
	   A trilateral committee will meet every two weeks to discuss
security matters, and an American-Palestinian committee will follow
up on the cases of suspected Palestinian militants. Israel has
complained about a revolving-door policy under which Arafat arrests
Islamic militants for show and then quickly releases them.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Netanyahu had embraced most of
the Amerian proposals, including a 13 percent troop pullback over
12 weeks, and that the key sticking point now was the scope of an
additional withdrawal. Netanyahu wants to limit that pullback to 2
percent, but the Palestinians said they expected a more generous
offer.
	   ``We will never agree to a 2 percent redeployment,'' Asfour told
The Associated Press. Asfour said that under the American plan, the
scope of the next pullback was to be negotiated at a later time and
not included in the current package.
	   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met with senior Palestinian negotiators
in London on Thursday.
	   President Ezer Weizman was briefed by Netanyahu on the
negotiations Thursday and said afterward, ``I don't want to say
that it is over yet, but I am more optimistic than in the past.''

Government tightening noose on human rights groups, activists say
</HEADLINE>
  By MAE GHALWASH  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Human rights activists said Thursday the
government was trying to ``suffocate'' civil liberties with a new
law that threatens to curb their activities.
	   The government is to submit a draft law to Parliament this month
that imposes restrictions on the works of human rights groups.
	   ``The law will totally suffocate civil societies,'' said Bahey
el-Din Hassan, head of the Cairo Center for Human Rights Studies.
	   ``People will not even be able to hold private intellectual
gatherings in their homes (without escaping) a two-year jail
sentence,'' he said.
	   Under the new law, human rights activists will have to register
with the government or face a two-year jail sentence and 10,000
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 3,000) fine.
	   Collecting funds or joining international or regional networks
carry the same penalties.
	   The Social Affairs Ministry will have to approve foreign funding
and of the human rights agencies and can also interfere with
membership in the groups. Persons wishing to resign from their
agencies will need the ministry's approval.
	   Activists have long complained of physical harassment, forced
cancellations of their meetings and government defamation tactics
like accusations of spying for foreign states.
	   The government says the activists _ who have reported on human
rights abuses, especially in prisons _ are harming the country's
image.
	   The move is the latest in a series of government crackdown on
civil liberties, that has included the Egyptian press.
	   ``Its our turn,'' said Gasser Abdel-Razek, head of the Center
for Legal Rights and Human Aid.
	   Some 18 human rights groups currently function as private civil
companies.
	   The draft law is virtually the same as the 1964 law, but adds
more restrictions _ an ironic outcome of a long battle by activists
to amend it.
	   Social Affairs Minister Mervat el-Tellawi said the draft law
will facilitate the registration of non-governmental organizations
and win them government backing.

Akinwande hopes to put Lewis fight behind him against Holyfield
</HEADLINE>
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The last time Henry Akinwande fought for the
heavyweight title, he had his arms locked around Lennox Lewis so
often that he was finally disqualified in the fifth round for doing
more holding than fighting.
	   The referee went so far as to suggest Akinwande was scared
stiff.
	   So why, less than a year later, is the former Nigerian Olympian
getting another chance at a title Saturday night against Evander
Holyfield?
	   ``It's real simple,'' Holyfield said. ``He's with Don King.''
	   Promotional ties sometimes count more than ability in boxing, a
big reason why Akinwande will enter the ring at Madison Square
Garden to fight Holyfield for his WBA heavyweight title.
	   It's a fight Holyfield doesn't much want, though he will pick up
a dlrs 10 million payday to add to the dlrs 175 million he has
already made in the ring. But talks with Lewis over a title
unification fight went nowhere, and Akinwande gets the shot by
virtue of his No. 1 ranking by the WBA.
	   ``There's no other reason for this fight other than he's ranked
No. 1,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield is a 7-1 favorite to retain his title against
Akinwande, who followed his loss to Lewis last July with an
uninspiring 12-round decision over Orlin Norris, Jr., to get his
top ranking by the WBA.
	   That's not to say the 6-foot-7 (2.01-meter) Akinwande can't
fight. The Lewis fight was his only defeat as a pro, and he has
shown some talent to go along with his size in winning 33 fights.
	   And you can never count out a fighter with a wingspan that
measures more than seven feet (2.13 meters) across. Akinwande not
only towers over Holyfield by at least five inches (13
centimeters), he enjoys a four-inch (10-centimeter) reach
advantage.
	   ``I don't have anything to prove,'' Akinwande said. ``I just
have to prove something to myself. I've been doing this job for a
long time and just because I lost one fight doesn't make me a bad
fighter.''
	   Akinwande had held the fringe WBO heavyweight title before
giving it up to fight Lewis for the WBC crown. Before losing to
Lewis, only a draw against Axel Schulz in 1992 marred an otherwise
perfect record.
	   But Akinwande has always been defense-minded in the ring, and he
hasn't responded well to fighters who pressure him, as Holyfield is
sure to do.
	   ``He's had a lack of confidence in the ring before,'' said
Emanuel Steward, who trains Lewis and was brought in to train
Akinwande for the fight. ``I have seen a drastic change in the
things he's done in the gym the last few weeks but we'll have to
see if he has it during the fight. He's going to have to prove it
to me.''
	   Akinwande bristles at the suggestion he was intimidated by Lewis
and refused this week to even discuss a performance made
particularly embarrassing because it came just a few weeks after
Mike Tyson bit Holyfield in their title fight.
	   ``I'm not embarrassed about nothing,'' Akinwande said.
``Sometimes you have a good night, sometimes you have a bad
night.''
	   If Akinwande comes to fight this time around, the bout is likely
to be determined by how easily Holyfield gets inside against
Akinwande's long arms. If Akinwande chooses to hold, as he did
against Lewis, it could be a long and boring fight.
	   ``Eventually I'll get around his arms, but I don't know how,''
Holyfield said. ``I've been boxing for 27 years, and my arms won't
get any longer before fight time. I'll just have to use my foot
speed against him.''
	   The fight tops a card at Madison Square Garden that features an
improbable title challenge by 46-year-old Roberto Duran against WBA
middleweight champion William Joppy and appearances by super
batamweight champion Johnny Tapia and popular female fighter
Christy Martin.

  EDS: UPDATES with memorial service  
  By ANNE THOMPSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ The parish pastor had no explanations
for a hundred deaths in the railway disaster that struck his quiet
town. Neither did a Roman Catholic bishop who joined the Lutheran
pastor for a memorial service Thursday.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,'' the
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people at the
Johanniskirche (St. John Church).
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop from Hildesheim, Josef Homeyer, who
read a message of consolation from Pope John Paul II.
	   ``God has poured grief into our hearts,'' Homeyer said in his
own sermon. `` All words and explanations and even our questions
have died with the victims. With the dead, a piece of our hearts
has died.''
	   About 80 people, almost all of them reporters, listened to the
service over loudspeakers outside, while residents whose small town
was shocked by the tragedy took up most of the 400 seats inside.
	   Worried relatives of passengers on the train started arriving in
the red-roofed town of 4,000 looking for information after word of
the crash spread Wednesday. They stayed out of public view, many
taking shelter in a reception hall set up in a sports hall. The
window shades were drawn and a sign warning ``No Press'' was posted
on plastic sheets covering the door.
	   There was no way of knowing how many relatives had come to the
city. There was little for them to learn here. Bodies were taken to
a morgue in Hanover for identification and special numbers were set
up for people to inquire about a loved one.
	   Inside the small wooden church, the solemn messages of the
clergymen ``completely matched what I feel,'' said Guenter
Mittmann, 44, as he emerged from the service. ``This is something
that you just are at a loss to explain.''
	   Elisabeth Sischy, 33, followed the service outside with her
three kids, aged 7,3 and 16 months. She said the family had moved
from Hanover in April: ``We wanted to live a more quiet life and
this is a beautiful and quiet place which is why everyone here is
so shocked.''
	   At the crash scene, determined crews worked quietly to shift the
slabs of concrete that crushed passenger cars as the bridge
collapsed Wednesday.
	   As cars were pried free, workmen ripped them apart to be sure
they hadn't missed any of the victims.
	   Bernd Schlawer, 45, said he had crossed the wrecked bridge two
days earlier on a bicycle outing with five of his children.
	   A quiet, intense man, Schlawer handed over a Christian tract
that he said he regularly hands out at train stations and other
public areas. It warns that that life can end in a moment.
	   ``One second decided the fate of the Titanic,'' the leaflet
said. ``There is a tragic parallel in many people's lives. Again
and again, what counts is the decisive second _ suddenly the
trailer of the truck swerves, suddenly the steel girders buckle,
suddenly the heart attack...''
	   Schlawer said he hadn't distributed the leaflet widely since the
accident, but did share a copy with anyone who happened to speak to
him about the disaster.
	   ``Our life is so short. It just means we all need to be thinking
more about eternity,'' Schlawer said.

MALAYSIA has twice extended credit facilities totalling more

<TEXT>
than RM160 million to Iraq to buy palm oil, the Dewan Negara was
told yesterday.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Dr Leo Michael Toyad said Malaysia
also trained Iraqis in technical and public service sectors.
	   In 1993, Malaysia sent food and medicine supplies worth
RM740,000 to that country, he said.
	   The humanitarian aid was raised to RM5 million in 1996, he said
when replying to Senator Abu Bakar Ismail during Question Time.
	   He said Malaysia would continue to support efforts by the United
Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Conference to lift the
seven-year-old economic sanctions on Iraq and provide humanitarian
assistance to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people, particularly
the children.
	   Malaysia would continue to voice its support through
international and multilateral forums for initiatives by the UN
Security Council and other international bodies to restore peace in
countries facing political crises and civil war, he added.

IF you have heard one pop/ballad boy band, you have heard them

<TEXT>
all. Right?
	   Yes and no.
	   Yes, because it's true some can sound like empty, soulless
copies of the better, well-known bands; no, because once in a
while, if you really pay attention, you will find one worth your
time.
	   One such group is Germany's new pop-ballad trio Trademark.
Musically, the members - Achim Remling, 23, Sascha Sadeghlan, 26,
and Mirko Baumer, 29 - sound like a cross between Firehouse, Jon
Bon Jovi and Michael Learns To Rock.
	   Vocally, Remling has a sexier, rasping singing voice that sounds
like Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams, but Sadeghlan and Baumer are
equally strong singers with powerful but smooth vocals.
	   The guys sing a few varieties of love song, including a lovely
piece about the love of a parent for a child, My Child; they have a
nice balance of vocal harmony, melodious and tuneful.
	   Their 12-track debut album, Another Time, Another Place, is
sugar-coated; just the right diet for teenagers and die-hard MLTR
fans.
	   There are three fast-paced tracks - Talk, a nice pop tune with
wacky lyrics and dance rhythms, Moving On (Up Down), a dance track
with a bit of rap, and a pop-rock song, Standing On The Edge.
	   Trademark's two chart-climbing singles, I'll Be The One and I'm
Not Supposed To Love You Anymore, are well-written ballads about
hopes and promises made in the name of love, and the heartache that
comes when a marriage ends.
	   The singles are being spun on a few radio stations, while the
videoclips, shot in Germany and Bali, can be viewed over MTV Asia
on Astro.
	   During a recent telephone from Germany, Baumer, appointed
speaker of the group, spoke to the Press about their history
together.
	   ``I met Achim in school,'' says Baumer, who speaks English with
a distinct German accent, ``and we met Sascha in a pub where we
were all working as waiters.''
	   It was karaoke night at the pub; the laser disc player wasn't
working, so Sadeghlan went on stage with a piano-playing friend to
entertain the crowd.
	   Remling and Baumer, impressed by Sadeghlan's voice, joined him
on stage.
	   The impromptu entertainment went so well, they were promoted to
pub in-house band.
	   ``We called ourselves Housemarker,'' says Baumer.
	   From being an in-house band, they graduated to performing at
small concerts and shows. After a few successful appearances, they
landed a recording contract with BMG Berlin.
	   Since there was already a more successful German band around
with the same name, Housemarker became Trademark. Then, while
preparing for recording, ``we were invited to perform in Geld Oder
Liebe,'' continues Baumer, ``a major prime-time German television
show; but the condition was you needed to have an album.''
	   The trio jumped into action and in two months completed their
debut album. They got their spot on the show, were seen by millions
and sales of the album and single skyrocketed. In a matter of days,
Another Time, Another Place entered the German music chart at No.
26.
	   They haven't looked back since. According to Baumer, they are
all pretty happy with their new-found stardom in Germany.
	   The only bad experience they have had so far was playing in a
concert-cum-convention for Volkswagen lovers in Austria.
	   The audience cared more about the cars than about the band, who
left the stage depressed. ``We really felt awful that our music
came second best to the cars,'' says Baumer.
	   But that is in the past. Now they are happy about this month's
Asian tour.
	   Another Time, Another Place was released in Malaysia in April.
Trademark will be here for a promotional visit from June 8 to 13.
	   They will be at Sungei Wang Plaza in Kuala Lumpur on June 9 at
5.30pm, before visiting Sunshine Square and Rockworld in Penang on
June 10 at 5pm and 9pm respectively.
	   Trademark will then perform in Sarawak Plaza and Peppers
Discotheque in Kuching on June 11 at 6pm and 10.30pm, before
returning for a show at Zax Discotheque in Petaling Jaya on June 12
at 11.30pm.

such an event.
	   Among the activities held were cultural shows at Central Market
on May 30 and Auditorium Datuk K.R. Somasundaram on May 31, both in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   On Friday at 7.30pm, there will be a Sangeetham Recital Night at
the Vivekananda Ashram in Brickfields. Kuala Lumpur. The event,
open to the public, is aimed at promoting Indian classical music.
	   Chandra Sekaran said highlights of the programme are games and
competitions which will be held on Saturday from 9am to 5pm at the
Vivekananda Ashram.
	   These include thayam, palangkuzhi, kolam, adu puli attam,
rengoli, kudam decorating, thoranam, flower tying, art competition
and Bharatanatyam.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Higher rainfall in the past two days has

<TEXT>
resulted in the Semenyih and Langat dam levels stabilising, thereby
averting the need to implement contingency plans for rationing.
	   ``Following that, any plans to supply water once every three
days need not be implemented yet,'' Selangor Waterworks
Department's deputy director V.Subramaniam said at a Press
conference today.
	   He said increased rainfall had allowed production levels at the
Sungai Langat, Cheras, Ampang Intake and Sungai Semenyih water
treatment plants to rise above the 70 per cent satisfactory level
today.
	   ``Although water has been released continuously from the Langat
and Semenyih dams, the levels have more or less maintained at the
same level as yesterday's,'' he said.
	   Subramaniam said the situation for the past two days ``looked
threatening'' and added that the need to implement the contingency
plan in the future ``could happen at any time.''
	   Today's level at the Langat Dam remained the same as yesterday's
while the level at the Semenyih Dam had gone up. The level at the
Klang Gates dam however, fell 0.04 metres.
	   This was largely due to significant rainfall at the catchment
areas of the Langat and Semenyih dams.
	   Production levels of the three water treatment plants under the
Sungai Langat scheme went up to 77.7 per cent, compared to 48.3 per
cent yesterday.
	   The Sungai Semenyih water treatment plant also reached 80.3 per
cent.
	   On the plan to introduce once in three days rationing,
Subramaniam said it was merely one of several measures currently
being looked at.
	   ``Drilling works to tap ground water is already in progress near
the Sg Langat water treatment plant where the water tapped could be
treated at the treatment plant,'' he said.
	   In a related matter, calls from residents in Hulu Klang areas
flooded the New Straits Times, complaining that water which was due
to them yesterday did not arrive.
	   ``Although we understand that hours may have to be reduced, the
Department should have informed us beforehand,'' said a resident
from Taman Sri Rampai.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Residents and businesses in the Federal

<TEXT>
Capital will continue to get water supply although certain areas in
Bangsar, which shares the same water treatment plant, suffered from
dry taps yesterday.
	   The Selangor Waterworks Department deputy director V.
Subramaniam said today even though the production level of the
Bukit Nenas water treatment plant, which supplied water to most of
Kuala Lumpur, has dropped, there was no need to begin looking at
introducing rationing here.
	   ``Although the water level at the Klang Gates dam, which
supplies raw water to the Bukit Nenas plant has fallen, it is still
five metres above the critical level,'' said Subramaniam during a
Press conference at the Department headquarters.
	   He said with still enough water in the dam, there was no need to
consider rationing for the Kuala Lumpur area despite the fact that
several households in Bangsar Baru, which receives water from Bukit
Nenas, experienced dry taps yesterday.
	   The plant's production level, according to Subramaniam, had
dropped about 20 per cent, falling from the usual 38 million litres
per day to 30 mld.
	   ``The Bukit Nenas water treatment plant receives raw water
directly from Klang Gates through an underground pipe and cannot
benefit from any rainfall outside the dam's catchment area,'' he
said.
	   Subramaniam explained that water from the dam flowed to the
Bukit Nenas water treatment plant by relying on gravity and any
drop in water level at Klang Gates would affect the flow pressure.
	   He added that Bangsar and Brickfields are at the end of the
system supplied by Bukit Nenas and would therefore be immediately
affected by any drop in water production levels.

SAUFIAN Mokhtar, The Fly Guy on popular radio station Hitz FM
(92.9FM), was spot-on when he said: ``I can't believe there's so
much excitement over a bunch of TV commercials!''
The 3rd Malaysian Video Awards, which made their appearance last

<TEXT>
Friday after an absence last year, was - judging by the crowd's
response -a resounding success.
	   Held at the Tun Dr Ismail Hall, Putra World Trade Centre, the
place was packed with folk from the film and video industry, all
feted in a well-organised ceremony by the Malaysian Video Awards
Council with the support of the National Art Gallery.
	   The annual Awards show was conceived to celebrate ``invisible''
	   contributors to the film and video industry: technical and
logistics experts who turn ideas into reality on television and in
cinema halls.
	   The 3rd Malaysian Video Awards - the doors swung open at 7pm as
people trickled in and tucked into food and drink - kicked off in a
big and loud way at about 9pm with the help of a giant screen, a
video wall (a few television sets cubed together), some huge
speakers and plenty of enthusiasm.
	   The Fly Guy and fellow radio announcer Daphne Nasir played host
and hostess, successfully teasing and humouring guests throughout
the five-hour celebration.
	   The crowd, seated in groups of colleagues (yup - it is now
proven beyond doubt that workers in Malaysia can't get enough of
each other in the office; even after hours, they cling to each
other for dear life), was a happy one.
	   With some coming directly from work and most looking refreshed,
post-shower and in their gladrags, they were in high spirits. The
atmosphere rapidly became positively festive, nicely reflecting the
attitude of the Malaysian creative industry itself: people work
hard and they party even harder! As the two comperes announced
winners in 25 categories of competition, applause from friends and
those near and dear was heartening.
	   Winners were selected by both Malaysian and foreign judges, most
notably by 1997 Oscar-winner for best short animation film (Quest),
Thomas Stellmach, a director from Germany.
	   Most entries were television commercials; there were some music
videos, short documentaries and television series.
	   Although most winning entries were heavy on effects and left an
impression as deep as one-hit wonders in the music industry, some
award-winners that night were a better reflection of us as a
creative people, showing a flair for style and substance.
	   The audience saw some of this when winning entries were shown.
	   Interestingly, most winners were very young people, with the
potential of developing into masters of their craft - outgrowing
their current obsession for gimmicks and special effects.
	   The almost middle-aged Paul Loosley, who won with Webern for
best experimental video (professional), was undoubtedly the most
worthy winner of the night.
	   As for the evening's most exciting winner, that was the winner
of the best editing award, Terrence Manuel, for the Sony Z1
Handphone spot, Hero.
	   Predictably, the best graphics award was clinched by a team of
youngsters, for the AIM `98 opening montage.
	   The best music video award was won by KRU's Fanatik, while the
award for best sound effects/sound design was won by a short piece
entitled Dreamer.
	   One of the most stylised and sensual winners of the night was
the supersexy Anchor Beer TVC from Singapore, entitled Wedding,
which won the best editing (Asean) award.
	   Typical of things Singaporean, Wedding was bland in its casting
(complete with monotonous monoracial overtones), but the editing
made superb use of the poses struck by the two leads, taking this
TVC to another dimension.
	   Whew - ya shoulda seen the temperature rise when it was
screened! Pity we did not receive much material from Thailand.
Judging by some of the superb music videos screened over MTV, they
would definitely have made good viewing.
	   Hopefully we'll receive more entries from Asean next year, to
really see the standards in our region and gauge where we stand
with our peers.
	   In all, an impressive 465 entries were received for this year's
Malaysian Video Awards.
	   Meanwhile, as a departure for a society whose lifestyle is
becoming less gracious, we must salute Moon K. Chan, general
manager of VHQ Malaysia and Malaysian Video Awards Council
chairman, for having done a swell job for Malaysian video.
	   The night went smoothly, without technical glitches, and the
support from Moon's staff at VHQ - who provided most of the
manpower for the seminars and Awards night - was most impressive.
	   As Wairah Marzuki, director of the National Art Gallery, aptly
said: ``We also congratulate the organisers of the Malaysian Video
Awards ... most of all Moon Chan, who had the courage and vision to
initiate the awards.''

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Selangor Waterworks Department will not

<TEXT>
be allowed to implement its proposed three-day water rationing
schedule unless the situation becomes critical, Works Minister
Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said today.
	   He said even if the situation warrants JBA to impose the new
water rationing schedule, it must promptly revert to the one-day
water rationing schedule once the situation improves.
	   ``Hopefully we do not have to resort to such measures because as
we can see it has been raining heavily for the past few days and
from the information I have received, the water level of some dams
have marginally improved.''
	   Samy Vellu, who was speaking to reporters after a post cabinet
meeting at his office, said he will have a meeting with JBA's
officials to discuss the water rationing schedule.
	   On Monday, JBA issued a statement saying it was considering
several options, including providing water once in three days
instead of the current one-day interval, to allow it to stretch its
water resources.
	   It said the need to lengthen the water rationing period was due
to the large drop in the production of water at treatment plants
caused by the drop of river level.
	   On Puncak Niaga's study of the proposal to hasten pipe laying
connecting the Sungai Selangor Phase II water treatment plant with
areas in Kuala Lumpur, Samy Vellu said the company had asked for
more time.
	   He said Puncak Niaga which submitted its report yesterday had
not been able to meet the deadline because it was still studying
the budget needed for the proposal.

Scientists may have found some of the universe's ``missing mass''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a revolutionary finding that may change
fundamental theories about the past and future of the universe,
physicists announced Friday they have evidence that the neutrino _
an elusive, subatomic particle _ has mass, or weight.
	   If proven correct, the discovery in an underground lab in
central Japan by an international team of scientists would force a
revision of a central theory of modern science and help solve the
mystery of why the universe isn't as heavy as science says it
should be.
	   Neutrinos are one of the basic building blocks of atoms and, in
turn, everything else. They are also particularly elusive.
Neutrinos have no charge and are so small that they pass right
through matter, making them very tricky to track.
	   Physics' ``standard model'' theory of how fundamental particles
work decrees that neutrinos should weigh nothing at all.
	   A team of 120 scientists working on a project known as the
Super-Kamiokande Experiment, believe they have found evidence that
proves that part of the theory needs to be reconsidered.
	   While they can't measure a neutrino's mass, they have evidence
that strongly suggests it has some.
	   ``This is something that physicists have hoped for and eagerly
sought for decades,'' said John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the
Institute for Advanced Study and a visiting professor at Princeton
University.
	   ``It is a huge step forward.''
	   Neutrinos come in three types _ physicists call them flavors _
named according to what other subatomic particles they hang around
with. There are electron-neutrinos, muon-neutrinos, and
tau-neutrinos.
	   The scientists in Japan say they have detected that some
neutrinos oscillate, or change type, as they pass through space or
matter. And another widely accepted theory of physics says anything
that oscillates has got to have mass.
	   ``We are very confident that this proves it,'' said Chang Kee
Jung, member of the project team and a professor of Physics and
Astronomy from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
	   ``We're now going from the standard model into the next level of
physics,'' he said.
	   And neutrino mass also could help explain another thorny
problem: why the weight of the planets, stars and all other known
stuff in the cosmos, when added together, is so much less than the
model of the universe predicts.
	   The visible universe makes up barely 10 percent of that
theoretical matter, leading astronomers to conclude that much more
of it is hidden in mysterious dark spots or that the theory is
seriously flawed.
	   The mass of an individual neutrino is likely infinitesimally
small _ perhaps billions of times less than an electron, the
particle with the smallest known mass.
	   But there are so many neutrinos that, together, they could
account for a lot of the universe's mysteriously missing mass.
	   A neutrino with mass also could play a crucial role in how the
stars and other celestial objects formed and moved over the
billions of years since the universe was born, and how the universe
will evolve in the future.
	   The current thinking is that the universe began expansion at the
Big Bang and will continue expansion forever _ scientists now have
to decide whether the finding that the neutrino has mass changes
that.
	   The group in Japan, which includes researchers from Japan, the
United States, Germany and Poland, detected neutrinos using a
50,000-ton tank filled with highly purified water down a
half-mile-deep mine shaft in the central Japan city of Takayama.
	   Surrounding the tank are 13,000 photomultiplier tubes that
detect the faintest flash of light. The apparatus was buried in the
mine to block cosmic rays and radiation.
	   Nuclear fusion at the sun's core produces neutrinos which are
then hurled this way at the speed of light. The scientists hoped
that at least a few of the trillions of particles that hit earth
every second would pass through their tank, collide with an atom
there and set off a little flash of light they could detect and
measure.
	   Their conclusion that neutrinos have mass came after a year of
constant data collection. Statistical analysis of the data, Jung
said, strongly suggested that some of the neutrinos had changed
type.
	   The researchers likely will have to wait for another laboratory
to repeat their experiment and findings before it is accepted as
scientific fact.
	   The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, 200 miles (320 kilometers)
north of Toronto, is conducting similar experiments; only a handful
of such facilities exist.

World Cup: Weary from the traffic chaos, Spanish squad arrives in
</HEADLINE>
Chantilly  
  By CIARAN GILES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Looking weary from traffic chaos both
in the air and on the ground around Paris, the Spanish national
side arrived at this chateau town just north of the capital
Thursday to begin its final preparations for the World Cup.
	   An angry looking Javier Clemente showed no sign of statisfaction
from his side's 4-1 victory Wednesday over Northern Ireland in a
friendly and led his 22-man squad straight into the Hotel Blue
Green without even a gesture of greeting to the waiting staff who
had lined the steps to welcome them.
	   Spanish federation officials said the team was exhausted from
delays at the airport due to the Air France pilots' strike as well
as from the snarled traffic from Charles De Gaulle airport to
nearby Chantilly.
	   Minutes after arriving, however, Clemente and several of his
assistants left the hotel to inspect the nearby training ground,
following reports that the pitch was in poor condition and did not
meet FIFA's standard.
	   ``The reports we have received regarding the training ground
have not been good,'' federation spokesman Fernando Garrido said.
``We'll see what Clemente thinks.''
	   French news reports on Tuesday cited the town's mayor as saying
if Spain was not happy with the Borgogones training complex, it
could look elsewhere.
	   Spain is scheduled to hold its first practice at the grounds
Friday morning.
	   According to Garrido, Spain has two players still nursing
injuries _ veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, who has been hampered
by left leg muscle problems for more than a week, and striker
Francisco ``Kiko'' Narvaez, who has been taking strong pain
medication following a recent tooth extraction.
	   Both players are expected to be fully recovered before Spain
kicks off its Group D schedule against Olympic champion Nigeria on
June 13 in western coastal city of Nantes.
	   Among the good omens has been the recovery of Real Madrid
striker Raul Gonzalez Blanco from a groin injury, who played the
first half Wednesday and then stepped off to make way for Madrid
teammate and fellow youngster Fernando Morientes.
	   Playing his second game, Morientes scored two of Spain's goals
to add to the two he scored in his debut for the national team last
month against Sweden. Juan Pizzi, meanwhile, accounted for the
other two, showing that his season-long benching at FC Barcelona
has not blunted his scoring abilities.
	   The victory means that except the 1-0 defeat earlier this year
against World Cup host France in a friendly game to inaugurate the
Stade de France, Spain has remained unbeaten since Italy knocked it
out of the World Cup quarterfinals in 1994.
	   Nonetheless, Clemente was not ebullient with the team's
performance.
	   ``We're missing that competitive spark,'' he told Spanish
reporters. ``Between now and the 13th, when we start (the World
Cup), we will have to find it.''
	   Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic witnessed the match and he too
saw weaknesses.
	   ``I'd highlight Spain's character and organization, but I've
seen some faults which we will try to capitalize on,'' Milutinovic
said.

Switzerland rejects call for task force chief to step down
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CHANGES fifth graf to indicate Hirschson spoke specifically
about level of compensation demands; RECASTS to trim.  

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Thursday rejected an
Israeli lawmaker's demand for the resignation of the head of the
Swiss task force looking into the country's dealings during World
War II.
	   Israeli Knesset member Avraham Hirschson had called for the
resignation of Thomas Borer, saying the Swiss official made
anti-Semitic remarks during a trip to Israel last month.
	   But Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Franz Egle said Borer's
possible resignation was not even ``under discussion.''
	   Hirschson, chairman of an Israeli parliamentary panel on
restitution for Holocaust victims, sent a letter to Swiss President
Flavio Cotti Thursday saying Borer should either ``apologize,
clarify his statement or resign'' for remarks allegedly made on
Israeli radio during Cotti's trip to Israel last month.
	   According to Hirschson, Borer apparently said the level of
demands by Jewish leaders for cash compensation to Holocaust
victims _ which Hirschson said ran into billions of dollars _ from
the Swiss, was ``disgusting.''
	   Hirschson told The Associated Press on Thursday he had been
approached by Holocaust survivors who found the alleged remarks
anti-Semitic and deeply offensive.
	   ``I think Borer's statement was quite inappropriate for a man
charged with a mission which is so sensitive to the Jews, as well
as the Swiss,'' Hirschson said.
	   Egle said Borer firmly rejected the accusations and condemned
anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms, he added.

KUANTAN, Wed. - The State Government sought expert advice before

<TEXT>
it gave a 202ha timber concession in the Dagui Valley in Sungai
Lembing in 1992, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Khalil Yaakob said
today.
	   This was to ensure that the logging would not affect water
sources.
	   ``We have consulted the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia,
which has stated that logging could be carried out there,'' he told
reporters after chairing the State executive council meeting.
	   Logging is not allowed in the State's catchment areas and
certain quarters said the concession was located in the Sungai
Lembing catchment.
	   They have asked the State Government to study the implications
of extracting timber from the area.
	   Khalil said the concession was located outside the 11,200ha
gazetted catchment area.
	   ``Furthermore, there is a hill separating the timber concession
from Sungai Kelui, a tributary of Sungai Kuantan. So, the question
of logging activities polluting the river does not arise,'' he
said.
	   Khalil said though the concession in the Dagui Valley was
awarded way back in 1992, work to extract the timber only started
recently.
	   ``As the project involves only logging activities and not other
forms of development, there is no need for the affected parties to
come up with an Environmental Impact Assessment report.''

	   UNITED Engineers (Malaysia) Bhd is in the midst of finalising
its negotiations with a potential buyer for its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Bhd (PLUS).
	   ``We are very close to finalising this,'' said its managing
director Datuk Dr Ramli Mohamad, adding that an announcement is
expected to be made within a month's time.
	   ``We are still talking to the potential buyer on the final price
and stake,'' he told reporters after UEM's annual general meeting
in Subang Jaya yesterday.
	   Declining to name the buyer, Ramli said the buyer prefers to
remain anonymous until the deal is signed.
	   Asked if the stake involved is about 20 per cent as reported
earlier in the press, he said: ``We are looking at something around
that.''
	   UEM's stock ended yesterday's trade at RM2.28 with 3.696 million
shares done, the sixth most active counter from RM2.15 on Tuesday.
Last week, the price was between RM2.29 and RM2.46.
	   It was earlier reported in the press that UEM is disposing of
its 20 per cent stake in PLUS to raise some RM1.5 billion to repay
some debts.
	   The Employees Provident Fund was believed to have been
approached by UEM to take up the equity although industry sources
had said the former was not too keen to invest in PLUS.
	   Ramli said although PLUS may be considered as the group's
``jewel in the crown'', UEM needs to sell it, ``because we need the
cash. It is a stake we can sell a part of and still retain control
... if we sell something that is worth a lot less, we will have to
sell everything''.
	   He added that if the stake is in the region of 20 per cent, ``it
will not be a significant loss to the shareholders''.
	   In UEM's 1997 annual report, it was mentioned that at the
company level, its debt was about RM2.80 billion, RM2.34 billion of
which was for the purchase of the controversial 32.6 per cent stake
in Renong.
	   When UEM first announced that it had bought the stake in Renong
last November in the open market, the market was shocked as many
viewed the deal as an attempt to bail out Renong and its executive
chairman, Tan Sri Halim Saad, both said to be cash-strapped.
	   Halim dismissed the accusations while UEM's management pointed
out that being an infrastructure company with projects that have
long gestation periods, it is only natural to see the heavy loans
that were taken to finance them in the group's accounts.
	   In reassuring UEM's minority shareholders that the company was
not suffering any loss, Halim had agreed to grant UEM a put option
where he may be required to acquire all of UEM's stake in Renong -
a proposal that was finally approved by shareholders last February
14 during a four-hour extraordinary general meeting.
	   At the group level, the debt totalled RM11.21 billion of which
most of the amount was in the form of non-recourse project
financing, which meant that the loans were taken for financing
specific projects and were prepaid from revenues from those
projects.
	   Ramli said to refinance its debts after the (PLUS) sale, the
company is currently in talks with several bankers and lenders.
	   Asked how significant will the proceeds from the sale be for it
to reduce its debts, he said it will be ``significant and our cash
flow will be able to sustain what remains''.
	   The group is examining several financial instruments for the
refinancing, he said, adding that ``we have to decide first how
much (debts) we can sustain and then decide on the instrument''.
	   UEM has valued PLUS at RM7.5 billion on a discounted cash-flow
basis with the average cost of capital pegged at 12 per cent. This
is based on the assumption that PLUS will get to raise toll rates
by 6-7 per cent this year and traffic will grow 3 per cent per
year.
	   Ramli, however, said from the feedback the group got from their
on-going talks with the Government, ``we do not think we will get
it (the toll raise for PLUS's North-South Expressway) for the time
being due to the economic situation''.
	   He said the company is prepared for this but may not be able to
sustain it if this persists beyond this year.
	   He noted that under the concession agreement, PLUS is protected
as it will be paid compensation, ``but the question now is when. We
are open to ideas ... we may be able to take a temporary deferral
but not for long''.
	   Ramli said close to 90 per cent of the toll collected by PLUS
goes to the lenders or banks, ``and if we don't get the increase
soon enough, the quality of PLUS service (to road users) will be
affected''.
	   In 1996, when the toll increase was also delayed, PLUS had
losses of some RM170 million.
	   On the restraining order obtained by a Phillipine citizen last
week to prevent the company from collecting toll at its 6.5km
Manila-Cavite Toll Expressway (MCTE), Ramli said UEM hopes to
resolve it by this week.
	   Expecting a quick decision to be made on this one, Ramli said,
``if we are unable to lift the order and re-commence, tolling will
be affected''.
	   The 6.5km stretch of the MCTE forms the first phase of the
expressway project in which some RM100 million has been invested by
UEM.

Iraq says it is not hiding illegal weapons
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with French and Chinese comment
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq is deceiving the United Nations about
its weapons programs and ``this must stop'' if Baghdad expects to
see sanctions lifted, the U.S. envoy said Thursday, after a
briefing by U.N. inspectors to the Security Council.
	   The Security Council met Thursday for a second straight day to
hear chief inspector Richard Butler report on the arms inspection
program. Butler will meet with Iraqi officials in Baghdad next week
to spell out what disarmament steps they must take before he can
recommend an end to sanctions.
	   Butler said his teams were ``on the edge of accounting'' for all
chemical or biological artillery shells but the gap in Iraq's
stocks of biological agents is ``fairly large.''
	   But he said there was a possibility that the inspectors may
never achieve ``100 percent verification'' in some weapons areas.
He said the council must ultimately decide ``how much is enough.''
	   ``What was presented here was very sobering, very disturbing,''
Ambassador Bill Richardson said. He said that although Iraq had
destroyed Soviet-supplied long-range missiles, the inspectors
provided evidence that the Iraqis tested and deployed locally
manufactured missiles.
	   ``This is extremely serious,'' Richardson said. ``Indeed, Iraq
will not show (the inspectors) even one remnant of these supposedly
secretly destroyed missiles.''
	   British Ambassador John Weston said the briefings by Russian,
French, German, Australian and Argentine officials showed Iraq had
not yet met conditions for ending sanctions.
	   In Baghdad, a senior Iraqi official insisted Iraq was is not
hiding illegal weapons. ``If they have information (about weapons),
let them give it to us,'' Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed
Rashid, told The Associated Press. ``We will verify it.''
	   He said Butler, was trying to raise doubts among council members
``to block the lifting of sanctions.''
	   During the two-day briefing, Butler presented aerial photographs
and other documents to justify his claims that Iraq has failed to
comply with U.N. orders, issued after the 1991 Gulf War, to destroy
all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the council to lift crippling
economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf War.
	   During the meeting, diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said envoys from Russia, China and France questioned
some of Butler's comments. But they made no public statements
critical of the inspection program.
	   China's ambassador, Qun Huasun, said his government hoped ``the
weapons file will be closed and the sanctions lifted at an early
date.'' Diplomats said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet told the
council he agreed Iraq had hidden weapons but wanted to know when
the inspections would end.
	   Richardson said, 14th graf

	   MALAYSIA's rice distributor Padiberas Nasional Bhd will reduce
its current high dependence on rice by diversifying into other food
items, which will allow the group to enlarge its business and
earnings base.
	   This will draw upon the group's current and future networks in
both the local and international food trade, says its managing
director, Encik Mohd Ibrahim Mohd Nor.
	   Bernas is currently studying the food import bill and has yet to
determine the type of food that it plans to market. Apart from rice
distribution, the group has started marketing its new product -
Bernas mineral water.
	   ``We expect to complete the study in three months, and by then
we hope to list down the food items,'' Ibrahim said after Bernas
annual general meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   ``We think this is a very necessary step to take to reduce our
dependency on rice distribution and in order to face the increasing
globalisation of the world food trade,'' he said.
	   Ibrahim declined to comment on whether the move into food
marketing will contribute to the group's earnings for the next
financial year ending December 31 1999.
	   ``However, we hope to see the results in the next three to five
years,'' he said.
	   Asked whether the group plans to shift to meat processing
business - which it is currently operating in Australia through its
60 per cent-owned subsidiary Meatco Pty Ltd - he said that it will
not be so soon.
	   ``We are comfortable playing on the international angle,'' he
said, adding that however, Bernas will still like to play its role
to reduce the country's dependency on imported livestock.
	   It is believed that Bernas is looking at several markets to
import beef including Africa.
	   Meanwhile, Bernas also plans to move into the consultancy and
technology provider business in the next three to five years, with
the development of its new large-scale farming system.
	   Bernas is currently developing a new technology for large-scale
farming for padi with its pilot scheme in Gadung, Sarawak. The
project will be carried out on a 160ha piece of land and involves
an investment of RM15 million.
	   The project, which is expected to start by the middle of this
month is undertaken by a joint-venture company, BM Agrotech Sdn Bhd
which is jointly set up by Bernas and Marditech Corp Sdn Bhd.
	   Bernas has also appointed an expert, Mr Jerry Lee Bogard, from
the US to develop the technology.
	   Bernas holds a 51 per cent equity stake in BM Agrotech while
Marditech has 39 per cent and Bogard ten per cent.
	   If it successful, Bernas plans to export the technology to
emerging countries like Vietnam and Myanmar as well as China.
	   The project is also expected to reduce the country's dependency
on rice import from Thailand and Pakistan, and increase the
domestic supply of rice.
	   ``However, it depends on how fast this project may progress,''
Ibrahim said, adding that Malaysia imports about 30 per cent of its
rice annually.
	   He also said that Bernas plans to contribute between 600,000 and
650,000 tonnes of rice, which represent about 30 per cent of the
total rice consumption in Malaysia for this year. Demand for this
year is around 1.8 billion tonnes.

PETALING JAYA, Wed. - A 26-year-old security guard was found

<TEXT>
dead with multiple stab wounds on his body in an uncompleted
condominium block along Jalan 16/15 today.
	   A worker at the construction site found K. Sukumar's body at the
ground floor of the building about 9am.
	   Selangor Deputy Criminal Investigation Department chief
Assistant Commissioner Abdul Rahim Jani said there were two stab
wounds on Sukumar's left rib cage and one each on his neck and left
chest.
	   He said there were also bruises on his hands which led police to
believe that there was a struggle prior to the stabbing believed to
have occurred last night.
	   Abdul Rahim said police were now trying to locate an Indonesian
security guard, Suhaiyanto Asan, 31, to assist in their
investigation.
	   Suhaiyanto was said to be on duty at the construction site when
the incident occurred.
	   Those knowing his whereabouts or having any information into the
incident are urged to contact the Selangor police headquarters at
tel: 03-5505522 or Petaling Jaya district police headquarters at
tel: 03-7562222.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The co-developer and main contractor for

<TEXT>
Vista Angkasa Block G low-cost flats gave an assurance today that
the project's physical works would be completed by the end of this
month.
	   Kien Sinar Sdn Bhd manager C.M. Wong said the physical works
included the fitting of electrical and sanitary equipment, doors
and window frames as well as the building of roads and drains.
	   He was responding to a Malay Mail report yesterday that
frustrated flat buyers were planning to seek the help of Deputy
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
	   They met on Sunday with a representative of City Hall and Lembah
Pantai Member of Parliament Datuk Shahrizat Abdul Jalil to discuss
the delay.
	   ``I don't deny that the project has been delayed and there are
various reasons for it. It is not financial problem,'' said Wong.
	   One reason was a request by buyers for balconies to be built up
to the eighth floor although the project was already 50 per cent
completed.
	   Wong said building the balconies required redesigning. It took
over a year and cost more than RM1 million.
	   He said the building of Block G started in 1992.
	   ``We have been working very closely with officials of City Hall
which is the co-developer of the project, through regular site
meetings. They are aware of the situation.''
	   He said delay was also caused by vandalism and theft of a main
electrical cable and control panels from the building's two lifts.
	   ``New panels have to be ordered from Japan. The lift contractors
have assured us that one lift will be in operation by next month
and the other in August.''
	   Although unable to state when the buyers would be able to move
in, Wong said: ``We will make an application for the certificate of
fitness as soon as the lifts are in order.''
	   At Sunday's meeting, the City Hall representative had assured
buyers that they could move into their flats by the end of the
year.
	   Another problem faced by Kien Sinar was a shortage of foreign
labour last year due to the repatriation of immigrant workers in
the construction industry and a shortage of materials.
	   The 14-storey Block G comprises 196 low-cost units priced at
RM25,000 each, which have been purchased by most of the tenants of
the adjacent Block 1A City Hall flats.
	   These buyers were former squatters of Kampung Kolam Air in Bukit
Kerinchi, who were relocated to City Hall flats in 1984.

	   THE Government yesterday approved the revised toll rates for the
Kuala Lumpur-Karak Highway effective June 15 and the annual RM14
million compensation it will have to pay the highway
concessionaire, MTD Prime Sdn Bhd.
	   Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, in announcing the new
toll rates at a press conference after attending the Cabinet
meeting in Kuala Lumpur, said there will be a 25 per cent and 30
per cent reduction in the rates for the Bentong and Gombak Toll
Plazas respectively from the rates announced by the Government on
May 14.
	   The Government had on May 15 announced a new set of toll rates
on the Kuala Lumpur-Karak Highway which would see rates going up as
high as RM6.60 but complaints from the highway users saw the
Government asking the Works Ministry to revise the rates.
	   Under the new rates, private cars and public buses will now have
to pay RM4.90 for using the Kuala Lumpur-Karak Highway, taxis
(RM2.50), six-axle vehicles (RM9.80), vehicles with more than six
axles (RM14.70). ``The toll rates is now the lowest compared with
other highways ... nine sen per km,''
	   he said, adding that highways built by Projek Lebuhraya
Utara-Selatan charge 10.5 sen per km. ``Now the toll rates have
been reasonably fixed, we hope that there will no longer be any
complaints,'' he said.
	   Asked if the Government plans to build more highways, Samy Vellu
said ``there will be no more toll plazas elsewhere''.
	   ``The more toll there is, the more costly it gets, and the more
people will have to pay for it.''
	   On the compensation, Samy Vellu said the Government has to
compensate the company as it will be facing losses following the
revision in the rates.
	   MTD Prime holds the concession to collect toll charges for 27
years, ending 2026. The company invested RM1.5 billion to upgrade
the present stretch.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The housing target of 800,000 units under

<TEXT>
the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), may not be achieved because
of the economic problems today, but the Government will try to
ensure that the low-and medium-cost sectors are not affected.
	   Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh
said it was fortunate that almost 950,000 housing units, over 90
per cent of them costing under RM150,000, were built in the last
two Malaysia Plans spanning 1986 to 1995.
	   ``Many were built to benefit low-income earners and the middle
class,'' he said before his Ministry's post-Cabinet meeting today.
	   The problem lay in the distribution of low-cost units, but this
was being tackled through the open registration and computerised
system.
	   He said the Seventh Plan's housing target may not be achieved,
especially in the premium sector as many developers have shelved
luxury housing projects.
	   ``We had feedback that several developers have postponed
launches of new projects and we are collating the data,'' he said.
	   However, as the Government had launched the RM2 billion credit
facility to build houses costing RM150,000 and below, this would
help ensure that the affordable housing sector was not jeopardised.
	   Of the total 948,388 units built during the Fifth and Sixth
Malaysia Plans, 425,782 were low-cost units (164,396 in 5MP and
261,386 in 6MP) and 399,218 were medium-cost (116,782 in 5MP and
282,436 in 6MP). A total of 19,750 luxury units were built in the
Fifth Plan and 103,638 in the Sixth.
	   The housing target for the Fifth plan was 701,500 but only
300,928 units or 43 per cent were built. None of the sector targets
were met.
	   However, the housing target of 573,000 for the Sixth Plan was
exceeded, with 647,460 units or 113 per cent having been built.
Only the low-cost housing target was not met.
	   On the National Economic Action Council's proposals and review
of the Indah Water Konsortium rates, he said both were under study.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd launched two events

<TEXT>
today to mark the symbolic 100-day countdown to the KL98 Games
which began last night.
	   The first was the launching of limited editions of prints of
sports images. Ten of Malaysia's artists have been invited to
submit a piece of work each depicting their individual
intepretations of the Commonwealth Games.
	   The chosen artists, all from different disciplines, are Redza
Piyadasa, Long Thien Shih, Raja Shahriman Azzidin, Khalil Ibrahim,
Ismail Hashim, William Harald-Wong, Juhari Muhammad Said, Yusoff
Idris, Alex Tan and Fatimah Chik.
	   Their works will be produced in limited edition, each numbered
and autographed individually. Only 350 sets of prints will be
produced.
	   The first edition set will be presented to Queen Elizabeth II of
Britain, who will officiate at the closing ceremony of the games.
An exhibition of the original works will be held while a set of
limited edition prints will be displayed at the main stadium in
Bukit Jalil throughout the Games.
	   Officiating today's launch at the company's headquarters in
Serdang was its chief operating officer Datuk Seri Abdul Manaf
Ibrahim.
	   The second event launched was an art competition for primary
schoolchildren entitled ``Kuala Lumpur 98 Sukan Komanwel XVI -
Malaysia Boleh''.
	   Organised by the company in collaboration with the Education
Ministry and Nestle Products Sdn Bhd, the competition will take
place on Aug 9 at the indoor stadium, National Sports Complex,
Bukit Jalil.
	   It is open to government and private primary schools in the
Klang Valley.
	   Deputy Education Minister and chef de mission of the Malaysian
Commonwealth Games contingent Datuk Khalid Yunus, who launched the
competition, said it was aimed at making children aware of the
Games.
	   ``With the Games drawing closer we would like to build up
excitement and anticipation throughout the nation. Everyone's
involvement in the Games is valued, including children's.''
	   Datin Seri Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, the wife of Prime Minister

	   SOUTHERN Bank Bhd (SBB) is expected to continue to be profitable
this year on a moderate growth, despite the current economic
slowdown.
	   SBB's total non-performing loans (NPL) arecurrently well below
the industry's average, with the bank's NPL at 5 per cent while the
group's NPL at 7.4 per cent as at March this year.
	   SBB's chief executive officer Datuk Tan Teong Hean said this to
reporters after the bank's annual general meeting yesterday.
	   According to Tan, with a strong balance sheet, SBB is
sufficiently capitalised with a risk weighted capital adequacy
ratio (RWCR) of 20.3 per cent.
	   At 20.3 per cent and 23.9 per cent RWCR for the bank and finance
company, Southern Finance Company Bhd respectively, it is far
superior to the Malaysian industry average of 10.6 per cent and the
minimum capital of 8 per cent under international banking
standards.
	   The bank's NPL is expected to fluctuate in tandem with the gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of the country.
	   As this year will be very challenging, Tan said that SBB will
adopt measures on reducing costs and improve productivity by being
information technology (IT) driven to by-pass traditional banking
channels.
	   In an economy that is increasingly wired, digital and
borderless, the bank's real strength and much of its market success
is due not wholly to capital intensity.
	   It is also attributable to continuing strategic responses and by
the timely adoption of technologies that render the market place
increasingly time and geography neutral.
	   He added the bank has for some time now been investing in IT and
will be targeting its computer literate customers especially in
direct banking.
	   On the possibility of the bank selling off its less profitable
assets, Tan said that SBB is not expected to dispose any of the
group's assets.
	   As for SSB's amalgamation with Southern Finance, Tan said the
exercise is expected to be completed by end of the year.
	   The amalgamation will have a positive effect on the financial
position of the bank and further strengthen the bank's already
strong RWCR currently standing at 20.3 per cent.
	   It will also provide an opportunity to review and reshape the
group's business in the loan markets.
	   SBB group pre-tax profit fell 29.7 per cent to RM122.2 million
for the year just ended, total loans and advances for the group
rose 20.6 per cent to RM5.4 billion. Total deposits grew 19.3 per
cent to RM6.7 billion.

Hartwig breaks American Record in pole vault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France (AP) - Jeff Hartwig set a American pole vault
record Thursday, bettering 6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1/4 inches) at a
the St. Denis international track meet.
	   Hartwig bettered the previous mark of 5.98 meters (19-7 1/2) set
in May. 1996 by Lawrence Johnson.
	   Harwig, a 30-year-old from Arkansas State, had a good series,
starting at 5.55 and then clearing 5.70 meters, 5.8 and 5.9 on his
second attempt.
	   He missed twice at 6.00 then went over on his third attempt,
hitting the bar on his way over.
	   Hartwig's last year was 5.85. although he did 5.86 indoors this
year.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who took over the crown as the
top middle distance runner in the world last year, won the 1,500
meters Thursday at the St. Denis international athletics meeting.
	   El Guerrouj's time, 3 minutes, 32.34 seconds, was far from his
best. He had four races under 3:30 last year.
	   However it was just his second race of the season. He did
3:31.18 but it was overshadowed Monday by a world record in the
10,000 by Haile Gebrselassie
	   The 24-year-old El Guerrouj was known for his fall entering the
final lap at the Atlanta Olympics 1,500 giving the title to
Noureddine Morceli, who had dominated the distance for nearly 6
years.
	   In 1997 El Guerrouj finally overtook Morceli, taking the world
championship and being unbeaten for the season and setting world
records at two distances indoor.
	   El Guerrouj has sparked a running revival in Morocco, where Said
Aouita ruled in the mid 1980s. Moroccan women took the 800 and
5,000 o Thursday.
	   Hasna Benhassi took the women's 800 in 1:59.71, the first time
under 2:00 for the 20-year-old.
	   Two-time world cross-country champion Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland was soundly beaten in her 5,000 race, coming in third
behind Zohra Ouaziz of Morocco and Gete Wami of Ethiopia.
	   O'Sullivan won both the long and short distance races in a
double at the world cross country meet in Morocco in March.
	   ``It's still the beginning of the season,'' O'Sullican said. ``I
want to do the 1,500. My goal is to win the Europeans in Budapest.
The other competitions are just practice races.''
	   Ouaziz ran a season best 14:42.11 with O'Sullivan doing 15:03.76
	   Ouaziz found the conditions tough.
	   ``I had problems with the windy weather,'' Ouaziz said. ``I was
afraid to take off. It's a pity. We both could have gone under
14:40.
	   Christine Aaron of France, fresh from a 10.95 last week,
confirmed her timing with a 10.99 victory.
	   Former world champion Samuel Matete of Zambia took the 400
hurdles in 48.90. He found the conditions difficult.
	   ``It went well but there's a lot of wind,'' Matete said. ``Te
time wasn't brilliant. I've done 48.32.''
	   The women's 400 hurdles went to Olympic champion Deon Hemmings
of Jamaica, 54.21, beating 1995 world champion Kim Batten of the
United States,

Scientists develop tiny lasers that could speed up computers,
</HEADLINE>
communications  
  By BRIGITTE GREENBERG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ A team of scientists has developed
tiny lasers that are 1,000 times more powerful than conventional
ones, bringing researchers a step closer to creating faster
computers and telecommunications equipment.
	   The experimental microlasers could be used in the future to
speed up voice, video, Internet and other forms of communication
that use fiber-optic networks, or the lasers could become the basis
for entirely new networks, researchers say.
	   The discovery was to be published in Friday's edition of the
journal Science.
	   The microlasers were developed by scientists from Yale
University, Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New
Jersey, and the Max Planck Institute of Physics in Dresden,
Germany.
	   Bill Diamond, marketing director for Lucent's Optoelectronics
group, said the company, which builds communications systems, may
try to market the new technology.
	   ``Breakthrough innovations like these new lasers are of
tremendous importance to us for their potential use in high-speed
communications,'' he said.
	   Microlasers, which are about as wide as a human hair, could
allow manufacturers to build computers that would use light instead
of electrons in some parts, replacing selected electronic
components, such as wiring, with fiber-optics, which use light.
	   ``Light moves faster than electrical current,'' said Yale
physicist A. Douglas Stone. ``Light carries signals at the speed of
light, which is the fastest things can go.''
	   What makes these lasers different from those currently in use is
how the researchers managed to capture, control and transmit the
light beams. In the past, scientists had done this inside a
perfectly round cylinder. The downside was that the light beams
were not too powerful and were difficult to control.
	   Stone proposed changing the shape to more of an oval or
egg-shape.
	   ``If it's a circular cylinder, a lot of (the laser beam) gets
wasted and doesn't get out at all,'' Stone said. ``A lot of light
was lost. I had the idea, 'Why don't you deform it, so that it's
not a perfect cylinder?' I conjectured that it would move faster
and in preferred directions.''
	   That's exactly what happened. The result was a crisscrossing bow
tie pattern of light that bounces around inside the egg-shaped
cylinder, giving the laser more power. Each laser is comprised of
four small, more easily controlled beams.
	   Stone said the modification results in an enormous increase in
power, with the laser producing a total of 40 milliwatts compared
to 40 microwatts in the round cylinder.
	   Cherry Murray, director of the Bell Labs Physical Research Lab,
said until now, researchers didn't know the powerful possibilities
of lasers.
	   ``Nobody realized before there was a really simple way to get a
large amount of power out of these tiny lasers,'' Murray said.
``This is certainly in the research stages. We're not looking for a
product in the near future, but what is neat about this bow tie
mode is that you can make very tiny lasers. The bowtie mode allows
you to get high power out.''
	   David Miller, professor of electrical engineering at Stanford
University, said the discovery holds promise.
	   ``The idea of replacing wires with optical connections is an
interesting idea. If we look out toward the next decade, we ought
to be thinking about it seriously,'' Miller said. ``Basically, the
wiring can't keep up. That's a problem that electrical wiring has.
It's a very interesting solution.''
	   The change is important because manufacturers are always looking
for ways to speed up computers and communications equipment and
make the components smaller.
	   ``Bit by bit, we've been replacing electrical currents with
beams of light in fibers,'' Stone said. ``An optical fiber can
carry thousands more bits of information than coaxial cable.''

ran out today. Eleven wet markets and supermarkets under the
Wise-Spending index had none for sale.
	   Banana was also scarce four days ago, available only at the Pudu
and Subang Jaya wet markets - for RM1.80 and RM1.70 per kilogramme
respectively.
	   On the other hand, ikan kembung was abundant, selling at between
RM4 and RM8 per kg, at a similar price range noted last week.
	   The fish was most expensive at the Lucky Garden wet market and
cheapest at the Chow Kit wet market.
	   In Penang, ikan kembung was sold for between RM3.30 per kg and
RM8 per kg with the best bargain at Sui Wah Sunshine Square
supermarket in Penang.

at RM4.40 per kg.
	   Price of red chillies remained stable, at between RM13 per kg
and RM19 per kg at both the wet markets and supermarkets.
	   Small onions sold for between RM2.50 per kg and RM4.80 per kg
with the best buy at Super Komtar supermarket.
	   In Ipoh, prices of goods remained generally stable at wet
markets and supermarkets today. But some items chalked increases of
between RM2 and RM3 from the previous week.
	   Red chillies, for example, were selling for RM17 per kg at
Central and RM18 per kg at Canning Garden compared with RM15 per kg
and RM16 per kg respectively previously.
	   However, the price of ikan kembung remained unchanged at RM6 per
kg at Central and Buntong and RM7.50 per kg at Canning Garden.
	   Dressed chicken price was also unchanged at wet markets, selling
for RM5.40 per kg at Central and Buntong and RM4.50 per kg at
Canning Garden.
	   In Johor Baru, the price of red chillies shot up to as high as
RM17.50 at Tops supermarket.
	   Imported beef sold at Carrefour carried a price tag of RM16.90
per kg, compared to RM6.90 per kg at Tops and RM9.00 per kg at the
wet markets.
	   The price of other essential items however remained stable.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Leaded petrol will be phased out by January

<TEXT>
next year nationwide with the introduction of unleaded petrol 92
RON to replace the existing premium leaded 92 RON and unleaded 97
RON.
	   This means there will only be one grade of unleaded petrol for
sale compared to the two-grade petrol structure implemented since
early 1995, where there was one grade each of leaded and unleaded
petrol.
	   The retail price of the petrol would be the same.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayob said the small segment of the market which uses
leaded petrol would be able to use premium unleaded 92 RON where
the lead content was lower.
	   ``There will be no harm in switching from the previous leaded to
unleaded 92 RON. This is in line with the Government's efforts to
ensure a cleaner environment,'' he said.
	   RON (Research Octane Number) defines the octane level of the
fuel.
	   Megat Junid said at present, the benzene content in RON 92
leaded is 0.7 per cent per litre while for Ron 92 unleaded is 0.6
per cent.
	   The ministry, he said was identifying the main users of leaded
petrol and are holding discussions with petrol companies to find
out if any problem would arise as a result of stopping the sale of
leaded petrol.
	   ``Most of the major petrol companies had agreed to stop selling
leaded petrol following a dialogue with the ministry,'' he said.
	   Last year, leaded petrol sales dropped to 1.1 million litres
compared to unleaded petrol sales of more than five million litres.
	   The Government, he said had decided to do away with the existing
leaded petrol as the demand for it was low.
	   In another development, Megat Junid said there was an average 21
per cent increase in the prices of various domestic rice and 51 per
cent price increase for imported rice since May.
	   He said the current dry spell and poor rainfall had affected the
production of rice this year, resulting in the price increase.

Hints of movement in long-stalled Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS throughout with Arafat, Netanyahu saying there are
signs of progress, ADDS statement from religious lawmakers, Changes
byline. No pickup.  
  By HILARY APPELMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The long-stalled Mideast peace proces showed
signs of movement Thursday, with hopeful assessments from both
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   American officials, who have expressed impatience with Israel in
recent weeks, expect a decision from Netanyahu within days on a
U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
The Palestinians have already accepted the plan, which has yet to
be made public.
	   ``There has been some progress in the direction of an agreement
that will be good for all sides,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Jerusalem. ``But I can't tell you what or when until it is
completed.''
	   Asked if there would be a withdrawal soon, Arafat, returning to
the Gaza Strip on Thursday night from a trip to Jordan and Yemen,
said, ``I hope so.''
	   Arafat said the Americans had promised that ``everything will be
complete'' no later than mid-June.
	   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Thursday published what it said
was the complete U.S. initiative. The report said a total of 40
percent of the West Bank would come under Palestinian control, and
Israel would agree not to expand Jewish settlements.
	   Details of the plan have been reported in the past, but the
Haaretz report was the first to give its full scope.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour confirmed the points
reported by Haaretz. A U.S. official, however, said on condition of
anonymity the plan as printed was not accurate, and Netanyahu said
it was ``simply not up to date.''
	   It was not immediately clear who leaked the plan. Netanyahu
might have done it to test public opinion. A majority of Israelis
want the prime minister to forge ahead with the peace process, but
far right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his
government over a troop pullback.
	   U.S. of Palestinian officials also may have leaked the plan to
pressure Israel to take action.
	   With signs that a deal could be near, all sides were jockeying
for position Thursday.
	   The Land of Israel Front, a group of right-wing legislators that
has threatened to bring down Netanyahu's government if he agrees to
a withdrawal, said Thursday it would reconsider its plans if
Netanyahu agreed to a referendum before carrying out any pullout.
	   Earlier in the week, the National Religious Party, part of
Netanyahu's coalition, said it would vote against any withdrawal
but would not vote to bring the government down.
	   Under the reported plan, Israel would withdraw troops in three
stages over 12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control
over 3 percent of the West Bank and partial control over 24
percent. According to Haaretz, the U.S. plan would leave them with
full control over 18.2 percent and partial control over 22 percent,
for a total of 40 percent _ a possible springboard for statehood.
	   Talks on a permanent peace accord would begin immediately with
the first troop pullback.
	   In the agreement, Israel promises not to expand Jewish
settlements in a significant way, says it will refrain from
demolishing 1,800 Palestinian homes currently slated for
construction and restricts land confiscations.
	   In another nod to the Palestinians, sections of the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction will be annulled by vote
of the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather than the much
larger Palestine National Council, as demanded by Israel.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, will not question Israeli
credentials at the United Nations, and Arafat will outlaw
incitement against Israel and systematically confiscate illegal
weapons.
	   A trilateral committee will meet every two weeks to discuss
security matters, and an American-Palestinian committee will follow
up on the cases of suspected Palestinian militants. Israel has
complained that Arafat often arrests Islamic militants for show and
then quickly releases them.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper said Netanyahu had embraced most of
the Amerian proposals, including the 13 percent troop pullback, and
that the key sticking point now was the scope of an additional
withdrawal. Netanyahu wants to limit that pullback to 2 percent,
but the Palestinians said they expected a more generous offer.

Norwegian squad arrives in France amid strict security

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ Norway, which has one of the best warmup
records of all teams heading to the World Cup, arrived at its final
training camp Thursday primed for its Group A opener against
Morocco.
	   More than a dozen police from the Gendarmerie guarded the hotel
entrance at Saint-Andre-des-Eaux in northwest France hours before
the Norwegian team bus, escorted by several police on motorcycles,
arrived in the evening from Nantes airport.
	   Guards did not allow photographers or reporters near the hotel,
which is situated next to a golf course and is off-limits to the
media according to FIFA rules.
	   ``I'm delighted to be here,'' said Ronny Johnsen after the
team's chartered airliner landed in Nantes. ``I'm healthy and
looking forward to a long championship.''
	   Johnsen, a central defender, just missed a spot on the roster
four years ago in the United States, but now is one of Norway's key
players.
	   Head coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen, who has led Norway to its
second straight World Cup finals, didn't travel with the squad to
the hotel. He will arrive Friday after watching the Morocco-Chile
warmup Thursday night in Montelimar, France.
	   Norway faces Morocco on June 10 in Montpellier, the second match
of the World Cup. Defending champion Brazil and Scotland, the other
Group A teams, play the opening game earlier that day at the new
Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, just outside Paris.
	   The Norwegians, who scored only one goal in the first round four
years ago and failed to advance, outscored opponents 13-2 in their
last three warmup games.
	   But Olsen wasn't satisfied after the last victory May 27 at
home, a 6-0 rout of Saudi Arabia, another World Cup team.
	   ``The game was over when the Saudis had their second player sent
off 10 minutes before the break,'' Olsen said. ``It's very unusual
to play against a team with only nine players.''
	   Norway, which finished its qualifying campaign unbeaten, didn't
lose any of its exhibitions against four other World Cup teams this
spring. After starting with a pair of draws against France (3-3)
and Belgium (2-2) on the road, the Norwegians blanked Denmark 2-0
for its first away win in Copenhagen in 27 years and then beat
Mexico 5-2.

holders have been offered places in Form Six this year, an increase
of 54.8 per cent over last year.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak attributed the
sharp increase to the larger number of students opting to study in
the country and better SPM results this year. He said that schools
could take all eligible students.
	   Form Six classes started on Monday.
	   Najib said State education departments had made the necessary
arrangements to provide places for students by opening up
additional classes and recruiting more teachers.
	   ``Classes are available at schools which previously did not
offer Form Six. Some schools have also made adjustments to their
time-tables to accommodate the larger number of students,'' Najib
said after his post-Cabinet meeting today.
	   He said of the 42,584 students, 56.4 per cent or 24,012
students, were in the Science stream, and 43.6 per cent or 18,572
students, were in the Arts stream.
	   ``Not all students offered places will turn up. Some have
started working while others enrolled in polytechnics.''
	   Of the 304,475 students who sat for the SPM last year, 66,220
scored Grade One, 63,685 Grade Two and 48,326 Grade Three.
	   Some 41,290 SPM holders had been offered places to study
matriculation, diploma and degree courses at public universities.
	   Najib said schools received the list of eligible students from
the various State education departments on Monday.
	   ``Students who had not received their offer letters can check
their status at their former schools.''
	   He said those eligible for Form Six must pass the SPM/V
examination with at least three credits, including Bahasa Malaysia,
and must be between 17 and 20 years old on Jan 1 this year.
	   ``For the Arts stream, students must have an aggregate of not
more than eight for three of their best subjects, with each subject
from a different category (The Arts stream has nine subject
categories).
	   ``For the Science stream, students must have at least three
credits, with an aggregate of less than 18 for three of their best
Science subjects, with each subject from a different category (The
Science stream has five subject categories).''
	   Najib said those who did not succeed in securing places could
appeal to the respective education departments by July 1. ``Appeal
forms are available from schools.''
	   He said students with aggregates between nine and 12 for three
of their best subjects from different subject categories would be
considered for places in the Arts stream.
	   Students who took Science subjects and obtained excellent
results for the SPM/V, but did not get a credit for Bahasa
Malaysia, will be considered for places in the Science stream if
they obtain an aggregate of not more than 10 for three of their
best Science subjects from different categories and pass their
Bahasa Malaysia paper.
	   ``However, they have to sit for the July 1998 Bahasa Malaysia
paper and obtain a credit to be eligible for places in Upper Six
next year.''
	   Najib said private candidates who wanted to complete Form Six at
government schools would be considered only if there were
sufficient places.
	   On ``3+0'' programmes (foreign degree courses conducted entirely
in Malaysia), Najib said none of the private colleges which applied
to run such courses had been given approval.

holders, who had appealed after they failed to obtain places to
study matriculation, diploma and degree courses at the public
universities, have now been offered places in these courses.
	   The Education Ministry's director of higher education Professor
Hassan Said said notification letters were being sent to the
successful candidates from today.
	   ``Students in Kuala Lumpur will receive theirs in a few days,
while those in Sabah and Sarawak may have to wait longer,'' Hassan
said.
	   A total of 2,800 SPM and SPMV holders had appealed to the Unit
Pusat Universiti after failing to secure places at local public
universities.
	   Another 1,000 students were ``left out'' despite good results
because of computer errors or mistakes in their applications.
Hassan had said their forms would be checked by the UPU against the
database of results from the Examination Syndicate.
	   Students who do not receive the notification by June 15 will
have to accept that their appeals have been unsuccessful. This also
applies to the ``left out'' students.
	   ``Students have to wait for their letters. There is no need for
them to check the status of their appeals at the UPU.''
	   The majority of SPM and SPMV holders involved had applied for
matriculation courses. The others had applied for degree courses at
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Institut Tun Hussein Onn, as well
as diploma courses.

THE courts will not do away with Chinese interpreters as long as

<TEXT>
there is a need for their service.
	   ``The Government wants all parties to have the right to seek
justice. As such, interpreters are crucial to avoid
misinterpretation and use of confusing words,'' Deputy Minister in
the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Mohamed Nazri Aziz said.
	   Replying to a supplementary question from Senator Rosli Mat
Hassan, Mohamed Nazri said total use of Bahasa Malaysia in courts
was achievable provided courts in Sabah and Sarawak used it widely.
	   He said there was a shortage of Chinese court interpreters
especially in Kuala Lumpur since half of the 250 posts created was
still vacant.

LIKE MMX technology, accelerated graphics port (AGP) will become

<TEXT>
important down the road. Using the AGP connection, the graphics
chip can access system memory directly through the system chipset
at memory-bus speeds, reducing latency and increasing performance
compared with peripheral component interconnect (PCI) transfers.
Doing so removes the burden of graphics throughput from the PCI
bus.
	   With AGP, software developers have more graphics bandwidth to
work with, and future applications will certainly require AGP.
	   While most major vendors have announced AGP-compliant solutions,
a few mainstream graphics chip vendors such as S3 say they will
wait until Windows 98 is out to fully support AGP.
	   By then, Pentium II systems are also expected to be more
prevalent.
	   Software applications have yet to take advantage of AGP.
	   Asustek's associate vice president for research and development
H.C.
	   Hung says that today many AGP graphics boards show minimal
performance gains over PCI offerings. ``Our test result shows that
only 350MHz and up Pentium II processor with the Intel 440BX chip
set can bring the AGP performance into full play,'' he adds.
	   More recently, there is an ongoing debate about enhancing
performance by adding AGP or a larger frame-buffer memory.
	   As AGP uses part of the existing system memory for MIPS-mapping
textures, one of its advantage is that it should require less
memory on a graphics card for a less expensive solution.
	   However, many makers agree that the cost of adding an AGP
graphics accelerator is still less than adding an additional four
megabytes of local graphics memory.

	   THE Government has provided a RM300 million soft loan to KL PRT
Sdn Bhd to assist the concessionaire to complete the construction
of the monorail project in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Government has also given the nod to KL PRT to raise capital
for the project through an initial public offer (IPO).
	   Announcing these in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, Transport Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said the Government decided on such a
move about a month ago.
	   ``We decided to allow KL PRT to implement an IPO on
infrastructure where it can raise capital for the project.
	   ``Apart from this, the Government also decided to provide a soft
loan to the concessionaire.
	   ``So, there are two ways for KL PRT to finance the monorail
project,'' he told newsmen prior to the ministry's post-Cabinet
meeting.
	   Dr Ling was asked on the progress of the monorail project which
was said to be on a standstill and abandoned because of cash
problem faced by the concessionaire.
	   Last February, KL PRT clarified that the project was not
abandoned but did not dismiss the possibility that the project
would not be ready for the Commonwealth Games which was scheduled
to be held in September.
	   Earlier reports said the project had been abandoned since
December.
	   Commenting on this, Dr Ling said: ``As far I know, KL PRT has
already started the project.''
	   The RM1.9 billion project was scheduled to be completed by
September this year to complement public transportation for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   When completed, the monorail project will provide public
transport to the central business, hotel and shopping district. It
will have 21 stations.
	   Noting that the cost of financing the monorail project will be
reduced significantly from now, Dr Ling said KL PRT is also looking
at the possibility of developing local technology for the project.
	   ``There have been other proposals such as that we will try to
develop local technology by borrowing the technology from abroad
and adapt it for local use.
	   ``In future, we can also export the local technology in the
region,'' he said, adding the US is one of the countries identified
as the source for technology.
	   On the proposed amendment to the Transport Act, with the view to
introduce mandatory jail sentence on motorists who drive or ride
their vehicles recklessly and caused fatality, Dr Ling said the
ministry is still studying the proposals submitted by a special
committee set up to study the proposed amendment.
	   ``We are studying the recommendations before presenting them to
the Cabinet. We hope the proposals will be ready before the next
Parliament session.
	   ``However, this does not mean that the proposed introduction of
such mandatory jail sentence will have to go through Parliament.
	   ``If we find that there is no need for us to table the proposals
in Parliament, then we will implement it using the existing
provisions as stipulated under the Act,'' he added.
	   On the progress of the KL International Airport in Sepang, Dr
Ling said he will be visiting the new airport today.
	   ``I will be given a briefing on the progress during my visit to
the airport. I hope to be able to provide the press a clearer
picture of the progress after the briefing,'' he added.

Euro nations launch economic policy council
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with meeting starting, EU Commission requesting more
deficit cuts; Brown leaving; TRIMS  
  By PAUL AMES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union took another step toward
making its
	   single currency a reality Thursday when finance ministers from
11 nations launched a new body to coordinate economic policy in the
euro era.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said those 11
nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1
should cut budget deficits more than forecast, to take account of
Europe's quickening economic recovery.
	   ``Reductions in public deficits should reflect that favorable
development,'' de Silguy told reporters on the margin of the
meeting in a chateau outside Luxembourg.
	   He said the 11 euro nations should aim for an average deficit of
2 percent of gross domestic product this year and 1.5 percent of
GDP in 1999. That compares to current forecasts of 2.4 percent in
1998 and 2 percent for next year.
	   De Silguy's aides said the deficit cuts could be made without
further budgetary belt-tightening since increased growth would
bring in higher-than-expected revenues.
	   ``All this is in the realm of the possible,'' de Silguy said. In
a first reaction, Spanish Economics Minister Rodrigo Rato said
Spain's deficit would be lower than forecast.
	   The evening meeting was the first for the so-called ``euro-11''
council which was set up tighten consultations between the 11
nations in the first group to switch to the euro.
	   In December, EU leaders agreed to create such a body after
months of wrangling. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece _ which
are staying out of the single currency for now _ tried to block the
setting up of the council, fearing it would exclude them from key
economic decisions.
	   Germany was concerned the council _ first suggested by France _
could be used to undermine the independence of the European Central
Bank which is to run monetary policy after the switch to the euro.
	   Although the compromise which eventually set up the euro-11 does
not give
	   it formal decision-making powers, France is expected to push for
it to develop into an important forum for coordinating polices on
taxation, budgets and other economic issues.
	   Although left out of the main workings of the euro-11, ministers
from the other EU nations will be invited to attend some sessions.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown briefly
addressed the opening meeting, since his country currently holds
the EU's rotating presidency.
	   But he left after about 90 minutes, handing the chair to
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger. Austria takes over the
presidency from Britain on July 1.
	   Britain's exclusion left Brown open to criticism from opposition
lawmakers.
	   ``This is a humiliating position,'' said Graham Mather,
Conservative spokesman on European economics. ``The Labor
government (has) proved incapable of negotiating effectively in the
EU arena.''
	   On Friday in Luxembourg, Brown will chair a full session of the
15 EU finance ministers.

	   THE Finance Ministry has received 30 enquiries on tax exemptions
for overseas earnings remitted into the country since the
announcement on the liberalisation was made last month.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Wong See Wah said there was one
enquiry from a person wanting to bring back RM20 million to
Malaysia, while the others are between RM500,000 and RM1 million.
	   ``We have told these individuals to liaise with the Inland
Revenue Board (IRB) on the proper procedures of remitting their
money into the country so that these earnings would be exempted
from tax,'' he told reporters after launching the board's new logo
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Wong said these individuals should submit their applications for
tax exemption to the IRB's Tax Analysis Division after the money
had been remitted into their respective bank accounts in the
country.
	   ``Besides their personal particulars, they should also furnish
the Division with documents to prove remittance. When tax exemption
had been granted, they were not required to declare the money they
had brought back, in the income tax form submitted to the IRB.''
	   Wong said however, this tax exemption will only be granted for
money remitted from overseas between May 20 and December 31, this
year, adding that the Government will not investigate the sources
of the money brought back into the country.

BREATHING is the most basic function for human beings and it is

<TEXT>
one of the most fundamental life processes.
	   We are conscious of the vital role the breath of life plays in
one's healthy existence, physically, mentally and emotionally.
	   We breathe 21,600 times per day at the average of 15 times per
minute.
	   If we try to visualise the breathing mechanism we can see how
severely postural deviations affect breathing.
	   The curved spinal column of a rounded back restricts the
breathing space. A spinal column bent to the side pushes the ribs
out on one side but pulls them in on the other and impairs
breathing significantly.
	   Different cultures have designed their own techniques to enhance
the value of breathing.
	   The best, healthiest and least forced form of training in proper
breathing is singing.
	   In the practice of yoga, the therapeutic sound of aum is used to
restore one's health.
	   The sound of aum is the most natural sound in the world. Its
vibrations are beneficial to the health by purifying the body and
by disciplining the mind.
	   The benefits of the usage of the therapeutic sound of aum is
sufficient to restore one's health and strengthen the lungs by
conditioning one to do deep slow rhythmic breathing.
	   The body is energised and so is the neuro-endocrine system,
which is the most important of all bodily systems.
	   The sound aum progressively slows down all the bodily processes,
relaxes the body, stills the mind and neutralises physical, mental
and emotional tension.
	   It slowly but surely cultivates the ability to focus, and
arising from it, harmonises the bodily systems and integrates both
body and mind.
	   If practised daily for 81 days with other yogic practices based
on deep, slow and rhythmic breathing, it would help patients with
stress-related and immune system deficient diseases, and one is
able to regain lost health by one's own sustained effort.
	   Vibrational breath therapy is a simple technique which can be
learned by those who have the discipline to practice.
	   To begin the practice, face north and sit on the heels. Keep the
hands on the thighs with the fingers on the inside and take a deep
breath from the abdominal area and then the chest and high chest.
	   This deep breath is taken in through the nose and then exhaled
slowly and deeply through the mouth with the aum sound.
	   The aum sound is made up of three vibratory sounds - ``A'',
``U'', and ``M''.
	   The sound ``Ah'' is a guttural sound which must begin in the
solar plexus and is the lowest sound that can be produced by the
human.
	   The exhalation is continued to the next sound which is the `ooh'
sound.
	   This sound emanates from the back of the throat, then along the
tongue as a palatal sound and then continues forward against the
teeth as a dental sound and finally as a labial sound at the lips.
	   The final sound is the ``mmm''. It evolves upwards into the nose
as a nasal vibration. This is repeated several times, working up to
one and a half hours per day.
	   Let this practice be a real ``meditative and contemplative
activity''.
	   Experiment with it and feel the vibrations rising through the
body in all the tissues and the organs as the sound passes along
the path.

IPOH, Wed. - The Perak Consumers Association wants the Human

<TEXT>
Resources Ministry and Bank Negara to investigate how 69 employees
of Ganda Edible Oil Bhd received loans for the purchase of shares
although they were not qualified.
	   The employees were offered the shares under the company's
Employees Share Option Scheme.
	   Association president Abdul Rahman Said Alli said Human
Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek should look into the plight of
these workers who are now facing problems with the finance company
which had demanded that they settle their loans within two weeks.
	   He said Bank Negara should also check with the finance company
whether proper procedures were followed when giving out loans to
workers who ``do not have the means to purchase the shares.''
	   Abdul Rahman said he was puzzled as to how the finance company
could approve loans to the workers for the purchase of between
5,000 and 60,000 lots of Westland shares, each at RM4,216 per lot,
when they were only earning an average of RM800 per month.
	   Ganda Edible Oil in Teluk Intan is the subsidiary of Westmont
Land (Asia) Berhad.
	   According to Abdul Rahman, Westmont Land (Asia) Berhad had sent
out offer letters in July 1996 to the 69 employees to join its
Employees Share Option Scheme.
	   The employees had been offered a total of 724,000 lots with
loans amounting to RM3.04 million. The share was traded at 52.5 sen
per unit yesterday.
	   Abdul Rahman said the association was approached by several
workers when they received letters from the finance company asking
them to settle the loans.
	   He said after the offer had been made in July 1996, the workers
had declined as they could not afford the shares.
	   However, the workers claimed that the management coerced them
into buying, claiming that they could exercise it over a period of
five years and could also sell the shares to outsiders.
	   When the workers told the employers that they did not have the
money to buy the shares, the employers said they would arrange with
a local finance company for a ``revolving loan'' to purchase and
sell the shares.
	   He said the workers, however, could not pay the interest and
after six months, the finance company sold off two lots per person
to recover the interest.
	   Abdul Rahman said the workers were worried as the finance
company would be taking legal action and had threatened to
repossess their houses and vehicles.
	   The company management however was not available for comment.

KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Government has agreed to give a RM300

<TEXT>
million soft loan to KL-PRT Sdn Bhd, the concessionaire for the
monorail system in Kuala Lumpur, to enable it to continue the
project, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said
today.
	   Besides this loan facility, the Government has also given the
company the green light to raise funds through a public rights
issue. ``The decision was made about a month ago. The company is
seeking the approval of the Securities Commission,'' Dr Ling told
reporters before the weekly post-Cabinet briefing.
	   It was reported that the company had to review its construction
programme and work out a new financial arrangement in view of the
economic situation.
	   The RM2.2 billion, 16km-long project started in March last year
and so far, work has been completed in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman,
Jalan Sultan Ismail, Jalan Imbi, Jalan Hang Tuah, Jalan
Maharajalela and Jalan Sultan Sulaiman.
	   The monorail is to run along several of the busiest roads in the
city and will complement the public transportation for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Dr Ling said the company had also informed the authorities that
the American technology used in the construction would be adopted
locally.
	   ``With the experience gained from the project, the company can,
in future, undertake similar projects overseas,'' he added.

	   CYGAL Bhd, in reply to a Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange query, said
the High Court of Kuala Lumpur is to decide on the company's
application to set aside the winding-up petition filed by Syarikat
Lian Ping Enterprise Sdn Bhd against Cygal next Tuesday.
	   No date has been fixed to hear the winding-up petition itself
which involves RM3.22 million purportedly due to Syarikat Lian Ping
under certain interim certificates by Cygal.
	   Cygal is undertaking the construction of Grand Bluewave Hotel in
Johor Baru for the developer of the project. Syarikat Lian Ping was
the developer's nominated subcontractor (NSC) for certain interior
design works.
	   Cygal disputes the quantum claimed by the petitioner, and it
said any dispute under the NSC contract has to be referred for
arbitration.
	   In view of the hearing on June 9, Cygal has requested a further
suspension in the trading of its shares.

	   AT SIX weeks, Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore is one of Kuala Lumpur's
newest Italian restaurants.
	   Located at Megan Phileo Promenade in Jalan Tun Razak, the
restaurant belongs to a chain of five other Pasta Fresca
restaurants (plus one pasta factory which manufactures and supplies
the five outlets with pasta) in Singapore and four others in
Shanghai, China.
	   The first Pasta Fresca Restaurant opened in Singapore in 1988.
	   Why did it take its owner, Salvatore Carecci, that long to set
up operations here?
	   ``The company here is actually three years old,'' Carecci, the
managing director of Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore, said.
	   ``We were looking for the right location, and then we had to
wait for the building to be completed before we moved in,'' he told
Business Times.
	   And does he feel he has made the right choice with Malaysia
especially since the economy is not doing too well?
	   ``Of course. I believe in this place,'' he said. ``It will take
a while before people start to know about Pasta Fresca, but then
that is what business is all about.''
	   The economic slowdown, he noted, is not just affecting Malaysia
but many other countries in the region as well.
	   This, however, has not stopped diners from trying out the
restaurant.
	   Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore opens daily, except Sunday, for lunch
and dinner.
	   As the newest Italian ``kid on the block'', how does Carecci
view the competition from other similar, more established
restaurants here?
	   ``What competition? We make our pastas fresh. If Malaysians want
to eat fresh pasta, they will have to come to Pasta Fresca,'' he
said.
	   Diners at his restaurant get to see the pasta they order made
fresh from pasta machines located next to the dining area.
	   Asked if he is thinking of expanding further in Malaysia, he
said ``slowly, slowly ... this is just the beginning for us. We
will see where we go from here.''
	   Carecci spends a week in Shanghai every month and will travel up
to Kuala Lumpur every fortnight for between two and three days.
	   With all his globetrotting between China, Singapore and now
Malaysia, Carecci leaves the day-to-day running of his restaurant
in the safe and capable hands of his restaurant manager, Campana
Luca Simone and his chef, Cappa Mirko.
	   Mirko has been working at Pasta Fresca for close to three years.
He trains the local chefs wherever a new restaurant springs up,
which can take anything from three to four months.
	   Economic slowdown or not, diners thronged Pasta Fresca Da
Salvatore for lunch and dinner. A woman diner said she lunches
there almost every day.
	   ``Not necessarily pasta and pizza every day as ``there's so much
else to order and sample here. The breads and soups are delicious,
so are the main courses,'' she said.
	   This is exactly the kind of talk that the affable, stocky
entrepreneur is counting on to spread the word around on his
establishment. ``The best form of advertising is through the word
of mouth,'' he added.
	   And Carecci tells diners to treat the restaurant like their
house. ``They are welcome to make themselves feel at home here.''
	   The restaurant may look like any other Italian eatery - the
music, Tuscany pictures, red brick walls and terracotta floor tiles
- but it is Carecci's strong people-skills and genuine like for
people that sets Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore apart from the others.

IN the fast-paced, ultra-competitive world of information

<TEXT>
technology (IT), where technologies and stock prices shift and
change at breakneck speed, it is becoming increasingly tempting to
view IT as a winner-takes-all championship fight. Instead of
focusing on the key issue - what solution best serves the
customer's needs - some chose to slug it out on products alone,
believing that one platform will flourish, while all the others
will die.
	   The real world however, tells a different story altogether. If
anything, the range of platforms in use today are becoming more
diverse as savvy customers have learned to pick platforms that work
for them - rather than banking on trendy catch-phrases.
	   Indeed, Forrester Research received feedback that customers are
concerned if they depend completely on one single platform, the
consequences of its failure would be too great. But first, some
level-setting. The IT industry has seen three broad phases of
computing. The first, host-based computing, saw the reign of
mainframes - where all data was stored and processed in large
servers, and users accessed this information through terminals.
	   In 1980s, the second phase, known as client-server computing,
saw personal computers (PCs) becoming more widespread and getting
connected to smaller servers, such as Unix or Intel-based servers.
While this was extremely popular with the end-user who had greater
flexibility, enterprises soon realised that there were new issues
to contend with - high support costs, manageability and the
constant need to upgrade PC hardware and software. Today, we live
in the third phase of IT - network computing -where we, and the
computers we live by, are more and more connected.
	   Along with the Internet explosion, intranets and extranets are
allowing users to work and do business as they never have before.
	   It's interesting to note that even while moving from one phase
of computing to another, we still see platforms from all three
phases being used - and used strategically to maximise business
effectiveness. This has been largely due to the result of
technology that enhances communication, collaboration and overall
system management.
	   As the networked world enters the next millennium, we will see
companies striving to improve their business effectiveness by using
IT to work with their suppliers better, reach their customers
faster and share critical information among their employees more
efficiently. This involves large amounts of data spread among
environments that are extremely heterogeneous. In such
environments, we will see a large mix of computing technology and
platforms being deployed to serve different functions effectively.
	   Consulting group DH Andrews compared this scenario to the
deployment of different aircraft types in the air force for
different missions. Although they shared common design
characteristics, it would neither be feasible nor desirable to try
and fit all the functionalities onto one aircraft type.
	   Similarly, different types of servers need to be deployed to do
different tasks effectively. Take a bank, for example. To process
huge volume of customer transactions with sub-second response times
round the clock, round the world, and to move information and data
that affects global financial markets, banks need platforms with a
high degree of robustness and high availability.
	   A natural example would be the mainframes. Banks were among the
first to use technology to further their business objectives. To
identify customers' investment behaviour trends, for example,
through processes like datamining, the bank might choose a Unix
server that can analyse millions of transactions quickly and
efficiently.
	   In the backroom, an Intel-based server running NT may be used as
a departmental server handling administrative tasks like
file/printing, electronic mail, accounting and word processing. In
spite of earlier reports of its demise, today, the mainframe is
growing at about 65 per cent a year.
	   And let's look at Unix, which is perceived to be doing battle
with Windows NT. In an issue of Computerworld Online, IT managers
were asked to compare Unix and NT.
	   While NT was ranked higher than Unix in terms of cost of
ownership and ease of management, Unix fares better when it comes
to performance, reliability and scalability. It was also the
preferred platform for data warehousing and transaction processing.
	   In a recent IDC report on the Asean and South Asia region, it
was projected that Unix shipments will double between now and the
year 2001.
	   According to Forrester Research, 75 per cent of Unix customers
still feel that NT has not changed their commitment to the Unix
platform. However, there is no doubt that Windows NT will grow. Its
popularity with customers and support by most major hardware and
software vendors means that it is likely to become a major player
in the server arena. There is already a profusion of applications
available on NT today. Some businesses will integrate NT into their
IT infrastructure to reap the benefits of lower cost and fit into
the PC management environment. What remains to be seen is whether
it will make inroads into the large enterprise market where
companies have come to rely on their Unix and mainframes to run
most of their applications.
	   In final analysis, each platform has, and will continue, to have
its place. Customers that Forrester Research spoke to saw a need
for different platforms in the future and emphasised that the
choice of platform will be driven by application requirements - one
size does not fit all. While this may make for boring analyst
reports and newspaper copy - the winner, in this world of
distributed, heterogeneous computing, is still, in the end, the
customer.

Hopes for an Arab summit fade as Egypt, Syria express reservations
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-10 with remarks by Pickering
  BY SALAH NASRAWI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Hopes for holding an Arab summit on the
stalled Middle East peace talks faded Thursday after Egypt and
Syria expressed doubts about its outcome.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been pushing for the
conference in a bid to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13 percent
pullback in the West Bank.
	   ``There is no urgency to hold a summit. It will be held if the
peace process is frozen,'' said Osama el-Baz, the chief political
advisor of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   ``The summit is not on the table... what is important is its
contents and its objectives,'' said el-Baz who usually reflects the
Egyptian leader's opinion in foreign policies.
	   His statement came a day after Syria said such a meeting is
unnecessary since some Arab countries are unwilling to implement
resolutions of past summits urging cutting ties with Israel.
	   ``We are not in need of a new summit in as much as we are in
need of an explicit stance and policy which makes the wrong doers
go back to their blunder,'' said a commentary by the state-run
Syrian Arab News Agency.
	   A Jordanian government official said Wednesday that the United
States had asked Jordan and Saudi Arabia to postpone the convening
of an Arab summit by a week to give Washington more time to
persuade Israel to accept its compromise proposal.
	   The request was made by Thomas Pickering, an undersecretary of
state for political affairs, said the Jordanian official, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pickering, speaking to reporters in Bahrain Thursday night, said
the peace process was at a crucial stage and more time was needed
to prepare for an Arab summit.
	   ``If there were going to be an Arab summit, it needed to be very
carefully prepared,'' Pickering said. ``But it's up to Arab leaders
when they will have a summit.''

	   BANKS and financial institutions responsible for the
disbursement of funds under the various funding schemes and
facilities for small and medium industries have one month to
disburse the funds for successful applications.
	   With the new standard set by the Entrepreneur Development
Ministry, banks and financial institutions have two weeks to
respond to unsuccessful applications, its minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed said.
	   ``The Government has set up several funds to help small
entrepreneurs but processing takes a long time and there are cases
where actual disbursement takes a long time.
	   ``This is why we have decided to adopt a standard,'' he said
after launching the Small Entrepreneur Service Centre at the
National Entrepreneur Guidance Centre in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He added that there were cases where successful applicants had
to wait for eight weeks before getting their cheques while some
applicants had to wait between three to six months before getting a
reply on their applications.
	   The delay in processing, he said, was faced by many of the
entrepeneurs who applied for the various funds managed by the
Credit Guarantee Corp (CGC) and financial institutions.
	   The main problem, he added, was the unwillingness of banks to
process the applications. To overcome this, small entrepreneurs can
now also submit their applications directly to the ministry and
CGC.
	   ``In the past, applications from small entrepreneurs were
submitted directly to the banks, now they can submit applications
directly to the ministry and CGC.
	   ``This is to overcome problems and to monitor the progress (of
applications),'' he said, adding that banks will still be
responsible for processing the applications and disbursing the
funds.
	   The ministry, he said, will assist in the filling in of forms
where the Small Entrepreneur Service Centre, for example, has four
officers on hand to assist small entrepreneurs who may face
problems in filling in their application forms.
	   These officers will also be on hand to answer queries from the
small entrepreneur, he added.

MANUFACTURERS today are faced with challenges, which could range

<TEXT>
from the need to capture new markets and increase productivity, to
reducing cycle time for new product development, minimising costs
to keep prices competitive, as well as being responsive to
customers' preferences.
	   These factors require manufacturers to develop new strategies
and products in order to strengthen their long-term competitive
advantage.
	   However, according to Bank Negara's 1997 annual report,
producing distinctive and differentiated products, and investing in
high value-added and knowledge-based industries alone may not be
sufficient.
	   The critical issues that really need to be addressed are
productivity enhancement and cost competitiveness, said Sirim
Berhad's president Dr Mohd Ariffin Aton.
	   He added that the Bank Negara report also highlighted that total
productivity could be enhanced through several measures such as the
introduction of new technology and innovation, or upgrading of
existing technology and enhancement of information technology (IT)
architecture.
	   One technology that has served the manufacturing sector well is
computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM).
	   According to Mohd Ariffin, CAD/CAM technology is now considered
a strategic and critical tool in the manufacturing process.
	   ``Manufacturers can solve their problems and improve
productivity by using powerful CAD/CAM systems offered in the
market,'' he said at a CAD/CAM seminar held in Sungei Besi
recently.
	   Realising this, the National CAD/CAM Centre was established, and
is aimed at promoting the latest technologies to the local
manufacturers.
	   Mohd Ariffin said increasing competition to extend market share
in existing and new markets requires innovation in product design,
which is served by the utilisation of the CAD/CAM technology. ``We
see that the use of this technology has become pervasive in
manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing industries.''
	   The National CAD/CAM Centre offers training and consultancy work
to local businesses in the areas of integrated manufacturing
system, production system and CAD/CAM services as an effort to
promote the use of this technology.
	   ``Small and medium-sized industries (SMIs) with limited funds
can now seek the centre's facilities that allow manufacturers to
access our facilities or other manufacturers' facilities, as well
as sharing of databases,'' he said.
	   The facilities are set up in the form of a virtual manufacturing
station or virtual design office where industries are linked via an
electronic network that enables them to operate as one enterprise
regardless of locations, Mohd Ariffin said.
	   According to him, the network will allow companies with similar
computer and CAD systems to exchange data.
	   He said the network will also be linked to manufacturing
activities in Sirim, such as the rapid prototyping laboratory, and
material censor and machine workshop, as well as to other research
centres and universities.
	   ``SMIs will be able to make use of the transfer of technology as
well as gain valuable information without having to move from their
offices,'' he added.
	   In addition, this system helps companies achieve quality
improvement due to more accurate information, data and expertise,
faster cycle time and product development time, to collaborative
work and interoperability and exchange of CAD/CAM data.
	   According to Ariffin, application of CAD/CAM and computer-aided
engineering (CAE) in Malaysia is expected to increase despite the
current economic situation.
	   ``One of the significant advantages using this technology in
product development is the integration of systems to various
downstream activities and interoperability among up stream
applications for design development and manufacturing,'' he said.
	   Suppliers of CAD/CAM systems now offer applications that are
fast, and equipped with value-added facilities such as prototyping,
visualisation, simulation and virtual reality.
	   ``It is now possible to produce one model for the entire
manufacturing process in which applications can work together
intelligently, and users can freely transfer data and experiences
from one application to another.
	   For example, the integration of CAD and CAM link the design
department and the machine shop or rapid prototyping machine with
one database, allowing the smooth flow of CAD information essential
for concurrent development and reduce time to market,'' said
Ariffin.
	   Stating another example, he said the integration of CAD and CAE
will provide similar transfer of data which expedites the product
development process by allowing the analysis to be done directly
from a CAD drawing.
	   ``An integrated system will ultimately give better quality
product, shorter design-to-manufacture cycle time, and above all,
manufactures can thus remain competitive.
	   ``Users of CAD/CAM system in this country especially
manufacturers involved in product development should aim to
integrate their systems to provide competitive design and
manufacturing solutions in the challenging market,'' said Mohd
Ariffin.
	   He said the current CAD system has the capability to do tasks
such as data management, and generate and organise the bill of
material as well as system administration.
	   ``The product data management (PDM), which is part of CAD
software, also enables companies to manage diverse information
throughout product life cycle, and comply with the writing type of
design and manufacturing regulatory standards.
	   ``Information stored in a CAD system can be shared among many
people at once, enabling the design process to be done
concurrently.''
	   Although PDM is popular in developed countries, he said the
process is still new locally and the industry needs to be more
exposed to the importance of this system, which will gradually lead
to more efficient and effective CAD/CAM application.
	   Rapid prototyping, he said, is ideal to the creation of complex
three-dimensional (3-D) parts, directly from CAD drawing and with
little human intervention.
	   This helps the industry to compete in the marketplace where
product quality and time to market are critical.
	   ``Using these technologies, a design review cycle can be
significantly reduced whereby the designers do not have to wait for
months to see the results of improvement to the existing design,''
Mohd Ariffin said.
	   He observed that another important development is the use of the
Internet for CAD/CAM data communications, considered an emerging
technology in the manufacturing industry.
	   ``Fast and powerful systems, and advanced software enable design
and manufacturing teams to collaborate worldwide, to identify and
resolve design and manufacturing problems using the Internet,'' he
said.
	   ``The ability to share 3-D models with all members of product
design teams through the Internet empowers engineers by ensuring
that everyone is kept informed and will therefore contribute to the
project,'' he added.
	   It is also possible for a product to be designed at one location
and manufactured in another. The Internet provides a relatively
cheap and effective tool to achieve concurrent engineering,
according to Mohd Ariffin.
	   ``Many tools associated with the Internet such as Java
programming language and virtual reality modelling language enable
CAD data to be published in the World Wide Web and made accessible
to users across the world,'' he said.
	   ``This allows users to share data within the company as well as
with suppliers, sub-contractors and customers and thus help speed
up product development process.''
	   ``With the Government's emphasis on using high technology and
the Multimedia Super Corridor, effective use of CAD/CAM is a
necessity for the manufacturing industry to survive in national and
global markets,'' he added.

HUMOUR runs deep on the Internet, so it's little wonder there's

<TEXT>
a site devoted to the parodies of Weird Al Yankovic. Yankovic!
(http://www.emsphone.com/yankovic) seems oddly similar to the

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim yesterday
directed the Agriculture Ministry to find cheaper sources for rice
to meet local demand following the shortage caused by lower rice
production in the country, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Minister Datuk Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob said.
	   Due to water shortage, domestic rice production has dropped by
20 per cent. This had resulted in the increase in the price of
locally-produced rice by 21 per cent and imported-rice by 52 per
cent.
	   Megat Junid said his ministry had highlighted the problem at the
Cabinet meeting.
	   At present, rice are being sourced from traditional markets such
as Thailand and Myanmar.
	   The increase in the prices of the rice were seen since May 1,
Megat Junid said after attending the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   Domestic production of rice had dropped from 18,000 tonnes per
ha to between 15,000 tonnes and 16,000 tonnes. Farmers too
complained that the quality of the rice produced had dropped
especially in areas where water supply is at the minimum, he said.
	   Sixty-five per cent of the country's consumption of rice comes
from domestic production, he added.
	   Meanwhile, Megat Junid also announced that effective January 1
next year, all petrol oil companies in the country must sell only
unleaded petrol. All the companies must clear their stock of leaded
petrol before the end of the year.
	   The move, he said, is aimed at curbing emission of carbon
monoxide into the atmosphere, which is not only hazardous to the
health but also causes depletion of the zone layer.
	   He said oil companies have been very cooperative in enhancing
the consumption on unleaded petrol in the country.
	   Last year, the consumption of unleaded petrol in Malaysia was
recorded at more than five million kilo litres compared with that
of leaded petrol which was at 1.1 million kilo litres.

Hartwig breaks American Record in pole vault
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Adds Hartwig quotes
  By SALVATORE ZANCA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France (AP) - Jeff Hartwig set a American pole vault
record Thursday, bettering 6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1/4 inches) at
the St. Denis international track meet.
	   Hartwig bettered the previous mark of 5.98 meters (19-7 1/2) set
in May. 1996 by Lawrence Johnson.
	   He said the 6.00 barrier to pole vaulters is like the 4 minute
mile in on the track.
	   ``All the vaulters are chasing that mark. There are about seven
Americans over 19 feet in the vault but only one over 6 meters,''
Hartwig said. .''
	   Hartwig, a 30-year-old from Arkansas State and Jonesboro,
Arkansas , had a good series, starting at 5.55 and then clearing
5.70 meters, 5.8 and 5.9 on his second attempt.
	   He missed twice at 6.00 then went over on his third attempt,
hitting the bar on his way over.
	   ``I was close on my first two attempts and I thought I have to
be patient with the jump and make things happen,'' Hartwig said. ``
I stayed with the pole to get all the energy on my third jump and
went right over it.''
	   Hartwig's last year was 5.85. although he did 5.86 indoors this
year and added a 5.92 at the Prefontaine meet in Oregon where he
tried 6.00 for the first time.
	   ``I had tried 6.00 at four competitions this year,'' Hartwig
said. ``So it was only a matter of time.''
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who took over the crown as the
top middle distance runner in the world last year, won the 1,500
meters Thursday at the St. Denis international athletics meeting.
	   El Guerrouj's time, 3 minutes, 32.34 seconds, was far from his
best. He had four races under 3:30 last year.
	   However it was just his second race of the season. He did
3:31.18 but it was overshadowed Monday by a world record in the
10,000 by Haile Gebrselassie
	   The 24-year-old El Guerrouj was known for his fall entering the
final lap at the Atlanta Olympics 1,500 giving the title to
Noureddine Morceli, who had dominated the distance for nearly 6
years.
	   In 1997 El Guerrouj finally overtook Morceli, taking the world
championship and being unbeaten for the season and setting world
records at two distances indoor.
	   El Guerrouj has sparked a running revival in Morocco, where Said
Aouita ruled in the mid 1980s. Moroccan women took the 800 and
5,000 o Thursday.
	   Hasna Benhassi took the women's 800 in 1:59.71, the first time
under 2:00 for the 20-year-old.
	   Two-time world cross-country champion Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland was soundly beaten in her 5,000 race, coming in third
behind Zohra Ouaziz of Morocco and Gete Wami of Ethiopia.
	   O'Sullivan won both the long and short distance races in a
double at the world cross country meet in Morocco in March.
	   ``It's still the beginning of the season,'' O'Sullican said. ``I
want to do the 1,500. My goal is to win the Europeans in Budapest.
The other competitions are just practice races.''
	   Ouaziz ran a season best 14:42.11 with O'Sullivan doing 15:03.76
	   Ouaziz found the conditions tough.
	   ``I had problems with the windy weather,'' Ouaziz said. ``I was
afraid to take off. It's a pity. We both could have gone under
14:40.
	   Christine Aaron of France, fresh from a 10.95 last week,
confirmed her timing with a 10.99 victory.
	   Former world champion Samuel Matete of Zambia took the 400
hurdles in 48.90. He found the conditions difficult.
	   ``It went well but there's a lot of wind,'' Matete said. ``Te
time wasn't brilliant. I've done 48.32.''
	   The women's 400 hurdles went to Olympic champion Deon Hemmings
of Jamaica, 54.21, beating 1995 world champion Kim Batten of the
United States,

WHEN a sleepy Mick Buffum drove off a New York State country

<TEXT>
road and flipped his car, it was 2am and no other motorists were
around to help him. However, an emergency crew located him
immediately. That's because Buffum is in a US government test
programme of a new car system, according to a report. It
automatically reports for help after a serious crash, and gives the
car's exact location.
	   The system, which is being tested on 500 vehicles, could be
available widely in about five years. When a motor vehicle crashes,
an electronic box about 14 centimetres square and 3cm deep under
the backseat transmits the exact location to a government
satellite, through the car's cellular phone.
	   The satellite then beams the information to a computer at an
emergency centre, and the computer displays the crash location on a
map.
	   The box also provides information about the severity of the
crash and whether the vehicle was hit in the front, rear or side,
or rolled over.
	   The technology is being developed by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and Caltrans, a private company.

THE World Wide Web has brought television fans together. Where

<TEXT>
once they had to physically gather someplace, such as Star Trek
conventions, now they can share their mutual interest online.
	   Fans of The X-Files show their devotion to Dana Scully at the
Order of the Blessed St Scully the Enigmatic (http://www.
security-one.com/obsse).
	   To find information on specific TV programmes, a helpful site to
check is Ultimate TV (http://www.ultimatetv.com) and its Ultimate
TV Show List, an alphabetical listing of TV programmes and their
fan-created Web pages.
	   One of them is Dallas Megasite, a Web page created by Mark Delfs
of New York which is an online clearinghouse of details on the
well-known TV series including photos, cast list, trivia and links
to other Dallas sites that offer still more minutiae.
	   Dallas Megasite has registered more than 63,000 hits since its
creation in April last year, including a visit from Larry Hagman's
secretary, who sent Delfs an electronic mail that's enshrined on
the site.
	   Steven McKinnon, also of New York, created House Harkonnen
(http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/), a page named after
characters from Dune. It's primarily devoted to the TV series Star
Trek: Voyager.
	   At his site, McKinnon includes reviews of every episode of
Voyager, plus two unusual ``more-than-you-ever-needed-to-know''
features. ``Style Ocampa''
	   is a catalogue of all the outfits worn by the Keebler Elf-like
alien Kes (Jennifer Lien) until her departure from the show earlier
this season.
	   And ``Roll Call keeps track of all the minor Voyager characters
(we're talking background extras here), the episodes they've
appeared in or been mentioned in and the current crew complement.
	   McKinnon freely acknowledges that such trivia is probably
inconsequential to many viewers, but he also realises it's ``the
kind of stuff computer fans and Star Trek nuts love''.

  Eds: UPDATES with transport ministry official saying wheel failure
was likely cause, details on dining car, edits throughout  
  AP Photos ESC101,104,113
  By TONY CZUCZKA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews expecting to find more
bodies labored to disentangle a high-speed train from the wreckage
of a bridge Thursday, while authorities pointed to a wheel failure
as a possible cause of Germany's worst post-war rail disaster.
	   Deutsche Bahn took all 60 of its first-generation InterCity
Express trains out of service as they finished their runs Thursday,
idling more than half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   At least 100 people died, according to Lower Saxony state
officials, when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 crashed and
broke apart at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning
in Eschede, a small town 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said. Forty-three second-generation trains introduced since 1996
remain in service, and it was unclear how rapidly normal service
would resume on the 3,500-kilometer (2,175-mile) system.
	   Earlier, Deutsche Bahn lowered the speed limit for all InterCity
Express trains to 160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour on all ICE
trains until they could be inspected.
	   Horst Stuchly, president of the federal railway office, said
there was no indication of human error and that a break in a wheel
was emerging as a possible cause. In an interview on ARD
television, Stuchly added that part of the train derailed 300
meters (yards) before the train reached the overpass.
	   A spokeswoman for the federal transport ministry told The
Associated Press that a broken wheel on the first car behind the
lead locomotive may have been a factor. She did not elaborate.
	   By Thursday afternoon, 90 bodies had been recovered at the scene
and three people had died in hospitals. State officials said 200
people were injured, of whom 95 were treated in hospitals.
	   Bodies, or parts of them, were taken to Hanover for
identification.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,''
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people who gathered
Thursday evening for a memorial service at the town's Lutheran
church, the Johanniskirche.
	   Officials said a detailed, forensic investigation would begin
only after all of the victims had been removed the debris. Workers
hammered away at the arching ruins of the overpass to reach a
first-class car and a dining car _ the last two to be excavated.
	   The two cars could accommodate 72 passengers in all.
	   The weekly Rheinischer Merkur newspaper reported Thursday that
federal experts found indications that one of the coaches on the
northbound train derailed about six kilometers (3.7 miles) south of
the overpass.
	   The coach was dragged along the rail bed until it came to a
turnout near the overpass where it swung sideways, hitting concrete
pillars, the newspaper said.
	   Spokesmen for the emergency teams said they had no information
on the report, and the federal railway office had no comment.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.
	   Officials said it appeared that the fifth car of the 12-car
train hit the bridge as it went through. The back end of the car
was broken off; the fourth car veered off the rails and rolled onto
it side, while three other cars jackknifed further up the line.
	   The lead locomotive remained on the tracks and the driver
apparently was unaware of the incident, coming to a stop only after
the station master at Eschede activated an emergency brake.
	   The rest of the train was squashed beneath or against the
collapsed overpass. The four tracks were strewn with debris _ some
from the crash, some created by rescuers ripping apart the
wreckage.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl pledged 1 million marks (dlrs 550,000) in
government aid, matching donations of the same size from the state
government and the railway, after visiting the crash scene.
	   ``The goal must be to identify the bodies as quickly as
possible,'' Kohl said.
	   Nearly five dozen clergymen and counselors arrived in the city
to counsel relatives and rescue workers.
	   Authorities set up a reception center for worried relatives in
in a sports hall in Eschede. The window shades were drawn and a
sign warning ``No Press'' was attached to plastic sheets covering
the door.
	   ``I still can't believe that this has cost so many lives. This
is just a little village in the heath that no one has ever heard
of,'' said Birgit Puhl, 42, a Red Cross volunteer who had driven 30
kms (20 miles) from her home in Wathlingen to extend help to
relatives of the dead and injured.

founding the company in 1976 has never managed to establish any
kind of broad public acknowledgement, mainly because of its focus
on the business software that does much of the unglamorous
behind-the-scenes work involved in managing mainframes and networks
of servers and personal computers.

ARAB-MALAYSIAN Finance Berhad (AMFB) has installed a fully

<TEXT>
automated system for submission of reports to Bank Negara, which is
expected to be operational this month.
	   The new system, developed by Winfair Resources Sdn Bhd at a cost
of RM300,000, is expected to help the bank prepare reports at a
much faster rate, and with better accuracy and control.
	   AMFB's head of information services department Andy Tan Eng Teik
said the Winfair Bank Negara Data Submission System (BNDSS) is able
to help the bank produce reports in two days, compared to seven
days using the old reporting methodology.
	   He stressed that the system automates the input, which was
previously done manually, and also generates reports complying to
Bank Negara's format.
	   ``With BNDSS, a user needs to verify download of data from the
various sources and once that is done the user can run the
reporting system,'' Tan told Computimes in Kuala Lumpur recently.
	   In comparison, the old system, which comprises both manual and
computerised systems, requires that data is keyed into a
spreadsheet program and reports generated comply with Bank Negara's
requirements.
	   He said that with this methodology, input for the spreadsheet
program is done manually from various sources, namely reports
generated from the bank's software applications used in AMFB's
departments.
	   According to Tan, data sources for Winfair BNDSS include the
bank's mainframe and personal computer (PC) computing platforms and
the various software applications and paper-based reports used.
	   He added that the user interface of Winfair BNDSS has also been
customised to comply to AMFB's requirements to allow for
ease-of-use.
	   ``The system is also in line with AMFB's information technology
(IT) architecture,'' Tan said, adding that the system's modular
design also allows easy incorporation of changes in the bank's
reporting requirements.
	   Tan said failure to meet submission deadline of Bank Negara
reports could result in a RM1 million fine, and RM1,000 fine each
consecutive day after the designated date.
	   ``Thus, it's crucial for us to have an efficient reporting
system,'' he added.
	   The Bank Negara reports that can be produced by Winfair BNDSS
include weekly reports on domestic assets and liabilities, monthly
reports on domestic assets and liabilities, quarterly reports on
domestic assets and liabilities, and quarterly reports on unaudited
income and expenditure.

A self-driven or self-paced training such as online learning

<TEXT>
will fast replace traditional classroom lectures. However, there
are issues which learners must address before adapting such a
learning approach.
	   Technophobia: For those who are not completely comfortable with
computers may suffer technophobia. Some may be tempted to take a
quick computer and Internet course to overcome this problem.
However, invariably taking such a course would leave them feeling
overwhelmed.
	   Immersion is suitable for learners who have some experience, but
inexperienced learners will feel as though they are drowning. Avoid
seeing the delivery technology as the training delivered is not
even recognised.
	   If the learners are afraid of or uncomfortable with computers,
they need to take a few months to learn their way around the
following software: browser such as Netscape's Navigator or
Microsoft's Explorer, word processing program such as WordPerfect
or Word 98, and a file manager. If the learners have problems using
a mouse, play a mouse-driven computer game such as Patience for a
few hours.
	   Typing skills: Good online courses have chat rooms where the
learners can meet others. However, taking part in real-time dynamic
chat requires them to have some basic typing skills. So, before
joining an online course, learn to chat. Download a program such as
mIRC or ICQ or go to a Web-based chat area such as Yahoo! chat or
WBS to practice talking with others online.
	   Isolation: In a conventional classroom, learners always work in
groups in which they indirectly motivate, support and encourage one
another.
	   However, in an online learning environment, this kind of contact
is absent. Conventionally, when dealing with the basics of a new
subject, learners tend to experience a feeling of excitement. As
the real work begins, the learners would like to share the
experience with one another.
	   Sharing the learning experience provides a morale boost
necessary to completing the next steps.
	   In an online learning environment, the learners may not only
miss the spirit of sharing, but also miss the peer tutoring.
	   Peer tutoring, where one learner instructs another, allows the
learners to study the necessary concept in different terms from the
formal presentation. It also promotes bonding among themselves,
making them more resilient and more likely to perform well.
	   Despite the absence of peer contact, online learners need not be
panic.
	   Using the internet technology, a virtual team spirit can be
built up. This can be done by ``meeting'' one another in chat
rooms, communicating via electronic mail (e-mail) and leaving
messages on Net notice boards.
	   Culture shock: If the learners are not on a strictly in-house
online training programme, chances are they will be part of an
international learning group. The mores of each participants may
not be the same, thus misunderstandings are sometimes inevitable.
However, if the learners take care and follow the rules of internet
culture, known as netiquette, they should be able to avoid major
misunderstandings.
	   It takes little time for new learners to become used to online
culture.
	   Static communications which take places via notice boards and
e-mail are as familiar as an office memo. An understanding of some
general acronyms and smileys such as ROTFL (rolling on the floor
laughing), :-) (I'm smiling) and S (I'm smiling) are important.
These conventions are easy to learn and using them would give the
learners a great boost of confidence. To find lists of signs and
their meanings on the Net, search for key words ``acronym,
smiley''. Also look for guides to Internet etiquette by searching
for key words such as ``netiquette'', ``e-mail etiquette'' and
``chat etiquette''.
	   Language: It is important that the learners are comfortable with
the language being used. Although online learning materials can be
revised at will, it will be discouraging if the learners have
difficulties learning the content due to language problems. If this
problem occur, the learners should consider taking a course to
improve their language skills. However, as an alternative, the
learners can choose to join a class or a chat group inhabited by
speakers of their native language.
	   In a few sophisticated online courses, translated materials are
offered.
	   However, this service cannot offer peer-to-peer contact. If
language is a real obstacle, but the learners are in a hurry to
pick up a particular skill, it is best to look for a package
offered in a language they are comfortable with.

France: India and Pakistan can't afford isolation
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ India and Pakistan must turn away from nuclear
weapons because they cannot afford to isolate themselves, France's
foreign minister said Thursday after the five original nuclear
powers urged the two to stop testing and talk.
	   ``These countries can't extract themselves in the long term from
the world in which they live,'' Hubert Vedrine told reporters after
the five's foreign ministers met, producing a ``clear'' and
``substantial'' statement.
	   Vedrine also defended the ministers' concentration on the crisis
over India and Pakistan, rather than addressing other issues such
as Israel's nuclear capacity.
	   ``I don't think you should mix together all the problems,'' he
said.
	   ``We have two countries out of 185 which are on the wrong track
... it has to be they who are wrong,'' he added.
	   Vedrine said he had placed particular insistence on mentioning
action on the production of fissile material, which arms
negotiators refer to as the ``cut off'' treaty because it would
stop the production of nuclear weapons, as an important future
target.
	   He rejected suggestions that nuclear weapons would improve the
security situation of India and Pakistan.
	   ``The fundamental security problem of these two countries is a
disagreement on Kashmir,'' he said. ``I don't see what (nuclear
weapons) bring to India and Pakistan in their ability to have a
dialogue to finally find a solution to the complicated Kashmir
problem.''
	   An ultimate aim would be to bring India and Pakistan into action
coordinated by the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members,
he said.
	   ``Later, at a moment to be defined but not yet, it could be
useful or even decisive for there to be a pact between the five
permanent members and India, between the five permanent members and
Pakistan,'' he said.
	   ``It's our duty to try everything,'' Vedrine concluded, although
reaffirming French opposition to using sanctions. He declined to
predict how soon a response from the two countries would come.

Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela to cut oil output by 450,000
</HEADLINE>
barrels

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela
agreed to cut their oil output by 450,000 barrels a day starting of
July 1, the Saudi Oil Ministry said late Thursday.
	   Saudi Arabia promised to cut 225,000 barrels a day, Venezuela by
125,000 and Mexico by 100,000 barrels a day, said a ministry
statement.
	   Oil ministers from the three countries came to the agreement
during their meeting in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. But the
announcement was made in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
	   Both Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are members of the Organization
of Oil Producing Countries. Mexico is not a member.
	   The three countries agreed on the move because ``the market
remains in a state of imbalance'' the statement said.
	   A deal to trim output in order to raise prices was negotiated by
the three states at a meeting in Riyadh on March 22. Producers
pledged to cut back by some 1.7 million barrels a day. Since then,
prices have risen up to about dlrs 15 a barrel for light sweet
crude in the United States.
	   Some OPEC countries have said they would like to see the prices
go up to dlrs 18 per barrel.
	   Combined with cuts from non-OPEC countries like Norway and
Yemen, the deal removed about 1.5 million barrels a day from the
world oil supply.
	   Thursday's statement said the three countries will contact other
OPEC and non-OPEC members to ``reach further cutbacks in the
production above the levels agreed upon in March 1998.''

British prime minister pressing for resolution of Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Warning of ``a serious and
deteriorating situation'' in Kosovo, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Thursday that the European Union was mulling how to stop
the fighting in the troubled Serbian province.
	   Britain, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, was
consulting with its partners in the union and the Contact Group to
discuss ``what actions we can take,'' Blair said.
	   He mentioned that the discussions included talk of sanctions,
but pressed for details, he refused to elaborate.
	   ``We are looking very carefully at how we can send a strong
message ... that we regard this as an extremely important strategic
interest,'' Blair told reporters after a short meeting with Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok.
	   ``We will work closely to analyze the things that are necessary
to make sure we deal with the situation,'' he added.
	   Fears of another Balkans war have been rising since Serbs
launched an offensive aimed at smashing resistance to their
authority in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 10 to 1 in
the secessionist province.
	   Dozens are believed dead since the start of a stepped-up
campaign last week by the Serbs, who want to wipe out the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. At least 80 people were
killed in a similar crackdown in March, and well over 200 people
have died this year in clashes.
	   ``We regard this situation deteriorating further as
unacceptable,'' Blair said, stressing ``how important it is for
there to be a proper solution.''
	   The Dutch stop was part of Blair's tour of European capitals
this week ahead of the EU summit in Cardiff, Wales, later this
month.

	   THE new entity arising from the merger of two international
consulting firms - Price Waterhouse and Coopers  Lybrand - will be
known as PricewaterhouseCoopers. The merger has been cleared by the
European Commission and the new global organisation comes into
being on July 1. Mr Nicholas G. Moore is chairman of Coopers 
Lybrand International and chairman-designate of
PricewaterhouseCoopers while Mr James J. Schiro, chief executive
officer of Price Waterhouse, is the CEO-designate of the merged
entity. In a joint statement, the companies said the new name was
selected to preserve the substantial equity, value and heritage
associated with the firms. ``We are rapidly effecting global
integration of our two organisations so that clients can benefit
fully for the problem-solving capabilities, global knowledge and
industry expertise of the world's premier professional services
organisation.'' Price Waterhouse and Coopers  Lybrand have a
combined workforce of more than 130,000. In Malaysia, Price
Waterhouse and Coopers  Lybrand are expected to announce details
of the new organisation later this month.

RANDBURG Malaysia Sdn Bhd, the local representative office of

<TEXT>
Randburg Ltd which focuses on delivering advertising, designing,
Internet and computing businesses, has introduced a multi-lingual
service for home pages.
	   Claiming to be the first local company to provide such service,
Randburg believes that a home page with major world languages
feature can help promote the product not only to English-speaking
countries but also those using other languages.
	   According to Randburg Malaysia's director Mohd Waffa, many local
companies have wasted their investment by putting home pages that
cannot be reached globally because of language issue.
	   ``The language problem may sound simple, but just imagine if we
advertise our service in a home page that has multiple languages,
the impact will be wider,'' he said.
	   Other than giving home page services, Randburg Malaysia is also
responsible for providing the translation which will be done in the
United States. The process will take about 10 days to complete,
depending on the frequency of changes.
	   Mohd Waffa said Randburg employs only certified translators for
the translation job to ensure quality. He added that the parent
company has about 1,500 customers worldwide, which include
governments bodies, semi-governments, hotels, banking and airline
companies.
	   ``It is the only service that goes to more than 200 search
engines and 150 nations,'' he said.
	   Randburg Malaysia plans to promote the new service among
import/export companies, local foreign-based companies, hotels and
resorts. ``It is suitable for businesses that aim to market their
businesses globally, especially for tourism purposes,'' Mohd Waffa
said.
	   The company, he added, is now negotiating with five potential
customers and it is targeting to have about 300 customers by the
end of this year.

	   THE Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research
(Aciar) is collaborating with the Science, Technology and
Environment Ministry in a US$850,000 (US$1    RM3.92) project to
conduct mangrove study in the Sungai Merbok estuary in Kedah.
	   With this, Aciar hopes to learn the importance of mangroves as a
coastal habitat and relates it to the commercial production of
prawns.
	   ``Understanding the role of mangroves in supporting commercial
fisheries will assist planners to develop coastal areas without
damaging the fisheries they support.
	   ``So, if you lose the mangroves, it does not mean that you lose
the fisheries too,'' Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation marine ecologist Dr Neil Loneragan
said.
	   He said Malaysia has similar species of prawns with Australia
which triggered the interest to carry out their field work in the
country.
	   The three-year joint project has been carried out for a year.
	   ``The mangroves in Selangor and Johor have experienced quite a
change and we hope to see whether this has affected the prawns or
not,'' he said in a press conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The institute plans to establish a Geographic Information System
for the region which can be useful in coastal planning, assessing
changes in habitats and developing aquaculture projects.
	   ``We hope to provide the technical expertise to look at
historical changes and the extinct of mangroves in the region,'' he
said.
	   When told that Malaysia is currently promoting aquaculture
activities as part of the Government's efforts to increase local
food production, Dr Loneragan said that it is important to
carefully plan the aquaculture development first.
	   He said previous experience from countries including Taiwan,
Thailand and some places in Malaysia have shown that improper
planning of such activities could easily cause problems such as
disease outbreaks.
	   ``It needs to be carefully planned and the impact of aquaculture
needs to be assessed because it could have affected the natural
fisheries population,'' he added.
	   Besides Peninsular Malaysia, the centre is also working on
similar projects in Sarawak, Vietnam and Indonesia.

NETSCAPE Communications Corp intends to focus on the enterprise

<TEXT>
and Internet service provider (ESP/ISP) markets for the coming year
as a key strategy to get back to profitability.
	   According to its vice president and general manager for
inter-continental operations Linda Lawrence, the company wants to
provide solutions that will enable ESPs/ISPs to create a
service-ready infrastructure for Internet-based services for
internal and external customers.
	   She cited some examples of Internet-based services that Netscape
is keen to be involved in such as employee directory services,
human resource self-administration, expense report tracking and
online account management.
	   Netscape managed to pull through a rough first quarter by
breaking even, a feat that surprised many market analysts who had
predicted that the California-based company would report a loss in
revenue instead. Netscape reported revenues totalling US$127.2
million (RM483 million) for the three months ending April 30 this
year as compared to US$125.3 million for the same period last year.
	   Lawrence said Netscape suffered a loss of US$13 million in
browser revenues when it decided to make its Navigator browser
free, upon mounting pressure from Microsoft.
	   It also released the source code for its Communicator 5.0 client
on the Internet. Netscape estimates that there were more than
250,000 downloads of the source code in the first month of the
code's availability.
	   ``Everyone was wondering how we were ever going to make up for
the revenue loss plus Netscape was also undergoing a restructuring
exercise last quarter,'' Lawrence said.
	   As part of its new corporate strategy, Netscape has now
realigned the company according to three major lines of business:
browsers, enterprise software and online services (NetCenter).
	   Netscape's client software serves to seed the market for its
enterprise solutions and NetCenter. In addition, Lawrence informed
that Netscape will no longer be focusing on the groupware market.
``We are not abandoning that segment. Instead, we will let the ISPs
handle the needs of smaller organisations and individuals. There's
not a lot of revenue to be made in the groupware market today.''
	   According to Netscape's managing director of Asia South Ramesh
Nava, the company wants to be a clear market leader for Internet
commerce in the business-to-business space.
	   ``Based on market research report, 68 per cent of the business
in this region will be electric commerce (e-commerce) centric. To
gain market recognition in this area, Netscape will increase
e-commerce awareness through education, training and marketing,''
he said.
	   ``There's still a lot of cloud surrounding e-commerce today,
very few fully understand how e-commerce can be turned into
business benefits and how to implement it.''
	   To help local information technology (IT) companies get onto the
e-commerce bandwagon, Netscape is expanding its professional
services capabilities by forming a regional support team of
e-commerce specialists, business consultants and project management
experts.
	   ``We don't want to be seen just as a product-oriented company.
We want to be able to map business needs according to solutions we
offer,'' Nava said.
	   Netscape will also announce a new programme to build a strong
channel support infrastructure for the intranet/extranet software
market, which the International Data Corp has predicted will be a
US$20 billion business worldwide in the next two years.
	   According to Nava, Netscape plans to appoint at least five to 10
intranet/extranet systems integrators for each of the major
markets, which includes Malaysia. Last quarter, it announced that
companies such as Citibank, NuSkin International, Netcom, Litton
Industries and Hong Kong Telecom have standardised on Netscape
products to build their online franchises.
	   Netscape's enterprise software and services contributed US$96.1
million this quarter, up 41 per cent from the same period of last
year. Its enterprise business currently consists of five key
product areas: applications server, CommerceXpert, Internet
messaging, Mission Control, and Web Information Sharing.
	   The company recently entered into a worldwide agreement to
license its electronic commerce software to Citibank.
	   Citibank will use the CommerceXpert family of packaged Internet
Commerce applications, Netscape Application Server and Directory
Server to build a service-ready infrastructure for electronic
commerce applications.
	   Revenues from NetCenter, the W eb site portion of Netscape's
business amounted to US$31.1 million, as compared to US$21.3
million for the same quarter last year.
	   Netscape claims that it still maintains a lead in the browser
market with about 60 to 80 per cent share, based on the company's
composite of leading Internet sites that report browser statistics.

A POPULAR and free place to chat is Yahoo! chat. Go to

<TEXT>
http://www.yahoo.com and click on the tiny link at the top right
hand quarter of the page called ``chat''.
	   Look for the tag ``New user'' at the left side of the page and
click on ``Click here to register''. Fill out the form.
	   Now all you need to do is read and accept the chat agreement.
Click on ``View agreement''.
	   Read it. If you agree click on ``I accept''. If you don't agree
then Yahoo! chat is not for you.
	   Choose your favourite platform. You have the choice between a
plug-in.
	   Java or hypertext markup language (HTML). (If you make a mistake
you just won't see anything, in which case press your back button
and guess again.) Take time out to read what's coming up soon.
There are lots of interesting things scheduled and this screen is
updated every few days.
	   Next, look at the top right quarter of the screen and click on
``Complete Room List''. You will find the room under the following
categories: Arts  Entertainment, General, News  Business,
Regional, Sports, Science, Romance, Society  Culture and Teen.
	   Before joining others it is best to practice chatting somewhere
private.
	   To create your private room enter one of the catagories, for
example, Society and Culture. Enter a room. Any room will do! Then
in the bottom lefthand of the screen click on the link ``Create A
Room''.
	   A ready filled out form will appear. Make sure you select a
Private room as you are just using this for practice and don't want
any visitors. Click on ``Create my room''. Your room will be
created and you will automatically be placed in it.
	   Time to experiment!: First in the box which says ``Say/reload''
type a message and either press Enter or click on the
``Say/Reload'' button. Your name will appear in red and your text
will appear in blue.
	   Want your text to appear in another colour? You can't do this in
your private room or if you have chosen to use the HTML option for
a platform, but try this when you're chatting with others.
	   Type (colour) and then your text, for example (green)I'm sooooo
envious! Then press Enter and see your text appear in colour. The
following colours are available: green, red, yellow, grey, blue,
black and a weird blue/green called aqua.
	   Want to show emotion? Yahoo! allows you to use normal emoticons
such as :) and LOL but also offers a service where your emotions
appear in pink.
	   Let's say you are thirsty and say so. Someone might ``pass'' you
a beer.
	   How? They use a colon and type :passing the thirsty one a beer.
This will appear in pink. Want to send a private message to
someone? (Or in cool chat speak ``When you want to PM someone ....)
Just simply click once on their name in the list on the right side
of your screen, and then fill in the form.
	   From what I have seen, PMing is not common in Yahoo! chat.
	   However, it's useful in a busy room if you want to catch
someone's attention to go to a private room or if you want to give
someone your e-mail address.
	   OK, now it's time to go chatting for real. Before you go have a
look at the menu at the bottom of the page.
	   Where am I?: Tells you where you are. You can also look at the
right hand side of the screen to see this which is quicker and
easier.
	   Change room: Let's you choose where you want to go next.
	   Who's online?: Allows you to search for friends by name. Very
useful for finding friends! Features: Let's you know of special
events coming up.
	   Before moving, consider filling out your identity. Click on the
link and fill out the form (or the bits you want to fill in). Other
chatters will click on your identity to find out something about
your alias/person. Be as truthful as you like, but remember to stay
in character :-) If you are going to mention your nationality, it
is useful to include a link to a map showing Malaysia. Most
chatters online are Western and most are not sure about Far Eastern
geography.
	   Once you've filled out your identity, move rooms and start
chatting.
	   Don't worry about leaving your private room lying around, eating
up space.
	   When you leave the room it will disappear.
	   When you have finished chatting click on ``Exit'' and leave the
site, your computer will remember who you are, so, if you are
sharing PCs, be sure to log off by clicking on the ``Sign out''
link at the top of the page. Make sure you remember your password
and username. Happy chatting!

	   PRICE Waterhouse executive director Chin Kwai Fatt said
Malaysian companies have the financial and intellectual
capabilities to operate and manage the flow of information
technology (IT) in a competitive business environment.
	   With this he said the introduction of smart cards by financial
institutions was a step in the right direction, as it shows that
innovative technology can be applied to the local environment.
	   However in terms of companies pick up rate towards new IT
technology, Chin said there is a tendency for financial
institutions to be more sensitive to the environment of change,
compared to the manufacturing sector.
	   He added that this is due to the mind set of the companies
itself, and that this can only be overcomed if they are given clear
cut incentives such as tax incentives for embracing new technology.
	   As for electronic commerce (E-Commerce) in a borderless society,
Chin said there should be a clearer picture of the tax implications
on this type of transactions, failing which the growth of
E-Commerce may be impeded.
	   He told this to reporters at a media briefing of Price
Waterhouse's Technology Forecast in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Also present at the briefing was Price Waterhouse director,
strategic technology services Eric M Berg, who said that for this
year the company will distribute 40,000 copies of its Technology
Forecast world-wide of which 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the
copies are for clients of the company.
	   He added that Technology Forecast initially published in 1986
was meant for the internal use of the company but since the last
six years, Price Waterhouse had made copies of the forecast
available to its clients to help them have a clearer understanding
of the changes within the IT industry and its implications to the
business community.
	   Asked if the forecast will be able to improve the bottom-line of
companies especially at a time when the economy is going through a
lacklustre pace, Berg said ``the book is not about buying plans of
business but about the type of technology available in the market
and where the technology will go in the future''.
	   Berg added that companies will be able to have knowledge of new
technology which will be relevant to their business in the future,
thus this will help them prepare their business for the coming of
the IT age.

DO you know that in the cyber community, more than 190 countries

<TEXT>
are represented on the Internet in terms of hosts or domain names?
	   And, according to my source, (http://www.nw.
com/zone/WWW/dist-bynum.html), 40 countries have yet to have their
own Internet domain registered? The findings are interesting.
	   Statistics can be very interesting and very useful. From the
same source, I also learned that after the US (USA), the country
with the most Internet hosts is Japan (jp) with some 1.17 million.
Next comes Germany (de) with almost 995,000 Internet hosts, United
Kingdom (uk) with almost 988,000 Internet hosts and Canada (ca)
with some 839,000 Internet hosts.
	   In contrast, Malaysia (my) can boast of having about 32,000
Internet hosts. Singapore (sg), a much smaller country is somewhat
of a surprise with about 57,000 Internet hosts.
	   Three other Asian nations which come after Japan are Taiwan
(almost 177,000 hosts), Korea (about 122,000 hosts) and Hong Kong
(almost 67,000 hosts).
	   By January 1998, a total of some 29,670,000 hosts had been
determined via the Internet Domain Survey
(http://www.nw.com/zone/WWW.report.html).
	   Compare this with five years ago when in January 1993, there
were only 1,313,000 hosts. In January 1996, there were 9,472,000
hosts according to the survey conducted.
	   There was, however, some discrepancy in the figures in the way
they were derived and this is clearly explained in the document
available at http://www.nw.com/zone/WWW/new-survey.html.
	   Nevertheless, the Internet has definitely grown by leaps and
bounds, not that this knowledge is new to those of us who have been
using the Internet for the past several years! If you wish to
obtain more statistics, visit the Internet Index Home Page at
http://www.openmarket. com/intindex/content.htm. One of the
interesting findings reported for January, 1998 is that the number
of Web users in the US alone is estimated to be 57,037,000.
	   Now, add this figure with numbers for the rest of the world! I
do not have the information but if you do, let me know.
	   It is also expected that the US Census Bureau will be using the
Internet for its population census in the year 2010.
	   Also, almost unbelievable is that there is an estimated 320
million Web pages as of April this year (reported in New York
Times, April 9, 1998)! Now this is a lot of pages. The more
important question is, ``What percentage of the total estimated Web
pages are useful information?''
	   RelevantKnowledge Inc also revealed that in the US, 56 per cent
of Web users are male and that 39 per cent of Web users are between
the ages of 18 and 34 years old.
	   How does this compare locally? We'll have to do some more
research here.
	   I hope there were a few thousand local Internet users who
responded to the online surveys made available (two months ago) at
the Malaysia Homepage and AltaVista Skali Homepage respectively.
	   There is yet another local survey conducted by the Malaysian
Telecommunications Department. Go to http://www.ispsurvey.
gov.my/jtm/ to respond to the online survey. It is available in
both Bahasa Melayu and the English language.
	   The purpose of the survey is to assess the quality of Internet
service provided by Jaring and TMnet. Thus, I urge users to the two
Internet service providers to respond to the survey.
	   The survey questions are organised into two portions. The first
part is to give a quick overall impression of the quality of the
Jaring or TMnet services.
	   The second part of the survey comprises more detailed questions
that are meant to help improve the quality of Internet service to
local users.
	   If you just want to have fun, maybe a site called Irresponsible
Internet Statistics Generator (http://www.ana
morph.com/docs/stats/stats.html) will interest you.
	   The Web Statistics Generator can make an ``irresponsible''
prediction as to the number of Web sites for the date entered. Key
in the Month, Day and Year and you will be able to see their
prediction. You can do the same for the number of people using the
Internet. I must say that while I cannot appreciate the figures
(taking into account that the number of Web sites doubles every 53
days), I appreciate the facility made available.
	   Happy surfing!

MANY accounting software products can be found in local stores.

<TEXT>
This is perhaps testimony to the growth in number of entrepreneurs
in the small office-home office (SOHO) environment.
	   One such accounting product is the Chrysanth Accountant 98 (CA
98). In fact, its user-friendliness and features have been touted
to transform a user from a novice in accounting knowledge and
practice to that of a professional. In essence, CA 98 is designed
based on existing book keeping/double entry system which is widely
used by accounting practitioners. CA 98 will help to create a trial
balance or compile bank reconciliation statements.
	   The CA 98 demonstration copy came in four 3.25-inch floppy
diskettes and was tested on a Pentium 233MHz personal computer (PC)
on Windows 95 with 32 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM).
	   The minimum requirements to run the software are a 486-based
processor, 20MB of hard disk space, Windows 95, 8MB RAM with mouse.
	   Installation was completed without any major technical hiccup.
CA 98 is a full Windows 95-based accounting software. Users can
always refer to Windows 95 Help if there is any doubt during the
installation process.
	   In addition, CA 98 does not consume large resources. A Startup
Wizard appears when the program is launched. This Wizard allows the
user three options; create a new set of accounts, read an overview
of CA 98 or exit the program.
	   The Startup Wizard is designed to guide the user in setting up a
new account. The user will be prompted to fill in statutory
information such as company registered name, address, registration
number and financial year.
	   The Startup Wizard will even correct the user if the user has
inadvertently chosen the length of the financial year greater than
18 months. It creates a new directory to hold each set of account.
	   Function of the Startup Wizard is primarily menu-driven with
dialogue boxes. In addition, the use of tables and icons convey a
non-intimidating look.
	   For example, the main menu is split into several parts. The
left-hand strip holds the various account and report type
functions.
	   The accounts include cash book, petty cash, sales, purchase,
debtors and creditors. The user can also add other accounts which
are not categorised by CA 98 such as discount payable or
receivable, return inwards and outwards.
	   The activity in each account can also be charted. CA 98 offers a
variety of graphical report functions from line graphs to bar and
pie charts. This visual function is useful for accounts management
and exception variance reporting.
	   There are also a strip of set-up icons which allow the user to
create and open an account set. The user can also add, delete, edit
or view the set of accounts from the Account Administration
function.
	   A gem in CA 98 is the project function. This allows the user to
keep track of the revenue and expenditure related to a specific
activity. The user will need to allocate a project code, name,
contracted amount, contractual period and choose the project's
status.
	   The general set-up function allows the user to specify
information for regularly-used remarks, bank reference codes and
departments. These predefined settings is used during transaction
entries.
	   Another gem is the ability of CA 98 to save frequently-entered
words in a reproducible manner. For example, a predefined remark
such as ``LD'' could represent Late Delivery, a predefined bank
code such as ``SCB'' could represent Standard Chartered Bank and a
predefined department such as ``HR''
	   could represent Human Resources. CA 98 will then store these
remarks and allow the user to pick and choose the remarks from a
menu. These functions help in organising a firm's business purpose
and activities.
	   There is also a safety feature in the user privileges section.
This feature accords CA 98's functionality with the status of the
user. The functionalities are like access to ledgers, trial
balance, profit and loss, balance sheet, debtors and creditors
ageing, project costing.
	   One or two users can be assigned the Supervisor status to
administer this security feature. However, Chrysanth recommends
users to appoint only one user with the highest level security
level. Only the Supervisor is given the right to add or withdraw
users into and from the set of accounts in CA 98.
	   Other functions found in the main screen are opening balances,
about and graph analysis.
	   An important element to consider before purchasing CA 98 is the
ease of integrating CA 98 into an existing business. This can
sometimes be a lengthy and painful process.
	   There are two alternatives with CA 98. The first is the
laborious task of re-entering all information front the beginning
of the financial year.
	   Another alternative is to close all accounts in the previous
system, calculate the profit and loss account and transfer the
account balances to CA 98.
	   At the end of the financial year, the user must remember to
include the profit and loss sum from the previous system with the
profit and loss account generated in CA 98.
	   Any CA 98 user will uncover small gems tucked away in the
package. One of them is the Closing Inventory function which allows
the user to enter closing stock values after the customary stock
take.

THE CyberCreative Laboratory (CCL), a unit of Universiti Putra

<TEXT>
Malaysia's (UPM) University Business Centre, has entered into a
collaboration with IT Base Sdn Bhd to extend the scope of its
multimedia-based business activities.
	   Through the alliance, CCL aims to add the production and
distribution of its self-developed multimedia CD-ROM titles to its
existing activities, namely the development of applications,
courseware, human resource, research and services in multimedia.
	   CCL's director Dr Makhdzir Mardan said technopreneurs under IT
Base, which operates about 200 computer training centres (Pusat
Latihan Komputer Belia or PLKB) nationwide under the Youth and
Sports Ministry's auspices, will introduce and use the CD-ROMs in
selected training programmes.
	   ``This way we can gauge the public reaction to our CD-ROMs and
see how effective they are in the edutainment market. It would
provide important input for us before we attempt to put the titles
on the retail market,''
	   Makhdzir told Computimes in Serdang on Monday.
	   He said to date, CCL has more than seven CD-ROM titles in
various stages of development.
	   Targeted at primary and secondary school students, the CD-ROM
titles incorporate content provided by specialist teachers who are
recognised by the Education Ministry.
	   Makhdzir said to test market acceptance CCL will first introduce
Mengetahui Fenomena Fasa-fasa Bulan - a science topic for Level 4
primary school pupils.
	   Developed by multimedia developer Juraidah Muhammad Amin, the
CD-ROM comprises four modules which are simulation, exploration,
assessment and reference.
	   Taking about five months to complete, the CD-ROM which runs on
the Windows 95 and NT platforms was developed using used Authorware
and PhotoShop authoring tools.
	   Besides edutainment multimedia software, CCL also aims to
introduce software in other categories.
	   ``We are also developing an image library solution which we call
Image Bank Service. This is being developed by our software
specialist Marziah Abdul Majid,'' said Makhdzir.
	   According to him, Image Bank Service which can be used to easily
store and retrieve images, is ready for beta testing.
	   ``We will leverage on our relationship with IT Base to test
market acceptance,'' he said.
	   Elaborating on CCL's relationship with IT Base, Makhdzir said
CCL has just finished training 20 technopreneurs in a multimedia
course.
	   ``The participants are only the first batch of technopreneurs
from IT Base. There will be eight more batches to go,'' he said.
	   ``Upon completion of the course, they are now certified to
conduct CCL's Multimedia Jamboree at their respective training
centres. CCL will monitor the quality by doing random checking,''
he added.
	   IT Base, which is under the supervision of project manager
Unisoft Access Sdn Bhd, was set up by the Youth and Sports Ministry
to provide basic computer literacy and Internet familiarisation
courses for youths.
	   The project also serves as an avenue for young entrepreneurs to
get involved in the information technology business.
	   The centres are expected to produce 72,000 youths with certified
basic computer skills annually.

Eritrean forces push Ethiopians back into Ethiopia

	   SERAHA, Eritrea (AP) _ Firing Soviet-era Katyusha rockets and
mortar rounds, Eritrean troops pushed Ethiopian forces back
Thursday along a disputed border area Ethiopia had attacked the day
before.
	   An Eritrean soldier, who would not give his name, claimed most
of the Ethiopian artillery that had shelled the area had been
destroyed.
	   The border area, 135 kms (85 miles) southeast of the capital,
Asmara, has been ill-defined or ignored since Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Eritrea say it respects borders traced by Italy when it seized
Eritrea as a colony in 1885.
	   While residents in Seraha, a settlement built less than two
years ago, often cross into Ethiopia to buy coffee and sugar,
Ethiopian border guards would harass them when they returned home,
an elderly Eritrean man said.
	   Surveying the bullet-scarred walls of a butcher shop, he
concluded that the only solution to the escalating border war
between the two impoverished nations was ``peace-talking.''
	   In the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed Thursday to a four-point proposal put forth by the
United States and Rwanda to end the conflict. One of the points
recommends that Eritrea move back to positions held before May 6,
the date when the latest round of border skirmishes began.
	   The reaction of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to the
proposal was not known.
	   Meles and Isaias were comrades in arms in the struggle to oust
the 17-year military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.
	   In Zala Ambassa, on the Ethiopian side of the border, two
Ethiopian soldiers lay dead in a long trench. Next to them was
Girmay Abade, who had been wounded in both legs Wednesday and could
barely walk.
	   He told the Eritrean troops he was not an Ethiopian soldier,
just a farmer who only the day before had been at a market 20
kilometers (12 miles) away.
	   Close by, an Eritrean family stared out at the soldiers from
their stonewalled house in the Ethiopian town.
	   ``We told them to go back to Eritrea,'' said Eritrean soldier
Tamirat Yohanas.
	   Tamirat said the Ethiopians attacked at dawn Wednesday,
destroying a nearby village.
	   In a makeshift army hospital in Senafe, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
north, 40 wounded Eritreans lay on blankets on the floor. Another
70 sat bandaged in two buses, waiting to move out to Adi Keih, the
next big town up the road toward Asmara.
	   No one was able to say how many Eritreans and Ethiopians had
died in the two days of fighting.

I WILL Corp of Taiwan has announced five new motherboard models

<TEXT>
which boast of significant features such as faster speed and
flexible future upgradable paths for computer users.
	   Three of the new models - the DBL100, DBS100 and BS100 - are
designed for servers while the BD100 and XA100 are intended for
personal computers (PCs).
	   The DBL100 incorporates the Ultra 2 small computer systems
interface (SCSI) technology in its new 100 megahertz (MHz) bus, and
supports dual Intel Pentium II processors that run on faster 100MHz
system bus.
	   It is designed with ATX 2.01 specification form factor and uses
Intel 440BX accelerated graphics port (AGP) set core logic that
supports the Intel 350MHz, 400MHz and also Pentium II processors
based on the 100MHz system bus.
	   The DBS100 model is able to support both dual 100MHz bus Pentium
II processors and dual Adaptec SCSI channels. It comes in an Intel
440BX AGPset core logic which is compliant with ATX 2.01
specification form factor.
	   The DBS100 offers two independent SCSI channels to double the
data transfer rate and to allow more devices connectivity. It is
also able to separate internal and external devices into two
independent SCSI channels.
	   The BS100 server motherboard also adopts almost similar
specification as the previous two except that it only supports one
Pentium II processor with 100 and 66MHz bus.
	   All three server models come with four 168-pin dual in-line
memory module (DIMM) memory sockets, which are able to support
100MHz synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) to match
the memory bandwidth required by the motherboard.
	   The system memory can also be upgraded to one gigabyte (GB).
	   The sockets also supports Serial Presence Detect and Error
Correction Code function for data integrity and reliability. In
order to reduce the Total Cost of Ownership and increase the
manageability, the desktop management interface (DMI)-compliant
BIOS and the hardware health management ASIC are provided to
constantly monitor the voltage and temperature to ensure and allow
preventative maintenance.
	   For the PC version, the BD100 is the latest motherboard that
supports 100MHz bus for one Pentium II processor. It incorporates
Intel 440BX AGPset and is claimed as a breakthrough with its faster
system bandwidth for faster 100MHz PC SDRAM memory.
	   The XA100 motherboard meanwhile is a socket 7 AGP model that is
able to run faster 100MHz bus processors. With this capability, it
can take advantage of the AMD K6 3D chip, Cyrix's and IBM's
processors. The new capability is based on Ali Aladdin V chipset
with 512kilobits faster Level-2 cache and support 100MHz SDRAM with
system memory up to 768MB.
	   All the motherboards come with a one-year warranty.
	   According to Iwill's local distributor Quantum Optimum Sdn Bhd,
an average of 200 motherboards have been sold each month since the
products were introduced earlier this year.
	   Quantum Optimum's manager Sim Chun Hong said to ensure that the
motherboards are available widely, the company plans to appoint
about three to five dealers or system integrators in each State to
push the products. The company expects to sell about 100
motherboards each month.
	   The DBL100, BS100 and BD100 are priced RM2,500, RM1,500, RM800
respectively while the XA100 is offered at RM450.

EXIDE Electronics has announced the Powerware Prime, a new

<TEXT>
three-phase, double conversion online uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) which is specially-designed for centralised power protection
of server, telecommunications and industrial applications.
	   Ranging from 7.5kVA to 15kVA, the UPS which features ABM
functionality is designed to help prolong battery life by up to 50
per cent.
	   With computers becoming centrally located, protecting them
becomes easier and more economical with a larger capacity UPS like
the Powerware Prime, said the company. For computers and devices
located near each other, the Powerware Prime provides protection
for the whole entity with a single UPS.
	   ``The centralised Powerware Prime UPS offers several advantages.
In addition to the cost-savings in power protection, it allows for
future expansion by allowing new devices to be added to the load.
	   ``It also improves manageability by easy configuration of
back-up times for different equipment,'' said Exide Electronics'
director, central Asia sales and marketing, Klaus Thieme.
	   With the Powerware Prime UPS, the company said it is now able to
offer a complete solution for centralised protection.
	   These include a new version of LanSafe III software for
sequential shutdown of the network and the optional PowerVision
software for monitoring of the UPS.

More than 100 killed in clashes in eastern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with report of six soldiers killed in ambush; three
kidnapnned; EDITS to conform.
  By MOHAMED OSMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ More than 100 soldiers were killed in
clashes between Sudanese army and rebels in eastern Sudan over the
past few days, Parliament Speaker Hassan Turabi said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``Sudan sees as martyrs over a hundred persons (killed) during
the past two days in the battles that have taken place in the
southern Blue Nile region,'' Turabi said in a lecture Wednesday
reported in daily Akhbar Al-Youm.
	   Alwan, an independent daily newspaper, reported Thursday that
rebels based in Eritrea ambushed a military truck killing six
soldiers and wounding 20 others in Kassala which is close to the
Eritrean border. It did not say when the ambush took place.
	   The rebels also kidnapped Hamid Fadul al-Moula, a Kassala state
official, and three children. The paper gave no further details.
	   Sudan has accused Eritrea of sheltering southern rebels who seek
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the 15-year old civil war and consequent famines.
	   Sudan's People's Liberation Army said on Wednesday it captured
the garrison town of Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of
Khartoum, in a daylong battle Tuesday. Ulu is 150 kilometers (90
miles) south of the city of Damazin and the Roseires dam, which
provides 80 percent of Khartoum's electricity.
	   But a parliamentary defense committee dismissed the claim.
	   Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha was shown on state-run
television Thursday telling crowds that the military buildup in the
southeast will never harm Sudan.
	   ``We renew the faith and confidence and the backing of the
Sudanese people to the armed forces,'' Taha said.
	   The television also showed hundreds of what it called
Mujahedeen, or holy warriors, being addressed by Col. Ibrahim
Shamsuldin, an adviser to President Omar el-Bashir, before they
headed to battle zones.
	   The Al-Rai Al-Akhar newspaper said el-Bashir and Turabi held
``several hours of meeting'' on the military and political
situation in the country. El-Bashir was quoted in news reports
Wednesday as declaring general military mobilization.
	   Shamsuldin, who rarely appears on television or at rallies, was
speaking to a unit of men in military fatigue wearing red ribbons
tied around their heads, symbol of martyrdom.
	   The Akhbar Al-Youm also quoted Aliga Tobe, the commander of the
Southern Sudan Defense Forces which signed a peace agreement with
the government last year, as saying he expected the rebels to
attack Juba, the largest city in southern Sudan.
	   Tobe said that arrangements were being made to send troops to
battle zones within days from groups that signed treaties with the
government.

Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela to cut oil output by 450,000
</HEADLINE>
barrels

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela
agreed to cut their oil output by 450,000 barrels a day from July
1, the Saudi Oil Ministry said late Thursday.
	   Saudi Arabia promised to cut 225,000 barrels a day, Venezuela by
125,000 and Mexico by 100,000 barrels a day, said a ministry
statement.
	   Oil ministers from the three countries reached the agreement in
Amsterdam, but the announcement was made in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh.
	   Both Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are members of the Organization
of Oil Producing Countries. Mexico is not a member.
	   The three countries agreed on the move because ``the market
remains in a state of imbalance'' the statement said.
	   A deal to trim output in order to raise prices was negotiated by
the three states at a meeting in Riyadh on March 22. Producers
pledged to cut back by some 1.7 million barrels a day. Since then,
prices have risen up to about dlrs 15 a barrel for light sweet
crude in the United States.
	   Some OPEC countries have said they would like to see the prices
go up to dlrs 18 per barrel.
	   Combined with cuts from non-OPEC countries like Norway and
Yemen, the deal removed about 1.5 million barrels a day from the
world oil supply.
	   Thursday's statement said the three countries will contact other
OPEC and non-OPEC members to ``reach further cutbacks in the
production above the levels agreed upon in March 1998.''

INTEL Corp has launched its new 266 megahertz (MHz) Celeron

<TEXT>
processor which is targeted at the low-cost home and business PC
market. Celeron is an attempt by the company to produce processors
which are tailored to specific market segments, rather than their
previous one-for-all processor solutions.
	   According to Intel, the Celeron is best suited for the ``Basic
PC'', which is defined as a personal computer which ranges from
RM2,800 to RM3,500.
	   Fashioned to provide a base level of functionality, the 266MHz
Celeron processor is capable of running Windows 95, NT and even
Unix applications.
	   The Celeron is a sixth generation (P6) processor, compared to
the older fifth generation Pentium MMX range from Intel.
	   Intel claims that they are thus capable of higher speeds (to be
introduced later) and consume less power. The chip uses the Intel
440EX AGPset, which is more feature-limited and thus a more
cost-efficient version of the Intel 440LX AGPset, used for the PII.
	   The Celeron processor comes in an ``exposed'' Single Edge
Processor Package (SEPP), similar to but without the black outer
casing like the Single Edge Cartridge (SEC) packaging of the PII.
Nevertheless, a drawback of the Celeron is that it doesn't have any
L2 secondary cache memory.
	   With regard to some unfavourable reports on Celeron's
performance, Intel said the reports focused only on the Celeron's
integer performance and not the three vectors - integer, multimedia
and floating point regions that determine the overall performance
of a chip. Intel claimed a Celeron purchase would be a good move by
PC users as they would have extra headroom to further upgrade to a
Pentium II system via Celeron.

MILLENNIUM Technology Sdn Bhd has introduced its human resource

<TEXT>
program, the Millennium HR System, which is designed to enhance
local companies' HR management at an affordable cost.
	   This locally-developed package consists of Payroll, Human
Resource Documentation, Security and Leave Management modules, and
is specially designed with features needed by local companies.
	   According to Millennium's director and marketing manager Francis
Yee, the package is it is designed to boost productivity with easy
data entry and a comprehensive report coverage.
	   ``The program provides benefits like flexible user definition,
user friendly Windows interface and is scalable from standalone
personal computers (PCs) to multi-user LANs.''
	   The Human Resource Documentation module is the core of the
package. It facilitates the storage of personal, family, salary and
employment information. It also allows users to generate data for
employees recruited, due for confirmation or resigned, during a
user specified data range.
	   The data is used for merging with standard letters and forms
created using word processors like Microsoft Word. Such documents
include letters and forms for appointments, confirmations,
probation extensions, bonus notice, Socso Form 2 and 3 and Inland
Revenue Board's CP22 and CP22A.
	   The Payroll module extracts the employment data from the HR Doc
module and handles all your payroll requirements, right from
computation of overtime, allowances, deductions to the generation
of pay slips, the submission forms for IRB CP39, EA, E form, CP159,
EPF Form 8A and Socso Form A.
	   The system also supports features like Bank AutoPay, submission
via diskettes for EPF, Socso and Income Tax Schedular Tax
Deduction.
	   The third module, Leave Management, allows users to keep track
of annual leave entitlement, applications and the balance for each
of the employees electronically.
	   ``One unique thing about the Payroll feature is that users are
allowed to rerun it as many times as they want. Usually, this
capability is not found in other payroll packages,'' Yee told
Computimes.
	   In addition to the annual leave, users are also allowed to
define various leave types, such as medical, Socso, marriage,
unpaid, study as practised by the company.
	   The system is also designed to facilitate mass data entry such
as the annual leave initialisation to be brought forward to the
following year. ``For the Leave module, we designed it to be open
because certain companies have different ways of handling leave,''
Yee said.
	   He added that a Security module is incorporated to prevent
unauthorised access and allow users to define confidential
information.
	   ``Security-wise, there are three levels of authentication. These
are module access, program and record.''
	   The basic system requirements needed to run the software include
a 386- based PC with Windows 3.1 and four megabytes (MB) of random
access memory (RAM). Higher PC specifications with Windows 95
version is also supported.
	   The package is targeted at all types of companies regardless of
the size as it comes with a very affordable pricing.
	   The company is projecting about 500 customers by the end of the
year for the package. According to Yee, a large portion may come
from the standalone version.
	   The pricing for a standalone version starts from RM800 to
RM2,450 depending on the number of users supported, while for the
LAN version, the pricing for one workstation starts at RM2,100.
	   The standalone package includes training which costs around
RM300.
	   An additional RM300 installation fee is required for the LAN
version.

AS we are approaching the end of this century, the geographical

<TEXT>
boundaries that separate us from one another seem to be blur.
	   Aeroplanes and ships have made travelling much easier and faster
while the mail system has enabled us to exchange and receive
information in a matter of weeks.
	   Telephones have contributed to this by allowing us to make calls
to our loved ones. The availability of cable and satellite
televisions has further helped disseminate information and news to
global communities.
	   Information that used to be privy to someone in the United
States, for instance, is now available to another person in
Malaysia.
	   The multimedia explosion and the convergence of the personal
computers (PCs) and the telephones have further helped us send and
receive information quickly and efficiently. The advent of the
Internet, meanwhile, has created a global village among us, where
boundaries are not defined by tangible limits, but only by the
level of knowledge and technical skills of the individual.
	   With the Internet being accessed by everyone from information
technology (IT) managers, students, housewives to children, the
amount of resources available to them is vast and available at the
cost of a telephone call.
	   The Internet technology has been developed to the extent that
multiple media elements such as graphics, text, sound, animation
and digital video can now be delivered from one computer and played
back on another computer at any location within seconds.
	   The World Wide Web and its user-friendly graphics interfaces
have enabled multimedia developers to create contents for the
worldwide community. Many businesses have taken the advantage of
the information available in cyberspace to gain a competitive edge.
	   As getting wired to the Internet is relatively easy (just have a
computer with a modem and get yourself an Internet account with and
Internet service providers), many opportunities have surfaced to
suit the varying industries that use the Web. Among these
opportunities are electronic commerce (e-commerce), online
tutorials or training programmes.
	   E-commerce: In e-commerce, companies will utilise various
services such as electronic mail (e-mail) and chat software in
order to reach buyers from all over the world.
	   Many companies are, in fact, beginning to use Internet chat
techniques and message boards tos e-commerce and online training,
the Web also plays an important role in education. With the many
search engines available, the Web is a library of sorts for
students wanting to find information on a particular topic.
	   Using the Web in learning processes has changed teachers' role
as not only as educators, but also facilitators.
	   Assuming the role as facilitators, the teachers need to find
ways as how students can look at the Web as a fun and an exciting
thing, and be informed on the sources of the information. The
teachers can use the Web for many things such as conducting online
field trips and simulation. If the school has Internet access, the
teachers can take students to various sites that they cannot go or
provide them with materials which are not available in the
classroom. A trip to the Louvre museum (http://mistral.
	   culture.fr/louvre), for example, may be out of many students'
means.
	   However, with the Web, the whole class can visit the museum at
the cost of a telephone call.
	   Similarly, the students can be provided with online simulations
and problem-solving activities related to with their curriculum.
With the ability of the Web to incorporate interactive multimedia
applications, getting around their way on the Internet can make
their learning more dynamic and interesting. The Web is definitely
a fascinating environment for information exchange.
	   As the Internet technology is continuously developing, there is
no doubt that we can only see the benefits in the long run.

OF the many military planes simulated in computer games, the

<TEXT>
F-15E has got to be the least simulated of the lot. Most of us have
seen or flew Tomcats, Falcons, Hornets right to Flankers and even
futuristic ATFs like the F-22 Raptor but the last time we had a
ride on the Strike Eagle was way back when Microprose released F-15
Strike Eagle III.
	   That was more than half a decade ago and fortunately Andy
Hollis, the same guy who brought you the aforementioned game, has
produced yet another flight simulation gem on the Strike Eagle,
Jane's F-15. The F-15 Eagle was designed back in early 70s and has
seen many changes with the most recent being the E version (not
counting the various export versions). Primarily used as a fighter,
the E version however was refitted with various enhancements to
allow another role - ground strike, hence its name the Strike
Eagle.
	   In Jane's latest flight simulation game, the Strike Eagle will
be the plane you'll be flying around, delivering death and
destruction. In tradition with all Jane's Combat Simulations
titles, F-15 features a wealth of detail and close to reality
controls and interface.
	   F-15 can be played in two modes - the casual mode and the expert
mode.
	   In the casual mode, controls of the Strike Eagle are very much
simplified and most of the push buttons and multi-purpose displays
(MPDs) in the F-15 aren't used. This mode caters for casual gamers
who are more of those trigger-happy pilots than real flight
simulation aficionados. Even so, the game isn't as easy as it ought
to be - there are still plenty of details and controls you'll need
to remember. You can't actually grab the joystick and go shoot
every plane down in a single go. Of course, you may try but most of
the time, you'll end up dead or pretty shot up.
	   For the expert mode, you'll be in the hot seat of a real F-15E
with tons of controls to handle. The MPDs and analogue displays in
the cockpit throw so much information at you; you'll either need to
have an incredible memory or a fighter pilot's instincts to
decipher each and every one of them.
	   Just imagine this scenario: the head-up display (HUD) is gone,
so you'll need to refer to the analogue dials and displays at the
bottom of the cockpit.
	   The left MPD is set to A/A (air-to-air) radar mode, pretty
cluttered up with so many plane signals, you can hardly discern one
from another. At the same time, the right MPD is set to the
Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) which is used to show all
threats like launch radars and plane radars and most importantly,
radars that have spotted you and sending up a couple of Surface to
Air Missiles (SAMs) towards you.
	   These threats emit a high-low pitched warble that is most
distressing.
	   Add to that your Weapons System Officer (WSO) or `Wizzo' is
screaming at the top of his lungs asking you to break left to avoid
a SAM coming up your six (right behind you), and you'll have
nothing but admiration for those fighter pilots who handle these
sort of things day in and day out.
	   Each and every push buttons, toggles and switches can be
activated, pressed or toggled and you still need to contend
yourself with the incredibly accurate flight model.
	   It would seems like every thing you do in the F-15 require you
to follow a certain procedure. In the real world, fighter pilots
usually have checklists for this but in computer simulations,
checklists are pretty much make-yourself affair.
	   For example, eventhough it's recommended that I activate the
Instrument Landing System (ILS) before attempting to land, I
usually rely heavily on visual cues to land my plane. This is
actually no good especially when it comes to landing at night or in
adverse weather conditions. Anyway, Jane's F-15 is divided into
several game sections which are pretty common among flight
simulation games, namely campaign, single mission, multiplayer
game, instant action and training. A nice addition (although
nothing new in Jane's Combat Simulation series) would be the
reference section.
	   Featuring a list of planes and weapons found in the game, each
one of the military hardwares is provided with loads of information
straight from Jane's Information Group. You can check out the
features added to RMAF's Mig-29s and F-18s.
	   For the campaign option, there are only two available, Operation
Desert Storm and a hypothetical Iran campaign. Since both are in
the vicinity of another and both are in the Middle East, most of
the background terrain you'll be flying over will be desert and
occasionally the ocean.
	   The single mission option is pretty straightforward and can be
summarised to three ``Gets'' - Get in, Get the job done and Get the
heck out. Instant action allows you to get into the cockpit and
start shooting without going through all the stuff in the manual
(although you wouldn't last long). All the missions are created by
the computer but you can set certain parameters of the missions to
suit your taste like setting the computer-controlled planes to be
flown by morons instead of ace pilots or let the same planes fly
without any weapons. Multi-player games are available via serial
and modem connections, IPX/SPX protocol network and TCP/IP through
Internet connection.
	   The network and Internet options allow up to eight players to
blow each other out of the sky in furball matches. Unfortunately,
there aren't any co-operation missions available, only co-op
furballs.
	   Graphic-wise, F-15 has got to be one of the best-looking flight
simulation games around (except for Long Bow 2). With a 3Dfx card
present and the graphical effects all cranked up, the planes looked
fantastic.
	   Smoke trails, night vision, glowing tracers, sun glare and
stunning visual effects make F-15 a graphical feast for the eyes.
	   Unfortunately, the beautiful graphics come with a high price -
frame rates. To have a decent sustained frame rates (enough to
avoid jerky screens); you can either lower down certain effects or
get a monster of a machine. A Pentium II machine rigged with a
Voodoo 2 graphic card ought to do the trick. In the sound
department, there aren't many tunes around (the techno tunes are
pretty exciting though) but the sound effects are sufficient by
far. Nothing to shout about here.
	   If the missions aren't enough, you can design your own using the
included mission builder. This mission builder is quite exclusive
and elaborate since the mission designers themselves use it to
create missions for the game.
	   All in all, Jane's F-15 is an impressive game despite its
difficult learning curve. The beautiful graphics coupled with the
accurate flight model ought to get serious flight buffs excited.
Highly recommended.

South Africa, Sierra Leone to establish diplomatic relations
</HEADLINE>
  EDS: CORRECTS overline to remove erroneous reference to Burkina
Faso, CORRECTS throughout that Sierra Leone government has already
been restored to power.  

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa will recognize Sierra
Leone's newly reinstalled government, a foreign affairs statement
said Thursday.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo met Thursday with his counterpart
from Sierra Leone, Shama Banya, at an Organization of African Unity
meeting in Burkina Faso.
	   The statement said South Africa would open diplomatic relations
with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government _ elected in 1996,
ousted in a coup last May then reinstalled earlier this year _
after ``necessary formalities'' had been completed. It was not
clear what the formalities were.
	   South Africa was one of the first countries to condemn last
May's military coup.
	   ``Let it be a signal to others that Africa will continue to
reject the illegal seizure of power from governments who have been
democratically elected,'' Nzo said.
	   Nzo said South Africa would provide humanitarian assistance to
the war-torn country
	   Kabbah returned to govern Sierra Leone in March after a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force drove the rebel forces
out of the capital, Freetown, and most major towns.

IN the last 10 years, voice mail technology has gained its

<TEXT>
popularity in every business sector. In the hospitality industry,
in particular, voice mail has become a norm in most hotels
irrespective of their star rating.
	   The hotel voice mail system provides high-performance
capabilities.
	   Fully integrated with the front-office host system which
facilitates guest mailboxes to be allocated when guests check in
and unallocated when guests check out.
	   The front desk can also define a guest's language as all hotel
voice mail systems support multiple languages.
	   Furthermore, a guest can protect his/her mailbox with a
self-defined password and each guest can record a personal greeting
that can be heard when someone leaves a message.
	   The hospitality voicemail provides the following general
features: Personal greeting: Extending the home-away-from-home
concept, the guest can record his/her name as well as a short
message. The caller will be greeted with this personal message when
the guest is not in.
	   Message time stamp: To ensure messages are received timely and
accurately, every message that arrives in the mailbox is stamped
with a date and time.
	   Delete all messages heard: By simply pressing a button, the
guest can delete all messages that have been heard.
	   Message security: To ensure confidentiality of voicemail, an
individually-chosen password protects access to a guest's mailbox.
	   Guests can modify their personal password at any time and in the
event that the password is forgotten, the operator will be able to
reassign a new password.
	   Notification of text/fax message: The system will automatically
announce the number of texts, faxes and voice messages when the
guest logs into his/her mailbox.
	   Message waiting indication: The light on the telephone set will
be activated if there is a voice message for the guest. After the
voice message has been read by the guest, the light will be turned
off.
	   Moving of room: When a guest changes room, his mailbox can be
moved with him without loss of data or messages.
	   After check-out: Extending the hotel's services to a guest even
after check-out, guests can still check their mailbox for
information that they may require.
	   Broadcast messages from front office personnel: To reduce the
administrative workload of tour guides, messages can be broadcast
to the guests in the same tour group. However, for security
reasons, this feature will only be restricted to the hotel staff.
	   Voice information tree: A vocal information tree may be created
to inform the guest of any hotel activity. The caller needs only to
select the information that he/she wishes to hear by dialling the
selection from the voice menu.
	   Unified messaging: The advancement of the voicemail technology
has allowed the integration of voice, fax and e-mail into a single
platform.
	   As such, a guest can have all the options at their disposal when
they check into a hotel providing such facilities.

BAY Networks has announced that it will increase its channel

<TEXT>
partners and embark on a branding campaign to increase awareness of
its presence in the Asian market.
	   The company's vice president for corporate marketing Grace Carr
said that Bay Networks has benefited from its current marketing
campaign in North America and hopes to emulate this success in
Asia.
	   ``Studies have shown that customers buying decisions are often
based on brand consciousness and is independent of quality,'' said
Carr in Las Vegas recently.
	   Its North American marketing campaign consisted of television
advertisements and publicity generated by the business and
computing Press.
	   Carr added that the company will focus its efforts first on
China, which is a major growth market for Bay Networks.
	   However, the company hopes to be able to extend its branding
exercise to Malaysia by the second half of this year.
	   Bay Networks also intends to appoint more channel partners in
Malaysia.
	   ``We will be more aggressive in recruiting volume partners which
will target small to medium-sized companies,'' revealed Bay
Networks Southeast Asia Pte Ltd's public relations manager, Annette
MacDougall.
	   Currently, 60 to 70 per cent of Bay Networks' channel partners
are made up of systems integrators.

BAY Networks Inc introduced Accelar 1050 switch, which delivers

<TEXT>
application intelligence at the edge during the recent
Networld+Interop exhibition in Las Vegas, US.
	   According to its vice president of product management for the
switching products division Basil Alwan, devices that allow
end-to-end application intelligence are the latest trend in
networking equipment. ``Application- intelligent devices ensure
predictability and reliability for business' critical information
flow. They eliminate the effects of congestion on business-critical
applications and make networks resilient to failure,''
	   Alwan said.
	   The devices are also able to conduct deep-packet filtering
giving networks the ability to forward and filter network traffic.
	   ``The hardware prioritises business-critical information over
generic data and delay sensitive applications,'' Alwan said.
	   Applications that incorporate voice and video capabilities would
fall into the latter category.
	   Alwan claimed that most Ethernet networks exist today only
incorporate application intelligence at the Layer-3 level of the
network. There is usually no application intelligence at the
Layer-2 level, he said.
	   The Accelar 1050 is designed for use at the layer-2 level and
extends application intelligence to the edge of the network.
	   ``And it is able to provide this functionality at a price point
that will enable customers to economically build networks optimised
for business-critical applications,'' Alwan said.
	   The Accelar 1050 routing switch is available in both modular and
stackable formats. When aggregated with existing systems such as
the BayStack 350T-HD switch, per port costing for the stackable
Accelar 1050 is estimated at US$193 (RM735).
	   The modular version comes at a higher price point of US$376 per
port. A router is not required when the Accelar routing switch is
combined with a Layer-2 desktop switch.
	   The 1050 model is also less costly than the existing Accelar
1000 products although it is based on the same distributed hardware
architecture, according to Bay Networks.
	   The Accelar 1050 standalone fixed configuration unit comes with
12 autosensing 10/100Base TX ports for server and workstation
attachments and a single 1000Base-SX Gigabit Ethernet port for
server connectivity.
	   It is expected to be deployed in server farms where it is
crucial to accelerate inter-subnet traffic to centralised servers
for improved system performance. It is also suitable for use in the
wiring closet.
	   The product, which is expected to start shipping next month,
carries a list price of US$7,495.
	   A second model, the Accelar 1051 routing switch which includes a
LinkSafe redundant physical connection for the 1000Base-SX
connection, is also expected to begin shipping next month. The 1051
model is priced at US$8,250.
	   The product should be available locally through Bay Networks'
business partners and volume distributors.

IMPIANAS Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lityan Holdings

<TEXT>
Bhd, is set to roll out the first of its three-phase public mobile
data network project by the end of this month.
	   Under the first phase, the company will install a radio network
management centre (RNMC) and six base stations.
	   According to Impianas' general manager Ismail Yahya, one pilot
base station was successfully installed at Radisson Hotel in Shah
Alam, and five more will follow suit at Port Klang, Petaling Jaya,
Sri Petaling and Pudu and Jalan Tun Razak in Kuala Lumpur.
	   He added that although the initial plan was for Impianas to
install 25 base stations within the Klang Valley for the network's
scheduled launch in July, the pilot has established that six base
stations are sufficient to complete the coverage for the entire
Klang Valley.
	   ``Initially, we will be concentrating on pioneering the six base
stations to gauge the signal strength in and around the Klang
Valley as well as inside buildings.'' Ismail said in Shah Alam last
week.
	   ``We are trying to maximise our capital investment and, as such,
there is no point in deploying base stations at places which have
no coverage. If the demand requires and there are any blind spots
to fill, then will we add base stations,'' he added.
	   Some applications that have been successfully running under the
pilot include a ticketing solution from Ticketing Express and a
messaging solution from Adaptive Micro Systems.
	   Ismail said of the RM60 million total investment, between 40 and
60 per cent had been allocated for the first phase while the
balance would be utilised for the other two phases.
	   The pricing structure for the network, he added, has been set
``using price as the positioning factor and thus is very
competitive''.
	   The tariff will vary according to users' requirements and the
applications.
	   By the end of this year, Impianas is targeting to secure between
1,800 and 2,400 subscribers.
	   With the implementation of phase two, the company hopes to
attract an additional 4,200 subscribers and another 4,800 in the
third year to reach more than 10,000 subscribers in total by the
year 2000 when the network is expected to be fully operational.
	   Phase two of the project is scheduled to be implemented next
year covering Penang, Johor and the North-South Highway, while the
final phase is expected to be implemented in the year 2000.
	   The last phase will cover the East Coast States, Sabah and
Sarawak.
	   Impianas, which was incorporated for the sole purpose of
installing, managing and providing wireless data communication
services in Malaysia, was granted a 10-year operating licence by
the Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Ministry last November to
carry out its activities.
	   The network which is positioned to cater for short bursty
transactions such as short messaging, vehicle tracking and
utilities metering, is targeted at corporate customers primarily
from the retail sector, finance and security, transportation and
utility industries and the mass market.

  Eds: Adds more Hartwig quotes, more details

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France (AP) - Jeff Hartwig set a American pole vault
record Thursday, bettering 6.00 meters (19 feet, 8 1/4 inches) at
the St. Denis international track meet.
	   Hartwig bettered the previous mark of 5.98 meters (19-7 1/2) set
in May. 1996 by Lawrence Johnson.
	   Hartwig became the eighth vaulter in history to clear the metric
barrier of 6.00. He compared the 6.00 barrier to pole vaulters is
like the 4 minute mile in on the track.
	   ``All the vaulters are chasing that mark. There are about seven
Americans over 19 feet in the vault but only one over 6 meters,''
Hartwig said. .''
	   Sergi Bubka has the outdoor record of 6.14. Others over 6.00 are
Russians Igor Trandenkov, Rodion Gautallin Maxim Tarasov and Dmitri
Markov. Also South Africa's Okert Brits and Germany's Tim Lobinger.
	   Hartwig, a 30-year-old from Arkansas State and Jonesboro,
Arkansas , had a good series, starting at 5.55 and then clearing
5.70 meters, 5.8 and 5.9 on his second attempt.
	   He missed twice at 6.00 then went over on his third attempt,
hitting the bar on his way over.
	   ``I was close on my first two attempts and I thought I have to
be patient with the jump and make things happen,'' Hartwig said. ``
I stayed with the pole to get all the energy on my third jump and
went right over it.''
	   Hartwig's last year was 5.85. although he did 5.86 indoors this
year and added a 5.92 at the Prefontaine meet in Oregon where he
tried 6.00 for the first time.
	   ``That is one of the most difficult things to do is having the
opportunity to jump 6 meters in competition,'' Hartwig said. ``Once
I did 5.86 indoors and 5.90 down in Australia, it was only 10
centimeters or four inches. I tried to keep it out of my mind that
it was 6 meters or an American record. I just look at it as if it's
the next height.''
	   Hartwig said it was the fourth time he tried six meters this
year.
	   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who took over the crown as the
top middle distance runner in the world last year, won the 1,500
meters Thursday at the St. Denis international athletics meeting.
	   El Guerrouj's time, 3 minutes, 32.34 seconds, was far from his
best. He had four races under 3:30 last year.
	   However it was just his second race of the season. He did
3:31.18 but it was overshadowed Monday by a world record in the
10,000 by Haile Gebrselassie
	   The 24-year-old El Guerrouj was known for his fall entering the
final lap at the Atlanta Olympics 1,500 giving the title to
Noureddine Morceli, who had dominated the distance for nearly 6
years.
	   In 1997 El Guerrouj finally overtook Morceli, taking the world
championship and being unbeaten for the season and setting world
records at two distances indoor.
	   El Guerrouj has sparked a running revival in Morocco, where Said
Aouita ruled in the mid 1980s. Moroccan women took the 800 and
5,000 o Thursday.
	   Hasna Benhassi took the women's 800 in 1:59.71, the first time
under 2:00 for the 20-year-old. Also Salah Hissou won the men's
5.000.
	   Two-time world cross-country champion Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland was soundly beaten in her 5,000 race, coming in third
behind Zohra Ouaziz of Morocco and Gete Wami of Ethiopia.
	   O'Sullivan won both the long and short distance races in a
double at the world cross country meet in Morocco in March.
	   ``It's still the beginning of the season,'' O'Sullican said. ``I
want to do the 1,500. My goal is to win the Europeans in Budapest.
The other competitions are just practice races.''
	   Ouaziz ran a season best 14:42.11 with O'Sullivan doing 15:03.76
	   Ouaziz found the conditions tough.
	   ``I had problems with the windy weather,'' Ouaziz said. ``I was
afraid to take off. It's a pity. We both could have gone under
14:40.
	   Christine Aaron of France, fresh from a 10.95 last week,
confirmed her timing with a 10.99 victory.
	   Former world champion Samuel Matete of Zambia took the 400
hurdles in 48.90. He found the conditions difficult.
	   ``It went well but there's a lot of wind,'' Matete said. ``Te
time wasn't brilliant. I've done 48.32.''
	   The women's 400 hurdles went to Olympic champion Deon Hemmings
of Jamaica, 54.21, beating 1995 world champion Kim Batten of the
United States,

Nuclear club refuses to admit India, Pakistan, nations call for
</HEADLINE>
  RETRANSMITS
talks
  Eds: UPDATES with new Albright, Tang quotes from news conference.
  By JOHN DIAMOND  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The five longstanding nuclear states refused
Thursday to admit India or Pakistan into the nuclear club and
called on them to refrain from further nuclear tests and resolve
their differences with direct talks.
	   Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, Britain and
France, at an emergency meeting to deal with the South Asian arms
race, also promised to assist in cooling tension between India and
Pakistan and called upon them to ``avoid threatening military
movements, cross-border violations or other provocative acts.''
	   ``We are prepared to help India and pakistan maintain peace if
they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   ``It is a strong message from the permanent members of the
Security Council and they'd better stop, look, and listen,'' she
said.
	   ``The ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep
concern about the danger to peace and stability in the region, and
pledged to cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear
and missile arms race in the subcontinent,'' the powers stated in a
joint communique.
	   In rejecting the South Asian nations' bid to join the ranks of
nuclear powers, the five nations said after a two-hour meeting:
	   ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons
states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.''
	   India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to
export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to
weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them,
the communique said.
	   The leaders underscored the urgency of India and Pakistan
rejoining the global arms-control movement they sent staggering
last month when India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons
tests.
	   Specifically, they urged both nations to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty unconditionally _ meaning without any ``rewards''
such as permanent status on the U.N. Security Council or any
changes in the obligations the treaty imposes on nuclear powers.
	   Conspicuously missing from the communique was any mention of
either sanctions or incentives designed to persuade India and
Pakistan to step back from their nuclear standoff.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the communique from
the major nuclear powers would not instantly change the behavior of
India or Pakistan. He quoted a Chinese proverb: ``It is up to the
one who tied the knot to untie it.''
	   Tang opened the meeting by saying the nations are united in
calling on India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear
testing and pull back from an incipient arms race.
	   ``Tension in the region is mounting,'' Tang said. ``The
permanent members of the (U.N.) Security Council bear important
responsibility toward world peace and stability.'' He said the
purpose of the meeting was ``to channel our joint efforts to arrest
the nuclear arms race in South Asia.''
	   Albright, who called the meeting at U.N. offices here, met
separately with Tang and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
before diplomats from the five powers convened to approve the joint
communique on the India-Pakistan crisis.
	   U.S. officials said a key concern of Albright was making sure
the traditional Russian tilt toward India and Chinese support for
Pakistan do not prevent the five powers from producing a strong
joint statement.
	   Tang hinted at the Chinese inclination toward Pakistan in his
description of the events of the past month.
	   ``In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went
ahead with its nuclear tests,'' Tang said. ``After the peace and
stability in the South Asian region had been undermined, Pakistan
also carried out nuclear tests.''
	   Despite differing perspectives, the five nations adopted a
united stance.

Kosovo Albanians pull out of talks, condemn Serb offensive
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with British premier saying EU considering sanctions
to stop Kosovo fighting.  
  With Albania-Kosovo  
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian officials pulled out
of talks with the Serbian government Thursday, demanding a halt to
the fierce offensive that has devastated villages and sent tens of
thousands fleeing in Kosovo province.
	   Serbs, meanwhile, said a police and Yugoslav army assault across
western Kosovo was a protective sweep against separatist guerrillas
in the Serb-ruled province where ethnic Albanians comprise the
majority.
	   ``All our actions are defensive in character,'' insisted Veljko
Odalovic, the top Serbian government official in Kosovo. ``We are
simply responding to attacks by terrorists.''
	   Ethnic Albanians say dozens of villagers have been killed and
tens of thousands of people are hiding in forests in the
independence-minded province of southern Serbia, waiting for a
chance to escape to neighboring Albania.
	   An estimated 12,000 people have crossed into Albania, the
Albanian Interior Ministry said.
	   As many as 7,000 others have fled into Montenegro, the other
republic left in what remains of Yugoslavia besides Serbia,
Montenegrin officials said.
	   The Albanian government, worried about the crush of refugees and
a new threat for its strapped military in Europe's poorest country,
is pushing for Western troops to shore up its northern border _ a
request NATO is considering warily.
	   ``We expect everything from the Serbs, even to hunt down the
rebels in our territory or to do something else, much graver,''
Vladimir Prela, political adviser to Premier Fatos Nano, said in
the Albanian capital Tirana.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said the European Union was mulling how to stop the fighting in
Kosovo. He said discussions included talk of sanctions but refused
to elaborate. Britain currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.

Communique of the 5 nuclear powers on India-Pakistan tests
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   The joint communique issued Thursday by the five longstanding
nuclear powers on the India-Pakistan nuclear tests:
	     ___
	   1. Bearing in mind the responsibility of their countries for the
maintenance of international peace and security, the foreign
ministers of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the
United States met in Geneva on June 4, 1998, to coordinate their
response to the grave situation created by the nuclear tests
carried out in May 1998 by India and then by Pakistan. The
ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep concern about
the danger to peace and stability in the region and pledged to
cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear and
missile arms race in the Subcontinent, to bolster the
nonproliferation regime and to encourage reconciliation and
peaceful resolution of differences between India and Pakistan.
	   2. The ministers agreed that quick action is needed to arrest
the further escalation of regional tensions stimulated by the
recent nuclear tests. India and Pakistan should therefore stop all
further such tests. They should refrain from the weaponization or
deployment of nuclear weapons, from the testing or deployment of
missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and from any further
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. They should
also halt provocative statements, refrain from any military
movements that could be construed as threatening and increase
transparency in their actions. Direct communications between the
parties could help to build confidence.
	   3. To reinforce security and stability in the region and more
widely, the five strongly believe that Indian and Pakistan should
adhere to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty immediately and
unconditionally, thereby facilitating its early entry into force.
The five also call upon India and Pakistan to participate in a
positive spirit and on the basis of the agreed mandate, in
negotiations with other states in the Conference on Disarmament for
a Fissile Material Cut-off convention with a view to reaching early
agreement. The five will seek firm commitments by India and
Pakistan not to weaponize or deploy nuclear weapons or missiles.
India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to export
equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to weapons
of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them, and
should undertake appropriate commitments in that regard.
	   4. The ministers agreed that the international nonproliferation
regime must remain strong and effective despite the recent nuclear
tests in South Asia. Their goal continues to be adherence by all
countries, including India and Pakistan, to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as it stands, without any
modification. This treaty is the cornerstone of the
nonproliferation regime and the essential foundation for the
pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Notwithstanding their recent
nuclear tests, India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear
weapons states in accordance with the NPT.
	   5. The ministers concluded that efforts to resolve disputes
between India and Pakistan must be pursued with determination. The
ministers affirm their readiness to assist India and Pakistan, in a
manner acceptable to both sides, in promoting reconciliation and
cooperation. The ministers pledged that they will actively
encourage India and Pakistan to find mutually acceptable solutions,
through direct dialogue, that address the root causes of the
tension, including Kashmir, and to try to build confidence rather
than seek confrontation. In that connection, the ministers urged
both parties to avoid threatening military movements, cross-border
violations or other provocative acts.
	   6. The ministers also considered what actions the five could
take, individually or collectively, to foster peace and security in
South Asia. They will encourage India and Pakistan to adopt
practical measures to prevent an arms race. They confirmed their
respective policies to prevent the export of equipment, materials
or technology that could in any way assist programs in India or
Pakistan for nuclear weapons or for ballistic missiles capable of
delivering such weapons. They also undertook to do all they could
to facilitate a reduction of tensions between those states and to
provide assistance, at the request of both parties, in the
development and implementation of confidence- and security-building
measures. They remain determined to fulfill their commitments
relating to nuclear disarmament under Article VI of the NPT.
	   7. The ministers viewed their meeting in Geneva as setting in
motion a process aimed at strengthening peace and stability in
South Asia, at encouraging restraint by India and Pakistan, at
promoting the resolution of outstanding differences and at
bolstering the international nonproliferation regime. They will
remain fully engaged in pursuing these goals and will work actively
to build broad support in the international community for the
objectives they agreed today.

Last-minute Salas goal gives Chile 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTELIMAR, France (AP) _ Marcelo Salas knocked in a header in
the 90th minute to give Chile a 1-1 draw with Morocco Thursday
night in the last tune-up match for both World Cup-bound teams.
	   Salas got his head onto a cross from Marcelo Vega to beat
Moroccan keeper Abdelkader el-Brazi, giving Chile the draw in a
mediocre showing by both teams.
	   Mustapha Hadji gave Morocco the lead in the 61st minute, when
his blast from inside the area beat Chilean keeper Marcelo Ramirez.
	   Both sides used many reserves. For most of the match, Chile used
only two regulars: Ronald Fuentes and Pedro Reyes.
	   Salas and striking partner Ivan Zamorano both entered the game
for Chile three minutes after Hadji's goal, restoring a more
familiar look to the side.
	   After an initial spurt by Chile, Morocco was able to take
control and began creating scoring opportunities in the Chilean
penalty area.
	   Ramirez had to deflect a header from Taher el-Khalej in the 26th
minute, and Hadji had another opportunity but shot wide.
	   Chile's only chance in the first half came from Manuel Neira,
who missed an open goal after catching Moroccan keeper Driss
Benzekri off his line.
	   Morocco continued to contol the possession in the second half,
but failed to convert it into quality chances.
	   French referee Bernard Saules disallowed one Chilean goal by
Rodrigo Barrera for offside by French referee.
	   ___  
  Lineups  
	   Chile: Marcelo Ramirez, Ronald Fuentes, Cristian Castaneda,
Pedro Reyes, Miguel Ramirez, Mauricio Aros, Clarence Acuna (Fabian
Estay, 83rd minute), Fernando Cornejo, Jose Luis Sierra (Marcelo
Vega, 46th), Manuel Neira (Ivan Zamorano, 64th), Rodrigo Barrera
(Marcelo Salas, 64th).

Hopes for an Arab summit fade as Egypt, Syria express reservations
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with U.S. urging Arabs to postpone summit.  
  BY SALAH NASRAWI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Hopes for holding an Arab summit on the
stalled Middle East peace talks faded Thursday after Egypt and
Syria expressed doubts about its outcome.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been pushing for the
conference to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to accept a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from
parts of the West Bank.
	   ``There is no urgency to hold a summit. It will be held if the
peace process is frozen,'' said Osama el-Baz, the chief political
adviser of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
	   ``The summit is not on the table... what is important is its
contents and its objectives,'' said el-Baz.
	   His statement came a day after Syria said such a meeting is
unnecessary since some Arab countries are unwilling to implement
resolutions of past summits urging cutting ties with Israel.
	   ``We are not in need of a new summit in as much as we are in
need of an explicit stance and policy which makes the wrong doers
go back to their blunder,'' said a commentary by the state-run
Syrian Arab News Agency.
	   A Jordanian government official said Wednesday that the United
States had asked Jordan and Saudi Arabia to postpone the convening
of an Arab summit by a week to give Washington more time to
persuade Israel to accept its compromise proposal.
	   The request was made by Thomas Pickering, an undersecretary of
state for political affairs, said the Jordanian official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   Pickering, speaking to reporters in Bahrain Thursday night, said
the peace process was at a crucial stage.
	   ``If there were going to be an Arab summit, it needed to be very
carefully prepared,'' Pickering said. ``But it's up to Arab leaders
when they will have a summit.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A dam lock at a lake that supplies
most of San Juan's drinking water smashed open Thursday, sending
powerful torrents of water downstream and forcing hundreds of
people to abandon their homes.
	   A steel gate at the 35-year-old Lake Carraizo reservoir broke
shortly after noon (16:00 GMT), pouring water into a tributary of
the Loiza River. There were no immediate reports of injuries at the
dam, in suburban Trujillo Alto. By late Thursday, officials said
the danger had passed.
	   More than 2 million gallons (7.5 million liters) of water poured
from the break in 3 1/2 hours, Puerto Rico's water authority said.
	   Police and civil defense workers checked homes in low-lying
areas of the river basin to urge residents to move to higher
ground, said authority spokeswoman Zaima Negron.
	   Shelters were opened at schools in suburban Carolina and the
nearby towns of Canovanas and Loiza, while police closed roads and
bridges near the dam, causing large traffic jams.
	   What caused the failure was not immediately known, and engineers
were inspecting the damage. But water service in San Juan won't be
affected, Secretary of State Norma Burgos told reporters.
	   Carraizo supplies water to about 60 percent of 1.5 million
residents in the capital area. The remaining 40 percent get their
water from La Plata reservoir.
	   A dam operator, Maximo Ortiz Adorno, said he had complained to
water authority officials last year that maintenance work was
needed on the steel doors that open and seal the reservoir. He said
no action had been taken.
	   Burgos said the lock that busted Thursday had been repaired only
two weeks ago.
	   The break was the latest in a string of misfortunes to plague
the water agency, which has been criticized for its handling of
water rationing during times of drought.
	   Through years of neglect, silt had filled more than half of
Carraizo, forcing the authority to impose unnecessary rationing,
critics said. Dredging of the reservoir only began last year.
	   A third of authority water is lost to pipeline leaks, officials
say.
	   The government is building a dlrs 305 million pipeline that it
says will alleviate San Juan's water shortage by tapping into a
river and lake in north-central Puerto Rico. The project is to be
completed later this year.

Student activists arrested in Nigeria protest clampdown

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Security forces stormed the campus of one
of Nigeria's top universities to arrest student activists and
suppress planned pro-democracy protests, a student leader said
Thursday.
	   Seven students, including the vice president of the National
Association of Nigerian Students, were arrested Wednesday during
the day-long operation at the University of Ibadan.
	   The detention came a day before students and some faculty
members planned a demonstration to mark the June 4, 1996, killing
of Kudirat Abiola, the wife of jailed opposition leader Moshood
Abiola.
	   It was unclear whether the crackdown had prevented the planned
demonstrations, which did not materialize. Several other related
pro-democracy protests in other Nigerian cities went ahead.
	   ``We want to assert that no amount of brutality, arrest,
intimidation of whatever form can change the minds of Nigerian
students from waging war against the military dictatorship,'' said
Ogunlana Oludare, chairman of the West Africa Students Union.
	   Oludare denounced Gen. Sani Abacha's ruling military junta and
said the University of Ibadan students were arrested without just
cause.
	   Ibadan, a growing hotbed of anti-government activities, was
shaken by rioting on May 1, when thousands of protesters took to
the streets. Police shot and killed seven activists and arrested at
least 30 others.
	   Police and military reinforcements were deployed throughout
Ibadan and Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos in anticipation of
more protests against the junta over the next few weeks.
	   About 700 protesters who gathered Thursday around a mock coffin
were dispersed by police who fired live ammunition and teargas,
smashing the coffin. No injuries were reported.
	   In the town of Oshogbo, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) north
of Lagos, police broke up an hour-long protest by about 200
university students who marched through the streets singing
anti-military songs.
	   In addition to Thursday's anniversary to mark the death of
Kudirat Abiola, June 12 is remembered as the day when Abacha
canceled presidential elections in 1993 and began his rise to power
through a bloodless coup.
	   Fueling the anger are charges that Abacha's junta may be linked
to the Abiola's death.
	   Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 elections, was
jailed for treason when he defied Abacha's junta and declared
himself president. His wife, a vocal campaigner for her husband's
release, was shot dead by unknown gunmen.
	   For the past five years, Abacha has pledged to return power to
and elected civilian government, but has repeatedly reneged on the
promise.
	   In April he triggered a storm of protests by becoming the only
legal candidate to run for president in elections this August.

Britain says India could be helped to improve nuclear reactors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook dangled a
carrot in front of India Thursday to try to prevent an escalation
of its nuclear arms race with Pakistan.
	   Speaking after an emergency meeting of the five official nuclear
powers to discuss a response to the crisis, Cook said India could
be offered help to improve the ``deteriorating'' nuclear reactors
used to supply the country's tottering electricity supply system.
	   But it would have to give assurances that the help wouldn't be
diverted to boost India's nuclear weapons program, Cook said.
	   He stressed there was ``no question of rewarding those countries
for carrying out nuclear tests.''
	   The poor state of India's electricity system has caused riots in
recent weeks. Citizens in the capital New Delhi, frustrated over
frequent power outages, have taken to the streets and attacked
offices of government-run electricity offices.
	   In response to questions from reporters about the lack of
reference in a joint statement agreed at the meeting to sanctions
or other measures encouraging India and Pakistan to refrain from
nuclear proliferation, Cook said he raised the issue of help for
the country's electricity system.
	   ``There is a very real problem there for India, and it is a
problem we could be willing to assist,'' said Cook.
	   ``But we do need to be confident there are safeguards on those
civil nuclear reactors which could make sure that in helping those
(reactors), we were not unintentionally helping the nuclear weapons
program.''
	   Cook told a news conference after the meeting of the U.N.
Security Council's five permanent members that ministers approved
``without change or controversy'' a text in which they agreed to
seek assurances from India and Pakistan that they wouldn't carry
out further tests.
	   Cook said sanctions weren't addressed by the meeting, which he
called ``very successful.''

Mexico says U.S. advised on sting, but consent never given
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Ffrench is correct in 13th graf  
  By KEN GUGGENHEIM  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican officials say they had some advance
knowledge of a major U.S. money laundering investigation that has
inflamed relations between the two countries, but they never
approved it.
	   The acknowledgment late Wednesday that U.S. Customs Service
officials had discussed the investigation with a Mexican deputy
attorney general two years ago did little to ease Mexican criticism
over U.S. handling of the case.
	   For two weeks, Mexicans officials have accused the United States
of violating its sovereignty in the ``Operation Casablanca'' money
laundering investigation, which last month led to the arrests of
160 people _ including about two dozen Mexican bankers.
	   They said the United States failed to inform it about the
investigation, even though undercover operations were apparently
carried out in Mexico. The Mexican government has filed a protest
and officials say they will seek the extradition of U.S. agents who
broke their laws.
	   In a statement, the Mexican attorney general's office
acknowledged that U.S. Customs officials met with then-Deputy
Attorney General Rafael Estrada Samano in January 1996 and provided
some details of the investigation.
	   They said Estrada told them the Americans did not request
Mexican help in the investigation and did not reveal that it
involved a sting operation _ illegal under Mexican laws.
	   The meeting ``in no way can be considered an authorization or a
validation for undercover informants or witnesses in the service of
the U.S. government ... to carry out actions on national
territory,'' it said.
	   Estrada said he told then-Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia
about the discussion.
	   In a radio interview, Lozano said Customs officials did not
reveal the magnitude of the investigation or provide details.
``It's evident that an operation of this type ... requires a
follow-up which effectively was never given,'' he said.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees
the Customs Service, confirmed that officials had met with Estrada,
but had no further information.
	   Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said Tuesday that Mexico
would seek the indictment of any U.S. agents who violated Mexican
law and that extradition agreements require the United States to
comply with the request.
	   Green said U.S. agents are suspected of inciting the commission
of a crime, facilitating money-laundering operations and usurping
Mexican powers.
	   On Thursday, her spokesman, Leonardo Ffrench, repeated that
Mexico expects the agents will be brought to justice.
	   ``Every country has its legal framework that has to be respected
by every resident, whether citizens or foreigners,'' he said.
	   In Washington on Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said that
talk of extraditing U.S. agents to Mexico is premature. ``I'm sure
that the Mexican government does not assume guilt until it has
thoroughly investigated a matter,'' Reno said.

Primakov: halt South Asian arms race without sanctions
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan, India-Nuclear  
  By ERICA BULMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Russia will do anything necessary to reduce the
potential arms race between India and Pakistan, but will never
impose economic sanctions, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Thursday.
	   ``We believe that economic sanctions are counter-productive,''
said Primakov. ``They have the biggest impact on the common people
and neighboring countries.''
	   At the same time, sanctions ``have little effect on leaders who
often act in isolation and sometimes unpredictably,'' Primakov told
reporters after a meeting with foreign ministers of the four other
original nuclear weapons powers.
	   ``We don't want them to be unpredictable,'' he said.
	   Primakov said the leaders would work not only against
development nuclear arsenals, but also to discourage tests of
missiles.
	   Nations that develop missiles ``usually come closer to
possessing nuclear weapons,'' he added.
	   Primakov said the five ministers offered to help ease tensions
between the two countries over the disputed territory of Kashmir
even though India maintains it should be handled between New Delhi
and Islamabad.
	   ``We believe it should be possible to combine the points of view
of India and Pakistan without intervention into domestic affairs,
without attempts to bring this problem to an international level,
and just help them to find a solution,'' said Primakov.
	   Primakov said major nonnuclear countries, such as Japan, South
Africa, Canada, Brazil and Italy, could also play a role in getting
India and Pakistan to join in the global move away from nuclear
weapons.
	   ``It is exactly due to the fact they are non-nuclear states that
they can be of real importance,'' said Primakov. ``During our
discussion we thought that many states which volunteered to
renounce nuclear weapons could help, taking into account their
experience and how much they have gained economically and
politically.''
	   Third World countries, closely linked to India and Pakistan,
could also play a restraining role, he said.
	   ``I would like to stress the total unanimity to take necessary
measures to reduce the danger of this challenge,'' Primakov said.
	   The ministers said it was essential to prevent the undermining
of of ``the nonproliferation treaty which was signed with such
difficulty.''

BBC reporters charged, to stand trial Saturday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists were charged Thursday for filming without permission in
a remote area, government officials said.
	   The three men are to stand trial Saturday, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The men, BBC producer Robin Barnwell, reporter Ragi Ommar and
cameraman Frank Smith, were charged with breaking Yemen's press
law. They were accused of failing to obtain permission from
authorities to travel to areas in Western Yemen where kidnappings
usually take place.
	   But the law requires only that resident journalists inform
authorities on their movements.
	   The three men were arrested May 26 after they spent a week with
the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles)
northeast of the capital, San`a, doing a story on kidnappings.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure of a British teacher, David Mitchell, his
wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben.
	   Armed tribesmen who rule over large parts of Yemen kidnap
foreigners for ransom to wrest concessions from the government.

Singapore tops global competitiveness rankings
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0500 GMT Friday, June 5, 1998  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For the second year in a row, Singapore remains
the world's most competitive economy, ahead of Hong Kong and the
United States, according to the World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Report 1998 released Friday.
	   The competitiveness rankings define which countries have a range
of market and factors of production which give them the capacity to
achieve sustained economic growth, explained the World Economic
Forum report.
	   Countries are ranked according to their openness, government,
finance, infrastructure, technology, management, labor and
institutions. Nations are given scores in each category, then an
average of these factors is taken to evaluate the overall
competitiveness.
	   Singapore and Hong Kong owe their high rankings to the fact they
scored well on all factors, while the United States received top
marks for finance, infrastructure, technology and management, said
the report.
	   ``After the return of Hong Kong to China business, responses
remain generally positive about Hong Kong,'' said Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and
co-chairman of the Advisory Board of the Global Competitiveness
Report.
	   ``Hong Kong is caught up in the external crisis in the region
and is a service provider like Singapore. Both are well-run
countries.''
	   The United States is by far and away the most competitive large
country. Considering other countries with populations greater than
50 million, Britain ranked fourth overall followed by Japan in
12th.
	   Britain, Canada, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway
and Luxembourg complete the top-ten list, followed by Ireland,
Japan, New Zealand and Finland, according to the report.
	   The three largest European Union countries France (22nd),
Germany (24th) and Italy (41st) rank about the same as last year.
European countries tend to have high scores on infrastructure,
technology and management but these are offset by low scores on
government and labor markets.
	   The survey is one of two produced by competitive organizations
in Switzerland at this time of year, the other consisting of a
survey of world business leaders and institutes by the
International Institute for Management Development.
	   The Executive Opinion Survey conducted each year by the World
Economic Forum combines quantitative data and survey data from the
Executive Opinion Survey. Over 3,000 leading business executives in
53 countries responded, the report said. _______

Amnesty: Equatorial Guinea convicts face ethnic hatred, death

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Amnesty International pressured
Equatorial Guinea's president Friday to grant clemency to 15 death
row inmates, whom it says were tortured and persecuted on ethnic
grounds.
	   Amnesty's Secretary General Pierre Sane said the convicts _
members of Equatorial Guinea's minority Bubi tribe _ were unfairly
condemned to death for treason this week after they confessed while
being tortured by the military.
	   Many others were victims of cruel torture and sexual abuse, Sane
said.
	   Equatorial Guinea denied the charges.
	   The 15 were among more than 100 defendants _ including four
Spaniards of Equatorial Guinean origin _ tried for sedition during
a five-day summary military tribunal.
	   Another 40 received jail terms ranging from six to 26 years,
while at least six died in detention as a result of torture, Sane
said in a report faxed to the Ivory Coast in West Africa.
	   The fate of the remaining 39 defendants was unclear.
	   Torture was meted out to all, Amnesty said. Detained women were
forced to swim naked in the mud in front of other detainees and
some were sexually abused. Other women were held hostage, without
being charged, in order to lure their husbands or relatives to turn
themselves in.
	   ``Empty tombs are waiting for living people. I urge the
president of Equatorial Guinea to leave these sepulchers empty and
spare the lives of these people,'' Sane said.
	   The defendants were accused of involvement in a Jan. 21 attack
on a military barracks on Equatorial Guinea's Bioko Island, home of
the minority Bubi tribe.
	   The attack left four soldiers and one civilian dead and resulted
in the arrests of some 500 people, mostly Bubi. The island is the
stronghold of an outlawed Bubi-based opposition political group,
the Bioko Autonomy Movement.
	   Some defendants showed visible scars from their ordeal, and at
least 10 had parts of their ears severed off with razor blades, the
Amnesty report said.
	   Most had been detained solely on account of their ethnic origin,
Sane said in the report.
	   A diplomat from Equatorial Guinea, however, said the trials were
fair.
	   ``There is no basis to any claims of this trial being held on
ethnic issues,'' said Maria Ebuna, a diplomat at Equatorial
Guinea's embassy in Washington. ``Illegal, violent terrorist acts
were committed and those put to trial just happened to be from the
same ethnic group. It was a pretty fair trial.''
	   She said the government had not been involved in the case.
	   Although President Teodoro Obiang suspended the 15 executions at
the last moment, the sentences remain in place and it was unclear
how long the suspension would last.
	   Amnesty said the trial broke most international standards of a
fair hearing. Many of the detainees were not allowed to testify and
military prosecutors offered little evidence against them.

	   They said Estrada told them the Americans did not request
Mexican help in the investigation and did not reveal that it
involved a sting operation _ illegal under Mexican laws.
	   The meeting ``in no way can be considered an authorization or a
validation for undercover informants or witnesses in the service of
the U.S. government ... to carry out actions on national
territory,'' it said.
	   Estrada said he told then-Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia
about the discussion.
	   In a radio interview, Lozano said Customs officials did not
reveal the magnitude of the investigation or provide details.
``It's evident that an operation of this type ... requires a
follow-up which effectively was never given,'' he said.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees
the Customs Service, confirmed that officials had met with Estrada,
but had no further information.
	   Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said Tuesday that Mexico
would seek the indictment of any U.S. agents who violated Mexican
law and that extradition agreements require the United States to
comply with the request.
	   Green said U.S. agents are suspected of inciting the commission
of a crime, facilitating money-laundering operations and usurping
Mexican powers.
	   On Thursday, her spokesman, Leonardo Ffrench, repeated that
Mexico expects the agents will be brought to justice.
	   ``Every country has its legal framework that has to be respected
by every resident, whether citizens or foreigners,'' he said.
	   In Washington on Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said that
talk of extraditing U.S. agents to Mexico is premature. ``I'm sure
that the Mexican government does not assume guilt until it has
thoroughly investigated a matter,'' Reno said.
	   In a separate briefing, U.S. presidential spokesman Mike McCurry
declined to comment about the possibility of extraditing drug
agents. ``That's an entirely hypothetical question,'' he said.

Mandela pledges Table Mountain as part of new Cape park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela has
declared Table Mountain part of a new Cape Peninsula National Park.
	   The embargoed announcement, timed to recognize World Environment
Day on Friday, said that the World Wildlife Fund had helped set up
a Table Mountain trust fund to support long term conservation ``of
this globally important area.''
	   Mandela said the new national park was South Africa's ``Gift to
the Earth'' under WWF's living planet campaign.
	   Table Mountain was an important visual and spiritual focus for
prisoners on nearby Robben Island, where Mandela spent most of his
27 years imprisoned by the former apartheid regime.
	   ``To us on Robben Island, Table Mountain was a beacon of hope,''
Mandela said. ``It represented the mainland to which we knew we
would one day return.''
	   He said the mountain was of immense ecological, cultural,
religious and economic significance to the whole country, recalling
the struggle of indigenous Khoikhoi tribes against Dutch settlers;
and of Indonesian and Malayan slaves brought there by white men.
	   The new park stretches from Table Mountain in Cape Town to Cape
Point and the Cape of Good Hope. It is home to some 2,285 plant
species, the WWF said.

World Cup: Maradona yet to decide whether to go to France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ For 12 years he was the star
attraction of the World Cup. Now retired and facing a serious of
legal setbacks, Diego Maradona has yet to decide if he will travel
to France or in what capacity.
	   ``This is not the best time for Diego,'' his manager Guillermo
Coppola said Wednesday. ``It's the first World Cup in a long time
that he won't be playing and he is sad.''
	   Coppola said the former captain of the Argentine national team
was working through a ``deep depression'' and had not decided if he
would travel to France.
	   Maradona has reportedly been offered jobs by television networks
in Argentina, Italy, and Mexico to serve as a commentator during
the month-long competition.
	   Coppola acknowledged that Maradona has since lost a few of the
offers, but he insists there are ``many, many opportunities.''
	   Maradona's indecision might be linked to his continuing legal
troubles.
	   An Argentine court earlier this week rejected an appeal by
Maradona's lawyers to move his pending legal case involving four
reporters to a federal court.
	   The case involves the soccer star's actions during a February
1994 incident when he fired an air rifle at photographers and
journalists outside his country home.
	   Seeking a four-year sentence, prosecutors have rejected
Maradona's offer to do community service.
	   Asked whether the case prevented the star from leaving the
country, Coppola said no.
	   The 1994 World Cup in the United States was the fourth and final
one for Maradona after testing revealed the drug ephedrine in his
system.

White Sox, Athletics Blue Jays post wins
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: NEW with Thursday's early games; will be updated  

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ Jamie Navarro pitched a complete
game eight-hitter and Jeff Abbott hit a three-run home run to lead
the Chicago White Sox past Kansas City 7-1 Thursday for their 11th
straight victory in Kauffman Stadium.
	   Navarro (5-6) snapped a personal three-game losing streak,
walking two and striking out one. He benefited from inning ending
double plays in the first, second, sixth and seventh.
	   The White Sox have beaten the Royals 12 of their last 13
meetings and have won four straight series from their AL Central
rivals.
	   Chad Kreuter and Magglio Ordonez, who had a career-high four
RBIs in Chicago's 10-5 victory the night before, had RBI singles in
the second for the White Sox.
  Athletics 6, Rangers 1
	   In Oakland, California, Rickey Henderson homered for the third
time in as many games and Jimmy Haynes and Bill Taylor combined on
a five-hitter, leading the Athletics past the Texas Rangers.
	   Haynes (4-2) struck out seven and walked five and with Taylor
shut down a Texas offense that is leading the majors in runs and
hits and produced a 16-10 victory over the A's on Wednesday night.
This time the teams finished in 2 hours and 24 minutes, Oakland's
quickest game this year.
	   Haynes allowed one run on five hits in 7 1-3 innings and Taylor
got five outs for his 10th save.
	   Rick Helling (7-3) failed in his third try for his eighth
victory. He allowed four runs on eight hits in seven innings while
striking out five and walking two.
  Blue Jays 9, Tigers 6
	   In Toronto, Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado each hit two-run
homers and Ed Sprague had a three-run double as the Blue Jays beat
the Detroit Tigers, Detroit's fifth straight losses.
	   Sprague's bases-clearing hit in the fifth gave Toronto a 7-2
lead, then they had to hold off a comeback sparked by Tony Clark's
two-run homer and Joe Randa's two-run double that cut it to 7-6 in
the seventh.
	   Woody Williams (7-2) won his fourth straight decision despite
giving up six runs, five earned, on seven hits in six innings. He
was relieved by Dan Plesac, Paul Quantrill and Randy Myers, who
pitched the ninth for his 14th save.
	   Alex Gonzalez had an RBI single and Jose Cruz Jr. had a
sacrifice fly in the eighth to allow the Blue Jays to pull away
again.

Euro nations launch economic policy council
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with meeting over, comments from Austrian minister;
EDITS to conform  
  By PAUL AMES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union took another step toward
making its single currency a reality Thursday when finance
ministers from 11 nations launched a new body to coordinate
economic policy in the euro era.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said those 11
nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1
should cut budget deficits more than planned, to take account of
Europe's quickening economic recovery.
	   ``Reductions in public deficits should reflect that favorable
development,'' de Silguy told reporters on the margin of the
meeting in a chateau outside Luxembourg.
	   He said the 11 euro nations should aim for an average deficit of
2 percent of gross domestic product this year and 1.5 percent of
GDP in 1999. That compares to current forecasts of 2.4 percent in
1998 and 2 percent for next year.
	   De Silguy's aides said the deficit cuts could be made without
further budgetary belt-tightening since increased growth would
bring in higher-than-expected revenues.
	   Ministers broadly welcomed the call for smaller deficits, but
said they wanted more time to discuss details and would return to
the issue when they next meet a month from now.
	   ``The positive economic situation means the budget situation can
be improved,'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who
chaired the meeting. ``We need to pursue sustainable budget
consolidation.''
	   The evening meeting was the first for the so-called ``euro-11
group'' which was set up to tighten consultations between nations
in the first group to switch to the euro.
	   In December, EU leaders agreed to create such a body after
months of wrangling. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece _ which
are staying out of the
	   single currency for now _ tried to block the setting up of the
council, fearing it would exclude them from key economic decisions.
	   Germany was concerned the council _ first suggested by France _
could be used to undermine the independence of the European Central
Bank which is to run monetary policy after the switch to the euro.
	   Edlinger insisted that would not be the case. ``Nobody has the
remotest intention of limiting the independence of the European
Central Bank,'' he told a news conference after the meeting.
	   He said the euro-11 group would invite ECB chairman Wim
Duisenberg to its meeting next month.
	   Although left out of the main workings of the euro-11, ministers
from the
	   other EU nations will be invited to attend some sessions.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown briefly
addressed the opening meeting, since his country currently holds
the EU's rotating presidency.
	   But he left after about 90 minutes, handing the chair to
Edlinger, whose country takes over the presidency from Britain on
July 1.
	   Brown's forced early departure drew criticism from opposition
lawmakers in Britain.
	   ``This is a humiliating position,'' said Graham Mather,
Conservative spokesman on European economics. ``The Labor
government (has) proved incapable of negotiating effectively in the
EU arena.''

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A weak upper level trough extending from the northeast Caribbean
northeastward across the Atlantic influenced our area once again
Thursday to produce active weather.
	   This feature will move east during the next few days, ending its
unstable influence over our islands. A gradual decrease in the
amount and intensity of showers and thunderstorms will occur during
the next two to three days.
	   Residents of the San Juan metropolitan area around the Loiza
River basin and adjacent areas are urged to stay tuned to the
ongoing situation with the Lake Carraizo Dam.
	   The Loiza River will remain well above normal this evening and
tonight, and will not begin to recede until the flow of water from
the reservoir is halted.
	   A flash flood warning was in effect late this afternoon because
of the rushing water from the dam.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a revolutionary finding that may play a crucial
role in understanding how stars formed and the universe will
evolve, physicists announced Friday they have evidence that the
neutrino _ an elusive, subatomic particle _ has mass, or weight.
	   If substantiated, the discovery by an international team of
scientists at an underground lab in Japan could force rethinking of
a central theory of modern science: That the universe began
expanding at the Big Bang and will keep expanding forever.
	   It also may help solve the mystery of why the universe isn't as
heavy as science says it should be.
	   Neutrinos are one of the basic building blocks of atoms and, in
turn, everything else. They are also particularly elusive.
Neutrinos have no charge and are so small that they pass right
through matter, making them very tricky to track.
	   Physics' ``standard model'' theory of how fundamental particles
work decrees that neutrinos should weigh nothing at all.
	   A team of 120 scientists working on a project known as the
Super-Kamiokande Experiment, believe they have found evidence that
proves that part of the theory needs to be reconsidered. They can't
measure a neutrino's mass, but have evidence that strongly suggests
it has some.
	   ``This is something that physicists have hoped for and eagerly
sought for decades,'' said John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the
Institute for Advanced Study and a visiting professor at Princeton
University.
	   ``These new results could prove to be the key to finding the
holy grail of physics, the unified theory,'' University of Hawaii
physicist John Learned, a leader in the research effort, said in
Thursday's Honolulu Star-Bulletin.
	   The unified theory is an effort to combine in one set of
mathematical equations all of the fundamental forces in nature:
gravity; electromagnetic energy, such as light; and the
interactions between subatomic particles. The concept was first
proposed by Albert Einstein, but, so far, the search for a unified
theory has failed because of uncertainties _ such as the mass of
neutrinos.
	   Neutrinos come in three types _ physicists call them flavors _
named according to what other subatomic particles they hang around
with. There are electron-neutrinos, muon-neutrinos, and
tau-neutrinos.
	   The scientists in Japan say they have detected that some
neutrinos oscillate, or change type, as they pass through space or
matter. And another widely accepted theory of physics says anything
that oscillates must have mass.
	   ``We are very confident that this proves it,'' said Chang Kee
Jung, member of the project team and a professor of Physics and
Astronomy from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
	   Neutrino mass could help explain a thorny problem: why the
weight of the planets, stars and all other known stuff in the
cosmos, when added together, is so much less than the model of the
universe predicts.
	   The visible universe makes up barely 10 percent of that
theoretical matter, leading astronomers to conclude that much more
of it is hidden in mysterious dark spots or that the theory is
seriously flawed.
	   The mass of an individual neutrino is likely infinitesimally
small _ perhaps billions of times less than an electron, the
particle with the smallest known mass. But there are so many
neutrinos that, together, they could account for a lot of the
universe's mysteriously missing mass.
	   A neutrino with mass also could have played a crucial role in
the formation of celestial objects, in their movement during the
billions of years since the universe was born and in how the
universe will evolve.
	   In calculating the expansion believed under way since the Big
Bang, scientists now will have to factor in a neutrino with mass _
and decide whether that changes their understanding of the fate of
the universe.
	   The group in Japan, which includes researchers from Japan, the
United States, Germany and Poland, detected neutrinos using a
50,000-ton tank filled with highly purified water down a
half-mile-deep mine shaft in the central Japan city of Takayama.
	   Surrounding the tank are 13,000 photomultiplier tubes that
detect the faintest flash of light. The apparatus was buried in the
mine to block cosmic rays and radiation.
	   Nuclear fusion at the sun's core produces neutrinos which are
then hurled this way at the speed of light. The scientists hoped
that at least a few of the trillions of particles that hit earth
every second would pass through their tank, collide with an atom
there and set off a little flash of light they could detect and
measure.
	   Their conclusion that neutrinos have mass came after a year of
data collection. Statistical analysis of the data, Jung said,
strongly suggested that some of the neutrinos had changed type.
	   The researchers likely will have to wait for another laboratory
to repeat their experiment and findings before it is accepted as
scientific fact. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, 200 miles (320
kilometers) north of Toronto, is conducting similar experiments;
only a handful of such facilities exist.

Akinwande hopes to put Lewis fight behind him against Holyfield
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with weigh-in  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The last time Henry Akinwande fought for the
heavyweight title, he had his arms locked around Lennox Lewis so
often that he was finally disqualified in the fifth round for doing
more holding than fighting.
	   The referee went so far as to suggest Akinwande was scared
stiff.
	   So why, less than a year later, is the former British Olympian
getting another chance at a title Saturday night against Evander
Holyfield?
	   ``It's real simple,'' Holyfield said. ``He's with Don King.''
	   Promotional ties sometimes count more than ability in boxing, a
big reason why Akinwande will enter the ring at Madison Square
Garden Saturday night to fight Holyfield for his WBA heavyweight
title.
	   It's a fight Holyfield doesn't much want, though he will pick up
a dlrs 10 million payday to add to the dlrs 175 million he has
already made in the ring. But talks with Lewis over a title
unification fight went nowhere, and Akinwande gets the shot by
virtue of his No. 1 ranking by the WBA.
	   ``There's no other reason for this fight other than he's ranked
No. 1,'' Holyfield said.
	   Holyfield is a 7-1 favorite to retain his title against
Akinwande, who followed his loss to Lewis last July with an
uninspiring 12-round decision over Orlin Norris, Jr., to get his
top ranking by the WBA.
	   That's not to say the 6-foot-7 (1.97-meter) Akinwande can't
fight. The Lewis fight was his only defeat as a pro and he has
shown some talent to go along with his size in winning 33 fights.
	   And you can never count out a fighter with a wingspan of more
than seven feet. Akinwande not only towers over Holyfield by at
least five inches (13 cms), but enjoys a 4-inch (10-cm) reach
advantage. He's also heavier, weighing in Thursday at 240.25 pounds
(108.11 kg) to 218.5 (98.33) for the champion.
	   ``I don't have anything to prove,'' Akinwande said. ``I just
have to prove something to myself. I've been doing this job for a
long time and just because I lost one fight doesn't make me a bad
fighter.''
	   Akinwande had held the fringe WBO heavyweight title before
giving it up to fight Lewis for the WBC crown. Before losing to
Lewis, only a draw against Axel Schulz in 1992 marred an otherwise
perfect record.
	   But Akinwande has always been defensive minded in the ring, and
hasn't responded well to fighters who pressure him, as Holyfield is
sure to do.
	   ``He's had a lack of confidence in the ring before,'' said
Emanuel Steward, who trains Lewis and was brought in to train
Akinwande for the fight. ``I have seen a drastic change in the
things he's done in the gym the last few weeks but we'll have to
see if he has it during the fight. He's going to have to prove it
to me.''
	   Akinwande bristles at the suggestion he was intimidated by Lewis
and refused this week to even discuss a performance made
particularly embarrassing because it came just a few weeks after
Mike Tyson bit Holyfield in their title fight.
	   ``I'm not embarrassed about nothing,'' Akinwande said.
``Sometimes you have a good night, sometimes you have a bad
night.''
	   If Akinwande comes to fight this time around, the bout figures
to be determined on how easily Holyfield is able to get inside
against Akinwande's long arms. If Akinwande chooses to hold, as he
did against Lewis, it could be a long and boring fight.
	   ``Eventually I'll get around his arms, but I don't know how,''
Holyfield said. ``I've been boxing for 27 years and my arms won't
get any longer before fight time. I'll just have to use my foot
speed against him.''
	   The fight tops a card at Madison Square Garden that features an
improbably title challenge by 46-year-old Roberto Duran against WBA
middleweight champion William Joppy and appearances by super
batamweight champion Johnny Tapia and popular female fighter
Christy Martin.

Singapore tops global competitiveness rankings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For the second year in a row, Singapore remains
the world's most competitive economy, ahead of Hong Kong and the
United States, according to the World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Report 1998 released Friday.
	   The competitiveness rankings define which countries have a range
of characteristics that give them the capacity to achieve sustained
economic growth, the report said.
	   Countries are ranked according to their openness, government,
finance, infrastructure, technology, management, labor and
institutions. Nations are given scores in each category, then an
average of these factors is taken to evaluate the overall
competitiveness.
	   Singapore and Hong Kong scored well on all factors, while the
United States received top marks for finance, infrastructure,
technology and management, said the report.
	   ``After the return of Hong Kong to China business, responses
remain generally positive about Hong Kong,'' said Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and
co-chairman of the Advisory Board of the Global Competitiveness
Report.
	   ``Hong Kong is caught up in the external crisis in the region
and is a service provider like Singapore. Both are well-run
countries.''
	   The United States is by far and away the most competitive large
country. Considering other countries with populations greater than
50 million, Britain ranked fourth overall followed by Japan in
12th.
	   Britain, Canada, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway
and Luxembourg complete the top-ten list, followed by Ireland,
Japan, New Zealand and Finland, according to the report.
	   The three largest European Union countries France (22nd),
Germany (24th) and Italy (41st) rank about the same as last year.
European countries tend to have high scores on infrastructure,
technology and management but have low scores on government and
labor markets.
	   The survey is one of two produced by competitive organizations
in Switzerland at this time of year, the other consisting of a
survey of world business leaders and institutes by the
International Institute for Management Development.
	   The Executive Opinion Survey conducted each year by the World
Economic Forum combines quantitative data and survey data from the
Executive Opinion Survey. More than 3,000 leading business
executives in 53 countries responded, the report said.

Ontario scrapping law that enabled union to form at Wal-Mart store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Ontario government moved Thursday to scrap a
law that caused a store in Windsor to become the first Wal-Mart
outlet in the world with a union even though most workers voted
against unionization.
	   A bill introduced in the provincial legislature would permit
union certification only when a majority of employees are in favor.
	   Under the current law, Ontario's labor relations board can order
an automatic union certification even when a majority of employees
vote against a union _ if it feels misconduct by the employer has
poisoned the atmosphere and scared many of the workers.
	   That's what happened at the Wal-Mart outlet in Windsor. The
board ruled the U.S. department store chain had interfered in the
union drive and ordered unionization even though less than half
cast ballots in favor.
	   Under the new bill, the labor board could order a new vote if
there is evidence of misconduct.
	   A Wal-Mart representative was among the first to praise the new
bill.
	   ``We believe it protects workplace democracy,'' said company
official Edward Gould.

Euro nations launch economic policy council
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with meeting over, comments from Austrian minister;
EDITS to conform  
  By PAUL AMES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union took another step toward
making its single currency a reality Thursday when finance
ministers from 11 nations launched a new body to coordinate
economic policy in the euro era.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yve-Thibault de Silguy said those 11
nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1
should cut budget deficits more than planned, to take account of
Europe's quickening economic recovery.
	   ``Reductions in public deficits should reflect that favorable
development,'' de Silguy told reporters on the margin of the
meeting in a chateau outside Luxembourg.
	   He said the 11 euro nations should aim for an average deficit of
2 percent of gross domestic product this year and 1.5 percent of
GDP in 1999. That compares to current forecasts of 2.4 percent in
1998 and 2 percent for next year.
	   De Silguy's aides said the deficit cuts could be made without
further budget cuts since increased growth would bring in
higher-than-expected revenues.
	   Ministers broadly welcomed the call for smaller deficits, but
said they wanted more time to discuss details and would return to
the issue when they next meet a month from now.
	   ``The positive economic situation means the budget situation can
be improved,'' said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who
chaired the meeting. ``We need to pursue sustainable budget
consolidation.''
	   The evening meeting was the first for the so-called ``euro-11
group,'' which was set up to tighten consultations between nations
in the first group to switch to the euro.
	   In December, EU leaders agreed to create such a body after
months of wrangling. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece _ which
are staying out of the single currency for now _ tried to block the
setting up of the council, fearing it would exclude them from key
economic decisions.
	   Germany was concerned the council _ first suggested by France _
could be used to undermine the independence of the European Central
Bank, which is to run monetary policy after the switch to the euro.
	   Edlinger insisted that would not be the case. ``Nobody has the
remotest intention of limiting the independence of the European
Central Bank,'' he told a news conference after the meeting.
	   He said the euro-11 group would invite ECB chairman Wim
Duisenberg to its meeting next month.
	   Although left out of the main workings of the euro-11, ministers
from the other EU nations will be invited to attend some sessions.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown briefly
addressed the opening meeting, since his country currently holds

Funk takes first-round lead at Kemper Open
</HEADLINE>
  By RON SIRAK  
  AP Golf Writer  

<TEXT>
	   POTOMAC, Maryland (AP) _ Fred Funk got up and down from every
bizarre corner of TPC at Avenel on Thursday and shot a 7-under-par
64 to take a one-stroke lead over Chris Perry after the first round
of the Kemper Open.
	   Playing just two days following eye surgery that corrected his
vision from 20-300 to 20-30, Funk chipped in once, holed out from a
bunker another time, had a 100-foot (30-meter) two-putt and another
two-putt from 72 feet (22 meters) in a scrambling round.
	   ``I really just got frustrated with the contacts I had all the
time,'' said Funk, who has worn glasses for 15 years. ``I wanted to
see if I could eliminate having contacts.''
	   Mike Weir, J.L. Lewis, Tommy Armour III and Craig Parry were
three strokes back at 67. Armour got into the tournament as an
alternate when Tiger Woods withdrew with a sore back.
	   Defending Kemper Open champion Justin Leonard and Masters winner
Mark O'Meara were among a group of players at 68.
	   Woody Austin also finished at 68, but he had one of the rarest
shots in golf _ a double-eagle 2 on the 520-yard (473-meter) par-5
sixth hole, sinking a 1-iron from 216 yards (197 meters). It was
the first double eagle on the PGA Tour this year.
	   Funk has missed the cut in five tournaments already this year
and played so poorly in the BellSouth last month that he
accidentally injured his caddie when he threw a club in anger.
	   ``I tossed a club and hit him in the wrong spot,'' Funk said.
``That woke me up to saying that this is ridiculous to get so
mad.''
	   Playing a competitive round for the first time since laser
surgery on Tuesday, Funk turned in a round that was not much to
look at _ except for the final score.
	   In a strange stretch of five holes beginning on No. 4, Funk made
four birdies _ only one of them in a routine manner.
	   He chipped in from 20 feet (6 meters) on No. 4, rolled in a
10-foot (3-meter) putt for birdie on the next hole, bounced his
second shot off a tree and onto the extreme edge of the green on
the par-5 sixth hole and two-putted from 100 feet (30 meters) for a
birdie, and then holed a 20-yard (18 meters) shot from a bunker so
deep on No. 8 that his head could not be seen above the lip.
	   ``You don't hole bunker shots like that one on eight,'' Funk
said, admitting that he amazed even himself. ``That was kind of a
magic hole for me. That was fun.''
	   It was especially fun since Funk was born in Maryland and from
1982-88 was the golf coach at the University of Maryland. He has
also never played well in the Kemper, missing the cut five of the
last eight years and never finishing above 27th place.
	   ``It's good to play well here at home,'' Funk said. ``It's been
a frustrating experience here at Avenel.''
	   After getting to 8-under when he hit a 5-iron to two feet on No.
15, Funk stumbled a bit down the stretch, making his only bogey on
No. 16 when he drove poorly and could only chip back to the
fairway, and then scrambling _ once again _ this time for a par on
the last hole, two-putting from 72 feet (21 meters).
	   Perry started on the back nine and made birdies on three of the
first five holes.
	   ``I feel like I know how to play the golf course,'' Perry said
after his bogey-free round. He attributed his fast start in part to
being in the first group of the day to play the back nine.
	   ``You've got nine perfect greens on your front nine,'' Perry
said. ``You don' have any spike marks to deal with or heel prints,
so you feel like you can make pretty good putts.''
	   Perry also started his second nine fast, making birdies on three
of the first five holes, then closed with four consecutive pars.

Singapore tops global competitiveness rankings
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CLARIFIES that Singapore is No. 1 for third year in a row;
ADDS lowest ranked countries; EMBARGOED by source until 0500 GMT
Friday.  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ For the third year in a row, Singapore remains the
world's most competitive economy, ahead of Hong Kong and the United
States, according to the World Economic Forum's Global
Competitiveness Report 1998 released Friday.
	   The competitiveness rankings define which countries have a range
of characteristics that give them the capacity to achieve sustained
economic growth, the report said.
	   Countries are ranked according to their openness, government,
finance, infrastructure, technology, management, labor and
institutions. Nations are given scores in each category, then an
average of these factors is taken to evaluate the overall
competitiveness.
	   Singapore and Hong Kong scored well on all factors, while the
United States received top marks for finance, infrastructure,
technology and management, said the report.
	   ``After the return of Hong Kong to China business, responses
remain generally positive about Hong Kong,'' said Jeffrey Sachs,
director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and
co-chairman of the Advisory Board of the Global Competitiveness
Report.
	   ``Hong Kong is caught up in the external crisis in the region
and is a service provider like Singapore. Both are well-run
countries.''
	   The United States is by far and away the most competitive large
country. Considering other countries with populations greater than
50 million, Britain ranked fourth overall followed by Japan in
12th.
	   Britain, Canada, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway
and Luxembourg complete the top-ten list, followed by Ireland,
Japan, New Zealand and Finland, according to the report.
	   The three largest European Union countries France (22nd),
Germany (24th) and Italy (41st) rank about the same as last year.
European countries tend to have high scores on infrastructure,
technology and management but have low scores on government and
labor markets.
	   For the second year in a row, Ukraine was ranked last on the
list, just ahead of Russia, Zimbabwe and India.
	   The survey is one of two produced by competitive organizations
in Switzerland at this time of year, the other consisting of a
survey of world business leaders and institutes by the
International Institute for Management Development.
	   The Executive Opinion Survey conducted each year by the World
Economic Forum combines quantitative data and survey data from the
Executive Opinion Survey. More than 3,000 leading business
executives in 53 countries responded, the report said.

Malone will keep shooting, Jordan eyes Hornacek matchup
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB BAUM  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ There's a lot more to the Utah Jazz than
Karl Malone.
	   If anyone hadn't figured that by now, Utah's 88-85 overtime
victory over Chicago in Game 1 of the National Basketball
Association Finals removed all doubt.
	   ``We can pick him up and carry him sometimes,'' Utah's Bryon
Russell said. ``He doesn't always have to carry all the load.
That's something you guys don't know about yet. You think it's all
about Karl Malone.''
	   On Wednesday night, it was all about John Stockton and a Utah
bench that has gained momentum through the playoffs. And it was all
about an obviously weary Chicago team falling apart at crunch time.
	   Even Michael Jordan made mistakes, most notably failing to
notice the 24-second shot clock was about to expire in the final
minute of overtime.
	   ``I thought we were very fatigued last night,'' Chicago coach
Phil Jackson said on Thursday. ``I actually tried to get Michael
out of the game in the third quarter and he bargained his way back
in. I watched in the video and our hands were on their knees in a
defensive posture.''
	   They have only two days off before Friday night's Game 2.
	   They will hope for a second consecutive off night for Malone,
who settled for, and almost always missed, jump shots against the
defense of the bigger Luc Longley in Game 1.
	   Malone hinted he might be taking it to the hoop more on Friday.
	   ``I had opportunities,'' he said. ``Let's just say that Luc was
a great defensive player and I didn't do the things I was capable
of maybe doing. I made a minor adjustment for tomorrow night's
game. I'm not going to tell you what it is. But I'm not going to
stop shooting, if that's what you're asking.''
	   Utah coach Jerry Sloan said Malone's misfiring was the least of
his concerns.
	   ``It's no big deal,'' Sloan said. ``I'm not going to lose any
sleep over it. He'll either make shots or miss them. That's not a
brilliant statement but that's all this game is. He's liable to
have those same shots and make them the next time. It wasn't like
he was having to take shots that were totally strange to him.
	   ``The positions he got the ball on the floor were almost
identical positions where he's had the ball the last four or five
years.''
	   Malone was bailed out by his old partner, John Stockton, who had
24 points and eight assists, including seven of Utah's nine points
in overtime.
	   The ever-mild-mannered Stockton shrugged off the performance.
About the only thing that gets him even slightly riled is the
suggestion that, at 36, he's getting too old to be expected to come
up with that kind of performance on a regular basis.
	   ``I think people want to remind you of your age all the time,''
Stockton said, ``and I just try to forget about that. I do the same
training regimen I did when I was 24. I try to get ready for the
game the same way I did when I was 24. I try to basically play the
same way.
	   ``I think as you continue playing, the thing you learn is when
to use your energy and when not to, and sometimes that's construed
as old age.''
	   Stockton's efficiency has been greatly enhanced by the presence
of Howard Eisley, the backup point guard who played 23 highly
effective minutes in Game 1. That made Stockton the freshest player
on the court in the overtime.

Osgood gets mad, vows to get even
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GOODMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ First get mad, then get even.
	   Detroit goalie Chris Osgood says that's his key to putting a bad
game behind him and getting ready for Game 6 of the National Hockey
League Western Conference playoffs.
	   After holding the Stars to one goal through most of three
periods in Game 5, Osgood allowed Guy Carbonneau's tying goal with
1:25 left in regulation.
	   Forty-six seconds into overtime, a 70-foot (21-meter) slap shot
by Jamie Langenbrunner eluded Osgood, giving Dallas a 3-2 home-ice
victory and sending the series back to Detroit on Friday.
	   The Red Wings lead 3-2.
	   ``I wasn't upset,'' Osgood said after practice Thursday. ``I
wasn't disappointed because I've been playing well lately.''
	   What Osgood felt, he said, was anger at seeing a good effort
erased in a 2:11 span and having a quirky bounce send the series
into a sixth game. And he felt determination to put that anger to
work.
	   ``I really want to play the next game. I thrive on situations
like this,'' he said.
	   The Red Wings presented a solid line Thursday in Osgood's
defense.
	   ``There's no player on our team that doesn't think he's going to
play a top-notch game,'' coach Scotty Bowman said.
	   ``We're all behind him,'' Martin Lapointe said. ``We know he's a
good goaltender. He's carried us this season.''
	   Wednesday's loss, like the club's many playoff wins, was a team
effort, Sergei Fedorov said.
	   ``It's not about Chris. Chris is just at the end of the
process,'' Fedorov said, citing a lack of offense by the Red Wings.
	   Captain Steve Yzerman said his goalie is a strong, resilient
player who will be hard to beat Friday.
	   ``He's a tough guy. He's going to rebound,'' Yzerman said.
	   Wednesday's quick reversal of fortune is typical of postseason
play, Darren McCarty said. ``It's the way hockey goes. It's the way
playoffs are.''
	   Carbonneau said his game-tying goal capped a strong team effort,
in which Dallas outshot Detroit 36-20.
	   ``Nobody wanted this series to end,'' Carbonneau said. ``Nobody
wanted our season to be over.''
	   ``It was a big-time load off my shoulders when Carbonneau's goal
went in,'' Stars goalie Ed Belfour said. ``It was a great shot. Our
guys had been working so hard down at that end, it was nice to
finally see them rewarded.''
	   Belfour said it helped relieve his own disappointment at
allowing Igor Larionov's go-ahead goal at 16:20 of the second
period.
	   ``It's a goal that I'm not happy about at all,'' Belfour said.
``I would definitely like to have it back. It was just a slap shot
that seemed to take a dip at the last moment.''
	   As for his game-winning shot, Langenbrunner said he was as
surprised as anyone to see it bounce off Osgood's stick and into
the goal.
	   ``Luckily, it just sort of skipped in,'' he said. ``When it went
in, I was kind of shocked. But I'm happy.''

World Cup: U.S. soccer team heads to France
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSH DUBOW  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Optimism was evident Wednesday as the U.S.
soccer team, facing a tougher draw, departed for France on
Thursday.
	   ``Four years ago,we hoped we'd do well. This time we expect
it,'' said Tab Ramos, who is playing in his third World Cup. ``But
we have two of the best teams in the world in our group. For us to
advance to the second round, we will have to upset a very good
team.''
	   Those two teams are European champion Germany, which has won the
World Cup three times, and the dangerous Yugoslavia.
	   To beat those teams, the United States will have to improve on
its scoring. The team has scored 14 goals in 12 games this year,
posting a 6-3-3 record primarily on the strength of its defense and
goalkeeping from Kasey Keller, who has four consecutive shutouts.
	   ``I'd be much more concerned if we weren't creating
opportunities,'' coach Steve Sampson said. ``I think the goals will
come.''
	   Injuries to key personnel have affected the team's transition to
a new offense that features six midfielders and only one forward.
But Sampson said Thursday that midfielders Claudio Reyna, Frankie
Hejduk and Brian Maisonneuve have all healed after missing last
weekend's warmup match against Scotland with injuries.
	   The only remaining injury question for Sampson is forward Eric
Wynalda, the leading career goal scorer for the U.S. team, who is
battling back from knee surgery but should be healthy for the
opener against Germany.
	   There is a concern that the 11 players who will likely start on
June 15 will be playing together for the first time.
	   ``It certainly doesn't help when your starting team has not
played together before the World Cup,'' Ramos said. ``But this team
knows each other very well which should be an advantage for us.''
	   The most important player for the United States is Reyna, who
quarterbacks the team's attack. When Reyna sat out exhibition games
against Macedonia and Scotland with an injured right groin, the
U.S. team finished with scoreless ties.
	   When he played against Kuwait, the Unites States won 2-0. And in
April, Reyna had a goal and two assists in a 3-0 victory at
Austria.
	   ``We have the next 10 days to work on our killer instinct in
front of the box so we can put away our chances,'' said Reyna, who
missed the entire 1994 World Cup with a pulled right hamstring.
``Against a team like Germany, we will not get as many chances as
we did against Kuwait and Macedonia, so we will need to take
advantage of the ones we get.''
	   The team is looking forward to arriving in France, where World
Cup fever will be in full force.
	   ``Most of us have seen how huge the World Cup is, but to have it
in a soccer-mad country like France is new for many of us,'' Reyna
said. ``It will hit us hard once we land.''
	   The U.S. team's travels will not be affected by the striking Air
France pilots, who have agreed to fly the Americans on a charter to
Lyon, where they will train for their opening match against Germany
in Paris.
	   They will then take on Iran on June 21 in Lyon and close out the
opening round against Yugoslavia on June 25 in Nantes.

Mexican state police suspect 20 agents collaborated with kidnapper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors in a state bordering Mexico City
say they suspect more than 20 of their policemen may have
collaborated with a fugitive kidnapper, the newspaper Reforma
reported Thursday.
	   Police throughout Mexico state have been hunting for Daniel
Arizmendi since he escaped a May 21 raid on his safehouses in the
state of Morelos that led to the arrest of his wife, son and
daughter.
	   Prosecutors say they suspect Arizmendi, notorious for slicing
off the ears of victims to prompt relatives to pay ransom, in
dozens _ perhaps hundreds _ of kidnappings.
	   And they have said that police in several states apparently
helped protect him or even participated in his gang.
	   More than 20 state policeman collaborated with Arizmendi, said
state's deputy attorney general, Arturo Baca, was quoted as saying
in the Reforma newspaper.
	   ``There are some who could have participated directly in the
kidnappings, be it with information about the victim or even with
the capture, but there are others who could have participated only
in collecting the ransom or simply watching the house where they
kept the victims,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Mexico state borders Mexico City to the west, north and east.
Arizmendi was born and raised in the state, in the city of
Nezahualcoyotl.
	   The state's attorney general, Jorge Reyes Santana, confirmed
that his department is investigating to find policemen who might
have helped Arizmendi, Reforma reported.
	   Under suspicion are policemen friendly with Jose Angel Vivanco,
a 10-year veteran of the Mexico state Judicial Police, who left the
force in February 1994.
	   Newspapers this week published a photograph showing Vivanco
posing with Arizmendi, both of them holding guns.

Motorola cutting 15,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Also moving on financial wires.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO, Ill. (AP) _ Motorola Inc. is laying off 15,000
employees over the coming 12 months, the electronics giant
announced Thursday.
	   The 10 percent reduction in its worldwide work force is part of
a series of steps the company is taking to improve its slumping
financial performance.
	   ``The goal is to generate annualized savings, once all actions
have been implemented, of more than $750 million,'' said Robert L.
Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer.
	   In addition to the layoffs, Motorola said it will consolidate
manufacturing operations throughout the company, with emphasis on
semiconductors, messaging, information and media segments.
	   The company also will dump poorly performing businesses.
	   Special charges of $1.95 billion will be taken in the second
quarter.
	   Even excluding the special charges, second-quarter earnings are
expected to be well below expectations, the company said.
	   Motorola blamed the cuts on ``deteriorating demand and global
pricing pressure,'' particularly in semiconductors because of the
Asian economic crisis.
	   The company plans to close its pager factory in Vega Baja,
Puerto Rico this month. Most of the plant's 1,500 employees have
already been laid off or transferred.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chamique Holdsclaw had 20 points and 13 rebounds
Thursday as the United States beat Slovakia 89-62 to gain a spot
opposite Brazil in the final of the women's World Basketball
Championships.
	   Brazil, which beat the United States 110-107 to win the 1994
title, advanced to Saturday's title game with a 72-70 victory over
Lithuania.
	   Slovakia led 19-18 with 8:59 left in the half when Holdsclaw,
the college player of the year but a rookie in international play,
sparked a 15-5 run that put the Americans in control.
	   ``Our depth definitely was a factor,'' coach Nell Fortner said.
``Chamique Holdsclaw stepped up big for us. DeLisha Milton stepped
up big for us.''
	   Milton added 11 points, five rebounds and three assists.
	   ``It is very difficult to defense this team,'' Slovakian coach
Natalia Hejkova said, ``because they have 12 very good players.''
	   Natalie Williams had 14 points and nine rebounds in 15 minutes,
Dawn Staley had 11 points and Katie Smith 10.
	   Zuzana Kamekova and Martina Luptakova led Slovakia with 12
points each and Renata Hirakova added 11.
	   Lithuania gave Brazil a scare, leading 59-58 with 7:41 to play
before experience paid off. Alessandra Santos de Oliveira had 24
points, Leila de Souza Sobstral 19 and Janeth Arcain 13 as Brazil
pulled away to an eight-point lead. Two 3-pointers in the last 14
seconds by Lithuania served only to reduce the margin.
	   Jurgita Streimikyte led Lithuania with 21.

American tire giants set to burn rubber in Montreal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The Canadian Grand Prix, the only Formula One
race in North America, could be Goodyear's last chance to say ``au
revoir'' to the circuit on home soil.
	   The Akron, Ohio-based tire giant is leaving F-1 after 33 years
of burning rubber in the series.
	   ``It was a business decision we made last fall, for a couple of
different reasons,'' said Steve Myers, Goodyear's race tires
marketing director. ``One, the cost of Formula One kept increasing
at a very high rate. And they were changing the rules.''
	   In only its second season on the circuit, Tennessee-based
Bridgestone has won all but one Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher
drove Goodyear to victory at Argentina.
	   ``Tires really have made a difference this year,'' Bridgestone
spokesman Woody McMillin said.
	   Goodyear will continue to supply tires to NASCAR, CART and IRL
teams as well as some drag racing divisions. Those circuits are
much more popular than Formula One in the United States, and much
cheaper. A top F1 team spends upwards of dlrs 100 million a year,
about four times the cost of running in the American-based series.
	   Goodyear's racing division also was displeased that F1 mandated
grooved tires this season to slow the cars.
	   ``The rule change forced us to spend a tremendous amount of
resources trying to make a tire that would comply,'' Myers said.
``Every other area of racing we compete in is smooth tires.''
	   Of course, some might argue that Goodyear was forced out by the
quick success of the competition.
	   Bridgestone, which bought Firestone in 1988, is the first
tiremaker to give Goodyear a true run in Formula One. Before this
season, Goodyear had won about 65 percent of its races and 25
series championships since 1965.
	   ``I can't comment on why they left, but I would prefer they stay
in,'' McMillin said. ``From our viewpoint, it's better to have
competition than not.''
	   While every indication is that Bridgestone will have a tire
monopoly in Formula One next season, McMillin isn't ruling out a
comeback by Goodyear.
	   ``We've heard Goodyear is reconsidering their commitment,''
McMillin said. ``What we've heard is they may not sit out a year.
They may be back in '99.''
	   Goodyear says only that this F1 farewell tour is taking nothing
away from its drive to win races.
	   ``There's been no pullback, no scaledown for any development for
Formula One this year,'' Myers said. ``Everyone is focused on
developing a tire for the next race.''
	   Whether it's the engines, drivers or tires, the McLaren-Mercedes
team of Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard has been utterly dominant
this season _ on Bridgestones.
	   Points leader Hakkinen has won six races while Coulthard has one
victory. Along with the Benetton team, the McLarens switched to
Bridgestones after Goodyear announced last fall it was leaving the
circuit.
	   Schumacher, the defending race winner at Montreal, gave Goodyear
a boost with a surprising victory in Argentina, saying a new, wider
design ``helped us close the gap.''
	   Schumacher trails second-place Coulthard by only five points in
the standings heading into the 30th Canadian Grand Prix. The
spotlight will again shine on defending series champion and native
Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, who arrived in Montreal Wednesday
fresh from an appearance on ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
	   Villeneuve would prefer to forget last year's trip to Montreal,
during which he was lambasted for criticizing Formula One officials
and was knocked out of the race by an uncharacteristic mistake on
the second lap. Villeneuve is another driver struggling on Goodyear
tires, having the worst year of his career for the
Williams-Mecachrome team.
	   After positive testing results last week, Villeneuve hopes to
end an eight-race winless streak in front of his adoring home fans.
	   ``It's the most important race of the season for me,''
Villeneuve said. ``I'm looking at it as a turning point.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology stocks rallied Thursday, embarking on
another recovery bid, while the broad market reversed a recent
trend by opening weak and finishing strong. The Dow Jones
industrial average erased an early 54-point loss and rose 66.76 to
8,870.56, with most of the gain coming over the final two hours of
trading. Most broad-market indexes also bounced back from a morning
stumble. The Nasdaq composite bucked the trend from the outset as
investors rummaged among popular technology names that have been
slammed this week. (US-CLOSING-STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank welcomed Indonesia's sweeping debt restructuring agreement.
They said Thursday it would it would give the troubled Asian
nation's hard hit economy some breathing room and benefit its
people. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the accord on
dlrs 80 billion worth of offshore debts owed by Indonesian
companies should help relieve pressure on the country's currency,
the rupiah, and ``revive trade and economic activity'' in the
country. Indonesia has been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis
that began last summer. The rupiah has lost 70 percent of its value
against the dollar, the banking system is near collapse, and
interest rates have skyrocketed to more than 60 percent. (IMF-WORLD
BANK-INDONESIA)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York State banking authorities voted
Thursday to allow the United Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank
Corp. to combine their New York operations. The approval from the
New York State Banking Board came six months after the combination
first was proposed. It had been delayed by complaints that the two
banks, along with a third bank Credit Suisse, were not negotiating
in good faith with heirs of Holocaust victims who claim the banks
owe them money. The dormant accounts of such people also have been
the subject of a class-action lawsuit, several international
investigations and a debate over whether U.S. financial officers
should boycott the large Swiss banks. In April, the banks agreed in
principal to negotiate a ``global settlement'' of all
Holocaust-related claims. (US-SWISS BANKS)
	   MIAMI (AP) _ An Aruban businessman identified by U.S.
authorities as one of the world's top money launderers pleaded
innocent Thursday to currency and drug smuggling charges at his
first appearance in a U.S. court. After staying beyond the legal
reach of the United States for five years, Randolph Habibe was
flown to Miami last week following a change in Aruban extradition
rules last October. U.S. Magistrate Judge Linnea Johnson ordered
Habibe, 54, to be held without bond for trial. If convicted of the
most serious racketeering charge, he could face 10 years to life in
federal prison. Habibe became a superstar in international
money-laundering circles by getting as much as dlrs 800 million in
drug profits back to Colombian drug cartels since 1980, U.S.
Customs Service agents charged. (US-TOP LAUNDERER)
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union took another step toward
making its single currency a reality Thursday when finance
ministers from 11 nations launched a new body to coordinate
economic policy in the euro era. EU Finance Commissioner
Yve-Thibault de Silguy said those 11 nations that adopt the euro as
their shared currency on Jan. 1 should cut budget deficits more
than forecast, to take account of Europe's quickening economic
recovery. He said the 11 euro nations should aim for an average
deficit of 2 percent of gross domestic product this year and 1.5
percent of GDP in 1999. That compares to current forecasts of 2.4
percent in 1998 and 2 percent for next year. The evening meeting
was the first for the so-called ``euro-11'' council which was set
up tighten consultations between the 11 nations in the first group
to switch to the euro. (EU-EURO)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five longstanding nuclear powers urged
India and Pakistan on Thursday to step back from the brink of a
nuclear arms race by keeping their bombs and missiles in storage
and coming to the bargaining table to resolve decades-old disputes.
The five also rejected conferring permanent membership in the
``nuclear club'' upon India and Pakistan, saying that would
encourage other nations to defy global arms reduction efforts.
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who chaired the meeting,
said India and Pakistan must take the lead in solving their own
differences. (UN-INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews expecting to find more
bodies labored to disentangle a high-speed train from the wreckage
of a bridge Thursday, while authorities pointed to a wheel failure
as a possible cause of Germany's worst post-war rail disaster.
Deutsche Bahn took all 60 of its first-generation InterCity Express
trains out of service as they finished their runs Thursday, idling
more than half of the nation's fastest trains. At least 100 people
died, according to Lower Saxony state officials, when the
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 crashed and broke apart at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour Wednesday morning in Eschede, a
small town 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The long-stalled Mideast peace process showed
signs of movement Thursday, with hopeful assessments from both
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. American officials, who have expressed impatience with
Israel in recent weeks, expect a decision from Netanyahu within
days on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank. The Palestinians have already accepted the plan, which
has yet to be made public. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A three-week hostage drama ended
Thursday with a right-wing paramilitary group's announcement that
it had killed 25 people abducted from an oil-refining city and
incinerated their bodies. The statement from the paramilitary group
in northern Santander state said the victims were executed after
they were tried and convicted of belonging to two guerrilla groups,
the National Liberation Army and the Popular Liberation Army.
Colombian President Ernesto Samper called the mass slaying ``a
barbaric act.'' The killings in Barrancabermeja, about 165 miles
(265 kms) north of Bogota, represented the first known attack on
civilians in an urban area by the paramilitary groups, who are
blamed for a heavy share of the human rights abuses in Colombia.
(COLOMBIA-MASSACRE)
	   DENVER (AP) _ Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison
Thursday after refusing to reveal new information about how he
helped Timothy McVeigh plan and pull off the Oklahoma City bombing.
U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch imposed the sentence after
listening to survivors and relatives of victims describe how the
worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil left their lives in ruins.
Matsch had indicated he would consider a lesser sentence if Nichols
answered lingering questions about the bombing. In court, however,
Nichols declined an opportunity to speak. Matsch said Nichols and
McVeigh were on a campaign to disrupt and intimidate the U.S.
government. Nichols, 43, was convicted Dec. 23 of involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy in the April 19, 1995, bombing that
killed 168 people and injured hundreds. He was acquitted of murder
and weapons offenses. (US-OKLAHOMA BOMBING)

Wonder, 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, and Casanova. Some items may
also have moved as separates.  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Julie Andrews says reports of her singing voice's
death are greatly exaggerated.
	   After the star of ``The Sound of Music'' and ``Mary Poppins''
had surgery last year to treat painful nodules in her throat,
reports circulated that she would never sing again. But Thursday,
she insisted any damage to her singing voice was not irreparable
and she was merely taking a year off.
	   ``It's like an athlete that takes a season out, and that's what
I'll be doing,'' she said. ``Much has been made of it that wasn't
exactly true. ... It's not as disastrous as people were led to
believe.''
	   The 62-year-old actress' speaking voice will be a part of the
musical stage version of ``Dr. Doolittle,'' which opens in London
next month.
	   Andrews will lend her recorded voice to the multilingual parrot
Polynesia, who teaches the show's star to talk to the animals. The
advantage of playing Polynesia is obvious, she said: ``I will be
able to add `bird' to my resume.''
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ OK, don't be cruel.
	   Lisa Marie Presley, 30, signed an exclusive recording contract
with Java Records, a joint venture between Capitol Records and
Grammy-winning producer Glen Ballard, the companies announced
Thursday.
	   ``Lisa Marie and I met through a mutual friend ... and I was
struck by her intelligence, her talent and her passion for music,''
Ballard said.
	   Asked if Miss Presley would be a rock 'n' roller like her
father, her publicist Paul Bloch said he didn't know what kind of
music she would be doing.
	   Capitol Records spokeswoman Judi Kerr was also in the dark. ``I
have no idea. I am as intrigued as anybody else,'' she said.
	   There was no information on a release date for her debut
recording.
	   ___
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Livin' for the city isn't enough _ certainly not
for parents of school-age children, according to Stevie Wonder.
	   ``It's so important that we _ adults, parents _ get involved in
the greatest legacy we have, the only legacy we have,'' Wonder told
about 1,000 people gathered outside the Breithaupt Vocational
Technical Center on Wednesday. ``That is, our future, our
children.''
	   The Michigan native, who was a pre-teen when he had his first
hit with Motown Records, was named ``parent ambassador'' for the
school on Detroit's west side.
	   Wonder, a father of three now living in Los Angeles, pledged to
maintain close contact with Breithaupt and return a year from now
for graduation ceremonies.
	   ``I love you all,'' he said. ``This is my home, and so my
commitment is in what I will do.''
	   Before he left, Wonder offered an a capella rendition of ``I
Just Called To Say I Love You.''
	   ___
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The director and composer of the movie
``Zorba the Greek'' will join other Greek notables on the honorary
committee that will oversee the 2004 Olympic Games.
	   The government announced Thursday the make-up of the National
Committee, which has the symbolic mission to ``rally the nation
around the Olympic goal.''
	   Michael Cacoyannis, the film director, and composer Mikis
Theodorakis joined a host of cultural icons and politicians who
will serve on the committee.
	   Other members include Gianna Angelopoulou-Daskalaki, the popular
conservative who headed Athens' bid for the 2004 Games; singer
Agnes Baltsa; Jules Dassin, who directed the film ``Never on
Sunday'' and was married to Greek actress Melina Mercouri;
basketball standout Nikos Gallis; and philanthropist Dolly
Goulandris.
	   The committee will formally inaugurate preparations for the
Games at a meeting in Ancient Olympia, the birthplace of the
Olympics, on June 20.
	   ___
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Even in death, Casanova can still
reel them in.
	   Fans of the infamous womanizer, whose full name was Giovanni
Giacomo Casanova, gathered Thursday in the Czech town of Duchcov to
mark the 200th anniversary of his death.
	   Women and men alike have been pouring by the hundreds into the
Duchcov Castle, where the world's most renowned lover spent the
last 13 years of his life, to take part in a four-day program of
cultural and social events devoted to Casanova.
	   ``We've even had several package tours from abroad,'' including
several busloads from Italy, said Tatjana Badriasvili, an employee
at the castle 60 miles (95 kilometers) northeast of Prague.
	   Fans of Casanova, who boasted of having more than 100 lovers,
can also lay wreaths at his original grave at Duchov's St.
Barbara's church.
	   His body was later reburied at an unknown location.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru will spend dlrs 627 million to rebuild
highways, bridges, homes and schools destroyed by floods and mud
slides caused by El Nino-driven rains.
	   The money will also be used to rebuild agricultural
infrastructure, President Alberto Fujimori said in a television
address late Wednesday.
	   Torrential rains brought by El Nino began pounding much of north
and central Peru in mid-December and continued until the end of
April.
	   There are no official figures on the damage, but the private
Center for the Study and Prevention of Disasters has said that 374
people have died and more than 400 have been injured in the floods
and mud slides.
	   ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A cholera outbreak in the aftermath of El
Nino has killed seven people and sickened 1,300 in Ecuador, and
health authorities warned on Thursday that it could become an
epidemic.
	   The first cases appeared in early March after El Nino-driven
rains caused flooding that washed away infrastructure and left
thousands homeless without safe drinking water.
	   Marcelo Aguilar, director of Ecuador's Health Ministry, said
residents must boil water before drinking it or using it to prepare
food, and must wash food well before eating it if they hope to
avoid an epidemic.
	   Cholera, which is spread through contaminated water, causes
vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Victims can recover if treated in
time.
	   Ecuador suffered a cholera epidemic in 1991 that killed 710
people and sickened 52,000, according to government figures.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The wife of Sandinista leader Daniel
Ortega rejected allegations that the former Nicaraguan president
sexually abused her daughter and asked human rights officials on
Thursday for protection against the ``defamation.''
	   Rosario Murillo, Ortega's wife, asserted that her daughter is
being pressured to make the claims for ``political ends.''
	   Zoilamerica Narvaez, 30, filed a lengthy statement with human
rights officials last week alleging that she had been molested by
her stepfather since she was 11 years old. Narvaez said her mother
``knew perfectly well'' of the abuse.
	   Murillo, accompanied by Ortega's 90-year-old mother, submitted
an injunction request before the Nicaraguan Center for Human
Rights, asking for protection from defamation, moral damages, and
slander stemming from the allegations, which she says has unjustly
opened her family to ``public jeering.''
	   Ortega, leader of the leftist Sandinista National Liberation
Front that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, served as
president from 1979 to 1989.
	   Ortega has not responded publicly to Narvaez's allegations.
Murillo said he would do so next week.
	   ___
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Mexican officials have urged the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights to clarify the rights of
people detained in foreign countries, especially prisoners
condemned to death.
	   Mexico hopes the court, based in the Costa Rican capital, will
clarify whether foreign prisoners have the right to meet consular
officials of their home country upon their arrest. They also want
the court to define whether the death penalty can justly be applied
to foreigners.
	   The court is to take up the issue in sessions beginning Monday.
	   Mexico has objected to several death sentences in the United
States arguing that prisoners were not allowed to contact Mexican
officials. In April, Honduras and Paraguay protested U.S.
executions of their citizens, asserting their rights under
international conventions had been violated.
	   Mexico abolished the death penalty in 1929, except for military
cases.

	   SALTA, Argentina (AP) _ Argentine schoolchildren singing the
Bolivian national anthem?
	   For some 30 grade-schoolers in this northern province, it
happens everyday since their school is located in neighboring
Bolivia.
	   Disturbed that the Argentine children knew the history and
national anthem of Bolivia and not its own, the provincial
government announced Tuesday that construction would begin on a
school closer to the tiny border town of Madrejones.
	   The move comes several days after a Buenos Aires daily published
a detailed account of how the town's kids travel by horseback
across the Gran Tarija river to a Bolivian school.
	   For the students, the trip is shorter than the 20 kilometers to
the nearest Argentine school.
	   Construction will begin in 15 days and cost dlrs 100,000, said
Salta's Minister of Education, Antonio Lovaglio.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Call it Ro-Ro II.
	   Brazil's Ro-Ro was Ronaldo and Romario. Inter Milan will have
Ronaldo and Roberto.
	   Roberto Baggio that is.
	   The 31-year-old former Juventus and AC Milan star looks certain
to move to Inter from Bologna, where he scored 22 goals last
season. Inter sources say the two clubs have agreed terms and
Baggio, recalled to Italy's World Cup squad after only one game for
the national team since 1995, could sign a two- or three-year deal
within the next few days.

	   TOUR DU PIN, France (AP) _ Death threats aside, Colombian star
Victor Hugo Aristizabal looks like making it to the World Cup
starting lineup.
	   After his name appeared on the squad, the striker received
menacing telephone calls from volatile fans who didn't think he was
good enough.
	   Coach Hernan Dario Gomez received phoned death threats too.
	   Aristizabal has been on the bench for recent games but Gomez
looks set to start him in the first World Cup game against Romania
June 15 in Lyon.
	   ``Undoubtedly, the team improved with Aristizabal. He is a
modern player, who helps in midfield and supports the strikers,''
Gomez said.
	   ``He has good skills, change of pace, helps Harold Lozano in
midfield, closes spaces... He is a key player.''

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian World Cup players Lucian
Marinescu and Catalin Munteanu are to team up with countryman
Bogdan Stelea at Spanish club Salamanca.
	   The deals will go through after the World Cup and Rapid
Bucharest reportedly will receive dlrs 1.3 million for Marinescu
and Steaua dlrs 2.5 million for Munteanu.
	   Goalkeeper Stelea played for Salamanca last season.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A fifth Brazilian World Cup triumph will worth
60,000 pounds (dlrs 109,000) to a British gambler.
	   The anonymous man has placed a 20,000 pound (dlrs 32,200) bet on
Brazil to win the World Cup at odds of 3-1.
	   According to bookmakers Corals, the gambler will collect 80,000
pounds (dlrs 132,800), including his stake money, if the defending
champion Brazil wins the title again.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The traditional sights of Paris _ the Eiffel Tower,
Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame, Kobe Bryant.
	   Kobe Bryant?
	   Travelers arriving in Paris for the World Cup are greeted by two
familiar sights as they enter the capital from the north.
	   To the right, gleaming white atop Montmartre, is Sacre Coeur,
the Roman Catholic basilica visited by millions of worshippers and
tourists each year.
	   To the left, decked in yellow and purple, is Bryant, the young
star of the Los Angeles Lakers, taking up the side of a building in
an advertising mural for Adidas.
	   In the bumper-to-bumper traffic that usually clogs the
expressways in that area, the 26-meter(80-foot)-high Bryant is
harder to miss that Sacre Coeur.
	   ___  
	   LONDON (AP) _ Never mind he was out of shape. Paul Gascoigne had
a broken cheekbone anyway.
	   The unpredictable 31-year-old England star, who was dropped from
England's World Cup star because he simply wasn't fit to play such
a gruelling championship, was examined Wednesday at a private
clinic, where the injury was confirmed, according to the tabloid
Sun.
	   Gascoigne led England to the semifinals of the 1990 World Cup
but has been frequently injured since then. He's also been
criticized for an erratic personal life that's included
hard-drinking and late-night carousing with celebrity friends.
	   ___  
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Didier Deschamps, captain of World Cup
host France, expects a tough final warmup game Friday even though
opponent Finland didn't make it to the championship.
	   ``We are not accustomed to playing them,'' the experienced
Juventus midfielder said. ``But I think the team has good players,
among them Jari Litmanen against whom I have played in the
Champions League where he has been with Ajax.
	   ``After three weeks preparations, the game against Finland is
important because it is the last repetition of what we've done,
before we start the World Cup against South Africa,'' said
Deschamps, whose team didn't impress in games against Belgium and
Morocco last week.
	   ___  
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ For 12 years he was the star
attraction of the World Cup. Now retired and facing a serious of
legal setbacks, Diego Maradona has yet to decide if he will travel
to France or in what capacity.
	   ``This is not the best time for Diego,'' his manager Guillermo
Coppola said Wednesday. ``It's the first World Cup in a long time
that he won't be playing and he is sad.''
	   Coppola said the former captain of the Argentine national team
was working through a ``deep depression'' and had not decided if he
would travel to France.
	   Maradona has reportedly been offered jobs by television networks
in Argentina, Italy, and Mexico to serve as a commentator during
the month-long competition.
	   ___  
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Optimism was evident as the U.S. soccer team,
facing a tougher draw, departed for France on Thursday.
	   ``Four years ago, we hoped we'd do well. This time we expect
it,'' said Tab Ramos, who is playing in his third World Cup. ``But
we have two of the best teams in the world in our group. For us to
advance to the second round, we will have to upset a very good
team.''
	   Those two teams are European champion Germany, which has won the
World Cup three times, and the dangerous Yugoslavia.
	   To beat those teams, the United States will have to improve on
its scoring. The team has scored 14 goals in 12 games this year,
posting a 6-3-3 record primarily on the strength of its defense and
goalkeeping from Kasey Keller, who has four consecutive shutouts.
	   Injuries to key personnel have affected the team's transition to
a new offense that features six midfielders and only one forward.
But Sampson said Thursday that midfielders Claudio Reyna, Frankie
Hejduk and Brian Maisonneuve have all healed after missing last
weekend's warmup match against Scotland with injuries.

Hartwig breaks a barrier in the pole vault and joins a select club

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France (AP) _ Jeff Hartwig joined a high flying club
with only a few members.
	   Hartwig became only the eighth pole vaulter to clear 6.00
meters, a metric barrier that athletes compare to the four minute
mile.
	   ``All the vaulters are chasing that mark. There are about seven
Americans over 19 feet in the vault but only one over 6 meters,''
Hartwig said.
	   He set an American pole vault record Thursday, soaring 6.00
meters - 19 feet, 8 1/4 inches - at the St. Denis international
track meet.
	   Hartwig bettered the mark of 5.98 meters (19-7 1-2) set in May.
1996 by Lawrence Johnson.
	   Sergi Bubka has the outdoor record of 20-1 3-4, or 6.14. He is
also the only man to clear 20 feet - 6.10.
	   ``He is THE master. He is the greatest. I look at my
accomplishments and they are so slight compared to his,'' Hartwig
said.
	   ``He is actually one of my heros in the sport,'' Hartwig said.
``He has jumped more than 100 times over 5.90 or higher. I have
done it four times.
	   ``This is my first six meters. He did 6.0 meters over 10 years
ago,'' Hartwig said.
	   ``For him it is not so special. For me it is great excitement.
	   Besides Bubka and Hartwig, the other six members of the 6-meter
club are
	   Russians Igor Trandenkov, Rodion Gautallin, Maxim Tarasov and
Dmitri Markov, South Africa's Okert Brits and Germany's Tim
Lobinger.
	   Hartwig, a 30-year-old from Arkansas State and Jonesboro,
Arkansas, missed twice at 6.00 then went over on his third attempt,
hitting the bar on his way over.
	   ``I was close on my first two attempts and I thought I have to
be patient with the jump and make things happen,'' Hartwig said. ''
I stayed with the pole to get all the energy on my third jump and
went right over it.''
	   He knew he was only a matter of time since this was the fourth
time he was trying for 6.0 meters.
	   ``I jumped at it in Australia, this year at Drake Relays and the
Prefontaine meet.I was close in Drake and in Eugene. It was really
close,'' Hartwig said.
	   ``That is one of the most difficult things to do is having the
opportunity to jump 6 meters in competition. I tried to keep it out
of my mind that it was 6 meters or an American record. I just look
at it as if it's the next height.''
	   In other races, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco won the 1,500
meters in 3 minutes, 32.34 seconds, no where near his best. He had
four races under 3:30 last year and was unbeaten for the year and
took the world title away from Noureddine Morceli.
	   Two-time world cross-country champion Sonia O'Sullivan of
Ireland was soundly beaten in her 5,000 race, finishing third
behind Zohra Ouaziz of Morocco and Gete Wami of Ethiopia.
	   O'Sullivan won both the long and short distance races in a
double at the world cross country meet in Morocco in March.

Trading in shares of Kankaku Securities halted on media report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Friday it will
suspend trading in shares of Kankaku Securities Co. for the day
after a newspaper reported that Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank would boost
its stake in the second-tier securities company.
	   The bourse is also suspending Kankaku's convertible bonds
trading Friday.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest, reported in its morning
edition that Dai-Ichi Kangyo's combined stake in Kankaku will rise
after the capital increase to 54 percent from the current 30
percent.
	   The bank is one of Japan's largest.
	   The deal would be the first in which a major bank acquired a
securities company as a subsidiary since Japan's Antimonopoly Law
was revised last year to allow such holdings by banks, the Yomiuri
said.
	   A Kankaku Securities spokesman said that the company had no
immediate comment on the report, but that it planned to hold a
press conference later in the day.

Wilma the greyhound just keeps running
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wilma the greyhound may not be good at the sprint,
but in the marathon, she is in a class of her own.
	   Wilma came last in her race at a greyhound track in Poole,
southwest England, earlier this week. But when the other dogs eased
up after the race, Wilma, just like Forrest Gump, kept on running.
	   That was three days ago, and by Friday her owners and the police
still hadn't found her.
	   Newspapers reported Thursday one public sighting of Wilma, when
a baffled motorist telephoned police to say he had been overtaken
by a greyhound on a road five miles (8 kilometers) from the Poole.
	   Wilma, a 19-month old greyhound who raced under the name
Cavecourt Blue, came a solid last in the 9.07 local time race on
Tuesday, but when the handlers were collecting the dogs, she put on
a burst of speed and jumped through the stadium's gates.
	   ``Cavecourt Blue didn't return to the handlers like the others.
She jumped the wall and just took off. The dog didn't seem to have
been frightened by anything in particular - I suppose she just
decided to leg it,'' the Daily Mail quoted hare driver Trevor
Ashworth as saying.
	   Police said that Wilma still was wearing her orange running
jacket with number 5 strapped on the back, and the stadium has now
offered a 200 pound (dlrs 300) reward for information leading to
her return to trainer Jo Burridge.
	   Burridge, who has been training her since April at her kennels
in southwest England, said that she was worried about the dog's
health.
	   ``I'm just baffled by it all to be honest,'' she said.
	   Wilma, who will be two years old in September, came to Britain
from Ireland and has raced four times in her short career. In her
first outing she was knocked over by another greyhound. She came
third in her second race, and finished last in her next two
outings.

Air France strike into fifth day as labor unrest spreads

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup approaching, Air France
officials and pilots worked early Friday to end a strike that has
threatened to disrupt the global soccer tournament.
	   The third round of talks between Air France and pilots' unions
began at the company's Paris headquarters at around 7 p.m. Thursday
and continued into the night. There were no signs of an immediate
breakthrough as the strike entered its fifth day Friday.
	   But Air France spokesman Francois Brousse, speaking to reporters
after the meeting began, said there were ``constructive
foundations'' for an agreement to prosper.
	   The pilots also were optimistic. Christian Paris, a spokesman
for the leading SNPL pilots' union, predicted ``significant
advances.''
	   In a show of force, several hundred striking pilots, arms
crossed and in full uniform, stood by the building as officials
entered for the talks.
	   The pilots are prepared to strike for at least 15 days,
coinciding with the start of the June 10-July 12 soccer
championship which will attract an estimated 1 million visitors.
	   Despite the strike, Air France, the World Cup's official
carrier, has guaranteed transport for the 32 teams taking part.
	   With just six days until the World Cup begins, France is plagued
by labor disputes.
	   On Friday, rail workers were set to begin a strike which was to
last through the weekend, seriously hampering rail travel through
France.
	   Paris subway drivers and railway workers in southern France also
staged minor strikes Thursday, heaping further misery on visitors
who have already arrived in France for the World Cup, as well as
other tourists.
	   Baggage handlers have been on strike for three days at Charles
de Gaulle airport in Paris, and airline mechanics also planned a
walkout.
	   The transport woes were causing embarrassment and anger among
French officials who feared for the country's image.
	   Michel Charasse, a Socialist senator, accused the pilots of
being ``egotistical, and not loving their country.''
	   ``It's a question of putting yourself before France,'' he said
in an interview with radio station Europe 1.
	   Leading conservative lawmaker Philippe Seguin said the strike
risked making France ``the laughing stock of the entire world.''
	   The pilots are striking to protest planned salary cuts. Their
wages are considered among the world's highest in the sector. The
company wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts.
	   The strike posed a big test for the Socialist-government of
Lionel Jospin. But the government was standing firm.
	   The airline ``has the full support of the government,'' the
Socialist finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told the
National Assembly.
	   The company said it planned 17 percent of its usual
long-distance flights on Friday, 30 percent of its short and
medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40
percent from Orly.

U.S. fast food, Italian pasta dominate World Cup despite French
</HEADLINE>
tradition  
  By RAF CASERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ France's vaunted gastronomy is
taking some hard tackles at the World Cup.
	   An American fast food chain is a chief sponsor of the Coupe du
Monde and even the members of the French team are turning their
backs on the national food during the World Cup.
	   A sip of Bordeaux perhaps? Quel horreur!
	   Any of the 704 players coming to France with ideas of enjoying
some of the famed dishes and wines are in for a big disappointment.
	   In any World Cup team worth its name, the chefs don't rule the
kitchen. Nutritionists and medical staff do.
	   ``My chief is the doctor,'' said French team cook Andre Bisson.
No point in letting that gastronomic intuition flow.
	   He has an acclaimed eatery a few kilometers from the French
training camp in the Rambouillet woods southwest of Paris, an area
teeming with restaurant with fatted goose liver, chocolate mousse
and cream-smothered escargots on the menu.
	   ``Thank God he doesn't serve the players his usual menu,'' said
national team coach Aime Jacquet.
	   Instead Bisson has gone Italian on the French team, giving them
a steady diet of pasta and olive oil instead of potatoes and cream.
``Foie gras? No, no,'' he said with a pained expression.
	   The 52-year old even became an intern again, at an Italian
restaurant in Lyon, just to learn the tricks of the pasta trade,
figuring out an al dente tagliatelli up to the second.
	   ``The trick is to make them want to eat,'' he said.
	   Despite the temptations at home, the French have long been at
the forefront of healthy eating habits in soccer.
	   When coach Arsene Wenger went to Arsenal last year to turn the
London team around in spectacular fashion, one of the first things
he attacked were the cakes and ales that ran through the eating
habits.
	   This season, on his way to a league-cup double in England,
Wenger even called his players up at 5 a.m. once for their plate of
pasta, making sure his players would have everything needed ahead
of an early kickoff.
	   It's all a far cry from the hamburgers of McDonald's, the U.S.
fast food giant which is one of the World Cup's major sponsors.
	   ``It is hard to reconcile with the food habits of athletes,''
admitted Florence Taieb, spokeswoman for McDonald's.
	   Just ask England's Paul Gascoigne how fast food and great
performances match. Unable to curb his love of fatty kebabs and
beer, he was cut from the team last week, shocking the whole
nation.
	   Having McDonald's so prominent in France's biggest sporting
event ever has touched a raw gastronomic nerve in a nation where
transatlantic relations are rarely smooth.
	   It even became an issue in the national parliament.
	   ``The Coupe du Monde should have been the moment to show off our
traditions and savoir-faire,'' fumed Sylvia Bassot of the
right-wing UDF party. Instead it will be ``minced meat and
ketchup.''
	   ``How can we let American hamburgers represent French gastronomy
before billions of television viewers,'' she said.
	   McDonald's has a sponsorship deal with the FIFA world soccer
federation, which allows it to advertise inside the 10 World Cup
and there was nothing the French organizing committee could do
about that. Almost all food will be provided by local
restaurateurs.

Dozens of Germany's fast trains idled after crash

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years.
	   Rescue crews worked through the early-morning hours to recover
bodies from the last major part of wreckage to be excavated, a
dining car that was buried when an overpass collapsed during
Wednesday's pileup.
	   State officials said at least 100 people were killed when the
Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884 derailed near the small town of
Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   There has been no indication of human error, but a break in a
wheel is emerging as the possible cause of the accident, said Horst
Stuchly, president of the federal railway office.
	   After jumping the tracks at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour,
the ICE crashed into part of the bridge and sparked a smash-up of
train cars.
	   ``I remember only that people and seats were all over the
place,'' an unidentified woman told NTV television in one of the
first interviews with one of the scores of injured survivors
evacuated to hospitals in helicopters.
	   ``A glass pane fell on me, and I was lying on top of somebody,
and all around was chaos,'' said the bandaged woman, speaking
softly from a hospital bed. ``As I later lay there in silence, the
door was open and I watched the sky, until the first helicopter
came.''
	   State officials said 200 people were injured, of whom 95 were
treated in hospitals.
	   Ninety bodies had been recovered at the scene, and three people
had died in hospitals.
	   There was no immediate count for additional bodies pulled from
the dining car because the remains were too mangled, crisis
management spokesman Klaus Weswe said early Friday.
	   Further excavation of bridge parts was halted until mid-morning
to give exhausted crews a break, Weswe said, adding that rescuers
did not expect to find any more survivors. He said train parts
remained under the collapsed bridge, but not an entire first-class
car as previously had been reported.
	   Deutsche Bahn said it was removing all 60 of its
first-generation InterCity Express trains, introduced in 1991, from
service after they finished their runs Thursday, idling more than
half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   Forty-three trains built since 1996 remained in service. It was
unclear how quickly normal service would resume.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said.
	   Earlier, officials had lowered the speed limit for all ICE
trains from 280 kilometers (175 miles) per hour to 160 kph (100
mph) until the entire fleet could be inspected.
	   There were one- to three-hour delays Thursday along the
2,175-mile ICE system, which links Germany's key cities and give
business commuters a convenient alternative to the country's
clogged autobahns.
	   A spokeswoman for the federal transport ministry told The
Associated Press that a broken wheel on the first car behind the
lead locomotive may have been a factor in the accident. She did not
elaborate.
	   Stuchly also cited a broken wheel, and said that part of the
train derailed 300 meters (yards) before the train reached the
overpass.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.
	   Officials said it appeared that the fifth car of the 12-car
train hit the bridge as it went through. The back end of the car
was broken off; the fourth car veered off the rails and rolled onto
its side, while three other cars jackknifed further up the line.
	   The lead locomotive remained on the tracks and the driver
apparently was unaware of the incident, coming to a stop only after
the station master at Eschede activated an emergency brake. The
rest of the train was squashed beneath or against the collapsed
overpass.
	   Officials said a detailed, forensic investigation would begin
only after all victims had been removed the debris.
	   Authorities set up a reception center for worried relatives in a
sports hall in Eschede. The window shades were drawn and a sign
warning ``No Press'' was attached to plastic sheets covering the
door.
	   Bodies and body parts were taken to Hanover for identification.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,''
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people who gathered
Thursday evening for a memorial service at the town's Lutheran
church, the Johanniskirche.

Ruling party wins lopsided victory in Korean local elections
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL SHIN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung's ruling
coalition celebrated a lopsided victory Friday in local elections
seen as a referendum on his first 100 days in office.
	   Kim's party and its coalition partner took 10 of the 16 mayoral
and gubernatorial posts at stake in Thursday's local elections,
including the key race in Seoul, the capital.
	   While the elections had no direct bearing on national politics,
both Kim and his opponents saw the balloting as a vote on the
president's efforts to revive the nation's sagging economy.
	   Local media said the victory would strengthen Kim's political
clout, spurring him to push political and economic reforms more
vigorously. Kim had appealed for wide support on the eve of his
departure for the United States, where he will try to drum up new
investment for South Korea.
	   Final tabulations showed that Kim's minority party, the National
Congress for New Politics, won six mayoral and gubernatorial posts,
while its coalition partner, the United Liberal Democrats, took
four.
	   The majority opposition Grand National Party won six posts but
only in its political home turf in the nation's south and
southeast.
	   Political analysts said the victory by Kim's party in Seoul and
its surrounding areas would likely prompt many opposition
legislators from the region to defect to the ruling camp.
	   The president's coalition is a minority in the National Assembly
and he has accused the opposition majority of stalling a number of
economic reform measures.
	   Ko Kun, a former prime minister, won the Seoul race. Ruling
party candidates also swept 20 of the 24 district posts at stake in
the capital.
	   Lim Chang-yul, a former finance minister, was elected to the
governorship of the populous Kyonggi province surrounding Seoul, a
region seen as a neutral yardstick for national politics.
	   Although regionalism and charges of personal wrongdoing
dominated the election campaign, South Korea's deepening economic
woes weighed heavily in the voting, analysts said.
	   Voter apathy toward politicians of all stripes was evident. Only
52.6 percent of the 32.5 million eligible voters cast ballots, the
lowest in nearly four decades.
	   Since the country called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to bail out its economy, inflation and unemployment have
been rising sharply. The number of jobless people has doubled to
nearly 1.5 million.
	   Kim's opponents have said he is too eager to please foreign
investors at the expense of local firms and have demanded
re-negotiation of stringent terms of the IMF bailout. Kim urged
patience to overcome the economic crisis that erupted during the
previous government.

Seles satisfied, not enthusiastic, after big win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Monica Seles had just returned to the French Open
final for the first time since 1992 and won for the first time
against Martina Hingis, the world's top player.
	   Yet, though she flashed a big smile after her 6-3, 6-2 victory,
there was none of the giddy enthusiasm she had as a teen-ager while
winning the tournament three straight times in the early 1990s.
	   Seles is playing in her first tournament since her father died
of cancer on May 14.
	   ``I do feel happy. I mean, it's really great. But I've tried to
keep a sense of balance,'' said Seles, who pumped her fist in
triumph after Thursday's win. ``I'm still going to be missing
people. Some things in my life are not going to be better.''
	   She'll face Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Saturday's final. Sanchez
Vicario celebrated her 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport by blowing a kiss to her Yorkshire terrier,
Roland, who watched from the VIP box.
	   Seles is 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario, a two-time French Open
champion.
	   The men's semifinals today feature three Spaniards and an
unseeded Frenchman. Carlos Moya faces Felix Mantilla and Alex
Corretja plays Cedric Pioline, trying to become the first Frenchman
to win at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.
	   Seles is wearing her father's ring on a chain around her neck
and has worn black throughout the French Open. Although the outfit
was chosen before her father's death, she said the color is
fitting.
	   ``I'm really glad it's not a bright color, because it just feels
more appropriate,'' Seles said. ``I try to give respect to Dad.''
	   Seles, who slammed two-handed winners within inches of the
lines, had lost all five previous matches against Hingis _
including a loss in the semifinals here last year.
	   Hingis had been overpowering in her run to the semifinals, not
losing a set in the tournament and having little trouble with
eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   But the sixth-seeded Seles was in control throughout, moving
Hingis all over the court with shots that skimmed just over the
net.
	   ``She just hits everything very hard and very aggressively from
every place on the court,'' Hingis said. ``Usually she makes more
mistakes or she gets a little bit tired, but today she just
didn't.''
	   Seles was the aggressor from the start, showing her intensity by
walking back on court first after every changeover. Hingis,
normally composed, scolded herself and bounced her racket on the
clay in frustration.
	   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive,'' Seles
said. ``I knew I had that in me. I wasn't sure if I could do that
today, but I really believed I could.''
	   Hingis won every Grand Slam title last year except the French
Open, losing in the final to Iva Majoli. She said Seles, who at 24
is seven years older than Hingis, ran her to exhaustion.
	   ``I was probably getting a little bit tired. She just made me
run, and she didn't make any mistakes,'' Hingis said. ``I guess she
surprised everybody.
	   ``I mean, she was around for quite a while, then all of a sudden
she was gone for years,'' Hingis added. ``And here she is back, in
better shape and probably better than ever.''
	   Seles was 17 when she won her first Grand Slam title at the 1990
French Open, the first of three straight championships at Roland
Garros. She ruled women's tennis in those years, her victories
punctuated with high-pitched grunts. Off the court, she was a
teen-ager with an infectious giggle.
	   But all that changed in April 1993, when a spectator came out of
the stands at a tournament in Germany and stabbed her in the back.
Seles didn't return to the tennis tour until August 1995, and even
then she was subdued and emotionally strained.
	   The last two years have been even tougher because of the failing
health of her father, Karolj, who until shortly before his death
was her only coach. She was at his side in Sarasota, Fla., when he
died.
	   ``Obviously, the last five years have been very difficult in
terms of walking on the court, while before I only had to worry
about winning or losing the tennis match,'' she said. ``It's not
the same as it was before the stabbing. It never will be, and I
don't want it to be.''
	   The other women's semifinal included 15 service breaks in 21
games. Davenport held her serve just twice in 10 attempts and also
was inconsistent with her groundstrokes.
	   ``I know she was very tired, and I just had to just hang in
there,'' said Sanchez Vicario, whose dog lapped up a lunch of ham
and bread chunks while sitting with Sanchez Vicario's mother in the
stands.
	   Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario made one of her
trademark remarkable saves and sent back a high defensive lob.
Davenport had an easy putaway, but her overhead slam sailed wide.
	   ``I guess I beat myself,'' Davenport said, ``but she kind of
forced it on me.''

UN inspectors seek to rally Security Council support, Butler to
</HEADLINE>
Iraq next week  
  Eds: RECAPS previous  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. arms experts have nearly accounted
for all Iraqi chemical artillery shells but ``fairly large gaps''
remain in other weapons areas which must be closed before sanctions
can end, the chief U.N. inspector says.
	   Richard Butler said Thursday he will go to Baghdad next week to
tell the Iraqis what specific disarmament steps they must take
before he can recommend the Security Council terminate the
eight-year embargo.
	   Butler spoke to reporters Thursday after a two-day briefing to
the council in which U.N. experts sought to refute Iraqi claims
that they have destroyed all long-range missiles and chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons.
	   That is the chief condition Iraq must meet before the council
will end the sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf War.
	   Butler has been under pressure from France, Russia and China to
certify Iraq is free of banned weapons or prove otherwise. U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's briefing proved that
``Iraq is deceiving ... the Security Council'' and ``this must stop
if it expects to get sanctions lifted.''
	   U.N. officials said the briefing was designed to explain in
detail the complicated disarmament issues at stake in Iraq.
	   But U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
briefing was part of a ``power struggle'' within the council
between the Americans and Britons _ who have been strongly critical
of Iraq _ and the Russians, French and Chinese who have been
sympathetic to Baghdad's position.
	   Those five countries are permanent council members and have
strongly entrenched positions regarding Iraq. Each faction is
trying to win support among the 10 non-permanent members.
	   Russia and France have signed lucrative oil contracts which
would kick in when sanctions are lifted.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
French Ambassador Alain Dejammet pressed Butler to say when his
inspections might and and raised questions about some of his
conclusions.
	   Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun said Beijing wanted inspections to
wrap up as soon as possible to alleviate suffering among Iraq's 22
million people.
	   In Baghdad, Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rashid, accused
Butler of bad faith and renewed claims that Baghdad has complied
with U.N. orders.
	   ``If they have information (about weapons), let them give it to
us,'' Rashid told The Associated Press on Thursday. ``We will
verify it.''
	   But Butler said ``the onus of proof is not on us,'' adding that
it was Iraq's responsibility ``to tell us what they have
truthfully, so that we can verify that.''
	   ``In some cases, the gap is very small,'' Butler said. ``We are
on the edge of accounting for all special warheads. I expect that
in a matter of weeks. But, if you look at some parts of the
biological file, the gap, I'm afraid, is fairly large.''

  Eds: UPDATES with Lomu withdrawal; RECASTS  

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Jonah Lomu's hopes of playing the
rugby union tests against England received a setback Friday when he
was ruled out of Monday's All Blacks trial.
	   Lomu, the star of the 1995 World Cup, is suffering a foot
injury. He missed most of last season because of a kidney disease,
returning late in the year on New Zealand's British tour.
	   But All Blacks coach John Hart admitted recently that Lomu was
one of a few All Blacks under extreme pressure to hold onto their
places this season.
	   Lomu missed the Super 12 final where his Auckland team lost to
Canterbury.
	   Fellow Auckland player Michael Jones was also ruled out of the
trial because of a sternum injury.
	   Canterbury captain Todd Blackadder replaces Jones at blindside
flank and Wellington winger Tana Umaga takes up Lomu's spot in the
shadow test team. Lomu is

Shareholders vote on selling Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest old marque of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, looks like it's about to have German bosses behind the
wheel.
	   Shareholders in corporate parent Vickers PLC were scheduled to
meet Friday to vote on Volkswagen AG's 430 million pound (dlrs 700
million) bid for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. that management has
accepted.
	   The deal appeared headed for approval, after a tough fight
against rival bidder BMW and emotional objections from some
Rolls-Royce and Bentley owners who did not want to see the producer
of the fabled hand-made cars fall under foreign ownership.
	   BMW's bid of 340 million pounds (dlrs 554 million) came up
short, although the German luxury carmaker has threatened to mess
up Volkswagen's plans by withdrawing BMW engines it supplies to
Rolls-Royce.
	   Volkswagen moved Thursday to help seal the purchase _ and to
fight off any threat on the engines _ by agreeing also to buy the
engine maker Cosworth from Vickers for 120 million pounds (dlrs 196
million).
	   That would give VW a foothold in Britain's high-performance
engine industry, though it probably wouldn't be a cure-all if BMW
actually follows through on its threat.
	   Two groups of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts claimed Thursday they were
still trying to put together bids, and they won a concession from
Vickers chairman Sir Colin Chandler.
	   Chandler met with them in the morning and said they could submit
bids late, even after the shareholders' meeting, although he said
Vickers would not entertain any offers that would take too long to
finalize.
	   Vickers hopes to close the sale by July 3, and one group of the
British enthusiasts said they'd like to trump the Volkswagen bid
within a few days.
	   ``The goal is to keep Rolls-Royce motors as a British-owned
company, producing Rolls-Royce and Bentley motor cars in the Crewe
factory with the existing brilliant workforce,'' said Donald
Longmore, a doctor involved in that effort.
	   Ever since Vickers put Rolls-Royce on the market last year,
analysts have predicted that the Germans would win the deal and the
British auto enthusiasts would merely add a bit of color to the
race.
	   Many Britons have been frustrated in recent years to see so many
of the country's institutions fall under foreign ownership _ and
the Rolls-Royce lovers tried to draw the line at their beloved
maker of cars that cost a bundle but are reputed to keep on rolling
almost forever, in almost total silence.

Dollar higher, stocks lower in early Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Friday, while Tokyo stocks slipped on continuing pessimism
over the Japanese economy.
	   The dollar bought 138.56 yen, up 0.40 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 138.27 yen
overnight.
	   Steady buying of the German mark against the yen helped buoy the
U.S. currency higher.
	   But traders said dollar-yen trading will likely be locked within
a narrow range for the rest of the Asian day because of growing
nervousness ahead of the release of U.S. employment data later
Friday and next week's meeting of deputy finance ministers from
Group of Seven nations.
	   Early Friday, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Japan will
carefully watch the dollar-yen rate, and if necessary, may make the
yen's weakness a topic of discussion at the G-7 meeting.
	   On the stock market, the bleak outlook for the Japanese economy
continued to weigh on sentiment, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 65.93 points,
or 0.43 percent, to 15,360.54 after the first hour of morning
trading. On Thursday, the index had gained 79.47 points, or 0.52
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.29 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,204.21.
The TOPIX rose 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, the previous day.
	   On Thursday, port harbor transport company Mitsui Wharf applied
to the Yokohama District Court for protection from creditors,
increasing pessimism about the health of Japan's companies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond edged down to 1.125 percent from Thursday's finish
of 1.135 percent, driving its price up to 112.61 yen from 112.54
yen.

Few incentives, no sanctions as nuclear club keeps out India,

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Despite standing together to try to end the
India-Pakistan arms race, the five longstanding nuclear powers
acknowledged they have only taken the first step to ``bring them
back from the brink.''
	   ``We have no illusions,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told reporters after an emergency meeting Thursday with
her counterparts from Britain, China, France and Russia. ``But the
process has begun.''
	   A joint statement demanded the South Asian neighbors refrain
from further nuclear tests and resolve their differences with
direct talks.
	   The spate of tests last month failed the countries across the
board, said Albright. The governments worsened security for Indians
and Pakistanis and lost the respect of other countries.
	   ``They might not have expected this kind of very widespread
condemnation of what they have done,'' she said.
	   They also didn't make it into the nuclear club, the officials
said.
	   ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons
states in accordance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,''
the joint statement said.
	   Albright, who initiated the meeting at the U.N. European
headquarters, stressed there was no question of amending the treaty
for India and Pakistan. That ``would mean that any nation can test
its way in,'' she said.
	   But ``we are not going to try to turn these two countries into
pariahs,'' she said.
	   The ministers offered to help India and Pakistan, especially
over Kashmir, the disputed territory that has been the flashpoint
of two of the country's three wars.
	   But the main responsibility for making peace is theirs, said
Tang Jiaxuan of China, who chaired the meeting. He quoted a Chinese
proverb: ``It is up to the one who tied the knot to untie it.''
	   The text threatened no new sanctions, but was long on the two
countries' responsibilities.
	   Prime among those was the unconditional signing of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by both countries.
	   India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to
export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to
weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them,
the communique said.
	   ``We are prepared to help India and Pakistan maintain peace if
they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said Albright.
	   But, she added, ``they'd better stop, look and listen'' to the
message delivered Thursday by the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council.
	   The ministers didn't even discuss sanctions, which the United
States has been alone among the five in imposing.
	   Sanctions only hurt the people and neighboring countries and
``have little effect on leaders who often act in isolation and
sometimes unpredictably,'' said Russia's Yevgeny Primakov.
	   U.S. officials said Albright wanted to make sure Russia's
traditional leaning toward India and China's support for Pakistan
did not prevent the five powers from producing a strong joint
statement.
	   But in his comments, Tang placed the blame for the crisis
squarely on India.
	   ``In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went
ahead with its nuclear tests,'' Tang said. ``After the peace and
stability in the South Asian region had been undermined, Pakistan
also carried out nuclear tests.''
	   Hubert Vedrine of France dismissed suggestions that China could
be considered a strategic threat to India. ``China has behaved in a
perfectly equitable way,'' he said.
	   The statement hammered out Wednesday night by experts from the
five countries was approved ``without change or controversy'' by
the officials Thursday, according to British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook.

Witnesses, paparazzi, Al Fayed converge on Paris courthouse
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECAPS pvs. Court session scheduled to begin at 0730 GMT.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A simple, tragic car accident, caused by a drunk
driver. Is that the whole answer?
	   That's what Judge Herve Stephan will try to find out Friday when
the key witnesses in the Princess Diana case, the photographers
under investigation, their lawyers, and Mohamed Al Fayed all
converge on Paris' main courthouse.
	   Stephan has summoned the parties for a closed-door hearing to
try to clarify the main question in the case: Who was at fault?
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But what was the responsibility of the paparazzi trailing
Diana's Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and a press motorcyclist have been placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for
both manslaughter and failing to come to the aid of a person in
danger.
	   Those close to the case believe the photographers will soon be
exonerated _ at least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed, plans to attend. He has
filed as a civil party in the case, and therefore has access to
documents and proceedings.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   In a statement issued by his spokesman in London, Al Fayed said
Thursday he is ``determined to get to the truth'' about whether the
crash was an accident or a plot to kill Diana and his son.
	   ``I will not rest until I am satisfied that what happened was
God's wish and not the wish of someone else,'' he said, according
to spokesman Lawrie Meyer.
	   But French judicial sources said recently that Al Fayed has
backed off his contention that the crash stemmed from a plot, and
now thinks the paparazzi are to blame.
	   A documentary broadcast Thursday on Britain's Channel 4
television reported that Ritz barman Alain Willaumez said that
senior hotel managers asked him to say that Paul had been drinking
fruit juice and showed no signs of being drunk before the crash.
	   ``It was important to stick to this version for the good of the
royal family,'' Willaumez said in a statement to French police,
according to the documentary. Later, the bartender went back to the
police and told the truth, the report said.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators have long
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have long given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   Investigators also recently conducted road tests on a race track
near Paris to reconstruct the crash. Police released no details of
those tests.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

Japan's banks, burdened with bad debt, haven't mended their ways
</HEADLINE>
  By MARTIN FACKLER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ They're the biggest banks in the world. And their
debts are bigger than the entire economies of Indonesia, Thailand
and Singapore combined.
	   Eight years after Japan's economic bubble burst, its banks are
still wallowing in an estimated dlrs 550 billion in bad loans.
	   Whether they will be able to scale their mountain of debt is a
crucial factor in Japan's overall economic recovery and in reviving
Asia as a whole.
	   But analysts say Japanese bankers still haven't learned their
most important lesson _ how to lend money profitably.
	   ``They don't pay attention to risk,'' said Naoko Nemoto, a
banking analyst at Standard and Poor's rating service in Tokyo.
	   Economists agree that reckless lending and cronyism were behind
the financial meltdown that humbled Asia's tigers _ Indonesia,
South Korea, Thailand and others _ and threatens to derail economic
growth in the United States and elsewhere.
	   They also believe that Japan's banks are guilty of similar sins.
	   Instead of carefully screening loans and seeking maximum returns
for depositors and shareholders, they have fallen over themselves
to give money to land speculators and poorly run companies.
Borrowers are often chosen based on personal introductions or
longtime business links.
	   Such unwise lending got Japan's banks into their present bind _
the bulk of their bad debt comes from the collapse of land prices
in the early 1990s, which drove thousands of borrowers into
bankruptcy.
	   Yet, the same practices persist.
	   More than 40 percent of all loans by Japan's largest banks last
year went to the bloated and risky construction and real estate
industries. Many loans by U.S. banks, by contrast, go to
middle-class home buyers, who rarely default.
	   The reason why Japan has been able to muddle along while other
Asian nations had to go hat in hand to the International Monetary
Fund is simple: Japan has the world's largest pool of cash.
	   Countries like Thailand and Indonesia, on the other hand, are
dependent on overseas money to fuel their economies. And when
foreigners decided Asia's financial problems were too risky, those
countries suddenly found themselves strapped for cash.
	   Japan has been blessed by the prodigious savings rate of its
workers, who sock away more than one yen, the national currency, in
every eight, almost three times the U.S. rate.
	   As a result, Japan's banks sit on huge piles of cash. The Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., for instance, is the world's largest
bank, with dlrs 583 billion in assets. Chase Manhattan Corp. is the
largest U.S. bank in terms of assets, with dlrs 365.52 billion as
of Dec. 31, 1997.
	   But, analysts warn, Japan's banks are rapidly wasting this
birthright. While assets at Japan's 12 largest banks total dlrs 3.7
trillion, that sum has shrunk by 6 percent _ erasing dlrs 242
billion _ in the last six months of 1997.
	   Jim McGinnis, senior banking analyst at the Tokyo branch of
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said Japan's banks are squandering their
depositors' wealth by making loans that not only don't earn enough
interest but often fail outright.
	   Japan's economic bind is made all the more difficult by the fact
that it can't rely on its old strategy for pulling out of downturns
_ exporting.
	   A stricken Asia can't afford the luxury of Japanese goods, and
the U.S. trade deficit is hitting record highs. Asian economies are
cutting back on U.S. exports, while their weaker currencies make
their products cheaper in the American market.
	   Japan does have other alternatives, however.
	   Analysts say one would be a massive infusion of taxpayers' money
to help banks writeoff their bad loans once and for all, something
banks have put off as they waited for a rebound in land prices that
has yet to come.
	   Another would be tightening up the way Japanese banks do
business, from charging risky borrowers more to avoiding them
altogether.
	   And it means giving Japanese consumers alternatives for their
savings other than banks, such as more mutual funds or money market
accounts.
	   ``Japan needs nothing short of a structural revolution,'' said
McGinnis. ``It needs a growth in capital markets so banks stop
misallocating capital.''

Communique of the 5 nuclear powers on India-Pakistan tests
</HEADLINE>
  RETRANSMITTING  
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   The joint communique issued Thursday by the five longstanding
nuclear powers on the India-Pakistan nuclear tests:
	     ___
	   1. Bearing in mind the responsibility of their countries for the
maintenance of international peace and security, the foreign
ministers of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the
United States met in Geneva on June 4, 1998, to coordinate their
response to the grave situation created by the nuclear tests
carried out in May 1998 by India and then by Pakistan. The
ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep concern about
the danger to peace and stability in the region and pledged to
cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear and
missile arms race in the Subcontinent, to bolster the
nonproliferation regime and to encourage reconciliation and
peaceful resolution of differences between India and Pakistan.
	   2. The ministers agreed that quick action is needed to arrest
the further escalation of regional tensions stimulated by the
recent nuclear tests. India and Pakistan should therefore stop all
further such tests. They should refrain from the weaponization or
deployment of nuclear weapons, from the testing or deployment of
missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and from any further
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. They should
also halt provocative statements, refrain from any military
movements that could be construed as threatening and increase
transparency in their actions. Direct communications between the
parties could help to build confidence.
	   3. To reinforce security and stability in the region and more
widely, the five strongly believe that Indian and Pakistan should
adhere to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty immediately and
unconditionally, thereby facilitating its early entry into force.
The five also call upon India and Pakistan to participate in a
positive spirit and on the basis of the agreed mandate, in
negotiations with other states in the Conference on Disarmament for
a Fissile Material Cut-off convention with a view to reaching early
agreement. The five will seek firm commitments by India and
Pakistan not to weaponize or deploy nuclear weapons or missiles.
India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to export
equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to weapons
of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them, and
should undertake appropriate commitments in that regard.
	   4. The ministers agreed that the international nonproliferation
regime must remain strong and effective despite the recent nuclear
tests in South Asia. Their goal continues to be adherence by all
countries, including India and Pakistan, to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as it stands, without any
modification. This treaty is the cornerstone of the
nonproliferation regime and the essential foundation for the
pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Notwithstanding their recent
nuclear tests, India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear
weapons states in accordance with the NPT.
	   5. The ministers concluded that efforts to resolve disputes
between India and Pakistan must be pursued with determination. The
ministers affirm their readiness to assist India and Pakistan, in a
manner acceptable to both sides, in promoting reconciliation and
cooperation. The ministers pledged that they will actively
encourage India and Pakistan to find mutually acceptable solutions,
through direct dialogue, that address the root causes of the
tension, including Kashmir, and to try to build confidence rather
than seek confrontation. In that connection, the ministers urged
both parties to avoid threatening military movements, cross-border
violations or other provocative acts.
	   6. The ministers also considered what actions the five could
take, individually or collectively, to foster peace and security in
South Asia. They will encourage India and Pakistan to adopt
practical measures to prevent an arms race. They confirmed their
respective policies to prevent the export of equipment, materials
or technology that could in any way assist programs in India or
Pakistan for nuclear weapons or for ballistic missiles capable of
delivering such weapons. They also undertook to do all they could
to facilitate a reduction of tensions between those states and to
provide assistance, at the request of both parties, in the
development and implementation of confidence- and security-building
measures. They remain determined to fulfill their commitments
relating to nuclear disarmament under Article VI of the NPT.
	   7. The ministers viewed their meeting in Geneva as setting in
motion a process aimed at strengthening peace and stability in
South Asia, at encouraging restraint by India and Pakistan, at
promoting the resolution of outstanding differences and at
bolstering the international nonproliferation regime. They will
remain fully engaged in pursuing these goals and will work actively
to build broad support in the international community for the
objectives they agreed today.

Founder of company in world's biggest gold scam dies in Bahamas
</HEADLINE>
  By JESSICA ROBERTSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ David Walsh, founder of the disgraced
Bre-X Minerals Ltd., that attracted thousands of investors with
tales of the greatest gold find this century, died Thursday in a
Bahamas hospital. He was 52.
	   A spokeswoman for Doctors' Hospital in Nassau said Walsh died at
2:15 p.m. He suffered a stroke on Sunday, two days after the
Bahamas Supreme Court froze his assets at the request of trustees
handling his Canadian company's bankruptcy.
	   His death, long before the full story unravels, leaves lingering
questions about Walsh's role _ if any _ in one of the biggest stock
frauds in history.
	   The Montreal-born Walsh moved to the Bahamas and a
multimillion-dollar seaside estate after the collapse of the
company in May 1997, which he began working from the basement of
his Calgary home.
	   Walsh was the toast of Canadian entrepreneurs in the early 1990s
as he built the company from a penny-stock operation with reports
of a dlrs 26 billion gold find in Busang, Indonesia.
	   Bre-X stock was selling at dlrs 206 a share when the news struck
that samples from the mine had been doctored with gold bought from
local miners.
	   Private investigators believe the culprit was the chief
geologist, Michael de Guzman, who apparently committed suicide in
March 1997 by jumping from a helicopter near the Indonesian mine.
	   ``I am wiser and obviously more cynical _ four and a half years
of hard work and the pot at the end of the rainbow is a bucket of
slop,'' Walsh said ruefully after the fraud was exposed.
	   But investors, who stand to lose an estimated dlrs 6 billion,
remain bitter that Walsh and other company officials had cashed in
enough of their holdings to live the rest of their lives in luxury.
	   Walsh had apologized and professed his innocence in the scandal.
	   Lawyers for investors said earlier this week that legal actions
would go ahead with or without Walsh.
	   Lawsuits have been filed in Canada, the United States, the
Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, where Bre-X vice president John
Felderhof, who also was the company's senior geologist, moved after
the scandal broke. The bulk of the legal battles have been rolled
into two class actions suits, one in Ontario and one in Texas.
	   Before Walsh's Bre-X breakthrough, his life ranged from modest
success to absolute bust. He had earned a decent living as a
stockbroker before founding Bre-X.
	   Walsh, the son of Montreal stockbroker, and his wife, Jeanette,
declared personal bankruptcy in 1993.
	   Not long after, their luck changed and he began his incredible
rise to fortune with his old geologist friend, Felderhof, in the
Borneo jungle.
	   The Bre-X scandal earned Canada's stock markets a global
reputation as an unregulated frontier where mining frauds are
prevalent and easy to commit. Junior mining companies were
especially hard hit by the Bre-X fiasco.
	   Since May 1997, a barrage of shareholder lawsuits have been
launched against Bre-X and its senior officials, the Toronto Stock
Exchange, securities regulators and several brokerage firms which
promoted the stock.
	   The company itself was petitioned into bankruptcy in November
after an Alberta court refused to extend its protection deadline.
Walsh resigned as chairman shortly afterward.
	   Walsh's family was at his side when he died including his wife,
whose assets in the Bahamas also were frozen this week.

Good luck needed to get around Hanoi's streets
</HEADLINE>
  With FEA-Traffic-Motorbikes

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Motorbikes are the most popular form of
transportation on Vietnam's chaotic roads. An Associated Press
correspondent recently made his first foray on one of the little
scooters. Here is his report.
	   ___
  By PAUL ALEXANDER  
  Associated Press Writer  
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ To get around in Vietnam, you need good
brakes, a good horn and good luck.
	   That was my first lesson as I prepared to brave Hanoi's frenzied
streets on a motorbike.
	   In principle, it didn't sound tough. I once owned a 350-cc
motorcycle with six gears. How much trouble could I get into with a
little 100-cc, four gears and an automatic clutch?
	   A lot.
	   Motorbikes and bicycles comprise more than 95 percent of the
vehicles in Vietnam and are simply the best way to get around. The
office commute is quicker on two wheels than four, because it's
easier to negotiate narrow side streets.
	   But the possibility of bumps, bruises and broken limbs was often
on my mind as I surveyed traffic from our eighth-floor office and
marveled at the near-misses. I was told accidents are virtually
unavoidable, even for the most skillful and agile riders.
	   Just a week after I moved to Hanoi, the office photographer was
cut off at one of the traffic circles that look like angry
beehives, with vehicles converging from six directions. He dumped
his Honda Dream II _ the same model as mine _ and broke his
shoulder.
	   Feeling out of place in a high-tech, plastic foam helmet bought
in Los Angeles _ protective headgear is virtually nonexistent in
Vietnam _ I climbed on my motorbike one morning. I chose Sunday for
my first ride because weekday traffic was too daunting.
	   I'm not exactly huge at 5-foot-11 (180 centimeters) and 185
pounds (84 kilograms), but I do stand out among the shorter,
slimmer Vietnamese. Several times people have marveled at how
``fat'' I am, though I'm told it's a compliment because fat is a
sign of prosperity.
	   Taking a slow trial run around the parking lot, I realized my
legs were too long and my feet too big to use my left toe to
upshift and the heel to downshift. I had to reach back, toe first,
to downshift _ awkward, but doable.
	   Finally, my stomach as tight as my grip on the handlebars, I
rolled onto the street, quickly getting passed by honking
motorbikes and a couple of cars.
	   Gridlock is rarely a problem in Hanoi. On the contrary, traffic
rarely stops because most intersections are uncontrolled. I have
yet to see a stop sign, and stoplights are a recent phenomenon that
aren't always obeyed.
	   Only the most adventurous or foolhardy get much above 30 mph (50
kph), but everything seems to move much faster with people riding
wheel to wheel, making left turns from the far right of the street
and pulling into traffic without a glance.
	   Veteran riders can tell one horn from another, but I couldn't,
so each time I heard a beep, I had to check the mirror _ not
designed to see around a body as wide as mine _ to know how far
over to get while avoiding pedestrians and bikes.
	   By the time I reached the first intersection, sweat was running
down my sides, and not from the heat.
	   Somehow, I slipped into the honking flow and emerged on the
other side without coming within a foot (30 centimeters) or so _ a
mile (1.6 kilometers) by local standards _ of anyone else.
	   After a few blocks, I began to sense there was something of a
method to the madness. I relaxed a bit and quickly got a rude
reminder that I should never do that. A bicycle carrying two girls
from the opposite direction started a turn about 30 feet (9 meters)
in front of me.
	   Luckily, I was going slow and managed to screech to a swerving
halt less than an inch (about a centimeter) from their front wheel.
	   The rest of the three-mile (4.8-kilometer) trip _ which should
have taken 15-20 minutes but lasted 30 and seemed to go on for
hours _ was relatively uneventful.
	   I breathed a huge sigh of relief as I pulled into the office
parking lot and got a claim check from the attendant, who wrote the
corresponding number on the seat in chalk because so many
motorbikes look identical.
	   Then I started thinking about the fact that in a few hours, I'd
have to do the whole thing again to get home _ after dark.

Motorbikes remake Vietnam's transportation system
</HEADLINE>
  With FEA-Vietnam-Traffic Trauma  
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   When people in Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries,
can save a little money one of the first priorities is to move up
from the traditional bicycle.
	   Vietnam has imported 200,000 to 350,000 motorbikes annually in
recent years, and some are now assembled locally. So many are
Hondas that Honda has become a generic name for motorbikes.
	   Ho Chi Minh City, which had about 300,000 motorbikes before the
Vietnam War ended in 1975, now has about 1.4 million for its 5
million people.
	   Motorbikes serve as everything from the family car, carrying up
to two adults and three children, to a delivery truck hauling a
refrigerator or three full-grown pigs in baskets.
	   Kids riding with mom or dad work on their homework, munch a
snack or even doze. Commuters chat bike to bike. Shopping bags go
in a wire basket or are strapped down with elastic cords.
	   The number of traffic fatalities _ 6,152 last year for a
populace of 76 million _ is rising steadily.
	   On Highway 1, the two-lane road that runs virtually the length
of Vietnam, it's not unusual to see a car passing a truck passing a
motorbike passing a bicycle, all while a similar group is coming in
the other direction.

  By CHARLES J. HANLEY  
  AP Special Correspondent  
	   GUANICA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A U.S. Navy boat steamed into view,
fired off a three-pound (1.4-kilogram) gun and sent all of Guanica
_ Spanish soldiers, townsfolk, stray dogs _ scattering for the
scrubby green hills.
	   As simple as that: The U.S. conquest of Puerto Rico had begun.
	   Today, 100 years later, a McDonald's anchors the top of Calle 25
de Julio, named for that historic July 25. And at the foot of this
street of pastel houses, facing the sleepy Caribbean harbor where
the Americans arrived, a young man lounged on his porch one recent
noon, a sun-bleached U.S. flag tacked to the wall behind him, and
told a visitor what many in Guanica envision for Puerto Rico.
	   ``I want my beautiful island to become one of the states of the
United States of America,'' declared Efrem Cancel-Millan.
	   As simple as that: The 51st state in the 21st century.
	   But how easily will Puerto Rico now conquer America?
	   A century after the U.S. military _ in the name of ``manifest
destiny'' _ rounded up pieces of the Spanish empire in a 109-day
war, America still rules a far-flung collection of five island
territories whose destinies are anything but manifest.
	   And Puerto Rico, with 3.8 million people the most populous of
the world's remaining colonies, may have the least predictable
future of all.
	   ``They're a quirk of history,'' the Interior Department's Allen
P. Stayman, the Washington official chiefly responsible for
territorial affairs, said of the islands.
	   ``They never were a good fit. ... It's a 19th century status in
the 20th century.''
	   The four other territories _ three in the Pacific, another in
the Caribbean _ will closely follow the growing debate over Puerto
Rico's political status. Each has its own unique problems and
aspirations:
	   _Guam (population 146,000), also seized in the Spanish-American
War, doesn't seek statehood or independence, but is campaigning for
greater autonomy.
	   _The Northern Mariana Islands (64,000), taken from Japan in
World War II, has clashed with Washington over local control of
immigration and minimum wages, basis of a booming garment industry
built on labor from China.
	   _American Samoa (60,000), ceded to the United States by local
chiefs in 1900, is an economic backwater where the local
government's fiscal mismanagement has become a long-running
scandal.
	   _The U.S. Virgin Islands (114,000), sold to America by Denmark
in 1917, has an even worse fiscal record. Washington's auditors are
now investigating whether the present government mishandled
millions in federal funds.
	   America did not take on its island ``empire'' with an easy mind.
The treaty with Spain that ended the 1898 war, turning the United
States into a colonial power, squeaked through the U.S. Senate by
two votes.
	   In Puerto Rico, an independence movement grew in the early
decades, to be suppressed by governors appointed by Washington.
	   A temporary compromise was reached in 1952. The island was given
limited autonomy and dubbed a ``commonwealth,'' in which Puerto
Ricans elect a local government and pay no federal taxes, but have
no vote in Congress and pay substantial local taxes.
	   From a desperately poor island of coffee and sugar plantations,
Puerto Rico has evolved into an industrial society, with the help
of federal tax breaks for U.S. corporations. Acres (hectares) of
shantytowns gave way to suburbs, shopping malls and resorts.
	   But almost as many Puerto Ricans have migrated to the U.S.
mainland in search of work as remain on the island. Two-thirds of
those still here rely on some form of welfare. And their colonial
status still grates.
	   One example: After Congress balked at a Reagan administration
idea in the 1980s to cut food stamp benefits in the 50 states, it
imposed the cuts on Puerto Rico alone.
	   Now even one of the architects of the commonwealth structure,
Jose Trias Monge, warns its time may be running out, unless
Washington's power over island life is reduced.
	   ``Commonwealth status will in all probability soon lose its
support,'' the retired Puerto Rico chief justice writes in an
influential new book on the status debate.
	   That debate heated up in 1993 when an aggressive young governor
staged an island-wide plebiscite on the question.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello said the time had come for statehood, to end
Puerto Ricans' role as ``disenfranchised stepchildren'' of the
American family. Pro-commonwealth politicians countered that their
rival option, ``enhanced'' commonwealth, could bring both more
welfare aid and greater economic flexibility to the island.
	   By just two percentage points, plebiscite voters preferred a
stronger commonwealth over statehood. Independence received just 4
percent in the non-binding vote.
	   Rossello, undaunted, is now pushing legislation in Washington to
stage a more authoritative, federally sponsored plebiscite that
could, if the island's voters and the U.S. Congress agree, lead to
statehood within 10 years.
	   The 1898 takeover ``came with a promise of liberty and democracy
for Puerto Rico,'' Rossello said in an interview at La Fortaleza,
the grand 16th-century governor's mansion in San Juan. ``At the end
of that 100-year period, we are finally asking that that promise of
full democracy be implemented.''
	   He's confident ``significant majorities'' will develop in Puerto
Rico for statehood. But even if he's right, the picture in
Washington is less inspiring: After barely passing in the House on
a 209-208 vote in March, the plebiscite bill is all but stalled in
the Senate.

	   Congressional opponents object to even opening the door to the
possibility of a Spanish-speaking state. They complain that full
social benefits for Puerto Ricans might cost the government dlrs 3
billion more a year. They worry that statehood might incite violent
resistance by Puerto Rican ``independentistas.''
	   Many are also wary for a purely political reason. Six new Puerto
Rican members of Congress, almost certainly Democrats, would take
House seats away from other states.
	   Surveying the opposition, Rep. George Miller,
Democrat-California, long involved in territorial matters,
questions whether even a resounding Puerto Rican vote for statehood
would mean much.
	   ``I'm not convinced the Congress of the United States would
honor that commitment,'' he said in Washington.
	   Rejection is just fine with Ruben Berrios, head of the Puerto
Rican Independence Party.
	   ``When the statehooders get their first kick, which they will
get soon, they will realize the only way out is independence, the
dignity of independence,'' he said.
	   In some ways, the island already has the trappings of
sovereignty. Its single-star, red-white-and-blue flag flutters
everywhere, symbol of national pride. It has an anthem, ``La
Boriquena,'' that every child learns. It fields its own Olympic
team. It cheers for Miss Puerto Rico as she vies with Miss USA for
the Miss Universe crown.
	   But Puerto Ricans cling jealously to another birthright as well,
their U.S. citizenship. It's a symbol of security _ particularly,
everyone acknowledges, the security of welfare and other U.S.
government aid.
	   That's one reason people like Anibal Acevedo Vila, head of the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, believe Puerto Ricans
will not opt for independence.
	   Instead, ``the time has come for a fully autonomous and
democratic commonwealth,'' Acevedo Vila said. ``It would finally
balance our identity as a people with the U.S. citizenship we
cherish, and would give Puerto Rico the economic tools we need in
the next century for our own development.''
	   The ``tools'' he wants include the sovereign-like power to make
economic agreements with other nations, to draw new investment and
jobs.
	   Jobs will be needed. Congress voted in 1996 to phase out the tax
break supporting the Puerto Rico operations of U.S.-based
pharmaceutical and other manufacturers, whose factories employ
about 10 percent of Puerto Rican workers.
	   The debate will go on, not least in this quiet south coast town
on July 25, when an invasion of 50,000 people is expected for the
ceremony marking the centennial.
	   They'll include statehooders, commonwealthers, independentistas.
But many who live in Guanica, like the great middle ground of
Puerto Ricans everywhere, think more about their own futures than
the island's. And their futures are often tied to the United
States.
	   Chatting with teen-age friends down by the harbor, Carrie Cruz
Troche told an American visitor her plans.
	   ``To study more English. It's very important. And then to go to
the States. I want to be a teacher there,'' the 17-year-old student
said, as she stood where Americans landed in her country a century
ago and she plotted her own personal invasion of theirs.

Guam's lament: `We're a colony and it's embarrassing'
</HEADLINE>
  With FEA-Puerto Rico-Stepchild to America

<TEXT>
	   AGANA, Guam (AP) _ Tomorrow begins for America on this
reef-rimmed island west of the International Date Line. But Guam's
own future lies back where yesterday ends, in the halls of
Congress.
	   Guam's people are too few _ 146,000 _ and too distant _ 3,700
miles (6,000 kilometers) southwest of Hawaii _ to be considered for
U.S. statehood. But they do want a better deal from the government
whose Navy sailed into a peaceful harbor here 100 years ago to
wrest their island from Spain.
	   In the century since the Spanish-American War, Guamanians have
developed an awkward relationship with their superpower stepparent.
	   A place two-thirds the size of New York City, with white sand
beaches, 7,000 hotel rooms and a dozen military installations, Guam
is an unincorporated U.S. territory, meaning its residents are like
mainland Americans in some respects but not in others: They're U.S.
citizens who can serve in the U.S. military, but who have no vote
in presidential elections or on the floor of Congress.
	   Key decisions are made for Guam back where it's usually still
yesterday: on the other side of the date line in Washington, 14
hours behind Guam time. Congress decides, for example, which
federal regulations apply here (immigration) and which don't
(customs).
	   For the residents of this tropical outpost, who boast they live
``Where America's Day Begins,'' it's decidedly un-American.
	   ``The core, American democratic creed is that the only
legitimate form of government is by consent of the governed,'' said
Robert Underwood, Guam's delegate to the U.S. House. ``How do you
deal with the fact that the people on Guam are not participants in
the legislative process?''
	   Although Washington granted Guamanians some self-government in
1950 and expanded it in 1968, Congress retains ultimate power over
island life.
	   ``Any way you call it, we're a colony and it's embarrassing,''
said Gov. Carl Gutierrez, whose office became elective only in
1968. ``Nothing is in our hands. It's all in the United States'
hands.''
	   In a 1987 plebiscite, Guamanians voted overwhelmingly to seek a
new status, as a commonwealth, like Puerto Rico. Although
commonwealth has no standard legal definition, for Guam's leaders
it's a code word for greater autonomy from Washington.
	   The ``Guam Commonwealth Act'' has languished in Congress since
it was first proposed in 1988. But now a growing debate in Puerto
Rico over strengthening that Caribbean island's self-rule _ or
admitting it as a state _ is spurring Guamanians to push anew for a
better deal.
	   Among other things, the legislation would:
	   _Allow the indigenous Chamorros, almost half the population, to
voice a preference on Guam's political future in a Chamorro-only
plebiscite.
	   _Give Guam control over immigration, to stem what Chamorros see
as an overflow of Asian immigrants.
	   _Give Guam more control over its local environment, over excess
federal land and over establishment of military bases.
	   The proposal's ``Chamorro power'' elements have drawn the most
public criticism.
	   Activists among local Filipinos _ 30 percent of Guam's
population _ complain that Guamanian control over immigration could
keep immigrants from obtaining U.S. citizenship here and bar
non-citizens from owning land.
	   In addition, the Clinton administration objects to a
Chamorro-only vote, saying it would violate the voting rights of
non-Chamorros under the 14th and 15th Amendments.
	   In a pre-emptive move last year, the Guam legislature authorized
a Chamorro vote in 1998 on ``decolonization'' _ on whether the
island should pursue statehood, independence or a compact of free
association, whereby it would negotiate from a ``sovereign''
position to give back certain powers to Washington.
	   Washington inevitably will reject an all-Chamorro plebiscite,
but Guam is going ahead with it, though possibly postponed to 1999.
	   ``What we want is feedback from the federal government as to
what options they would engage us on,'' said Leland Bettis, head of
a Guam decolonization commission.
	   ``We're raising the volume a bit. Absolutely.''

United States and Brazil advance to semifinals

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chamique Holdsclaw had 20 points and 13 rebounds
Thursday as the United States beat Slovakia 89-62 to gain a spot
opposite Brazil in the semifinals of the women's World Basketball
Championships.
	   Brazil, which beat the United States 110-107 to win the 1994
title, advanced to Saturday's title game with a 72-70 victory over
Lithuania.
	   Slovakia led 19-18 with 8:59 left in the half when Holdsclaw,
the college player of the year but a rookie in international play,
sparked a 15-5 run that put the Americans in control.
	   ``Our depth definitely was a factor,'' coach Nell Fortner said.
``Chamique Holdsclaw stepped up big for us. DeLisha Milton stepped
up big for us.''
	   Milton added 11 points, five rebounds and three assists.
	   ``It is very difficult to defense this team,'' Slovakian coach
Natalia Hejkova said, ``because they have 12 very good players.''
	   Natalie Williams had 14 points and nine rebounds in 15 minutes,
Dawn Staley had 11 points and Katie Smith 10.
	   Zuzana Kamekova and Martina Luptakova led Slovakia with 12
points each and Renata Hirakova added 11.
	   Lithuania gave Brazil a scare, leading 59-58 with 7:41 to play
before experience paid off. Alessandra Santos de Oliveira had 24
points, Leila de Souza Sobstral 19 and Janeth Arcain 13 as Brazil
pulled away to an eight-point lead. Two 3-pointers in the last 14
seconds by Lithuania served only to reduce the margin.
	   Jurgita Streimikyte led Lithuania with 21.

New Zealand claims world first of extracting pure water from thin
</HEADLINE>
air  

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A Wellington-based company on
Friday claimed a technological breakthrough with a process that can
produce clean drinking water out of thin air.
	   Watermaster Technologies said its Airwell 2000 technology could
alleviate drinking water shortages anywhere in the world.
	   Developed jointly with Canterbury University, the Airwell 2000
can make up to 20 liters (5 gallons) of clean drinking water a day
simply by taking in the surrounding air, the company said at its
product launch.
	   It said world-wide research and patent searches had failed to
uncover any similar technologies apart from simple dehumidifiers.
However, the Airwell 2000 technology was considerably cheaper and
could operate in any humidity range.
	   In a three-stage process, the machine takes in air, extracts
water from it then purifies it by passing it through an electrical
filter and a charcoal filter. Most dehumidifiers don't produce
purified water.
	   The electrical filter destroyed any bacteria, while the charcoal
filter removed solid materials.
	   Watermaster managing director Dennis Waller said the Airwell
2000 ``has been developed to help meet the demand for clean water
created by health concerns in areas of good supply, as well as
water shortage and pollution problems.''
	   Waller said larger commercial versions of the machine could also
be built.
	   The machine would probably initially appeal to people concerned
about their health, but could also be used in areas where there was
a shortage of water, supply was poor or where there was pollution,
he said.

Drug conference to focus on combating money-laundering, developing
</HEADLINE>
alternate crops
  Eds: RECAPS pvs  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Curbing demand for narcotics and
combatting money-laundering will be among the main themes of a U.N.
drug conference which opens next week.
	   Leaders of drug-producing countries have argued that enforcement
measures and ``drug wars'' will be ineffectual unless those steps
are taken.
	   President Clinton will open the three-day ``Special Session on
the World Drug Problem'' with a speech Monday to the U.N. General
Assembly. Representatives of about 150 governments, including 35
heads of state or government, are also expected to attend.
	   They include French President Jacques Chirac, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer and
President Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   ``For the first time, we have the issue of demand reduction
included at the same level as other components of narcotics
control,'' Pino Arlacchi, head of the U.N. drug control office,
said Thursday.
	   Arlacchi said demand reduction includes measures to rehabilitate
addicts, discourage young people from taking drugs and ``a strategy
for an elimination or substantial reduction'' in the cultivation of
cannabis, poppies and other narcotic crops over 10 years by
offering alternative crops to farmers.
	   He said the European Community should expand its programs for
drug rehabilitation and developing countries should establish
treatment programs.
	   ``We think that the time has come to include some important
elements of the money-laundering issue,'' he added. ``We are
concerned about bank secrecy as an impediment to criminal
investigations worldwide and about the proliferation of tax havens
worldwide ... that provide secure havens and protection'' for drug
profits.
	   The goal will be to encourage individual national governments to
enact legislation in line with conference guidelines.
	   But critics have questioned whether the United Nations is
capable of mounting an effective program and whether the conference
will endorse an American-style ``war on drugs,'' which has failed
to achieve success.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in Bogota, Colombia,
Samper said his government has taken major steps to curb illicit
production. But he said drug trafficking cannot be curbed until
``consumer countries'' tackle ``reduction of demand, reduction in
money laundering and in the earnings of drug trafficking.''
	   The Catholic Institute for International Relations warned that a
strategy which emphasizes ``repressive anti-drugs policies'' and
ignores the needs of poor farmers is bound to fail.
	   Arlacchi said he had no intention of mounting a U.S.-style
``drug war'' on a global scale.
	   ``There is a kind of `U.S.-centric' vision of what is happening
in the world that should be overcome,'' Arlacchi said. ``I think
this is a wrong metaphor for every place.''
	   The United Nations estimates that two countries _ Myanmar and
Afghanistan _ account for 80 percent of the world's illicit poppy
production. The Islamic Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan, has agreed to let the United Nations begin monitoring
poppy cultivation in an attempt to discourage opium production.
	   Despite aggressive efforts to interdict drug shipments, the
United Nations estimates that law enforcement agencies would be
able to seize no more than 10 percent of heroin shipments and 30
percent of cocaine traffic worldwide.

Chase, Daiwa Banks to jointly sell investment product
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Daiwa Bank will enter into a limited tie-up
with Chase Manhattan Bank to sell an investment account to
individual savers from August, a spokesman for Daiwa said Friday.
	   Daiwa will collect money from Japanese savers looking for higher
returns than offered on simple bank accounts and pool it into a
trust fund which Chase will manage, said the spokesman, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Daiwa already offers many similar funds which it manages on its
own. The new fund would be different only in that Chase would have
full discretion in how to invest the money collected, the spokesman
said.
	   The tie-up would be the latest in a series between Japanese and
foreign financial institutions. U.S. and European firms are
scrambling to get a foothold in Japan as a series of deregulations,
known as the ``big bang,'' is expected to give foreign companies
greater access to Japan's huge pool of personal savings.
	   Chase will guarantee the principle amount on the yen-denominated
accounts, so that investors will get back what they originally
invested even in the case of severe market decline.
	   Demand for alternative savings funds from Japanese investors is
rising due to record-low domestic savings rates. Simple savings
accounts offer annual interest rates of less than 0.25 percent.

Dollar rises, stocks slip in Tokyo trading
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen's weakness against the German mark helped
push the U.S. dollar higher against the Japanese currency Friday
morning, while Tokyo stocks slipped on continuing pessimism over
the Japanese economy.
	   The dollar bought 138.72 yen, up 0.56 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 138.27 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said buying of the German mark against the yen,
apparently from investors in Singapore or Hong Kong, helped buoy
the dollar higher.
	   But traders said dollar-yen trading will likely be locked within
a narrow range for the rest of the Asian day because of growing
nervousness ahead of the release of U.S. employment data later
Friday and next week's meeting of deputy finance ministers from
Group of Seven nations.
	   Early Friday, Japan's Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said
finance authorities will carefully watch the dollar-yen rate, and
if necessary may make the yen's weakness a topic of discussion at
the G-7 meeting.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the bleak outlook for the Japanese
economy continued to weigh on sentiment, traders said, in continued
light activity.
	   On Thursday, Mitsui Wharf Co., a harbor-transport company,
applied to the Yokohama District Court for protection from
creditors, increasing pessimism about the health of Japan's
companies.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 64.88 points,
or 0.42 percent, to 15,361.59 points at the end of the morning
session. On Thursday, the index had gained 79.47 points, or 0.52
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.59 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,203.91.
The TOPIX closed up 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond edged down to 1.125 percent from Thursday's finish
of 1.135 percent, driving its price up to 112.61 yen from 112.54
yen.

Philippine inflation rises to 10.3 percent in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine consumer prices rose 10.3
percent in May from a year earlier using a new base year of 1994
instead of the previous 1988, the government said Thursday.
	   The consumer price index was also recalibrated to reflect
changing consumer spending patterns over the past decade, with
different weightings given to the goods and services that make up
the index. Food, beverage and tobacco continue to have the heaviest
weighting, but were reduced to 55.1 percent from 58.5 percent.
	   Using the old index, inflation in May was 9.2 percent after
April inflation was revised to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent. The
May figure was the highest since June 1996, when inflation was 9.8
percent.
	   The government has set an inflation target of between 7.5
percent and 8.5 percent for this year.
	   The government said the food, beverage and tobacco component of
the new CPI rose 8.9 percent in May from a year earlier while
services jumped 15.9 percent. Fuel, light and water rose 5.0
percent.

Cow stuck on highway halts traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A cow attempting to flee the auction block halted
traffic on a highway southwest of Tokyo for nearly an hour,
creating a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) traffic jam, police said Friday.
	   The westbound lanes of the Tomei Expressway were closed for 40
minutes after the hefty heifer became lodged in a narrow space
between a fence and the highway's guardrail, a police spokesman
said.
	   The cow had jumped the 1.5-meter (5-foot) fence after slipping
down from an elevated surface road, the spokesman said.
	   A prefectural, or state, highway patrol team rushed to the site
in Nagaizumi, Shizuoka Prefecture, about 100 kilometers (62 miles)
southwest of Tokyo. They used a crane to extract the pregnant cow,
which was then taken away by truck, said the spokesman, who asked
that his name not be published.
	   No injuries or damages were reported.
	   The cow had fled in an excited state while it was being weighed
for auction late Thursday.

Capitals 3, Sabres 2, OT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ No choking for the Washington Capitals
this time.
	   Joe Juneau's goal 6:24 into overtime lifted Washington to a 3-2
victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night, putting the
Capitals into the NHL Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in
their 24-year history.
	   Brian Bellows set up the game winner when he swept around Darryl
Shannon and tried stuffing the puck past Dominik Hasek. Juneau
eventually grabbed the loose puck and sent the puck under Hasek's
glove.
	   ``The puck was there,'' Juneau said. ``You want to go to the net
and hope the puck comes out, and it finally came out.''
	   Washington's Peter Bondra sent the game into overtime when he
redirected Andrei Nikolishin's cross-ice pass past Hasek with 5:59
remaining in the third period and the Capitals on the power play.
	   The Capitals, who have won seven of their last eight road games,
will play the winner of the Detroit-Dallas series for the Stanley
Cup starting next week. The Red Wings lead the Western Conference
series 3-2 with Game 6 set for Friday night in Detroit.
	   With the victory, the Capitals erased any doubts about whether
they would blow a 3-1 series lead for the fourth time in 11 years.
Washington allowed Buffalo to get back into the series by losing
Game 5 before finishing off the Sabres.
	   ``It's one of those things you have to fight through,'' Capitals
veteran center Dale Hunter said of the blown series of the past.
	   ``It's been a long time coming,'' added Hunter, who is seeking
his first NHL title in his 18th season. ``Having a chance to win
the Stanley Cup is an unbelievable feeling.''
	   Paul Kruse and Michael Peca scored for the Sabres, who were
looking for their first appearance in the Stanley Cup since 1975.
Esa Tikkanen scored the other goal for the Capitals, who won three
of their four games over Buffalo in overtime.
	   Buffalo had two good chances in overtime, but Capitals
goaltender Olaf Kolzig saved them as he had most of the game. He
made a toe save on Jason Woolley early in the extra period and
stopped Vaclav Varada on a breakaway.
	   Bondra's goal came moments after the Sabres had problems
clearing the zone when Nikolishin trapped the puck along the boards
and found Bondra alone in close. Bondra easily tipped the pass into
the open side, setting up the third overtime game of the series.
	   Buffalo had appeared to be in control when Kruse was credited
with a goal 7:40 into the period to give the Sabres a 2-1 lead. Bob
Boughner's rebound from the point got lost in traffic in front of
the net and went off Kruse before winding up in the net.
	   Bondra nearly had another goal earlier in the period when he
tipped a shot from the point off the crossbar. Michal Grosek almost
won it for Buffalo with 1:33 remaining in regulation when his wrist
shot rang off the post.
	   The game was shaping into another scoreless duel between Hasek
and Kolzig before Peca and Tikkanen each scored their first goals
of the series 22 seconds apart in the second period.
	   The Sabres thought they were on their way when Peca took Dixon
Ward's drop pass in the left circle and beat Kolzig with a
one-timer on Buffalo's 29th shot of the game with 6:56 left in the
period.
	   Tikkanen answered moments later when he deflected Mark Tinordi's
shot from the point into the short side while standing alone near
the crease to tie the game 1-1.
	   Kolzig had been perfect and kept the Capitals in the game before
allowing Peca's goal on a shot that went just under the goalie's
arm. Buffalo had thoroughly outplayed Washington and was peppering
Kolzig with shots through the first 33 minutes but could not pull
away.
	   After managing just 16 shots in all of Game 5, the Sabres tested
Kolzig 31 times in the first two periods and had far many scoring
chances than the Capitals.
	   Sabres forward Brian Holzinger was stymied three times alone,
twice on rebounds as Buffalo camped in front of the Washington net.
Buffalo had 10 straight shots at one point in the first period but
came away with nothing.
	   ``Any time you beat the best goaltender in the world, it's
satisfying,'' Kolzig said of Hasek, who led the Czech Republic to
the gold medal in the Olympics and had an NHL-leading 13 shutouts
this season.
	   Kolzig said the Capitals' veterans were the big reason they won
the series.
	   ``That's what got us through _ the character of the veterans.''

Dozens of Germany's fast trains idled after crash
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with confirmed death toll at 95; CORRECTS style for
network to n-tv, sted NTV.

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years.
	   The confirmed death toll rose to 95 after rescue crews recovered
two additional bodies early Friday from the last major part of
wreckage to be excavated, a dining car that was buried when an
overpass collapsed during Wednesday's pileup.
	   Police spokesman Peter Hoppe said rescuers did not expect to
find additional bodies.
	   State authorities originally had estimated that as many as 100
or more were killed when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884
derailed near the small town of Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles)
north of Hanover.
	   There has been no indication of human error, but a break in a
wheel is emerging as the possible cause of the accident, said Horst
Stuchly, president of the federal railway office.
	   After jumping the tracks at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour,
the ICE crashed into part of the bridge and sparked a smash-up of
train cars.
	   ``I remember only that people and seats were all over the
place,'' an unidentified woman told n-tv television in one of the
first interviews with one of the scores of injured survivors
evacuated to hospitals in helicopters.
	   ``A glass pane fell on me, and I was lying on top of somebody,
and all around was chaos,'' said the bandaged woman, speaking
softly from a hospital bed. ``As I later lay there in silence, the
door was open and I watched the sky, until the first helicopter
came.''
	   State officials said 200 people were injured, of whom 95 were
treated in hospitals.
	   Ninety-two bodies were recovered at the scene, and three people
had died in hospitals.
	   Rescue crews managed to reach parts of the dining car only after
carefully lifting a huge chunk of the collapsed concrete bridge
with cranes overnight.
	   Some train parts remained under the bridge, but not an entire
first-class car as previously had been reported, and no additional
bodies were expected, officials said.
	   Further excavation of the bridge was halted until later Friday
to give exhausted crews a break, crisis management spokesman Klaus
Weswe said.
	   Deutsche Bahn said it was removing all 60 of its
first-generation InterCity Express trains, introduced in 1991, from
service after they finished their runs Thursday, idling more than
half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   Forty-three trains built since 1996 remained in service. It was
unclear how quickly normal service would resume.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said.
	   Earlier, officials had lowered the speed limit for all ICE
trains from 280 kilometers (175 miles) per hour to 160 kph (100
mph) until the entire fleet could be inspected.
	   There were one- to three-hour delays Thursday along the
2,175-mile ICE system, which links Germany's key cities and give
business commuters a convenient alternative to the country's
clogged autobahns.
	   A spokeswoman for the federal transport ministry told The
Associated Press that a broken wheel on the first car behind the
lead locomotive may have been a factor in the accident. She did not
elaborate.
	   Stuchly also cited a broken wheel, and said that part of the
train derailed 300 meters (yards) before the train reached the
overpass.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.
	   Officials said it appeared that the fifth car of the 12-car
train hit the bridge as it went through. The back end of the car
was broken off; the fourth car veered off the rails and rolled onto
its side, while three other cars jackknifed further up the line.
	   The lead locomotive remained on the tracks and the driver
apparently was unaware of the incident, coming to a stop only after
the station master at Eschede activated an emergency brake. The
rest of the train was squashed beneath or against the collapsed
overpass.
	   Officials said a detailed, forensic investigation would begin
only after all victims had been removed the debris.
	   Authorities set up a reception center for worried relatives in a
sports hall in Eschede. The window shades were drawn and a sign
warning ``No Press'' was attached to plastic sheets covering the
door.
	   Bodies and body parts were taken to Hanover for identification.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,''
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people who gathered
Thursday evening for a memorial service at the town's Lutheran
church, the Johanniskirche.
	   Germany's deadliest train accident prior to Wednesday's
derailment came in 1967, when 94 people were killed after a barrier
closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline, causing it to
explode.
