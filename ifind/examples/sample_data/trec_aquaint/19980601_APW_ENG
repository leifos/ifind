Doohan calls for upgrade to 1000cc bikes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four-time world 500cc motorcycling
champion Mick Doohan has called for the establishment of a new
1000cc class, featuring four-stroke engines, to replace the
existing machines.
	   Doohan, who was second behind Spanish teammate Alex Criville in
Sunday's 500cc French Grand Prix, believes a move to 1000cc
four-stroke machines would attract new manufacturers such as BMW,
Ferrari and Ford to grand prix racing as engine builders and
suppliers.
	   The 500cc class is the top division for motorcycle racing, but
Doohan said the two-stroke V4 machines raced by Japanese
manufacturers Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki for the past 15 years faced
a limited future.
	   ``It seems to me the two strokes are reaching the end of their
era because the 500 V4s have been doing the same lap times for the
past five years,'' Doohan said Monday.
	   ``We're not making leaps and bounds forward anymore, the bikes
never really change, and people lose interest. There's been talk
about switching to four-stroke grand prix bikes and I think it
would be awesome to go to a 1000cc prototype.''
	   Doohan said changing up to 1000cc bikes with light, small
engines would make the sport more interesting, and more fun for the
riders.
	   ``Going to four-stroke prototypes would take the sport to the
next level and open up racing to other manufacturers like BMW, or
even Ford and Ferrari to build engines,'' Doohan said. ``Yamaha
made Formula One engines even though they don't build cars so it
could work the other way around.''
	   Doohan, who has won 48 grand prix races from 126 starts in the
500cc class since 1989, said a move to 1000cc four-stroke machines
would be expensive, but the benefits would justify the costs.
	   ``Racing four-strokes would cost more, but the manufacturers
aren't afraid to spend if it will do them good,'' Doohan said.
``It's no use trying to keep it cheap because this isn't club
racing. If some people can't afford to run four-stroke grand prix
bikes there's plenty of other championships for them to race in.''

Red Sox beat Yankees 13-7, Mariners defeat Devil Rays 11-6

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Boston Red Sox scored 11 runs in the third
Sunday, then had to rely on a sensational stop by rookie second
baseman Lou Merloni to beat the Yankees 13-7 Sunday.
	   Boston sent 16 batters to the plate in the inning, combining
nine hits and three walks _ plus three poor fielding decisions _
against Andy Pettitte (6-5) and Darren Holmes.
	   Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek each had a double and single
in the majors' biggest inning this season.
	   Pedro Martinez (6-1) turned over an 11-4 lead to the bullpen
with two outs in the sixth.
	   The Yankees scored three times in the seventh to make it 11-7
and had the bases loaded before second baseman Merloni made a
diving stop of a grounder to rob Jorge Posada of a two-run single
and start an inning-ending double play.
  Mariners 11, Devil Rays 6  
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, the Seattle Mariners went the
equivalent of nearly three games without a home run, then hit six,
including Ken Griffey Jr.'s 19th.
	   Rob Ducey ended a 26 2-3 inning drought with a homer leading off
the fourth against Rick White (0-1). Joey Cora, Edgar Martinez,
Russ Davis and David Segui also homered before Griffey finished the
power surge with a solo shot in the eighth off Albie Lopez.
	   Bill Swift (4-3), pitching a day ahead of schedule because Jeff
Fassero had a stomach virus, held the Devil Rays to three runs on
four hits in 5 2-3 innings.
  Rangers 9, Orioles 5  
	   In Baltimore, Juan Gonzalez hit his seventh career grand slam
and added a solo shot for his second straight two-homer game, to
lead Texas.
	   The five RBIs gave Gonzalez nine in two games and an AL-best 71
in just 54 games. Gonzalez's grand slam came in the third inning
off Scott Erickson (5-6) and gave the Rangers a 5-1 lead.
	   Kevin Elster also homered for the Rangers, who gained a split of
the four-game series. Darren Oliver (3-5) allowed three runs and
seven hits in five innings, and Tim Patterson got four outs for his
first save.
  White Sox 8, Tigers 2  
	   In Detroit, Jim Parque pitched 6 1-3 shutout innings in his
second major league start and Chicago hit three home runs for the
win.
	   Wil Cordero, Mike Caruso and Frank Thomas homered for the White
Sox, who gained a split of the four-game series with just their
fourth win in 10 games.
	   Parque (1-0), a left-hander who a year ago was pitching for UCLA
in the College World Series, allowed four hits and three walks.
	   Detroit's Damion Easley went 0-for-4, ending his AL season-best
hitting streak at 19 games.
	   Frank Castillo (2-3) took the loss.
  Indians 8, Blue Jays 3  
	   In Toronto, Cleveland scored four runs off Pat Hentgen in the
fourth inning and Charles Nagy (7-2) pitched 6 1-3 solid innings
for his fourth straight win.
	   Jim Thome and Mark Whiten hit solo homers and David Bell and
Omar Vizquel had RBI singles in the fourth off Hentgen (7-4).
	   Carlos Delgado put the Blue Jays up 2-0 in the first with a
433-foot (132-meter) home run to right center.
	   Jose Mesa pitched the final two innings for his first save.
  Angels 6, Twins 5  
	   In Minneapolis, Jason Dickson, an All-Star starter last season,
allowed two hits in 4 1-3 innings of relief before Gary DiSarcina's
sacrifice fly in the ninth lifted Anaheim.
	   Dickson (4-4), a 13-game winner in 1997, is now 2-0 with a 1.42
ERA in five relief appearances since being demoted from the
rotation on May 5. Troy Percival got his 14th save.
	   Justin Baughman tripled off Greg Swindell (0-2) leading off the
ninth and DiSarcina followed with his sacrifice fly to right field.
	   Angels starter Jack McDowell allowed 10 hits and five runs in
just 3 2-3 innings in his second start since coming off the
disabled list.
  Royals 10, Athletics 4  
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer homered and Terry
Pendleton and Mike Sweeney each had two hits in a seven-run seventh
inning for the Royals.
	   The Royals had a season-high 16 hits, including eight against
five pitchers in the seventh when they turned a 4-2 deficit into a
9-4 lead.
	   Jeff King and Johnny Damon added solo homers for Kansas City to
make a winner out of starter Tim Belcher (4-6).
	   The loss went to T.J. Mathews (3-4), who walked the only batter
he faced in the game.

Successor of scandal-scarred president tied in presidential race quote and ADDS that Serpa resigned as interior minister last year.

Eds: UPDATES with Sanin winning three largest cities, with Serpa

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Despite widespread disillusion with the
scandal-tainted administration in which he was a key player,
Horacio Serpa was headed Sunday for a runoff with a Conservative
Party challenger who painted himself the candidate of change.
	   With 97 percent or 10.6 million votes counted, Serpa of the
governing Liberal Party had 34.6 percent against 34.3 percent for
the Conservatives' Andres Pastrana, a former Bogota mayor in his
second straight run for the presidency.
	   Noemi Sanin, a former foreign minister who had hoped to break
the traditional parties' century-old monopoly on power, had 27
percent, official results showed.
	   Sanin's independent campaign had surged in recent days and she
won in Colombia's three biggest cities _ Bogota, Medellin and Cali,
splitting the protest vote amid a record voter turnout.
	   Both the Sanin and Pastrana candidacies were spurred by
rejection of the four-year presidency of Ernesto Samper, in which
Serpa was interior minister until stepping down last year to launch
his candidacy.
	   ``Today Colombians defeated indifference but, more than anything
else, we defeated business as usual,'' Pastrana told supporters.
	   But Serpa, a populist who appeals to the poor and billed himself
as the best chance for peace with leftist rebels, benefited from a
well-greased political machine that dominates Congress and has held
presidency for the past 12 years, trading patronage for voter
support.
	   ``The people are always wise,'' Serpa declared, promising that
peace would bring true change.

Finance minister: Bad stats won't change growth forecast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will not change its
projection of 2.5 percent growth for this year, despite new figures
that show the economy is in worse shape than previously thought,
the finance minister said Monday.
	   The Central Bank's announcement Saturday that Gross Domestic
Product shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter this year was
the worst sign yet of the country's economic problems, said Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   But Anwar said the news would not prompt the government to
change its forecast for this year, citing positive growth in April.
	   Malaysia's central bank, Bank Negara, is forecasting that
exports would grow, boosting the economy, even though regional
currencies have dropped dramatically in value since the onset of
the Asian financial crisis.
	   Anwar also said Malaysia would continue to allow market forces
determine interest rates. ``I have asked Bank Negara to give an
explanation on the interest rate policy today,'' he said.
	   He denied that there was a conflict between Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and the central bank on the issue of interest
rates.
	   Over the weekend Mahathir had said the government was
considering lowering interest rates, currently at about 15 percent.
The central bank, however, was committed to maintaining rates that
were comparatively high by recent standards in Malaysia.
	   Mahathir and his closest economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, have
both warned that a tough monetary policy could derail Malaysia's
recovery efforts.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's three governing coalition parties
officially broke up their alliance Monday, bringing to an end four
years of legislative cooperation ahead of parliamentary elections
this summer.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, meeting with Takako Doi, head
of the Social Democratic Party, and Masayoshi Takemura, chairman of
New Party Sakigake, accepted the two parties' departure from the
ruling bloc.
	   The breakup, however, was seen as unlikely to have much impact
on Hashimoto's administration as his ruling Liberal Democratic
Party dominates Parliament's powerful lower house and should have
little trouble gaining support from other parties when needed.
	   ``Over the past year, the coalition was mainly driven at the
LDP's pace and that left it in bad shape,'' Takemura said.
	   The one-time finance minister also said that Sakigake will
remake itself as a party focusing on environmental issues as its
most important political issue.
	   Doi's party decided Saturday to end its alliance with the LDP,
citing disagreement with Hashimoto's party on two key issues,
including political ethics and Japan-U.S. defense ties.
	   Hashimoto said in a nationally televised interview Monday that
his party will continuously respect ``a history of working
together,'' indicating that the LDP will continue to seek
cooperation from the former partners on some issues.
	   The pro-business LDP has 261 seats in the powerful 500-member
lower house. But with 118 seats in the less powerful upper house it
still needs support from the 21-member Social Democratic Party and
three-member Sakigake to gain a majority in the 252-member body.
	   Half of the upper house seats will be at stake in elections
slated for sometime in July.

Khai allocates preferential loans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has decided
to allocate 1.5 trillion dong (dlrs 120 million) in preferential
bank loans for several key industries, the Dau Tu (Investment)
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The government originally set aside 6.6 trillion dong (dlrs 510
million) in preferential bank loans for priority projects, but the
garment, textile, footwear and machinery industries were not on the
list.
	   The interest rate will be 0.81 percent per month for loans in
dong and 8.5 percent per year for loans in U.S. dollars, with a
maximum payback period of 10 years.
	   Longer-term loans must seek approval from the prime minister.
	   Khai recently told government agencies to cut back inefficient
investment projects in sugar processing, breweries and hotels and
increase funding for projects which can find markets such as
bicycles, garments, textiles and footwear.

Chinese dissidents call on public to pressure government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Their previous attempts to seek government
redress having failed, Chinese dissidents have urged citizens
nationwide to press for democratic reforms, a rights group reported
Monday.
	   In a bold open letter, the former secretary to one of China's
leading reformers and 11 other democracy campaigners appealed to
the public's growing sense of rights and lingering outrage over the
military's bloody quelling of the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations.
	   The ninth anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown falls on
Thursday and police have stepped up detentions and surveillance of
dissidents to prevent any challenges to Communist Party rule. By
one Hong Kong-based monitoring group's count, police have arrested
or detained more than 20 dissidents to prevent public
commemorations.
	   Chinese leaders have refused to provide a full accounting of the
military's armed sweep through central Beijing. The death toll,
believed to number in the hundreds if not thousands, has never been
divulged.
	   In their open letter, the 12 democracy campaigners noted that
ordinary citizens and the families of victims have repeatedly asked
the government for a reassessment of the crackdown.
	   ``These legally reasonable appeals have never obtained a
well-intentioned response. To the contrary they have been met with
ceaseless suppression and some people who have issued appeals have
been sent to labor camps,'' said a copy of the open letter dated
Sunday and released Monday by New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   Chinese leaders' unwillingness to adopt democratic and legal
reforms have allowed official corruption _ a key concern of the
1989 student-led movement _ to worsen, the letter said.
	   ``This is an evil consequence produced by the suppression of the
`89 democratic movement and the obstruction of democratization,''
the letter said.
	   The dissidents called on the people to push Chinese leaders to
re-examine the 1989 crackdown, join ``the worldwide wave of
democracy,'' protect civil liberties and adopt legal reforms.
	   The appeal was led by Lin Mu, once the secretary to Communist
Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang. Hu was ousted by party elders
in 1987 for having failed to stop an earlier wave of student-led
protests.
	   His death in April 1989 sparked student demonstrations that
eventually brought more than a million people to Tiananmen Square.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia does not accept that a
nuclear arms race is the way to solve the problems of South Asia,
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Monday.
	   Australia has called for a special session at the U.N.
Disarmament Conference in Geneva to discuss the detonation of 11
nuclear devices in India and Pakistan in the past few weeks, Downer
told Parliament.
	   The special session Tuesday will allow the international
community to express its abhorrence of nuclear testing and the
desire for India and Pakistan to join the global non-proliferation
regime, he said.
	   ``I met the Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Geoff
Allen, this morning and discussed the government's handling of the
serious security implications of Pakistan and India's actions,''
Downer said.
	   ``Australia has long accepted that South Asia presents
particular security challenges, but we resolutely do not accept
that a nuclear arms race is the way to address these challenges.
	   ``Once again Australia calls on India and Pakistan to
immediately sign and ratify the comprehensive nuclear ban treaty,''
Downer said.

Japan's automobile sales down 8 percent in May 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell in
May for the 14th straight month as the sluggish domestic economy
continued to keep consumers out of dealer showrooms.
	   Sales fell 8 percent in May from the year-earlier month to
294,211 units, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said
Monday. The sales are measures by new registrations.
	   Sales dropped 2.8 percent compared with April.
	   The sale of passenger cars was up slightly, 0.1 percent to
294,211, compared with the year before. Truck sales, however,
plunged 23.9 percent to 82,614 sold the year before. Sales of buses
were also down, falling 1.1 percent to 784.
	   While demand for Japanese cars remains robust in North America,
domestic Japanese consumption has lagged since a sales tax increase
last year. Exports to Asia have also fallen because the financial
crisis there sent local currencies into a tailspin.

Aid supplies begin to reach quake-stricken area in Afghanistan site, more quotes from head of U.N. humanitarian office

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aircraft laden with emergency aid
flew Monday to northern Afghanistan to help the victims of a
weekend earthquake that buried as many as 3,000 people, many still
struggling from a temblor that struck the region three months
before.
	   The powerful magnitude-6.9 quake wiped out entire villages,
sliced mountains and triggered landslides. While initial estimates
are putting the death toll at 3,000, aid workers and local
officials in the area believe it could rise to 5,000. There are
thousands of people still missing and thousands more homeless.
	   ``This is a mountainous region and the force of the earthquake
sent houses crashing down the hillsides toward the valleys below,''
said Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, head of the U.N. humanitarian aid
office in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``We saw a couple of villages that had been completely
flattened, but there were probably more,'' he said after visiting
the site on Sunday.
	   Cargo aircraft packed with emergency supplies in neighboring
Pakistan were expected to reach the region Monday, aid workers
said.
	   Tons of food, blankets, tents and plastic sheeting were to be
loaded onto cargo helicopters Monday in the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad and were to be sent to the mountain capital of Faisabad.
From there, the supplies will be forwarded to the areas that
suffered the greatest damage.
	   When Saturday's quake hit, many of the people affected were
living in tents, not having had the time, money or materials to
rebuild their homes that were destroyed in February's earthquake.
	   Among those killed were 140 school children in Rostaq, the site
of a Feb. 4 earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left
another 8,000 homeless.
	   Witschi-Cestari said this quake was more devastating. While the
first struck a region with about 30,000 people, the second hit a
hilly, rugged area that is home to about twice that population.
	   The area's sun-baked mud homes, already weakened by the February
temblor, crumbled like dry dust in Saturday's violent shaking. The
homes had been made more vulnerable by the relentless rain that
battered the region in recent days.
	   ``We need help desperately. Thousands of people are dead,'' a
spokesman for a northern alliance fighting Afghanistan's Taliban
government said from the stricken area, near the border with
Tajikistan.
	   Opposition soldiers already had recovered 1,650 bodies, Shamshul
Haq Arianfar said.
	   Witschi-Cestari's helicopter swooped in low over several
villages Sunday, opening a view onto horrific scenes. Hundreds of
homes were shattered and completely flattened. U.N. officials said
4,100 houses were destroyed.
	   U.N. officials flew over some of the most desolate and
hardest-hit regions Sunday, setting down briefly near the quake's
epicenter in Shari Basurkh, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Faisabad, capital of the Badakhshan province.
	   They delivered tents and plastic sheeting as well as materials
for an emergency clinic to be set up in Shari Basurkh for the many
wounded.
	   Aid organization officials in neighboring Tajikistan were told
by the Afghan ambassador that 5,000 people were killed. The Red
Cross said it was not able to confirm the figure.
	   According to the report, the dead included 3,000 killed in Shari
Basurkh, almost 1,900 in a settlement on the outskirts of Faisabad,
the 140 children in Rostaq and 124 people in Chaib, on the
Tajikistan border.
	   Arianfar, spokesman of the anti-Taliban alliance, described
images of utter devastation. Eight villages simply disintegrated,
he said in the town of Chaib.
	   The French Foreign Ministry plans to send on 35 tons of
humanitarian aid to Duchambe, Tajikistan, where it will be
transported to the disaster area by a non-governmental
organization.
	   The International Red Cross got one plane into Faisabad on
Sunday and was preparing to set up a clinic in the area.
	   The United Nations still has about dlrs 1.2 million in its
emergency fund left over from a massive response to the appeal
after February's earthquake.

India's government faces budgetary woes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's business press fretted Monday
over how the government's new budget would cope with anti-nuclear
sanctions, a widening deficit, rising inflation and a failing
rupee.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha was to present the budget to
Parliament in a speech Monday evening.
	   His government has promised to revive India's economic growth,
which faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest
rate in the last five years. To do that, experts say, Sinha will
have to spend on infrastructure and encourage investment. His
revenue options have been reduced since the United States,
Australia, Japan and other nations cut off loans and all but
humanitarian aid to punish India for conducting five nuclear tests
May 11-13.
	   ``Investors are likely to think twice before they commit their
hard-earned money here,'' The Economic Times said in an editorial
Monday.
	   The Financial Express, saying Sinha's budget was shadowed by
``nuclear clouds,'' speculated he would hike taxes and speed up the
sale to private investors of state-owned industry to raise funds _
some of which might be spent on a bigger defense allotment ``in
wake of the deteriorating security environment in the region.''
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government's first budget ``comes
at a time when the country is reeling under a prolonged low growth
phase and has to stand up to international criticism,'' said The
Business Standard.
	   The government's pre-budget economic assessment, presented to
Parliament last week, was bleak. In addition to the falling growth,
it said the deficit rose to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product,
the total value of goods and services produced by the economy,
exceeding the target of 4.5 percent.
	   A 6.35 percent inflation rate was reported Sunday, up from 5
percent during 1997-1998.
	   The full impact of the nuclear sanctions was not yet clear, but
they were already having a chilling effect.
	   The rupee slid last week when Standard and Poor's financial
rating agency revised its India rating outlook to negative from
stable. A few days later, the World Bank postponed consideration of
more than dlrs 800 million in development loans to India because of
its nuclear tests, prompting a further slide in the rupee.
	   The rupee opened Monday at 41.74 to the U.S. dollar; it was
39.73 at the beginning of May.

Deposed co-premier registers to vote in Cambodia's elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh
registered to vote Monday in upcoming elections, backing off
threats to boycott if the polls are unlikely to be free and fair.
	   But Ranariddh, deposed as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup, said that his FUNCINPEC party may push to postpone the
July 26 vote to reduce the advantage held by his archrival,
strongman Hun Sen.
	   ``We should not talk about a boycott,'' Ranariddh told reporters
after receiving his voter registration card. ``But we should talk
about the possibility of postponing the election.''
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen of stacking the electoral
process in his favor to win the polls, which he hopes will restore
international legitimacy and aid lost due to his violent takeover
11 months ago.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed after the
coup and no one has ever been arrested. The opposition accuses Hun
Sen of intimidating opposition workers and coercing voters into
pledging support for his Cambodian People's Party.
	   Ranariddh said that if fewer than 80 percent of the 5.5 million
eligible voters register _ down from 90 percent who cast ballots in
the U.N.-brokered 1993 elections _ FUNCINPEC should ask to extend
the month-long registration process, now set to end June 15.
	   The prince reiterated concern about the opposition's limited
access to Hun Sen-controlled radio and television, calling a
present plan to allocate each political party only five minutes a
day to broadcast messages ``unacceptable.''
	   ``People must be informed about each of the parties' ...
political programs and platforms,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Last month, a coalition of opposition parties, including
FUNCINPEC, said it would boycott the elections unless conditions
were put in place to ensure the polls were credible and the
election date was pushed back.
	   The threat was largely intended to lure the international
community into helping pressure Hun Sen to comply with a minimal
criteria for fair elections.
	   But foreign diplomats, who have shown decreasing sympathy for
the opposition or its demands, have brushed the threat off as a
gimmick.

Malaysia criticizes nuclear adventurism in Asia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With three nuclear powers now in
the region, Asian nations must halt moves toward nuclear
adventurism, Malaysia's deputy prime minister said Monday.
	   ``We must oppose opportunistic politicians who fan the flames of
jingoism, be it in the name of religion or state,'' Anwar Ibrahim
said in an speech at a regional meeting on confidence building and
conflict reduction.
	   Anwar's comments reflected the growing concern over Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests among Asian nations that do not have huge
armies or nuclear programs.
	   Malaysia has opposed the tests and urged India and Pakistan to
refrain from entering into a regional nuclear arms race. India
conducted five nuclear tests last month and Pakistan, its archenemy
to the West, last week replied with five tests of its own.
	   ``We must constantly remind ourselves that in any conflict it is
always the people, not the state, who pay the price,'' he was
quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   Anwar said although Asia had three nuclear powers now, the
region that is home to half of the world's population remained
mired in poverty and destitution.
	   Diplomacy in Asia must go beyond conventional confidence
building measures to finding remedies to remove suspicion and
distrust and heal the wounds of history, he said.
	   ``Confidence building has not worked precisely because we have
not probed into the roots of suspicions and distrust between
states,'' Anwar said.
	   Asia's economic crisis was in part a result of a mismatch
between the old-fashioned national systems and the global system in
an information age, he said.
	   Asian minds were still trapped in the second industrial
revolution which was the age of automobiles and airplanes, he said.
	   ``Thus, we have become T-Rex, trying to live beyond the Jurassic
Age.''

Finance Chief: Recession unlikely this year 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is unlikely to slip into a
recession this year despite a trend toward negative growth in
Southeast Asia, Singapore's finance minister told Parliament on
Monday.
	   ``The overall picture of the Singapore economy is one of
uncertainty,'' Finance Minister Richard Hu said. But he stood by an
earlier government forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in
economic growth this year.
	   Some private analysts and economists have begun predicting that
Singapore's economy would contract this year, and have projected
GDP at 1.5 percent.
	   Hu said off-budget measures to stimulate the economy would be
decided on in late June or July.
	   ``As the Singapore economy is fairly well diversified, we are
unlikely to slip into negative growth this year as our growth will
be supported by the relatively healthy performance in the U.S. and
EU economies,'' Hu said.
	   But Hu indicated that downward growth might necessitate special
economic measures ``sooner rather than later.''
	   ``We will not wait for GDP growth to go negative before we do
something,'' he said. ``If the trend is clearly going to head in
that direction we will try to do something.''
	   Hu said that by mid-June the government would have a clear
picture of second-quarter economic developments and could react
with tax cuts or rebates.
	   The finance minister also said trade figures in the second
quarter would show a 6 percent year-on-year decline.
	   Three international investment houses, J.P. Morgan, Credit
Lyonnais Securities and Santander Investment Research, have
predicted a Singapore recession, with the economy shrinking up to
0.3 percent for 1998. Economic consultants firm I.D.E.A. has
forecast zero growth.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that
Singapore is still offering up to dlrs 5 billion in financing of
Indonesian trade through Singapore, despite the abrupt change in
government in Jakarta.
	   Lee told Parliament that the money, which is supplemental to a
rescue plan put together by the International Monetary Fund,
wouldn't be released until IMF funding for the embattled country is
reinstated.
	   ``Singapore believes that the trade financing scheme can play a
significant catalytic role to unlock private funding (for
Indonesia),'' Lee said.
	   The offer was made several months ago, but there has been little
progress on implementing it.

Reports: Japan to abandon food self-sufficiency target 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government has decided not to set a food
self-sufficiency target when it revises agricultural guidelines
next year, despite fears of overdependence on imports, news reports
said Monday.
	   Japan produces only 42 percent of the food it consumes, down
from 52 percent self-sufficiency in 1985 and 79 percent in 1960.
The country is self-sufficient in rice, however, its traditional
staple.
	   The decline has sparked fears that dependence on imports could
make Japan vulnerable to food shortages if bad weather, war or
blockage of trade lines should cut off supplies.
	   But the changing Japanese diet has made it difficult for
officials to impose restrictions on agricultural imports or compel
consumers to eat domestically grown produce, the Mainichi newpaper
reported, citing Agriculture Ministry sources. Per capita rice
consumption is dropping.
	   Japan is also under pressure from trading partners to dismantle
government subsidies for agriculture, which critics say inflate
food prices and keep cheaper foreign products out.
	   The ministry is planning to revise the basic guidelines for
agricultural policy next year for the first time since 1961, and
there has been speculation that it would impose a self-sufficiency
target.
	   Shirara Shiokawa, of the Agriculture Ministry's planning
division, said the government does not have a target in place now
and has not decided whether to implement one.
	   However, he said a government forecast shows food
self-sufficiency rising over the next few years to reach between 44
percent and 46 percent by 2005.
	   In a bid to fend off overseas pressure on Japan to further open
its agricultural market, the government may set an item-by-item
target for self-sufficiency in staple foods, such as rice and
wheat, instead of an overall food target, Kyodo News quoted
government sources as saying.
	   Kyodo News reported Monday that the government also plans to
lift a ban preventing companies under stock ownership from
acquiring farmland, in a bid to make farming corporations more
competitive through stock ownership.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Tiananmen Square, where U.S. President Bill
Clinton is expected to be formally welcomed by Chinese leaders
during his visit this month, remains a symbol of the Communist
Party's steely determination to rule alone. Still, the reins on
Chinese society have loosened since the army's bloody assault on
democracy protesters on June 4, 1989. An Associated Press
correspondent looks at changes in the lives of China's people.
	   ___
  By RENEE SCHOOF  
  Associated Press Writer  
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nine years after it crushed the democracy
movement at Tiananmen Square, China's government still wields a
heavy hand to silence dissent.
	   But these days it also is allowing ordinary people more personal
freedom.
	   To see the changes, it's necessary to look beyond Tiananmen, the
heavily guarded concrete expanse in the heart of Beijing that
demonstrators were vanquished from by troops who shot their way
through the city nearly a decade ago.
	   Although the government continues to slap down any broad
challenge to its rule, it interferes less in the daily life of the
vast majority of people who avoid political opposition. Economic
growth also has brought more choices in how people live.
	   Democracy activist Xu Wenli, who was imprisoned from 1981 to
1993, mostly in solitary confinement, sees an increased
understanding of basic rights and a new willingness to speak up
about them.
	   ``Security guards at supermarkets often unreasonably accuse
shoppers of stealing and treat them rudely,'' Xu said. ``In the
past, people would be scared of anybody in a security uniform. Now
they say, `You're violating my human rights!'''
	   Police still follow Xu and occasionally detain him for
interrogation.
	   ``People around me who don't have the slightest connection to
politics say, `They're violating your rights,''' Xu said with a
chuckle. ``In the past, they didn't dare show sympathy, much less
use those words.''
	   People speak more freely these days in part because the
government is less involved in their lives now than it has been
since the Communists took power in 1949.
	   Urban workers used to depend on government offices and factories
for jobs, housing, medical care and services and even had to
request their employers' permission to marry or travel abroad.
	   In 1989, work units still distributed the prized tickets that
allowed workers to buy meat, eggs and rice at subsidized prices,
and markets in winter sold little more than cabbage and shriveled
apples. Today, grocery stores and markets brim with foreign and
Chinese foods of all kinds.
	   Today, with economic reforms eliminating many state jobs, and
most cradle-to-grave benefits, the rapidly growing private sector
is providing the work. Many decisions are being made by the market
rather than by government officials.
	   ``Now the market basically controls more than 90 percent of
people's lives, and that's a very big change. I feel that now it's
much freer,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor in the School of
International Studies at Beijing University.
	   The development of a legal system, crucial for the growth of the
economy, has enabled Chinese to hire lawyers and file lawsuits to
seek protection of their rights.
	   The most pervasive changes are the most visible. In 1989, glossy
shopping malls were virtually nonexistent; now they're everywhere,
along with boutiques like Romance Deluxe New York.
	   Restaurants used to close early, and the only nightclubs were in
hotels for foreigners. Now bars, discos, bowling alleys and cafes
are filled with Chinese customers.
	   The average per-capita income in cities increased from the
equivalent of (US dlrs) 150 in 1989 to (US dlrs) 625 in 1997.
	   ``Of course life has changed in 10 years. People have money
now,'' said a middle-aged woman out for an afternoon of shopping at
an outdoor market near the American Embassy.
	   ``Everybody has a lot more choice in what to eat,'' said the
shopper, who gave her name as Mrs. Wang. ``And look around at how
well people dress these days. Some are even starting to buy cars.''
	   Video compact disc players are common equipment in ordinary
homes, bringing access to movies from around the world.
Government-run bookstores sell books like ``Crossed Swords,'' which
calls for freer thinking that would allow for political reforms.
	   Chinese-language e-mail has become a tool for business and
dissidents alike. Xu said dissidents now have a ``Democracy Wall of
the air,'' a reference to the movement he joined in the late 1970s
centered on a wall covered with posters in Beijing.
	   Political dissent, on the other hand, hasn't seen any loosening.
While Chinese can and do ridicule their political leaders in
private settings, public dissent remains dangerous. Police detained
at least four dissidents last week and warned others not to travel
or try to commemorate the Tiananmen anniversary on Thursday.
	   Several dissidents have been sent to labor camps without trial
in recent months after writing open letters to the government.
Another recently was imprisoned for meeting with Wang Bingzhang, an
exiled dissident who visited China to try to build an opposition
but was deported.

Ad agency apologizes over using Hitler to sell potato chips 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency has apologized
for using images of Adolf Hitler to sell potato chips in television
commercials and posters targeting Thai teen-agers.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai branch of the global ad agency,
issued a statement of regret Sunday after Israeli diplomats said
they found the advertising campaign disgusting and insensitive.
	   The statement said the agency ``wishes to apologize to any
persons who may be offended by a recent television commercial for a
potato crisp that uses images of Adolf Hitler.''
	   The commercial was produced only for Thailand on behalf of a
Thai client, Food Processing Co. Ltd., for a brand of potato chip
called X.
	   It shows Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman whom
Leo Burnett said ``clearly wants to change his evil ways by casting
a voodoo spell over him as he eats the crisps.''
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   ``The commercial is targeted to Thai teen-agers and is designed
to communicate that the world would be a better place if happiness
ruled. It was never intended to offend and the agency apologizes to
anyone who finds it sensitive,'' the statement said.
	   The poster version, displayed on many of the motorized
three-wheeled taxis plying Bangkok, suggests that eating the chips
would transform Hitler into a fun-loving Charlie Chaplin character.
	   The agency said it ``acknowledges Hitler as one of history's
most despicable dictators and would never do anything to suggest
otherwise.''
	   Israeli Embassy and company officials were not immediately
available for further comment.
	   Hitler fanned fanatical nationalism in Germany and unleashed
World War II in Europe, wreaking death across the continent. Six
million Jews and millions of other civilians he viewed as subhuman
were murdered.

Court battle begins over 1956 Olympic footage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A battle over the rights to footage of
the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games started in the Federal Court on
Monday.
	   Australia's Olympic Committee (AOC) and American sports film
company The Big Fights Inc. are arguing over the footage, which
features the opening ceremony and finals of all major events.
	   United States cable television giant, ESPN, was also has been
named as a respondent in the case, with the AOC claiming The Big
Fights had on-sold the copyright to the cable network.
	   Produced by the late documentary film producer Peter Whitchurch
as head of the 1956 Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(OCOG) film unit, the footage is being held in court-ordered safe
storage until the dispute is resolved.
	   The court was told Whitchurch had been hired by OCOG to produce
three films totaling more than 10 hours.
	   It heard that between 1992 and 1996, Whitchurch's daughters
Lynette June Benson and Diane Yvonne Talbot entered into agreements
with The Big Fights, effectively selling copyright of the films for
Australian dlrs 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,200).
	   The AOC alleged that ESPN had bought the rights to the Olympic
footage from The Big Fights.
	   AOC attorney Anthony Bannon told Justice Kevin Lindgren that
Whitchurch was an employee of the OCOG and, subject to a granting
of residual rights to the films to him in 1960, ``the physical film
was the property of OCOG''.
	   ``Clearly the work was done by employees of OCOG,'' Bannon said.
``At the very least OCOG was a co-owner. We seek a declaration that
we (the AOC) own the copyright.''
	   The hearing is scheduled for five days.

Student protests against local officials erupting across Indonesia

Eds: Many Indonesians use one name

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UJUNGPANDANG, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 800 students demanding
the resignation of a provincial governor on Sulawesi island faced
off Monday with 200 members of a Muslim youth group who support
him.
	   Despite relative calm in the capital of Jakarta, demonstrations
targeting allegedly corrupt local leaders continued to erupt across
Indonesia in recent days.
	   Student protests helped force then President Suharto to step
down after 32 years of iron-fisted rule on May 21. But governors
and other local administrators appointed by Suharto are still in
place.
	   Soldiers and police quickly positioned themselves between the
opposing groups in South Sulawesi province. The demonstrators lined
up about ten paces apart and traded shouts and epithets on the
grounds of the local legislature buildings in the provincial
capital of Ujungpandang.
	   Monday was the fourth day the students had occupied the
buildings. They have vowed not to leave until Gov. Palaguna, whom
they accuse of corruption and nepotism, steps down.
	   The students carried banners calling for reform. Their
opponents, members of the youth wing of Indonesia's largest Muslim
organization, Nadhlatul Ulama, wore green camouflage t-shirts and
held posters saying ``Reform Is Already Underway.''
	   The Indonesian capital of Jakarta has remained generally quiet
since May 22 when soldiers evicted 2,000 students from Parliament
without bloodshed.
	   After helping to force Suharto's ouster, the students demanded
the resignation of new President B.J. Habibie. The president has
called for elections in 1999 and many of Indonesia's 202 million
people appear willing to grant him a grace period as long as he
follows through on political and economic reforms he has pledged.
	   However, protests against local leaders have been breaking out
like brush fires in several cities across the archipelago during
the past week.
	   Several hundred students have taken over the local legislature
in the eastern Javanese city of Surabaya demanding the local
governor resign.
	   The Jakarta Post reported Monday that nine soldiers have been
disciplined with two weeks of detention for using excessive force
in dealing with the students.
	   More than a hundred students have also entered their fifth day
occupying the local legislature in the city of Jambi in central
Sumatra, the official Antara news agency reported Monday.
	   The students, from the Sultan Thaha Saifuddin Institute for
Islamic studies, have accused local officials of allowing gambling
to flourish in the district, and say they won't leave until all
slot machines are burned down.
	   Last week, a riot broke out in the northern Sumatran city of
Tanjungbalai, when the local governor walked out of a meeting with
demonstrators who accused him of corruption and insisted he usher
in reforms.
	   At least 20 people were arrested and dozens of shops, homes and
automobiles burned in the ensuing violence.

on strike at midnight, saying Aeromexico was unwilling to negotiate
better working conditions and benefits.
	   The government, saying national security was at state,
temporarily seized Aviacion de Mexico, which runs Mexico's largest
airline, and appointed an acting general administrator for the
duration of the strike.
	   ``This action was necessary to guarantee that people have
transportation, and also because many areas of our economy depend
on air transportation and we would have huge economic losses'' if
the flights were all grounded, an official at the transportation
secretariat said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Under Mexico's constitution, the government can temporarily
seize companies considered vital to the nation's economy or
security so that they can continue to operate during emergencies.
	   Thousands of passengers were left in limbo, as the secretariat
official conceded that most of Aeromexico's 300 daily flights
wouldn't leave the ground.
	   The government planned to fly as many planes as possible with
Aeromexico's 300 non-unionized flight attendants, and said 12
airlines that have agreements with Aeromexico would reschedule some
of the passengers.
	   If the strike drags on, he said, the government will train new
flight attendants.
	   The union said Aeromexico wasn't negotiating in good faith.
	   ``The company doesn't want to continue negotiating,'' said
Lizette Clavel, press secretary for the union. ``We're treated as
third-class workers.''
	   Aeromexico accused the flight attendants of making unreasonable
demands, calling them ``out of the range of other airlines'' and
saying meeting them would cripple the airline.
	   ``This would prevent us from having the capital we need to buy
planes and to expand,'' said General Director Alfonso Pasquel
Barcenas. ``We can't put into risk our viability as a profitable
company.''
	   The difference over salaries was small: Flight attendants said
they want a 19 percent raise while Aeromexico said it was offering
18 percent. The real conflict was over benefits and working
conditions.
	   Aeromexico wants to increase each shift, which range from eight
to 14 hours, by two hours. It also wants to reduce by two hours the
time between shifts, which range from 12 to 36 hours.
	   The flight attendants want a pension plan, which they don't
currently have, better health benefits and guarantees that flight
crews will be complete. The union says many Aeromexico flights take
off with fewer than the normal number of flight attendants.

Vietnamese journalist awarded for devotion to free press 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Vietnamese journalist Doan Viet Hoat,
currently in prison for publishing pro-democracy newsletters, was
awarded Monday the 1998 Golden Pen of Freedom for his commitment to
a free press.
	   The award, given by the World Association of Newspapers at its
51st annual meeting, held in this western Japan city, was accepted
by Hoat's wife, Tran Thi Thuc.
	   Hoat, currently serving a 15-year jail term for his writings
published in the pro-democracy newsletter Dien Dan Tu Do, or
Freedom Forum, has spent much of the past three decades in
re-education camps and prisons for calling for greater civil rights
and democratic reform in Vietnam.
	   He continues to call for the changes from his prison cell.
	   ``All that Doan Viet Hoat did was to write several articles
calling for freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom to
think for oneself, and freedom to exercise one's basic human
rights,'' Thuc said.
	   Hoat was first arrested in 1976 when he was a professor of
English literature. He was accused of being a ``Lackey of American
imperialism'' for calling for greater civil liberties in postwar
Vietnam. He spent 12 years in re-education camps, without trial.
	   Hoat then created a small underground magazine. He was arrested
again in 1990, imprisoned for 28 months without charge, then
sentenced to a 20-year term for publishing ``anti-communist''
articles. The prison term was later reduced to 15 years.
	   Also Monday, the first day of the associations's three-day
congress, participants agreed that industrialized nations and
international aid agencies should provide greater support to
independent newspapers in developing countries, where a free press
is crucial for sustainable development.
	   ``There simply is no real and durable development without
transparency and a free flow of information,'' association
president Jayme Sirotsky said.
	   The World Association of Newspapers represents 15,000 newspapers
around the world. The meeting was being co-sponsored by the Japan
Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association.

India's government faces budgetary woes 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to restore eds note
Eds: Budget speech begins at 1130 GMT.
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's business press fretted Monday
over how the government's new budget would cope with anti-nuclear
sanctions, a widening deficit, rising inflation and a failing
rupee.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha was to present the budget to
Parliament in a speech Monday evening.
	   His government has promised to revive India's economic growth,
which faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest
rate in the last five years. To do that, experts say, Sinha will
have to spend on infrastructure and encourage investment. His
revenue options have been reduced since the United States,
Australia, Japan and other nations cut off loans and all but
humanitarian aid to punish India for conducting five nuclear tests
May 11-13.
	   ``Investors are likely to think twice before they commit their
hard-earned money here,'' The Economic Times said in an editorial
Monday.
	   The Financial Express, saying Sinha's budget was shadowed by
``nuclear clouds,'' speculated he would hike taxes and speed up the
sale to private investors of state-owned industry to raise funds _
some of which might be spent on a bigger defense allotment ``in
wake of the deteriorating security environment in the region.''
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government's first budget ``comes
at a time when the country is reeling under a prolonged low growth
phase and has to stand up to international criticism,'' said The
Business Standard.
	   The government's pre-budget economic assessment, presented to
Parliament last week, was bleak. In addition to the falling growth,
it said the deficit rose to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product,
the total value of goods and services produced by the economy,
exceeding the target of 4.5 percent.
	   A 6.35 percent inflation rate was reported Sunday, up from 5
percent during 1997-1998.
	   The full impact of the nuclear sanctions was not yet clear, but
they were already having a chilling effect.
	   The rupee slid last week when Standard and Poor's financial
rating agency revised its India rating outlook to negative from
stable. A few days later, the World Bank postponed consideration of
more than dlrs 800 million in development loans to India because of
its nuclear tests, prompting a further slide in the rupee.
	   The rupee opened Monday at 41.74 to the U.S. dollar; it was
39.73 at the beginning of May.

Finance minister: Bad stats won't change growth forecast 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with new quotes and details. No pick up
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will not change its
projection of 2.5 percent growth for this year, despite new figures
that show the economy is in worse shape than previously thought,
the finance minister said Monday.
	   The Central Bank's announcement Saturday that Gross Domestic
Product shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter this year was
the worst sign yet of the country's economic problems, said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But Anwar, who is also Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said
the news would not prompt the government to change its forecast for
this year, citing positive growth in April.
	   Economists regard two successive quarters of negative growth as
the criteria for a recession.
	   ``The worst is over for the country's economy,'' he said. The
figures for January to March 1998 ``shouldn't be taken out of
context.''
	   Malaysia's central bank, Bank Negara, is forecasting that
exports would grow, boosting the economy, even though regional
currencies have dropped dramatically in value since the onset of
the Asian financial crisis.
	   Anwar also said Malaysia would continue to allow market forces
to determine interest rates. ``I have asked Bank Negara to give an
explanation on the interest rate policy today,'' he said.
	   He denied that there was a conflict between Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and the central bank on the issue of interest
rates.
	   Over the weekend Mahathir had said the government was
considering lowering interest rates, currently at about 15 percent.
The central bank, however, was committed to maintaining rates that
were comparatively high by recent standards in Malaysia.
	   Mahathir and his closest economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, have
both warned that a tough monetary policy could derail Malaysia's
recovery efforts.
	   Anwar said that more lending needed to be directed to critical
sectors in an effort to turn the country's ailing economy around,
but this wouldn't involve bailing out politically well-connected
companies.
	   ``We should maintain our stand and not direct commercial banks
to disburse loans to selected companies,'' Anwar said.

TV, telephone, computer developments in Asia discussed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ While the latest telephone, computer and
broadcast gadgets and systems went on display Monday at a huge
exhibition, Asian telecommunications ministers talked about
regulation and privatization of the new technologies.
	   ``Governments are very concerned about what it means to be
giving away to the private sector ownership and management of
broadcasting,'' said Derek Nicholas, a consultant for the
CommunicASia/NetworkAsia conference. ``This may well act as a
retarding effect on using all this super technology we've seen.''
	   Nicholas spoke at the opening press conference of the conference
and exhibition which covers 22,490 square meters over two sites and
is Singapore's second largest trade fair.
	   Displays at the booths for NetworkAsia, CommunicAsia,
BroadcastAsia, CableSat98 and MobileCommAsia show how the different
communications sectors are increasingly interrelated. The
exhibition, in its 12th year, is attended by 1,800 companies from
46 countries.
	   For the first time at a international trade fair, the three
different high definition television systems, developed separately
by the United States, Japan and Europe, are on display at the same
show, said Stephen Tan, managing director of Singapore Exhibition
Services.
	   ``Many countries, including Singapore, are in the process of
deciding which (of the HDTV systems) to adopt,'' Tan said. Japan
and Australia have said they will put HDTV into operation for
national broadcasting by 2000-2001.
	   In conjunction with the trade fair, 11 ministers from countries
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group are gathering to
discuss liberalizing the telecommunications business across borders
and oceans. On the agenda for the Pacific Rim is a decision to
simplify certification of communications equipment to allow foreign
manufacturers greater access in the region, Japanese officials said
ahead of the meeting.
	   Currently, communications equipment such as cellular phones,
modems, and fax machines must meet technological standards and be
certified in each of the countries in which they will be used, said
an official in charge of electronics equipment at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry in Tokyo.
	   If approved, the new system would allow manufacturers to have
their equipment certified by agencies in their own countries, which
would lower costs and boost efficiency.
	   The United States and the European Union already have a similar
agreement.

Australia clinches first wheat sale to Egypt mill project 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Wheat Board on Monday
announced the first sale of wheat to a joint venture flour mill in
Egypt the board is working with.
	   The 55,000 metric ton shipment _ the first of a series planned
for the Five Star Flour Mill in Cairo _ will be loaded at the West
Australian ports of Geraldton and Kwinana early this month,
Australian Wheat Board chairman and mill director Trevor Flugge
said.
	   The Australian Wheat Board has a 30 percent stake in the
project.
	   Flugge said the sale was significant as it marked the beginning
of new opportunities for Australian wheat growers in the
international trade's biggest wheat market.
	   ``With an import requirement of 6.5 million (metric) tons, a
growing population and a rapidly changing and developing milling
industry, Egypt is an important part of AWB Ltd.'s export focus,''
he said.
	   ``For Western Australian grain producers, who export over 95
percent of their grain through the company, this represents a
secure market for an estimated 120,000 tons of premium quality
wheat each year.''

Protege of scandal-plagued president heads for runoff with rival 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A protege of President Ernesto Samper
narrowly won the first round in Colombian's presidential race, but
his ties to the scandal-plagued leader could lead to defeat in the
runoff.
	   With 98 percent of the vote counted in Sunday's presidential
race, Horacio Serpa of the governing Liberal Party had 34.6 percent
to 34.3 percent for Andres Pastrana, a former Bogota mayor.
	   Both Serpa and his Conservative Party rival will compete in the
June 21 runoff for millions of votes cast for an independent
candidate who sought to break the traditional parties' century-old
monopoly on power.
	   Independent Noemi Sanin, a former foreign minister, won 27
percent of the vote. Sanin's campaign took off in recent days, and
she won by large margins Sunday in Colombia's three biggest cities:
Bogota, Medellin and Cali.
	   During victory speeches, both winning candidates tried to court
her supporters.
	   ``Nobody ever fails when they follow their ideals,'' Serpa said
of Sanin's failure to make the runoff.
	   Serpa, interior minister until last year, appears to have
benefited from a well-greased political machine. He also sought to
distance himself from Samper, who many blame for Colombia's
tarnished international image and economic malaise.
	   ``They tried to paint him (Serpa) as an accomplice to drug
trafficking,'' said Rosa Sierra, one of thousands of Serpa
supporters who celebrated at a Bogota hotel Sunday night.
	   Ties with the United States were badly strained over the
acceptance by Samper's 1994 campaign of dlrs 6 million from the
Cali drug cartel. Washington stripped Samper of his visa and U.S.
officials have privately called Serpa a criminal for allegedly
covering up the scandal
	   Nevertheless, Serpa will seek ``harmonious relations with the
United States'' if he becomes president, campaign adviser Carlos
Ossa told The Associated Press.
	   ``They (the United States) think that Serpa is an extension of
Samper, but he is not,'' the adviser said.
	   Whoever wins will inherit a country in political and economic
crisis.
	   Leftist rebels have filled a power vacuum left by a weakened
government, dominating huge swaths of territory. Inflation and
unemployment have risen sharply. The flow of illicit drugs out of
Colombia has remained steady.
	   Pastrana narrowly lost to Samper in 1994.
	   In this year's unpredictable race, Colombians voted in record
numbers. Turnout was roughly double the votes cast in the first
round of the 1994 elections.
	   At least 11 people were killed Sunday in a sabotage campaign by
guerrillas. At least 21 election officials were abducted over the
weekend.
	   Attacks and ballot-burning by rebels forced the cancellation of
voting in at least 63 towns and villages.

Dollar rises, stocks plunge in Tokyo trading prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices finished sharply lower Monday
amid renewed worries about the health of Japan's economy. The U.S.
dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 349.75 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 15,321.03 points. On Friday, the index
had lost 125.77 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   Traders said selling of blue chips by overseas investors pushed
the Nikkei average sharply lower. Domestic institutional investors
later joined in the selling.
	   Hurting sentiment were recent signs that Japan's economic woes
have deepened. On Friday, the government said Japan's unemployment
rate hit a record 4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in March.
	   On Monday, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said sales
of new cars, trucks and buses fell in May from a year earlier for
the 14th consecutive month as the sluggish domestic economy
continued to keep consumers from dealer showrooms.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent, to 1,196.70.
The TOPIX fell 2.24 points, or 0.18 percent on Friday.
	   In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 139.14 yen, up 0.42
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 138.90 yen Friday.
	   The slide on the Tokyo Stock Exchange pushed the dollar through
the 139.00 yen level, traders said.
	   ``The weak stock and bond market is making it that much easier
to buy the dollar and break through resistance,'' said Eji Takane,
deputy general manager of foreign exchange at Asahi Bank.
	   Japanese investors and interbank players bought the U.S.
currency against the yen, lifting the dollar's value.
	   Uncertainty in South Asia following Pakistan's sixth nuclear
test Saturday along with the weakness in the Japanese economy
continued to draw investors to the dollar.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to a record of 1.165 percent from Friday's
finish of 1.205 percent, driving its price higher to 112.33 yen
from 112.04 yen.
	   The yield on the benchmark bond touched a record low of 1.190
percent on Friday.

Nelson Easy Winner in Pittsburgh Senior Classic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELL ACRES, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Even after consecutive
record-tying rounds of 65, Larry Nelson was worried.
	   ``It was a little more difficult than I thought it would be,''
Nelson said after a 2-over-par 74 on Sunday, giving him a
five-stroke victory in the Pittsburgh Senior Classic with a 204
total.
	   ``It was kind of an uneventful day,'' Nelson said. ``I just
wanted to not embarrass myself.''
	   It helped that Nelson blistered the tournament with consecutive
65s over the Sewickley Heights Golf Club.
	   Following an opening-hole bogey on Friday, Nelson played 40
straight bogey-free holes, finally running into trouble Sunday at
the par-4, No. 6 as the wind gusted to 35 mph (56 kph) and his
red-hot putter began to cool. His second shot landed on the green
about 25 feet (7.5 meters) from the hole, but Nelson three-putted.
	   Nelson also bogeyed back-to-back holes on the back nine, but
followed those with a 15-foot (4.6-meter) birdie putt at the par-5
No. 15. He played even-par the rest of the way, never letting
runnerup Bob Duval get closer than the final five-stroke margin of
victory.
	   ``It was a pretty good tournament, except for one person,'' said
Duval, who was followed by Jay Sigel at 72-210 and Al Geiberger,
who was another stroke back after a 72. Seven other players were
tied at 212, including Gary Player and Ray Floyd.
	   The tournament was never close, thanks to Nelson's blazing start
on Friday and Saturday, twice tying the course record that stood
unmatched since 1977. When Nelson finished the front nine on
Sunday, he still led by eight strokes.
	   ``He could have stumbled into the clubhouse and he still would
have won,'' said Duval, who finished second in the Pittsburgh
Senior Classic for the second straight year. Last year, Duval lost
to Hugh Baiocchi in a playoff.
	   Nelson, who joined the Senior Tour last September, won for the
second time, matching the wire-to-wire victory he posted at the
American Express Invitational in Sarasota, Florida, in February. He
has now finished in the top 10 in 10 of the 16 Senior Tour events
he has played. The first-place check for dlrs 165,000 was the
second-largest Nelson has collected in his career, and it pushed
him over the dlrs 1 million mark for Senior Tour earnings.
	   Nelson also scored his second professional win at a Pittsburgh
area course. One of Nelson's most memorable days as a golfer came
nearby, at Oakmont Country Club, where his 62-foot (19-meter)
birdie putt at the 16th hole sealed his dramatic 1-stroke win over
Tom Watson in the 1983 U.S. Open.

Gascoigne's erratic play on and off pitch costs him World Cup spot GMT 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: WILL be updated after Hoddle news conference beginning at 1130
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne's socializing, erratic play on and
off the soccer field, and lack of fitness finally caught up with
him.
	   In one of the biggest World Cup-related stories in the country
since 1966 _ when England won its lone World Cup _ the 31-year-old
Gascoigne was left of this year's World Cup team named Sunday by
coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   As well as Gascoigne, Hoddle also dropped five other players _
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, Manchester United's Phil Neville
and Nicky Butt, Coventry's Dion Dublin and Everton's Andy
Hinchcliffe _ to get down to the final 22-man team.
	   Gascoigne, a key figure when England reached the World Cup
semifinals in 1990 in Italy, returned to England after the shock
announcement at the La Manga resort in southeastern Spain where the
team is training prior to the World Cup, which opens June 10 in
Paris.
	   ``I can't believe this has happened. This is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me,'' The Sun newspaper quoted Gascoigne
as saying.
	   The Sun said Gascoigne _ rated as one of the country's best-ever
at midfield _ broke down in tears when Hoddle told him Sunday that
he was not going to France and that, after a flare up with Hoddle,
Gascoigne fled the team's training camp, leaving his luggage
behind.
	   Hoddle made his announcement a day early when a tabloid
newspaper got wind of Gascoigne's absence. Hoddle, who is reported
to have warned Gascoigne about his lack of fitness and slack
training habits, was scheduled to hold a press conference in Spain
at 1130 GMT Monday to explain his decision.
	   The unexpected gamble by Hoddle, the No. 1 news item Monday
across England, was surprisingly supported by more than 75 percent
of callers to a popular London morning radio show.
	   The story dwarfed news that Geri Halliwell was leaving the
English all-girls pop group the Spice Girls.
	   Gascoigne, who has played for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio,
Glasgow Rangers and Middlesbrough, seems to have lost the ability
to win games with his magical passing and dribbling. He has also
suffered numerous injuries and attracted the wrong kind of
publicity off the field.
	   Ankle and groin injuries sidelined him for much of last season
and, although he played 90 minutes of England's 0-0 tie with Saudi
Arabia and the 1-0 victory over Morocco on Wednesday, he managed
only half of the game against Belgium and limped off with a leg
injury.
	   In those three matches he looked ineffective, a shadow of the
creative player that made him a one-of-a-kind on previous English
sides.
	   Some of the tabloids newspaper have been gunning for Gascoigne,
accusing him of late night drinking with his showbiz friends and
castigating him for smoking 20 cigarettes a day.
	   Although Gascoigne was reported ruled out for his lack of
fitness, Hoddle kept the faith with Les Ferdinand and Darren
Anderton, two Tottenham players who have been short on fitness and
form this season.
	   The move leaves England without a player with World Cup
experience. The club failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and reached the semifinals in 1990 in Italy.
	   Gascoigne's manager at Middlesbrough, Bryan Robson, said he was
stunned.
	   ``I'm surprised,'' admitted Robson. ``When Gazza's fit, he's the
one who can do it at the highest level. He was all right when he
was with us at Middlesbrough. He helped us win important games and
could do that for England.''
	   The squad:
	   Goalkeepers _ David Seaman (Arsenal), Tim Flowers (Blackburn),
Nigel Martyn (Leeds),
	   Defenders _ Sol Campbell (Tottenham), Tony Adams (Arsenal),
Martin Keown (Arsenal), Rio Ferdinand (West Ham), Gareth Southgate
(Aston Villa), Gary Neville (Manchester United),
	   Midfielders _ Darren Anderton (Tottenham), David Beckham
(Manchester United), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Robert Lee
(Newcastle), Steve McManaman (Liverpool), Paul Ince (Liverpool),
David Batty (Newcastle), Paul Merson (Middlesbrough), Paul Scholes
(Manchester United),
	   Strikers _ Les Ferdinand (Tottenham), Alan Shearer (Newcastle),
Teddy Sheringham (Manchester United), Michael Owen (Liverpool).

India denies it has plans another nuclear test With Pakistan-India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday denied Pakistani
allegations it had plans to continue the nuclear test tit-for-tat
that has raised tensions in this already volatile region.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was
surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was
``surprising.''
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   India was the first to escalate the long-standing Indo-Pakistan
rivalry to the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In
response, Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices
last week.
	   ``I have credible information that they (the Indians) are
already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast
somewhere in the first or second week in July,'' Khan told CNN
Sunday.
	   Pakistan has not said whether it would test again. U.S.
intelligence sources said over the weekend they had detected no
signs that either Pakistan or India was readying new tests.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed in its
entirety by both countries.
	   The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to
sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Dallas Stars gambled and lost. Now the
Detroit Red Wings are just one win away from a repeat trip to the
Stanley Cup Finals.
	   Vyacheslav Kozlov broke a tie at 11:30 of the third period to
lift the Red Wings to a 3-2 victory over Dallas on Sunday in Game 4
of the Western Conference finals.
	   Kirk Maltby and Steve Yzerman also scored for the Red Wings, who
took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series. Pat Verbeek and Sergei
Zubov scored for the Stars.
	   ``We're scoring important goals at the right time,'' Detroit
forward Darren McCarty said. ``We're hoping that continues. Now
we've got to win one more hockey game in Dallas.''
	   The Stars, who are 1-16-2 at Joe Louis Arena since the franchise
moved from Minneapolis, will host Game 5 on Wednesday night in
Dallas. If a sixth game is necessary, it will be played Friday
night in Detroit.
	   Fourteen teams have come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a
best-of-7 series, most recently the Edmonton Oilers over the
Colorado Avalanche in the first round of this year's playoffs.
	   ``I think we all realize our situation,'' Dallas forward Mike
Modano said. ``We're not yet in those record books. We have
something to strive for and play for. We have two days to regroup
and rally around what we have to do for Wednesday.''
	   The Stars battled back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the game on
Zubov's power-play goal 55 seconds into the third period.
	   But Yzerman set up the winning goal, grabbing a loose puck and
weaving his way across two lines. Yzerman turned at the top of the
left circle and fed the puck to Larry Murphy.
	   Dallas goalie Ed Belfour had almost no chance as Kozlov, camped
at the left side of the net, deflected Murphy's shot from the top
of the slot over the goaltender's right shoulder at 11:30 of the
third period.
	   ``Even at 2-0 down, we thought we could still win the game, and
at 2-2, we thought we would,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``But they got a great goal from three skill players.
	   ``We gambled, going for a 2-on-0 at the net, but instead, they
got a 4-on-2 going the other way.''
	   The rest was up to Detroit goalie Chris Osgood. The Stars, who
outshot Detroit 30-23, peppered Osgood the rest of the way but
couldn't put the puck in the net.
	   Dallas pulled Belfour for an extra attacker with 1:18 remaining
and put tremendous pressure on Osgood. A hard shot by Zubov, which
Osgood caught in his glove, almost flipped over the Detroit
goaltender.
	   ``He came up big at the end on Zubov's shot,'' Verbeek said. ``I
don't know how he saw it, because it was by my chin and I didn't
see it, either.''
	   Osgood admitted the final minute was tense.
	   ``They were shooting the puck every chance they got,'' said
Osgood. ``I had about three guys in front of me. They were really
coming after us at the end. They were pretty desperate.''
	   The Stars went into the game 0-for-17 on the power play during
the series and their woes continued in the early periods. Maltby
scored the game's first goal at 7:02 of the first period while the
Red Wings were shorthanded.
	   Yzerman gave Detroit a 2-0 lead at 12:10 of the first while Jere
Lehtinen was serving a tripping penalty for Belfour.
	   Verbeek made it 2-1 with an unassisted goal at 14:31 of the
second, coming from behind the net and jamming the puck between
Osgood and the post.

	   ``We're scoring important goals at the right time,'' Detroit
forward Darren McCarty said. ``We're hoping that continues. Now
we've got to win one more hockey game in Dallas.''
	   The Stars, who are 1-16-2 at Joe Louis Arena since the franchise
moved from Minneapolis, will host Game 5 on Wednesday night in
Dallas. If a sixth game is necessary, it will be played Friday
night in Detroit.
	   Fourteen teams have come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a
best-of-7 series, most recently the Edmonton Oilers over the
Colorado Avalanche in the first round of this year's playoffs.
	   ``I think we all realize our situation,'' Dallas forward Mike
Modano said. ``We're not yet in those record books. We have
something to strive for and play for. We have two days to regroup
and rally around what we have to do for Wednesday.''
	   The Stars battled back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the game on
Zubov's power-play goal 55 seconds into the third period.
	   But Yzerman set up the winning goal, grabbing a loose puck and
weaving his way across two lines. Yzerman turned at the top of the
left circle and fed the puck to Larry Murphy.
	   Dallas goalie Ed Belfour had almost no chance as Kozlov, camped
at the left side of the net, deflected Murphy's shot from the top
of the slot over the goaltender's right shoulder at 11:30 of the
third period.
	   ``Even at 2-0 down, we thought we could still win the game, and
at 2-2, we thought we would,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``But they got a great goal from three skill players.
	   ``We gambled, going for a 2-on-0 at the net, but instead, they
got a 4-on-2 going the other way.''
	   The rest was up to Detroit goalie Chris Osgood. The Stars, who
outshot Detroit 30-23, peppered Osgood the rest of the way but
couldn't put the puck in the net.
	   Dallas pulled Belfour for an extra attacker with 1:18 remaining
and put tremendous pressure on Osgood. A hard shot by Zubov, which
Osgood caught in his glove, almost flipped over the Detroit
goaltender.
	   ``He came up big at the end on Zubov's shot,'' Verbeek said. ``I
don't know how he saw it, because it was by my chin and I didn't
see it, either.''
	   Osgood admitted the final minute was tense.
	   ``They were shooting the puck every chance they got,'' said
Osgood. ``I had about three guys in front of me. They were really
coming after us at the end. They were pretty desperate.''
	   The Stars went into the game 0-for-17 on the power play during
the series and their woes continued in the early periods. Maltby
scored the game's first goal at 7:02 of the first period while the
Red Wings were shorthanded.
	   Yzerman gave Detroit a 2-0 lead at 12:10 of the first while Jere
Lehtinen was serving a tripping penalty for Belfour.
	   Verbeek made it 2-1 with an unassisted goal at 14:31 of the
second, coming from behind the net and jamming the puck between
Osgood and the post.

Finance Chief: Recession unlikely this year drop, further quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with union chief predicting record layoffs, market
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is unlikely to slip into a
recession this year despite a trend toward negative growth in
Southeast Asia, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament on
Monday, but the market was unconvinced.
	   Meanwhile, the government minister who heads the national trade
unions said layoffs this year would exceed the 20,000 who lost
their jobs during the 1985-86 recessions.
	   ``The overall picture of the Singapore economy is one of
uncertainty,'' Hu told Parliament. But he stood by an earlier
government forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in economic
growth this year.
	   Some private analysts and economists have begun predicting
Singapore's economy would contract this year with a GDP of no more
than 1.5 percent. Three major international investment houses have
predicted recession.
	   Singapore's already bearish market fell on recession jitters,
with property stocks fueling the sell-off after the government said
it would do nothing drastic to stimulate construction or cushion
the tax and interest bite for those with undeveloped land and
untenanted units.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index fell 1.3 percent
by midday.
	   ``Because we do a lot of trade with our neighbors, demand drops,
and I think if the second half of this year is worse, some
companies will have to trim costs by cutting down the work force,''
said Lim Boon Heng, who is secretary-general of the National Trade
Unions Congress and also a minister without portfolio in the
government. He said the number of layoffs could exceed the 20,000
record.
	   Finance Minister Hu said off-budget measures to stimulate the
economy would be decided on in late June or July.
	   ``As the Singapore economy is fairly well diversified, we are
unlikely to slip into negative growth this year as our growth will
be supported by the relatively healthy performance in the U.S. and
(European Union) economies,'' Hu said.
	   But Hu indicated that downward growth might necessitate special
economic measures ``sooner rather than later.''
	   ``We will not wait for GDP growth to go negative before we do
something,'' he said. ``If the trend is clearly going to head in
that direction we will try to do something.''
	   Hu said that by mid-June the government would have a clear
picture of second-quarter economic developments and could react
with tax cuts or rebates.
	   The finance minister also said trade figures in the second
quarter would show a 6 percent year-on-year decline.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that
Singapore is still offering up to dlrs 5 billion in financing of
Indonesian trade through Singapore, despite the abrupt change in
government in Jakarta.
	   Lee told Parliament that the money, which is supplemental to a
rescue plan put together by the International Monetary Fund,
wouldn't be released until IMF funding is reinstated.

Gascoigne's erratic play on and off pitch costs him World Cup spot conference beginning at 1130 GMT 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Steven quote; WILL be updated after Hoddle news
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne's socializing, erratic play on and
off the soccer field, and lack of fitness finally caught up with
him.
	   In one of the biggest World Cup-related stories in the country
since 1966 _ when England won its lone World Cup _ the 31-year-old
Gascoigne was left of this year's World Cup team named Sunday by
coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   As well as Gascoigne, Hoddle also dropped five other players _
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, Manchester United's Phil Neville
and Nicky Butt, Coventry's Dion Dublin and Everton's Andy
Hinchcliffe _ to get down to the final 22-man team.
	   Gascoigne, a key figure when England reached the World Cup
semifinals in 1990 in Italy, returned to England after the shock
announcement at the La Manga resort in southeastern Spain where the
team is training prior to the World Cup, which opens June 10 in
Paris.
	   ``I can't believe this has happened. This is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me,'' The Sun newspaper quoted Gascoigne
as saying.
	   The Sun said Gascoigne _ rated as one of the country's best-ever
at midfield _ broke down in tears when Hoddle told him Sunday that
he was not going to France and that, after a flare up with Hoddle,
Gascoigne fled the team's training camp, leaving his luggage
behind.
	   Hoddle made his announcement a day early when a tabloid
newspaper got wind of Gascoigne's absence. Hoddle, who is reported
to have warned Gascoigne about his lack of fitness and slack
training habits, was scheduled to hold a press conference in Spain
at 1130 GMT Monday to explain his decision.
	   The unexpected gamble by Hoddle, the No. 1 news item Monday
across England, was surprisingly supported by more than 75 percent
of callers to a popular London morning radio show.
	   The story dwarfed news that Geri Halliwell was leaving the
English all-girls pop group the Spice Girls.
	   Gascoigne, who has played for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio,
Glasgow Rangers and Middlesbrough, seems to have lost the ability
to win games with his magical passing and dribbling. He has also
suffered numerous injuries and attracted the wrong kind of
publicity off the field.
	   Ankle and groin injuries sidelined him for much of last season
and, although he played 90 minutes of England's 0-0 tie with Saudi
Arabia and the 1-0 victory over Morocco on Wednesday, he managed
only half of the game against Belgium and limped off with a leg
injury.
	   In those three matches he looked ineffective, a shadow of the
creative player that made him a one-of-a-kind on previous English
sides.
	   Some of the tabloids newspaper have been gunning for Gascoigne,
accusing him of late night drinking with his showbiz friends and
castigating him for smoking 20 cigarettes a day.
	   Although Gascoigne was reported ruled out for his lack of
fitness, Hoddle kept the faith with Les Ferdinand and Darren
Anderton, two Tottenham players who have been short on fitness and
form this season.
	   The move leaves England without a player with World Cup
experience. The club failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and reached the semifinals in 1990 in Italy.
	   Trevor Steven, a former England teammate, criticized Hoddle's
decision.
	   ``There's still two and a half weeks before kick off. Paul has
something that nobody else can offer the team and I would have just
given him that time.
	   ``As an England fan I would have loved to have seen him do well.
But the decision has been made and I think our squad is poorer for
the lack of Paul Gascoigne.''
	   Gascoigne's manager at Middlesbrough, Bryan Robson, was also
critical.
	   ``I'm surprised,'' admitted Robson. ``When Gazza's fit, he's the
one who can do it at the highest level. He was all right when he
was with us at Middlesbrough. He helped us win important games and
could do that for England.''
	   The squad:
	   Goalkeepers _ David Seaman (Arsenal), Tim Flowers (Blackburn),
Nigel Martyn (Leeds),
	   Defenders _ Sol Campbell (Tottenham), Tony Adams (Arsenal),
Martin Keown (Arsenal), Rio Ferdinand (West Ham), Gareth Southgate
(Aston Villa), Gary Neville (Manchester United),
	   Midfielders _ Darren Anderton (Tottenham), David Beckham
(Manchester United), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Robert Lee
(Newcastle), Steve McManaman (Liverpool), Paul Ince (Liverpool),
David Batty (Newcastle), Paul Merson (Middlesbrough), Paul Scholes
(Manchester United),
	   Strikers _ Les Ferdinand (Tottenham), Alan Shearer (Newcastle),
Teddy Sheringham (Manchester United), Michael Owen (Liverpool).

Facing uncertain future, Indonesians return to nationalist roots 
</HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
By Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ As Indonesians ponder how to
reconstruct their political system, many staged low-key ceremonies
Monday to celebrate the birth of the national philosophy on which
it was founded.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has promised to hold elections
sometime in 1999 and says that free political parties will be
allowed to form as long as they follow the philosophy, Pancasila.
	   The five-point creed mandates a belief in God and respect for
the tenets of humanity, national unity, democracy and social
justice.
	   Dozens of new political parties, representing a wide range of
competing interests, are expected to be formed in the lead up to
the elections.
	   Under the old system controlled by Suharto, only three loyalist
parties were allowed to operate and their activities were strictly
scrutinized by the government.
	   Pancasila was drafted by Sukarno, the founding president of
Indonesia at independence in 1945.
	   But critics say the former regime of President Suharto, who
resigned on May 21, misused it to suppress democracy.
	   ``Pancasila is Indonesia's basic philosophy,'' said Megawati
Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's daughter and a prominent opposition leader.
``But it has been manipulated for a long time.''
	   Meanwhile a leading opposition figure has called on ex-President
Suharto to donate the bulk of his wealth, estimated in the billions
of dollars, back to the country.
	   Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader, said that with the money
Indonesia would not have to beg for assistance from international
agencies to prop up the economy, which is in its worst crisis in 30
years.
	   Rais said that if Suharto did that ``the Indonesian people could
find it in their hearts to pardon him.''
	   Rais and other critics blame nepotism, corruption and cronyism
for much of Indonesia's economic woes. He has also called for a
travel ban on the ex-president and his family amid growing calls
for an inquiry into their wealth.
	   In another development more than 800 students demanding the
resignation of a provincial governor on Sulawesi island faced off
Monday with 200 members of a Muslim youth group who support him.
	   Despite relative calm in the capital of Jakarta, demonstrations
targeting allegedly corrupt local leaders continued to erupt across
Indonesia in recent days.
	   Soldiers and police quickly positioned themselves between the
opposing groups in South Sulawesi province. The demonstrators lined
up about ten paces apart and traded shouts and epithets on the
grounds of the local legislature buildings in the provincial
capital of Ujungpandang.
	   Monday was the fourth day the students had occupied the
buildings. They have vowed not to leave until Gov. Palaguna, whom
they accuse of corruption and nepotism, steps down.

Mayor, business magnate headed for runoff in Ecuador presidential race

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The Harvard-trained mayor of Quito and
Ecuador's wealthiest man will square off in a runoff to determine
the new president of the Andean nation, which is racked by
instability.
	   Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad collected 35.4 percent of the votes
Sunday while business magnate Alvaro Noboa, who boasts of owning
105 companies ranging from banana plantations to banks, won 26.8
percent, according to an exit poll sponsored by seven television
stations.
	   They led a field of six candidates competing to replace interim
President Fabian Alarcon. But since neither received a majority of
votes, they will meet in a second round runoff on July 12.
	   Congress appointed Alarcon president in February 1997 after
deposing President Abdala Bucaram for ``mental incapacity.''
Bucaram fled to exile in Panama and is being tried in absentia on
corruption charges, but has vowed to return to politics in Ecuador.
	   Despite his absence the fiery-tongued populist, who is known as
``El Loco,'' overshadowed the voting. Many Ecuadoreans fear he is
behind Noboa's candidacy and will return if Noboa wins.
	   ``Bucaram's phantom is hovering over the campaign,'' the Quito
newspaper Hoy said last week.
	   Ecuadoreans, fed up with corrupt and ineffective governments,
were hoping the elections would produce a leader who can end the
country's political and economic instability.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, predicted that in the second round he would
receive the support of ``people who are against corruption, who are
against what Bucaram and Noboa represent.''
	   ``We have defeated the biggest fortune in Ecuador,'' he said.
``We have won despite slanderous attacks.''
	   Responding to Noboa's denunciation last week that his campaign
was financed by drug traffickers, Mahuad said: ``Noboa has taken
off his mask. He has sold his soul to Bucaram.''
	   Mahuad, a 48-year-old centrist, is boosted by his reputation as
an effective, honest mayor. He has pledged to improve health
services and education and to combat rising crime.
	   ``He's honest and he has kept his promises to Quito. You can see
his work everywhere,'' Mauricio Fiallos, 38, a computer tecnician,
said after he left a voting booth at a school in a middle-class
Quito neighborhood.
	   The 47-year-Noboa is running as an independent. But despite his
wealth he has the backing of Bucaram's Roldosista party, which dubs
itself ``the force of the poor.'' Resorting to Bucaram's populist
style, he promised to create 1 million jobs and build 200,000 homes
for the poor.

Sri Lankan press praises New Zealand spinners 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan newspapers on Monday
praised New Zealand spinners for pulling off a 167-run victory over
home team in the first cricket Test.
	   ``Sri Lanka's quest to fix New Zealand on a slow turning pitch
totally back-fired as the Kiwis turned the table,'' said the
English language Island newspaper.
	   The test that ended over the weekend was a big disappointment
for this cricket-crazy nation of 18 million people. Though one-day
world champions, Sri Lanka has been trying to prove its credentials
as a good test side.
	   The team didn't distinguish itself on the recent tour of South
Africa where it lost both the tests and couldn't make it to the
finals of a triangular series involving host South Africa and
Pakistan.
	   On Sunday, Sri Lanka chased a victory target of 465 in 134 overs
but it succumbed tamely to New Zealand's spin attack and was bowled
out for 297 runs. Spinners Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman shared
eight of Sri Lanka's second inning wickets.
	   Wiseman, a 28-year-old off-spinner from Auckland, returned a
match figure of 46.5-17-82-5 on his Test debut.
	   ``Sri Lanka's top order batting once more crumbled to
pressure,'' said The Daily News.
	   The tourists will now travel to the southern city of Galle, 110
kilometers (68 miles) from Colombo to play the second Test of
three-test series, beginning Wednesday.

Officials call for tougher laws to combat copyright piracy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials said Monday they may have to make
buying pirated compact discs illegal as part of Hong Kong's war
against copyright piracy.
	   Speaking at a three-day international conference, Secretary for
Trade and Industry Brian Chau, said if the government does not see
a fall in demand for pirated goods, officials may have to review
whether consumers can continue to buy them without fear of
prosecution.
	   Chau said the government would ensure that ``all relevant issues
are taken into account.''
	   The Hong Kong official added that regional law enforcement
agencies have to cooperate to fight piracy on the Internet. He said
Hong Kong has some of the best laws protecting copyright on the
Internet.
	   Authorities in Hong Kong and other territories in the region are
under pressure, particularly from the United States, to do a better
job of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say Hong
Kong has become a production center as well as a distribution
center since officials in mainland China began cracking down.
	   U.S. officials last month decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watchlist for copyright violation.
	   Hong Kong last year passed what officials said is one of the
toughest anti-pirating laws in the world. Customs officials also
have staged several high-profile raids.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video CDs and production equipment worth 650
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 83 million) in the biggest
such seizure in Hong Kong's history.
	   Despite the government's efforts to crack down on piracy, no
less than 100 shops across the territory still openly sell pirated
video or music CDs and computer software in shopping malls or on
the street.
	   These shops sell recently released movies or music discs for
about 35 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.50) each. Popular software,
including the soon-to-be-released Windows 98, are sold for a
fraction of the price of a legitimate copy.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, speaking at the same conference,
said the government is committed to cracking down on piracy, but
Hong Kong ``is a telecommunications center and a leading center for
film and television production. The demand for cheap pirated
optical discs is considerable and this provides the incentive for
piracy or counterfeiting.''

Japanese tourists head overseas to get Viagra 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese travel agency is putting together tours
to Hawaii for men who want to buy the drug Viagra, which has gotten
huge publicity here but has yet to be approved by health officials.
	   The Flight More travel agency organized its first Viagra tour in
April, and has flown 25 men to Hawaii for the drug, company
president Mineichi Sudo said Monday.
	   Sudo said the agency gets about 10 queries a day and is planning
more tours. Sudo said most of the participants are in their
fifties, with the youngest so far 45 and the oldest 64. Most of the
participants go on the tour alone and are met by a guide in
Honolulu.
	   Sudo said participants need to get blood tests from a Japanese
doctor before leaving. The results are faxed to a doctor in Hawaii
who then prescribes the drug, which can help men overcome some
forms of impotency.
	   Flight More's cheapest tour _ which lasts four days _ costs
98,000 yen (dlrs 710) for accommodations and flight. An additional
dlrs 600 is needed for the consultation, prescription, and first
bottle of 30 Viagra tablets.
	   The second bottle is available for dlrs 300.
	   Two bottles are the maximum a participant can bring through
Japanese customs, according to Flight More. Any more than that
requires a doctor's letter explaining why it is needed.
	   Sudo said that so far, ``none of the participants have
complained.''

Prime minister of breakaway Georgian province killed in southern Russia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot and killed the prime
minister of Georgia's separatist region of South Ossetia, a Russian
news agency reported Monday.
	   The attack in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz killed
Prime Minister Valery Khubulov along with a Russian businessman,
Sergei Zlenko, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The two gunmen escaped in a car, which they later blew up, the
report said.
	   South Ossetia, populated mostly by ethnic Ossetians, broke away
from Georgia in 1990 when it was still part of the Soviet Union,
calling for unity with ethnic brethren in Russia's North Ossetia.
	   The fighting ended after Russian peacekeepers were deployed in
the region in 1992, but talks on political settlement have stalled.
	   Khubulov was head of South Ossetia's armed forces during the
conflict, Interfax said.
	   Investigators are being sent from Moscow to Vladikavkaz, the
capital of North Ossetia, Interfax said.

Hong Kong, Tokyo stock markets drop sharply 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong and Tokyo stocks were down sharply
Monday amid rising fears of recession.
	   After a battering last week, capped by the government's
announcement late Friday that the economy contracted 2 percent in
the first quarter, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index headed
down again. It dropped 224.36 points or 2.5 percent in the morning
session, finishing at 8,710.20.
	   Enthusiasm over the government's new economic recovery program
unveiled Friday drove the index to a high of 9,089.41 points in
early morning.
	   But overseas fund managers began selling heavily, an indication
that they did not believe that the government's measures would lead
to economic recovery soon.
	   The contraction in the first quarter was the first in 13 years.
Officials and analysts expect more bad news, with the possibility
of growth picking up again sometime in the second half of the year.
The government countered Friday with a seven-point economic program
to strengthen the economy.
	   Meanwhile, Singapore's main index closed down 1.2 percent at
midday. Tokyo share prices finished sharply lower amid renewed
worries about the health of Japan's economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 349.75 points,
or 2.23 percent, to close at 15,321.03 points. On Friday, the index
had lost 125.77 points, or 0.80 percent.
	   Traders said selling of blue chips by overseas investors pushed
the Nikkei average sharply lower. Domestic institutional investors
later joined in the selling.
	   Hurting sentiment were recent signs that Japan's economic woes
have deepened. On Friday, the government said Japan's unemployment
rate hit a record 4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in March.

Wild gunfire greets victory by Milosevic foe quotes, Bulatovic accepts results, updated results. 
</HEADLINE>

Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with celebrations, Djukanovic
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Wild gunfire erupted in downtown
Monday as revelers celebrated the victory in Montenegro's
parliamentary elections of the biggest challenger to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   With 72 percent of the vote counted, the Election Commission in
the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics said Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic's coalition had captured 50.4 percent of
the ballots compared to 34.3 percent for Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic.
	   Djukanovic's triumph was a new blow to Milosevic's 11-year rule,
already dented by a virtual war in the Serbian province of Kosovo
in which ethnic Albanian militants are gaining ground against
police.
	   Djukanovic addressed several hundred wildly cheering supporters,
some of them firing guns in the air, and all singing patriotic
songs.
	   ''Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,''
Djukanovic said.
	   ``This is not our final victory,'' he added. ``Our final victory
will be when democracy wins throughout Yugoslavia.''
	   Milosevic took command of Serbia in 1987 and set a nationalist,
autocratic course, spurring wars that helped unraveled the former
Yugoslav federation.
	   Djukanovic, 36, is the first man with executive power to
challenge him.
	   ``This is a major victory for democracy _ and light at the end
of the tunnel,'' said Novak Kilibarda, leader of one of the parties
making up Djukanovic's ``For a Better Life'' coalition.
	   Serbia and Montenegro are the two remaining republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite widespread fears that Milosevic's supporters would not
recognize the results, the camp of his protege Bulatovic said they
would abide by the outcome, and called the elections free and fair.
	   Only three parties _ Djukanovic's coalition, Bulatovic's and the
Montenegrin separatist Liberal Party _ made it into the 78-seat
republican parliament.
	   Among those who surprisingly missed the 3 percent barrier was
Serbia's ultranationalist Radical Party. Its leader Vojislav
Seselj, a partner of Milosevic in Serbia's government, expressed
surprise at the margin of Djukanovic's triumph.
	   If the trend shown by partial results is confirmed, Djukanovic's
coalition should be able to form Montenegro's government without
partners.
	   More importantly, Djukanovic could name the bulk of Montenegro's
deputies to the federal Yugoslav Parliament, which elects and can
unseat the Yugoslav president.
	   If those deputies teamed up with lawmakers from Serbia's
opposition, they could vote Milosevic out of office.
	   For that reason, Sunday's election was keenly contested _ with
Milosevic's camp denouncing Djukanovic as a criminal and suggesting
it would not accept a win for the Montenegrin rebel.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe dispatched some 120 monitors to Sunday's election, and was
to declare Monday whether it considered the vote free and fair.
	   Djukanovic has won strong support from the United States and
western Europe for his defiance of Milosevic, his pro-Western
reformist policies and inclusion of minority ethnic Albanians in
his previous government.
	   Both he and Bulatovic rose in the late 1980s under the patronage
of Milosevic. But Djukanovic turned against his former mentor
during massive anti-Milosevic protests in the winter of 1996-97.
	   Montenegro, a republic of 630,000 people, has a tradition of
settling scores with the weapons that many keep at home. Hospital
officials said four people were wounded during gunfire late Sunday.
	   Tensions between the rival camps soared as polls closed when
riot police loyal to Djukanovic were deployed to block off
Bulatovic's party headquarters.
	   Police sources said they had acted to prevent planned violence
by Bulatovic supporters.
	   Hours earlier, Bulatovic threatened to shoot at police outside
the apartment house where he and Djukanovic still are neighbors,
local independent media said. Bulatovic later issued a statement
saying he became angry because the police had harassed his wife and
children.

Globalization worsens child sexual abuse; clean governments needed 
</HEADLINE>
By GRANT PECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Globalization is turning the world into
a more dangerous place for children to be exploited for sex, making
clean government and uncorrupt officials ever more necessary to
protect them, a former Thai prime minister said Monday.
	   ``It has become easier for the traffic in children by means of
abduction, tricks and enticements both within countries and across
borders,'' said Anand Panyarachun, opening a Asia-Pacific
conference on human resources development for youths.
	   The week-long conference, hosted by the United Nations' Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, was told an
estimated 10 million children worldwide were working as
prostitutes, with some 1 million being added every year.
	   Meanwhile, the Internet has put a tool into the hands of
pornographers to spread thousands of sexual pictures of children
around the world at ``the push of a button,'' Anand said.
	   ``Children are dealt with as commodities, traded and exchanged
as part of an increasingly borderless world,'' said Anand, who led
reformist governments in 1991 and 1992 in a country notorious for
child prostitution.
	   Currently the United Nations Children's Fund ambassador to
Thailand, Anand said that trafficking was abetted by governments
that allow corruption enabling law enforcement officials to turn a
blind eye to _ or help for profit _ gangs exploiting children.
	   Government transparency and enforcement of what Anand called
``child-friendly laws'' would go a long way toward cleaning up an
environment that allows the ``dark forces'' of corrupt police and
criminals exploiting children to thrive.
	   Anand suggested a series of measures to promote child rights and
good governance, including improved screening and training of law
enforcement personnel, more support and incentives for good law
enforcement and greater penalties for corruption.
	   Poverty breeds abuse and exploitation, Anand said, while lack of
access to education renders children more vulnerable to the sex
market. Family disintegration, migration and negative traditional
practices are also factors.

Mild quake shakes Mito 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A mild earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
5.9 shook Tokyo and wide areas of northern Japan at 4:36 p.m.
(0736GMT) Monday, but there were no immediate reports of damage and
injuries.
	   The Central Meteorological agency said the quake registered an
intensity of two on a Japanese scale of seven in Tokyo and
Fukushima, 239 kilometers (149 miles) northeast Tokyo.
	   The tremor was strong enough to rattle doors. It also forced a
shinkansen, or bullet train, to stop for 12 minutes near the
central Japan city of Nagoya because of a power outage, a
spokeswoman for Central Japan Railway said.
	   The agency placed the focus of the quake about 400 kilometers
(240 miles) underground in Mie, central Japan.
	   Four minutes earlier, another quake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.2 shook Mito, 100 kilometers (63 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
The agency said that quake registered an intensity of one on the
Japanese scale.

Ad agency apologizes over using Hitler to sell potato chips with client whether to pull ad. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency was consulting
with its client Monday to decide whether a controversial commercial
using Adolf Hitler to sell potato chips should be pulled from Thai
television.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai branch of the global ad agency,
has expressed regrets after Israeli diplomats said they found the
advertising campaign, which is confined to Thailand, disgusting and
insensitive.
	   An agency spokeswoman, Simone Wheeler, said that discussions
were under way Monday with the Thai client, Food Processing Co.
Ltd., on ``the future of the advertisement'' for X potato chips, a
brand aimed at Thai teenagers.
	   In a statement issued Sunday, the agency said it ``wishes to
apologize to any persons who may be offended by a recent television
commercial for a potato crisp that uses images of Adolf Hitler.''
	   It shows Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman whom
Leo Burnett said ``clearly wants to change his evil ways by casting
a voodoo spell over him as he eats the crisps.''
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   ``The commercial is targeted to Thai teen-agers and is designed
to communicate that the world would be a better place if happiness
ruled. It was never intended to offend and the agency apologizes to
anyone who finds it sensitive,'' the statement said.
	   The poster version, displayed on many of the motorized
three-wheeled taxis plying Bangkok, suggests that eating the chips
would transform Hitler into a fun-loving Charlie Chaplin character.
	   The agency said it ``acknowledges Hitler as one of history's
most despicable dictators and would never do anything to suggest
otherwise.''
	   Israeli Embassy officials were not available for comment.
	   Hitler fanned fanatical nationalism in Germany and unleashed
World War II in Europe, wreaking death across the continent. Six
million Jews and millions of other civilians he viewed as subhuman
were murdered.

Mir's computer problem threatens U.S. shuttle launch 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After running smoothly for months, Mir's main
computer has turned skittish and was out of order for a third day
Monday, threatening to postpone the Russian space station's last
rendezvous with a U.S. shuttle.
	   U.S. space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday
and dock with the station on Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew
Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on the Russian
outpost.
	   But that trip to the Mir is now in doubt since the shuttle can
only dock with the station when its computer-controlled steering
system properly aligns it for the docking.
	   ``We hope that the crew will finally resolve the problem later
today,'' said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian Mission
Control.
	   He said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   ``They still have a lot of spares to fix the problem,'' Lyndin
told The Associated Press.
	   He said the crew will resume attempts to restart the computer
later on Monday when the station moves into a position that will
permit it to relay the necessary data to ground controllers.
	   During a chat with ground controllers, Musabayev said the
situation on board ``isn't bad'' but added that he was concerned
about the problem on the eve of the shuttle's launch, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a shuttle ferry flight
in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months of
trouble-free operation. The station's crew has replaced it with a
back-up computer brought up by a Russian cargo ship.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply is
threatened because it can't keep its solar panels in optimum
alignment with the sun.
	   Depending on how much energy was lost, it can take from one to
three days to get the orientation system fully on-line.
	   Fortunately, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was
on the so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight
round the clock. As a result, the Mir's solar panels have remained
in full sunlight.
	   The crew also shut down some systems to save energy, and as a
result Mir's batteries were full on Monday, which will make it
easier for the crew to restore the orientation system, Lyndin said.

Indonesian students rally against U.S. policy outside embassy

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 50 students rallied peacefully
Monday outside the U.S. Embassy against what they said were U.S.
attempts to delay foreign loans to Indonesia.
	   Flanked by soldiers in camouflage uniforms, the protesters sat
down at the gates and chanted slogans against U.S. intervention in
the affairs of their economically-shattered country.
	   They accused the United States of conspiring to stall the
disbursement of aid tied to a dlrs 43 billion rescue package led by
the International Monetary Fund. The loans were suspended amid
political turmoil that led to the May 21 resignation of President
Suharto.
	   The demonstrators stuck posters in the embassy gates that read:
``America, don't intervene in our country,'' and ``IMF, give your
loan package immediately.''
	   Women at the rally wore Islamic shawls and the men were in red
university jackets. The protesters, members of a Muslim students'
association, accused the United States of religious discrimination
against Indonesia, which is overwhelmingly Muslim.
	   A top IMF official, Hubert Neiss, left Indonesia on Saturday
after a visit to assess when the IMF should release its next dlrs 1
billion loan to the nation of 202 million people. He was scheduled
to report to the IMF directors later Monday.
	   The United States is a key player in the 182-nation lending
agency, which is based in Washington.
	   ``We really want support from America because this country is
very dominant in the negotiations between Indonesia and the IMF,''
said Irwan Badillah, a protest organizer.
	   Student protesters helped hasten the downfall of Suharto, who
rose to power in the 1960s, but lost his authoritarian grip as
discontent grew over deepening economic hardship.

Islamic organization urges India-Pakistan talks after nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A leading Islamic organization on
Monday expressed ``deep concern'' over nuclear tests carried out
this month by India and Pakistan and urged immediate talks by the
two nations.
	   The Jiddah-based Organization of the Islamic Conference said in
a statement from its secretary-general, Azeddine Laraki, that it
had wanted the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in South
Asia.
	   ``Following the latest nuclear explosions carried out by India
and Pakistan, the secretary-general of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference expressed his deep concern over this serious
development,'' the statement said.
	   ``In the wake of these nuclear explosions, the international
community must seriously encourage both India and Pakistan to
expediently conclude a non-aggression agreement with the aim of
ensuring the promotion of peace and security in the region,'' it
said.
	   India exploded five nuclear devices two weeks ago, prompting
Pakistan to follow suit despite warnings from the U.N. Security
Council, the United States and other nations.
	   Pakistan said it detonated five nuclear devices on Thursday and
another one Saturday.
	   India has fought three wars with Pakistan since both countries
gained independence from colonial British rule in 1947.
	   The 55-member organization said in its statement that it hoped
Pakistan's nuclear explosions would not fuel anti-Muslim sentiment.
	   It urged ``international public opinion to foil every biased
attempt aimed at using the latest nuclear explosions as a pretext
to launch an unjustifiable offensive against the Islamic (world).''
It added that Islamic states have always supported elimination of
nuclear arms.
	   Pakistan is the only Muslim nation known to have developed a
nuclear bomb.

Tokyo stocks tumble amid deepening worries over economy, dollar rises

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy
triggered a 2.23 percent decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index on Monday and drove the U.S. dollar higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 349.75 points,
closing at 15,321.03 points. On Friday, the index had shed 125.77
points, or 0.80 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 139.12 yen, up 0.40 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
138.90 yen Friday. During Tokyo trading, the dollar rose as high as
139.33 yen, a level not seen since early July 1991.
	   ``The state of the economy is extremely bad,'' said Sachio
Ishikawa, general manager at Chuo Securities.
	   Selling of blue chips by overseas investors pushed the Nikkei
average sharply lower, traders said. They said hedge selling of
stock futures contracts by domestic institutional investors also
contributed to the decline.
	   On top of continued weakness of other Asian economies, a series
of bleak economic indicators recently have signaled that Japan's
economic woes have deepened.
	   On Friday, the government said Japan's jobless rate hit a record
4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in March.
	   On Monday, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said sales
of new cars, trucks and buses fell in May from a year earlier for
the 14th consecutive month as the sluggish domestic economy
continued to keep consumers from dealer showrooms.
	   Trading remained thin, with an estimated 320 million shares
changing hands on the first section, down from Friday's 346 million
shares. Retreating issues outnumbered advances by 889 to 222, with
135 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent, to 1,196.70.
The TOPIX fell 2.24 points, or 0.18 percent on Friday.
	   The sharp slide in the Tokyo stock market drove the dollar above
139.00 yen, a level that dollar bulls had recently found difficult
to break, traders said.
	   ``The weak stock and bond market is making it that much easier
to buy the dollar and break through resistance,'' said Eji Takane,
deputy general manager of foreign exchange at Asahi Bank.
	   Uncertainty in South Asia following Pakistan's sixth nuclear
test Saturday along with the weakness in the Japanese economy
continued to draw investors to the dollar.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to a record low of 1.155 percent from Friday's
finish of 1.205 percent, driving its price higher to 112.41 yen
from 112.04 yen.

Russian markets lower despite U.S. support 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nervous markets sank farther in early
trading Monday despite U.S. promises to support new loans by
international lenders.
	   In a brief statement issued Sunday, President Bill Clinton
expressed U.S. support for aid to Russia from such multinational
institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   Nonetheless, by midday the stock market was down an additional
4.5 percent, although traders said there was little panic selling.
	   ``We are seeing a manageable fall,'' said Robert Devane, head of
fixed-income trading at Moscow's Troika-Dialog brokerage. ``We are
not yet at a critical point like last week.''
	   Russian leaders have been working to stabilize the financial
markets after a wave of panic selling last week caused the stock
market to plummet and threatened a run on the national currency,
the ruble.
	   Altogether the stock market is down 40 percent since April. The
Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and raised
interest rates to 150 percent to convince investors to stay in
Russia.
	   The ruble was weaker in trading early Monday, but had fallen
only a few cents on the dollar.
	   Before the crisis, Russia's economic prospects had been looking
somewhat brighter, having kept a lid on inflation and recording its
first economic growth since the Soviet collapse.
	   But the government has been unable to solve a years-long
payments crisis, caused by its inability to collect taxes and
therefore to pay wages to state workers. Many workers and
pensioners have been unpaid for months on end.
	   Russia's new tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, said in an interview
Monday that the country's 35 percent tax rate must be lowered but
enforcement strengthened.
	   ``The rate should be 20 percent, but then those who do not pay
must in effect be put into prison,'' he told the NTV network.
	   He also said Russians must get used to the idea of paying taxes.
Only a small percent of Russians file income tax.
	   ``Individual taxes constitute the lion's share of the taxation
base in any normal country...'' he said. ``Where there are incomes,
there are taxes.''
	   Russian leaders have said that the crisis was triggered by a
combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices for
gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.
	   Russia has said it is not seeking a bailout package, but it is
eager to get the latest installments of a dlrs 10 billion loan from
the IMF.
	   IMF officials have said that they will recommend releasing a
delayed dlrs 700 million loan installment.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A protege of President Ernesto Samper
narrowly won the first round in Colombia's presidential race, but

Indonesian president names new advisers to help battle economic crisis 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Enlisting reinforcements to battle
Indonesia's most daunting economic crisis in 30 years, new
President B.J. Habibie has named a fresh team of economic advisers,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Monday.
	   The team includes economist Widjojo Nitisastro, who headed a
team of advisers set up earlier this year by former President
Suharto, former Finance Minister Frans Seda, and Ali Wardhana, also
formerly an adviser to Suharto.
	   Akbar said the new team will advise the president on all
problems affecting the crisis-ridden Indonesian economy and on the
government's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Their advice will supplement the work of Habibie's economic
ministers, led by Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Industry
and Finance Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   Ginandjar and his team met last week in Jakarta with Hubert
Neiss, the IMF's director for Asia and Pacific Affairs. They
predicted the economy will contract by at least 10 percent this
year.
	   Neiss said Indonesia's economic and political situation merited
the resumption of the dlrs 43 billion bailout package that the
agency is supervising for Indonesia.
	   The IMF suspended disbursements last month because of political
turmoil that led to the resignation of President Suharto after 32
years of rule.
	   Neiss was scheduled to report to other IMF officials on the
visit at the agency's Washington headquarters later on Monday.

Assad frees political prisoners, says rights group 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The government of Syrian President Hafez
Assad has released some 30 political prisoners and human rights
activists jailed for opposing the regime, a human rights group said
Monday.
	   Some of the activists freed this week have spent 18 years
without trial, said Haitham Manaq, a spokesman for the exiled
Organization of Defense Committees for Democratic Freedoms and
Human Rights in Syria.
	   Among them were Riyad al-Turk, a leader of the opposition
Communist Party who was jailed in 1980, and Akram Nuais, a leading
human rights activist imprisoned since 1991, Manaq said.
	   He said the rest are members of opposition and human rights
groups and Kurdish activists who have been jailed without charges
or trial for lengthy periods.
	   ``We welcome the release, but we believe it is only a partial
move, '' he told The Associated Press by telephone from his Paris
headquarters.
	   Assad's government has long been criticized by human rights
groups who claim it holds thousands of political prisoners. It was
unclear why prisoners were freed now, but could be a gesture ahead
of a visit Assad plans to France later this year.
	   Syria is still believed to hold some 2,500 political prisoners
including two who have been in jail for nearly 28 years. Khalil
Berayez and Moustafa Falah were imprisoned immediately after Assad
came to power in a military coup in September 1970.
	   Since 1995, Syria has been quietly releasing political
detainees, including some who took part in a 1982 revolt against
Assad's rule.
	   Manaq urged Syria to free the rest of the detainees, especially
those who are seriously sick or have spent long terms in jail.

Russian border guards detain North Korean fisherman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards detained 13 North Korean
trawlers Monday suspected of illegal fishing in the Bering Sea in
the Russian Far East, a news report said.
	   The boats have been escorted to the regional center of
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The report didn't say how the trawlers managed to reach Russia's
waters, or how many people may have been on the boats. North Korea
is suffering from a deep famine, but tight border controls in the
totalitarian state make it extremely difficult to leave its
territory.
	   Many North Korean defectors are living illegally in Russia with
the hope of reaching capitalist South Korea.

Wild gunfire greets victory by Milosevic foe quotes, Bulatovic accepts results, updated results. 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with celebrations, Djukanovic
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Wild gunfire erupted Monday as
revelers celebrated the victory in Montenegro's parliamentary
elections of the biggest challenger to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   With 72 percent of the vote counted, the Election Commission in
the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics said Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic's coalition had captured 50.4 percent of
the ballots compared to 34.3 percent for Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic.
	   Djukanovic's triumph was a new blow to Milosevic's 11-year rule,
already dented by a virtual war in the Serbian province of Kosovo
in which ethnic Albanian militants are gaining ground against
police.
	   Djukanovic addressed several hundred wildly cheering supporters,
some of them firing guns in the air, and all singing patriotic
songs.
	   ``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,''
Djukanovic said.
	   ``This is not our final victory,'' he added. ``Our final victory
will be when democracy wins throughout Yugoslavia.''
	   Milosevic took command of Serbia in 1987 and set a nationalist,
autocratic course, spurring wars that helped unraveled the former
Yugoslav federation.
	   Djukanovic, 36, is the first man with executive power to
challenge him.
	   ``This is a major victory for democracy _ and light at the end
of the tunnel,'' said Novak Kilibarda, leader of one of the parties
making up Djukanovic's ``For a Better Life'' coalition.
	   Serbia and Montenegro are the two remaining republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite widespread fears that Milosevic's supporters would not
recognize the results, the camp of his protege Bulatovic said they
would abide by the outcome, and called the elections free and fair.
	   Only three parties _ Djukanovic's coalition, Bulatovic's and the
Montenegrin separatist Liberal Party _ made it into the 78-seat
republican parliament.
	   Among those who surprisingly missed the 3 percent barrier was
Serbia's ultranationalist Radical Party. Its leader Vojislav
Seselj, a partner of Milosevic in Serbia's government, expressed
surprise at the margin of Djukanovic's triumph.
	   If the trend shown by partial results is confirmed, Djukanovic's
coalition should be able to form Montenegro's government without
partners.
	   More important, Djukanovic could name the bulk of Montenegro's
deputies to the federal Yugoslav Parliament, which elects and can
unseat the Yugoslav president.
	   If those deputies teamed up with lawmakers from Serbia's
opposition, they could vote Milosevic out of office.
	   For that reason, Sunday's election was keenly contested _ with
Milosevic's camp denouncing Djukanovic as a criminal and suggesting
it would not accept a win for the Montenegrin rebel.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe dispatched some 120 monitors to Sunday's election, and was
to declare Monday whether it considered the vote free and fair.
	   Djukanovic has won strong support from the United States and
western Europe for his defiance of Milosevic, his pro-Western
reformist policies and inclusion of minority ethnic Albanians in
his previous government.
	   Both he and Bulatovic rose in the late 1980s under the patronage
of Milosevic. But Djukanovic turned against his former mentor
during massive anti-Milosevic protests in the winter of 1996-97.
	   Montenegro, a republic of 630,000 people, has a tradition of
settling scores with the weapons that many keep at home. Hospital
officials said four people were wounded during gunfire late Sunday.
	   Tensions between the rival camps soared as polls closed when
riot police loyal to Djukanovic were deployed to block off
Bulatovic's party headquarters.
	   Police sources said they had acted to prevent planned violence
by Bulatovic supporters.
	   Hours earlier, Bulatovic threatened to shoot at police outside
the apartment house where he and Djukanovic still are neighbors,
local independent media said. Bulatovic later issued a statement
saying he became angry because the police had harassed his wife and
children.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news GUYANA: Jamaican prime minister visits as country braces for audit results 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ As shopkeepers fearing race riots
began covering windows with protective shutters, Jamaica's leader
visited Guyana on Sunday to urge calm before the release of an
audit of December elections.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said he had come to show
international backing for the results of the audit, which was done
by a team of Caribbean Community election experts. The results are
expected Tuesday.
	   The elections divided Guyanese of East Indian descent, who
mostly back the ruling People's Progressive Party, and those of
African descent, who identify with the rival People's National
Congress.
	   ``Guyana cannot be allowed to slip into a state of ethnic
division or social polarization,'' Patterson said Sunday.
  TRINIDAD: Government expels 20 Chinese construction workers
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Responding to complaints from
labor officials, the Trinidad government said it will expel 20
Chinese construction workers this week because their work could be
done by local residents.
	   The Chinese men, including carpenters, masons and electricians,
were working on three primary schools being built by the China
Jiang Sue International Economic Cooperation construction company.
The company is affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
	   The 20 workers have been ordered to leave by Friday, a statement
from the Trinidadian government said Saturday.
	   In March, the government turned down work permits for 24 of 36
Chinese hired to work on the dlrs 51 million project after labor
leaders accused immigration officials of letting construction
workers slip in.
  TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Researchers to test AIDS vaccine
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Researchers in Trinidad and
Tobago said they will begin injecting volunteers with an
experimental AIDS vaccine that has caused controversy in Uganda,
another test site for the formula.
	   Doctors at the Medical Research Foundation of Trinidad and
Tobago said last week they will begin testing ALVAC-HIV, a vaccine
developed at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, on 20 virus-free
people to see if it will prompt creation of antibodies to fight the
disease. Trials will begin in 2000.
	   Tests of the vaccine in Uganda last year were delayed after some
politicians voiced unfounded worries that the formula might create
another, stronger strain of the virus that causes AIDS. Opponents
of the trials also accused researchers of using residents of
lesser-developed countries as guinea pigs for the drug.
  BAHAMAS: Police catch two of five escaped prisoners
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Two of five prisoners who escaped from
prison Saturday by chiseling through a concrete roof were captured
hours later, police reported Sunday.
	   Police warned residents the other fugitives were still free and
were armed.
	   The five prisoners squeezed through the hole in the maximum
security section of the prison sometime after the 7 a.m. roll call
Saturday. Officers caught Melvin Saunders, serving a 25-year
sentence for rape, and Wade Higgs, who was awaiting trial for
murder, in downtown Nassau a few hours later.
	   The other fugitives were identified as convicted robbers Douglas
Cleare and Kevin Roker, and manslaughter convict Vaughn George.
  UNITED STATES: Publicist confirms Cindy Crawford's Bahamas
marriage
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Supermodel Cindy Crawford married longtime
friend Rande Gerber in a ceremony on a beach in the Bahamas, her
spokeswoman confirmed Sunday.
	   The couple was surrounded by family and close friends during
Friday's wedding at The Ocean Club Resort on Paradise Island,
publicist Annett Wolf said in a statement.
	   Friend and songwriter Bruce Roberts sang ``Have a Little Faith
in Me,'' accompanied by Jed Leiber.
	   Gerber owns the celebrity bars The Whiskey in New York and
Skybar in Los Angeles.
	   Crawford was previously married to actor Richard Gere.

TV, telephone, computer developments in Asia discussed 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific rim countries could sign an agreement
this week that would simplify certification of communication
equipment and allow foreign manufacturers greater access to Asia, a
U.S. official said Monday.
	   Communications equipment such as cellular phones and modems
currently must meet technological standards and be certified in
each of the countries where they'll be used.
	   The Mutual Recognition Agreement would allow manufacturers to
get their equipment certified by agencies in their own countries,
lowering the cost to consumers and getting the products to market
faster, said Larry Irving, assistant secretary of communications
and information at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
	   The United States and the European Union already have a similar
agreement.
	   ``It'll make things easier. If you make a handset in one market,
it won't be as difficult to jump over hurdles to have that handset
used in other markets,'' Irving said.
	   Irving was attending a meeting of ministers of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation to discuss liberalizing the telecommunications
business across borders and oceans.
	   The MRA agreement could go into effect by July 1999.
	   Irving told reporters that the U.S. was still ``bullish'' on the
Asian market, despite the regional economic crisis that has led
many investors to flee.
	   ``While people may be stretching out investment, and that's
real, you're not seeing anyone saying they're going to halt
investment,'' he said.
	   APEC ministers were also to discuss the expansion of the
Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure and Internet ``domains,''
the three-letter address endings such as .com.
	   In conjunction with the APEC meeting, the latest telephone,
computer and broadcast gadgets and systems went on display at the
CommunicAsia/NetworkAsia conference.
	   ``Governments are very concerned about what it means to be
giving away to the private sector ownership and management of
broadcasting,'' said Derek Nicholas, a consultant for the
CommunicASia/NetworkAsia conference.
	   ``This may well act as a retarding effect on using all this
super technology we've seen.''
	   Nicholas spoke at the opening press conference of the conference
and exhibition which covers 22,490 square meters over two sites and
is Singapore's second largest trade fair.
	   Displays at the booths for NetworkAsia, CommunicAsia,
BroadcastAsia, CableSat98 and MobileCommAsia show how the different
communications sectors are increasingly interrelated. The
exhibition, in its 12th year, is attended by 1,800 companies from
46 countries.
	   For the first time at a international trade fair, the three
different high definition television systems, developed separately
by the United States, Japan and Europe, are on display at the same
show, said Stephen Tan, managing director of Singapore Exhibition
Services.
	   ``Many countries, including Singapore, are in the process of
deciding which (of the HDTV systems) to adopt,'' Tan said. Japan
and Australia have said they will put HDTV into operation for
national broadcasting by 2000-2001.

After three small quakes, experts say no big one for Beijing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After three mild earthquakes bumped Beijing,
government seismologists insisted Monday that the Chinese capital
would not be struck by a big quake.
	   The three tremors _ the largest of which had a preliminary
magnitude of 3.4 _ hit the capital Sunday night and early Monday,
state-run media reported. All were centered in Beijing's
southwestern Fengtai district and could be felt in the western half
of the city.
	   Government seismologists, paraded by state media to squelch any
panic in rumor-filled Beijing, called the quakes aftershocks from a
magnitude-6.2 earthquake that struck farming villages 250
kilometers (150 miles) to the north Jan. 10.
	   The tremors in Beijing do ``not mean that bigger, destructive
ones will follow,'' the Xinhua News Agency quoted Ding Jianhai, who
heads the government's earthquake warning center, as saying.
	   Ding pledged to issue timely warnings in the future if experts
predict a magnitude-5 or stronger quake will hit Beijing.
	   Chinese for centuries have seen earthquakes and other natural
disasters as portents of political change. North China's last major
quake killed 240,000 in Tangshan city on July 28, 1976. Within six
weeks, revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung was dead.

Passengers stranded as Air France strike begins 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Passengers were stranded Monday at airports across
France after Air France pilots began a strike that threatened to
disrupt travel plans during the World Cup soccer games.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: ``annule,'' _ canceled _ written in red next to almost
all international and domestic flights.
	   The strike began at midnight after Air France failed to reach an
agreement with pilots seeking to block wage cuts.
	   Air France set up special telephone lines for passengers seeking
information on flights. There was no immediate indication of how
many flights were canceled or which routes were most affected.
	   Most of the company's aircraft _ many of them decorated with
players representing the 32 World Cup teams _ remained grounded
Monday. Air France is the official carrier for the World Cup.
	   The World Cup, held every four years, will attract an estimated
one million people to France. The tournament kicks off June 10. A
combined audience of 40 billion is expected to view the four-week
soccer bonanza.
	   Air France expects to cancel 90 percent of long-haul flights for
the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and medium-haul flights
out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are likely to fly as
planned, the company has said, as are about 20 percent leaving from
Orly airport.
	   The spokesman for the leading union in the strike, the SNPL,
apologized to customers.
	   ``We have no other choice,'' Christian Paris said on France Info
radio on Sunday.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   Sarre, speaking Sunday on French television, said the pilots
were ``practicing blackmail on the company.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday. Most of the state-run carrier's 3,200 pilots were likely
to take part.
	   The pilots are asking the carrier to abandon a plan to save dlrs
83 million a year by cutting into their salaries, currently among
the highest in their field in the world. The cost-saving measure
also calls for pilots hired after June 1997 to begin at a lower

Serie A an option for Bosnich says manager 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was
wanted by former AC Milan manager Fabio Capello and Italy's Serie A
remained an option, his manager said Monday.
	   Villa manager John Gregory is trying to tie Bosnich to a
long-term contract but the Australian left England for a holiday in
the United States this week without making a decision.
	   ``Mark is not dissatisfied with Aston Villa and has been very
happy in his six years at the club,'' said Bosnich's Sydney-based
manager Leo Karis. ``Money is not an issue. Mark wants to know
about the club's recruitment strategy, how he would fit in and
whether it will be a competitive side.
	   ``There was also an approach by AC Milan last week but they
sacked (Capello) a few days ago and this option is up in the air.
	   ``However, Capello has always had an eye on him and indicated
wherever he takes a coaching position he will still be interested
in Mark.''
	   Bosnich has a year to run in his contract and has said he was
not in a hurry to sign until he has had time to relax.
	   He went to Aston Villa six years ago at the age of 20 and has
played over 200 league and Cup games with the club.
	   Karis said Bosnich was disappointed at the manner in which his
talks with the club had been portrayed by the English media.
	   He said there was never an ultimatum given to the keeper of sign
or be sold and the talks with Gregory had been friendly and
positive.
	   ``Mark just wants to be part of a highly competitive side and
had a good year in goal in the season just finished,'' said Karis.
	   ``He also put in star performances for the Socceroos in the
Confederation and World Cup matches as well as being named Oceania
Player of the Year. His future will be resolved over the next few
weeks after his much deserved holiday.''

Indonesia's Christian clergy complains to president about church burnings 
</HEADLINE>
By HARIS SYAMAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Eight leading Christian clergymen
appealed Monday to President B.J. Habibie to investigate the
burning of churches during riots in 1997.
	   In a meeting with the new president, they asked him to help
Christian communities rebuild their houses of worship.
	   The delegation, split evenly between Catholics and Protestants
and led by Bishop Jos Suwatan, chairman of the Indonesian Churches
Association, and Cardinal Julius Darmaamadja, conferred with
Habibie for nearly three hours.
	   ``The president responded positively and asked the Christian
community to work with the government,'' Darmaamadja said.
	   Indonesia's Christians are mostly members of the ethnic Chinese
minority, which makes up about 4 percent of the country's 202
million people. Muslims comprise 87 percent of the population.
	   The ethnic Chinese, who have generally been more economically
successful than the Muslims, were targeted by mobs that rampaged
through several Indonesian cities last month.
	   The rioters were angry over rising food and fuel prices, a
byproduct of the country's worst economic crisis in 30 years. Shops
and homes belonging to Chinese were burned and looted.
	   There were no reports of church burnings in the recent violence.
But churches were attacked in riots last year in Surabaya,
Indonesia's second-largest city, and several other towns in Java
island.
	   Last month's rioting, coupled with student protests over
political stagnation and corruption, helped force President Suharto
to step down May 21 after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Since assuming office, Habibie has strived to placate the
Chinese community. He visited burned out shops and told merchants
there was no place in Indonesia for prejudice and racism.
	   Chinese merchants control a good part of the country's
distribution system, which has been in a shambles since the riots.
Many entrepreneurs fled and have not returned.
	   Government and aid officials have warned of imminent food
shortages resulting from the wrecked distribution network.
	   ``The people are suffering from great misery,'' Suwatan said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Monday,
pushed down by worries that the territory's economic downturn could
last for some time.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 322.55 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 8,612.01.
	   Trading volume was 6.52 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 835
million), up from Friday's 5.06 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 648).
	   Investors were concerned over the government's announcement late
Friday that the economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter,
brokers said.
	   The contraction in the first quarter was the first in 13 years.
Officials and analysts expect more bad news, with the possibility
of growth picking up again sometime in the second half of the year.
	   Investors don't expect government measures to stimulate the
economy to have an effect in the near future, said Ben Kwong,
research director at Dharmala Securities Co.
	   Among property shares, Cheung Kong fell 2.30 Hong Kong dollars
to 39.60, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.80 dollars to 35.60.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 3.00 dollars to
185.00, and Hang Seng Bank also fell 3.00 dollars to 54.75.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 3.40 dollars to 37.10, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.90 dollars to 26.75.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot and killed a deputy prime
minister of Georgia's separatist region of South Ossetia, Russian
and Georgian officials said Monday.
	   The attack in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz killed
Deputy Prime Minister Valery Khubulov along with a Russian
businessman, said Irbek Khudov, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry.
	   The two gunmen escaped in a car, which they later blew up, he
said.
	   Officials inside South Ossetia confirmed that the deputy prime
minister had been killed, but provided no details.
	   South Ossetia, populated mostly by ethnic Ossetians, broke away
from Georgia in 1990 when it was still part of the Soviet Union,
calling for unity with ethnic brethren in Russia's North Ossetia.
Khubulov was head of South Ossetia's armed forces during the
conflict.
	   The fighting ended after Russian peacekeepers were deployed in
the region in 1992, but talks on a political settlement have
stalled.
	   The Russian businessman who also died in the attack was
identified as Sergei Zlenko, a metals trader, according to the
Interfax news agency.

Japan's governing coalition breaks up after four year alliance

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's governing coalition officially broke up
Monday ahead of parliamentary elections this summer, bringing an
end to a four-year alliance between formerly bitter rivals.
	   In a widely expected move, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
accepted the decision of the Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake to withdraw from the government, allowing his Liberal
Democratic Party to formally reclaim its position as sole ruling
party.
	   It ended an oddball marriage between the conservative LDP and
left-leaning Social Democrats, formerly Japan's socialist party.
Previous to linking up in June of 1996, the two parties had been
political enemies for most of the post-World War II era.
	   The coalition's demise was seen as unlikely to have much impact
on Hashimoto's administration. The Liberal Democratic Party has
already assumed all Cabinet posts and enjoys a majority in the more
powerful of Japan's two legislative chambers.
	   ``Over the past year, the coalition was mainly driven at the
LDP's pace and that left it in bad shape,'' said Masayoshi
Takemura, chairman of New Party Sakigake.
	   Social Democrat head Takako Doi said her party decided to end
its alliance with the LDP over disagreements with Hashimoto's party
on key legislative issues such as more stringent political ethics
and the strengthening of U.S.-Japan defense ties.
	   But the withdrawal was also viewed as a tactical move before
elections slated for sometime in July. Half of the seats in the
upper house of parliament will be up for grabs.
	   The pro-business Liberal Democratic Party has 261 seats in the
powerful 500-member lower house. With 118 seats in the less
powerful upper house, it still needs support from the 21-member
Social Democratic Party and three-member Sakigake to gain a
majority in the 252-member body.
	   The Social Democrats and Sakigake party were expected to
continue to vote with the LDP on a case-by-case basis. And the
Social Democrats have pledged to support Hashimoto's administration
if opposition parties submit a no-confidence vote against the
government.
	   Hashimoto said in a nationally televised interview Monday that
his party will respect the ``history of working together'' with the
two parties, indicating he will seek cooperation from them on some
issues.
	   Still, Hashimoto may need to court additional support from
independent lawmakers and non-aligned parties such as a lay
Buddhist political group which once had close ties to the LDP.
	   In June of 1996, the LDP joined hands with the Social Democrats
in what was dubbed an ``unholy alliance,'' producing Japan's first
socialist prime minister in 46 years.
	   While the two parties had long been rivals, they buried their
enmity in a bid to keep from power a reformist coalition made up of
political renegades from both parties.
	   The LDP was toppled from power by this reformist coalition in
July of 1993 after four decades as Japan's sole ruling party.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell in
May for the 14th straight month as the sluggish domestic economy
continued to keep consumers out of dealer showrooms.
	   Sales fell 8 percent in May from the year-earlier month to
294,211 units, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said
Monday. The sales are measures by new registrations.
	   Sales dropped 2.8 percent compared with April.
	   The sale of passenger cars was up slightly, 0.1 percent to
294,211, compared with the year before. Truck sales, however,
plunged 23.9 percent to 82,614 sold the year before. Sales of buses
were also down, falling 1.1 percent to 784.
	   While demand for Japanese cars remains robust in North America,
domestic Japanese consumption has lagged since a sales tax increase
last year. Exports to Asia have also fallen because the financial
crisis there sent local currencies into a tailspin.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A month after Japan's foreign currency supply
dipped due to intervention in support of the battered yen, the
Japanese Finance Ministry said Monday that the nation's exchange
reserves rose by dlrs 1.22 billion in May.
	   Japan's reserves totaled dlrs 206.98 billion last month, the
ministry said, giving it the world's largest supply of foreign
currency.
	   The increase comes after reserves in April declined by dlrs
17.84 billion compared to the previous month.
	   Supplies fell that month as the Bank of Japan waged an
aggressive campaign to prop up the weakening Japanese currency by
selling dollars and buying yen.
	   ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will not change its
projection of 2.5 percent growth for this year, despite new figures
that show the economy is in worse shape than previously thought,
the finance minister said Monday.
	   The Central Bank's announcement Saturday that Gross Domestic
Product shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter this year was
the worst sign yet of the country's economic problems, said Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But Anwar, who is also Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said
the news would not prompt the government to change its forecast for
this year, citing positive growth in April.
	   Economists regard two successive quarters of negative growth as
the criteria for a recession.
	   ``The worst is over for the country's economy,'' he said. The
figures for January to March 1998 ``shouldn't be taken out of
context.''
	   Malaysia's central bank, Bank Negara, is forecasting that
exports would grow, boosting the economy, even though regional
currencies have dropped dramatically in value since the onset of
the Asian financial crisis.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is unlikely to slip into a
recession this year despite a trend toward negative growth in
Southeast Asia, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament on
Monday.
	   ``The overall picture of the Singapore economy is one of
uncertainty,'' Hu told Parliament. But he stood by an earlier
government forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in economic
growth this year.
	   Some private analysts and economists have begun predicting
Singapore's economy would contract this year with a GDP of no more
than 1.5 percent. Three major international investment houses have
predicted recession.
	   Meanwhile, the government minister who heads the national trade
unions said layoffs this year would exceed the 20,000 who lost
their jobs during the 1985-86 recessions.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ While the latest telephone, computer and
broadcast gadgets and systems went on display Monday at a huge
exhibition, Asian telecommunications ministers talked about
regulation and privatization of the new technologies.
	   ``Governments are very concerned about what it means to be
giving away to the private sector ownership and management of
broadcasting,'' said Derek Nicholas, a consultant for the
CommunicASia/NetworkAsia conference.
	   Nicholas spoke at the opening press conference of the conference
and exhibition which covers 22,490 square meters over two sites and
is Singapore's second largest trade fair.
	   Displays at the booths for NetworkAsia, CommunicAsia,
BroadcastAsia, CableSat98 and MobileCommAsia show how the different
communications sectors are increasingly interrelated. The
exhibition, in its 12th year, is attended by 1,800 companies from
46 countries.
	   For the first time at a international trade fair, the three
different high definition television systems, developed separately
by the United States, Japan and Europe, are on display at the same
show.
	   In conjunction with the trade fair, 11 ministers from countries
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group are gathering to
discuss liberalizing the telecommunications business across borders
and oceans.
	   ___
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has decided
to allocate 1.5 trillion dong (dlrs 120 million) in preferential
bank loans for several key industries, the Dau Tu (Investment)
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The government originally set aside 6.6 trillion dong (dlrs 510
million) in preferential bank loans for priority projects, but the
garment, textile, footwear and machinery industries were not on the
list.
	   The interest rate will be 0.81 percent per month for loans in
dong and 8.5 percent per year for loans in U.S. dollars, with a
maximum payback period of 10 years.
	   Longer-term loans must seek approval from the prime minister.
	   Khai recently told government agencies to cut back inefficient
investment projects in sugar processing, breweries and hotels and
increase funding for projects which can find markets such as
bicycles, garments, textiles and footwear.

Deposed co-premier registers to vote in Cambodia's elections conquered, grafs 4-6 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Ranariddh fearing opposition will be divided,
<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh
registered to vote Monday in upcoming elections, backing off
threats to boycott if the polls are unlikely to be free and fair.
	   But Ranariddh, deposed as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup, said that his FUNCINPEC party may push to postpone the
July 26 vote to reduce the advantage held by his archrival,
strongman Hun Sen.
	   ``We should not talk about a boycott,'' Ranariddh told reporters
after receiving his voter registration card. ``But we should talk
about the possibility of postponing the election.''
	   Ranariddh expressed fears that the opposition vote would be
badly divided and ballots cast for his chief opposition rival, Sam
Rainsy, would ultimately benefit Hun Sen's powerful Cambodian
People's Party.
	   ``When the CPP wins, they will form a government with Sam
Rainsy, leaving us as an opposition party,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Sam Rainsy, once a leading light in FUNCINPEC who now heads his
own party, has voiced similar fears about Ranariddh, pointing up
the deep division and mistrust in the opposition to Hun Sen.
	   The opposition has accused Hun Sen of stacking the electoral
process in his favor to win the polls, which he hopes will restore
international legitimacy and aid lost due to his violent takeover
11 months ago.
	   As many as 90 of the prince's supporters were killed after the
coup and no one has ever been arrested. The opposition accuses Hun
Sen of intimidating opposition workers and coercing voters into
pledging support for his Cambodian People's Party.
	   Ranariddh said that if fewer than 80 percent of the 5.5 million
eligible voters register _ down from 90 percent who cast ballots in
the U.N.-brokered 1993 elections _ FUNCINPEC should ask to extend
the month-long registration process, now set to end June 15.
	   The prince reiterated concern about the opposition's limited
access to Hun Sen-controlled radio and television, calling a
present plan to allocate each political party only five minutes a
day to broadcast messages ``unacceptable.''
	   ``People must be informed about each of the parties' ...
political programs and platforms,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Last month, a coalition of opposition parties, including
FUNCINPEC, said it would boycott the elections unless conditions
were put in place to ensure the polls were credible and the
election date was pushed back.
	   The threat was largely intended to lure the international
community into helping pressure Hun Sen to comply with a minimal
criteria for fair elections.
	   But foreign diplomats, who have shown decreasing sympathy for
the opposition or its demands, have brushed the threat off as a
gimmick.

	   Also freed by Judge Japhet Banda was Moyce Kaulungombe, a senior
bodyguard of Kaunda, 74. Both men were charged with concealing
prior knowledge of an Oct. 28 coup attempt by junior military
officers that was quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale told Banda the state entered
a plea of ``nolle prosequi,'' the legal term for ``no
prosecution,'' a procedure normally used when the state lacks
sufficient evidence or does not wish to proceed with its case.
	   ``This means the state doesn't wish to proceed further. You are
discharged so you are free men,'' Banda told Kaunda and his
bodyguard.
	   Kaunda, wearing a long white beard grown since his arrest on
Christmas day, was mobbed by hundreds of cheering supporters
outside the court before being driven off to an unspecified
destination.
	   The drama came on the first day of the trials of 81 suspects _
most of them soldiers _ who were arrested after junior officers
stormed the state broadcast center and claimed to have overthrown
the government of President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Kaunda repeatedly denied charges against him that carry a
penalty of possible life imprisonment. Most of the other suspects
are charged with treason and face the death sentence.
	   Kaunda, head of an 11 party opposition alliance, was out of the
country during the coup attempt and accused the government of using
it to crush political enemies.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas have threatened
retaliation for an Israeli missile strike that hit civilians in
south Lebanon, while Israel warned of a tough response if shells
fall in Israeli territory.
	   The twin warnings raised fears in Lebanon of a new round or
cross-border fighting in which far more Lebanese die than Israelis.
In Israel, newspapers reported Monday that residents of northern
Israel spent the night in shelters in fear of a possible Hezbollah
attack.
	   ``The resistance ... cannot keep quiet in light of what has
happened,'' Sheik Nabil Kaouk, Hezbollah commander in the south,
told reporters Sunday night after weekend Israeli rocket attacks
killed a Lebanese shepherd and wounded his brother and another man.
	   In Israel, radio reports quoted the Israeli army's northern
command as warning it will respond ``harshly'' if rockets fall on
northern Israel.
	   The Israeli army also suggested Monday that the harm to
civilians was unintentional.
	   ``Israel has no interest in attacking citizens,'' an army
statement said, adding the targeted area ``is an open space and
anyone in it is suspected of being a terrorist or protecting
terrorists.''
	   Cross-border guerrilla rocket attacks triggered major fighting
in 1996 in which at least 175 people, mostly Lebanese civilians,
were killed.
	   Since then, Hezbollah has targeted the occupied zone and
occasionally Israeli positions along the international border for
retaliation.
	   On Sunday, Israeli troops fired a missile near a village in
southern Lebanon, killing a Lebanese shepherd and wounding his
brother, security officials said. On Saturday night, an Israeli
rocket attack injured a guerrilla near another village.
	   The Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, originally said two brothers were killed in the rocket
attack Sunday. But they later said one of the brothers had only
been wounded and was hospitalized.
	   Both targets hit by Israel are in a guerrilla mountain
stronghold on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border zone in the
south.
	   Hezbollah is leading the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the occupied zone. Israel or
its allies have controlled the zone for over 20 years, maintaining
the occupation is needed to guard against cross-border guerrilla
raids.

England gambles on young stand off 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England has topped Australia's
fly-half gamble with one of its own for the one-off rugby union
test match at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday.
	   Australia will pitch Stephen Larkham in at fly-half for the
first time in a test after his outstanding form as fullback last
year.
	   England's choice, Jonny Wilkinson, will play in the key position
in his test starting debut after just four minutes of test
football.
	   Like Larkham, Wilkinson does not play at fly-half for his club
team, having spent all season outside Rob Andrew as a center with
Newcastle.
	   ``I realize the fact that I'm young and there's a lot of
pressure,'' Wilkinson said Monday. ``I'm going to go in there with
the self confidence just like any fly-half would need. You are
going out there to play for the team and enjoy yourself, that's my
attitude. Everyone's come here with the right attitude, ready to
take on the challenge.''
	   England is a 7-1 outsider after sending a squad with 20 uncapped
players.
	   Larkham's selection was considered a calculated risk by
Australian selectors still trying to fill the void left when
Michael Lynagh retired in 1995.
	   England captain Matt Dawson does not believe Larkham will prove
a Wallaby weak point.
	   ``I wouldn't call it a weakness because across the board in
Australia they can all play in most positions, that's what can be a
strength for them,'' said Dawson.
	   ``This Larkham might be an answer, they might be looking
somewhere else. They've got players who can play in different areas
so they've got a few combinations.''
	   Larkham has confessed to having reservations about his new job.
He hopes two weeks of training will help him settle in.
	   ``That's all I'm concentrating on, getting used to the role,''
Larkham said. ``We've had two weeks until the first test which I'm
probably going to be using as a warm-up. Hopefully two weeks into
the test season I should be right.'' first Test together in a long
time and some of them are carrying injuries.''
	   Wallaby captain John Eales got through two full sessions at the
Caloundra training camp Monday despite tendinitis in a wrist. He
took part in scrummage, lineout and kickoff drills without any
problem.

Lonely heart Japanese seek mates with love beeper 
</HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lonely hearts are prowling the streets of Japan,
armed not with romantic haiku poems or long sultry looks, but with
the ultimate matchmaking tool of the electronic age.
	   The love beeper.
	   While the real name of the gadget _ ``Lovegety'' _ might not be
so fetching, the toy's makers _ and the 400,000 souls who have
bought one already _ are hoping it'll open the door to romance.
	   The Lovegety _ a rather straightforward mix of ``love'' and
``get'' _ is an oval disc that fits in your hand. It's carried on
forays into crowded places and sends out different signals,
depending on the setting.
	   When someone of the opposite sex carrying a Lovegety comes into
range, the two machines beep or flash. Then it's up to the would-be
lovers to seek each other out _ or run the other way.
	   The device, which came out in February, has three settings for
favorite activities: ``karaoke'' for romantic crooners, ``chat''
for those who want to talk, and ``friends'' for something, well,
more intimate.
	   ``This ... gives you a way to start a chat,'' said Takeya
Takafuji, executive planning director for the manufacturer, Erfolg.
``It's just one way to meet people.''
	   Erfolg, a small company that makes modems, said there a backlog
for more than 200,000 units, and the company is boosting production
this month. Sales to Singapore and Hong Kong are planned, and the
company expects the boom will increase annual revenues sevenfold to
dlrs 15 million.
	   The beeper, which retails for 2,980 yen (dlrs 22), can pick up
signals from 5 meters (yards) away. A flashing green light means a
match in interests, while red means there's a Lovegety next to you,
but you've got the wrong setting. The settings can be changed any
time, and the timid can keep the beeper off so only the lights will
flash.
	   Encouraged by brisk sales, the company plans to introduce an
upgraded version in August with more choices, such as ``movie,''
``drink'' and ``dinner.'' The new version will also pick up signals
from 100-meters (yards) way.
	   What if the person at the other end of the signal isn't The One?
	   ``If this middle-aged man isn't your type or you think there is
no way you want to talk to him, then you just walk away,'' said
Takafuji. ``He'll never notice.''

Philippines stocks decline; peso edges higher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell for a seventh
straight session Monday, with regional uncertainties and a lack of
positive domestic news discouraging buyers, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 15.40 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 1,996.05 after slipping 2.78 points Friday.
	   The index now has lost 152.56 points, or 7 percent, since May
22.
	   ``Foreign investors aren't in the market and in most of the
region since there's really no reason to invest,'' said Noel Reyes,
vice president for research at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.
	   Reyes expects the market's lethargic trading, due to the absence
of foreign investors, to continue for at least six months.
	   Traders said the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 70.25-point drop
to 8,899.95 Friday added to the market's selling mode, with local
investors cashing in their blue chips.
	   The poor, but largely expected, first-quarter economic growth
figures released last Friday were discounted by the market days
before their announcement, traders said. However, they continued to
cast a shadow over market sentiment.
	   ``The latest data raise concerns that the government won't even
meet its gross national product growth target for the year,'' said
Reyes. He said the government's optimism may be a ``state of
denial.''
	   GNP growth was 2.5 percent in the first quarter. The government
is targeting GNP growth at 3 percent to 4 percent for the full
year.
	   Losers trampled gainers, 67 to 13, while 46 issues closed
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed slightly higher against the
dollar, with slack demand for the U.S. currency helping to buffer
the peso from the weaker regional currency trend.
	   But with the peso's last trade at a session-low of 39.240 pesos
to the dollar, the Philippine currency is likely to weaken in early
transactions Tuesday, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.072 pesos for the day, down from 39.127
pesos Friday.
	   Dealers said falls on regional stock markets, coupled with the
likelihood of contractions in a number of regional economies,
pressured Southeast Asian currencies.
	   Dealers said the peso is likely to continue tracking the
regional currency trend in coming sessions.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday denied Pakistani
allegations it had plans to continue the nuclear test tit-for-tat
that has raised tensions in this already volatile region.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was
surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was
``surprising.''
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   India was the first to escalate the long-standing Indo-Pakistan
rivalry to the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In
response, Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices
last week.
	   ``I have credible information that they (the Indians) are
already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast
somewhere in the first or second week in July,'' Khan told CNN
Sunday.
	   Pakistan has not said whether it would test again. U.S.
intelligence sources said over the weekend they had detected no
signs that either Pakistan or India was readying new tests.
	   The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to
sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed in its
entirety by both countries. Indian-held Kashmir is the only
Muslim-majority state in the country.
	   Violence broke out Monday in Srinagar, the capital of
Indian-held Kashmir, after about 100 people opponents of Indian
rule distributed sweets in the streets _ a traditional way of
celebrating _ and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its
nuclear tests. Some of the protesters threw stones at police, who
responded by beating the protesters. The crowd dispersed after
about half an hour.
	   Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups
fighting either for Kashmir's independence or its union with
Pakistan. Pakistan says it lends them only moral support.

Markets plunge on recession fears; inflation at three-year high 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stocks and the currency took a
beating Monday on fears of a deepening recession in Asia, while new
inflation figures showed the country is suffering the stiffest
price hikes in three years.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand fell 11.35 points, or 3.5
percent, to 314.24 at midday as investors sold shares in banks and
finance companies, which are struggling to recapitalize after the
government said last week the economy could shrink 5.5 percent this
year.
	   The baht slid past 41 to the U.S. dollar for the first time
since March 18. The dollar had strengthened to 41.25 baht by
midday, up from 40.33 at the close Friday.
	   The Thai government revised its recession estimates downward
last week under its latest talks with the International Monetary
Fund on the dlrs 17.2 billion IMF-managed economic rescue package
for the country.
	   Among conditions Thailand is supposed to meet for IMF help is to
keep inflation at an average of 10.5 percent this year, but some
analysts predict the average is likely to be 12 percent.
	   The Commerce Ministry released figures Monday showing that
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, marking the
biggest increase in more than three years.
	   Inflation has been rising since July 1997, when Thailand
abandoned its fixed-exchange rate system after foreign reserves
were drained in a futile defense of the baht.
	   The weakness in the economy revealed by the de facto devaluation
sparked a chain reaction of economic meltdowns across Asia.

Kaunda freed as state withdraws coup allegations

Eds: COMBINES urgent series, ADDS byline
By ANGUS SHAW
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda was freed
by a court Monday after spending five months under house arrest for
allegedly knowing about plans for coup by junior military officers
last year.
	   Kaunda, 74, waved to supporters on the steps of the Lusaka High
Court after state prosecutors dropped the case against him,
apparently on lack of evidence.
	   Also freed by Judge Japhet Banda was Moyce Kaulungombe, a senior
bodyguard of Kaunda, 74. Both men were charged with concealing
prior knowledge of an Oct. 28 coup attempt by junior military
officers that was quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale told Banda the state entered
a plea of ``nolle prosequi,'' the legal term for ``no
prosecution,'' a procedure normally used when the state lacks
sufficient evidence or does not wish to proceed with its case.
	   ``This means the state doesn't wish to proceed further. You are
discharged so you are free men,'' Banda told Kaunda and his
bodyguard.
	   Kaunda, wearing a long white beard grown since his arrest on
Christmas, was mobbed by hundreds of cheering supporters outside
the court before being driven off to an unspecified destination.
	   The drama came on the first day of the trials of 81 suspects _
most of them soldiers _ who were arrested after junior officers
stormed the state broadcast center and claimed to have overthrown
the government of President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Kaunda repeatedly denied charges against him that carry a
penalty of possible life imprisonment. Most of the other suspects
are charged with treason and face the death sentence.
	   Kaunda, head of an 11-party opposition alliance, was out of the
country during the coup attempt and accused the government of using
it to crush political enemies.
	   Kaunda led Zambia to independence from British rule in 1964 and
held presidential office for 27 years until he was ousted by
Chiluba in the first democratic elections in 1991.
	   He briefly quit public life after that poll but staged a come
back he said was at the request of his supporters.
	   His outspoken attacks angered the government. In 1995, he was
arrested twice this year for addressing unauthorized political
meetings and ruling party lawmakers passed a constitutional
amendment disqaulifying him from running again for presidential
office on grounds his parents were born in neighboring Malawi.

Markets plunge as Taiwan fears impact of Asian crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Currency and share prices both fell
sharply on Monday as investors worried that Asia's financial crisis
will have a widening impact on Taiwan.
	   The Taiwan dollar fell 24.1 cents to 34.23 to one U.S. dollar.
That is the lowest point in almost five months and a 20 percent
plunge since the Asian crisis began last summer.
	   Traders said the Central Bank spent between U.S. dlrs 70 million
and dlrs 80 million to support the local currency and prevent its
free fall.
	   But selling pressure was heavy. Foreign stock funds bought huge
amounts of U.S. dollars after they sold shares in the stock market,
one dealer at a European bank said.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell
297.09 points, or 3.75 percent, to close at 7,606.25. It was the
stock market's worst tumble this year, following declines last week
as investors bailed out because of worries over the local
currency's depreciation.
	   Traders also attributed the market's plunge to concerns over the
slowdown in the economy, citing a 4.56 percent fall in export
orders in April.
	   Taiwan has so far escaped the Asian financial crisis largely
unscathed. Economic growth has been sustained by increased spending
on infrastructure projects despite a 5.6 percent fall in exports in
the first three months this year.
	   But business people are concerned exports could drop further
because of economic troubles in Hong Kong and Japan, Taiwan's two
major trading partners.
	   ``The impact on the stock market is largely psychological,''
dealer Yeh Shun-tai said. ``But it is very likely that Taiwan's
industries and property markets could feel the brunt sooner or
later.''

Center-right rebuffs leaders rebuff more talk on Italian reform 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Leaders of the center-right opposition headed by
media mogul Silvio Berlusconi have rebuffed calls to put off a key
parliamentary vote on political reform, state radio reported
Monday.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition has made the
reforms a major goal of the two-year-old government, and some
parliamentary leaders last week raised the prospect of early
elections if 17 months of legislative efforts to change the system
yield nothing.
	   RAI radio said Gianfranco Fini, a right-wing leader and
Berlusconi's main ally in the opposition Freedom Alliance, turned
down a proposal from Franco Marini, an ex-Christian Democrat within
the alliance, to postpone the vote, which is set for Tuesday in the
Camera of Deputies.
	   Marini had suggested putting off the vote for a while so
politicians could search for a compromise.
	   The process stalled over a demand by Berlusconi, a former
conservative premier, that the figure of the president be granted
power to dissolve Parliament at any time, not just when the premier
resigns.
	   Under the draft of proposals presented to Parliament by a
70-member multiparty committee, the president would be directly
elected instead of chosen by Parliament, as is the case now.
	   Italy's leftist parties strongly oppose increased presidential
powers.
	   After the downfall of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, writers
of the new constitution purposely created a weak central executive.
	   The reform committee also drew up plans to reshape the
legislature, grant more regional autonomy and create a greater
division between judges and prosecutors.

Japan's currency reserves bounce back in May after April dip 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A month after Japan's foreign currency supply
dipped due to intervention in support of the battered yen, the
Japanese Finance Ministry said Monday that the nation's exchange
reserves rose by dlrs 1.22 billion in May.
	   Japan's reserves totaled dlrs 206.98 billion last month, the
ministry said, giving it the world's largest supply of foreign
currency.
	   The increase comes after reserves in April declined by dlrs
17.84 billion compared to the previous month.
	   Supplies fell that month as the Bank of Japan waged an
aggressive campaign to prop up the weakening Japanese currency by
selling dollars and buying yen.

Strong earthquake strikes Russian Far East; no injuries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A strong earthquake struck Russia's Far Eastern
Kamchatka peninsula on Monday, emergency officials said. There were
no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which measured at magnitude 6.3, struck at 5:40 p.m.
local time (0540 GMT) was centered 100 kilometers (60 miles)
southeast of the region's capital of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, said
Vasily Yurchuk, spokesman for Russia's Emergencies Ministry. The
epicenter was below the Pacific Ocean, at a depth of 25 kilometers
(16 miles).
	   The peninsula, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, is more than
7,000 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow.
	   Monday's quake followed eight temblors that struck the same
region on May 28, registering a high as magnitude 7, Yurchuk said.

Militant labor group likely to cancel nationwide strike consultative body, CORRECTS president's visit to June 6-14 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with mainstream labor group's decision to join
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bowing to public pressure, South
Korea's militant workers appeared ready Monday to withdraw their
strike threats and negotiate their differences with the government.
	   Reversing its previous stance, the Federation of Korean Trade
Unions said it will join a government-proposed consultative
committee to discuss ways to salvage South Korea's battered
economy.
	   The federation claims 1.5 million members in white-collar and
small-business jobs.
	   Meanwhile, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a smaller
but more militant labor group, indicated it may call off a
nationwide strike scheduled for next week during President Kim
Dae-jung's visit to the United States.
	   The confederation, which claims a membership of 500,000 in auto,
shipbuilding and other heavy industries, had planned to cap a
recent series of labor strikes and protests with a large-scale
strike on June 10 to protest growing layoffs.
	   ``A much feared government-labor confrontation may be averted,''
the all-news cable television network, Yonhap TV, reported.
	   The government has been trying to lure union leaders into a
consultative body of representatives from the government, labor and
management to resolve labor problems through dialogue.
	   A similar body, formed in January, succeeded in adopting a pact
that made layoffs easier, a major concession by workers accustomed
to lifetime employment during South Korea's boom years.
	   But labor leaders later accused the government and management of
laying off workers en masse while dragging their feet on
implementing promised benefits to the unions.
	   Critics warned that a new strike could hurt efforts by President
Kim to attract foreign investment during his June 6-14 visit to the
United States.
	   ``We intend to fully cooperate (with the government) so that
President Kim Dae-jung's state visit to the United States will be
successful,'' a statement from the confederation said.
	   The confederation said it already has formed a high-ranking
negotiating team and urged the government to ``appear at the
negotiation table and make serious efforts to resolve pending
problems.''
	   A confederation official, requesting anonymity, said it was
possible that the strike could be canceled or delayed, depending on
``the attitude of the government.''
	   Officials at the Labor Ministry refused to discuss details but
acknowledged that both sides have been meeting to break the
stalemate.
	   State KBS-TV reported that the government has made fresh
promises to minimize layoffs, significantly increase unemployment
benefits and accelerate restructuring of South Korea's bloated,
family-oriented conglomerates, or chaebol _ key demands of labor
unions.
	   Thousands of workers clashed with riot police on May Day,
resulting in dozens of people injured. Protest rallies and street
demonstrations have since become almost a daily event.
	   Prosecutors are pushing criminal charges against more than 100
labor leaders for alleged involvement in a two-day strike by
autoworkers and other laborers last week.
	   Government figures show that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and may top 2 million by the end of
this year.

Mir computer failure threatens U.S. shuttle launch successfully running first tests, UPGRADES attribution. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with crew trying again to restart computer,
AP Photos planned
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After running smoothly for months, Mir's skittish
central computer was out of order for a third day Monday,
threatening to postpone the Russian space station's last rendezvous
with a U.S. shuttle.
	   U.S. space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday
and dock with the station on Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew
Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on the Russian
outpost.
	   But that trip to the Mir is now in doubt since the shuttle can
only dock if the station's computer-controlled steering system
properly aligns it for the docking.
	   ``We hope that the crew will finally resolve the problem later
today,'' said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian Mission
Control.
	   He said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   ``They still have a lot of spares to fix the problem,'' Lyndin
told The Associated Press.
	   The crew resumed attempts to restart the computer later on
Monday and were running the first tests successfully. They will try
to put it back on line in the next few hours, Lyndin said.
	   During a chat with ground controllers, Musabayev said the
situation on board ``isn't bad'' but added that he was concerned
that it occurred on the eve of the shuttle's launch. ``I'm worried
not for myself, but for the flight program,'' he said.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a shuttle ferry flight
in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months of
trouble-free operation. The station's crew has replaced it with a
back-up computer brought up by a Russian cargo ship.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply is
threatened because it can't keep its solar panels in optimum
alignment with the sun.
	   Depending on how much energy was lost, it can take from one to
three days to get the orientation system fully on-line.
	   Fortunately, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was
on the so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight
round the clock. As a result, the Mir's solar panels have remained
in full sunlight.
	   The crew also shut down some systems to save energy, and as a
result Mir's batteries were full on Monday, which will make it
easier for the crew to restore the orientation system, Lyndin said.

China reports smuggling by sea up 81 percent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Smuggling autos, cashmere and other commodities
by sea in China increased 81 percent in the first quarter of the
year compared with the same period last year, state news media
reported Monday.
	   Chemicals, oil, autos and spare parts, cashmere, edible oil,
steel and computers were the main items smuggled, the government's
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   By sneaking goods into China, smugglers hope to avoid paying
import tariffs and thus to pocket larger profits.
	   The report quoted Outlook, a state-run magazine, as saying 1,229
smuggling cases were uncovered in the first quarter of the year,
mostly in the south. It did not give a reason for the increase.
	   Most of the seizures were in the southern province of Guangdong;
Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, west of Guangdong; Haikou, the capital of
the southern island province of Hainan; Xiamen, Quanzhou and
Fuzhou, cities in southeastern China's Fuzhou province. Another
major smuggling point was Dalian in northeastern China's Liaoning
province.
	   China plans a national meeting about fighting smuggling in June,
Outlook reported.

Taiwan spy chief warns of Chinese invasion capability 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Redeployment and renewal have made China's
forces capable of invading Taiwan, and its military is devoted to
training for the task, Taiwan's spy chief said Monday.
	   New weapons and advances in electronic warfare have vastly
increased the threat to Taiwan from China's military, Yin
Tsung-wen, director of the National Security Bureau, said in a rare
public appearance.
	   Meanwhile, the reduction of other defense concerns has allowed
the People's Liberation Army to train exclusively for an invasion
of Taiwan, Yin told an audience of university students in a pitch
for new recruits.
	   Yin's comments reflect the seriousness with which Taiwan's
leaders view the military threat from China, and their
determination to keep the public focused on defense.
	   Two years of military service are required of all Taiwanese
males, but the services have difficulty recruiting professional
soldiers. The government also has difficulty persuading the public
to remain vigilant. Business clamors for closer economic links with
China.
	   China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, and threatens to invade if
the island declares formal independence. Taiwan was ruled for 50
years as a Japanese colony until 1945, and split from China again
in 1949 at the end of the Chinese civil war.
	   Most foreign observers discount China's ability to launch a
full-blown invasion, citing deficiencies in its air and sea lift
capacities. Taiwan also has its own formidable defenses.
	   But officials here refer to the Chinese threat in dire terms. A
Defense Ministry white paper issued in March warned China is now
capable of at least a partial blockade of Taiwan, and said China's
missiles could cripple its military and civil institutions.
	   Yin said a Chinese invasion would begin with an electronic
assault on Taiwan's communications and financial networks, followed
by missile attacks, a fight for control of airspace and coastal
seas, and finally a ground invasion.
	   The Soviet Union's breakup allowed China to move forces
stationed on its northern border into coastal provinces opposite
Taiwan, Yin said. Missile tests and war games held near Taiwan in
1995-96 were examples of the PLA's single-minded devotion to an
invasion, Yin said.
	   China staged those exercises, which included firing missiles
just 35 kilometers (21 miles) from Taiwan's coast, in an attempt to
intimidate those advocating the island's independence.
	   Yin said the major intelligence threat to Taiwan came not from
Beijing's spies here, who he said number less than 100, but from
Taiwanese who visit China. His bureau has stepped up surveillance
of Taiwanese suspected of funneling military and technological
secrets to China, he said.

South Korean exports decrease for first time in four months 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Exports, the engine of South Korea's
economy, decreased slightly in May for the first time in four
months, dimming hopes for a fast economic recovery.
	   Exports in May dropped by 2.6 percent to dlrs 11.4 billion from
the same month last year, the first monthly drop since January, the
Ministry of Industry and Energy said Monday.
	   Imports in May also fell 37.5 percent to dlrs 7.7 billion from a
year ago, mainly because of depressed domestic consumption and
facility investment and falling oil prices.
	   That created a dlrs 3.7 billion trade surplus in May, the
seventh straight monthly gain, and pushed South Korea's total trade
surplus so far this year to dlrs 16.1 billion.
	   But analysts said the continuing trade surplus is unhealthy
because it results from sharply decreasing imports rather than
increased exports, which have led the country's economic expansion.
	   Officials attributed the decreased May exports to the financial
difficulties in Asia, where many currencies were sharply devaluated
in recent months.
	   Asian countries have traditionally consumed about half of South
Korean exports. But Korean exports to the region fell by 10 percent
between January and April.
	   ``I believe the incentives of the weak Korean won, or price
competitiveness of Korean products by currency devaluation, are
already gone,'' said Lee Pil-sang, an economics professor at Korea
University.
	   The Korean won has lost nearly half of its value since late
1996. But other Asian currencies were also devaluated, ranging
between 16 percent for Japan and 80 percent for Indonesia.
	   The weak currencies, especially the Japanese yen, hurt Korean
exports in the international markets as the nation's key exports
such as semiconductor, steel, ships, and home appliances compete
with Japanese exports.
	   Lee also said that the decreasing South Korean imports of raw
materials could affect future South Korean exports.
	   ``Fewer imports of raw materials now means fewer exports in the
future. The impact has been little so far, but it will be bigger
and bigger,'' Lee said. ``Considering all, the prospect for our
exports in coming months is quite gloomy.''
	   South Korea began to post trade surpluses in November when the
surplus reached dlrs 120 million. It reported a record trade
surplus of dlrs 3.91 billion in April.
	   The nation recorded a trade deficit of dlrs 528 million in May,
last year. The total 1997 trade deficit reached dlrs 8.5 billion.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to bail out an economy on the verge of collapse under the
weight of over dlrs 150 billion in foreign debts.

EDS: UPDATES with closing figures for all Asian markets
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Most Asian markets tumbled Monday, pushed down
by rising fears of a recession and falling regional currencies.
	   In Taiwan, the key index fell 3.8 percent as investors feared
Asia's financial crisis will have a widening impact on the island's
economy.
	   Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar fell 24.1 cents to 34.23 against
the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan currency has lost 20 percent of its
value since the regional economic crisis began last summer.
	   In Thailand, both shares prices and the currency slumped.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 12.55 points, or 3.8
percent, to 313.04, a new low for the year.
	   The Thai baht slid past 41 to the U.S. dollar for the first time
since March 18. The dollar had strengthened to 41.25 baht by
midday, up from 40.33 at the close Friday.
	   According to the latest government inflation figures, Thailand
is suffering the stiffest price hikes in three years.
	   Malaysian shares closed sharply lower, with the key index
falling 3.76 percent on the back of a weak currency.
	   The Kuala Lumpur stock Exchange's Composite Index closed at
518.00 points, down 20.24 points.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 3.9275 ringgit,
compared to 3.8739 late Friday.
	   The Weighted Stock Price Index slumped 297.09 points to close at
7,606.25.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 322.55 points, or 3.6
percent, to close at 8,612.01.
	   Investors were concerned over the government's announcement late
Friday that the Hong Kong economy contracted 2 percent in the first
quarter, brokers said.
	   The contraction was the first in 13 years.
	   Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy triggered a
2.23 percent decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index on
Monday and drove the U.S. dollar higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 349.75 points,
closing at 15,321.03 points. On Friday, the index had shed 125.77
points, or 0.80 percent.
	   In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 139.12 yen, up 0.40
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 138.90 yen Friday. The dollar rose as high as 139.33 yen,
a level not seen since early July 1991.
	   On Friday, the government said Japan's jobless rate hit a record
4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in March.
	   The market was closed in New Zealand for a holiday.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on worries over the
Indonesian economy. The JSX Composite Index fell 1.5 percent, or
6.386 points, to 414.079.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed lower for the seventh
straight session, with foreign investors remaining sidelined due to
political and economic concerns in Asia. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks fell 15.40 points, or 0.7
percent, to 1,996.05.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower in sluggish trading
on renewed investor nervousness over Asian markets. The All
Ordinaries Index fell 26.6 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,689.1.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher as worries about labor unrest
in the country eased. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose
4.67 points, or 1.4 percent, to 336.70.

Cabinet meeting ends without decision on West Bank withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite growing U.S. pressure on Israel to make
a decision, Israel's Cabinet on Monday again failed to reach
agreement on the the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israel's continued indecision is likely to further strain ties
with the United States which reportedly has demanded an Israeli
answer within several days to its proposal for a pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   However, U.S. ultimatums to Israel have come and gone in the
past month without repercussions for Israel, and it appeared Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was more concerned about the survival
of his government than about possible U.S. censure.
	   A U.S. official said Monday he did not expect the Clinton
administration to make good on veiled threats to announce the
failure of the U.S. peace initiative and blame Israel. Instead,
Washington will give Israel more time to reach a decision, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Far-right Cabinet ministers have threatened to topple the
government if Netanyahu agreed to a 13 percent pullback.
	   ``A 13 percent withdrawal would be a disaster for Jewish
settlements,'' Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom from the National
Religious Party told Israel radio Monday. ``We cannot agree. We
were assured by the prime minister that there would be no troop
redeployment that will hurt the settlements.''
	   The Jewish Settlers' Council on Monday launched a campaign to
turn Israeli public opinion against a 13 percent troop pullback.
Recent polls have suggested that a large majority in Israel want
Netanyahu to forge ahead with the peace negotiations and agree to a
troop withdrawal. In the settlers' campaign, brochures were mailed
to 1 million homes in Israel, with maps illustrating the settlers'
arguments that a pullback would endanger water resources, Israeli
security and control over Jewish holy sites.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been trying for
months to break the deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians on
the pullback. The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal for
an immediate 13 percent pullback, to be followed by another
significant withdrawal whose scope has not been determined.
	   Israel radio and the Maariv daily reported Monday that Netanyahu
was considering a 15 percent pullback in three stages. Netanyahu's
adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately available for
comment, but the radio said Netanyahu denied the report.
	   On Monday morning, Netanyahu first met with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon, and
the three failed to reach agreement on a troop pullback, Israel
radio said. Sharon, a former defense minister, insists that handing
over more than 9 percent would endanger Israel's security.
	   Mordechai told the daily the Yediot Ahronot daily before the
meetingt that ``the time has come to make decisions on everything
connected to the peace talks and the Palestinians.''
	   After consulting with his ``kitchen Cabinet,'' Netanyahu
convened all of the ministers to discuss the pullback. The
two-and-a-half hour meeting produced no result.

Miner dies, two others injured in Ukraine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One miner died and two others were injured
when a layer of rock collapsed in a coal mine in the eastern
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials said Monday.
	   The accident occurred at the Korotchenko mine on Sunday, and the
wounded were hospitalized, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Mine officials have launched an investigation into the accident.
	   The death brought to more than 165 the number of miners killed
on the job this year and highlighted the crisis in the Ukrainian
mining industry, which is suffering from poor work conditions and
lack of funding.
	   Dozens of mines were idled by scattered strikes last month as
workers demanded payment of back wages, salary hikes and more state
support for the struggling industry.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is unlikely to slip into a
recession this year despite a trend toward negative growth in
Southeast Asia, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament on
Monday, but the markets were unconvinced.
	   ``The overall picture of the Singapore economy is one of
uncertainty,'' Hu told Parliament. But he stood by an earlier
government forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in economic
growth this year.
	   Meanwhile, the government minister who heads the national trade
unions said layoffs this year would exceed the peak of 20,000 who
lost their jobs during the 1985-86 recession.
	   Some private analysts and economists have forecast Singapore's
economy slowing this year to about 1.5 percent GDP growth. Three
major international investment houses have predicted recession.
	   Singapore's already bearish market fell on the recession
jitters, with the benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index falling
1.6 percent to close at 1,234.57 points. Also, Singapore's currency
fell against the U.S. dollar to 1.69 in late trading.
	   Dealers said Hu's assurances that Singapore won't slip into a
recession this year run counter to growing pessimism among some
private economists and fears of recession elsewhere in the region.
He failed to calm market nerves.
	   ``Because we do a lot of trade with our neighbors, demand drops,
and I think if the second half of this year is worse, some
companies will have to trim costs by cutting down the work force,''
Lim Boon Heng, who is secretary-general of the National Trade
Unions Congress and also a minister without portfolio in the
government, said Sunday. he predicted record unemployment by the
end of the year.
	   Finance Minister Hu said off-budget measures to stimulate the
economy would be decided on in late June or July.
	   ``As the Singapore economy is fairly well diversified, we are
unlikely to slip into negative growth this year as our growth will
be supported by the relatively healthy performance in the U.S. and
(European Union) economies,'' Hu said.
	   But he indicated that signs of a contraction might necessitate
special economic measures ``sooner rather than later.''
	   ``We will not wait for GDP growth to go negative before we do
something,'' Hu said. ``If the trend is clearly going to head in
that direction we will try to do something.''
	   Hu said that once the May figures are available in mid-June, the
government would have a clearer picture of second-quarter economic
developments and could react with tax cuts or rebates.
	   ``We would like to look at the May figures before we react,'' Hu
said in response to questions from members of parliament over
whether the government was responding quickly enough. ``Certainly
its not too long to wait for a few weeks.''
	   The finance minister also warned preliminary data showed non-oil
domestic exports dropping by 6 percent in May.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that
Singapore is still offering up to dlrs 5 billion in financing of
Indonesian trade through Singapore, despite the abrupt change in
government in Jakarta.
	   Lee told Parliament that the money, which is supplemental to a
rescue plan put together by the International Monetary Fund,
wouldn't be released until IMF funding is reinstated.

Passengers stranded as Air France strike begins 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Passengers were stranded Monday at airports across
France after Air France pilots began a strike that threatened to
disrupt travel plans during the World Cup soccer games.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: ``annule,'' _ canceled _ written in red next to almost
all international and domestic flights.
	   The strike began at midnight after Air France failed to reach an
agreement with pilots seeking to block wage cuts.
	   Air France set up special telephone lines for passengers seeking
information on flights. There was no immediate indication of how
many flights were canceled or which routes were most affected.
	   Most of the company's aircraft _ many of them decorated with
players representing the 32 World Cup teams _ remained grounded
Monday. Air France is the official carrier for the World Cup.
	   The World Cup, held every four years, will attract an estimated
one million people to France. The tournament kicks off June 10. A
combined audience of 40 billion is expected to view the four-week
soccer bonanza.
	   Air France expects to cancel 90 percent of long-haul flights for
the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and medium-haul flights
out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are likely to fly as
planned, the company has said, as are about 20 percent leaving from
Orly airport.
	   The spokesman for the leading union in the strike, the SNPL,
apologized to customers.
	   ``We have no other choice,'' Christian Paris said on France Info
radio on Sunday.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   Sarre, speaking Sunday on French television, said the pilots
were ``practicing blackmail on the company.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday. Most of the state-run carrier's 3,200 pilots were likely
to take part.
	   The pilots are asking the carrier to abandon a plan to save dlrs
83 million a year by cutting into their salaries, currently among
the highest in their field in the world. The cost-saving measure
also calls for pilots hired after June 1997 to begin at a lower
salary than their predecessors did.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta sees the plan as
critical to keeping the airline profitable. Air France reported
strong 1997 earnings after years of crippling debts.

Devastating heat wave starts ebbing in India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The severe heat began abating Monday in
northern India after killing a reported 800 people across the
country last month.
	   Light showers and dust storms on Sunday brought some relief to
people in parts of Jammu-Kashmir state and New Delhi.
Meteorologists said the day temperatures were unlikely to rise any
further.
	   Temperatures on Sunday hovered between 108-120 degrees (42-49
degrees Celsius) in several parts of the country.
	   The first monsoon showers were expected to hit the southern
state of Kerala on Monday. Pre-monsoon thundershowers were expected
to cool some northern regions on Monday or early Tuesday, according
to the New Delhi weather office.
	   In the western desert province of Rajasthan and the northern
states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, this
year's summer has been the hottest in three years. The highest
temperature of the season _ 120 degrees (49 degrees Celsius) _ was
recorded in Rajasthan nearly two weeks ago.
	   Local news agencies put the heat-related death toll over the
last month at least 800. A meteorologist argued the blistering
summer was not all that unusual.
	   ``The normal temperature this time of the year was 44 Celsius
(111 Fahrenheit) and a five degrees rise on a few occasions is not
wholly unexpected,'' United News of India news agency quoted D.S.
Desai as saying.
	   Indians had to bear with frequent power outages and insufficient
drinking water in most cities and towns. Protester came out on the
streets and burned police vehicles in New Delhi.
	   The upper house of Parliament decided Monday to discuss next
week the shortage of power and drinking water after some members
complained that parts of the federal capital have been without
power for days.
	   Hospitals overflowed with victims of heat stroke, dehydration
and flu in various parts of the country, officials said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens read ``canceled'' in bright red
letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine days before the
soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 World Cup teams, sat
idle at terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts
aimed at keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of
the red.
	   It was a serious embarrassment to the leftist government of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and train workers were also
threatening to strike later in the week.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   Air France assured that it would make good on its commitment to
fly World Cup teams.
	   But the airline expected to cancel 90 percent of long-haul
flights for the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are
likely to fly as planned, the company has said, as are about 20
percent leaving from Orly airport, in south Paris.
	   In contrast to past conflicts when ground crews blocked airport
runways, the pilots kept a low profile and simply didn't show up
for work. Other airlines quietly went on with their flights.
	   The spokesman for the leading union in the strike, the SNPL,
apologized to customers. ``We have no other choice,'' Christian
Paris said on France Info radio on Sunday.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday.
	   On Thursday, French industry will slow, with the CGT union
calling for a strike which is expected to affect most public
services, as well as the energy and construction sectors.

German, Iranian foreign minister to meet June 10 in New York 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The German foreign minister and his Iranian
counterpart are to meet June 10 at a U.N. gathering in New York in
efforts to improve relations between their two countries, the
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   The meeting is the latest sign of European interest in resuming
full ties with Tehran since moderate Mohammad Khatami was elected
as Iran's president last summer.
	   Germany's Klaus Kinkel and Iran's Kamal Kharrazi also had a
``detailed'' telephone conversation late Sunday on bilateral
relations, the ministry said, declining to provide details. The two
ministers also spoke about the Pakistani and Indian nuclear tests
ahead of Kharrazi's trip this week to Pakistan, the ministry said.
	   Two German envoys traveled to Teheran May 11-12 in what was
believed to be the first visit there by foreign ministry officials
in 2 1/2 years.
	   In addition to diplomatic relations, they discussed the case of
German businessman Helmut Hofer. He was sentenced to death in
January under Islamic law for having sex with a 26-year-old medical
student, because she was Muslim and he was not. He has appealed the
sentence, claiming he converted to Islam several years ago.
	   Kinkel has said that executing Hofer would damage relations with
Iran.
	   An appeals court in Teheran last month sent the case back to the
original court. Foreign Ministry officials have said it is not
clear what effect that development would have on Hofer's appeal.
	   Iran's relations with the European Union are recovering from
last year's strains over a German court ruling that implicated
Tehran's highest rulers in the 1992 assassination of an
Iranian-Kurdish opposition figure at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.
	   The verdict led the European Union to suspend its ``critical
dialogue'' policy of maintaining contacts with Iran, and all EU
countries except Greece recalled their ambassadors from Tehran.
	   A diplomatic thaw began late last year with the return of the
ambassadors.

Most Asian stock markets close sharply lower

EDS: ADDS Singapore closing figures
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Most Asian markets tumbled Monday, pushed down
by rising fears of a recession and falling regional currencies.
	   In Taiwan, the key index fell 3.8 percent as investors feared
Asia's financial crisis will have a widening impact on the island's
economy.
	   Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar fell 24.1 cents to 34.23 against
the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan currency has lost 20 percent of its
value since the regional economic crisis began last summer.
	   In Thailand, both shares prices and the currency slumped.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 12.55 points, or 3.8
percent, to 313.04, a new low for the year.
	   The Thai baht slid past 41 to the U.S. dollar for the first time
since March 18. The dollar had strengthened to 41.25 baht by
midday, up from 40.33 at the close Friday.
	   According to the latest government inflation figures, Thailand
is suffering the stiffest price hikes in three years.
	   Malaysian shares closed sharply lower, with the key index
falling 3.76 percent on the back of a weak currency.
	   The Kuala Lumpur stock Exchange's Composite Index closed at
518.00 points, down 20.24 points.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 3.9275 ringgit,
compared to 3.8739 late Friday.
	   The Weighted Stock Price Index slumped 297.09 points to close at
7,606.25.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 322.55 points, or 3.6
percent, to close at 8,612.01.
	   Investors were concerned over the government's announcement late
Friday that the Hong Kong economy contracted 2 percent in the first
quarter, brokers said.
	   The contraction in the first quarter was the first in 13 years.
	   Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy triggered a
2.23 percent decline in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index on
Monday and drove the U.S. dollar higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 349.75 points,
closing at 15,321.03 points. On Friday, the index had shed 125.77
points, or 0.80 percent.
	   In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 139.12 yen, up 0.40
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 138.90 yen Friday. The dollar rose as high as 139.33 yen,
a level not seen since early July 1991.
	   On Friday, the government said Japan's jobless rate hit a record
4.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in March.
	   The market was closed in New Zealand for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower in line with regional
markets. The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index closed down
20.34 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,234.59.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on worries over the
Indonesian economy. The JSX Composite Index fell 1.5 percent, or
6.386 points, to 414.079.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed lower for the seventh
straight session, with foreign investors remaining sidelined due to
political and economic concerns in Asia. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks fell 15.40 points, or 0.7
percent, to 1,996.05.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower in sluggish trading
on renewed investor nervousness over Asian markets. The All
Ordinaries Index fell 26.6 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,689.1.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher as worries about labor unrest
in the country eased. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose
4.67 points, or 1.4 percent, to 336.70.

Defense ministry: 500 rebels surrender in Congo's east 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ As many as 500 ethnic Mai-Mai rebels have
surrendered in northeastern Congo after a series of government
military operations against their bases, the Ministry of Defense
confirmed Monday.
	   The mass surrender follows a series of government military
operations to clear out the Mai-Mai rebels and their allies from
the area around the town of Goma, near the Rwandan border.
	   ``We launched these operations along the border between the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda,'' said Maj. Ande Kanou, a
commander with Kabila's forces in Goma. ``The results you will see
are the young Mai-Mai who came out.''
	   After toppling the late dictator Mobutu Sese-Seko and coming to
power a year ago this month, Kabila has been struggling to quell
growing unrest among the Mai-Mai rebel forces in eastern Congo _
formerly Zaire.
	   State-run television over the weekend said the Mai-Mai had been
used for cover by military operatives from Rwanda, but did not
elaborate.
	   The Mai-Mai reportedly draw strength from the former Rwandan
Armed Forces along with support from militia groups elsewhere in
Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
	   The Mai-Mai, whose name in Swahili means `magic water,' are made
up of fighters from tribes in eastern Congo who joined the Kabila
rebel alliance that ousted Mobutu.
	   They subsequently turned against Kabila, mainly in protest
against the presence of ethnic Tutsis from neighboring Rwanda and
eastern Congo in the new army and local administration.
	   Tutsi fighters from Rwanda played an important role in Kabila's
rebel war last year, but also stand accused of widespread massacres
against Rwandan Hutu refugees in Congo.
	   Kanou said Congolese forces had launched several attacks on
camps in North Kivu province used by the Mai-Mai and their allies
along the border with Rwanda. Few details of the operations were
made available.
	   Security in eastern Congo has been steadily deteriorating with
reports of Mai-Mai fighters joining other disgruntled groups in
staging sporadic attacks against road convoys and populated areas.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ As Pakistan and India took turns
touting their respective nuclear programs and belittling each

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aircraft loaded with emergency aid
left Pakistan on Monday for remote northern Afghanistan, where
soldiers dug through the rubble of villages leveled by a powerful
earthquake in search of buried victims.
	   The quake, which hit Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of
6.9, flattened entire villages, sliced mountains and triggered
landslides. Thousands are feared dead.
	   ``We saw a couple of villages that had been completely
flattened, but there were probably more,'' said Alfredo
Witschi-Cestari, head of the U.N. humanitarian aid office in
neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``This is a mountainous region and the force of the earthquake
sent houses crashing down the hillsides toward the valleys below,''
he said after visiting the site Sunday.
	   While initial estimates are putting the death toll at 3,000, aid
workers and local officials in the area expect it may rise to
5,000.
	   Among those killed were 140 schoolchildren in Rostaq, the site
of a Feb. 4 earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left
another 8,000 homeless.
	   Many of the people affected were living in tents because they
lost their homes in the February quake.
	   Cargo aircraft in neighboring Pakistan, packed with emergency
supplies, were expected to reach the region later in the day, aid
workers said.
	   Tons of food, blankets, tents and plastic sheeting also were to
be loaded onto cargo helicopters Monday in the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad to be sent to Faisabad. From there, the supplies will be
forwarded to the areas that suffered the greatest damage.
	   The French Foreign Ministry also plans to send about 35 tons of
humanitarian aid to Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where it will be
transported to the disaster area.
	   The international Red Cross got one plane into Faisabad on
Sunday and was preparing to set up a clinic in the area.
	   ``We need help desperately. Thousands of people are dead,'' a
spokesman for a northern alliance fighting Afghanistan's Taliban
government said from the stricken area, near the border with
Tajikistan.
	   Opposition soldiers already had recovered 1,650 bodies, Shamshul
Haq Arianfar said. Speaking from Chaib, the alliance spokesman said
eight villages simply disintegrated.
	   U.N. officials flew over some of the most desolate and
hardest-hit regions Sunday, setting down briefly near the quake's
epicenter in Shari Basurkh, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the
Badakhshan provincial capital of Faisabad.
	   They delivered tents, plastic sheeting, and materials for an
emergency clinic to be set up in Shari Basurkh for the many
wounded. The officials said 4,100 houses were destroyed.
	   The area's sun-baked mud homes, already weakened by the February
temblor, crumbled like dry dust in Saturday's violent shaking. The
homes were more vulnerable by the relentless rain that battered the
region in recent days.
	   Aid organization officials in neighboring Tajikistan were told
by the Afghan ambassador that 5,000 people were killed. The Red
Cross said it was not able to confirm the figure.
	   According to the report, the dead included 3,000 killed in Shari
Basurkh, almost 1,900 in a settlement on the outskirts of Faisabad,
the 140 schoolchildren in Rostaq and 124 people in Chaib, on
Afghanistan's border with Tajikistan.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens read ``canceled'' in bright red
letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine days before the
soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 World Cup teams, sat
idle at terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts
aimed at keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of
the red.
	   It was a serious embarrassment to the leftist government of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and train workers were also
threatening to strike later in the week.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   Air France assured that it would make good on its commitment to
fly World Cup teams.
	   But the airline expected to cancel 90 percent of long-haul
flights for the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are
likely to fly as planned, the company has said, as are about 20
percent leaving from Orly airport, in south Paris.
	   In contrast to past conflicts when ground crews blocked airport
runways, the pilots kept a low profile and simply didn't show up
for work. Other airlines quietly went on with their flights.
	   The spokesman for the leading union in the strike, the SNPL,
apologized to customers. ``We have no other choice,'' Christian
Paris said on France Info radio on Sunday.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday.
	   On Thursday, French industry will slow, with the CGT union
calling for a strike which is expected to affect most public
services, as well as the energy and construction sectors.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The number of telephone lines in the
Asia-Pacific region grew by a whopping 27 percent, making it the
fastest growing telephone market in the world, according to a
leading telecommunications expert.
	   Still, the Asia-Pacific region only accounts for 20 percent of
the world's telephone lines, though 53 percent of the world
population lives in this region, said Deputy Secretary-General of
the International Telecommunications Union Henry Chasia.
	   Chasia spoke at Monday's opening of the CommunicAsia
98/NetworkAsia98, a massive trade show with the latest telephone,
computer and broadcast technology on display. The annual show is
Singapore's second largest trade fair.
	   ``In 1997 teledensity was two times that of any other region,''
he said, adding that the cellular phone market had also grown by 70
percent.
	   ``This community is fighting back with new and innovative
changes that have been made possible by digital technology,'' he
said. ``This technology allows for the expansion in voice, data,
facsimile and audio visual technology that has previously been
confined to restrictions and national borders.''
	   The ITU suggests private investors, global organizations and
governments will be responsible to meet the monetary needs of the
expanding Asia-Pacific region.
	   This deregulation process will give the Asia-Pacific region 35
percent of the global wireless market by the year 2000, Chasia
said. By the year 2007, Singapore likely will have 50 percent of
the world pager market since it already has the highest pay-phone
density in the world.
	   Displays at the booths for NetworkAsia, CommunicAsia,
BroadcastAsia, CableSat98 and MobileCommAsia show how the different
communications sectors are increasingly interrelated. The
exhibition, in its 12th year, is attended by 1,800 companies from
46 countries.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stocks and the currency took a
beating Monday on fears of a deepening recession in Asia, while new
inflation figures showed the country is suffering the stiffest
price hikes in three years.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand fell 12.55 points, or nearly 4
percent, to close at The 313.04, as investors sold shares in banks
and finance companies, which are struggling to recapitalize after
the government said the economy could shrink 5.5 percent this year.
	   The baht slid past 41 to the U.S. dollar for the first time
since March 18. The dollar had strengthened to 41.25 baht by
midday, up from 40.33 at the close Friday.
	   The Thai government revised its recession estimates downward
last week under its latest talks with the International Monetary
Fund on the dlrs 17.2 billion IMF-managed economic rescue package
for the country.
	   Among conditions Thailand is supposed to meet for IMF help is to
keep inflation at an average of 10.5 percent this year, but some
analysts predict the average is likely to be 12 percent.
	   The Commerce Ministry released figures Monday showing that
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, marking the
biggest increase in more than three years.
	   Inflation has been rising since July 1997, when Thailand
abandoned its fixed-exchange rate system after foreign reserves
were drained in a futile defense of the baht.
	   The weakness in the economy revealed by the de facto devaluation
sparked a chain reaction of economic meltdowns across Asia.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Most Asian markets tumbled Monday, pushed down
by rising fears of a recession and falling regional currencies. In
Taiwan, the key index fell 3.8 percent as investors feared Asia's
financial crisis will have a widening impact on the island's
economy. Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar fell 24.1 cents to 34.23
against the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan currency has lost 20 percent of
its value since the regional economic crisis began last summer. In
Thailand, both shares prices and the currency slumped. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index fell 12.55 points, or 3.8 percent, to
313.04, a new low for the year. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index
fell 322.55 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 8,612.01. Investors
were concerned over the government's announcement late Friday that
the Hong Kong economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter,
brokers said. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Enlisting reinforcements to battle
Indonesia's most daunting economic crisis in 30 years, new
President B.J. Habibie has named a fresh team of economic advisers,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Monday. The team includes
economist Widjojo Nitisastro, who headed a team of advisers set up
earlier this year by former President Suharto, former Finance
Minister Frans Seda, and Ali Wardhana, also formerly an adviser to
Suharto. Akbar said the new team will advise the president on all
problems affecting the crisis-ridden Indonesian economy and on the
government's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
Their advice will supplement the work of Habibie's economic
ministers, led by Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Industry
and Finance Ginandjar Kartasasmita. Ginandjar and his team met last
week in Jakarta with Hubert Neiss, the IMF's director for Asia and
Pacific Affairs. They predicted the economy will contract by at
least 10 percent this year. (INDONESIA-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nervous markets sank farther in early
trading Monday despite U.S. promises to support new loans by
international lenders. In a brief statement issued Sunday,
President Bill Clinton expressed U.S. support for aid to Russia
from such multinational institutions as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. Nonetheless, by midday the stock
market was down an additional 4.5 percent, although traders said
there was little panic selling. Russian leaders have been working
to stabilize the financial markets after a wave of panic selling
last week caused the stock market to plummet and threatened a run
on the national currency, the ruble. Altogether the stock market is
down 40 percent since April. The Central Bank has intervened to
prop up the ruble and raised interest rates to 150 percent to
convince investors to stay in Russia. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy is unlikely to slip into a
recession this year despite a trend toward negative growth in
Southeast Asia, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament on
Monday, but the market was unconvinced. Meanwhile, the government
minister who heads the national trade unions said layoffs this year
would exceed the 20,000 who lost their jobs during the 1985-86
recessions. ``The overall picture of the Singapore economy is one
of uncertainty,'' Hu told Parliament. But he stood by an earlier
government forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in economic
growth this year. Some private analysts and economists have begun
predicting Singapore's economy would contract this year with a GDP
of no more than 1.5 percent. Three major international investment
houses have predicted recession. (SINGAPORE-ECONOMY)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific rim countries could sign an agreement
this week that would simplify certification of communication
equipment and allow foreign manufacturers greater access to Asia, a
U.S. official said Monday. Communications equipment such as
cellular phones and modems currently must meet technological
standards and be certified in each of the countries where they'll
be used. The Mutual Recognition Agreement would allow manufacturers
to get their equipment certified by agencies in their own
countries, lowering the cost to consumers and getting the products
to market faster, said Larry Irving, assistant secretary of
communications and information at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The United States and the European Union already have a similar
agreement. (ASIA-COMMUNICATIONS)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday denied Pakistani
allegations that it plans to continue the nuclear test tit-for-tat
that has raised tensions in this already volatile region. Foreign
Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was surreptitiously
preparing to conduct more tests next month was ``surprising.''
``India has declared a moratorium on testing and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said. India was
the first to escalate the long-standing Indo-Pakistan rivalry to
the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In response, Pakistan
claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week. Pakistan
has not said whether it would test again. U.S. intelligence sources
said over the weekend they had detected no signs that either
Pakistan or India was readying new tests. (INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's business press fretted Monday
over how the government's new budget would cope with anti-nuclear
sanctions, a widening deficit, rising inflation and a failing
rupee. Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha was to present the budget to
Parliament in a speech Monday evening. His government has promised
to revive India's economic growth, which faltered to 5 percent in
the fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years. To
do that, experts say, Sinha will have to spend on infrastructure
and encourage investment. His revenue options have been reduced
since the United States, Australia, Japan and other nations cut off
loans and all but humanitarian aid to punish India for conducting
five nuclear tests May 11-13. (INDIA-BUDGET)
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aircraft laden with emergency aid
flew Monday to northern Afghanistan to help the victims of a
weekend earthquake that buried as many as 3,000 people, many still
struggling from a temblor that struck the region three months
before. The powerful magnitude-6.9 quake wiped out entire villages,
sliced mountains and triggered landslides. While initial estimates
are putting the death toll at 3,000, aid workers and local
officials in the area believe it could rise to 5,000. There are
thousands of people still missing and thousands more homeless.
``This is a mountainous region and the force of the earthquake sent
houses crashing down the hillsides toward the valleys below,'' said
Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, head of the U.N. humanitarian aid office
in neighboring Pakistan. (AFGHANISTAN-QUAKE)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Passengers were stranded Monday at airports across
France after Air France pilots began a strike that threatened to
disrupt travel plans during the World Cup soccer games. Monitors at
Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for passengers:
``annule,'' _ canceled _ written in red next to almost all
international and domestic flights. The strike began at midnight
after Air France failed to reach an agreement with pilots seeking
to block wage cuts. Air France set up special telephone lines for
passengers seeking information on flights. There was no immediate
indication of how many flights were canceled or which routes were
most affected. Most of the company's aircraft _ many of them
decorated with players representing the 32 World Cup teams _
remained grounded Monday. Air France is the official carrier for
the World Cup. (AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's government seized the nation's
largest airline on Monday after 1,033 unionized flight attendants
walked off the job. Members of the Unionized Association of Flight
Attendants went on strike at midnight, saying Aeromexico was
unwilling to negotiate better working conditions and benefits. The
government, saying national security was at state, temporarily
seized Aviacion de Mexico, which runs Mexico's largest airline, and
appointed an acting general administrator for the duration of the
strike. Under Mexico's constitution, the government can temporarily
seize companies considered vital to the nation's economy or
security so that they can continue to operate during emergencies.
Thousands of passengers were left in limbo, as the secretariat
official conceded that most of Aeromexico's 300 daily flights
wouldn't leave the ground. (MEXICO-AIRLINE STRIKE)

Islamic organization urges India-Pakistan talks after nuclear tests transition.

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A leading Islamic organization on
Monday expressed ``deep concern'' over nuclear tests carried out
this month by India and Pakistan and urged immediate talks by the
two nations.
	   The Jiddah-based Organization of the Islamic Conference said in
a statement from its secretary-general, Azeddine Laraki, that it
had wanted the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in South
Asia.
	   ``Following the latest nuclear explosions carried out by India
and Pakistan, the secretary-general of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference expressed his deep concern over this serious
development,'' the statement said.
	   ``In the wake of these nuclear explosions, the international
community must seriously encourage both India and Pakistan to
expediently conclude a non-aggression agreement with the aim of
ensuring the promotion of peace and security in the region,'' it
said.
	   The Gulf nation of Bahrain also urged both India and Pakistan to
exercise restraint to ensure peace and stability in the Indian
subcontinent. Government-controlled newspapers reported Monday that
Bahrain issued such a statement during Sunday's weekly cabinet
meeting.
	   India exploded five nuclear devices two weeks ago, prompting
Pakistan to follow suit despite warnings from the U.N. Security
Council, the United States and other nations.
	   Pakistan said it detonated five nuclear devices on Thursday and
another one Saturday.
	   India has fought three wars with Pakistan since both countries
gained independence from colonial British rule in 1947.
	   The 55-member Organization of the Islamic Conference said in its
statement that it hoped Pakistan's nuclear explosions would not
fuel anti-Muslim sentiment.
	   It urged ``international public opinion to foil every biased
attempt aimed at using the latest nuclear explosions as a pretext
to launch an unjustifiable offensive against the Islamic (world).''
It added that Islamic states have always supported elimination of
nuclear arms.
	   Pakistan is the only Muslim nation known to have developed a
nuclear bomb.

Globalization worsens child sexual abuse; clean governments needed

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Globalization is turning the world into
a more dangerous place for children to be exploited for sex, making
clean government and uncorrupt officials ever more necessary to
protect them, a former Thai prime minister said Monday.
	   ``It has become easier for the traffic in children by means of
abduction, tricks and enticements both within countries and across
borders,'' said Anand Panyarachun, opening a Asia-Pacific
conference on human resources development for youths.
	   The week-long conference, hosted by the United Nations' Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, was told an
estimated 10 million children worldwide were working as
prostitutes, with some 1 million being added every year.
	   Meanwhile, the Internet has put a tool into the hands of
pornographers to spread thousands of sexual pictures of children
around the world at ``the push of a button,'' Anand said in a
keynote address.
	   ``Children are dealt with as commodities, traded and exchanged
as part of an increasingly borderless world,'' said Anand, who led
reformist governments in 1991 and 1992 in a country notorious for
child prostitution.
	   Currently the United Nations Children's Fund ambassador to
Thailand, Anand said that trafficking was abetted by governments
that allow corruption enabling law enforcement officials to turn a
blind eye to _ or help for profit _ gangs exploiting children.
	   Government transparency and enforcement of what Anand called
``child-friendly laws'' would go a long way toward cleaning up an
environment that allows the ``dark forces'' of corrupt police and
criminals exploiting children to thrive.
	   Anand suggested a series of measures to promote child rights and
good governance, including improved screening and training of law
enforcement personnel, more support and incentives for good law
enforcement and greater penalties for corruption.
	   Poverty breeds abuse and exploitation, Anand said, while lack of
access to education renders children more vulnerable to the sex
market. Family disintegration, migration and negative traditional
practices are also factors.
	   ``We cannot be forever insensitive to the cries for help of
these children,'' Ofelia Calceta-Santos of the Philippines, a
special U.N. investigator into the sale of children said at a panel
discussion.
	   To tackle the problem, she said, ``We need a wedding to have
good children, a wedding between governments and non-governmental
organizations.''
	   The head of a private multinational organization against child
sex abuse said there were perhaps as many as 1 million children
under the age of 16 held in virtual slavery in brothels in Asia.
	   ``Many of the children in brothels die quite young, of AIDS,
drugs, suicide,'' said Ron O'Grady, chairman of ECPAT _ End Child
Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking.
	   O'Grady also warned that child pornography on the Internet is
widespread, easy to find, and cruel and insidious in its effects.
	   He said that foreign sex tourists often take videos of photos of
themselves abusing children, and can post them around the world on
the Internet within 24 hours.
	   ``The internet goes beyond national boundaries, breaking down
national laws,'' he said. ``In the 21st century national laws and
boundaries will become increasingly irrelevant.''

Arab leaders confer on planned summit, differ on meeting's goal BY SALAH NASRAWI 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab leaders are holding intensive talks on
a proposed summit meeting aimed at reviving the Middle East peace
process, but the leaders are reported to differ widely over what
direction the summit should take.
	   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held talks on a summit with Syrian
President Hafez Assad on Sunday and will meet Monday with Jordan's
King Hussein. Arab foreign ministers were expected to discuss the
issue Tuesday in Beirut at a meeting on Arab ties to Europe.
	   The summit would be a follow-up to a convening of Arab leaders
in 1996, shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
election, that warned of a harsh reaction if Netanyahu failed to
fulfill pledges in peace pacts.
	   Holding a summit now is being pushed by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat who has urged the Arabs to take a tougher stance
toward Netanyahu since peace talks have reached a complete
stalemate.
	   Talaat Hamid, spokesman for the 22-member Arab League, said
Monday that the proposed meeting would try to forge a unified Arab
position ``against the obstacles Israel erects in the face of
peace.''
	   He told The Associated Press that consultations are under way
over the time and place for the summit, but he gave no details.
	   Osama el-Baz, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, was quoted Monday in Cairo newspapers as saying the
leaders also were trying to agree on who should attend and the
meeting's agenda.
	   Last week, Arafat said the conference should work out a unified
Arab strategy to ``confront Israeli arrogance.'' He made visits to
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states to convince their leaders to
attend such a gathering.
	   The move reflects his frustration with U.S. mediation, which has
failed to convince Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13
percent pullback in the West Bank to restart talks. Arafat, who
wanted 30 percent, has accepted.
	   Arab diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Jordan's King Hussein is reluctant to attend a conference in Syria
where he expects Assad to push for a hardline stance against
Israel.
	   Syria has been calling to activate a resolution by the 1996 Arab
summit to suspend ties with the Jewish state if progress was not
made toward peace.
	   Jordan's foreign minister, Jawad Anani, told The Associated
Press that Jordan supports holding a summit ``as long as it
produces the right results.''
	   He did not elaborate. But Jordan, the strongest advocate of
peace with Israel, would likely oppose any more to express outright
hostility.
	   Another hurdle to the summit is who to invite. Most Gulf states
still oppose asking Iraqi President Saddam Hussein because of his
1990 invasion of Kuwait. Syria says Iraq's presence is needed for a
united stance against Israel.
	   Several Arab countries also are unwilling to attend a summit on
the Palestinian issue while the United States still is mediating.
Once Washington announces its efforts have failed, Arafat would
likely meet less resistance.
	   On Monday, the London-based Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat derided
suggestions for holding a summit now, saying it would only show how
divided the Arabs remain.
	   ``Arabs love meeting,'' it said. ``The outcome of the meeting
doesn't matter; the important thing is to meet. This is proof of
the size of the gap that separates Arab countries, so much that a
mere rendezvous has become a hope and a dream.''

India denies it has plans for another nuclear test With Pakistan-India 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with India calling for nuclear talks. No pickup.
By HEMA SHUKLA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday denied Pakistani
allegations that it had plans for another nuclear test in this
already volatile region.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was
surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was
``surprising'' _ and wrong.
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing, and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   On Sunday, the Indian foreign ministry reaffirmed New Delhi's
willingness to adhere to a voluntary moratorium on further tests
and its offer of a no-first-strike pact with Islamabad.
	   The ministry, in a statement, also urged all nuclear weapon
states to open early negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention.
	   India was the first to escalate the long-standing Indo-Pakistan
rivalry to the nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In
response, Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices
last week.
	   ``I have credible information that they (the Indians) are
already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast
somewhere in the first or second week in July,'' Khan told CNN
Sunday.
	   Pakistan has not said whether it would test again. U.S.
intelligence sources said over the weekend they had detected no
signs that either Pakistan or India was readying new tests.
	   The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to
sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed in its
entirety by both countries. Indian-held Kashmir is the only
Muslim-majority state in the country.
	   Violence broke out Monday in Srinagar, the capital of
Indian-held Kashmir, after about 100 people who oppose Indian rule
distributed sweets in the streets _ a traditional way of
celebrating _ and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its
nuclear tests. Some of the protesters threw stones at police, who
responded by beating the protesters. The crowd dispersed after half
an hour.
	   Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups
fighting either for Kashmir's independence or its union with
Pakistan. Pakistan says it lends them only moral support.

Malaysia criticizes nuclear adventurism in Asia 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With three nuclear powers now in
the region, Asian nations must halt moves toward nuclear
adventurism, Malaysia's deputy prime minister said Monday.
	   ``We must oppose opportunistic politicians who fan the flames of
jingoism, be it in the name of religion or state,'' Anwar Ibrahim
said in a speech at a regional meeting on confidence building and
conflict reduction.
	   Anwar's comments reflected the growing concern over India's and
Pakistan's nuclear tests among Asian nations that do not have huge
armies or nuclear programs.
	   Malaysia has opposed the tests and urged India and Pakistan to
refrain from entering into a regional nuclear arms race. India
conducted five nuclear tests last month and Pakistan, its archenemy
to the West, last week replied with five tests of its own. China
was the first Asian nation to develop nuclear weapons.
	   ``We must constantly remind ourselves that in any conflict it is
always the people, not the state, who pay the price,'' he was
quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   Anwar said although Asia had three nuclear powers now, the
region that is home to half of the world's population remained
mired in poverty and destitution.
	   Diplomacy in Asia must go beyond conventional confidence
building measures to finding remedies to remove suspicion and
distrust and heal the wounds of history, he said.
	   ``Confidence building has not worked precisely because we have
not probed into the roots of suspicions and distrust between
states,'' Anwar said.
	   Asia's economic crisis was in part a result of a mismatch
between the old-fashioned national systems and the global system in
an information age, he said.
	   Asian minds were still trapped in the second industrial
revolution which was the age of automobiles and airplanes, he said.
	   ``Thus, we have become T-Rex, trying to live beyond the Jurassic
Age.''

Yemen executes convicted murderer in public square 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man convicted of murder and robbery was
executed in a public square in southern Yemen, al-Thawra newspaper
reported Monday.
	   Fayez Ahmed al-Faqeeh was executed Sunday by firing squad in the
main square in the city of Ibb, 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of
the capital San`a, the government-run newspaper said.
	   Al-Faqeeh shot Ali Mohammed Aamel last November with an assault
gun and robbed him, the paper said.
	   The execution was attended by a large crowd including Aamel's
family, the paper reported.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, applies the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Indonesian corruption probe to include Suharto businesses 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Authorities have launched an
investigation of government corruption under ex-President Suharto
but have no plans to target the former leader, the attorney general
said Monday.
	   The inquiry is expected to encompass business dealings of
Suharto's family, which used its connections to make billions of
dollars from a wide range of industries during his three decades in
power.
	   As part of the general investigation, Attorney General Sudjono
Atmonegoro said he had received guarantees from Suharto's family
members that they would not leave Indonesia.
	   The probe will not specifically target Suharto and his family
although the former president may be summoned to check evidence, he
said at a news conference.
	   Critics say nepotism, corruption and cronyism that thrived under
Suharto contributed in large part to Indonesia's economic woes.
Suharto quit May 21 following riots over price increases and under
pressure from student protesters who occupied Parliament.
	   A leading opposition figure has called on Suharto to donate the
bulk of his wealth back to the country. Amien Rais, a prominent
Muslim leader, said that with the money Indonesia would not have to
beg for assistance from international agencies to prop up the
economy, which is in its worst crisis in 30 years.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Britain's Prince Andrew arrived in the
former Soviet republic of Latvia on Wednesday on a tour that has
already taken him to Estonia and Russia.
	   Prince Andrew was to meet Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, tour
a children's hospital and open a telephone exchange. He also was to
place flowers at a monument to British sailors who died in Latvia's
independence war against Russia in 1918.

Conservative leader hails co-ed prayer service as precedent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A decision by police to let men and women pray
together at the Western Wall despite violent protests by
ultra-Orthodox Jews set a ``historic precedent,'' the leader of the
Conservative stream of Judaism said Monday.
	   The Western Wall is Judaism's holiest site, and men and women
pray in segregated areas, in line with ultra-Orthodox practices. In
the past, police routinely moved followers of the more liberal
Reform and Conservative streams away from the Wall if they wanted
to hold co-ed services.
	   However, on Sunday, the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, police acted
as a human buffer to allow some 300 Reform and Conservative
worshippers to hold a two-hour prayer service at the Wall. Hundreds
of angry ultra-Orthodox Jews cursed the Reform and Conservative
worshippers and threw garbage and bags of chocolate milk over the
police barrier.
	   Rabbi Ehud Bandel, president of the Conservative movement in
Israel, said Monday that police set a ``historic precedent'' by
protecting the Conservative and Reform worshippers.
	   It was not immediately clear whether police had adopted a new
policy. Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said police had
decided conditions Sunday morning made the co-ed worship possible.
	   The Reform and Conservative movements are dominant among U.S.
Jews, but tiny in Israel, where the Orthodox establishment has a
monopoly over religious affairs, including marriage and divorce.
	   The Chief Rabbinate in Israel had asked police that the liberal
Jews be barred from praying at the Western Wall, warning that a
co-ed service was provocative and could lead to violence.

Moi leads Kenya in celebrating independence 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos NAI101-102
By GEORGE MWANGI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi, celebrating
steps toward independence 35 years ago, Monday called on Kenyans to
work together to find solutions to problems including corruption,
poverty and unemployment.
	   ``Among the many challenges we face, the most critical are
poverty and unemployment,'' Moi said. ``The war on poverty has yet
to be won.''
	   Moi addressed a crowd of thousands which gathered for Madaraka
Day, the 35th anniversary of when Kenya gained the right to
self-government from British colonialists. Kenya became fully
independent on Dec. 12, 1963.
	   For the national holiday, the capital was decorated in the
black, red and green of the Kenyan flag. At an open-air ceremony in
Uhuru (Freedom) Park, troops marched past Moi, politicians and
diplomats, church choirs sang, and traditional dancers performed.
	   Last Madaraka Day, Moi dismissed opposition demands for
constitutional reforms ahead of elections, while police confined
opposition leaders to their homes to prevent them from disrupting
Moi's speech. Donor countries subsequently forced Moi to make some
compromises before the election in December, which he won for a
fifth, five-year term.
	   On Monday, Moi, 74, expressed thanks to those parties which are
cooperating with the ruling Kenya African National Union, whose
leadership he vowed to retain even after he retires from the
presidency.
	   ``I do hope that other political parties will see the need to
join hands ... peace and unity for the development and prosperity
for this nation.''
	   Opposition leader Mwai Kibaki, who was in the audience,
condemned Moi's remark, asking ``How can we cooperate with a
government which send people with bows and arrows to disrupt our
meeting?'' Last weekend, one man was killed and 20 injured when
thugs disrupted an opposition meeting in rural Kitale.
	   To fight the country's economic problems, Moi said he would try
to bring down ``excessively high interest rates,'' now at 27.97
percent.
	   Also, he promised to strengthen Kenya's tax collection system
and crack down on ``unpatriotic Kenyans who deny the government
revenue.''
	   Moi condemned corruption, saying it has undermined the
efficiency and effectiveness of public sector operations. Many
donor countries have blamed Moi for allowing corruption to thrive
in Kenya.
	   Shifting to Swahili, Moi, sounding a familiar theme, condemned
foreigners who ``come here to tell us how to live. We know
ourselves that if we don't unify the future will be difficult.''

Travelers Group takes 25 percent stake in top Japanese brokerage

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Travelers Group Inc. said Monday it will take a
one-quarter stake in Nikko Securities Co., Japan's third-largest
brokerage house, in one of the most aggressive moves to date in the
Japanese market by an American financial powerhouse.
	   The New York-based company will become Nikko's biggest
shareholder, taking over from top Japanese lender Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. Nikko will buy a smaller stake in Travelers
Group to solidify the broad-based tie-up.
	   Travelers' announcement comes less than a month after it
unveiled an dlrs 82 billion merger with Citicorp to create the
world's largest financial services company.
	   ``Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more
productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world,''
said Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of
Travelers Group, speaking at a press conference in Tokyo.
	   The deal marks the latest move by a major Wall Street firm to
strengthen its position in Japan in the midst of a major effort to
liberalize the Japanese financial industry by 2001. The reforms,
dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' are expected to open up a pool of personal
financial assets worth an estimated dlrs 9 trillion.
	   A number of other big names on Wall Street have also expanded in
Japan. In February, Merrill Lynch and Co. hired 2,100 former
employees of the failed Yamaichi Securities Co. to staff 33 retail
outlets nationwide. Fidelity Investments Co. has announced similar
plans.
	   As part of their strategic alliance, Travelers and Nikko plan to
link their world-wide securities sales and trading businesses. They
will also set up a jointly-owned Tokyo-based securities company
with working capital of more than 140 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion).
	   The Japanese venture, to be called Nikko Salomon Smith Barney
Ltd., will incorporate the investment banking, consumer product and
research operations of Nikko Securities, one of Japan's ``Big
Three'' brokers.
	   It will be headed by Yuji Shirakawa, currently president of
Nikko Research Center. Toshiharu Kojima, chief executive of Salomon
Smith Barney in Japan, will become co-chief executive of the
venture, along with a Nikko Securities official.
	   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange launched an investigation
Monday over possible insider trading involving Nikko shares after
the price of its stock jumped Friday, an exchange official said.
	   Nikko shares closed at 436 yen (dlrs 3.16) Friday, up 20 yen
(dlrs 14 cents) from Thursday's close, after rising by as much as
10 percent. A total of 8.59 million Nikko shares were traded on
Friday, about 5.9 times the amount traded on Thursday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to
provide other details.

Cabinet meeting ends without decision on West Bank withdrawal 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite growing U.S. pressure on Israel to make
a decision, Israel's Cabinet on Monday again failed to reach
agreement on the the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israel's continued indecision is likely to further strain ties
with the United States, which reportedly has demanded an Israeli
answer within several days to its proposal for a pullback from 13
percent.
	   However, U.S. ultimatums have come and gone in the past month
without repercussions for Israel. It appeared Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was more concerned about the survival of his
government than about possible U.S. censure.
	   A U.S. official said Monday that he did not expect the Clinton
administration to make good on veiled threats to announce the
failure of the U.S. peace initiative and blame Israel. Instead,
Washington will give Israel more time to reach a decision, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Far-right Cabinet ministers have threatened to topple the
government if Netanyahu agreed to a 13 percent pullback.
	   ``A 13 percent withdrawal would be a disaster for Jewish
settlements,'' Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom from the National
Religious Party told Israel radio Monday. ``We cannot agree. We
were assured by the prime minister that there would be no troop
redeployment that will hurt the settlements.''
	   Recent polls have suggested that a large majority in Israel want
Netanyahu to forge ahead with the peace negotiations and agree to a
troop withdrawal.
	   The Jewish Settlers' Council on Monday launched a campaign to
turn Israeli public opinion against a 13 percent troop pullback. It
mailed brochures to 1 million homes in Israel, with maps
illustrating the settlers' arguments that a pullback would endanger
water resources, Israeli security and control over Jewish holy
sites.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been trying for
months to break the deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal for an immediate
13 percent pullback, to be followed by another significant
withdrawal whose scope has not been determined.
	   Israel radio and the Maariv daily reported Monday that Netanyahu
was considering a 15 percent pullback in three stages. Netanyahu's
adviser, David Bar-Illan, was not immediately available for
comment, but the radio said Netanyahu denied the report.

Russian hard-liners to push impeachment motion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian hard-liners will try to get an impeachment
motion against President Boris Yeltsin put on parliament's agenda
during a scheduling session next week, a prominent hard-liner said
Monday.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the hard-line Agrarian faction,
said Yeltsin opponents will ask members of the agenda-setting Duma
Council on June 9 to formally file the motion and set up a
committee to study the proposal. His comments were reported by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Impeachment proceedings are long and complex, and it would
likely take months before the motion is actually debated by
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Communists and their allies, including the Agrarians, launched
the latest impeachment campaign last month, gathering 205
signatures in the 450-seat Duma.
	   They have accused Yeltsin of a range of transgressions,
including instigating the Soviet collapse, launching the botched
war in Chechnya and ruining the country's economy.
	   Their frustrations intensified in April during a long test of
wills with Yeltsin, who threatened to disband the legislature
unless lawmakers approved his candidate for prime minister.
	   Several previous impeachment drives have fizzled, in part
because Russia's Constitution gives the president the upper hand in
confrontations with parliament.

in Kournikova-Novotna match American women thrive in Paris 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Majoli defeating Martinez, explains controversy
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The American men may have bombed out at this year's
French Open, but the women are doing just fine, thank you.
	   With Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles all
advancing Sunday, more U.S. women have reached the quarterfinals
than in any French Open since 1986.
	   They were almost joined by the other Williams sister, Serena.
But she folded in the second set of a contentious match against
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario after coming within two points of victory.
	   ``I'm only 16, my first Roland Garros,'' Serena said after the
match. ``Everything is a learning experience for me.''
	   That may be the one thing Sanchez Vicario agreed with.
	   ``I taught her a lesson,'' the fourth-seeded Spaniard said
angrily after the match.
	   It was a lesson that featured glares across the net, an unusual
dress change by the Spaniard, and a slam by Williams that nearly
beheaded her opponent.
	   Williams accused Sanchez Vicario of changing from a black outfit
to a white one midway through the second set as a strategic move.
Sanchez Vicario, for her part, was upset at Williams' attitude
after a controversial point in the first set.
	   ``I just think she doesn't have respect. She cannot go in with
that attitude,'' said Sanchez Vicario. ``You know, I'm glad I beat
her.''
	   So Serena will have to watch her sister in the quarters, and it
should be one of the most intriguing matches of the tournament.
	   Venus Williams will play top-seeded Martina Hingis, another
match in a rivalry quickly becoming one of the best in women's
sports.
	   The elder Williams advanced Sunday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in which she slammed seven aces _ two
at 116 mph.
	   Hingis was a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Anna Smashnova of Israel in a
match between former French Open junior champions.
	   Venus Williams, the No. 8 seed, has lost just 13 games in her
four matches at the French Open. Hingis has lost 14 games.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, but they are 2-2
this year.
	   Sanchez Vicario will face Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals.
No. 2 Davenport and No. 6 Seles also advanced to the quarters.
	   Davenport will face defending champion Iva Majoli, the 10th
seed, who ousted No. 7 Conchita Martinez 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (3-7), 6-3
in a match completed Monday.
	   Majoli and Martinez were tied at a set apiece when darkness
halted play Sunday night. Martinez jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead
in the third set, then lost the last five games.
	   Seles will face No. 3 Jana Novotna or No. 13 Anna Kournikova.
Novotna led 7-6 (7-2) 3-6, 4-2 when play was halted Sunday night at
Novotna's request. That left Kournikova in tears because she had
made the same request a game earlier, but was denied.
	   According to international tennis rules, a match can be halted
due to darkness only on an even-number game in a set.
	   Seles, a three-time champion who never has lost before the
quarterfinals in Paris, won 6-1, 6-4 over Chanda Rubin.
	   As the second week of the tournament gets started, the women's
side appears to have a bit of everything.
	   There's star quality in Kournikova, power and attitude in Venus
Williams, the world's No. 1 player in Hingis, and a touching story
in Seles, who is playing only two weeks after losing her coach and
father.
	   What's left on the men's side?
	   Certainly not many of the world's top players. With 12 men left
in the draw, only No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios remains of the top 10.
The next seed left is No. 12 Carlos Moya. Then there's No. 14 Alex
Corretja, No. 15 Felix Mantilla and No. 16 Alberto Berasategui.
	   Also remaining are the world's 45th-ranked player, the 69th and
the 116th.
	   No U.S. man made it through the third round, the worst showing
in a Grand Slam event in at least 30 years.
	   Gone are the reigning champions of the other three Grand Slams:
top-seeded Pete Sampras (Wimbledon), No. 2 Petr Korda (Australian
Open) and No. 4 Pat Rafter (U.S. Open).
	   Also gone are some of the more charismatic players, such as
American Andre Agassi and last year's surprise champion, Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil.
	   The remaining marquee player, Rios, has a huge following in
Chile, and his fans bring gigantic Chilean flags to his matches.
But in the rest of the world, he is well known for a cold and
haughty attitude.
	   There is one exciting story on the men's side being written by
Marat Safin, the 18-year-old Russian qualifier ranked 116th in the
world, who's beaten Agassi and Kuerten here.
	   Safin powered his way through the first three rounds much like
Williams, with brawn and with aces.
	   He's attracted Kournikova-like attention with his athletic good
looks. And his post-match news conferences resemble those of
Hingis: smiles and jokes.

Arab leaders confer on planned summit, differ on meeting's goal BY SALAH NASRAWI 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab leaders are holding intensive talks on
a proposed summit aimed at reviving the Middle East peace process,
but they reportedly disagree over what direction the summit should
take and whom to invite.
	   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held talks on a summit with Syrian
President Hafez Assad on Sunday and will meet Monday with Jordan's
King Hussein. Arab foreign ministers were expected to discuss the
issue Tuesday in Beirut at a meeting on Arab ties to Europe.
	   The summit would be a follow-up to a convening of Arab leaders
in 1996, shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
election, that warned of a harsh reaction if Netanyahu failed to
fulfill pledges in peace pacts.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been pushing for the
summit, has urged the Arabs to take a tougher stance toward
Netanyahu since peace talks have deadlocked.
	   Talaat Hamid, spokesman for the 22-member Arab League, said
Monday that the proposed meeting would try to forge a unified Arab
position ``against the obstacles Israel erects in the face of
peace.''
	   He told The Associated Press that consultations are under way
over the time and place for the summit, but he gave no details.
	   Osama el-Baz, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, was quoted Monday in Cairo newspapers as saying the
leaders also were trying to agree on who should attend and the
meeting's agenda.
	   Last week, Arafat said the conference should work out a unified
Arab strategy to ``confront Israeli arrogance.'' He made visits to
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states to convince their leaders to
attend such a gathering.
	   The move reflects his frustration with U.S. mediation, which has
failed to convince Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13
percent pullback in the West Bank to restart talks. Arafat, who
wanted 30 percent, has accepted.
	   Arab diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Jordan's King Hussein is reluctant to attend a conference in Syria,
where he expects Assad to push for a hard-line stance against
Israel.
	   Syria has been calling to activate a resolution by the 1996 Arab
summit to suspend ties with the Jewish state if progress was not
made toward peace.
	   Jordan's foreign minister, Jawad Anani, told The Associated
Press that Jordan supports holding a summit ``as long as it
produces the right results.''
	   He did not elaborate. But Jordan, the strongest advocate of
peace with Israel, would likely oppose any more to express outright
hostility.
	   Another hurdle to the summit is who to invite. Most Gulf states
still oppose asking Iraqi President Saddam Hussein because of his
1990 invasion of Kuwait. Syria says Iraq's presence is needed for a
united stance against Israel.
	   Several Arab countries also are unwilling to attend a summit on
the Palestinian issue while the United States still is mediating.
Once Washington announces its efforts have failed, Arafat would
likely meet less resistance.

Sony to acquire 6.7 percent stake in Japanese software company 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sony Corp. will acquire a 6.7 percent stake in
Justsystem Corp., a major Japanese software maker suffering a slump
in sales, a spokeswoman for the software maker said on Monday.
	   Sony hopes to take advantage of Justsystem's software
development skills to stengthen its position in the market for
digital consumer appliances _ electronic gadgets that incorporate
computer functions _ a Sony employee said.
	   Under a basic agreement between the two companies, Sony will buy
the entire block _ 2 million shares worth 1.27 billion yen (dlrs
9.16 million) _ of a new stock issuance by Justsystem scheduled for
July, said Kyoko Kamata, spokeswoman of Justsystem.
	   Justsystem, based in Tokushima, 515 kilometers (322 miles),
southwest of Tokyo, suffered a 5.19 billion yen (dlrs 37.34
million) net loss for the year ended March 31 on sales of 21.77
billion yen (dlrs 156.61 million), down 30.2 percent from a year
before.
	   It was the first time that the company posted a loss since its
foundation in 1981.
	   Justsystem is popularly known for its ``Ichitaro''
Japanese-language word-processing program, but its sales suffered
last year because of the slumping domestic economy and Microsoft
Corp.'s penetration into the Japanese market.
	   The Japan Securities Dealers' Association said it suspended
trade of Justsystem shares Monday as officials needed time to
verify a newspaper report on the planned tie-up with Sony.

Kaunda freed as state withdraws coup allegations prosecution'' procedure that can have case reopened

Eds: UPDATES with Kaunda quotes, reaction, color, more on ``no
By ANGUS SHAW
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda was freed
by a court Monday after spending five months under house arrest for
allegedly knowing about plans for coup last year by junior military
officers.
	   Kaunda, 74, waved to supporters on the steps of the Lusaka High
Court after state prosecutors dropped the case against him,
apparently on lack of evidence.
	   ``I feel great,'' said Kaunda, wearing a thick white beard he
has grown since his arrest on Christmas day. Supporters waved
two-finger victory salutes and cheered.
	   Jubilant supporter Christopher Malama described Kaunda's release
as a triumph for their opposition party.
	   ``Our father is out. We are very happy today,'' he said.
	   Also freed by Judge Japhet Banda was Moyce Kaulungombe, Kaunda's
bodyguard. Both men were charged with concealing prior knowledge of
an Oct. 28, 1997, coup attempt by junior military officers that was
quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale told Banda the state entered
a plea of
	   ``nolle prosequi,'' the legal term for ``no prosecution,'' a
procedure normally used when the state lacks sufficient evidence or
does not wish to proceed with a case that can be reopened later.
	   ``This means the state doesn't wish to proceed further. You are
discharged
	   so you are free men,'' Banda told Kaunda and Kaulungombe.
	   But Kaunda was defiant, saying he was not satisfied with the
case being dropped.
	   ``I want a complete acquittal. I am very clean,'' he told
reporters.
	   Kaunda dismissed reports that President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa asked President Frederick Chiluba for his release in return
for Kaunda retiring from politics.
	   ``I am going to listen to the people who have been discussing
this, then I'll decide,'' Kaunda said.
	   Kaunda drove through downtown Lusaka, waving his trademark white
handkerchief, and was scheduled to meet with supporters and
colleagues at the headquarters of his United National Independence
Party, the main opposition group.
	   The drama came on the first day of the trials of 81 suspects _
most of them soldiers _ who were arrested after junior officers
stormed the state broadcast center and claimed to have overthrown
Chiluba's government.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In its annual effort to reduce rush-hour
traffic and summer pollution, the government began staggered
working hours Monday.
	   Under the new hours, which end Sept. 30, public services open at
7 a.m., banks at 7:45 a.m., supermarkets at 8 a.m. and all other
shops by 9 a.m.
	   The sultry summer weather in Athens elevates smog levels, often
to degrees considered dangerous to health.
	   A partial ban on cars in central Athens is scheduled to be
lifted Aug. 3-23 because of fewer drivers in the capital during the
peak vacation period for Greeks.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Britain's Prince Andrew arrived in the
former Soviet republic of Latvia on Monday on a tour that has
already taken him to Estonia and Russia.
	   Prince Andrew was to meet Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, tour
a children's hospital and open a telephone exchange. He also was to
place flowers at a monument to British sailors who died in Latvia's
independence war against Russia in 1918.
	   The Latvian Foreign Ministry said it attached great importance
to the Duke of York's two-day visit.
	   ``It shows just how strong the political and historic ties are
between Latvia and Great Britain,'' said foreign ministry spokesman
Andrejs Pildegovics.

Somali gunmen kill four bus passengers in Mogadishu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Gunmen killed four people and wounded
five others in an attack Monday on a bus in south Mogadishu,
witnesses said.
	   An armed guard on the bus returned fire, they said. The bus
driver and conductor were seriously wounded, and were taken to a
nearby hospital.
	   The attack may have been in retaliation for the robbery of
another bus last week by subclansmen of the owner of the bus that
was hit Monday, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In a separate incident also in the south of the capital, gunmen
on Saturday abducted a Somali working for the French aid group,
Action Against Hunger, aid workers said.
	   Sheikh Omar Awdhegle, who is responsible for the financial
affairs of the agency in Mogadishu, also was abducted in September,
but was released unharmed two days later.
	   Somali has not had central government since the 1991 overthrow
of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. The country is divided up into
clan-based fiefdoms and kidnappings are a common way of extorting
money.
	   Ten Red Cross workers were held hostage for 10 days in the north
of the capital in April before being released unharmed.

Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 3-4, violations in catch records cited
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards detained 13 North Korean
trawlers Monday suspected of illegal fishing in the Bering Sea in
the Russian Far East, a news report said.
	   The boats have been escorted to the regional center of
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   It said Russian border guards and sea inspectors boarded the
North Korean vessels, where they found numerous violations of catch
records and decided to detain the flotilla.
	   The main vessel, a floating fishing factory, had a crew of 196,
ITAR-Tass said. It said the North Koreans did not resist the
Russian border guards. The report didn't say how the trawlers
managed to reach Russia's waters.
	   North Korea is suffering from a deep famine, but tight border
controls in the totalitarian state make it extremely difficult to
leave its territory.
	   Many North Korean defectors are living illegally in Russia with
the hope of reaching capitalist South Korea.

Russia and Japan plan joint naval exercise 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Japan will hold a joint naval exercise
for the first time in the Pacific Ocean in July, the chief of the
Russian General Staff said Monday.
	   Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin met with his Japanese counterpart, Admiral
Kazuya Natsukawa, to discuss upgrading military contacts between
Russia and Japan as part of an effort to conclude a peace treaty by
2000.
	   Five decades after World War II, the two nations have yet to
sign a treaty, mainly because of a territorial dispute over four
tiny islands in the southern Kuril chain that Soviet troops seized
from Japan in the closing days of the war.
	   Kvashnin said no deadline has been set for demilitarizing the
islands as part of military reforms that envisage cutting Russia's
armed forces from 1.8 million servicemen to 1.2 million by 1999,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``The deadlines depend on political agreements, but there are no
specific documents on this issue,'' he said.
	   The naval exercise will involve two Russian and three Japanese
warships in a simulated sea rescue, Kvashnin said.
	   He said he would visit Japan next October or November at
Natsukawa's invitation as part of the program to improve military
ties initiated by President Boris Yeltsin during an April summit in
Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Natsukawa arrived in Moscow Sunday on an eight-day visit. He was
scheduled to spend the first five days of his Russian tour in
Moscow, then travel to the Pacific port of Vladivostok.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A package bomb believed planted by a
shadowy leftist group exploded in central Madrid on Monday slightly
injuring two police officers and causing minor damage to a private
employment agency's offices.
	   Minutes before the packet bomb exploded at 11.30 a.m. (0930
gmt), police received a warning call from a person who claimed to
speak on behalf the armed leftist group GRAPO.
	   The group, whose name is a Spanish acronym for October First
Antifascist Resistance Group, is blamed for killing 60 people in
infrequent bombing and shooting attacks since it first appeared in
the early 1970s.
	   The two police officers suffered slight injuries when the bomb
exploded while they were evacuating the building.
	   As in previous GRAPO attacks, police were unsure what the motive
behind the blast was.
	   GRAPO has claimed responsibility for minor blasts at an
insurance company and two government tax offices so far this year.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The American men may have bombed out at this year's
French Open, but the women are doing just fine, thank you.
	   With Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles all
advancing Sunday, more U.S. women have reached the quarterfinals
than in any French Open since 1986.
	   They were almost joined by the other Williams sister, Serena.
But she folded in the second set of a contentious match against
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario after coming within two points of victory.
	   ``I'm only 16, my first Roland Garros,'' Serena said after the
match. ``Everything is a learning experience for me.''
	   That may be the one thing Sanchez Vicario agreed with.
	   ``I taught her a lesson,'' the fourth-seeded Spaniard said
angrily after the match.
	   It was a lesson that featured glares across the net, an unusual
dress change by the Spaniard, and a slam by Williams that nearly
beheaded her opponent.
	   Williams accused Sanchez Vicario of changing from a black outfit
to a white one midway through the second set as a strategic move.
Sanchez Vicario, for her part, was upset at Williams' attitude
after a controversial point in the first set.
	   ``I just think she doesn't have respect. She cannot go in with
that attitude,'' said Sanchez Vicario. ``You know, I'm glad I beat
her.''
	   So Serena will have to watch her sister in the quarters, and it
should be one of the most intriguing matches of the tournament.
	   Venus Williams will play top-seeded Martina Hingis, another
match in a rivalry quickly becoming one of the best in women's
sports.
	   The elder Williams advanced Sunday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in which she slammed seven aces _ two
at 116 mph.
	   Hingis was a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Anna Smashnova of Israel in a
match between former French Open junior champions.
	   Venus Williams, the No. 8 seed, has lost just 13 games in her
four matches at the French Open. Hingis has lost 14 games.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, but they are 2-2
this year.
	   Sanchez Vicario will face Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals.
No. 2 Davenport and No. 6 Seles also advanced to the quarters.
	   Davenport will face defending champion Iva Majoli, the 10th
seed, who ousted No. 7 Conchita Martinez 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (3-7), 6-3
in a match completed today.
	   Majoli and Martinez were tied at a set apiece when darkness
halted play Sunday night. Martinez jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead
in the third set, then lost the last five games.
	   Seles will face No. 3 Jana Novotna, who defeated No. 13 Anna
Kournikova 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-3 in another match halted Sunday
night. The match was stopped with Novotna leading 4-2 in the final
set. It took Novotna just 12 minutes to finish off the match
Monday.
	   Play was halted Sunday night at Novotna's request, which left
Kournikova in tears because she had made the same request a game
earlier, but was denied.
	   According to international tennis rules, a match can be halted
due to darkness only on an even-number game in a set.
	   ``It was very difficult for me to play the match over two
days,'' Kournikova said. ``It was a new experience for me.''
	   Seles, a three-time champion who never has lost before the
quarterfinals in Paris, won 6-1, 6-4 over Chanda Rubin.
	   As the second week of the tournament gets started, the women's
side appears to have a bit of everything.
	   There's power and attitude in Venus Williams, the world's No. 1
player in Hingis, and a touching story in Seles, who is playing
only two weeks after losing her coach and father.
	   What's left on the men's side?
	   Certainly not many of the world's top players. With 12 men left
in the draw, only No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios remains of the top 10.
The next seed left is No. 12 Carlos Moya. Then there's No. 14 Alex
Corretja, No. 15 Felix Mantilla and No. 16 Alberto Berasategui.
	   Also remaining are the world's 45th-ranked player, the 69th and
the 116th.
	   No U.S. man made it through the third round, the worst showing
in a Grand Slam event in at least 30 years.
	   Gone are the reigning champions of the other three Grand Slams:
top-seeded Pete Sampras (Wimbledon), No. 2 Petr Korda (Australian
Open) and No. 4 Pat Rafter (U.S. Open).
	   Also gone are some of the more charismatic players, such as
American Andre Agassi and last year's surprise champion, Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil.
	   The remaining marquee player, Rios, has a huge following in
Chile, and his fans bring gigantic Chilean flags to his matches.
But in the rest of the world, he is well known for a cold and
haughty attitude.
	   There is one exciting story on the men's side being written by
Marat Safin, the 18-year-old Russian qualifier ranked 116th in the
world, who's beaten Agassi and Kuerten here.
	   Safin powered his way through the first three rounds much like
Williams, with brawn and with aces.
	   He's attracted Kournikova-like attention with his athletic good
looks. And his post-match news conferences resemble those of
Hingis: smiles and jokes.

Collapsed Yamaichi Securities debts even more than claimed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Collapsed Yamaichi Securities Co. said Monday its
liabilities exceeded assets by 22.51 billion yen (dlrs 162 million)
as of March 31, suggesting the broker doesn't have enough money to
repay all its debts.
	   The report contradicted a claim by the Finance Ministry which
said after Yamaichi collapsed last November that the broker had
enough capital to meet all its liabilities.
	   Yamaichi collapsed under the weight of more than 274 billion yen
(dlrs 1.97 million) in the off-the-book losses _ Japan's biggest
corporate failure ever.
	   In Yamaichi's earnings report for the term ended March 31,
Yamaichi suffered a net loss of 460.33 billion yen (dlrs 3.3
billion) as it wrote off 410.9 billion yen (dlrs 2.96 billion) as
special losses following the collapse.
	   Yamaichi's income including trade commission fell by 30 percent
from a year earlier to 147.488 billion yen (dlrs 1.061 billion),
but expenditures for business operations were 201.080 billion yen
(dlrs 1.446 billion).
	   Yamaichi's balance sheet as of March 31 showed that the overall
liabilities totaled 600.227 billion yen (dlrs 4.318 billion),
including 43 billion yen (dlrs 309 million) in subordinated loans,
against overall assets of 577.721 billion yen (dlrs 4.156 billion).
	   A Yamaichi official said Yamaichi is negotiating with the life
and casualty insurers which made the subordinated loans because
Yamaichi is unable to repay nearly half of what it owes them.
	   Yamaichi, one of Japan's ``Big Four'' brokerages, failed after
trying for years to juggle trading losses stemming from the
collapse of real estate and stock markets earlier in the decade.
	   It closed the last of its branches on March 31, lowering the
curtain on 101 years of businesses.

Australian swims from Mexico to Cuba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) _ Australian Susie Maroney was believed to
have become the first person to swim from Mexico to Cuba when her
latest long-distance epic ended early Tuesday.
	   Maroney, 23, touched Cuban soil at 5:03 a.m. (0903 GMT) after
swimming approximately 197 kilometers (122 miles) from Isle Mujere,
Mexico in 38 hours and 33 minutes.
	   Her support team reported she was in fair condition but being
treated for dehydration. Maroney walked onto land in a remote part
of Cuba after being pointed towards a lighthouse by the coast
guard.
	   The distance was less than the 233 kilometers (145 miles)
Maroney had been aiming for, which would have given her an absolute
world record for the farthest any one has ever swum in the ocean.
	   According to the Maroney team, the 197 kilometers (122 miles) is
the farthest any person has swum in the ocean without the aid of
flippers and she will claim it as a new ``honest distance'' world
record.
	   After being treated by the team physician, Maroney was expected
to be taken by boat to Havana, where Cubans who have followed her
latest swim were to welcome her.
	   Last year Maroney became the first person to swim from Cuba to
Florida.

Gadhafi to visit Egypt for talks on trade, investment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is making a
nine-day visit to Egypt starting Tuesday that will focus on trade
relations with Egypt and likely will touch on Libya's feud with the
West over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner.
	   Gadhafi's visit to Egypt, the second in two years, can be
expected to upset the United States which has sought to isolate
Libya because of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Banned from international flights under U.N. sanctions, Gadhafi
is expected to travel by land over the Libyan-Egyptian border to
the town of Saloum and then go on to Cairo.
	   He will be arriving with an entourage including nine ministers
and a team of businessmen. The team will discuss potential Libyan
investments in Egypt, especially in the vast Toshka irrigation
project in southern Egypt.
	   The two countries are to sign seven trade, investment and
manufacturing agreements, according to Egyptian news reports. The
Libyans want to boost trade with Egypt, which now officially totals
492 million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 144 million) annually.
	   Despite U.S. complaints, Egypt has sought to maintain good
relations with its oil-rich neighbor. Gadhafi is likely to raise
the Lockerbie issue in talks scheduled with President Hosni Mubarak
on Tuesday.
	   Lockerbie will also be on his agenda with Arab League Secretary
General Esmet Abdel-Meguid, who is to meet with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on June 14.
	   Both the United States and England have sought to isolate Libya
because of Gadhafi's failure to turn over for trial two Libyans
charged with the Lockerbie bombing. Gadhafi says they cannot get a
fair trial in either country and wants them tried in a neutral
state.
	   In an effort to force Libya to turn over the suspects, the U.N.
Security Council imposed sanctions in March 1992 that ban
international air travel, refuse arms sales to Libya and call for
limiting diplomatic contacts with the country.

Sinn Fein stands up Prince Charles _ saving some British blushes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In a double-edged snub, leaders
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party have turned down an invitation to
a royal garden party because Prince Charles will be there.
	   The announcement Sunday saved the host, Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, from some awkward maneuvering. Now,
she won't have to worry about keeping the Sinn Fein leaders away
from Charles _ whose much-loved great-uncle Lord Mountbatten was
assassinated by the Irish Republican Army in 1979 _ when guests
mingle Wednesday in the grounds of her Hillsborough Castle
residence.
	   Sinn Fein said that leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness
will boycott the party because Charles holds the ceremonial
position of colonel-in-chief of the Parachute Regiment whose
members were involved in Bloody Sunday in 1972. Thirteen Catholic
marchers were shot dead in the British army's worst shooting in
this province.
	   Adams, Sinn Fein's president, and McGuinness, the party's chief
negotiator in the peace talks, won't show up ``due to unresolved
circumstances surrounding the murders,'' party chairman Mitchel
McLaughlin said.
	   After a long campaign by relatives of the victims, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair this year authorized a new investigation into
Bloody Sunday, which is being carried out by an international panel
of judges.
	   Leaders of pro-British Protestant parties accused Mowlam of
blundering and insensitivity by inviting Sinn Fein to the party,
being held to mark the 50th anniversary of the state-funded
National Health Service in Northern Ireland.
	   Before Sinn Fein said it wouldn't be going, Mowlam promised to
make sure Charles didn't meet Adams and McGuinness, who hold two of
the 18 Northern Ireland seats in the 659-member British House of
Commons.
	   ``That won't happen. I can guarantee that,'' Mowlam said of the
possibility.
	   ``It will be I who will escort the royal round, and I will make
very sure who he meets,'' she added in a BBC television interview.
	   David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, said Mowlam ``must be mightily relieved that her
grave error of judgment has not led to worse consequences.''
	   Charles' office made no comment. But Blair's press spokesman,
Alastair Campbell, said Charles' staff knew Adams and McGuinness
were being invited.

Hoddle says he dropped Gascoigne solely for lack of fitness 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with Hoddle press conference, quotes
PVS: London
<TEXT>
	   LA MANGA, Spain (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle said Monday he
dropped controversial midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the final
22-man World Cup team solely because he wasn't fit.
	   On Sunday, Hoddle stunned England with his decision not to
include the 31-year-old Gascoigne, rated by some as the best
midfielder in English history.
	   The story was one of the biggest soccer items to hit England
since the team won its sole World Cup in 1966.
	   As well as Gascoigne, Hoddle also dropped five other players _
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, Manchester United's Phil Neville
and Nicky Butt, Coventry's Dion Dublin and Everton's Andy
Hinchcliffe _ to get down to the final 22-man team.
	   But all attention Monday focused on Gascoigne, a highly skilled,
creative player who has filled the tabloid press in recent years
with reports of his fast-paced, hard-drinking life off the pitch.
	   ``He (Gascoigne) was not selected on his fitness levels and his
form over the last two or three months,'' said Hoddle, speaking at
a news conference in this southeastern Spanish resort where England
has been training.
	   ``We have run out of time getting him to the (fitness) levels I
needed,'' Hoddle added. ``I am as disappointed as Paul that he is
not with us but I have had to make a very tough decision. It was a
difficult one for me to call.''
	   ``It's a great pity that Paul has not got himself fit. It's a
pity he has so many injuries over the last months and the injuries
kept coming.''
	   Hoddle, looking composed in the face of a decision that could
backfire, recounted that Gascoigne cried after he told him the
news.
	   ``We had a chat for two or three minutes that lasted no longer
than that,'' Hoddle said. ``At the end of the day I think there
were some tears in his eyes.''
	   ``He went into his room. I think some of his friends went into
his room to console him. Paul acted as I would have expected him to
react.''
	   Gascoigne, a key figure when England reached the World Cup
semifinals in 1990 in Italy, returned to England after the shock
announcement and was reported staying with his estranged wife.
	   ``I can't believe this has happened. This is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me,'' The Sun newspaper quoted Gascoigne
as saying.
	   The unexpected gamble by Hoddle, the No. 1 news item Monday
across England, was surprisingly supported by more than 75 percent
of callers to a popular London morning radio show.
	   The story dwarfed news that Geri Halliwell was leaving the
English all-girls pop group the Spice Girls.
	   Gascoigne, who has played for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio,
Glasgow Rangers and Middlesbrough, seems to have lost the ability
to win games with his magical passing and dribbling. He has also
suffered numerous injuries and attracted the wrong kind of
publicity off the field.
	   Ankle and groin injuries sidelined him for much of last season
and, although he played 90 minutes of England's 0-0 tie with Saudi
Arabia and the 1-0 victory over Morocco on Wednesday, he managed
only half of the game against Belgium and limped off with a leg
injury.
	   In those three matches he looked ineffective, a shadow of the
creative player that made him a one-of-a-kind on previous English
sides.
	   Although Hoddle said he dropped Gascoigne over his lack of
fitness, he kept the faith with Les Ferdinand and Darren Anderton,
two Tottenham players who have been short on fitness and form this
season.
	   The move leaves England without a player with World Cup
experience. The club failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and reached the semifinals in 1990 in Italy.
	   Trevor Steven, Gascoigne's former England teammate, criticized
Hoddle's decision.
	   ``There's still two and a half weeks before kick off. Paul has
something that nobody else can offer the team and I would have just
given him that time.
	   ``As an England fan I would have loved to have seen him do well.
But the decision has been made and I think our squad is poorer for
the lack of Paul Gascoigne.''
	   The squad:
	   Goalkeepers _ David Seaman (Arsenal), Tim Flowers (Blackburn),
Nigel Martyn (Leeds),
	   Defenders _ Sol Campbell (Tottenham), Tony Adams (Arsenal),
Martin Keown (Arsenal), Rio Ferdinand (West Ham), Gareth Southgate
(Aston Villa), Gary Neville (Manchester United),
	   Midfielders _ Darren Anderton (Tottenham), David Beckham
(Manchester United), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Robert Lee
(Newcastle), Steve McManaman (Liverpool), Paul Ince (Liverpool),
David Batty (Newcastle), Paul Merson (Middlesbrough), Paul Scholes
(Manchester United),
	   Strikers _ Les Ferdinand (Tottenham), Alan Shearer (Newcastle),
Teddy Sheringham (Manchester United), Michael Owen (Liverpool).

New editor of Al-Hayat promises no change in paper's policies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The new editor-in-chief of the leading
Arabic daily Al-Hayat on Monday promised to continue its policy of
independent and fair journalism.
	   George Semaan, who assumed his post Sunday, wrote in today's
issue that the Saudi-owned paper will stay true to its policy of
``objectivity in news coverage and analysis.''
	   His statement came amid speculation that the paper's publisher,
Prince Khalid bin Sultan, was reorganizing the paper to promote a
more pro-Saudi stance.
	   Semaan said ``we will stick to our fixed principles of
independence and fairness'' in reporting.
	   Semaan, a journalist with Al-Hayat before the promotion, was
named as editor in March by the paper's publisher, Prince Khalid
bin Sultan. He takes over from Jihad al-Khazin, who edited the
prestigious daily for a decade.
	   Although the paper is owned by Saudis, most of its journalists
hail from other Arab countries _ mainly Lebanon. Two Lebanese
journalists were appointed as deputies to Semaan.
	   Former editor Al-Khazin will work as information adviser to
Al-Hayat's publishing company and will continue to write his daily
column in the paper.
	   Al-Hayat, first issued in Beirut in 1946, was forced to close
after its owner, Kamil Mroue, was assassinated in 1966. The paper
began publishing again from London in 1988.

Italian appeals trial begins for slaying of American boy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CATANZARO, Italy (AP) _ Prosecutors are trying a second time to
convict two Italian men of the 1994 highway slaying of a 7-year-old
American boy whose parents then donated his organs, inspiring a
country where donation rates are low.
	   The appeals trial began in this southern city Monday for the men
acquitted in January 1997 of slaying Nicholas Green during a
robbery attempt as he and his California family drove down a
Calabrian highway while on vacation.
	   The lower court jury had ruled there was no evidence to convict
Francesco Mesiano, 23, and Michele Iannello, 28, of murder,
attempted murder and armed robbery, but Italian law allows the
acquitted to be retried by an appeals court for the same crime.
	   Prosecutor Salvatore Murone told the court that since the first
trial a pistol was found in the house of Iannello's mother, and
that the discovery questioned the credibility of the defendant, who
had earlier testified he had no other weapons, the Italian news
agency AGI reported.
	   As Nicholas' father, Reginald Green, drove faster to try to
break away from the highway bandits, the boy, sleeping in the back
seat, was shot in the head and was declared brain-dead.
	   His parents donated his organs in an act that saved seven other
lives and inspired a temporary surge of organ donations in a
country where many relatives of accident victims, especially of
children, refuse to allow removal of organs.
	   Italy has one of the lowest donor rates in Europe.
	   Reginald Green testified in the first trial that he could not
identify the masked assailants.
	   Mesiano and Iannello had denied involvement in the death, even
though Iannello admitted to four gangland murders.
	   The prosecution said statements recorded by telephone taps
implicated the pair, but the defense disputed the meaning of the
conversations in dialect.
	   The appeals trial is expected to take about a week.

Amnesty International says Russian human rights violations persist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Serious human rights violations persist in Russia
despite President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of 1998 as Russia's
Year of Human Rights, Amnesty International said Monday.
	   Derek G. Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights
group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the
death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no
alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
	   ``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep
gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the
practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting
with Russian media.
	   Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it
joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel
Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with
the death penalty.
	   Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty
because it did not want the expense of providing for life
imprisonment for about 1,000 people. ``In other words, it is
cheaper to kill,'' he said.
	   Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious
objection to military service.
	   ``While the Russian Federation's Constitution guarantees this
right, no legislation has been enacted to create an alternative
civilian service of non-punitive length,'' Evans said.
	   He also said that civilian prisoners in pre-trial detention were
kept in conditions ``so severe as to constitute torture.''
	   Evans said Amnesty International has provided the government
with a preliminary analysis of the human rights situation in Russia
and some 51 proposals for meeting international standards.

Yugoslavia's twenty two-men World Cup roster now final 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav Coach Slobodan Santrac on
Monday dropped striker Anto Drobnjak and midfielder Albert Nadj
from Yugoslavia's 22-man World Cup squad.
	   Drobjak of French champion's Lens and Nadj of Betis, Spain, will
not travel to the tournament in France, where Yugoslavia faces the
United States, Germany and Iran in qualification Group S.
	   Nadj reportedly had a row with Santrac before Yugoslavia's
friendly warm-up with Nigeria last Friday which the Yugoslav team
won 3-0.
	   Nadj had allegedly refused to start the game on defense, rather
than his usual position in the midfield.
	   Santrac had a large choice of strikers and Drobnjak lost his
place in competition with Predrag Mijatovic and Darko Kovacevic.
	   ``It wasn't easy to shorten the list by two names,'' Santrac
told reporters Monday.
	   ``Nadj was not ready to play the position I intended for him and
Kovacevic had the advantage over Drobnjak, being both younger and
having completed the whole cycle of qualifications,'' he said.
	   Dragoslav Jevric was chosen as third goalie but will not travel
to France unless one of the two main goalkeepers is injured.
	   Santrac's final roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Ivica Kralj, Dragoje Lekovic.
	   Defense: Zoran Mirkovic, Goran Djorovic, Miroslav Djukic, Sinisa
Mihajlovic, Nisa Saveljic, Slobodan Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic.
	   Midfield: Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Savicevic, Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dejan Govedarica, Vladimir Jugovic, Miroslav Stevic, Branko
Brnovic, Dejan Stankovic, Ljubinko Drulovic.
	   Forwards: Predrag Mijatovic, Savo Milosevic, Darko Kovacevic,
Perica Ognjenovic.
	   The Yugoslav team left Monday for preparations in Switzerland,
on its way to France.

Spain gives final approval to extradition of Mexican banker 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with banker being extradited
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain on Monday extradited fugitive Mexican
banker Angel Rodriguez Saez, who fled his home country in 1994
after allegedly swindling banks out of dlrs 4 million.
	   Spanish police handed Rodriguez Saez over to their Mexican
counterparts at Madrid's Barajas airport where he boarded a midday
flight to Mexico City, said National Police spokesman Antonio
Nevada.
	   Rodriguez Saez, a flashy businessman known as ``El Divino'' _
The Divine One _ built a banking empire during the privatization of
the industry in Mexico in the early 1990s.
	   His Banpais entity, however, was taken over by regulatory
authorities in 1995 after they discovered capital shortfalls and
``irregularities'' in the bank's bookkeeping.
	   His extradition will make him the first major player in Mexico's
1994 banking and political scandals to be returned to his home
country.
	   Mexican officials have failed to win extradition of former
Assistant Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu from the United
States, while financier Carlos Cabal Peniche _ the most important
figure in the 1994 banking scandals _ is still at large.
	   Rodriguez Saez was arrested July 29, 1996, after he attempted to
flee Spanish police by diving off his yacht while sailing near the
Spanish Mediterranean island of Ibiza.
	   Despite successive appeals, Spanish judicial authorities agreed
to his extradition on February 22, 1998. On April 20, Rodriguez
Saez dropped his objections to the ruling.
	   The conservative Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar finally approved the extradition on May 22.

	   SAN MARINO (AP) _ The Christian Democrats and the Socialists,
who have governed this tiny, land-locked republic since 1993,
grabbed the largest share of the vote in parliamentary elections,
final results showed on Monday.
	   The Christian Democratic Party won 40 percent of the vote, while
the Socialists captured 23 percent, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   Some 22,670 percent voted on Sunday, or about 75 percent of the
30,000 eligible to vote.
	   Founded in the year 301, San Marino calls itself the world's
oldest republic, with an unbroken line of elected government
officials since at least 1244.
	   The 23-square-mile (60-square-kilometer) republic, located in
northeast Italy, depends on tourism, postage stamps and financial
services for income.

Police break ring smuggling stolen Canadian cars

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police arrested a dozen people and
impounded as many luxury vehicles in a crackdown on a ring
suspected of smuggling cars stolen in Canada, officials announced
Monday.
	   ``All the cars, brand new and at an average price of dlrs
60,000, have been stolen from car dealers or parking lots in Quebec
province,'' said Kiril Radev, head of a special police unit dealing
with organized crime.
	   Bulgarian police began the arrests last week, and still are
seeking the man believed to have masterminded the ring, 41-year-old
Hristo Ivanov Iliev. He is a Bulgarian who emigrated to Canada and
now has Canadian citizenship, Radev said.
	   Iliev is thought to be hiding somewhere in Bulgaria.
	   He had been convicted of theft three times before moving to
Canada in the 1970s, the state news agency BTA reported.
	   Canadian authorities have arrested an unspecified number of
suspects after being being contacted by Bulgarian police three days
ago, Radev said.
	   The seizure includes a Mercedes Benz 600 SEL, a Cadillac
Fleetwood, a Volvo G70, a Nissan Infinity and a Dodge Durango
four-wheel drive.
	   The cars were shipped in containers from the Canadian port of
Halifax to the Greek port of Piraeus, then transported to two
automobile dealers in Sofia. Two unnamed transport companies _ one
Canadian and one Bulgarian _ were involved.
	   Radev said smugglers falsified the cargo papers, saying the
containers were full of fiberglass. As transit freight, the sealed
containers wouldn't be opened by customs officers.
	   Radev didn't disclose how police were tipped to the smuggling
ring.
	   Some of the cars were slated for re-export to former Soviet
republics. Others were to be sold to Bulgarians who had made
deposits on the vehicles. The Bulgarians weren't aware of the
vehicles' origins, he said.
	   ``So far we have no evidence that the local car dealers realized
they were offered stolen cars,'' Radev said. Police still were
investigating, however, because only one of the cars had documents,
and those were fake.

Singapore gives death penalty for `ice' trafficking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Parliament imposed the death penalty on Monday
for trafficking in methamphetamine, and introduced corporal
punishment and long jail terms for repeat drug offenders.
	   When the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act are published in
a week or so, anyone convicted of dealing in more than 250 grams
(8.75 ounces) of methamphetamine, a designer drug known as ``ice,''
will go to the gallows.
	   Traffickers in 167-250 grams (5.85-8.75 ounces) of ``ice'' face
life in prison and 15 strokes of the cane, while lesser amounts are
punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
	   Singapore law automatically considers anyone possessing large
amounts of drugs as a trafficker. Under existing law, adults caught
with more than 15 grams (0.5 ounce) of heroin, 30 grams (1 ounce)
of morphine, half a kilo (1.1 pounds) of cannabis, or 1.2 kilograms
(2.6 pounds) of opium face the death penalty.
	   Also under the new law, users and dealers convicted a third time
will be imprisoned five to seven years and face three to six
strokes of the cane. Those found guilty of a further offense will
be jailed seven to 13 years and receive six to 12 strokes.
	   The tougher punishment ``is for these people who just simply
refuse to change,'' Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng argued in
Parliament. ``We have decided that the only way to treat these
addicts is to imprison them for a long time.''
	   The previous law dictated sentences of less than two years in
drug rehabilitation centers for repeat offenders.
	   The small Southeast Asian island republic has some of the
world's strictest drug laws. More than 180 people have been hanged
for drug trafficking since 1975, when the mandatory death penalty
was imposed.
	   Singapore no longer makes public the number of people hanged.

New budget addresses economic woes pickup.

Eds: UPDATES with Sinha introducing budget. ADDS byline. No
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's finance minister, who promised
firm action to deal with anti-nuclear sanctions that have battered
an already weak economy, introduced a budget Monday that included
increased spending in the infrastructure and nuclear energy
sectors.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government's commitment to
``swadeshi,'' which the BJP has defined as ``economic nationalism''
had worried foreign investors. But Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
said ``swadeshi does not mean isolation, swadeshi means making
India strong and self-reliant.''
	   Sinha said he believed the nuclear sanctions ``will not have any
significant impact on our economic development,'' in part because
he believed countries like the United States, Australia and Japan
who cut loans and all but humanitarian aid in the wake of India's
five nuclear tests last month would ``moderate'' their opposition
in time.
	   ``On our part, our policies have to be clearly directed and
firm,'' he said.
	   Sinha's government, presenting its first budget, has promised to
revive India's economic growth, which faltered to 5 percent in the
fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years.
Experts say that requires spending on infrastructure and
encouraging investment. His revenue options have been reduced by
the sanctions.
	   Sinha announced a 35 percent increase in spending on what he
called the key infrastructure areas of energy, transportation and
communications, and a 16 percent increase in allocations to the
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund, under which, among other
measures, farmers can obtain loans for expanding their enterprises.
The exact spending levels, and his plans for raising revenue, were
to be outlined later Monday.
	   Spending on developing nuclear energy _ an area that also has
defense ramifications _ was increased 68 percent, and for the space
department _ which has an important role in developing missiles
that could carry nuclear weapons _ 62 percent.
	   Minor concessions, likely to include tax breaks, were offered to
get Indians living abroad to invest in their homeland
	   He also promised a ``hassle-free procedure'' for foreign
investors who have complained that bureaucratic red tape presents a
huge obstacle to doing business in India.
	   The government's pre-budget economic assessment, presented to
Parliament last week, was bleak. In addition to the falling growth,
it said the deficit rose to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product,
the total value of goods and services produced by the economy,
exceeding the target of 4.5 percent.
	   A 6.35 percent inflation rate was reported Sunday, up from 5
percent during 1997-1998.
	   The full impact of the nuclear sanctions was yet unclear, but
they were already having a chilling effect.
	   The rupee slid last week when Standard and Poor's financial
rating agency revised its India rating outlook to negative from
stable. A few days later, the World Bank postponed consideration of
more than dlrs 800 million in development loans to India because of
its nuclear tests, prompting a further slide in the rupee.
	   The rupee opened at 41.74 to the U.S. dollar Monday; it was
39.73 at the beginning of May.

Parents of Israeli MIA to examine captured Israeli tank in Moscow 
</HEADLINE>
By MASHA HERBST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The father of an Israeli MIA said Monday he
would go to Russia, accompanied by a forensics expert, to examine
an Israeli tank on display at a Moscow military museum for evidence
of human remains.
	   The soldier, Zachary Baumel, along with the other members of the
three-man tank crew, went missing after a battle with the Syrian
army at Sultan Yakoub in Lebanon on June 11, 1982.
	   An Israeli tank which was identified as having been captured at
Sultan Yakoub is now being kept at the Moscow military museum.
Russian media reported last month that the tank contained the
remains of Israeli soldiers, but that has been denied by the
Russian government.
	   The Israeli army confirmed Monday that the tank on display in
Moscow was captured at Sultan Yakoub, but said all its crew members
survived the 1982 war and were back in Israel.
	   Baumel's father, Yona, on Monday met with the Russian ambassador
to Israel, Mikhail Bogdanov. The ambassador told Baumel that he
would make arrangements for Baumel and his wife, Miriam, to fly to
Moscow this summer, accompanied by a forensics expert, and gain
access to the museum which has been closed since the news reports
on the alleged human remains in the tank.
	   The forensics expert would examine the tank for any remains that
would make possible DNA testing, Baumel told The Associated Press.
The Baumels, who moved to Israel from New York in 1970, made
tentative plans to fly to Moscow in July.

Ethiopian and Eritrean troops clash at border area 
</HEADLINE>
By ABEBE ANDUALEM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopian and Eritrean troops have
clashed in a disputed border area, and both sides suffered an
undetermined number of casualties, a reliable source said Monday.
	   The source, who could not be further identified, said the clash
took place early Sunday near the village of Alitena in the
foothills of the Asimba Mountains, about 600 kilometers (372 miles)
north of Addis Ababa.
	   A reporter for the Amharic language service of the Voice of
America who was in the region said she heard artillery fire
throughout the day Sunday.
	   According to the source, the clash area is located 20 kilometers
(12 miles) inside Ethiopian territory.
	   Since its first public comment on the border dispute May 13,
Ethiopia has repeatedly claimed that Eritreans have made incursions
into Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea denies the claims and has suggested international
mediation. Ethiopia rejects direct negotiations until Eritrea
withdraws and threatened to use force if it did not.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice
returned to Addis Ababa Sunday evening and will continue
``facilitating dialogue,'' a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Rice spent a week shuttling between Addis Ababa and the Eritrean
capital, Asmara, after Ethiopia first accused Eritrea of border
violations.
	   A State Department team remained in the region, meeting with
officials from both nations as well as from Djibouti, the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the
Organization of African Unity.
	   The State Department issued a second travel advisory Friday
warning American citizens to stay away from the border regions and
has pulled U.S. government employees and Peace Corps volunteers
away from border areas in Eritrea.
	   In a speech Monday in Nairobi, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
a former chairman of IGAD, expressed concern over the rising
tension between the two countries and said he was already
coordinating between current IGAD chairmain President Hassan Gouled
Aptidon of Djibouti and other parties ``to settle this problem in a
peaceful manner.''
	   Although no figures have been made public, military sources in
Eritrea say at 200,000 Eritreans _ including regular army, veterans
and youths doing cumpulsory military service _ have been mobilized
since May 13.
	   On Friday, staff at Asmara University were asked to contribute
10 percent of their monthly salaries to the mobilization effort.
	   Eritrea has an estimated population of 3.67 million, compared to
about 57 million in Ethiopia.
	   Seven years ago, Eritrean and Ethiopian rebels forces united to
overthrow Ethiopia's 17-year military regime in 1991. Two years
later, Eritrea gained independence.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrea is illegally occupying a 400-sq.
km. (160-sq.-mile) area known as the Yigra triangle in northwestern
Ethiopia as well as other areas in the northeast.
	   Eritrea says that according to the Italian colonial boundaries
that are still binding, the areas are Eritrean.
	   In the past five years, Eritrea has had border disputes with
Sudan and Djibouti as well as with Yemen over control of the Hanish
Islands in the Red Sea. The International Tribunal in The Hague is
expected to decide that dispute in July.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; hundreds flee 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in Serbia's explosive
Kosovo province prompted reports Monday of more than a dozen new
deaths and sent hundreds of people fleeing into Albania.
	   Conflicting accounts of casualties in the blocked-off areas
could not immediately be sorted out. But the bloodshed appears to
be the worst since early March when Serbian police killed more than
80 people in a crackdown on militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 33 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while six were killed
when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died of their wounds in the fighting
around Decani, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional
capital Pristina, Serb sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 1,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital Tirana that the refugees, many of whom had walked for as
many as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a
school. Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   Authorities in Serbia, which along with Montenegro comprises all
that remains of the Yugoslav federation, claim that thousands of
Kosovo Albanians are staying in the province illegally.
	   They are trying to block Kosovo's independence bid and are using
the police and army to try to crush militants and maintain control
over the province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million is ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the six people it said were
killed Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterwards, Serb police allegedly set several homes ablaze after
dousing them in gasoline.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hotspots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday blamed ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' for numerous deaths. It said that in
their efforts to cross into Albania, they shelled several villages
near Junik, ``a border town known for resisting militant
enlistings, killing several of their countrymen, including
children.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens read ``canceled'' in bright red
letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine days before the
soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 teams, sat idle at
terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts aimed at
keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of the red.
	   It was a serious embarrassment to the leftist government of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and train workers were also
threatening to strike later in the week.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   Under normal circumstances, around 100,000 people would have
used Air France on Monday.
	   Air France assured that it would make good on its commitment to
fly World Cup teams.
	   But the airline expected to cancel 90 percent of long-haul
flights for the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are
likely to fly as planned, the company has said, as are about 20
percent leaving from Orly airport, in south Paris.
	   During the World Cup, fans will travel across France regularly
since their teams will rotate between several venues. In addition,
there are 9,000 journalists accredited to cover the event.

Indonesian corruption probe to include Suharto businesses 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Authorities have launched an
investigation into government corruption under ex-President
Suharto, the attorney general said Monday.
	   The broadly-based inquiry is expected to encompass business
dealings by Suharto's family, which critics say used its
connections to make billions of dollars from a wide range of
industries during his three decades in power.
	   However, the investigation's general focus is likely to
disappoint many Indonesians who have been loudly calling for a fast
probe to target the Suharto family's wealth specifically.
	   ``The investigation is underway,'' Attorney General Sudjono
Atmonegoro said at a news conference. ``This investigation is a
process that will need time. It cannot be completed in just one or
two days.''
	   Sudjono said the inquiry was the government response to calls
for an investigation into the conduct of ``government officials.''
He did not specifically name Suharto.
	   Critics say nepotism, corruption and cronyism that thrived under
Suharto contributed in large part to Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   Suharto quit May 21 following riots over price increases and
under pressure from student protesters who occupied Parliament.
	   A leading opposition figure has called on Suharto to donate the
bulk of his wealth back to the country.
	   Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader, said that with the money
Indonesia would not have to beg for assistance from international
agencies to prop up the economy.
	   Sudjono said the corruption inquiry would be carried out on the
principle of ``presumption of innocence'' and would involve many
government departments and outside agencies.
	   As part of the probe, Sudjono said he had received guarantees
from Suharto family members that they would not leave Indonesia.
	   ``There have been guarantees from them that they will not leave
our beloved country,'' he said.
	   He said there were no plans to question Suharto, although the
former president might be asked to check evidence from others, at a
later stage.
	   The head of the powerful military, Gen. Wiranto said recently he
was opposed to a specific investigation into the Suharto family
fortune, saying that it could only worsen national disunity.
	   The military played a key role in Indonesia's recent political
crisis. It quelled riots by putting thousands of soldiers and
dozens of tanks on the street.
	   Some claim it also was instrumental in persuading Suharto,
himself a retired army general, to quit in favor of new President
B.J. Habibie, a civilian and Suharto loyalist who has promised
political and economic reforms.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ A top official of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission on Monday indirectly blamed former
President P.W. Botha for the killings of black activists during
apartheid.
	   Botha is on trial for ignoring a summons to appear before the
Truth Commission, which is probing apartheid-era human rights
abuses. But the trial _ the first ever of a former South African
head of state _ has focused on Botha's role as chairman of the
State Security Council, which coordinated a security crackdown on
black liberation groups. The trial resumed Monday after being
postponed for six weeks.
	   Truth Commission executive secretary Paul van Zyl said minutes
from State Security Council meetings contained words like
``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' when referring to opponents of
white rule. Botha headed the security council when he was head of
state.
	   ``It is quite clear from these documents, as we interpret it,
the word eliminate means kill,'' van Zyl said.
	   In showing why it wants to question Botha, the commission has
presented the court in this southern coastal town with dozens of
documents implicating Botha, who led South Africa from 1978-1989,
in atrocities.
	   Van Zyl said the Security Council had been briefed in 1979 about
plans to launch overseas operations against members of the African
National Congres, including sending bombs in the mail.
	   Wearing a dark suit and foregoing a cane which he has normally
used since undergoing a hip replacement last year, Botha sat
impassively as he listened to the testimony.
	   Botha, 82, had greeted a handful supporters as he entered the
court, located near the village where he has retired.
	   Talks have restarted on a possible deal to avoid continuation of
the trial. The Truth Commission says it is still willing to try and
drop the contempt charges against Botha if he appears at a special
Truth Commission hearing.
	   Botha has pleaded innocent to the charges. He says he has
already given the commission 1,700 pages of written answers and
says the panel only wants to humiliate him by forcing him to appear
in person.
	   He faces two years imprisonment and unspecified fines if
convicted.

Portugal sets up council to crack down on child labor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government Monday announced the
creation of a national council to crack down on child labor,
estimated to involve some 50,000 children in this country of 10
million.
	   Describing child labor as ``a worrying fact,'' Employment
Minister Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues said the council will include
representatives from trade unions, employers, the government and
civic institutions. Its chief task will be to monitor and recommend
action.
	   Stamping out child labor will require cultural and social
changes, as well as cooperation between public entities, Ferro
Rodrigues said.
	   The General Confederation of Portuguese Workers estimates that
almost 50,000 children under the age of 16 are working in Portugal
_ about the same as a decade ago.
	   Most of the children work in the construction and textile
industries in the north of the country, the confederation said.
	   Government figures do not give overall estimates, but last year
167 cases of child labor were detected by the General Labor
Inspectorate in a survey of 26,424 workers.

Sempati Air, owned by Suharto son, closes because of weak rupiah 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's third largest airline,
controlled by ex-President Suharto's youngest son, closed down
Monday, crippled by the collapse of the rupiah, the government
said.
	   ``Because current conditions are so heavy, it is not possible
for Sempati to continue its operations and activities,'' said
Transportation Minister Giri Suseno Hardi Hardjono.
	   Indonesia's airlines have registered enormous losses because of
Asia's economic crisis and the weak rupiah, which has lost more
than 70 percent of its value since July 1997.
	   Most of them, including national airline Garuda, have
drastically cut services.
	   Much of the costs borne by the airlines are in dollars but their
revenue is mainly in rupiah.
	   Sempati's shareholders include Suharto's son Hutomo ``Tommy''
Mandala Putra as well as a military foundation. The airline, which
operated mostly on domestic routes with several international
destinations, is run by Tommy.
	   An economic crisis, riots and student unrest induced Suharto to
resign on May 21 after 32 years of autocratic rule. Since then, a
groundswell of support has built for the government to try and
recover billions of dollars his family allegedly siphoned off the
economy through corruption and nepotism.
	   The government has already canceled many contracts with firms
linked to the former first family, and on Monday announced it has
launched an investigation of government corruption under his rule.
	   Indonesia's attorney general said investigators have no plans to
target the former leader, but will look into business dealings of
his family.
	   As part of the general investigation, Attorney General Sudjono
Atmonegoro said he had received guarantees from Suharto's family
members that they would not leave Indonesia.

Bangkok plans bounty for those bringing dogs for neutering 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seeking to control the burgeoning
population of stray dogs, Bangkok city officials have decided to
pay residents 50 baht (dlrs 1.22) for each dog they bring in for
neutering at public health centers.
	   The policy was announced at a public hearing attended by 300
people on the question of how to control strays, Supong Limtanakul,
an advisor to the city's governor, said Monday.
	   The incentive would be paid for both people's pets and any
strays they might bring in, he said. But the bounty would be paid
only for female dogs of puppy-bearing age.
	   Supong estimated that there are as many as 1 million stray dogs
in the capital alone.
	   He said the hearing was held because of complaints from joggers
as well as foreigners who visited Buddhist temples, which
traditionally shelter stray dogs. The foreigners' complaints could
have a negative impact on tourism, he noted.
	   He said some animal lovers at the hearing suggested the city
government provide a budget to feed the strays, while others _
including relatives of dog-bite victims who had succumbed to rabies
_ wanted to get the strays off the city's streets altogether.
	   Last year about 80 people died of rabies, 10 of them in Bangkok,
Supong said.
	   ``Stray dogs is not the problem, the problem is people, people
who have no responsibility,'' he said, noting that people abandon
their canine pets at temples when they grow up, have too many
puppies, or simply cease being cute.
	   He also said the city is considering an idea to implant
microchips in dogs which would contain their owners' names and
other information.
	   The scheme, to cost about 100 baht (dlrs 2.44) per dog, would
help make owners more responsible because they could be traced, and
also could be used to see whether a dog who bit someone had been
vaccinated, he said.

Settlers launch campaign to turn public against pullback 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers mailed one million brochures to
Israeli homes Monday in hopes of turning public opinion against a
U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank.
	   The campaign came as Israel's Cabinet again failed to reach a
decision on the scope of the pullback. The United States reportedly
wants an Israeli answer within the next few days. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu initially said he could hand over no more than 9
percent without compromising Israel's security, but media reports
said Monday he was considering a larger pullback.
	   The brochures sent out by the Jewish Settlers' Council warned
that a 13 percent pullback would endanger Israel's water resources,
its hold over Jerusalem and its control over holy sites as well as
jeopardize the future of the 144 Jewish settlements.
	   ``We can not surrender to American pressure!'' the brochure said
in bold letters.
	   Aharon Dombe, a settler spokesman, said the campaign cost 1.5
shekels (dlrs 405,000) and was paid for by supporters.
	   Netanyahu last year committed to three troop pullbacks in the
West Bank, but none have been carried because of disagreement with
the Palestinians over the scope of each withdrawal.
	   A majority of Israelis support the land-for-peace negotiations
with the Palestinians, according to various surveys.

Gadhafi to visit Egypt for talks on trade, investment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is making a
nine-day visit to Egypt starting Tuesday that will focus on trade
relations with Egypt and likely will touch on Libya's feud with the
West over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner.
	   Gadhafi's visit to Egypt, the second in two years, can be
expected to upset the United States, which has sought to isolate
Libya because of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Banned from international flights under United Nations
sanctions, Gadhafi is expected to travel by land over the
Libyan-Egyptian border to the town of Saloum and then go on to
Cairo.
	   He will be arriving with an entourage including nine ministers
and a team of businessmen. The team will discuss potential Libyan
investments in Egypt, especially in the vast Toshka irrigation
project in southern Egypt.
	   The two countries are to sign seven trade, investment and
manufacturing agreements, according to Egyptian news reports. The
Libyans want to boost trade with Egypt, which now officially totals
492 million Egyptian pounds (dlrs 144 million) annually.
	   Despite U.S. complaints, Egypt has sought to maintain good
relations with its oil-rich neighbor. Gadhafi is likely to raise
the Lockerbie issue in talks scheduled Tuesday with President Hosni
Mubarak.
	   Lockerbie will also be on his agenda with Arab League Secretary
General Esmet Abdel-Meguid, who is to meet with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on June 14.
	   Both the United States and England have sought to isolate Libya
because of Gadhafi's failure to turn over for trial two Libyans
charged with the Lockerbie bombing. Gadhafi says they cannot get a
fair trial in either country and wants them tried in a neutral
state.
	   In an effort to force Libya to turn over the suspects, the U.N.
Security Council imposed sanctions in March 1992 that ban
international air travel, refuse arms sales to Libya and call for
limiting diplomatic contacts with the country.

Wild gunfire greets victory by Milosevic foe

Eds: UPDATES with newer vote count.
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Wild gunfire erupted in downtown
Monday as revelers celebrated the victory in Montenegro's
parliamentary elections of the biggest challenger to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   With 94.2 percent of the vote counted, the Election Commission
in the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics said Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic's coalition had captured 49.5 percent of
the ballots compared to 36 percent for Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic.
	   The Montenegrin separatist Liberal Alliance _ the only other
party to clear the 3 percent vote threshold to get into parliament
_ received 6.2 percent of the vote.
	   Announcing those returns, commission chairman Stevan Damjanovic
said votes from 40 polling stations, where about 26,000 voters were
registered, were still not counted.
	   He expected those results to be in by Monday evening but said
voting would have to be repeated in two polling stations on
Wednesday, delaying an absolutely final count until later in the
week.

Williams-Hingis rivalry renewed at French Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Venus Williams slammed the serve at 185 kph (115
mph, but Ai Sugiyama held up her hand and watched the ball speed
past. The umpire ordered the point replayed.
	   Williams glared at her opponent with a look that seemed to
scream, ``Are you ready NOW?'' Then the 17-year-old American
responded with a 190 kph (118 mph) service winner.
	   That may be the question for top-seeded Martina Hingis as she
prepares to play Williams in the quarterfinals of the French Open
on Tuesday, their fifth encounter already this year.
	   The rivalry between Hingis and Williams is becoming one of the
best in women's sports. Though it evokes hints of the Chris
Evert-Martina Navratilova duels of the 1980s, it has the potential
to become much more bitter off the court.
	   Hingis becomes downright haughty when discussing Williams, whom
she says has not yet earned the right to consider herself part of a
great rivalry.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
said. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
tournament on clay, responded diplomatically when told of Hingis'
comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, including a 6-0, 6-4
win in the final of the U.S. Open last summer in their only
previous Grand Slam meeting.
	   They are 2-2 this year, with Williams winning on hard courts in
Sydney and in the semifinals of the Lipton Championships in Key
Biscayne. But Hingis won their only career encounter on clay,
capturing the final of the Italian Open in three sets in mid-May.
	   ``It was a good victory for me there to beat her in three sets
in the final of a big tournament,'' Hingis said. ``I hope she will
remember that, too.''
	   Hingis and Williams have eased through the first four rounds of
the French Open. Hingis has lost just 14 games while averaging 56
minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and averaged 58
minutes per match.
	   Hingis said she has every reason to feel she has an edge over
Williams heading into the match.
	   ``Well, why shouldn't I?'' she asked. ``I'm No. 1, I've won four
Grand Slams. I have the self-confidence.''
	   While Hingis is the master strategist, moving opponents around
the court with precise groundstrokes until she has set up a winning
shot, Williams relies on power and athleticism to overwhelm foes.
	   Those contrasting styles bring back memories of Evert, the
baseline strategist, and Navratilova, the powerful
serve-and-volleyer. They enjoyed their on-court duels and an
off-court friendship.
	   But the Hingis-Williams matchup is not a friendly rivalry and,
if Hingis is to be believed, not yet even a rivalry.
	   All that could change on Tuesday.

	   THOUSANDS of pro-democracy activists held a protest on Sunday to
mark the ninth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen crackdown, the
first under Chinese rule.
	   But on the mainland, police temporarily detained about 20
dissidents from the eastern Shandong province and also warned
another 10 not to leave their homes ahead of the annual
demonstration over the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, a banned
opposition party said.
	   In Hong Kong, an estimated 3,000 demonstrators, carrying black
and white banners, demanded the mainland government revise its
verdict on the brutal military crackdown.
	   The protesters marched from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to the
SAR Government Headquarters, but unlike previous years they did not
pass the offices of the Xinhua News Agency.
	   They chanted slogans calling for the release of all dissidents
on the mainland and for democracy and human rights.
	   The radical April Fifth Action Group carried a symbolic coffin
with the slogan ``a political power that kills stinks for 10,000
years'', and put it outside the foreign ministry's Office of the
Commissioner.
	   The group carried banners and chanted slogans demanding the
resignation of President Jiang Zemin and National People's Congress
Chairman Li Peng, who they hold directly responsible for the
massacre.
	   A police spokesman said no arrests were made.
	   The protesters later said they hoped their demonstration
yesterday on Chinese soil could pave the way for more freedom to
demonstrate on the mainland.
	   Cheung Yiu-tong, a volunteer with the Hong Kong Alliance for the
Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, said: ``Now
that we are under Chinese rule it is a lot more meaningful for Hong
Kong people to fight for democracy in China.'' Other demonstrators
were worried the Hong Kong government had plans to curb their
ability to hold protests in the future.
	   Alliance general secretary Albert Ho Chun-yan, a newly elected
legislator, said he feared a new law would be passed during the
next session of the Legislative Council on sedition and subversion
to limit protests.

New budget addresses economic woes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS defense spending increased, taxes steady. No pickup.
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's finance minister, who promised
firm action to deal with anti-nuclear sanctions that have battered
an already weak economy, introduced a budget Monday that included
more spending on infrastructure, defense and nuclear energy.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha also offered reassurance to
foreign businesses, whose investment he will need to jump-start
India's economy.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government's commitment to
``swadeshi,'' which the BJP defined as ``economic nationalism''
worried foreign investors. Sinha said ``swadeshi does not mean
isolation, swadeshi means making India strong and self-reliant.''
	   Sinha said he believed the nuclear sanctions ``will not have any
significant impact on our economic development,'' in part because
he believed countries like the United States, Australia and Japan
who cut loans and all but humanitarian aid after India's five
nuclear tests last month would ``moderate'' their opposition in
time.
	   ``On our part, our policies have to be clearly directed and
firm,'' he said.
	   The new government, presenting its first budget, has promised to
revive India's economic growth, which faltered to 5 percent in the
fiscal year 1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years.
	   Sinha announced 611 billion rupees (dlrs 1.5 billion), a 35
percent increase, would be spent on what he called the key
infrastructure areas of energy, transportation and communications.
	   He also announced a hike of about 51 billion rupees (dlrs 1.2
billion), or about 14 percent, on defense. Military experts have
said much of the defense budget, which has been declining in recent
years, goes to maintaining conventional weapons.
	   ``There can be no compromise in defense preparedness,'' Sinha
said as lawmakers thumped their desks in appreciation.
	   To tap the financial capacity of the millions of Indians living
abroad, Sinha offered them educational, cultural and economic
concessions. He did not give details.
	   He also promised a ``hassle-free procedure'' for foreign
investors who have complained that bureaucratic red tape presents a
huge obstacle to doing business in India.
	   In a significant move, Sinha said he will open the
government-owned insurance sector to competition from private
Indian companies. He did not say foreign insurance companies would
be allowed in.
	   The government said it would sell off its interest in Indian
Airlines and several state-owned energy companies to raise funds.
But individual and corporate taxes were to remain steady because,
Sinha said, consistency in this area was needed to encourage
Indians to pay.
	   The previous government cut tax rates from 15 percent to 10
percent for those earning between 60,000 and 100,000 rupees (dlrs
1,540 to dlrs 2,560); from 30 to 20 for those earning between
100,000 and 150,000 rupees (dlrs 2,560 to dlrs 3,850); and from 40
to 30 for those earning more than 150,000 rupees (dlrs 3,850).
Those earning less than 60,000 rupees (dlrs 1,540) pay no taxes.
	   Sinha repeated the previous finance minister's argument that
Indians would be more likely to pay their taxes if they were not
burdensome. And, like the previous minister, he promised a
crackdown on evaders.
	   ``In a country of our size, it's a matter of great anxiety that
the total number of taxpayers constitutes less than 1.25 percent of
our population,'' he said.
	   Sinha said he decided to hold firm on taxes despite a great
temptation to raise them.
	   The government's pre-budget economic assessment, presented to
Parliament last week, was bleak. In addition to the falling growth,
it said the deficit rose to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product,
the total value of goods and services produced by the economy,
exceeding the target of 4.5 percent.
	   A 6.35 percent inflation rate was reported Sunday, up from 5
percent during 1997-1998.

	   THE property market has perked up, with transactions almost
trebling just days after the government announced a package of
measures to stabilise prices.
	   Real-estate agents on Sunday said the lifting of
anti-speculation measures and the pledge to boost liquidity for
banks to assist homebuyers has rekindled buyer sentiment.
	   ``After Mr Tung's announcement on Friday, total transactions
have jumped two to three times higher than before,'' said Louis
Chan, director of Centaline Property.
	   But not everybody was happy _ more than 200 buyers of pre-sale
flats marched in Central on Sunday to protest against measures they
said were of no use to them.
	   They marched from Statue Square to the SAR Government
Headquarters waving banners and chanting slogans: ``Step down,
Chief Executive'' and ``Chief Executive is in good shape but we are
in poor shape''.
	   Although transactions have risen, prices have not changed, Mr
Chan said.
	   Chi Cheung Property director Ivan Lo Chi-kai said the measures
would stabilise the primary market and, as a result, the
second-hand one as well.
	   ``Tierra Verde and the remaining units of other new projects
would benefit the most from these measures,'' he said.
	   The measures, according to Mr Lo, would enable developers to
establish a flexible sales policy.
	   Buyers fear they might be left out if developers were given more
flexibility and could opt not to rush in to sell their flats.
	   Choi Ai Min, managing director of Hong Kong Property, said the
measures marked the government's determination to manage the supply
of residential flats in a flexible manner.
	   In addition, prices of first-hand properties have already
bottomed, so the prices in the second-hand market will stabilise
shortly.
	   Midland Realty managing director Cheung Kam-shing said the
satisfactory results of the sale of Tierra Verde was good for
market in the short term.
	   He expected transactions in the first and second-hand market
this month to be 20 and 30 per cent higher, respectively.
	   ``Property in Tsing Yi, as affected by Tierra Verde, has
obviously stabilised,'' Mr Cheung said.
	   But he said investors should not be too optimistic as the
government measures were short-term and intended only to stabilise
the current market.
	   Yesterday's demonstrators mostly claimed to have bought property
last year as the market reached its peak.
	   They said the measures unveiled on Friday came too late,
claiming the prices of their units had plunged 30-40 per cent.
	   A Mrs Wu, 70, burst into tears during the demonstration and
wailed: ``I have lost all my savings.'' The unit she and her sons
purchased last May was in May Wood Court (Kingswood Villa).
	   ``When we bought the unit last year, it was worth $2.8 million
but now the banks estimate it to be worth less than $2 million,''
her son said.

Dismissal of Kenya wildlife director blocked dlrs 400 million 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ David Western, fired by the government,
returned to the helm of the Kenya Wildlife Service because donor
countries withdrew critical financial support, a newspaper said
Monday.
	   A day after Western was fired on May 21, European donors
canceled dlrs 400 million in aid earmarked for salaries and other
crucial expenditures within the wildlife service, The East African,
a respected weekly reported.
	   Government and diplomatic offices were closed for a holiday, and
could not be reached for comment.
	   The cash-strapped, government-owned wildlife service has been
working closely with organizations including the World Bank,
coordinator of the Protected Areas Wildlife Service program, the
European Union, and British, Dutch, German and U.S. development
agencies.
	   Sources, who were not identified, told the newspaper the
decision to withhold funding was made soon after Western complained
at a news conference was ousted because he resisted ministerial
pressure to allow more mines in one park and to reallocate parts of
other parks for private use.
	   President Daniel arap Moi dismissed Western's allegations as
``cheap.'' Nonetheless, the government on Thursday extended
Western's contract until the end of the year ``so that proper
arrangements may be made for a takeover by (a new) director.''
	   The government has not explained why Western was dismissed nor
why his contract was extended.
	   On Friday, donors released dlrs 180 million to the wildlife
service. Hit by a devastating slump in tourism due to political
violence and floods, the wildlife service has been forced to make
massive layoffs and huge spending cuts.
	   Western has said he was pleased with his reinstatement, though
it cuts short his tenure by a year.
	   ``It will enable him to oversee the implementation of the
ongoing restructuring exercise at KWS, and allow him to pursue
funding options from both government and donors,'' the wildlife
service said in a statement issued on Western's behalf.
	   Western has held the post for more than four years.
	   Western's predecessor, Richard Leakey, resigned twice within
days in 1994, complaining of nepotism and corruption. He rejected a
presidential order to resume his duties.

	   In a noble move to help the elderly people and remove poverty
from rural areas of the country, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today
launched the old age allowance programme.
	   ``We are determined to remove all sorts of discrimination,
exploitation, poverty and hunger from the society,'' she said
before handing over the pass hooks of the allowance programme to
the elderly people of Tungipara thana.
	   The government has undertaken the humanitarian programme to help
the aged but poor people of the country as per political commitment
of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
	   Under the programme, 10 old distressed people from an ward that
means 90 people from each union will receive Tk 100 each per month.
	   Meanwhile, the government has enlisted some 4,03,110 people,
including 50 per cent women, from 4,479 unions under 461 thanas of
the country to bring them under the scheme.
	   On the inaugural day of the countrywide programme, nearly 450
old people of Tungipara thana received their allowances.
	   The Prime Minister handed over pass books, allowance of two
months and conveyance Tk 20 to 60 old men of the area to inaugurate
the noble programme.
	   ``I pray for her so that she can help more poor like us .. .. I
pray for her every success in her every effort,'' said Kasem
Sikder, a 75-year old man after receiving the first installment of
his life long allowance.
	   Kasem, a father of three sons, came from nearby Bhagerkul
village, said his sons give him foods, ``but that is not always
enough for me''.
	   ``I am very much happy as I have been able to take the chance to
receive the money from the Prime Minister herself.. ..from now on I
will buy an adequate amount of food for me,'' said a beaming Kasem
wearing a blur lanced obstacles.
	   Bijoy Krishna Mandal, aged about 80, came from Patgati village
to receive the allowance. He said, ``I pray for the 'Bangamata'
(mother of Bengal) so that she can serve thousands other poor
people.''
	   Shashi Charan Mandal, seemed to be 80 years old, said he will
spend the money for treatment of his eyes. ``I will buy medicine
for my eyes as I have become almost blind,'' said the old man
hailing from Chingari.
	   ``May Allah save our Prime Minister as she can do more for our
people,'' prayed the old man, a father of two sons and three
daughters.
	   Fulmala Biswas, a sixty-year old woman, also hailing from
Patgati village, said she will buy cloths and medicine for herself
by the money.
	   ``For a long time I could not buy medicine for want of money
although I have been suffering from various diseases,'' said
Fulmala in a jubilant mood. ``Now I will consult a doctor and buy
medicine.''
	   Another sexagenarian woman Devrani Roy said she had lost her
only son in the Liberation War, but now there is none to look after
her. ``I am just pulling on my life with the help of my
neighbours,'' she said adding that the money will help her a lot.
	   Earlier, addressing the gathering of the old men and women at
the Thana complex premises, the Prime Minister said the government
has taken up such a programme so that the neglected rural poor can
be benefited directly.
	   ``We are trying to help a little those poorest of the poor who
feel neglected during the last days of their lives as they are
considered burden of the society,'' she said.
	   The money, even though a very little, will help them raise their
status in the family and society, and make them feel that they are
still important, Hasina said.
	   ``This will have a positive impact on poverty alleviation
programmes of the government,'' she said adding that the main
target of the present government is to build up a poverty and
hunger free nation by ensuring a better life for the downtrodden.
	   Hasina said Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman was assassinated at a time when he started working for
economic emancipation of the people.
	   ``Now as the follower of the ideals of Bangabandhu I have
started various programmes to ensure economic freedom of the
people,'' she said. ``If we can bring back smile on face of the
downtrodden, the soul of Bangabandhu will get peace.''
	   The old aged allowance programme was inaugurated on the death
anniversary of the mother of Bangabandhu, Sayera Khatun.
	   ``We have started this noble programme on the death anniversary
of such a great lady who gave birth to the Father of the Nation,''
the Prime Minister said.
	   She said Bangabandhu had fought throughout his life for
establishing rights of the people and also sacrificed his life for
the people of the country.
	   ``Being the daughter of Bangabandhu, I'm also ready to sacrifice
everything for the countrymen,'' the Prime Minister said seeking
blessings from the people so that she can fight for the poor.
	   Finance Minister SAMS Kibria, State Minister for Social Welfare
Dr Mozammel Hossain, Gopalganj district Awami League general
secretary Sheikh Abdullah, Social Welfare Secretary Nurul Abedin,
DG of Social Welfare Directorate Meer Shahabuddin and Gopalganj DC
Nasiruddin also spoke on the occasion.
	   From the programme the Prime Minister went straight to her
ancestral home and offered fateha at the Mazar of Bangabandhu and
the Mazars of Bangabandhu's father Sheikh Lutfur Rahman and mother
Sayera Khatun.
	   Later, a milad mahfil was held at the mazar premises of the
Father of the Nation, which was attended, among others, by the
Finance Minister, Awami League leader Abdul Mannan, Col (retd)
Farrok Khan MP, Sheikh Helal Unddin MP and local people.

	   PREMIER Zhu Rongji has ordered a more intensive war on
corruption after nation-wide investigations into financial
institutions uncovered far more irregularities than expected.
	   In Guangdong alone, bad debts and non-performing loans were
found to have increased substantiallly since early this year _ in
spite of widespread awareness of the dangers posed by such
irregularities in light of the regional financial crisis.
	   Worse, more irregularities were found during the detailed
scrutiny of the province's banks and other financial institutions.
	   Similar discoveries have been made in other provinces, leading
to the growing view that the mainland's true situation is worse
than expected.
	   Initial reports suggest that many state corporations based in
the coastal regions have invested heavily in Southeast Asia. While
known, the extent is only now coming to light.
	   It is likely to lead to a thorough re-assessment of the impact
of the regional crisis on the mainland.
	   These discoveries have led Mr Zhu to order more intensive
investigations and more severe punishments.
	   It is understood that officials will be kicked out and barred
from the civil service, no matter how minor their misdeeds, a
mainland source said, quoting a recent speech by Mr Zhu that was
recently circulated internally.
	   Mr Zhu has also urged the media to give publicity to all such
misdeeds in the crucial business sector.
	   He also encouraged journalists to direct more energy and
criticism to the war on graft and the crackdown on irregularities.
	   Central investigators were asked to work closely with the media.
	   ``We should mobilise all the forces in the society in the fight
against these evils, especially those wrongdoings in the financial
and banking sectors, which are crucial to a healthy and stable
economic development,'' he said, pointing out that corruption,
cronyism and irregularities are key reasons behind economic
collapses in neighbouring countries.
	   He said it was not enough to rely solely on law enforcement
bodies.
	   A Guangdong official, admitting more instances of serious
irregularities have been uncovered, said officials in the whole
province have become fidgety as a result.

	   BNP yesterday ridiculed the claim of LGRD Minister Zillur
Rahman's that 50 more BNP MPs are waiting for joining the consensus
government'.
	   ``It's a wishful thinking, tissue of imagination'', said Abdul
Mannan Bhuiyan reacting to the statement of Zillur Rahman who is
also General Secretary of the ruling party.
	   Mannan said it is not possible for Awami League to make so many
BNP MPs ministers. ``Why they will go'', he posed a question saying
two BNP MPs had joined the government on being appointed as state
minister and deputy minister.
	   Zillur Rahman told a meeting of a cross section of people in
Pabna on Saturday that 50 more BNP MPs are waiting to join the
consensus government of Awami League for ensuring overall good of
the people.
	   Making a counter claim, the BNP Secretary General said a group
of Awami League MPs unhappy with their leadership have been seeking
support of the opposition in parliament.
	   ``Forty of the Awami League MPs came to us. If they can bring
another ten MPs to their fold, we will extend total support to them
to form the government'', Mannan told the agency by telephone.
	   He added, ``They are tempted to come to us for, we will support
them in becoming Prime Minister and Ministers. We can make all the
50 of them ministers''.
	   Jatiya Party and JSD had representation in the consensus
government' since Awami League came to power in June, 1996. Two BNP
MPs, Dr Mohammad Alauddin of Rajshahi and Hasibur Rahman Swapan of
Sirajganj also joined the government as state minister and deputy
minister in March this year.

Tories appoint right-wing anti-abortionist as health spokesman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Conservative Party leader William Hague on Monday
appointed a right-wing legislator who opposes abortion as the
party's spokesman on health.
	   Ann Widdecombe, a staunch Roman Catholic who left the Anglican
Church because she also opposes women priests, has risen to
prominence as one of the Tories' most effective parliamentarians
since the party lost power a year ago.
	   Her appointment was part of a shakeup by Hague of the Tory
spokesmen in parliament, a group known as the Shadow Cabinet.
	   Another right-winger, Peter Lilley, who was Social Security
secretary in the previous Conservative government, was named deputy
leader of the party _ a post not filled under former prime minister
John Major, who led the party to a devastating defeat.
	   Miss Widdecombe, 50, was the only new appointee to the Shadow
Cabinet. Her colleagues in the group include Michael Howard, the
current foreign affairs spokesman, with whom she fell out when she
was his deputy in the previous government.
	   After the party's defeat, Miss Widdecombe effectively stymied
Howard's bid for the Tory leadership by saying there was
``something of the night'' about him.
	   There was no immediate sign Miss Widdecombe's strong views would
affect her position as health spokesman. Abortion is effectively
available on demand in Britain, and there is no significant public
demand for less liberal laws
	   ``This is the team that is going to hold to account the
government that is increasingly breaking its promises to the
country, and is going to generate ideas for the future,'' Hague
said as he left Tory party headquarters.
	   After a year in power, Labor Prime Minister Tony Blair holds
record popularity ratings, while opinion polls indicate
Conservative support stuck around 28 percent _ worse than the 30.6
percent than the party got in the May 1997 national election.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Wild gunfire erupted in downtown
Monday as revelers celebrated the victory in Montenegro's
parliamentary elections of the biggest challenger to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   With 94.2 percent of the vote counted, the Election Commission
in the smaller of Yugoslavia's two republics said Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic's coalition had captured 49.5 percent of
the ballots compared to 36 percent for Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic.
	   The Montenegrin separatist Liberal Alliance _ the only other
party to clear the 3 percent vote threshold to get into parliament
_ received 6.2 percent.
	   Announcing those returns, Commission Chairman Stevan Damjanovic
said votes from 40 polling stations, where about 26,000 voters were
registered, were still not counted.
	   He expected those results to be in by Monday evening but said
voting would have to be repeated in two polling stations Wednesday,
delaying an absolutely final count until later in the week.
	   Djukanovic's triumph was, 3rd graf pvs

	   HEALTH officials on Sunday gave the assurance that the
intestinal disease which killed at least 17 newborn babies and
young children in Taiwan was not likely to hit Hong Kong because of
the clean drinking water and environment here.
	   President of the Hong Kong Medical Association Dr Lo Wing-lok
said there were no signs indicating the presence here of the killer
virus _ entero-virus type 71.
	   Director for Health Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun promised her
department would follow the situation closely.
	   But no special working group would be set up at the moment, a
spokeswoman for the Health Department confirmed last night.
	   Dr Chan said symptoms of the virus were similar to most
gastro-intestinal diseases, although type 71 could develop into a
dangerous condition and be fatal in the worst case.
	   ``A patient with the disease will develop fever and diarrhoea.
	   ``If his heart is also infected, he will have shortness of
breath and heart failure.
	   ``If a patient (with a gastro-intestinal condition) has heart
failure and shortness of breath or other serious complications,
then we can tell that he is infected with the type,'' the health
spokeswoman said.
	   The spokeswoman said the virus was spread through food and close
contact or touching of an infected person's faeces and body fluids.
	   It is believed there were occasional cases here.
	   Dr Lo said children and infants were more vulnerable to the
virus than adults.
	   He said the virus would not pose a great threat to adults with a
strong immune system, but children under two years of age and who
had no immunisation could be infected more easily, he said.
	   The virus can infect the intestinal system and other organs,
including the heart.
	   But there was no evidence an outbreak would hit Hong Kong due to
its clean drinking water and environment, Dr Lo said.
	   To prevent young children from being infected, parents and
nursery staff should be cautious about hygiene, he added.
	   Meanwhile, the health spokeswoman said young children who caught
any infectious disease should be suspended from school.

Passengers stranded as Air France strike begins France's biggest strike in 27 years, smaller airlines increasing flights

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens read ``canceled'' in bright red
letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine days before the
soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 teams, sat idle at
terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts aimed at
keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of the red.
	   The walkout, Air France's biggest in 27 years, was a serious
embarrassment to the leftist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, and train workers were also threatening to strike later in
the week.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   Under normal circumstances, around 100,000 people would have
used Air France on Monday.
	   Air France assured that it would make good on its commitment to
fly World Cup teams.
	   But the airline expected to cancel 90 percent of long-haul
flights for the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are
likely to fly as planned, the company has said, as are about 20
percent leaving from Orly airport, in south Paris.
	   During the World Cup, fans will travel across France regularly
since their teams will rotate between several venues. In addition,
there are 9,000 journalists accredited to cover the event.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main union in the strike, the
SNPL, admitted the consequences were ``disastrous.''
	   ``But when you're confronted by an attack you have no choice but
to defend yourself. And that's what the pilots are doing as of
today,'' he said in an interview on television channel France 2.
	   In contrast to past conflicts when ground crews blocked airport
runways, the pilots kept a low profile and simply didn't show up
for work. Other airlines quietly went on with their flights and
some increased flight quotas in some parts of the country to cope
with demand.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday.
	   On Thursday, French industry will slow, with the CGT union
calling for a strike which is expected to affect most public
services, as well as the energy and construction sectors.

Newspaper reports deportation center to be closed in two weeks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait has temporarily released hundreds of
detainees from a controversial deportation center and is hoping to
close the facility in two weeks, Al-Watan daily reported Monday.
	   The Talha Deportation Center was set up after Kuwait was
liberated in 1991 from a seven-month Iraqi occupation. But scores
of inmates have since gone on hunger strikes or attempted suicide
to protest detentions as long as five years.
	   Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheik Mohammad al-Khaled al-Sabah said
that 250 people were freed on bail for six months to allow them to
solve problems preventing them from leaving the country, Al-Watan
reported.
	   Talha's inmates are generally debtors or or so-called stateless
Arabs that the government is seeking to deport. However, the
debtors are expected to pay what they owe before being deported,
and some of the others have nowhere to go.
	   Interior and Justice Ministry officials have met with each of
the center's inmates to ensure that their problems were solved and
that they could leave the country, Sheik Mohammad told Al-Watan.
	   Many of the stateless Arabs, which the government says number
about 120,000, maintain they have lived in Kuwait for decades, but
have been denied citizenship. The government argues most have other
passports but have destroyed them seeking Kuwait citizenship.
	   An estimated 600 people were reported detained in Talha last
month. But after the releases, only 163 people are being held at
Talba, Mohammad al-Zobi, a public prosecutor told Al-Watan. He said
that they have been there for no more than one month.
	   Al-Zobi said the debts of more than 60 inmates had been
forgiven, and hundreds of others have already left the country.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the detentions at the
center, arguing that they are protracted and sometimes done without
court order.
	   Two years ago, the government promised to shut down the
facility, which served as a school before the 1990 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait. It did not deliver on the promise.

	   Opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia yesterday said the
government would be held solely responsible for the consequences if
it tries to foil the June 9 long march planned what she said to
protest the CHT accord.
	   ``The long march will be peaceful and be attended by people from
all walks of life'' she said exchanging views with professionals
last night.
	   The professionals including university teachers, doctors,
engineers, agriculturists, journalists, lawyers and cultural
activists, expressed their solidarity with the long-march
programme, meeting sources said.
	   They told Begum Zia that they would join the programme under the
banners of their respective professional organisations.
	   The BNP chairperson told them that students, teachers, farmers,
workers and people from all other professions across the country
would join the long march in protest against the ``black'' accord
and bills on the CHT.
	   ``BNP and its front organisations are on a massive campaign for
the programme. We have already received an overwhelming response
from the people,'' she said.
	   The Leader of the Opposition said the government had endangered
country's independence and sovereignty by signing the agreement and
passing the bills ``unilaterally'' in parliament.
	   After the two-hour meeting held at 29 Minto Road, the official
residence of the Opposition Leader, press secretary to the BNP
Chairperson Ahmed Nazir briefed newsmen.
	   Among the professionals, the meeting was addressed by Prof
Emajuddin Ahmed, Prof Mostafizur Rahman, engineer Azizur Rahman,
advocate Kamruzzaman, Reazul Haq Bashir, agriculturist MA Halim,
Khandaker Sirajul Islam, Dr Salahuddin, Dr MA Aziz, Prof Jasim
Uddin, Prof Khalilur Rahman, Prof Tahmida Begum and Dr Khandaker
Mostahidur Rahman.
	   BNP leaders Dr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Khandaker Delwar
Hossain, M Shamsul Islam and Abu Hena MP were present at the
meeting.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel arap Moi, celebrating
steps toward independence 35 years ago, Monday called on Kenyans to
work together to find solutions to problems including corruption,
poverty and unemployment.
	   ``Among the many challenges we face, the most critical are
poverty and unemployment,'' Moi said. ``The war on poverty has yet
to be won.''
	   Moi addressed a crowd of thousands which gathered for Madaraka
Day, the 35th anniversary winning the right to self-government from
British colonialists. Kenya became fully independent on Dec. 12,
1963.
	   For the national holiday, the capital was decorated in the
black, red and green of the Kenyan flag. At an open-air ceremony in
Uhuru (Freedom) Park, troops marched past Moi and invited
diplomats, church choirs sang, and traditional dancers performed.
	   Later, the president pardoned 8,775 petty offenders, including
pickpockets, to mark the holiday, state-run radio reported.

Government to proceed with bank sale despite union opposition 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The government said Monday it will go
ahead with the sale of Greece's fourth largest bank, bringing it
onto a collision course with Socialist-controlled labor unions.
	   Ionian Bank employees walked off their jobs on May 8 protesting
plans by the Socialist government to sell the state-owned bank,
part of a broad-ranging plan to streamline the economy in view of
European monetary union.
	   Workers ignored a court decision Wednesday declaring the strike
illegal, forcing Premier Costas Simitis to hold an emergency
Cabinet meeting to review government privatization plans.
	   Efforts to unload Ionian have created one of the strongest trade
union backlashes against the government. Simitis still faces
problems with restructuring Olympic Airways, the debt-ridden
national carrier.
	   Protests are also expected over future plans to cut costs at the
post office, public buses and the national railroad.
	   ``We have unanimously agreed to proceed with the government's
decision to privatize Ionian Bank,'' said National Economy Minister
Yannos Papantoniou after the emergency Cabinet meeting.
	   His statement tried to allay fears of a looming split in the
governing socialist party, or PASOK, caused by the privatization
plan.
	   But the socialist-dominated Federation of Greek Bank Employee
Unions, an umbrella union, vowed to strike indefinitely unless the
government revokes the bank's sale.
	   Ionian's management has asked a court to declare the
federation's strike illegal.
	   In an attempt to defuse the situation and calm tempers,
Papantoniou invited workers and unionists for talks. He has already
pledged that no jobs will be lost in the first few years after the
sale.
	   Simitis has been struggling to keep the party united following
the death of its populist founder Andreas Papandreou two years ago.
Large portions of the party's grass roots followers believe his
free market policies contradict its socialist welfare-state
ideology.
	   ``It's a shame that a necessary policy began in a way which in
the end undermines its importance and effectiveness,'' said
European Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, a PASOK member, in an
interview with the Athens daily Ta Nea.

	   BNP Standing Committee member and former minister Dr Khandker
Mosharraf Hossain yesterday urged the people to make June 9 long
march a success for protecting the sovereignty of the country and
foiling ``conspiracy'' to surrender over one tenth of the land of
the country.
	   He was speaking as chief guest at a discussion meeting on the
17th anniversary of death of late president and founder of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Shaheed Ziaur Rahman organised
by Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Mohila Dal Dhaka city unit at the BNP
central office.
	   Presided over by BNP joint secretary general Begum Selima
Rahman, the meeting was attended by Begum Shamsunnahar Khawaja
Ahsanullah special guest.
	   Begum Rabeya Siraj, Shirin Sultana, Advocate Khaleda Panna,
Feroza Talukdar and Prof Shahriar Akhter Bulu spoke among others.
	   Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain said Zia was a successful soldier,
politician and nation-builder. He said Zia not only announced
independence but also built up a self-reliant economy changing the
image of the bottomless basket. He said Zia had introduced the
politics of production in the country.
	   He said through Bangladeshi nationalism Zia ensured the national
identity of the people of the country. He said the present ruling
party was also following the free market economy which Zia had
first introduced in the country.
	   Selima Rahman said a conspiracy against the country's
independence and sovereignty was going on. She urged the people to
unitedly foil the conspiracy.
	   Begum Shamsunnahar Khawaja Ahsanullah said Zia ensured the
freedom of press.

	   MEASURES to revive the economy, not debates over the
democratisation of Hong Kong, should top the legislative agenda,
pro-Beijing leaders say.
	   Speaking at Sunday's City Forum, Hong Kong Progressive Alliance
vice-chairman Carson Wen said legislators should act on people's
prime concerns.
	   Hong Kong people were mainly worried about stimulating the
economy to overcome the current slump and improve their livelihood,
they said.
	   Mr Wen cited a survey that found most people considered the
economy, unemployment and welfare as the most urgent matters facing
Hong Kong.
	   Those more concerned with boosting democracy were in the
minority, the survey showed.
	   Mr Wen's views were echoed by Chan Kam-lam, a legislator-elect
and core member of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong.
	   Mr Chan, who won his seat through the 800member Election
Committee, said economic development and people's livelihoods
should get a higher priority than democratisation.
	   He stressed that legislators elected through the Election
Committee and the functional constituencies could ably represent
the people.
	   Mr Chan also described as ``reckless'' current calls to amend
the Basic Law as to speed up democratic reform.
	   But Selina Chow Liang Shuk-yee of the pro-business Liberal Party
disagreed with the two, saying democratisation and economic
development were not mutually exclusive.
	   ``Democracy and the economy can't be separated,'' Mrs Chow said,
explaining that democracy did not mean giving up economic
development.
	   But she stressed that Hong Kong should maintain a healthy
environment for economic development, which was the key to its
success.
	   Owen Wong, a senior lecturer of the University of Hong Kong's
School of Professional and Continuing Education, also said the
economy and democracy were closely related.
	   He explained that people's right to vote and how they exercised
that right constituted a governing force of economic development.
	   Democratic Party vice-chairman Anthony Cheung Ping-leung said
only direct elections could guarantee that the people's calls to
revive the economy would be heeded.
	   ``If politicians failed to give you a satisfactory report card,
they have to step down, this is the promise of democracy,'' he
said.
	   Independent Andrew Wong Wang-fat cited the case of former
Indonesian president Suharto and how he had to step down.
	   Mr Wong said the pace of democratisation must be stepped up and
the Basic Law amended.
	   He criticised the government and some conservatives for trying
to scare the people by leading them to believe the economy would
worsen in a democracy.

	   The squad:
	   Goalkeepers: Chokri Ouaer (Esperance sportive tunisien,), Ali
Boumnijel (Bastia, France,) Radhouane Essalhi (Etoile sportive du
Sahel, ESS).
	   Defenders: Tarek Thabet (Esperance), Khaled Badra (Esperance),
Farid Chouchane (ESS), Mounir Boukadida (ESS), Sami Trabelsi (Club
sportif sfaxien, CSS), Jose Clayton (ESS), Hatem Trabelsi (CSS),
Sabri aballah (Club africain, CA).
	   Midfielders: Kaies Ghodbani (ESS), Siraj Eddine Chihi
(Esperance), Riadh Ouazizi (ESS), Zoubeir Baya (Freiburg), Skander
Souayah (CSS), Faycal Ben Hmid (Esperance).
	   Strikers: Imed Ben Younes (ESS), Mahdi Ben Slimane (Freiburg,

	   Workers Party of Bangladesh has called upon the democratic and
non-communal forces to build up strong resistance against the
``anti-people measures'' of the ruling Awami League which, it said,
had miserably failed to run the government.
	   The party yesterday announced a series of agitation programme on
the basis of an eleven-point charter of demands that was finalised
in the party central committee meeting on Friday.
	   According to the programme, Workers Party will stage
country-wide demonstration on June 15 and organise a fortnight
agitation programme throughout the country between July 1 and 15.
	   Announcing the programme at a press conference in the city,
party General Secretary Rashed Khan Menon called upon the
democratic non-communal forces to unite and take active part in the
movement for restoration of peoples power.
	   Criticising the failure of the government, Rashed Khan Menon
said all the election pledges made by Awami League had turned to be
hoax within two years of rule. The overall crisis had deepened due
to their inefficiency in managing the state affairs particularly
the economy of the country.

	   THE new immigration scheme of allowing Taiwanese travellers to
the mainland seven days transit in Hong Kong is impractical, a
legislator-elect charged on Sunday.
	   Howard Young of the Liberal Party, who represents the tourism
functional constituency, said the scheme had a flaw that could
diminish its effectiveness in boosting tourism.
	   ``The Immigration Department is willing to grant the transit
privilege to a holder of a valid (mainland travel) permit, but the
permit must also have a valid entry-exit endorsement.
	   ``Under the current operating system, this is not practical for
the return journey back to Taiwan from the mainland, and will not
encourage stopovers in Hong Kong on the way back,'' he said.
	   Entry-exit endorsements are currently made on a permit issued by
China Travel Service (CTS) on behalf of the mainland authority each
time the Taiwanese visitor leaves the mainland.
	   This is done by either the Taiwanese visitor going to a CTS
officer in Hong Kong, or sending the permit to CTS through an agent
in Taiwan after he has returned home.
	   ``So how can the visitor get the endorsement from CTS in Hong
Kong if he isn't allowed to enter Hong Kong to do it in the first
place?'' he asked.

	   After meeting the total domestic demand, the present stock of
urea of 4,13,000 metric tons (MT) will be raised to 5,20,000 MT
worth Taka 250 crore by the next month.
	   This was disclosed at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on
fertiliser at the conference room of the Ministry of Industries, an
official press release said Sunday.
	   Convenor of the Advisory Committee and advisor to the Prime
Minister on Agriculture and Food M Anisuzzaman presided over the
meeting.
	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed and Food and
Agriculture Minister Motia Chowdhury attended the meeting.
	   The projected demand of urea during the next financial year
(July 98-June 99) has been estimated at 21 lakh MT.
	   The six urea fertiliser factories under Bangladesh Chemical
Industries Corporation (BCIC) are expected to produce 20 lakh MT in
the next financial year making a stock of 25,20,000 MT in the
country.
	   After meeting the projected demand of 21 lakh MT, the BCIC
factories and buffer godowns will have a closing stock of 4,20,000
MT at the end of June 1999, the press release said.
	   The Bangladesh Fertiliser Association's leaders informed the
meeting that, at present they have a stock of about 1,50,000 MT.
So, all these indication shows that at the end of next financial
year country will have a total stock of 5,70,000 MT of urea.
	   The revised demand of urea for the current fiscal is 21 lakh MT.
But the country till now consumed 17,78,000 MT of urea and by the
end of June it will be 18,18,000 MT.
	   The 28 buffer godowns and godowns of six fertiliser factories
having capacity of 2,26,000 MT and 3,00,000 MT respectively are now
packed up with urea and no space left to accommodate further stock.
	   In this backdrop, the Advisory Committee has decided to export
30,000 MT of urea immediately. The committee will sit again within
a month to review the overall stock, production and supply
situation and explore possibility of further export.
	   While taking the decision the requirements of urea in the next
mini-peak (October-December) and main peak (January-March) have
also been taken care of.
	   The meeting was informed that after the next mini peak period,
5,86,000 MT of urea will be in the godowns after meeting country's
demand while the stock remain at 3,10,000 MT after meeting the
demand of the main peak period besides the stock at the dealers'
level.
	   The meeting also reviewed stock of the Triple Super Phosphate
(TSP) and Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) manure and urged the
Agriculture Extension Department to expedite the publicity to
generate more interest amongst the farmer to use DAP as a balanced
fertiliser containing sulphur and phosphorous, contents of the
soil, which could help reduce ecological imbalance of using
chemical fertiliser.
	   The meeting expressed satisfaction over the stability in price
at the retailers level.

Floods cause damage in Tajikistan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Floods caused by heavy rains damaged or destroyed
350 homes in the Central Asian country of Tajikistan, submerged
floodlands and caused an irrigation system to collapse, a news
agency reported Monday.
	   Farmland in southern Tajikistan was worst hit by the flooding
Sunday, deputy prime minister Ismat Eshmirzoyev told ITAR-Tass.
	   But in the northern Kanibadam region, 350 houses were damaged or
destroyed, an irrigation station collapsed and a water pumping
station broke, allowing hundreds of hectares (acres) of crops to be
submerged.

	   THE ailing property market must be given a timely overhaul,
legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai urged on Sunday.
	   A profit-based tax should be imposed on property developers to
replace the current lump-sum premium, she said.
	   She said this would open up the market beyond its current
dominance by large developers, and encourage competition.
	   Property-price forecasts, currently published after three
months, should be released sooner in order to give the market a
boost, she added.
	   ``Prompt and accurate information should be a stabilising
factor,'' she said.
	   And she gave her support to the lifting of pre-sale restrictions
in the property market.
	   ``Speculators are nowhere in sight but developers need to speed
up cash flow at this difficult time,'' she said.
	   Her remarks came a day after the rush for Tsing Yi flats, which
saw 1,400 units sold in one day, following the government's lifting
of restrictions on the resale of unfinished apartments.
	   The Citizens Party chairwoman said the property market must be
given all possible help and at the same time urged that Hong Kong
be less dependent on property.
	   The government should act as a guarantor for small and
medium-sized businesses otherwise unable to secure bank loans, she
said.
	   With 60 per cent of the workforce employed by small and
medium-sized businesses, and with these businesses comprising 98
per cent of Hong Kong enterprises, the government must step in to
help them during difficult economic times.
	   A pilot scheme could be set up to provide loan guarantees for
businesses having difficulties securing finance from cautious
banks.
	   Loans would be granted on the basis of industry, type and size,
and on the soundness of the business plan.
	   The legislator deplored the executive-led government of the SAR,
and the lack of public consultation on matters of policy.
	   She cited as an example the 70 per cent home-ownership target.
	   ``Just how did Mr Tung come up with 70 per cent? Why not aim for
65 or 80 per cent? ''

While students protest, Indonesia government launches graft probe 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: RELEADS with updates throughout

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing increased pressure to clean up
past misdeeds, Indonesia's new government announced a broad-based
inquiry Monday into corruption under ex-President Suharto.
	   However, it stopped short of meeting demands by student
protesters and others who want the wealth of Suharto and his
super-rich family specifically targeted.
	   Critics say the Suhartos blatantly used their power and position
to amass billions of dollars by dominating the now ailing economy.
	   Thousands of students staged peaceful protests in several cities
Monday calling for an end to both local and national graft.
	   In Jakarta, about 50 students rallied outside the U.S. Embassy
against what they said were American attempts to delay foreign
loans to Indonesia.
	   Flanked by soldiers, the protesters sat down at the gates and
chanted slogans against U.S. intervention in the affairs of their
economically-shattered country.
	   They accused the U.S. of conspiring to stall the disbursement of
aid tied to a dlrs 43 billion rescue package led by the
International Monetary Fund. The loans were suspended amid
political turmoil that led to the May 21 resignation of President
Suharto.
	   The IMF is expected to deliberate Monday on whether to resume
aid.
	   Meanwhile, a leading opposition figure has called on Suharto to
donate the bulk of his wealth back to the country as it battles its
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Amien Rais, a prominent Muslim leader, said that with Suharto's
money Indonesia would not have to beg international agencies to
prop up the economy.
	   Rais said that if Suharto did that ``the Indonesian people could
find it in their hearts to pardon him.''
	   Rais and others have called for an inquiry into Suharto's
business empire and have also demanded that the former first family
be barred from leaving the country.
	   Attorney General Sudjono Atmonegoro said the corruption inquiry
had been set up in response to public anger over the conduct of
``government officials.'' He did not specifically name Suharto.
	   ``The investigation is underway,'' he said. ``This investigation
is a process that will need time. It cannot be completed in just
one or two days.''
	   Sudjono said the inquiry would be carried out on the principle
of ``presumption of innocence'' and would involve many government
departments and outside agencies.
	   As part of the probe, Sudjono said he had received assurances
from Suharto family members that they would not leave Indonesia.
	   While there were no plans to question Suharto, the former
president might be asked to comment on evidence from others, he
said.
	   The head of the powerful military, Gen. Wiranto, said recently
he was opposed to an investigation into the Suharto family fortune
because it could cause national disunity.
	   The military played a key role in Indonesia's recent political
crisis. It quelled riots by putting thousands of soldiers and
dozens of tanks on the street.
	   Some claim it also was instrumental in persuading Suharto,
himself a retired army general, to quit in favor of new President
B.J. Habibie, a civilian and Suharto loyalist who has promised
political and economic reforms.
	   Also on Monday Habibie appointed three former Suharto advisors
to help steer the economy through its crisis.
	   The economic crisis claimed another casualty Monday when
Indonesia's third largest airline, controlled by Suharto's youngest
son, closed down.
	   The government said the carrier registered enormous losses
because of a 70 percent drop in the value of the currency, the
rupiah, since July 1997.
	   Much of the costs borne by the airline were in dollars, but its
revenue was mainly in rupiah.
	   Sempati's shareholders include Suharto's son Hutomo ``Tommy''
Mandala Putra as well as a military foundation.

	   THE fate of the Pillar of Shame will be known by September when
Hong Kong University decides if it will adopt the statue for good,
according to Student Union chairwoman Gloria Chang.
	   In a referendum conducted by the union, students said the
controversial work of art could stay.
	   ``The vice-chancellor and his associates will take the poll into
consideration when they make their final decision,'' Ms Chang said.
	   Until then, the Hong Kong City University has allowed the
sculpture to remain on the campus after the annual candlelight
vigil on Thursday.
	   The Pillar of Shame was carried to Victoria Park's football
pitch yesterday morning to be the centrepiece for the annual
commemorative event.
	   Former legislator Tsang Kin-shing, committee member of the Hong
Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movement of China,
said the statue may be buried if it did not find a permanent home
soon.
	   He said the alliance would abide by the wishes of its sculptor,
Jens Galschiot, to bury the column until democracy arrived in the
SAR.
	   If the Hong Kong government failed to give the statue a
permanent site for display, ``the next time the sculpture will see
Hong Kong will be when there is democracy'', Mr Tsang said.
	   The Provisional Urban Council last week refused a second attempt
by the pro-democracy group to have the statue placed along the
Sculpture Walk in Kowloon Park.
	   The much-travelled tower of twisted faces representing the
anguished souls of those who perished ion Tiananmen Square in 1989
has been passed around the campuses of seven universities since its
arrival in May last year.
	   Dismantling and carrying the two-tonne statue costs about
HK$10,000 each time it is moved.
	   The stress of movement has taken its toll on the column.
	   Several pieces are missing and cracks are showing in some
places.
	   A nest of chicks was discovered in one hollow in the concrete
sculpture as removal men dismantled it in the City U car park
yesterday.
	   An onlooker said: ``There might not be a statue left to
accommodate by the time anyone decides to take it.'' The artistic
value of the Pillar has been questioned by critics and politicians.
	   Oscar Ho, visual co-ordinator of the Hong Kong Arts Centre,
said: ``The Pillar of Shame is an artwork which I don't feel is
terribly strong. The images do not offer a new way of showing
political ideas.'' He admitted, however, that the sculpture did
have another function.
	   ``I regard it more as action art, a piece to contemplate, a sort
of deliberate trap.
	   ``And the Urban Council was silly and fell right into it.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens read ``canceled'' in bright red
letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine days before the
soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 teams, sat idle at
terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts aimed at
keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of the red.
	   The walkout, Air France's biggest in 27 years, was a serious
embarrassment to the leftist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, and train workers were also threatening to strike later in
the week.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   Under normal circumstances, around 100,000 people would have
used Air France on Monday.
	   Air France assured that it would make good on its commitment to
fly World Cup teams.
	   But the airline expected to cancel 90 percent of long-haul
flights for the coming week. About 25 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights out of Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport are
likely to fly as planned, the company has said, as are about 20
percent leaving from Orly airport, in south Paris.
	   During the World Cup, fans will travel across France regularly
since their teams will rotate between several venues. In addition,
there are 9,000 journalists accredited to cover the event.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main union in the strike, the
SNPL, admitted the consequences were ``disastrous.''
	   ``But when you're confronted by an attack you have no choice but
to defend yourself. And that's what the pilots are doing as of
today,'' he said in an interview on television channel France 2.
	   In contrast to past conflicts when ground crews blocked airport
runways, the pilots kept a low profile and simply didn't show up
for work. Other airlines quietly went on with their flights and
some increased flight quotas in some parts of the country to cope
with demand.
	   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, speaking on French
television, urged both sides to ``take up the path of discussion.''
	   Fearful that France's image could be tarnished when the soccer
matches begin, one leftist lawmaker, Georges Sarre, denounced the
pilots as ``the damned of the Earth.''
	   The SNPL union has called a 15-day renewable strike starting
Monday. Three smaller unions called for a strike from Monday to
Thursday.
	   On Thursday, French industry will slow, with the CGT union
calling for a strike which is expected to affect most public
services, as well as the energy and construction sectors.

	   The trading in the local foreign exchange market was moderately
active Sunday. In the interbank market demand for US dollar was
high triggered by fear of further depreciation of Taka and also the
depreciating trend of Pakistan and Indian rupee, says a Standard
Chartered Bank market commentary.
	   But due to the closure of the international markets the
nationalised banks were reluctant to sell dollars. However, US
dollar traded in small volume and is
	   reported to have traded between Taka 46.4550 and Taka 46.4650.
The call money rate eased due to maturity of treasury bills worth
Taka 343 crore and
	   is reported to have ranged between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per
cent. Bangladesh Bank accepted 30 days treasury bills worth Taka
242.90 crore at 8.43 per cent and 1 year treasury bills worth Taka
247 crore at 10.25 per cent.
	   International foreign exchange markets remain closed on weekend.
However, on Friday, in New York trading the US dollar continued to
crash upward against the Japanese yen on hack of fragile Japanese
economy. The yen came under pressure as Japan's unemployment rose
from 3.9 per cent in March to 4.1 per cent in April and weaker than
expected Japanese retail sales data. But dollar's rise was capped
due to fears of intervention by the Bank of Japan. The DEM on the
other hand ended lower against the US dollar due to Germany's heavy
exposure in Russia. New York closing on Friday for US dollar
against DEM was 1.7855/65, yen was 138.81/86, and GBP was at
1.6295/1.6305 against US dollar.

	   A FIRE believed to have been caused by an electrical
short-circuit razed a flat in Ho Man Tin Estate early Sunday
morning.
	   Two men were injured _ one while jumping from the third-floor
flat to the ground to escape the flames and the other from smoke
inhalation.
	   Both victims, aged 48 and 49, were in stable condition at Queen
Elizabeth Hospital on Sunday night.
	   The fire was reported at 2.40 am and put out by firemen about
half an hour later. Damage to the flat was extensive.
	   According to sources at the scene, the third-floor flat was
rented by a congee stall owner to serve as a dormitory for its
workers. The shop is located on the ground floor.
	   The Housing Department is investigating whether the tenant had
violated terms of its agreement with the department.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; hundreds flee 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more reported deaths; background.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in Serbia's explosive
Kosovo province prompted reports Monday of more than a dozen new
deaths and sent hundreds of people fleeing into Albania.
	   Conflicting accounts of casualties in the blocked-off areas
could not immediately be sorted out. But the bloodshed appears to
be the worst since early March when Serbian police killed more than
80 people in a crackdown on militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 1,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom had walked for as
many as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a
school. Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   Authorities in Serbia, which with Montenegro comprises all that
remains of the Yugoslav federation, claim that thousands of Kosovo
Albanians are staying in the province illegally.
	   They are trying to block Kosovo's independence bid and are using
the police and army to try to crush militants and maintain control
over the province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million is ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March. An estimated 50 percent of the Serbian province
is controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked
off, either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday blamed ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' for numerous deaths. It said that in
their efforts to cross into Albania, they shelled several villages
near Junik, ``a border town known for resisting militant
enlistings, killing several of their countrymen, including
children.''

	   MANOS
	   Meanwhile, MANOS, an anti-smoking and anti-drug organisation
arranged a discussion at the National Museum auditorium yesterday
to mark the Day.
	   Participants at the discussion said that at least 80 crore of
the total 110 crore smokers aged 15 years and above were living in
the developing countries.
	   They quoted a WHO report as saying that 47 per cent males and 12
per cent females of the world are smokers. They said 17 per cent of
the deaths globally in 1995 was caused by tobacco.
	   The discussants anticipated an increased trend in tobacco
related deaths in future which would be 22 per cent by the year
2020.
	   Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena was the chief guest on the
occasion while Prof Kabir Chowdhury was the special guest with
MANOS President Dr Arup Ratan Chowdhury in the chair. It was also

Leech found in tap in Shau Kei Wan, HONGKONG STANDARD

	   A LEECH has been found in tap water of a Shau Kei Wan public
housing unit.
	   A woman in Yiu Tung Estate said she found the leech in water
being used to make soup on Friday night.
	   ``I knew it was a leech because I saw one and was bit by one
when I worked on a farm as a girl,'' said the woman, who wouldn't
give her name.
	   As she was about to prepare a Tuen Ng Festival dinner for her
husband, daughter and son, who have been living in the flat for a
little less than three years, the woman said she filled a pot with
water from the tap.
	   ``I saw the leech in the pot when I was about to put it on the
stove top,'' she said.
	   She said the critter was black and four to five centimetres in
length.
	   She said she put it in a bowl to show to the Housing Department.
	   But the staff members reportedly told her their superior was on
holiday and would not deal with the matter until Monday.
	   A spokesman said it could not confirm whether the worm indeed
originated from the tap at this point as investigations were still
going on.
	   The woman called the Water Services Department, who also
promised to investigate.
	   The woman said no sand, rust, or any other particles had been
found in the family's tap water before.
	   In the meantime, the family is filtering the kitchen tap water
through a thin cloth.
	   ``I have to do something,'' the woman said. ``My two children
refused to drink the soup after they learned that a leech was found
in the tap water.'' A biologist said leeches suck blood when
attached to the skin, but cannot survive hot water and soap, and
are not poisonous.

Muslims worldwide ''happy'' Pakistan tested nuclear devices: Iran 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi _ the first visitor to Islamic Pakistan since it exploded
six nuclear devices _ said Monday that Muslims worldwide welcomed
the nuclear tests.
	   It is particularly so in the Middle East, where Muslims believe
their traditional adversary, Israel, possesses the ability to make
nuclear bombs, he said.
	   ``Until now, they felt in ... the Middle East that only Israel
had the capability ... now they feel confident,'' because a
fellow-Islamic country also possesses the ability to make nuclear
weapons, Kharrazi told reporters at a brief news conference upon
his arrival in the Pakistani capital Islamabad.
	   Kharrazi, however, dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing
to follow Pakistan down the nuclear road.
	   ``We don't have any nuclear weapons program ... what we have is
for peaceful purposes,'' and all Iran's nuclear facilities are open
to international inspectors, he said.
	   Last Thursday, after Pakistan tested five nuclear devices,
Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised to safeguard the
nuclear technology and vowed not to share it with any other
country.
	   Pakistan tested a sixth nuclear device on Saturday, one-upping
rival neighbor India, which detonated five nuclear devices three
weeks ago.
	   Kharrazi said India left Pakistan with no choice of whether to
test or not.
	   ``As a matter of its national security and to create a balance
in the region, Pakistan had no choice,'' he said.
	   While in Pakistan, Kharrazi said he will try to cool tempers and
ease tension in the Asian subcontinent.
	   ``We understand the security concerns of Pakistan, but at the
same time we think there should be more restraint and a relaxation
of tensions,'' he said.
	   Pakistan and India have traded a war of words since the first
nuclear test by India on May 11. India has threatened to step up
its military activity on its side of the troubled Kashmir border _
the flash point of two previous wars between the two nuclear
powers.
	   They fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was then
East Pakistan.
	   In 1990, the specter of war surfaced and many people here feared
a fourth _ possibly nuclear _ war between the uneasy neighbors.
	   Pakistan accused India of preparing to attack its nuclear sites
last week, scrambled its own air force and put its soldiers on
alert.
	   The latest accusation came from Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub who said his country had ``credible evidence'' that
India was preparing a second site to test nuclear weapons. India
denied the accusation.

	   KLANG, Sun. - Taxi operators were told to abide by their
licences or face action.
	   Selangor Road Transport Department director Ahmad Kabit said
today they had received complaints from the public that taxi
drivers were picking up passengers at unauthorised areas.
	   ``We will also not hesitate to detain the vehicles and blacklist
the operators if they do so,'' he said.
	   Ahmad was speaking to reporters after heading a seven-hour
operation starting 9pm yesterday at the Sungai Rasau toll plaza
here.
	   Ahmad said they had acted against 50 people for operating taxis
without permits.
	   Sixty RTD staff checked 1,110 vehicles during the operation.
	   He said 260 drivers were given summonses for offences such as
allowing the excessive emission of smoke, having faulty number
plates and expired road tax and licence.

	   MACAU criminal investigation chief Antonio Marques Baptista
returned at the weekend from a three-week working visit to
Portugal.
	   The Judicial Police director went to Lisbon on 9 May _ nine days
after he had personally arrested alleged triad leader Wan Kuok-koi
at the Lisboa Hotel.
	   Wan's May Day arrest came about 12 hours after Mr Baptista's car
was bombed.
	   While in Lisbon, Mr Baptista announced that he would recruit
Portuguese police experts on organised and violent crime.
	   The specialist crime-fighters, including 10 criminologists, were
expected to arrive in Macau in the next few weeks.
	   Mr Baptista _ nicknamed Rambo by admirers for his frequent
participation in high-risk anti-triad swoops _ had said Macau
police officers were in an ``unequal fight'' against organised
crime. The Judicial Police force that he heads, which is the
enclave's criminal investigation department, has a strength of
about 300.
	   Mr Baptista, who was a public prosecutor in Portugal, had also
vowed to be relentless in the fight against organised crime in
Macau. ``He is back to beat the tiger,'' a Judicial Police
detective remarked yesterday.
	   Beijing was apparently stepping up its interest too. Tian Qiyu,
a vice-minister of state security, was reported to have paid an
unheralded two-day visit to Macau in mid-May to get first-hand
information about the enclave's security woes.
	   The governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, as well as Mr Baptista
was in Lisbon at the time of Mr Tian's visit.
	   Special legislation to prepare the way for the creation of a
task force to deal with organised and violent crimes was scheduled
to be gazetted on Monday.

World wool production estimated at lowest since World War II 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Revised estimates released Monday showed world
wool production falling for the eighth successive year to a
post-World War II low.
	   But the International Wool Textile Organization said prices
remained weak because of Australia boosting supplies by selling
from a stockpile and demand depressed by financial problems in
Asia, particularly Japan.
	   A report by the agency, which represents the wool industry in
exporting and importing countries, also cited poor retail wool
sales in Europe and ``deteriorating consumer and business
confidence'' in China.
	   It said the decline in production was due largely to farmers
switching from sheep to products with better returns.
	   The Brussels-based body's new estimate put global wool
production in the 1997-98 (July-June) season at 1.429 million
metric tons (clean basis), compared with 1.438 million tons
previously forecast and 1996-97's clip of 1.474 million tons.
	   In 1989-90, output hit a record 2.01 million tons. Since then,
the agency's figures have shown declines every season _
particularly in the territories of the former Soviet Union and
Australia.
	   The 1997-98 production falls more than offset a record clip in
China.
	   The breakdown of the IWTO's latest 1997-98 global clip estimate
-- in thousands of metric tons (clean basis), with 1996- 97
comparisons in parentheses -- included Australia 442 (457), New
Zealand 201 (203), China 156 (149), former Soviet Union 83 (100),
Uruguay 55 (60), Britain 40 (42), Argentina 37 (41), Turkey 36
(36), South Africa 34 (37), India 28 (28), Iran 23 (23), Pakistan
23 (23), Irish Republic 17 (17), Spain 16 (16), Morocco 14 (14),
United States 13 (14), Brazil 11 (11), Mongolia 11 (11), Romania 11
(11) and France 10 (10).

President calls for stepping up anti-smoking movement, THE INDEPENDENT

	   President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed yesterday called for
intensifying anti-smoking movement across the country comprising
representatives from all sections of the society.
	   ``It's very difficult to free the nation from the problems
caused by smoking without an all-out effort of the government and
the private sector and strong cooperation of the people,'' he said
inaugurating a seminar at the Osmani Memorial Hall yesterday
morning.
	   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare organised the seminar in
collaboration with ADHUNIK (Amra Dhumpan Nibaran Kari), Addiction
Cure Centre and Health Education Bureau on the eve of ``World
No-Tobacco Day '98.''
	   ``Growing up without tobacco'' is the theme of this year's No
Tobacco Day.
	   Chaired by national Professor Nurul Islam, the founder President
of ADHUNIK, the function was also addressed by Health and Family
Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf and Health Secretary Muhammad
Ali.
	   ``When the trend of smoking has declined in the developed
countries following world-wide anti-smoking drive by the WHO and
UNESCO, the tendency is gradually increasing in the developing
countries,'' the President told the function.
	   In Bangladesh, he said, the number of smokers were 2 crore in
1988 which seemed to be increased by this time. ``The habit mostly
exists in the poor section of the people.''
	   President Shahabuddin said anti-smoking movement was not
vigorous in the country before 1987. In this regard, ADHUNIK has
played a pioneering role, he added.
	   The President said various steps like announcement of smoking
free zone, imposition of tax on tobacco and inclusion of
anti-smoking issues in the text books have already been taken to
discourage smoking, but expected success has not yet been achieved
in this regard.
	   ``It would be wise to prefer phase-wise pragmatic steps rather
than closing the tobacco industry at a time to avert any economic
disaster as thousands of people are involved in the industry,'' he
said.
	   The President also called for discouraging tobacco cultivation
by bringing the tobacco fields under cultivation of other cash
crops. He also suggested to discourage manufacturing and marketing
of bidi and cigarettes, and intensify campaign about the adverse
affects of smoking.
	   ``The severity of smoking will be minimised if the anti-smoking
movement can be turned into an active social movement,'' he said
calling on the doctors, teachers, engineers, journalists, writers,
poets, litterateurs and social workers to come up to supplement the
effort.
	   Health and Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Ahmed sought
cooperation of the people of all strata for a tobacco free society
as it's not possible for the government alone to get the job done.
``Youths should be refrained from tobacco to make a tobacco-free
society.''
	   He assured the anti-smoking organisations of all possible
cooperation of the government.
	   In his welcome address, Prof Nurul Islam said some 10,000 people
in the world are losing their lives everyday due to smoking.
	   Quoting WHO statistics, he said there are 60 per cent male and
7-10 per cent female smokers in Bangladesh.
	   But he assumed that the female smokers in our country is about
30 per cent.
	   Prof Islam said of the smokers 80-90 per cent are from the poor
section of the society while 23.3 per cent are school students.
	   He strongly pleaded for steps to increase tax on tobacco in the
coming national budget. ``The opposition will not protest the
increased tax,'' he hoped stressing the need for discouraging
tobacco ads in the mass media.
	   President Shahabuddin Ahmed also distributed prizes and
certificates among individuals and organisations for their
contributions to anti-smoking movement and the winners of essay
competition.
	   The awardees are: Alhaj M Nurul Amin, Sayeed Salahuddin Zaki, Dr
AKM Kafiluddin and eminent artiste Asaduzzaman Noor. Bhorer Kagoj,
Hamdard Bangladesh and ADHUNIK Chittagong Medical College branch
also received awards.
	   Ayesha Akther, Masuma Ahmed and Taslima Zaman were the winners
of essay competition.

Swiss bank's Singapore officials sue The Economist magazine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Two Singapore branch officials of the Union
Bank of Switzerland said Monday they have filed defamation suits
against The Economist magazine for accusing them of poor risk
management.
	   An article in last week's edition of the London-based magazine
said relaxed controls at the Singapore branch led to massive losses
that threaten to block the bank's merger with Swiss Bank Corp. That
merger is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval.
	   UBS branch chairman Lim Ho Kee and senior vice president James
Loh told Dow Jones Newswires that they filed writs in a local court
Monday. ``We absolutely refute all allegations made in The
Economist article,'' Lim said.
	   Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist, told Dow Jones Newswires
in a telephone interview from London, ``The Economist stands by the
article published in its issue dated May 30. If we receive a writ
for defamation, we will contest it with all due vigor.''
	   In response to the magazine article, the UBS head office in
Zurich had previously issued a statement saying that the Singapore
branch ``is and always has been integrated into the independent
centralized risk management processes for all credit and market
risks. UBS Singapore was continuously respecting these procedures,
especially the clear separation of duties.''
	   The statement said the UBS Singapore branch reported after-tax
profits of 29 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 17.17 million) last
year.

</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with officials announcing trip delayed, CHANGES
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's visit to
Egypt that was scheduled to start Tuesday has been postponed
indefinitely, officials said Monday.
	   Gadhafi's trip is ``canceled for now,'' Omar Rashwan, Libya's
coordinator for affairs with Egypt, told reporters in the western
Egyptian town of Mersa Matrouh, where Gadhafi was to stop en route
to Cairo.
	   No explanation was given. However, the Libyan leader is known
for changing plans without notice. It could also be that his visit
was considered inconvenient at a time when Egypt is heavily
involved in trying to organize an Arab summit on Mideast peace.
	   No date for a new visit has been announced. An Egyptian
presidential official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that Gadhafi will not arrive Tuesday and that the trip
was ``postponed to an indefinite date.''
	   Gadhafi was to arrive with a high-level delegation including
nine ministers and a team of businessmen to discuss boosting trade
relations and investments.
	   Gadhafi and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were scheduled to
meet Wednesday. Their talks were likely to touch on Libya's feud
with the West over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner.
	   The postponement caught Egyptian officials by surprise as many
of them were in meetings to prepare for the visit when the
announcement was made.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - City traffic police conducted their biggest
enforcement operations this year with an eight-hour blitz against
errant motorists.
	   Police issued 1,579 summonses to motorists for various offences
including driving with expired licences. Eighty motorcycles and
five cars were also seized during the operation.
	   The operation, conducted jointly by Selangor traffic police,
City Hall, the Road Transport Department and Welfare Services
Department, was led by Federal traffic chief Datuk Supian Amat.
	   Some 800 officers and men from both the city and Selangor
traffic branch, Criminal Investigation Department, Anti-Narcotics
Department and another 200 from the other government departments
took part in the operation.
	   A total of 22 youths, nine of them below 18, were detained under
section 42 of the Road Transport Act 1987 for reckless driving, 47
motorists were detained under section 45 of the same Act for
driving under the influence of alcohol while six motorists were
detained under section 45(c) of the Act.
	   Speaking to reporters later, Supian said the joint operation was
conducted mainly to curb illegal racing in the city and its
outskirts.
	   Also present was city traffic chief Superintendent Mohd Zain
Ismail.
	   Supian said police were concerned over the increasing number of
motorcyclists detained for involvement in illegal racing.
	   ``This year alone, some 388 have charged for reckless driving
and involvement in illegal racing and the number keeps
increasing,'' he said.
	   Supian said while police would continue with the enforcement,
the whole community must help to stop the menace.

	   A spokesman of the Twentieth Century Fox International, producer
of the world block-buster film 'Titanic' yesterday urged the
Bangladesh government to take action against piracy of films.
	   Michael J Werner, Director, Special Project-Asia of Twentieth
Century Fox International, was speaking at a press conference at
the Jatiya Press Club organised by Modhumita Group which released
the film in the country. Managing Director of Modhumita Group
Ziauddin Aslam and Director Iftekharuddin Naushad also spoke.
	   Michael J. Werner said since Bangladesh was a signatory to the
World Copy Right Convention it should take stern action against
piracy of films.
	   He said Titanic had set a record by doing a world-wide business
of 1.2 billion US dollars so far.
	   Iftekharuddin Naushad said pirated copies of many world famous
films were shown in cinema halls in Dhaka changing the names of the
films.
	   Ziauddin Aslam said they got 15 prints of the film ``Titanic''
and those were being shown in Dhaka and other cities and towns in
the country. He said they received the right to show ``Titanic' in
Bangladesh for US $ 10,000 from its producing firm.
	   Replying to a question why the price of tickets for ``Titanic
has been increased, Ziauddin Aslam said as the film was of more
than 3-hour length they had to cut the number of daily shows. He
said they had also installed modern world-class sound technology in
Modhumita cinema hall and renovated the hall which forced them to
increase the price of the tickets for ``Titanic''.
	   He said ``Titanic'' will be shown for an indefinite period,
perhaps for about 3 months.

	   ALL appointed seats in the municipal councils and district
boards should be abolished but the number of elected deputies
sitting on them should stay the same, a Democratic Party leader has
suggested.
	   Party vice-chairman Anthony Cheung Ping-leung put forward the
plan in a regional organisation structure streamlining proposal to
be announced on Monday.
	   Mr Cheung said although the number of directly elected seats in
the legislature had been reduced, they should not be reduced in
regional organisations.
	   He reiterated that his party supported a merger between the two
municipal councils but opposed mergers between the district boards
and the two councils.
	   Ada Wong Ying-kay, Liberal Party Provisional Urban Councillor,
had a different opinion.
	   ``Streamlining the regional organisations to make the district
bodies more efficient and better co-ordinated is more important
than the number of seats,'' she said.
	   Ms Wong suggested that if members of the future regional
organisations could be more powerful, more politicians might be
lured into joining the new organisations.
	   She urged the public and the government to not only focus on the
merger proposal, but to pay attention to the functions and
responsibilities of the regional organisations.
	   Improving co-ordination within the organisations, as well as
that with the government departments, was more important.
	   She criticised the existing system, saying it only allowed the
regional organisations to tackle some trivial matters, and members
of the district boards were toothless, that the government did not
consider them as important.
	   The municipal councils' responsibilities should not be
restricted to culture, recreation and health matters, Ms Wong said.
City councils in some foreign countries handled education and
transport issues, she said.
	   Professor Lau Siu-kai, of the Chinese University's Hong Kong
Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, believed the government had the
determination to reform the existing regional organisations, but
there would be pressure from the political parties on the issue.
	   He said under the current arrangement, the district boards had
no significant duties and the morale of their members was failing,
while the many duties of the municipal councils were overlapping
with that of government departments.

	   JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Agriculture Ministry is hopeful that the
country's food import bill can be reduced by as much as 30 per cent
by 2000.
	   Deputy Agriculture Minister Datuk Tengku Mahmud Mansor said this
was based on the encouraging response to the various food
production programmes, particularly, the integrated farming of
cattle in oil palm plantations.
	   Last year, Malaysia's food import bill totalled RM11.4 billion,
with beef, fish, vegetables and fruits topping the list.
	   After opening the Johor Baru South Area Farmers' Organisation
today, Tengku Mahmud said State Governments had responded well to
the call to allocate land for agricultural activities. He
identified these states as Johor, Pahang, Perak, Terengganu, Negri
Sembilan, Perlis, Kedah and Malacca.
	   ``I am sure the results of the campaign (to boost food
production) will be seen in 2000. I hope it will be able to
increase export,'' he said.
	   He added State Governments should allocate land for agriculture
projects on a lease basis rather than granting titles to avoid the
land from being used for other commercial projects.
	   Tengku Mahmud also said his ministry officials were continuing
discussions on ways to boost agriculture output.
	   He added the Ministry was also working out means to disburse the
RM300 million recently injected by the Government into the fund for
food, or 3F scheme. The sum was specially allocated for small
farmers including Area Farmers' Organisations.
	   He said the disbursement would prioritise cattle, poultry, fish
and vegetable farming.
	   Opening the annual general meeting earlier, Tengku Mahmud said
the economic situation had provided an opportunity to revive the
farmers' movement as the Government was giving the agriculture
sector much emphasis.
	   He said farmers and area farmers' organisations needed to
strengthen their marketing network.
	   ``Farmers must involve themselves in marketing their produce
without middlemen. This way, they will get better prices while
allowing consumers to pay less.''
	   Towards this aim, Tengku Mahmud said the Ministry had directed
the Federal Agriculture Marketing Authority to increase the number
of pasar tani or expand existing ones.
	   ``We will ask State Governments to provide areas for pasar tani.
We hope the Farmers' Organisation Authority could also arrange for
more farmers' markets.''
	   ``We have given instruction that prices at the pasar tani or
pasar peladang should be 20 per cent or even 30 per cent lower than
prices in conventional markets,'' he added.
	   In Malacca, Tengku Mahmud said the ministry was confident the
country could become a major producer of halal beef products by
2000, if farmers engage in integrated farming schemes.
	   Though it was initially targeted for 2005, the Ministry is
confident that it can be achieved within two years.
	   ``This finding is based on the promising results of the
integrated farming scheme launched by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad in Johor last month.''
	   ``If cattle breeders adopt such methods in palm oil estates, the
country could be among the major producer of halal meat,'' he said.
	   Tengku Mahmud said this after launching a seminar entitled
``Opportunities and Challenges towards Youth in the Malacca's
Agricultural Sector'' late yesterday evening.

	   ANY amendment to the Basic Law to achieve a ``one man, one
vote'' electoral system must be done by the National People's
Congress, according to Solicitor General Daniel Fung Wah-kin.
	   While last week's election result proved Hong Kong people wanted
to exercise their right to vote, Mr Fung said a more democratic
election must be achieved through the Basic Law.
	   He made the remarks while completing a seven-day visit to the
United States where he spoke to senior government officials,
business leaders, politicians, scholars, think-tanks and
commentators in four cities on the east and west coasts.
	   Mr Fung said the 53.5 per cent voter turnout in geographical
constituencies and 63.5 per cent in the functional constituencies
were higher than the United States presidential election turnout
rate of 30 per cent.
	   ``This means Hong Kong people want to participate in a
democratic election system,'' Mr Fung said.
	   But he said the speeding up of democracy must be carried out
according to the Basic Law.
	   ``Basic Law is the foundation of our mini-constitution,'' he
said. ``It has a timetable. And there is no restriction on how to
handle the question (of improving democracy) after 2007.'' Hong
Kong people have the right to push for a ``one person, one vote''
system after 2007, Mr Fung said.
	   ``Before any amendment to the Basic Law, that is before 2007, we
must abide by the Basic Law,'' he said.
	   Moreover, it would be the job of a sovereign power's body to
decide whether a change were appropriate.
	   ``Amendment to the Basic Law must, of course, be carried out by
the National People's Congress,'' Mr Fung said.
	   His hosts agreed that the transition of Hong Kong's sovereignty
had been a smooth one.
	   Such issues as human rights and right of abode had been dealt
with by the courts, he said, noting that the judiciary had remained
independent without any government influence.
	   Mr Fung said US officials praised Hong Kong for its ability to
maintain a common law jurisdiction ``according to international
standards''.
	   He said the SAR also demonstrated to the world its stability
with the lowest crime rate _ 3.5 per cent _ in the region.
	   According to Mr Fung, Hong Kong's freedom of assembly and
freedom of speech is exemplified by the approval of 1,260
demonstrations and protests since the handover.
	   ``None of these was rejected,'' he said.

	   Health and Family Welfare Minister Salahuddin Yusuf yesterday
urged the physicians to provide proper services to heart patients
in rural as well as urban areas, reports BSS.
	   ``We should extend our services to the rural areas as a lot of
people are suffering from heart diseases there,'' he said while
inaugurating a five-day national cardiology workshop at the
National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) here.
	   The minister said all physicians should be sincere and dedicated
to provide services to the patients within limited resources.
	   He said the present government has increased facilities in
different medical colleges in the country for providing proper
treatment and diagnosis of the disease. ``Some doctors and nurses
of medical college hospitals are imparted training in this
regard,'' he said.
	   The minister urged the doctors of different thana health
complexes to create awareness among the patients in the rural areas
saying the rural people are not well aware about it.
	   He underscored the need for introducing more modern facilities
in the NICVD to stop the tendency of going abroad by a section of
well-to-do people for treatment.
	   State Minister for Health and Family Welfare Dr M Amanullah,
Prof M Akhtaruzzaman, Director NICVD, and Professor of cardiology,
of NICVD M Jalaluddin also addressed the inaugural session.
	   At least 35 doctors from different health centres are
participating in the workshop.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday denied Pakistani
allegations that it had plans for another nuclear test in this
already volatile region.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said a statement from
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India was
surreptitiously preparing to conduct more tests next month was
``surprising'' _ and wrong.
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing, and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   Despite Singh's firm denial, the country's Atomic Energy
Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram was quoted by local news
agencies as telling fellow scientists at a forum in Bombay that
small tests might be carried out for research purposes _ but ``only
if necessary.'' He did not elaborate.

	   TAIPING, Sun. - The political stability of the country will
ensure a speedier recovery of the economy, Deputy International
Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Kerk Choo Ting said today.
	   He said, however, the people should reduce spending and save
more to assist the Government's economic recovery plans.
	   ``Malaysia is one of the most stable countries in the
regioneconomically, politicaly and socially.
	   ``Although the country is facing an economic downturn, chances
are that we will recover soon,'' said Kerk after opening the
Sekolah Semangat Maju Charity Food Fair here.
	   He said economic problems could be solved if there was an
international solution against non-trade currency dealings.
	   Kerk also called on the International Monetary Fund to refine
its policies if it wanted to assist Asian economies recover.
	   He added that the IMF policies were not suitable to many Asian
countries.

	   NEITHER former Legislative Council president Andrew Wong
Wang-fat nor his successor Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai will be backed by
Frontier in their bid for the presidency of the Legislative
Council.
	   Mr Wong, a lecturer from the Chinese University who won by
direct election as an independent, and Mrs Fan, an independent who
won through the Election Committee, are the front-runners in the
race for the top Legco post.
	   Emily Lau Wai-hing, convenor of the political group, said she
was displeased with Mr Wong's decision before the handover to join
the Provisional Legislative Council, which her group had considered
illegitimate. As for Mrs Fan, the Frontier leader said her switch
of position during the run-up to the handover was ``disgusting''.
	   But Ms Lau stressed Frontier legislators were not interested in
the Legco presidency, and their votes would depend on the options
available.
	   The Frontier fielded three candidates and all won seats by
direct election.
	   They are Ms Lau, social activist Cyd Ho Sau-lan and unionist Lee
Cheuk-yan.
	   Mr Wong wouldn't be drawn into an argument over Ms Lau's
comments.
	   ``I have already explained my entry to the interim legislature
at those election forums, I don't want to argue with her any
more,'' he said.
	   He said he was willing to serve as president if his fellow
legislators supported him.
	   Mrs Fan, president of the interim legislature, also said if
elected, she would be willing to serve the legislature.
	   But she was not available to comment on Ms Lau's comments last
night.

	   PETALING JAYA, Sun. - Golf, considered a game for the rich and
famous, has now been transformed to one where even the
middle-income group can enjoy, Selangor Menteri Datuk Abu Hassan
Omar said today.
	   ``This is made possible with the opening of the Seri Selangor
Golf Club at Damansara Indah, considered to be the first of its
kind in the Klang Valley and in the country,'' he said when
officiating the soft-launch of the club.
	   Abu Hassan, a golf enthusiast himself, added that since the
``golf boom''
	   in the early 90s, an increasing number of people had picked up
the game.
	   ``Golf clubs have mushroomed but many people cannot afford the
high membership fees imposed. It is as if one has to be `licensed'
to play in these expensive golf clubs,'' he said.
	   On the new 18-hole golf course, run by ASK Golf Management for
Persatuan Golf Melayu Selangor, which was given the land lease by
the Selangor State Development Corporation, he said: ``This is the
first golf club in the Klang Valley open to everybody.'' He added
that the club offered ``homeless golfers'' a place to call their
base.
	   It does not require membership fee.

	   THE Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands is looking
for volunteer sailors to help them sail to the disputed islands.
	   The committee's 100 tonne ship, Diaoyu Tai, is scheduled to set
sail on 21 June and return after 10 days from the islands that are
claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.
	   Group vice-chairman Tsang Kin-shing said they were looking for
volunteers to join up, including a boatswain, an engineer and other
veteran seafarers.
	   ``Because of the tight budget, we can only ask for volunteers,''
he said.
	   With departure day just three weeks away, the committee is still
trying to raise more funds.
	   The group, which backs China's claim to the islands, has raised
$100,000 to fund the trip but needs another $400,000.
	   As of yesterday, it had only raised $17,000 from the public. But
Mr Tsang said he was not worried.
	   ``There is still plenty of time,'' he said.
	   He said the group would continue its fund-raising activities
next week.
	   ``I hope people can come and support our mission,'' he said.

	   To mark the 50th anniversary of India's independence
celebrations, a series of cultural programmes by Indian artistes
will be performed in Chittagong in the next month, reports BSS.
	   The first such programme is a Bharata Natyam dance to be
performed by famous dancer and dance writer Leela Samson at
Chittagong Club auditorium on June 3 along with her troupe, a press
release of the Assistant High Commissioner of India said.
	   One of Leela's attributes is her multi-dimesnional role as a
performer and teacher of Bharata Natyam, and as a writer she is
able to interpret the intricacy and feel of her style in an idiom
which is intelligible and sensitive.
	   She has performed at leading dance festivals in India and
abroad. A product of Kalakshetra, the college of fine arts founded
by Rukmini Devi Arundale, her work is recorded in a documentary
film ``Sanchari''. Ms Samson has been awarded with the Sanskriti
Award and the Padmashri Award, the press release said.
	   Ms Kumkum Dhar is another famous dancer, one of the finest
exponents of the Lucknow School of Kathak who will be performing in
Chittagong on June 10 at Chittagong Club.
	   Ms Dhar has performed in Canada, USA, UK, Egypt, Israel,
Pakistan and the Middle East. A doctorate in economics, she is also
a drama artiste and a vocal musical artiste of repute. She received
her training under the legendary Kathak Maestro Guru Lachhu
Maharaj, the press release added.

Gadhafi's trip to Egypt postponed overline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with officials announcing trip delayed, CHANGES
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's visit to
Egypt that was scheduled to start Tuesday has been postponed
indefinitely, officials said Monday.
	   Gadhafi's trip is ``canceled for now,'' Omar Rashwan, Libya's
coordinator for affairs with Egypt, told reporters in the western
Egyptian town of Mersa Matrouh, where Gadhafi was to stop en route
to Cairo.
	   No explanation was given. However, the Libyan leader is known
for changing plans without notice. It could also be that his visit
was considered inconvenient at a time when Egypt is heavily
involved in trying to organize an Arab summit on Mideast peace.
	   No date for a new visit has been announced. An Egyptian
presidential official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Gadhafi will not arrive Tuesday and that the trip was
``postponed to an indefinite date.''
	   Gadhafi was to arrive with a high-level delegation including
nine ministers and a team of businessmen to discuss boosting trade
relations and investments.
	   Gadhafi and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were scheduled to
meet Wednesday. Their talks were likely to touch on Libya's feud
with the West over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner.
	   The postponement caught Egyptian officials by surprise as many
of them were in meetings to prepare for the visit when the
announcement was made.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Unknown assailants killed a religious leader
in eastern Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   It said that Mowlawi Imam Bakhsh Narouie, a Sunnni Muslim
religious leader, was killed Sunday in eastern Sistan-Baluchestan
province. It provided no other details.
	   Iran is predominantly Shiite Muslim, with small pockets of
Sunnis in Sistan-Baluchestan province and near the western border
with Iraq. The two communities live in peace.
	   Iran spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, condemned the
killing, IRNA said.

	   PENANG, Sun. - Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak
will make an announcement next week on the number of Form Six
places available to Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia holders.
	   ``I will give a full list with all details next week,'' he said
after presenting prizes to winners of the Education Ministry's
Tilawah Al-Quran at Universiti Sains Malaysia last night.
	   Najib had said earlier this month that Form Six classes would
begin at the latest by next month. Some 304,475 students had sat
the SPM examination last year.
	   In Ipoh, National Union of Teaching Profession secretary-general
S. Siva Subramaniam said today the Education Ministry must ensure
that there were enough classrooms and teachers for those allocated
places in Form Six.
	   He said the union feared that students offered places in Form
Six would have no classrooms to study.

	   Syed Kamal Bakht, MP (AL- Satkhira-1), has said that local
leaders of opposition BNP, Jatiya Party and Jamaat are out to
tarnish the image of the ruling party propagating false'
information over the possession of nine shrimp farms at Debhata and
Kaliganj thanas.
	   Addressing a press conference at a city hotel yesterday, Kamal
Bakht, who is also President of Satkhira district Awami League,
said that three persons and eight associations of the locality took
lease of nine shrimp farms from the government for about Tk 40 lakh
following the official procedure.
	   He said that those who had been illegally occupying the shrimp
firms were evicted by the government officials after the leasing.
As a result, the people who had been getting illegal benefits from
the farms began to carry on malicious propaganda against the ruling
party.
	   Kamal Bakht alleged that the BNP, Jatiya Party and Jamaat had
formed an alliance in Satkhira to resist the activities of the
ruling party. General Secretary of Satkhira district Awami League
Mansur Ahmed was present at the press conference.

	   SUPPLIES of wild American ginseng _ the precious root so popular
in Hong Kong _ may be under threat, conservationists say.
	   Over-production of the cultivated root, combined with the local
economic downturn, has led to a fall in prices in Hong Kong.
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong released a study into
the dangers facing the precious health-giving plant.
	   Author Chris Robbins claims there is a shortfall in the
management of the ginseng trade, which may lead to depletion of the
source.
	   The report states that logging and the spread of suburban
development could threaten the habitat of wild ginseng in America.
	   Over-harvest adds to the danger.
	   WWFHK spokeswoman Judy Mills said: ``A lot of people think of
rhinos, tigers and bears when they think of endangered species used
in traditional Chinese medicine _ but many rare plants are also
used.'' Traditional Chinese medicine trader Chun Kwong-shing, who
runs the Tai Wai Native Products Company, has been trading in Hong
Kong for 30 years and has this year seen a decline in demand.
	   The wholesale price per pound of wild American ginseng two years
ago was US$500 (HK$3,900), while now it is only US$300.
	   Lower prices have increased demand in spite of the hard times.
	   The conservation group has suggested setting up a conservation
trust fund through donations from the sale of American ginseng
products, and conserving wild-ginseng habitats in North America.
	   Hong Kong imports 2,500 tonnes of cultivated and 47 tonnes of
wild American ginseng annually.
	   North America is the major source of ginseng imported into Hong
Kong.
	   There is currently a ban on exports of wild ginseng from New
York state and Canada where over-picking has led to scarcity.
	   Ms Mills claims illegal shipments from these areas are further
damaging supplies.
	   But according to Cheung Chi-sun, endangered-species protection
officer for the Agricultural and Fisheries Department, there is no
significant increase in illegal imports.
	   ``It is usually just individual travellers bringing back a few
ounces of ginseng.'' Wild American ginseng grows predominantly in
the northeastern US and Canada, while the cultivated version is
found mostly in Wisconsin.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; hundreds flee 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in Serbia's explosive
Kosovo province prompted reports Monday of more than a dozen new
deaths and sent hundreds of people fleeing into Albania.
	   Conflicting accounts of casualties in the blocked-off areas
could not immediately be sorted out. But the bloodshed appears to
be the worst since early March when Serbian police killed more than
80 people in a crackdown on militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani, while 10 were killed
when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 1,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom walked for as many
as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a school.
Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   Authorities in Serbia, which with Montenegro comprises all that
remains of the Yugoslav federation, claim that thousands of Kosovo
Albanians are staying in the province illegally.
	   They are trying to block Kosovo's independence bid and are using
the police and army to try to crush militants and maintain control
over the province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million is ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March. An estimated 50 percent of the Serbian province
is controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked
off, either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday blamed ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' for numerous deaths. It said that in
their efforts to cross into Albania, they shelled several villages
near Junik, ``a border town known for resisting militant
enlistings, killing several of their countrymen, including
children.''

	   MALACCA, Sun. - The Entrepreneur Development Ministry plans to
set up a Mara education fund to help the agency disburse loans to
poor Bumiputera students who intend to pursue tertiary education.
	   Its Minister, Datuk Mustapa Mohamed, said the proposal had
already been approved by the Mara Board of Governors and the
ministry. It is awaiting approval from the Finance Ministry.
	   ``The ministry is submitting the proposal for the formation of
this fund to the Finance Ministry. Upon gaining approval the fund
will be set up next year,'' he said.
	   He was launching the MRSM Graduates Association's Education
Programme and Fund at MRSM Terendak.
	   Mustapa expressed hope Mara could raise enough funds to help
students.
	   Also present were MRSM Graduates Association president Mirzan
Mahathir, Mara deputy director-general Mydin Shariff, Third Army
Division commandant Major General Datuk Mohd Zaini Mohd Said and
Alor Gajah MP Datuk Abu Seman Mohd Yusoff.
	   Mustapa added that the ministry also hoped that contributions to
the fund could be raised from former Mara students who had either
received loans or scholarships in the past.
	   ``I think it is timely that these recipients be among the first
contributors to the fund,'' he said.
	   He added that the ministry hoped to raise between RM3 and RM4
million initially.
	   Mara had already sponsored 118,000 students to pursue higher
education either through full or partial scholarships and loans.
	   He said the additional RM101 million allocated by the Government
to Mara would enable Mara to sponsor at least 25,000 students in
local higher institutions.
	   Previously, he said the agency could only sponsor slightly more
than 11,000 students to pursue tertiary education with an initial
allocation of RM63 million.
	   Meanwhile, Mirzan said he hoped to collect as much money as
possible from the MRSM Graduates Association's Education Fund to
finance its activities.

planning another nuclear test, following its call on all nuclear
weapons states to start negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons
Convention.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan's claims that India was surreptitiously
preparing to conduct more tests next month was ``surprising'' _ and
wrong.
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing, and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   His ministry reiterated India's long-standing call for
international talks on reducing nuclear weapons in a statement
Sunday.
	   Despite Singh's firm statement that India's tests were over, the
country's Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram was
quoted by local news agencies as telling fellow scientists at a
forum in Bombay Monday that small tests might be carried out for
research purposes _ but ``only if necessary.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   India escalated the long-standing Indo-Pakistan rivalry to the
nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In response, Pakistan
claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week.
	   Pakistan's Khan said he had credible information that India was
``already in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast
somewhere in the first or second week in July.''
	   Pakistan has not said whether it would test again. U.S.
intelligence sources said they had detected no signs that either
Pakistan or India was readying new tests.
	   The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to
sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed by
both countries.
	   A top Iranian envoy arrived Monday in Pakistan and praised its
government for its nuclear tests.
	   ``From all over the world Muslims are happy that Pakistan has
this capability,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told
reporters.
	   Kharrazi dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow
Pakistan down the nuclear road.
	   ``We don't have any nuclear weapons program . . . what we have
is for peaceful purposes,'' and all Iran's nuclear facilities are
open to international inspectors, he said.
	   Violence broke out briefly Monday in Srinagar, capital of
Indian-held Kashmir, after 100 people who oppose Indian rule
distributed sweets in the streets _ a traditional way of
celebrating _ and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its
nuclear tests. Some threw stones at police, who responded by
beating protesters.
	   Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups
fighting either for Kashmir's independence or its union with
Pakistan. Pakistan says it lends them only moral support.

	   TAIPING, Sun. - Leaders of several Indian organisations have
called on universities to expel students involved in excessive
orientation acts or ragging.
	   They said it was unbecoming and barbaric of students to be
involved in such activities.
	   Perak Hindu Youth Organisation patron S. Veerasingam said Indian
students should realise that obtaining places in universities was
not so easy and as such they should not waste their time in
unneccessary activities.
	   Veerasingam, who is also Sungkai State Assemblyman, was
commenting on the latest alleged ragging incident at Universiti
Putra Malaysia.
	   In the incident, it was reported that a freshie had alleged that
five youths had ordered him to perform oral sex on them.
	   Veerasingam also called on the authorities to hold more moral
and religious classes in schools and institutes of higher learning.
	   MIC National Youth council member K. Murugesan said it was most
uncivilised for senior students to rag freshies as alleged in the
Universiti Putra Malaysian incident.
	   He said it was sad if such students were allowed to continue
their studies.
	   Murugesan also called on universities to act against those
involved in such activities.

	   The visiting Saudi Parliamentary delegation made a courtesy call
on President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina yesterday.
	   Welcoming the delegation President Shahabuddin said the existing
bonds of relationship between Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia are
characterised by utmost cordiality, mutual understanding and ever
deepening brotherly ties based on common religious faith, shared
history and culture.
	   The President said beyond the orbit of political relations, the
two countries' cooperation in economic and financial fields has
developed to a substantial proportion.
	   The Kingdom has became a major donor of aid to Bangladesh, the
President said adding that the institutional framework for economic
and technical cooperation between the two countries are provided by
the Saudi-Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission.
	   Observing that Saudi Arabia is the biggest market for the export
of Bangladesh's manpower, President Shahabuddin thanked the people
and the Saudi government for taking special care for Bangladeshis
working there.
	   He hoped that the exiting close bilateral relations between the
two brotherly Muslim countries would be expanded in future and both
the countries will continue to work together for peace, progress
and happiness of their peoples.
	   Appreciating the leading role played by the Saudi Arabia for the
cause of Muslim Ummah, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed reiterated
Bangladesh's total support to the struggle of the Palestinian
people and for their just cause.
	   Chairman of the Shoura Consultative Council Sheikh Muhammad Bin
Ibrahim Bin Jubair who led the delegation recalled with
satisfaction the development of cooperation between the two
brotherly countries and hoped that such cooperation would be
further expanded in future for the benefit of the peoples.
	   He said the Bangladeshis working in Saudi Arabia are not treated
as foreigners in the trust of sense of the term but they are
treated as brothers.
	   Saudi Ambassador to Bangladesh Abdullah Omar Barri was present
in the meeting.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Universiti Malaya's Academic Staff
Association said UM's response to its allegations that it had
deceived students and by-passed procedures in its science
matriculation programme was ``superficial''and did not address key
issues.
	   It described university's public relations officer V.T. Ratnam's
explanation to issues raised by the association as creating more
confusion instead of resolving problems.
	   The association reiterated that it was against the franchising
concept which neglected a big group of science matriculation
students, saying that it wanted all students be brought back to the
main campus.
	   The association had recently alleged that the university's
franchise programme for matriculation of science students lacked
transparency.
	   Association president Associate Professor Datuk Mahadzir Mohd
Khir had said the programme was causing confusion on two matters.
	   Firstly, neither the university's prospectus nor its
advertisements advised students of the possibility that they might
be placed in private institutions instead of the university.
	   Secondly, it was understood that the franchise scheme was to
accommodate the overspill from the university.
	   Mahadzir said only 300 places of the 2,000 places in the
university's science faculty had been filled.
	   The association, in a faxed statement, also questioned the
university's decision to choose certain private colleges, many of
which were located in shophouses and lacked sufficient science
laboratories, libraries, accommodation facilities and trained
teachers.
	   It said the association was against the university's decision to
place science matriculation students in private institutions of
higher learning under the franchise programme.
	   It further added the unversity could accommodate 2,000 science
matriculation students in its main campus.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had said on
Saturday that the local public universities franchise programme
with private institutions of higher learning was to provide more
places for students locally.
	   He said the private institutions selected for the franchise
programme were carefully scrutinised.
	   Najib said places for students to do their matriculation had to
be increased as many students had obtained good Sijil Pelajaran
Malaysia results as well as to help those who were unable to study
abroad.
	   He was speaking to reporters after launching a collection of
novels titled Koleksi Novel Lambaian Hijrah by four blind authors
at the National Library.

	   The multi-million dollar Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, renamed as
the Bangabandhu Bridge, conceived in the late sixties will be
opened for traffic from June 23 after a gala inaugural function.
	   Work on the bridge, now going on in full swing, will come to an
end by June 20, Deputy Project Manager Brig AHM Abdullah told The
Independent yesterday at the project site.
	   The bridge, which has been named after Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman, is a prestigious project of the country, for which
all the successive governments after the independence of Bangladesh
contributed a lot.
	   The bridge could have been completed by December last if the
bridge authority had not taken up the construction of the dual
gauge railway system at the northern side of the bridge along with
the construction of the main bridge, a source said.
	   The 12 metre radius curved bridge which looks like a crescent
from its southern side, connects Kalihati of Bhuapur with Saydabad
of Sirajganj linking the eastern part of the country with the west.
The curve shape of the bridge, which was designed to protect
drivers of vehicles from reflection of light, increased the length
of the bridge by 31 metres.
	   The multipurpose bridge, which is unique in the world by for its
multipurpose use, including rail movement, gas and electricity
transmission, and four-lane road, is learnt to be the 11th longest
bridge in the world with its 4.8 kilometre long pathway and 18.5
metre deck width and 1200 metre radius of carvature of bridge. The
life span of the bridge is estimated at 100 years, but engineers
said that it may be much higher if it is maintained properly.
	   Almost all the works has been completed except the setting up of
the expansion joint (the joint needed to cope with the expansion of
the bridge due to humid weather), parapet wall and barrier and
construction of some structures for laying the railway track.
	   The total estimated cost, including the escalated cost due to
delay and price hike of materials used in the bridge, is Tk 3,742
crore including Tk 163 crore for the rehabilitation of the
displaced people of the area. Of the total cost, the World Bank,
the Asian Development Bank and the OECF, Japan, provided $200
million each the total amount of which in taka terms stood at 2400
crore. The rest of the amount was provided by the Bangladesh
government. The other integrated constructions like rail, gas, 232
k.v electricity lines and telelinks required additional resources
which would be provided by the respective departments, a bridge
authority source said. The dual gauge railway system - broad gauge
and metre gauge - will require more than Tk 100 crore.
	   The eight components of the bridge such as the main bridge
(contract-1) ,river training (contract-2), East and West approach
roads (contract 3 and 4), rail approach for east and west (contract
5 and 6), the flood control embankment on east side (contract no 7)
and flood control embankment on the western side (contract no 8)
have been completed barring some finishing work. Apart from all
these major works, the government has also carried out some small
constructions for the protection of the bridge.
	   Of the total cost for the bridge, about $300 million was used
for river training to stop the shifting tendency of the river.
	   A total of 2552 local workers and about 300 expatriates were
employed during the peak period of the construction of the bridge,
i.e from October 1995 to July 1996, according to the project
authority source.
	   A five kilometre cross dam on the west side has reduced the
width of the river to almost half at 4.8 km, i.e the actual length
of the bridge. The engineers said that the 4.8 km width of the
river was sufficient to facilitate the flow of the total amount of
water through the river.
	   The first work of the bridge began in October, 1994. To begin
the work the government had to spend an amount of Tk 400 crore
which was obtained through the imposition of a surcharge on
different services. The source said the total collection of
surcharge was about Tk 560 crore. The surcharge was imposed during
the Ershad regime.
	   The bridge was conceived in 1966 and later Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman first initiated a dialogue with Japan for the
construction of the bridge after independence. The donors agreed to
provide resources during the BNP regime led by Begum Zia. The
bridge was completed during the period of the present government.
	   Three international contractors, Hyundai Construction and Samwan
Corporation of South Korea and Hamban Ward Zevi of Netherlands
executed the project. The design of the bridge was done by T.Y Lin
of USA on behalf of Rendel Palmer  Tritton and NEDECO and
Bangladesh Consultant Ltd. The RPT also did consultancy work for
Hardinge Bridge in 1912, which is still in operation. Sir Willium
Hallcrow, Prize Water House, EPC and Rahman Rahman Haque have
worked as managerial advisers to the government for the
construction of the bridge. A panel of experts led by Professor of
BUET Jamilur Reza Chowdhury also advised the government and donors.
	   There was no major problems during the construction of the
bridge. The only problems the contractors said they faced was that
they had to be very tough to maintain the work schedule. The other
problem was the numerous cracks that had developed in the hinges of
the bridge, which were mended by injecting Epoxy Resin into the
cracks so that water did not harm the iron rod of the bridge. The
other problem was the presence of solid rock at the bottom of the
river which gave the contractors a lot of trouble during the piling
work.
	   Project source said that all the work would be completed by June
20 and the bridge will be opened for a marathon race by freedom
fighters prior to its formal opening.
	   Meanwhile, a 20-member national committee headed by the
Secretary of the Jamuna Bridge Authority, Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury
has been formed to supervise the gala opening ceremony. Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the bridge. It is learnt the
opposition leader General Ershad, will also be present at the
function. There will be two meeting places during the inaugural
ceremony at the two ends of the bridge. Sheikh Hasina will travel
through the bridge by road from the Kalihati side and return from
Sayedabad by train. The train service may not be commissioned
before the construction of railway line upto Joydevpur. However the
construction of railway line upto Joydevpur has been taken up.

	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila accused
unnamed military officers of illegally smuggling gold, diamonds and
rare wood from Congo's northeastern forests.
	   Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Kabila promised that anyone
caught unlawfully buying or selling the country's resources will be
severely punished.
	   ``Nobody is above the law,'' the president said. ``The era of
institutionalized theft is over.''
	   Kabila made the statement several weeks after his minister of
economy and
	   petrol, Victor Mpoy, accused Ugandan government officials of
illegally trafficking in Congo's natural resources.
	   The accusations prompted cooler relations between Congo and
Uganda, which
	   strongly backed Kabila in his rebellion to oust the late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   More than three decades of corrupt rule by Mobutu has left the
economy in
	   this central African country in a state of decay.
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Former Civil Co-Operation Bureau
agent Ferdi Barnard was on Monday convicted of murdering
anti-apartheid activist David Webster and attempting to murder
Justice Minister Dullah Omar.
	   Barnard worked for the now-defunct Civil Cooperation Bureau, an
apartheid-era government unit that attacked anti-apartheid groups.
	   Barnard was convicted in Pretoria High Court on 25 charges,
including two murder charges, two of attempted murder and illegal
possession of weapons and ammunition.
	   He was acquitted on a further nine charges, including two
attempted murder charges, because of a lack of evidence.
	   Barnard would be returning to Pretoria maximum prison, where he
was already serving a 10-year sentence.
	   In court, Barnard for the first time admitted that he knew all
along that
	   the purpose for his monitoring Omar was to have him killed.
	   College professor Webster was shot to death outside his
Johannesburg house in 1989.
	   In February, Barnard was sentenced to 10 years for the armed
robbery of diamonds worth 10 million rand (dlrs 2 million).
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three police officers were fired for
fleeing when raiders broke into the jail they were guarding and
freed 42 prisoners, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   They were fired for cowardice, negligence and abandoning
firearms while on duty, the Daily Nation reported, quoting unnamed
sources.
	   At least 30 armed men, some of them in camouflage uniforms,
attacked Changamwe police station, near the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa, at dawn May 25. They stole three guns and killed a
watchman at a shop next door.
	   One of the stolen guns was recovered at Kaya Tsoba forest along
with 22 rounds of ammunition during an ambush on Saturday evening,
police said. No arrests were made.
	   Last August, raiders struck Likoni police station just south of
Mombasa, killing six policemen and making off with dozens of guns
and thousands of rounds of ammunition at the beginning of a wave of
attacks that claimed at least 88 lives and displaced 200,000
people.
	   Opposition, human rights and religious leaders said the attacks
were instigated by people close to President Daniel Arap Moi and
targeted people on the Indian Ocean coast who came from other parts
of the country known to support opponents of Moi.
	   The attacks ended before the general election in December, but
tension has remained high in areas where the raiders took cover,
especially in caves in the forests around Mombasa.

	   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania (AP) _ Zanzibar's first international film
festival will take place July 11-18 and will feature films made in
Africa, Iran, India, Pakistan, the Gulf States and the island
communities of the Indian Ocean.
	   Yusouf Mohammed, a British volunteer working on the festival,
says films will be shown in Zanzibar's famous Stone Town in the
refurbished Old Fort, the House of Wonders, the Palace Museum and
Victoria Garden.
	   Organizers are also planning to set up a mobile screening unit
to take the films to 26 villages on the islands of Zanzibar and
Pemba so the estimated 300,000 Zanzibaris can also see the films.
	   The embassies of France, Switzerland, Poland, Oman, India,
Spain, Egypt and South Africa have volunteered financial support
for the festival, whose cost organizers estimate at dlrs 200,000.

instantly in the weekend crash and the seventh perished in a
hospital. Two of six survivors are reported to be in critical

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Monday announced a
travel ban on members of the former Angolan rebel movement UNITA.
	   Senior UNITA officials and their adult family members would be
refused admission of transit through the country, Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said in a statement. The sanctions
were imposed in a United Nations resolution against UNITA for
failing to finish complying with a 1994 peace accord.
	   In compliance with the U.N. sanctions, South Africa would also
refuse all
	   applications by UNITA members or their families for visas,
immigration permits or the extension of temporary residence
permits.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The government says the country's
inflation rate is dropping.
	   The deputy minister of planning and finance, Luisa Diogo, put
the inflation rate from January to April at 1.4 per cent, compared
to 5.7 per cent in the same period of 1997.
	   In 1997, Mozambique achieved a one-digit inflation for the first
time since the introduction of a World Bank - International
Monetary Fund-supervized adjustment program more than 10 years ago.
	   Inflation was 54 percent in 1995, 16.3 percent in 1996 and 5.8
per cent in 1997.

	   PENANG, Sun. - Ineffective methods of imparting Islamic values
in schools have been identified as one reason why pupils are easily
influenced by negative elements.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak said one way
to rectify the situation was by reviewing Islamic education
curriculum in schools.
	   ``We can also combat negative elements by increasing Islamic
religious teachers who are able to impart knowledge of Islam in an
interesting manner to pupils,'' he said last night at Universiti
Sains Malaysia.
	   Najib was speaking after presenting prizes to winners of the
Education Ministry's Tilawah Al-Quran at the university's main
campus at Minden.
	   ``The Ministry's Islamic and Moral Education Department has been
directed to identify and formulate effective programmes,'' he said.
	   The event was also attended by USM vice-chancellor Datuk
Professor Ishak Tambi Kechik and State deputy education director
Ahmad Farouk Abdul Majid.
	   Earlier, Najib presented prizes to Mohd Salleh Saidi from Johor
and Abdul Ghani Hashim from Perak.
	   In the Qariah section (women's category), Sabariah Abdul Hamid
emerged winner with Sharifah Ainun Syed Idrus (Perlis) as runner-up
and Che Eshah Che Omar from Sabah in third place.

Russia, Finland urge Latvia to respect minority rights

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Russian-Latvian relations can be
restored to normal if the Baltic state adopts measures to improve
the status of minorities, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Monday.
	   ``Our aim is not to break the camel's back and especially not
the back of a state,'' Primakov told reporters. ``But the ball is
in Latvia's court.''
	   Angered by alleged discriminations against Latvia's 700,000
Russian speakers, Moscow in April threatened sanctions against the
Baltic state of 2.6 million.
	   Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen urged Latvia to adopt
measures proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe for the treatment of minorities.
	   ``Finland hopes Latvia, with the help of an efficient program,
will further the integration of her Russian speaking population,''
she said.
	   Halonen said that Latvia's possible future membership in the
European Union would ``constitute the best and strongest guarantee
for the future and position of the Russian speaking population.''
	   But, she added, that Finland ``as a member of a small language
area, supports the strengthening of the position of the Latvian
language.''
	   At the end of his three-day visit to Helsinki on Monday,
Primakov flew to Switzerland. Earlier, he met with President Martti
Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.

Two Singapore conglomerates plan merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hoping to capitalize on the bigger-is-better
approach, government-linked conglomerates Singapore Technologies
Industrial Corp. and Sembawang Corp. said Monday they would merge
in order to compete more profitably in Asia.
	   The new group, which will be named SembCorp Industries, will
focus on infrastructure projects, marine engineering, information
technology ventures and the leisure industry.
	   The two conglomerates said the merger will create a company with
the resources and financial strength to compete for larger projects
in the increasingly competitive markets in Asia.
	   It will have a market capitalization of 2.01 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1.19 billion), making it the 22nd largest company on
the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
	   The move must get shareholder, government and stock exchange
approval before it can proceed.
	   ``Individually, while both companies are profitable, there is a
limit to their growth potential given their current size,'' said
Wong Kok Siew, chairman of STIC and deputy chairman of Sembawang.
``In deciding to merge, both companies have significantly increased
their chances of becoming a leading Asian corporate sooner rather
than later.''
	   While the move was generally seen as positive, analysts said
investors will withhold their support until they see what concrete
steps the new group will take.
	   ``If the management delivers what they say they will deliver, it
will be good for the new company on a longer-term basis,'' said Ang
Lay Pheng, head of research at Goldman Sachs Securities. ``The
proof is in the pudding.''
	   Trading in shares in Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp. and
Sembawang Corp. was suspended on the Stock Exchange of Singapore
Monday pending the announcement.
	   STIC closed Friday at 1.66 Singapore dollars (98 cents) a share,
and Sembawang at 3.08 Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.82).
	   Under the merger plan, 1,000 shares of STIC would be exchanged
for 1,475.6 shares in the new group, and 1,000 Sembawang shares
would be exchanged for 2,543.1 SembCorp Industries shares.

	   TSEUNG Kwan O police will continue their close watch on the new
town's neighbourhoods despite a decline in the juvenile crime rate,
a senior officer said on Sunday.
	   Chief Superintendent Tam Kwok-wing revealed that the number of
youths under 21 arrested last year had declined 13.7 per cent from
278 in 1996 to 240.
	   ``However, police are concerned about the fast-growing youth
population in the district, which may lead to a rise in youth
problems,'' Chief Supt Tam said at a Fight Crime Publicity Day
speech in Tseung Kwan O.
	   He attributed the downward trend in youth crimes to two videos
outlining the serious consequences of shop-lifting and other
offences involving youngsters.
	   The videos were produced by the Sai Kung Provisional District
Boards and the Sai Kung District Fight Crime Committee (DFCC).
	   ``The anti-shop theft video was shown at schools and shopping
centres in the district early this year,'' Mr Tam added.
	   But there should be no room for complacency even though the
situation was under control, he stressed.
	   ``Looking ahead, police officers from the Kwun Tong District
will step up patrols at juvenile crime blackspots.
	   ``We aim to strengthen co-operation with the Social Welfare
Department, the Education Department, social workers and schools,
organise anti-crime seminars and video shows for parents and
teachers, and set up police outreach teams to prevent juvenile
involvement in crime.'' More Junior Police Call (JPC) members were
recruited at Sunday's Fight Crime Publicity Day, held at the East
Point City residential complex in Tseung Kwan O.

Natural rubber is in deficit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite record output in Thailand, Indonesia,
India and China, demand for natural rubber outstripped production,
the International Rubber Study Group said Monday.
	   The deficit was made up by drawing on world stocks for the first
time since 1993.
	   The synthetic rubber market was also in deficit in 1997, the
London-based intergovernmental agency said. Its latest estimates
put global natural rubber output last year at a record 6.370
million metric tons _ 40,000 higher than the previous peak in 1996.
	   Consumption _ 70 per cent of which is for tires _ rose from
6.130 million tons in 1996 to a record 6.580 million tons last
year.
	   The group's new estimates showed 1997 global synthetic rubber
production at 10.110 million tons (9.780 million tons in 1996) and
consumption at 10.150 million tons (9.590 million tons).

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda was freed
by a court Monday after spending five months under house arrest for
allegedly knowing about plans for coup last year by junior military
officers.
	   Kaunda, 74, waved to supporters on the steps of the Lusaka High
Court after state prosecutors dropped the case against him,
apparently on lack of evidence.
	   ``I feel great,'' said Kaunda, wearing a thick white beard he
has grown since his arrest on Christmas day. Supporters waved
two-finger victory salutes and cheered.
	   Jubilant supporter Christopher Malama described Kaunda's release
as a triumph for their opposition party.
	   ``Our father is out. We are very happy today,'' he said.
	   The South African government welcomed Kaunda's release, saying
in a statement that it ``creates an opportunity for all political
parties to engage in a meaningful dialogue.''

	   THE Digital Signature Act 1997 will come into immediate effect
once the Government establishes the framework in two months' time.
	   The Act, which is one of the six cyberlaws designed to
facilitate electronic commerce (e-commerce), will enable businesses
and the community to use electronic signatures instead of their
handwritten counterparts in legal and business transactions.
	   According to Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk
Leo Moggie, the framework will define the various details to
regulate the digital signature certification authorities (CAs).
	   ``These include items like the level of expertise an
organisation needs to have in the field of digital signatures
before being registered as a licensed CA,'' he said.
	   Moggie said towards that end, the Government has identified a
transitional controller of digital signatures who will primarily
license the CAs and monitor the activities of these authorities.
	   ``There are things that need to be clearly spelt out so that
people who think they have the expertise to be registered as CAs
have to satisfy all the requirements. As it is a new thing, we need
to be cautious. We will look at examples of how digital signatures
function, especially in the United States and Europe, when drawing
up the regulations,'' the Minister added.
	   On when the transitional controller will be replaced by a
permanent body, Moggie said it will depend on how the movement of
the Multimedia Convergence issue materialises.
	   ``This will be guided by the proposed Multimedia Convergence
Act. It will be part and parcel of the function of the commission
we are planning to have. Pending that, we need to have something
else in place,'' he said.
	   The Digital Signature Act defines digital signature as a
transformation of a message using an asymmetric crypto system.
	   Under such a system, only the combination between a person's
initial message and the public key belonging to the person who
signs can accurately decrypt the system.
	   The CAs appointed to monitor and supervise the use of digital
signatures must be licensed under the law. Those convicted of
operating or submitting a certification authority without valid
licences are liable to a fine of up to RM500,000 or 10 years jail,
or both.
	   In the case of a continuing offence, offenders are liable to a
daily fine not exceeding RM5,000 for each day the offence
continues.
	   Moggie also mentioned that the Government is also in the process
of drafting the Data Protection Bill which is targeted to be tabled
in Parliament by the end of this year.
	   The Act, when introduced later, is expected to give a boost to
electronic transactions as it will ensure that all data including
those of a personal nature are fully protected.
	   Moggie said the right to privacy must be protected and the
appropriate legal protection must be accorded to individuals.
``Legal provision will make it very difficult for other people to
attempt to have access to personal data on the network knowing that
there are penalties for the offence,'' he said.
	   ``However, we're still not yet ready with what would need to be
fully covered by the Act and also the deterrent level that needs to
be imposed.
	   We are still trying to draft and think through this and have it
finalised by year-end in time for the Parliament session,'' he
added.

	   Outlaws have intensified their activities in greater Rajshahi
district recently.According to reliable sources , the activists of
the outlawed Sarbahara Party, officially known as Purba Banglar
Communist Party (M-L), received a crushing blow in the hands of the
army and the then Rakkhi Bahini in Tanore and Atrai thanas of
greater Rajshahi district in 1974 in which about 100 extremists
were killed and another 100 injured.
	   The activities of the outlawed party stopped in greater Rajshahi
district since then and it turned its attention to the southern
districts of the country .The outlaws at a secret meeting in
Naogaon recently formed an organising committee comprising members
from Rajshahi, Naogaon and Natore districts . The committee has
also allegedly formed 'Killer Squads' in various thanas and unions
of the districts.
	   The members of the squads are mainly wanted criminals and
murderers.Rajshahi unit of the committee, through leaflets,
distributed in various village markets and hats recently, has
claimed the responsibility of killing Jubo League leader Lalu of
Naogaon in March last. The leaflets also claimed that the outlawed
party members also killed Abu Bakkar, chairman of Khajura Union
Parishad of Natore district in December last. Golap, a witness of
the Bakker murder case , was also allegedly killed by the activists
of the outlawed party.
	   Golap was called by some unidentified people from a tea-stall in
broad daylight and was killed by decapitating the head from the
body by sharp weapons at Birkutsa railway station during last
Ramzan. The people of these areas are passing their days in utter
panic . People of the areas do not dare come out of their homes
after dusk.It is alleged that the outlaws are sending letters to
the affluent people including political activists and farmers in
rural areas of Rajshahi, Naogaon and Natore districts demanding
huge sum of money from them.
	   They are also threatening them not to disclose the information
contained in the letters to police. The letters have triggered a
wave of panic in the areas .It is learnt the activities of these
outlawed people are spreading fast in Bagmara, Tanore and Puthia
thanas of Rajshahi district, Sadhanpur and Ballavpur areas of
Natore Sadar thana and Atrai, Rani Nagar, Porsha and Patnitola
thanas of Naogaon district.
	   The terrorists are distributing various leaflets in their
working areas secretly.The leaflets claimed that the organisational
activities of the outlaws have been geared up in Tanore with the
formation of 'guerilla units' and 'killer squads'.Informed sources
said, being weakened by factional clash in the southern region of
the country the outlaws are now trying to gear up their activities
in Rajshahi region.

	   DEMOCRATIC Party members handed a petition to Kowloon Motor Bus
(KMB) on Sunday demanding more buses for Tuen Mun passengers
missing out through diversions to the newly opened Route 3.
	   The demands included new bus routes to serve passengers
travelling from Piung Shan to Tuen Mun.
	   It was the party's first demonstration since last week's
Legislative Council elections.
	   The Democratic Party will meet KMB and Transport Department
officials on Tuesday to discuss the routing problem.
	   And Democrat legislator-elect Albert Ho Chun-yan will put the
question to Legco when the new term starts next month.
	   After the opening of Route 3 last week some commuters had to
wait up to 40 minutes for buses 68M and 68X.
	   KMB re-directed nine bus routes to the new Tai Lam Tunnel,
avoiding the congested Tuen Mun Highway.
	   The new route cuts down travel time by up to 30 minutes.
	   But passengers last week complained of long waits due to all
buses being full.
	   Following complaints, KMB promised to put more buses on the new
routes.
	   The Democratic Party claims 102 buses have been cut, including
those on the cancelled 68 and 68A routes.
	   Routes 64M, 68M, 69M, 68X and 69X have been re-routed through
the tunnel.
	   The party also says that with the loss of the 69X, residents in
the Castle Peak Road-Lingnan College area will no longer have a
direct link to Tsim Sha Tsui.
	   And residents along Tuen Mun Road are losing four routes, they
claim.

Iran says it won't build nuclear bomb 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite
nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new
security situation'' on the country, the defense minister said in
comments published Monday.
	   ``Just as the whole international and regional order has been
affected by the present situation, Iran too has been placed in a
new security situation,'' Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani said in an
interview with Tehran's Jameah daily.
	   ``Iran must take a new look at its security and strategic
situations, but this does not mean entry into the age of nuclear
(weapons) activity,'' Shamkhani was quoted as saying.
	   India tested five nuclear devices last month, which were
followed by six explosions by arch-rival Pakistan.
	   But the tests do not put Iran under pressure to start its own
nuclear weapons program, Shamkhani said. ``The present arena
concerns only India and Pakistan,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Iran denies repeated U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is
close to building an atom bomb, saying its nuclear program is
peaceful.
	   Just before he was toppled by Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution,
the U.S.-backed shah launched an ambitious nuclear program which he
said was meant to guarantee future energy needs.
	   The program was abandoned after the revolution, but restarted in
1988. So far, Iran is only known to have several small nuclear
research facilities.
	   Russia is currently building a dlrs 800 million nuclear reactor
in southern Iran despite opposition by the United States, which
says the facility could provide Tehran with the means to build a
bomb.
	   Iran has good military ties with China, which is believed to
have helped Pakistan build its bombs.

Nobel laureate foresees protests if no progress on E. Timor issue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A Nobel peace laureate said Monday the
resignation of Indonesian dictator President Suharto had brought
little change for East Timor and he predicted street protests soon
unless steps were taken to resolve the dispute over the troubled
territory.
	   ``There's been no let-up in the intimidation or repression of
the East Timorese'' said Jose Ramos-Horta, an East Timorese exile
and a leading spokesman for pro-independence forces in the
half-island territory.
	   He said government troops continued their repressive tactics
despite the fact that separatist guerillas operating out of the
territory's highlands had halted attacks. He said the guerillas
number ``a few hundred'' against more than 20,000 Indonesian
troops.
	   In a telephone interview in Portugal, Ramos-Horta said that for
the moment the East Timorese were waiting patiently for political
developments in Jakarta but added that ``if there is no substantial
improvement (in East Timor), people could soon take to the
streets.''
	   Nonetheless, he said he was hopeful of ``significant progress''
within two or three months.
	   Ramos-Horta is co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize and has
close contacts with the underground resistance movement in East
Timor which Indonesia invaded in 1975, shortly after the departure
of Portugal's colonial administration. Indonesia annexed East Timor
a year later.
	   The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the legitimate
administrative authority in East Timor and has been brokering talks
between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's future.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a major electoral triumph,
Montenegro's reformist president threw down a challenge to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Monday that could dent or ultimately
undo the strongman's rule.
	   In true Balkan style, supporters of President Milo Djukanovic
fired guns, waved flags and honked car horns as they showed their
joy at an unexpectedly decisive win over Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic in Sunday's parliamentary elections,
	   With 94.2 percent of the vote counted for the 78-seat
Montenegrin parliament, Djukanovic's coalition ''For a Better
Life'' had secured 49.5 percent of ballots cast, the State Election
Commission said.
	   Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party had 36.07 percent, the
Commission added.
	   A jubilant Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters he hoped to
build on the triumph and use it to spread democracy throughout
Yugoslavia, which now consists of just Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,'' he
said.
	   Although this mountainous republic has just 630,000 residents,
it supplies the same number of deputies to the federal Yugoslav
parliament as Serbia, with 10 million inhabitants.
	   Djukanovic and his aides are determined to stack Montenegro's
bloc with their supporters, and hope to team up with Serbian
opposition deputies to vote Milosevic out.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
strongman has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic and unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo
recently have weakened his grip.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians fighting for independence appear to
be gaining ground in ever more deadly battles with Serbian police.
	   Djukanovic first threw down the gauntlet in the winter of
1996-7, coming out against Milosevic during massive protests
against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin then narrowly beat Bulatovic _ his
former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office last January.
	   The strength of his triumph in Sunday's elections could hand him
a majority in the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament. Besides
Djukanovic's and Bulatovic's parties, only one other party _ the
Montenegrin separatist Liberal Alliance _ passed the 3 percent vote
threshold needed to get seats.
	   Djukanovic aides suggested Monday that they would insist on
Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic maneuvered
his protege into that office two weeks ago after the previous
premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western reforms.
	   The big unknown Monday was Milosevic's reaction. Typically in
such situations, he bides his time, allowing media or political
aides to speak for him before acting.
	   The state news agency Tanjug said that Bulatovic's party had
accepted Sunday's results.
	   Some 120 election monitors dispatched by the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation concluded Sunday's ballot
``was generally well conducted,'' an OSCE statement said.
	   ''I'm giving these elections a clean bill of health,'' said
Javier Ruperez of Spain, heading the monitoring team.
	   The statement urged all political parties to overcome the bitter
divisions of the election campaign and ``work now at establishing a
climate of dialogue and confidence.''
	   Media control has proven critical for all ruling parties since
the old Yugoslavia, of six republics, began its bloody break-up in
1991.
	   OSCE said Montenegrin state media were biased toward Djukanovic.
But the transatlantic organization was even more critical of
Serbian state media for its vicious attacks on the Montenegrin
president during the campaign.

Japan's governing coalition breaks up after four year alliance

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's governing coalition officially broke up
Monday ahead of parliamentary elections this summer, bringing an
end to a four-year alliance between formerly bitter rivals.
	   In a widely expected move, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
accepted the decision of the Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake to withdraw from the government.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party has already assumed all
Cabinet posts and enjoys a majority in the more powerful of Japan's
two legislative chambers, so the coalition's demise was seen as
unlikely to have much impact on the government.
	   It ended an oddball marriage between the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party and left-leaning Social Democrats, formerly
Japan's socialist party. Previous to linking up in 1996, the two
parties had been political enemies for most of the post-World War
II era.
	   ``I value our shared history of having been able to work
together,'' Hashimoto told reporters after meeting with heads of
the two former partner parties.
	   Social Democrat head Takako Doi said her party decided to end
its alliance with the LDP over disagreements with Hashimoto's party
on key issues such as proposals for more stringent legislation on
political ethics and the strengthening of U.S.-Japan defense ties.
	   Masayoshi Takemura, chairman of New Party Sakigake, said ``Over
the past year, the coalition was mainly driven at the LDP's pace
and that left it in bad shape.''
	   The withdrawal was viewed by many as a tactical move before
elections slated for sometime in July. Half of the seats in the
upper house of parliament will be up for grabs.
	   The pro-business Liberal Democratic Party has 261 seats in the
powerful 500-member lower house. With 118 seats in the less
powerful upper house, it still needs support from the 21-member
Social Democratic Party and three-member Sakigake to gain a
majority in the 252-member body.
	   The Social Democrats and Sakigake party were expected to
continue to vote with the LDP on a case-by-case basis. The Social
Democrats have pledged to support Hashimoto's administration if
opposition parties submit a no-confidence vote against the
government.
	   Hashimoto has indicated he will seek cooperation from the two
parties on some issues. Still, he may need to court additional
support from independent lawmakers and non-aligned parties such as
a lay Buddhist political group which once had close ties to the
LDP.
	   In June of 1996, the LDP joined hands with the Social Democrats
in an ``unholy alliance,'' producing Japan's first socialist prime
minister in 46 years.
	   While the two parties had long been rivals, they buried their
enmity in a bid to keep from power a reformist coalition made up of
political renegades from both parties.
	   The LDP fell from power by this reformist coalition in July of
1993 after four decades as Japan's sole ruling party.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Brilliant West Indian batsman Brian Lara was fined
2,000 pounds (dlrs 3,260) by Warwickshire county cricket officials
Monday for arriving too late to play a crucial league match on
Sunday.
	   The Warwickshire captain missed his team's four-wicket loss to
Somerset at Taunton, blaming flight delays for his late return from
a business trip to Trinidad.
	   Lara arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled start of play but
concerned officials had already replaced him in the starting 11
because of uncertainty over his whereabouts.
	   Lara was summoned to appear before a disciplinary hearing at
Edgbaston Monday, where he was ordered to pay the fine, a small
proportion of the estimated 60,000 pounds (dlrs 98,000) he will
earn playing for Warwickshire this season.
	   Disciplinary committee spokesman Dennis Amiss said he heard a
full account from Lara about his problems and accepted there were
mitigating circumstances. Amiss also said Lara apologized to the
committee and players.
	   It is the second time this season that Lara has been delayed in
the West Indies after missing his flight back to England.

public meeting at Madhabdi SP High School ground in the district on
May 22.Badruddoza Choudhury said that signing of the CHT accord had

natural resources in the hill districts.
	   On the other hand, the accord ensured all facilities for the
tribal people . He criticised the provisions of the CHT
accord.Blaming the government for severe power cricis he said that
the government could not ease the situation even after dropping the
Energy Minister. He said that the electricity crisis forced closure
of many mills, industries and factories throwing lakhs of workers
out of job.The BNP leader blamed the government for not fulfilling
its election pledges, particularly those made to the farmers .

	   I AM saddened by C.L. Goh's advice to teachers not to ask
presents from pupils and not to punish them or treat them
differently when they cannot bring a gift on Teachers' Day (NST,
May 26).
	   Teachers do not need such advice which diminishes their dignity,
least of all on an occasion society has set aside to acknowledge
their special role and contribution.
	   In spite of relatively low remuneration, lack of opportunities
for advancement, the difficult circumstances brought about by the
rapidly changing curricula, a new generation of students and
parents who do not seem to have much regard for the teaching
profession and the many frustrations within the education system
itself, teachers valiantly struggle on. Teachers' Day brings a
little consolation and encouragement.
	   Goh's account of a colleague's dilemma reveals a typical lack of
understanding of what is really going on in schools and the
problems faced by teachers and headmasters.
	   Although I do not know which school the particular child is in,
I can understand how a problem such as the bunga hidup could have
come about.
	   Teachers and headmasters are faced with the problem of pupils
trying to out-do each other in bringing presents for their teachers
on Teachers' Day.
	   To avoid the situation where the rich ones bring embarrassingly
expensive gifts and the poorer ones try to buy presents they cannot
afford, and situations where some form teachers are heaped with
presents and the non-form teachers, though not less dedicated are
neglected, some schools have standardised the gifts to a meaningful
and relatively inexpensive bunga hidup (which can even come from
the child's own garden) or perhaps to a simple card made by the
child.
	   An additional little note of appreciation from the parent would
have also gone a long way to impart some needed joy to the
teacher's heart.
	   Teachers are not asking for presents, they are asking for
understanding and trust.
	   The source of the child's distress may have nothing to do with
the fear of punishment or rejection by teachers but from the
disapproval of his peers.
	   Nonetheless, parents need to appreciate that teachers and
schools have a tremendous impact on the shaping of the mind,
character and values of their children.
	   They should seek to understand what is going on in their
children's schools and to work hand in hand with teachers in
educating the young.

Russian markets lower despite U.S. support 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Fyodorov saying no ruble devaluation
needed, but additional IMF funds would be welcome. TRIMS pvs.
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has enough cash reserves to protect
the ruble against devaluation, but additional help from the
International Monetary Fund would help calm jittery investors,
Russia's new tax chief said Monday.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday, said another dlrs 5 billion would be enough to reassure
investors shaken by last week's wave of panic selling that caused
the stock market to plummet.
	   Despite U.S. promises to support new loans by international
lenders, Russian markets sank further in early trading Monday.
	   In a brief statement issued Sunday, President Bill Clinton
expressed U.S. support for aid to Russia from such multinational
institutions as the World Bank and the IMF.
	   Nonetheless, by midday the stock market was down an additional
4.5 percent, although traders said there was little panic selling.
	   ``We are seeing a manageable fall,'' said Robert Devane, head of
fixed-income trading at Moscow's Troika-Dialog brokerage. ``We are
not yet at a critical point like last week.''
	   Altogether the stock market is down 40 percent since April. The
Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and tripled a key
interest rates to 150 percent to persuade investors to stay in
Russia.
	   The ruble was slightly weaker in trading early Monday.
	   In a move to ease the crisis, IMF officials said Friday that
they will recommend releasing a delayed payment of dlrs 700
million, the latest installment of an existing dlrs 10 billion
loan.
	   Before the crisis, Russia's economic prospects had been looking
somewhat brighter, with the government having kept a lid on
inflation and recording its first economic growth since the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   But the government has been unable to solve a years-long
payments crisis, caused by its inability to collect taxes and
therefore to pay wages to state workers. Many workers and
pensioners have been unpaid for months.
	   Fyodorov said in an earlier television interview that the
country's 35 percent tax rate must be lowered but enforcement
strengthened.
	   ``The rate should be 20 percent, but then those who do not pay
must in effect be put into prison,'' he told the NTV network.
	   Russian leaders have said that the economic crisis was triggered
by a combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices
for gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Brilliant West Indian batsman Brian Lara was fined
2,000 pounds (dlrs 3,260) by Warwickshire county cricket officials
Monday for arriving too late to play a crucial league match on
Sunday.
	   The Warwickshire captain missed his team's four-wicket loss to
Somerset at Taunton, blaming flight delays for his late return from
a business trip to Trinidad.
	   Lara arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled start of play but
concerned officials had already replaced him in the starting 11
because of uncertainty over his whereabouts.
	   Lara was summoned to appear before a disciplinary hearing at
Edgbaston Monday, where he was ordered to pay the fine, a small
proportion of the estimated 60,000 pounds (dlrs 98,000) he will
earn playing for Warwickshire this season.
	   Disciplinary committee spokesman Dennis Amiss said he heard a
full account from Lara about his problems and accepted there were
mitigating circumstances. Amiss also said Lara apologized to the
committee and players.
	   It is the second time this season that Lara has been delayed in
the West Indies after missing his flight back to England.

Yeltsin moves to strengthen government _ with help of former KGB agents 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Boris Yeltsin was fighting communism, the KGB
dogged his every step. But now that he wants to bring some order to
his unruly government, he's turning to his former enemies for help.
	   In the past week, Yeltsin has appointed three former spies to
key jobs in his administration dealing with Russia's far-flung
regions, where the Kremlin has suffered several recent setbacks.
	   Yeltsin has not commented publicly on the appointments. But
critics say the former KGB agents, trained in the repressive Soviet
system, abhor civilian control over government and are generally
anti-democratic and opposed to reforms.
	   ``They seem to be out of their mind at the Kremlin,'' says
Yevgenia Albats, a prominent Russian commentator who has followed
the KGB and its successors' activities since Soviet times.
	   First, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin, 45, a former KGB
intelligence officer posted to Germany during the 1970s, as his
first deputy chief of staff in charge of relations with Russia's
regions.
	   Then he named Gen. Viktor Zorin, former deputy chief of the
Federal Security Service _ the KGB's main successor agency _ head
of the darkly named Department for Special Programs. Little is
known about the department, although it is believed to be involved
in regional issues.
	   On Monday, Gen. Nikolai Patrushev, 46, another high-ranking
Federal Security Service official, was appointed head of the
presidential Main Control Directorate _ the department controlling
how regional officials spend money from Moscow.
	   Analyst Andrei Ryabov of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace said
the appointments were made to tighten Yeltsin's control over the
recently disobedient regions.
	   Regional officials have been blamed for misspending the federal
funds allocated to the regions _ thereby contributing to the
chronic problem of unpaid wages and pensions that touched off
recent strikes and protests.
	   Despite strong opposition from the Kremlin, voters in the rich
Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia last month elected as their governor
Alexander Lebed, a former general and national security chief with
presidential ambitions.
	   In another embarrassment, a convicted embezzler was elected
mayor in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's third largest city. Election
officials invalidated his victory after Yeltsin expressed concern
about the balloting results.
	   Ryabov, who studies Russia's domestic policy, said Yeltsin may
also be trying to recruit officials with no ties to any of the
powerful business clans vying for control over government.
	   ``Yeltsin has obviously sought to find a counterbalance to the
growing pressure of the powerful financial groups,'' he said in an
interview.
	   Ryabov cautioned against interpreting the appointments as a sign
of growing clout for the former KGB, saying today's security
officers are politically neutral bureaucrats.
	   Albats, the journalist, disagreed, saying disdain for Yeltsin's
free market reforms is widespread among the former KGB, and their
loyalties doubtful.
	   ``It's not that they are all bad guys, but they have been
brought up in the system based on violence and lawlessness,''
Albats said.
	   ``KGB people generally got a very good training, but their
skills were intended for another system and hardly suitable for the
democratic environment.''
	   The KGB was disbanded in 1991 shortly before the Soviet collapse
and divided into several successor agencies. Many former spies have
found their way into Russia's banking and business sector, while
others entered politics.

	   THE report on the approval of 3+0 programmes (NST, May 10),
quoted me as saying ``while we do not encourage such
advertisements, we will allow them if the college can furnish us
with a satisfactory reason for publishing them''.
	   This statement and the subsequent three paragraphs in the report
were taken out of context. I was clarifying on advertisements
already made concerning the 3+0 programmes by private colleges and
indicated that they are required by Department of Private Education
(JPS) to answer or explain their actions.
	   If their answers are satisfactory, they may/will be given a
warning. If not, stern action can be taken against them.
	   It is implied in the article that those advertisements are
allowed or condoned by the Ministry as long as the private colleges
have satisfactory explanation or justifications.
	   Certainly the Ministry does not allow or encourage such
advertisements merely because the colleges can provide/give prior
justifications. It contradicts the whole spirit of the article
which emphasised the need to get the Ministry's approval to run the
3+0 programmes.
	   The National Accreditation Board objects to such advertisements
and acknowledges that such matters are within the jurisdiction of
JPS.
	   It is for the Minister of Education to decide on the approval of
3+0 programmes and the issues pertaining to the applications are
within the purview of JPS.

	   Polio is essentially a disease of infancy and childhood; the
most vulnerable age is between six months to three years. There is
no specific treatment for polio. Good nursing can minimise or even
prevent crippling. Immunisation with oral drops of polio vaccine
(OPV) is the sole effective means of preventing polio. Developed
countries have used polio vaccine extensively since 1954 and have
virtually eliminated the disease, but in developing countries polio
still paralyses over 100,000 children each year.
	   The environmental sources of infection are contaminated water,
food and flies, with overcrowding and poor sanitation providing
good opportunities for exposure to infection. All these are
abundantly present in the slums of Dhaka City. Bangladesh has an
Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) through which polio
vaccine is given to children aged under 5 years. Along with routine
EPI, the government arranges the National Immunisation Day (NID)
and immunises children aged 0-5 years against polio.
	   The NIDs act as a boost factor in the strategy to eradicate
polio from Bangladesh by the year 2000. A BRAC research team
observed the latest NID on January 18, 1998 in TB Gate Jhil Par,
Agar Khan Plot, Taltola, and Karail slums of Mohakhali area in
Dhaka City. The knowledge and perception of the mothers and the
matobbars (headmen, leaders) about polio and EPI were sketchy at
best.
	   The matobbars gave more accurate answers than the mothers but it
was not markedly better. Few mothers could say why NID was held,
where, or for what reason. Most slum-dwellers did not know children
of what age or which childhood disease were the targets of the NID.
The mothers said that polio vaccine was given in oral drops three
times, but it was all right to give more drops. One mother said,
``If we get it free then we will give it to our children for as
many times as possible.''
	   She had vaccinated her eldest child but did not remember the
process or what it had included. She had heard that it might be
good for children and thus sent her child to be vaccinated with a
neighbour who knew more about these things. The only evidence of
that vaccination was the BCG vaccination mark on the child. The
Dhaka City Corporation organised the NIDs in urban Dhaka including
the slums and it was assisted by non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), and private voluntary organisations and individuals.
	   The slum community was mobilised 1-3 days before the NID. Some
mothers found out about the January 18 NID the previous day from
messages broadcast from loudspeakers, some from broadcasts on radio
and TV, but most heard about it from neighbours. Even the children
had not heard anything. The mothers and matobbars said, ``We don't
know whether miking was done because most of the time we are not
home as we go to work. No one come to give us slips or registered
our children.''Some interviewees said they had heard about the
previous NID of December 1997 mainly from the public announcements
made through loudspeakers in the vicinity of their slums.
	   If the slum-dwellers thought their children should be taken to a
vaccination centre then they usually mentioned the name of the
centre held in the previous NID in December 1997, or they asked us
where their children should be taken. Those living in Taltola
Sweeper Colony slum said that they were going to take their
children to the vaccination centre in the park the next day. The
knowledge and perception about polio were not markedly improved
after the NID session probably because other than giving oral drops
to the children little exchange of information occurred.
	   Although, after the NID all mothers interviewed correctly said
that their children were vaccinated against polio, and that
children over age 5 and fully immunised children should not receive
this vaccine. But the slum mothers also added that the oral drops
will protect their children from becoming crippled and blind and
also from fever, small diseases, hand polio, cough and measles, and
eradicate polio from Bangladesh. Most mothers walked to the centre
and it took them 5-15 minutes to reach the vaccination spot, and
they waited for 5 to 15 minutes for the children to be vaccinated.
	   They did not face any difficulties in coming to the centre. The
slum mothers opined that it was easier for them if immunisation was
given directly in the slums. The knowledge and perception of the
vaccinators varied. The vaccinators were NGO health educators,
housewives, social workers, and school boys from the slums. The NGO
health workers were more knowledgeable and they complained that
they had not received ample registers, vaccination slips, posters
or table cloths, but the social worker-housewives gave better
service in terms of the number of oral drops given than the regular
health educators.
	   The NID Sessions The BRAC research team observed two NID
vaccination centres in Karail and Taltola. Both the NID centres
started after 10 am and closed by 2 pm. Although on our way to
Taltola we saw one NID at 8:30 am already functioning. In Karail
there were two vaccination centres near the central playground, one
static arranged by an NGO called Unity Through Population Service,
and another mobile centre arranged by university students belonging
to the Rotary Club.
	   The mobile team did not use an ice-pack and had the vials in an
open bowl. In Taltola Sweeper Colony slum, the NID centre was
arranged jointly by Rotary Club and Innerwheel Club. In Karail,
vaccination centre was held in the club room of a certain political
party, and it was made of tin roof, bamboo wall and mud floor. In
Taltola the vaccination centre was a pandel set up by decorators
hired by the organisers. Inside the pandal there were table, table
cloth, several chairs, and a loudspeaker with recorder for
announcements and songs about polio vaccination.
	   The pandal was located in front of the park and next to a local
bazaar and was quite dusty. In Taltola, a 15-year-old young girl
had died one month after giving birth. Her dead body was kept near
the pandal in which the vaccination centre was held. Until her
Janaja prayer was held and her body taken away for burial no miking
was done. But after that miking was constantly done till the end of
the vaccination session. The vaccination centres displayed banners
and posters with slogans such as, 'give your child OPV
vaccination', Build a polio-free Bangladesh', the Moni' logo, and
the names of the respective organisations.
	   Vaccination was not given in an orderly manner with the parents
and children standing in lines, but it was less chaotic in Taltola.
The waiting area for the parents were not protected against the sun
or rain, but there was space for some parents to wait inside the
club room and the pandal. No supervisors came to the centre in
Karail; but the current and ex-presidents of Innerwheel Club acted
as a supervisor for the vaccination session and at the end of the
session the national and international presidents of Rotary Club
came to see how the session had done in Taltola. The vaccination
sessions immunised 1,046 children under the age of five.
	   There was no shortage of vaccines in the vaccination centres.
Vaccine was kept in a vaccine carrier with ice pack. The vaccine
vial was put on the ice pack in between the vaccine sessions in
Karail but not in Taltola. The children were given 2-6 drops of
OPV. Some children were given the oral drops at the back of the
tongue. Registers were not maintained for the target children.
According to the NGO health workers, in the 1995 NID parents were
given slips and mothers came to vaccination centres with the slips.
	   But this took more time and manpower and created disorder so the
slip system was discontinued. A 25-day-old baby was given 3 drops
of OPV in Taltola. Maternal antibodies circulate in children for
the first six months and that is why the first dose of DPT is given
at six weeks in the regular EPI schedule. Only BCG vaccination can
be given at birth. A couple of children spat out the oral drops but
they were not given the oral drops again.
	   One child looked familiar to the vaccinators and they asked how
many times he had taken the vaccine that day. He replied happily,
Twice.' In Karail 30 vials out of the 40 taken, and in Taltola 19
out of the 25 vials taken were used but in Taltola all the vials
were opened. Slum dwellers (young men and school boys) helping in
the vaccination centres were asked to help identify the children
who had been missed and they brought those children to be
immunised. But according to the slum dwellers children outside the
immediate slums were not present, ``Their mothers work so they will
probably come in the afternoon.
	   They won't come now.'' In Karail the vaccinators told the slum
women that they would give the oral drops till 2:30 pm at least.
But at 1:45 pm a local young political leader came and showed his
displeasure, ``Why are you holding a vaccination centre in our club
room without prior permission? You cannot do this. You have to
leave.'' The vaccinators protested and tried to make him understand
that the centre was for the good of the slum children and free of
cost, but this only made the leader angrier.
	   During this conversation two mothers waited with their children
and requested that their children be vaccinated too. The
vaccinators were upset and got frightened and told the mothers that
their children would not be vaccinated but in the last moment they
hurriedly vaccinated the children and quickly left Karail. The day
before the NID there was some conflict in Taltola also about
vaccinating only the children attending a school which was set up
with the help of slum leaders affiliated to a certain political
party.
	   But the social workers convinced the leaders that all slum
children should be vaccinated. In Taltola a woman came with a child
half an hour after the centre was closed because she was told that
the vaccinators would stay till 2-3 pm. Interestingly, not only
slum children but those of middle income and upper income groups
also came to be vaccinated in the centres located in the slums, but
their numbers were few. A shortcoming of the NID was that it did
not adequately publicise its mission. NIDs could not immunise all
the targeted children, and only half the children who came to the
NID sessions were given the oral drops properly.
	   Furthermore, the interference of local political leaders
hampered the delivery of this service aimed at our future
generation. Current observations indicate that NIDs will probably
be socially sustainable but the question of their being financially
sustainable remains unanswered. The government successfully
motivated NGOs, private organizations and university students to
organise and participate in the NID campaign. The organisations
targeted 1,300 and vaccinated 1,040 children, more than two-thirds
of their target. Half of the children were vaccinated properly.
	   There was some improvement in the knowledge and perception of
the parents about immunisable diseases like polio just from one
session of NID which the regular EPI in the last two decades were
not able to do. The 1,046 slum children immunised in the NID live
very near the EPI headquarters in Mohakhali, yet they had remained
non-immunised despite having access to good transportation and
finances. The NID sessions immunised socio-economically well-off
children along with slum children and this was a success since the
routine EPI had missed both the privileged and underprivileged
group of children.

	   A POLICE officer committed suicide by jumping into the path of a
Mass Transit Railway train on Sunday morning.
	   Sergeant Chan Wai-man, 49, was seen jumping onto the Kwun
Tong-bound tracks in Wong Tai Sin MTR station about 7.50 am.
	   He died shortly after arrival at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
	   A suicide note, together with the officer's warrant card and
$300 in banknotes, was found on him.
	   A police spokesman said the man was seen jumping onto the tracks
as the train approached.
	   The case was classified as suicide.
	   The victim had been with the police for 30 years, and had just
been transferred to Sha Tin from the Island District two weeks ago.
	   It was learnt that he had been telling his family and colleagues
lately that he was under tremendous stress, and wanted to commit
suicide.
	   The man, together with his wife and son, lived in a flat in Tse
Wan Shan.
	   His son, who is studying Journalism in Chu Hai College, also
worked in a television station as a freelance researcher.
	   The police said they were still investigating the motive for the
suicide.
	   The MTR said they were testing the use of glass screens on both
sides of the tracks to prevent people falling.
	   The incident interrupted the train service for about 15 minutes.

	   I AGREE with Engku Nasir's view (NST, May 22) that the proposed
fares from Kuala Lumpur to the new airport in Sepang - RM69 to RM80
by taxi, and RM31 by train - are unrealistic and frightening.
	   I remember in the late 1980s, a comfortable train ride from
Heathrow Airport to Central London was only STG1 (RM4, at the then
exchange rate) whereas taxis were charging STG15.
	   The fare must have been increased by now but it certainly would
be realistic and proportionate.
	   Based on this ratio and the 50km train ride from Central Bangkok
to Bangkok Airport for 50 sen quoted by Engku Nasir, a train fare
of RM6 to the new airport would be reasonable.

	   CASINO mogul Stanley Ho Hung-sun announced on Sunday the
enclave's international football pools would be officially launched
on 8 June, just in time for the 1998 World Cup in France.
	   Mr Ho, 76, made the announcement during Macau's international
dragon boat races.
	   According to a spokesman for Mr Ho's casino company Macau
Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM), the lottery will be run by
Slot - a subsidiary of the company.
	   Slot will accept bets on the results of selected soccer matches
drawn from national leagues, regional cups and international
matches from all over the world, providing odds and handicap-goal
for the selected matches.
	   Bets can be placed in STDM betting centres in Macau, including
the Macau Jockey Club and greyhound canidrome, and by telephone.
	   Gamblers from Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region can avail
themselves of telephone betting accounts.
	   Slot's first scheduled betting game will be the World Cup
opening match between Brazil and Scotland on 10 June, a public
holiday in Macau in celebration of Portugal's national day.
	   STDM subsidiaries hold all the enclave's government-franchised
lotteries, namely the traditional Chinese ``Pigeon'' lottery. The
STDM spokesman stressed that Macau's football pools would be the
first of its kind legally franchised in Asia.
	   Mr Ho reportedly chose 8 June as the lottery's official launch
day because the date is considered to be auspicious.

	   The Hong Kong Standard is preparing an SAR anniversary magazine
for July 1, first anniversary of the SAR. It will include an
article on Hong Kong people who emigrated in the run-up to 1997.
	   The exodus began soon after talks on Hong Kong's future were
announced. From then until the handover more than 500,000 people
emigrated to Canada, the United States, Australia and elsewhere.
Some even went to unlikely places such as South Africa and Fiji.
	   We would very much like to hear from some of these emigrants. We
would be interested in hearing about their problems of adjustment.
We would like to know how these emigrants now feel about Hong Kong.
Do they have any regrets? Are there any organisations in Hong Kong
that try to keep in touch with these emigrants or who have
knowledge on how these emigrants are faring? How many have
returned? The first ones went that went abroad would have been away
for more than 10 years by now. Have any of these returned? Are they
sending children back?

Rolls-Royce enthusiasts confuse sale of carmaker with promise of bid 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Just days before Rolls-Royce Motor Cars appeared
ready to fall under German ownership, some British auto enthusiasts
muddied the picture Monday with talk of a last-minute bid.
	   Vickers PLC, the engineering group that owns Rolls-Royce,
acknowledged the deal could be delayed by the enthusiasts, although
it has received no offer from the group calling itself Crewe
Motors, named after the English town where Rolls-Royce makes its
high-priced cars.
	   The boss of Crewe Motors, London lawyer Michael Shrimpton, had
previously talked widely about making a bid, but failed to deliver.
Now, Shrimpton insists he'll try to make a credible offer, through
the investment bank Butterfield Securities, by late Wednesday.
	   Shrimpton would not identify the wealthy Rolls-Royce and Bentley
owners he says will back him, but his goal remains the same: to
keep Rolls-Royce British.
	   Vickers acknowledged a new bid, if it seemed credible, could
force a postponement in the special shareholders meeting set for
Friday. Directors have recommended that shareholders accept a bid
of 430 million pounds (dlrs 700 million) from German carmaker
Volkswagen, and they'd hoped to announce a winner Friday afternoon.
	   Volkswagen outdid an earlier bid of 340 million pounds (dlrs 554
million) from rival BMW. BMW's bid remains on the table, but the
company insists it will not raise its price.
	   Vickers spokesman Neil Hayes said that unless a bid came in from
Shrimpton's group, ``We can't tell how serious it might be.''
	   Hayes noted, however, that Shrimpton was coming along ``rather
late, and everyone's known the situation for a long time now.''

	   In todays' medical scenario, asthma is turning out to be one of
the most serious health problems plaguing almost all countries,
both developed and under developed. According to the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the US, asthma affects
approximately 15 million Americans, four million of whom are under
18. In fact, over the last decade, there has been a 91 per cent
increase in asthma-related deaths in the US alone.
	   On global basis, at least 50 million people worldwide suffer
from asthma and allergies. Studies conducted in different cities of
India about the prevalence of asthma are quite horrifying. Case
studies in Bangalore in India among 15,556 children revealed that
instances of asthma rose from 9 per cent in 1979 to 24.5 per cent
(almost one out of every four children) in 1994. ``Among adults it
is now known that every tenth Indian sufers from asthma'', says Dr.
Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant at Apollo Hospital and President
of the Delhi Chest Forum.
	   In Jaipur, a study among 4,000 people showed that 15 per cent of
children in the age group 5 to 11 had asthma. In Delhi, the figure
is about the same. The statistics revealed in the case of India,
our closest neighbour and with enviromnental and economic condition
of people almost similar, put us pondering that situation in our
country might appear to be not very much different from India.
Statistics available from the premier hospital for chest diseases
in Dhaka revealed that asthma-related diseases and allergic
infections registered a sharp rise from its previous figure of 5
per cent in early 1990s to about 15 per cent in recent times.
	   The number of patients is on the upswing. Asthma is a chronic
disease in which airflow in and out of the lungs may be blocked by
muscle squeezing, swelling and excess mucus. Symptoms vary from
person to person, but usually include coughing, wheezing, shortness
of breath, chest tightness or producing a lot of mucus.
	   Physicians don't know the basic cause of asthma or why one
person gets asthma and another doesn't. They do know that heredity
plays some role, meaning asthma often runs in families, especially
in families who have a lot of allergies. It is known that asthma is
not caused by emotional factors such as a troubled parent-child
relationship, although emotions may affect pre-existing asthma.
Though there are no nationwide studies, doctors confirm that the
number of patients is on the upswing for reasons like an enormous
increase in air pollution, usage of common drugs like aspirin and
pain killer and an increasing list of allergens. Anyone can get
asthma but it is most likely to occur in children by age 5 and in
adults in their 30s. Even older people can develop asthma: about 10
per cent of new asthma cases are diagnosed in people who are 65
years or older.
	   Certain factors increase in people's chances of developing
asthma. For example, if one of the victim's parents has the
disease, he is more likely to get it. People having allergic
syndrome are more likely to develop asthma other than the heredity
factor. (As a matter of fact, research data have revealed that at
least 80 per cent of children and 50 per cent adults with asthma
have allergies). The factors that cause this allergic syndrome
still elude physicians. Studies have shown that the job of immune
system cells is to identify foreign substances (such as viruses and
bacteria). Normally this response protects us from dangerous
diseases. Anybody having allergies would have a super-sensitive
immune system which reacts to harmless substances like plant
pollen, dust mites, or animal dander, saliva of animals with fir or
feathers, cockroaches and their waste, stinging insects such as
bees, wasps, hornets and red ants, foods such as eggs, milk, nuts
and sea food, ingredients found in dyes, cosmetics, perfumes and
latex. These substances are called allergens.
	   And our immune system's ``overreaction'' is what causes our
allergy symptoms. What causes asthma other than these allergens is
still not known to experts even. Says an expert, ``The exact cause
still eludes us''. But what is clear is the mechanics of asthma - a
Greek word that simply means ``breathing hard''. It begins when the
body's immune system becomes so sensitized to an allergen, mainly
through heavy exposure in childhood, that it starts treating it as
a threat. When the allergen enters the body the renegade immune
system triggers the release of proteins called IgE antibodies in
response to the allergen. These antibodies surge through the blood
stream fastening themselves to cells which react by pouring out
inflammatory chemicals.
	   Confined to the nose at first, this reaction only leads to a
runny nose. But when it extends down to the lungs, the result
becomes lethal. The bronchioles (small airways) fill up with mucus
leading to laboured breathing. As more airways get choked, the
attack becomes severe. Leaving aside the family history in which
case either of the parents carrying the disease leaves the
offspring more prone to attack at certain stages of life, in most
cases the allergens trigger the attack. Topping the list of
villains mentioned earlier, air pollution these days poses the
menacing threat. Says Dr. H. Paramesh, a paediatric pulmonologist
and the Principal Investigator of the Bangalore Study, ``The risk
in asthma is directly proportional to the number of automobiles,
density of population and industrial growth.'' Ozone, diesel fumes
and suspended particles all act as irritants to the air passages.
	   Other new factors include, as already mentioned, drugs like
aspirin and Brufen (mostly pain killer). ``The indiscriminate use
of these drugs very often triggers asthma'', says Dr. Prem Sobti,
President of the Asthma, Bronchitis and Cancer Lung Foundation of
India. Doctors caution that anyone having anyone of the following
symptoms for the past 12 months should seek the advice of a doctor
to ascertain if he is heading for asthma attack:   )
If you have had a sudden severe episode or recurrent episodes of
coughing, wheezing (high-pitched whistling sounds when breathing
out) or shortness of breath.   ) If you have had cold that go to the
chest or take more than l 0
days to get over.   ) If you have had coughing, wheezing or
shortness of
breath in certain places or when exposed to certain things (e.g.
animals, tobacco smokes or perfumes).   ) If you have had used any
medications that
helped you breathe better.	   
	   Today an entire generation is learning to cope out with the
ailment. Doctors these days advise asthmatic people to carefully
select exercise activities such as walking, light jogging, leisure
biking and hiking rather than strenuous outdoor running sports.
Swimming is often recommended for asthmatics because of its many
positive factors: a warm, humid atmosphere, year-round
availability, and the body's horizontal position which may help
mobilise mucus from the bottom of the lungs. In fact, some Olympic
swimmers have severe asthma. Other activities recommended include
sports that involve short bursts of energy, such as baseball,
football, wrestling, short distance track and field events,
golfing, and gymnastics. Cold weather events such as cross-country
skiing and ice hockey or long distance non-stop activities like
basketball, field hockey or soccer are not recommended as they are
likely to aggravate airways.
	   However, childhood asthma differs from adult asthma in that
infants and small children may not show the usual signs of asthma.
Instead, asthma in children may appear as rapid respiration, noisy
breathing, retraction and chest congestion. Parents can help the
doctors better in recognising if their children are suffering from
asthma. Parents may notice that their child has less stamina during
active play time than his or her peers, or the child may try to
limit physical activities to prevent coughing or wheezing. More
subtle signs of asthma, such as chest tightness, may be overlooked
or the child does not have the capability to identify them as
asthma.
	   Recurrent or constant coughing spells may be the only common
observable symptom of asthma in young children. Though majority of
the children who get asthma grow out of it in their teens, doctors
feel that may be reversing with a lot of them retaining it through
adulthood. An asthma-trigger control plan is an important part of
controlling asthma. Most asthmatics, with inhalers or a peak flow
meter, the most recent device with a plastic contraption at close
reach, swap information and moral support. A peak flow meter is a
device that measures how well air moves out of your lungs. During
an asthma episode, the airways of the lungs begin to narrow slowly.
The peak flow meter can be used to find out if there is narrowing
of the airway hours - even days before you have any symptoms of
asthma.
	   By taking medicine early (before symptoms), one may be able to
stop the episode quickly and avoid a serious asthma attack. In an
effort to avoid serious asthma attack, families have got rid of
their pets, done away with carpets that attract dust and even
shifted residence to less polluted suburbs. Fortunately, these days
the drug and the devices arsenal to deal with asthma are quite
effective and easy to use. Only a few years ago arduous breathing
meant frequent puffs of an inhaler. Today doctors have shifted the
pattern of medication giving drugs only on emergency situation and
in most cases pattern of treatment has been more proactive relying
more on prevention. Bronchodilators are given to the asthmatics
having only a tight feeling after running a flight of stairs.
	   But an asthmatic who wheezes regularly needs a stronger drug
support.Today steroid inhalers have become first line of drugs
against asthma and in an inhaler form have little side effects.
CFC-free ``Azmacort'' introduced in the market in the last part of
1997 after a series of clinical studies done by Dr. Jacques
Caldwell, Medical Director of the Halifax Clinical Research Centre
in Daytona, Florida, and Dr. Paul Chervinsky, President of the New
England Research Centre in Darmouth, Massachusetts relieved
asthmatics quite profoundly. Bringing further relief to the
patients, researchers at the 1998 American Lung Association and the
American Thoracic Society International Conference announced on
April 28 this year, the results of the Azmacort built-in-spacer
inhaler system using PET (Positron emission tomography) imaging
technology - a device designed to enhance drug delivery and
minimise local side effects.
	   The NIH (National Institute of Health) in the US has recommended
spacer use with inhaled corticosteroids to improve inhalation
technique and reduce local side effects. So says Edward F. Haponik,
Clinical Director of the Section on Pulmonary and Critical Care
Medicine and Professor of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University
School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina in a recently
released (April 28, 1998) study conducted on patients, ``By showing
patients that a spacer helps to get more medication to the lungs,
rather than the mouth or stomach, patients may have a better
understanding of the role of the spacer''.
	   He further adds, ``Triamcinolone acetonide manufactured by Rhone
Poulenc Rorer, under the brand name Azmacort, is an
anti-inflammatory medication for the preventive management of
asthma and the only inhaled bronchial steroid clinically tested and
approved with a built-in-spacer.'' Doctors have cautioned that the
increase in asthma attacks these days is linked to the fact that
after a while, once the patient is a little better, the inhaler is
put aside without completing the prescribed course. ``There is a
feeling among patients that inhalers are bad and become a life-long
addiction'', says Dr. Deepak Sehgal, a senior consultant
pediatrician, at the Escorts Hospital in Delhi.
	   With preventive drugs most asthma patients can start an exercise
regimen. Doctors these days emphasise that with drugs most patients
can pretty well lead normal lives. But the only thing that stands
in the way is that the cost of medication is still quite
prohibitive and seems to be a burden on poor and middle class
families.

	   ARE government pensioners entitled to free medical treatment and
medication?
	   On the one hand we read that ``All government pensioners are
eligible for free medical treatment ...'' (NST, May 21) as stated
by the Honorary Secretary of the Malacca branch of the Malaysian
Government Pensioners Association. He even quoted General Orders
Chapter F and the procedure whereby one can claim reimbursement.
	   Now the Health Minister says that ``Pensioners appealing for the
continuation of free medication at Government hospitals have been
told to submit a memorandum'' (NST, May 27). If the free treatment
is already enshrined in the General Orders, then why the
memorandum? Does this mean that the benefits have been withdrawn
and we have to wait for the outcome of the memorandum?
	   This contradicts the statement made by the Director of Hospital
Kuala Lumpur, Dr Lim Kuan Joo, who assured all patients under its
care that medication prescribed by its doctors ``will be honoured
and filled accordingly'' (NST, May 26).
	   Then there is the question of getting a letter from a doctor (to
apply for reimbursement) stating the reason why he could not get
the treatment or medication. A recent case of a pensioner seemed to
show that there is still no co-ordination among the various
departments. When the pensioner asked the doctor at HKL for a
letter, the doctor said that he had no authority to give one. So
where do we stand?
	   We are honoured that the Health Minister ``regards pensioners
very highly'' and that they do not ``face undue difficulties in
terms of medical and health care'' (NST, May 27).

Eds: UPDATES with new 10th graf, Kiriyenko orders Cabinet to cut
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has enough cash reserves to protect
the ruble against devaluation, but additional help from the
International Monetary Fund would help calm jittery investors,
Russia's new tax chief said Monday.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday, said another dlrs 5 billion would be enough to reassure
investors shaken by last week's wave of panic selling that caused
the stock market to plummet.
	   Despite U.S. promises to support new loans by international
lenders, Russian markets sank further in early trading Monday.
	   In a brief statement issued Sunday, President Bill Clinton
expressed U.S. support for aid to Russia from such multinational
institutions as the World Bank and the IMF.
	   Nonetheless, by midday the stock market was down an additional
4.5 percent, although traders said there was little panic selling.
	   ``We are seeing a manageable fall,'' said Robert Devane, head of
fixed-income trading at Moscow's Troika-Dialog brokerage. ``We are
not yet at a critical point like last week.''
	   Altogether the stock market is down 40 percent since April. The
Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and tripled a key
interest rates to 150 percent to persuade investors to stay in
Russia.
	   The ruble was slightly weaker in trading early Monday.
	   In a move to ease the crisis, IMF officials said Friday that
they will recommend releasing a delayed payment of dlrs 700
million, the latest installment of an existing dlrs 10 billion
loan.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, moving to cut government
spending, Monday ordered a 30 percent reduction in Cabinet
personnel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Cabinet staffing will be
cut from 1,450 people to 1,015, the report said.
	   Before the crisis, Russia's economic prospects had been looking
somewhat brighter, with the government having kept a lid on
inflation and recording its first economic growth since the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   But the government has been unable to solve a years-long
payments crisis, caused by its inability to collect taxes and
therefore to pay wages to state workers. Many workers and
pensioners have been unpaid for months.
	   Fyodorov said in an earlier television interview that the
country's 35 percent tax rate must be lowered but enforcement
strengthened.
	   ``The rate should be 20 percent, but then those who do not pay
must in effect be put into prison,'' he told the NTV network.
	   Russian leaders have said that the economic crisis was triggered
by a combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices
for gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.

	   RENEWED interest among potential homebuyers after the lifting of
anti-speculation measures could help Hong Kong's financial and
property stocks when they resume trading on Monday, following a
lacklustre show last week, analysts said.
	   However, they added, the market still expected an uncertain week
after the government's announcement of seven emergency measures to
help revive the economy.
	   These are aimed at reversing the massive slump in consumer
spending, which the government blames for the contraction in the
first quarter.
	   The decision to relax anti-speculation rules introduced in 1994
was an attempt to stabilise the property sector and boost the
economy, analysts said.
	   ``The measures in the short term will ease the credit crunch and
will stimulate consumption,'' Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said.
	   On Friday, Hong Kong stocks rose for the first time in six days,
led by property shares, on the expectation that the government
would ease the measures it imposed several years ago designed to
curb speculation in Hong Kong's booming real estate market.
	   The Hang Seng Index (HSI) gained 56.62 points, or 0.6 per cent,
to 8,934.56, led by Sun Hung Kai Properties and Henderson Land
Development.
	   The index had fallen about 678.04 points or 7.1 per cent in the
days before the announcement.
	   However, gains were expected to be short-lived as, just after
the market closed on Friday, the government reported that first
quarter gross domestic product contracted by 2 per cent. Some
analysts expect the economy to shrink as much as 3 per cent for the
year.
	   ``The reversing of the 1994 anti-speculation package in an
attempt to stabilise prices is a potential disaster,'' said
Christopher Tinker, regional head of economics and debt research at
ING Barings.
	   ``By pursuing this line, the government is clearly backing down
on its housing policy, to the detriment of the man in the street.''
But the HSI is expected to respond favourably to the measures that
include an extension of the pre-sale period of uncompleted flats
from the current 15 months to 20 months and limiting flat sales to
companies to the last 15 per cent of each batch.

	   The UN Security Council has rebuked Pakistan for defying the
world in conducting another underground nuclear test on Saturday,
amid growing fears that an arms race with neighbouring India could
escalate out of control.Japan called an emergency session of the
15-members body on Saturday to present a resolution it had drafted
with Sweden and Costa Rica to keep pressure on the two south Asian
rivals, which between them have conducted 11 underground nuclear
explosions in the past month.
	   President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also
condemned Pakistan, adding their voices to an international chorus
of criticism and of appeals to the two nations to calm the tension
created by their nuclear tests. Pakistan, in a robust defence of
its actions, said its tests had achieved strategic stability in the
region and told its people to tighten their belts to counter
expected cuts in foreign aid. Security Council President, Njuguna
Mahugu, of Kenya told reporters often the closed-door session, that
the 15 members ``deeply deplored'' Pakistan's latest test--carried
out only hours after the council had criticised Islamabad, for its
first set of five nuclear tests conducted on Thursday.
	   India conducted five tests on May 11 and 13, its first since it
detonated one bomb in 1974. 'The council also called on the
government of Pakistan to issue a public declaration announcing a
moratorium on future tests and experimentation on delivery
systems,'' Mahugu said. India announced a moratorium on future
tests after completing its recent test programme. The council made
its comments to the media rather than issuing a formal statement
that carries the weight of international policy. But it is
considering a resolution threatening further unspecified measures
against both India and Pakistan.
	   ``The council expressed its increased concern at the risk of a
nuclear arms race escalating in south Asia and urged India and
Pakistan to accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT), that was negotiated two years ago, `` Mahugu added. Japan's
draft resolution 'encourages'' nations to stop supplying India and
Pakistan with equipment and technology that could be used to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Annan, in a separate statement, called Pakistan's action ``a
further dangerous and senseless escalation of tension which could
lead' to a nuclear arms race with incalculable consequences.'' He
appealed to the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to
demonstrate leadership and reduce tensions between them, and
repeated his offer to help mediate on the disputed region of
Kashmir. President Clinton condemned Pakistan's new nuclear test
and said, India and Pakistan were contributing to a 'self-defeating
cycle of escalation
	   '' 'These tasts can only serve to increase tensions in an
already volatile region,'' he said in a written statement, 'both
India and Pakistan need to renounce further nuclear and missile
testing immediately and take decisive steps to reverse this
dangerous arms race,'' he added. Clinton also signed documents
setting in motion economic sanctions he-imposed against Pakistan
that put in jeopardy billions of dollars in loans from multilateral
lending institution.
	   Sanctions have also been imposed against India.Japan,
Islamabad's biggest aid and trade partner, has recalled its
ambassador to Islamabad in protest, frozen new yen loans and
suspended most fresh united loans--as it did to India after the
Indian tests. Australia has suspended non-humanitarian aid. But
Russia, China and most west European states have not followed suit,
which means the same countries would likely block any punitive
action in the United Nations. Pakistani leaders remained defiant in
the face of international criticism. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said that government expenses-would be halved as part of austerity
drive to offset the likely impact of sanctions.

	   IS the once all-powerful National Party about to disappear from
the political scene. Are those dinosaurs who formerly led the cruel
racial tyranny of apartheid about to leave, finally, the green
benches of Parliament? It seems - on the face of it - possible.
	   The party which used to be a byword for organisation, for
knocking on doors and getting the vote out at election time is now
a shadow of its former self.
	   A series of local by-elections has seen the once great party
humiliated by the cheeky liberals of the Democratic Party. In the
Cape, in KwaZulu Natal, in Gauteng - especially in Gauteng, the
commercial and industrial heartland of the country, NP local
councillors have been ousted in favour of Democrats.
	   Rosettenville in the south of Johannesburg, once the rock solid
constituency of the fragrant Sheila Camerer, former junior Justice
Minister, swung impressively to the DP. Most of the seats snatched
by the DP have been in historically white areas, but in a mainly
black squatter seat on the edge of Cape Town, the NP lost to the
ANC - as well it might -but its vote dropped from 22 per cent to
two per cent.
	   In addition there has been a steady stream - and a swelling one
- of defections from the National Party to the Democratic Party.
There have been a swathe of councillors defecting in the Eastern
Cape, where the NP has got into serious bother with its Coloured
members. Former ministers have been knocking at the door of the DP
leader Tony Leon and converts to liberalism now include such as
Rina Venter, former Health Minister, and Tertius Delport, former
Minister for Constitutional Development.
	   But two weeks ago came a major blow to the new leader of the NP,
Marthinus van Schalkwyk. For the first time one of his sitting MPs
has defected. He is a Coloured former headmaster from the Eastern
Cape, and the importance of his defection is that he must
immediately lose his parliamentary seat.
	   The new Constitution contains a rigorous anti-defection clause.
If an MP is elected on one party's ticket he loses his seat if he
loses the ticket.
	   It is a powerful device for keeping petulant MPs in line. And
not many people in their middle years - as MPs mostly are - can
afford to lose the comfortable salary that goes with the job.
	   Reaction from NP stalwarts to the party's troubles has varied.
The rock- ribbed nationalists say pooh! We've had worse times.
Remember the 1980s, when the Conservative Party was defeating NP
candidates around the country? We recovered. The more nervous say
the time has come to consider merging the opposition parties.
	   One senior man - a former minister and a provincial leader -
confided that defecting at a time like this is like rearranging the
deck-chairs on the Titanic. What is needed now is a thorough
reorganisation and realignment. The urge to merge is very strong.
	   The National Party has always had a distinctly off-putting
attitude to merger. It has always meant an alliance on NP terms,
with it as the umbrella under which lesser parties could shelter.
It is already too late for that.
	   But even on kinder conditions, the Democratic Party would not
have much to gain from a merger. It would be nice to be enriched by
some of the prime city centre properties currently owned by the NP.
But the price to pay in an indiscriminate acquisition of
Nationalists and their principles might be hard for delicate
liberal sensibilities.
	   And in any case the Democratic Party does not truly need to
merge now.
	   There is no advantage in an electoral pact for except in local
councils all national and provincial assemblies are elected on a
proportional list system.
	   But Leon is happy to say that his door is always open.
	   The latest opinion poll figures are not reassuring to the NP. In
1994 the party gained 20 per cent of the votes nationwide. In an
opinion poll last November that figure was down to 12 per cent. But
last month it fell again to 10 per cent.
	   By contrast the Democratic Party got 1.73 per cent in the
general election. The November opinion poll gave them three per
cent. By last month they were on five per cent.
	   Things are not looking all that brilliant for the ruling ANC
though.
	   Much fuss has been made over statements from party leaders that
it is looking to gain a two-thirds majority in next year's
elections. This would enable it to rewrite the country's
Constitution.
	   It failed narrowly to do so in 1994 when it won nearly 63 per
cent.
	   According to November's poll that figure dropped to 58 per cent.
By last month it fell to 54 per cent. And cynics point out that if
it carries on at this rate, it would fall short of the 50 per cent
it needs to form a government on its own.

	   French President Jacques Chirac called on Israel on Saturday to
leave both occupied south Lebanon and Syria's Golan Heights, saying
it must understand it cannot have security without Middle East
peace.''Israel must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with (U.N.)
Resolution 425 and without any conditions. Syria has the right to
see the Golan Heights returned,'' he said from the steps of the
French ambassador's residence in Beirut.''In return, Israel, like
all other states in the region, has the right to full and complete
security.''The French leader then diverted from the printed text:
``But Israel must understand that her people will not know security
if there is no peace.
	   ``His call for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon triggered loud
applause from the 4,000 invited guests, including Lebanese
political, military and religious leaders.Chirac, on his third
visit to Beirut in just over two years, has been trying to boost
France's role in Middle East peace making, and proposed earlier
this month that an international conference be convened to
resurrect the U.S.-brokered peace talks.In Arab countries France is
seen as more even-handed than the United States, which is Israel's
key ally and has failed to press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu into advancing the peace process.In south Lebanon,
Israeli troops are locked in a war of attrition with pro-Iranian
Hizbollah guerrillas.
	   Israel, after heavy losses last year, has offered to leave south
Lebanon on condition the Beirut government gives security
guarantees against cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern
Israel.Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, have
rejected the proposal on the ground that the 20-year-old U.N.
resolution 425 calls for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal.Damascus, after seeing Israel reach separate peace
treaties with Egypt and Jordan, opposes negotiations with Lebanon
that ignore its demand for return of the Golan Heights.
	   Netanyahu has vowed to keep the plateau, which Israel captured
in 1967 and which dominates nearby areas of both Israel and
Syria.Chirac said Paris was prepared to help guarantee border
security: ``France is prepared to participate with others, if the
parties concerned make a request, to guarantee your borders.''''I
believe that once the Israelis have retreated as part of a global
peace, the Lebanese army, along with the internal security forces,
should be the sole upholders of the authority of the state in all
your territory,'' he added.Chirac earlier discussed Middle East
developments with Lebanon's top leaders, President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri.The French leader's 43-hour visit to Beirut, which ends on
Sunday, has been rich in symbolism of the French legacy and hopes
for the future.
	   He stayed at the elegant Ottoman-era residence of the French
envoy in the heart of Beirut that was heavily damaged in the
1975-1990 civil war and formally re-opened when Chirac
arrived.Chirac recalled the dark days of the civil war, in which a
French ambassador and a defence attache were assassinated, but
spoke of a bright future in a Lebanon undergoing multi-billion
dollar reconstruction.He made clear his sympathy for Lebanese
civilians who have fallen to Israeli attacks, sending Air Force
Colonel Daniel Bastien, deputy to the head of his personal military
staff, to the southern town of Qana.He placed a wreath with a
ribbon marked ``The President of the French Republic'' in a
graveyard that has become a national shrine since 100 Lebanese
civilian refugees were killed by Israeli shells in a 1996 military
offensive.

	   THE unusually high number of unsuccessful university
applications in spite of the applicants' good results has raised
several questions regarding Unit Pusat Universiti's selection and
administrative process. There is, undoubtedly, a strong case for an
overhaul of the process. It should be thinking hard on the reasons
which led to the dismal failure of the process when it appeared to
be working effectively in the past. As such, its proposed
post-mortem on the process is a welcome move.
	   Arguably, the department must also deal with the contentious
issue of whether there had been any extraneous element that can be
attributed to the shambles. The scenario where a successful
applicant is instructed to register at a private college, a
franchise holder of a university's franchise programme, is
disturbing. Imagine the shock of both parents and applicants to
receive an envelope and letter, bearing the name of a public
university, instructing them to enrol at a private college where
the fees are far higher compared with the university.
	   Granted, miscommunication could be a reason for the confusion
that arose. We are not hurling wild accusations. Such cases also
point to the possibility of a university picking up more than the
number of students it can accommodate for its matriculation
programme with the ultimate aim of re-routing the excess to various
franchise-holder colleges. If it had not recruited beyond the
number it could accommodate, the students would be picked up by the
institutions of their second, third and fourth choices.
	   But the practice of accepting beyond the number of available
places is, in effect, depriving the students of the chance to be
enlisted by the other universities. Neither can they gain admission
into Institut Teknologi Mara since under the UPU rules, ITM is
prohibited from accepting students who have been admitted into
other universities and their franchise programmes.
	   That there is an element of commercial interest - the five
universities with franchise programmes will obtain a certain
percentage for every enrolment in the programmes - lends a
disturbing dimension to the scenario. If an attempt to force the
students into the programmes had transpired, we can only describe
the action as unconscionable. The public has the right to question
the morality of such an action. A situation where universities act
as recruitment agents for their franchise holders should be
avoided. Lest the relationship between the universities and
franchise holders be deemed as incestuous.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had told students
allocated places in these franchise programmes not to worry about
the high fees since Mara would provide sponsorship for most of
them. But the good minister misses the point if he treats the issue
as merely a question of funding. The franchise programme is an
excellent idea since it allows people to pursue their education at
a higher level. But universities should not behave or be seen to
behave in a manner which suggests they may be tinkering with the
admission process to profit from the franchise programmes.
	   Accepting students but only to have them re-routed to franchise
holders is unwarranted. Neither should the franchise holders have
access to the list of applications meant for UPU and the
universities for the admission process into the public tertiary
institutions. UPU must ensure its process is not open to such
abuse.

	   CHINA Development Corp says it will buy a leasehold property in
Honolulu, Hawaii, at a cost of US$68 million (HK$526 million) from
US firms SHC-Realty and MKS Executive Partners.
	   It's the first major foray by the investment group into US real
estate.
	   Of the total amount, HK$302 million is to be paid in cash.
	   The firm will pay a second instalment of HK$108 million through
an issue of 140 million new ordinary shares at 40 cents each to the
owners at the price of HK$0.78 per share. This represents a premium
of about 204 per cent to the average closing price of the company's
shares over the 10 previous trading days.
	   The balance of HK$116 million is to be satisfied through the
issue of a zero-coupon note.
	   About HK$271 million of the cash consideration will be sourced
through bank borrowings, while the balance of HK$31 million will
come from internal resources.
	   Lee Howe-yong, China Development Corp director, said the
purchase should benefit and increase the value of the company. He
said the firm intends to hold the property as long-term investment.
	   ``Hawaii has historically lagged behind the mainland of the US
in terms of economic growth.
	   However, in view of the robust and thriving US economy, it is
anticipated that Hawaii's economy should see a turnaround and enjoy
good growth prospects,'' Mr Lee said.
	   The 577,124 square-foot property, the Executive Centre, is a
leasehold condominium project.
	   The project comprises 511 residential and office, penthouse,
town house, and commercial units, as well as 864 parking spaces.

Palestinian cabinet calls for int'l sanctions against Israel, THE INDEPENDENT

	   The Palestinian cabinet called on Saturday international
sanctions to be slapped on Israel to punish it for its hard line in
the deadlocked Middle East peace process. 'We ask that the
international community take economic and political measures
against Israel to penalise the arrogant policy of its government,''
the cabinet said in a statement after its weekly meeting. The
statement was issued as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was
holding talks with leaders of the United Arab Emirates as part of a
diplomatic push to gain support for an Arab summit on the
deadlocked peace talks.
	   'European, American and Arab efforts to revive the process have
led nowhere because of the Israeli government's policy, which does
not respect international resolutions and accords signed with the
Palestinians.'' The statement also lambasted Israel for its
continued settlement polices, particularly in annexed east
Jerusalem, saying they would 'lead to an explosion.'' Israel's
decision in March last year to start work on a large new Jewish
settlement in east Jerusalem, which the Jewish state occupied and
annexed in 1967, led to the current impasse in peace negotiations.
	   In a bid to break the deadlock, Washington is pushing Israel to
hand over another 13 per cent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule,
in tandem with Palestinian measures against terrorism, but Israel
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a troop withdrawal of that
size would threaten Israel's security. 'The Israeli government has
shown its true face by refusing the proposals of the Untied States,
which is much closer to (Israel's) stance than ours,'' the
Palestinian cabinet said. Netanyahu returned to Israel on Friday
after his visit to China, and is due to hold a cabinet meeting on
Monday to re-examine the US proposals. And in a continuing
Palestinian push to garner support for an Arab summit designed to
pressure Israel, Arafat was in Abu Dhabi for talks with UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Ibn Sultan Al-Nahayan.
	   Their discussions will cover 'the possibility of holding an
urgent Arab summit to scrutinise the stalled peace process and
efforts to tighten Arab ranks,'' the official Wam news agency said.
The UAE on Wednesday renewed its call for the 'urgent'' convening
of such a summit to try to break the 14-month deadlock, while
Arafat warned of an new outbreak of violence in the occupied
territories over Israel's hardline stance. 'A summit has become a
national necessity to protect the right and the interests of our
Arab nation,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leaders believe the coming week will be decisive for
the success of the eight-month-old US drive to unblock the peace
process, saying Washington knows it cannot ask for more time
without serious resistance form the Arab side. 'The Untied States
knows perfectly well that the Palestinians and Arabs will not agree
to continue any longer with the current situation of uncertainty,''
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told agency. The Palestinians
hope the US initiative will end with Israel accepting US proposals
for a partial pullback form the West Bank or, if Israel continues
to resist, that Washington will make its proposals public and
explain why they have not worked.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The government seized Mexico's largest
airline on Monday after 1,033 unionized flight attendants walked
off the job. Airline officials said the flight schedule was not
interrupted.
	   Members of the Unionized Association of Flight Attendants went
on strike at midnight, saying Aeromexico was unwilling to negotiate
better working conditions and benefits.
	   The government, saying national security was at stake, seized
Aviacion de Mexico, which runs Mexico's largest airline, and
appointed an acting general administrator for the duration of the
strike.
	   ``This action was necessary to guarantee that people have
transportation, and also because many areas of our economy depend
on air transportation and we would have huge economic losses'' if
the flights were all grounded, an official at the transportation
secretariat said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Under Mexico's constitution, the government can temporarily
seize companies considered vital to the nation's economy or
security so that they can continue to operate during emergencies.
	   All flights were operating normally Monday, according to the
airline. Replacement workers filled in for the strikers.
	   The government planned to fly as many planes as possible with
Aeromexico's 300 nonunionized flight attendants, and said 12
airlines that have agreements with Aeromexico would reschedule some
of the passengers.
	   If the strike drags on, the government spokesman said, the
government will train new flight attendants.
	   The union said, 9th graf pvs.

Restructure tariffs to keep water flowing, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   THE shortage of potable water and the resulting need to ration
has been attributed to nature and is thought to be a short-term
problem. Once the weather turns around, it is argued, we will have
plenty of rain in the catchment areas and households will once
again have abundant supply to use as they please.
	   In many cases there may be more than enough water and it is
justified to waste the resource because it is free and a gift from
God and no government has the right to charge more than a nominal
fee for its use.
	   Some countries that promoted this ideology now find themselves
with inadequate supply because of increased salinisation and
alkalisation of water.
	   While raw water is free, treated water is not. Raw water is
generally not fit for consumption because if it is, we will not
have a water crisis.
	   We have a crisis because we are short of treated water.
	   While the supply of raw water is driven by nature, that of
treated water is not necessarily so. Otherwise countries like the
Maldives and Dubai, which have low levels of rainfall would be out
of treated water.
	   The first thing to do to get out of the crisis is to distinguish
between raw and treated water.
	   We can have adequate supply of treated water even in an
environment where there is very little rainfall provided we are
able to manage water resources efficiently. The crisis is not due
to nature but to the ``command and control'' type of water
management we have inherited from the colonial days.
	   We would not be facing a shortage if we had an efficient system
of capturing, storing, treating and distributing water. As it is
about 40 per cent of treated water is lost because the distribution
pipes are old or leaking.
	   We may even have problems locating these pipes because of the
absence of maps. If this ``lost'' water was distributed to
households we may not have such a severe crisis.
	   However, to repair or replace the pipes requires money and the
present water charges may be inadequate to cover the costs. Just
like the modernisation of our electricity and telephone industries
and transport system, we need to invest in the water treatment and
distribution system to insure against a recurrence of the crisis.
	   There may be some protests about raising water rates considering
the current economic situation, but if you ask people who have been
without water for 17 days how much they are willing to pay for
treated water, they will tell you ``quite a lot''.
	   Maybe we should base rates on people's ``willingness to pay''.
Some Malaysians have been paying as much as RM20 for a day's supply
of treated water during the crisis while others have been giving
the Waterworks Department only RM21 for two-month supply. This is
definitely inequitable.
	   It is obvious that those not affected by the crisis are deriving
a surplus - i.e. the difference between what people are ``willing
to pay'' and what they are ``actually paying''. Therefore, it is
time to negotiate a new social contract between the Government and
people to ensure predictable and reliable supply of treated water
based on rates or prices that reflect the scarcity of the resource.
The contract will have to be consistent with the sustainable
development of water resources.
	   To sustain the development of water resources there must be
enough money. Some will argue that the Government can rely on taxes
but as the crisis amply shows, tax revenues are insufficient to
meet this need.
	   To treat and distribute water involves several costs. These
include the purchase of capital goods, labour, materials and also
environmental costs.
	   These are all opportunity costs because the same resources can
be used to build schools, universities, hospitals and a host of
other things that can enhance the standard of living.
	   There is therefore a need to recover the costs of developing
water resources through pricing. Otherwise there will not be enough
funds to maintain, renew and expand facilities for an expanding
population.
	   To ensure an adequate and reliable supply of treated water, it
may be necessary to have a self-financing water resources
development policy rather than rely on dwindling tax revenue.
	   Efficient allocation will equate the price of a unit of water
with the extra cost incurred in producing it. In the economist's
jargon, marginal cost must be equated with marginal revenue. If
marginal revenue is less than marginal cost then the Government
will have to subsidise water supply and we may run into problems
again if tax revenues fall below expectations.
	   However, in a caring society this type of economic calculation
may not be acceptable. The poor may not be perceived as able to pay
as much as is needed to ensure predictable supply of treated water.
To safeguard their needs, a ``lifeline'' rate can be introduced.
	   What can be done is to estimate the minimum consumption of a
family of five or six - the ``lifeline'' requirement. A low rate,
even a subsidised one can be charged for this minimum essential.
	   However, consumption beyond the lifeline requirement may be
heavily taxed on a steep tariff structure. This way those who waste
treated water or use it for non-essential purposes are heavily
penalised and made to subsidise the consumption of the poor. This
tariff structure can be designed to recover all the costs of
developing water resources and at the same time generate sufficient
revenue to promote sustainable development.
	   Such a tariff structure will also provide incentives to conserve
because it will become more and more expensive to waste treated
water. Thus, there may not be a need to build more dams, reservoirs
and treatment plants.
	   This will not only preserve the environment from depletion and
degradation but also save the taxpayers' money.
	   Maybe it is time to think of treated water as a scarce commodity
having attributes that are desired and valued and that are
necessary to develop a healthy population. It is also time to
discard the old view that treated water is free, cheap, in abundant
supply and can be wasted.
	   It is also time to manage it as a scarce commodity and to price
it according to how much people are ``willing to pay''. A good time
to evaluate the population's ``willingness to pay'' is when there
is a crisis.
	   In a number of countries where surveys have been done, the
people's estimate of their own ``willingness to pay'' for treated
water has been much higher than the politicians'. It is also time
to get the community actively involved in planning and designing
its treated water supply requirements to ensure that the crisis
does not recur.

Former Zimbabwe president goes on trial on sex charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Former President Canaan Sodindo Banana
went on trial Monday on two charges of sodomy, three charges of
attempted sodomy and six of indecent assault.
	   Prosecutor Augustine Chigumira claimed Banana repeatedly lured
soldiers, aides and security men to his quarters for sex, and had
them punished if they rejected his overtures.
	   Banana, 62, an ordained Methodist minister and ceremonial head
of state from 1980-1988, pleaded not guilty.
	   Wearing a green ``Mao'' suit he adopted in his heyday as a
radical black liberation theologian, Banana arrived at the High
Court in a chauffeur-driven purple Mercedes Benz limousine with his
wife Janet.
	   Carrying a walking stick painted with the Zimbabwean national
colors of red, green, black and gold, Banana smiled for cameramen
and took his place impassively in the dock.
	   The case poses political embarrassment to his successor and
associate, President Robert Mugabe. Before the scandal broke last
year, Mugabe said gays are ``lower than pigs or dogs'' and should
have ``no rights at all'' in Zimbabwe.
	   The prosecution claims top political figures and military
commanders covered up Banana's homosexual indiscretions.
	   Vice President Simon Muzenda and Justice Minister Emmerson
Mnangagwa are expected to testify.
	   Defense attorney Chris Andersen asserted that any sexual
intimacy took place with consent.
	   But the prosecutor said the opposite occurred. He said one young
guard, ordered to escort Banana on a tour of the grounds of the
presidential residence, threw the president into the swimming pool
to escape his advances.
	   Eleven people will be alleging at the trial they were victims of
Banana's advances, court officials said.

	   Now that both India and Pakistan have emerged as nations with
demonstrable nuclear capability, the task before the international
community is to bring them back to the path of sanity. India's five
tests and Pakistan's six in defiance of the universal call for
exercising restraint have turned the region into a fertile ground
for using the weapons of mass destruction, which can only mean
incalculable misfortune for their impoverished people.
	   So the reality is that the world will have to live with two more
countries having the ability to mop up millions in a few minutes if
they ever decide on doing so. That alone should suffice to remove
all doubts that anyone might still have regarding the need for
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. But when the cloud
is already looming large on the horizon, the only way to avert a
major disaster is to defuse tension. Both India and Pakistan should
be persuaded to sign the CTBT which should help eliminate the
possibility of a nuclear conflict and prevent further advancement
of the two countries' weapons programmes
	   That might sound like setting too modest and limited an
objective; but as things stand now, it is difficult to see how else
the threat of a nuclear conflagration can be dealt with. The Indian
argument that the CTBT is discriminatory in the sense that it does
not cut both ways has its point, since it can stop only horizontal
expansion of the nuclear armoury, giving the countries already in
possession of nuclear arms an undue advantage. If a nuclear-free
world is what we are striving for, the rules should apply equally
to all .Then come the punitive sanctions already imposed by the
United States and Japan. These will, of course, hit the economies
of India and Pakistan rather hard. And the poor people will have to
bear the brunt of it all.
	   True, the donor countries have few options, but ordinary people
should not be made to pay a high price for the decisions made by
their governments. The stirred up popular sentiments are by no
means an indication that people have lost faith in peace, rather
the celebrations in India and Pakistan following the nuclear tests
only showed that plebeians, blinded by gut patriotism, were indeed
not capable of judging everything critically.

	   A number of reports published in newspapers coming from various
coastal districts of Bangladesh suggest that our fishermen living
off the sea are experiencing a unique situation of elusive catches.
The coastal waters appear to have been emptied of fish
population.Many thousands of fishing boats and trawlers are
returning empty from the sea after days spent on the waves.
Trawlers fishing in deep sea waters are also complaining that
catches are becoming alarmingly rare.
	   Loss of living spells disaster for lakhs of idle
fishermen.Coastal sea-beds and estuaries provide breeding grounds
for much of the fish population of the Bay. According to reports,
one of the major causes for the vanishing trend of mature fish
catches is the irresponsible netting of fish fry for culture
fishery all along the coast-line. Inadmissible types of nets are
being used for rogue fishing, and fish fry is being caught by
mosquito nets on a massive scale, irreparably impeding the growth
of mature fish population. What is more regrettable is that the
crude methods of catching fish fry for culture is wasteful to the
extent of 80 per cent of the fry being spoilt in the process.
	   The demand for fry could be easily met by adequate hatcheries
that could ensure efficient and adequate supply for the culture
fisheries, if properly set up in appropriate places. Appropriate
management of the economy and environment of our coastal land and
waters in the long belt from Teknaf to Dublar Char, that is capable
of providing among other opportunities a valuable resources of
extensive capture fishing, is a must for our sustainable
development.
	   Besides pollution from sea-lane traffic abuses, it is
irresponsible depletion of immature fish stock and fry that poses a
major threat to the coastal economy. The authorities ought to take
special care to implement laws about breeding season bans on
sea-fishing, to penalise harmful netting practices, and to ban
commercial catching of fry altogether, in addition to stricter
implementation of pollution controls along and off the coast.

Government survey shows most people worried about jobs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Most Hong Kong people listed unemployment as
one of their main concerns, a government survey said Monday.
	   The survey also showed that only 44 percent of the 1,553
respondents said they were satifised with Hong Kong's present
situtation, the lowest figure ever recorded since the government
began conducting opinion polls in 1983.
	   It said labor-related issues were the main preoccupation of 54
percent of the people interviewed over the telephone in the poll.
	   Housing, which used to be the main concern, was mentioned by
only 30 percent of the people in the latest survey.
	   The poll, which was conducted last month, did not give any
margin of error.
	   On Friday, the government announced that the economy contracted
by 2 percent in the first quarter, the first contraction in almost
13 years. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 3.9 percent.

Supermarkets get spared, HONGKONG STANDARD

	   THE supermarket business remains a bright spot in an otherwise
gloomy retail market.
	   Sales continue to clock positive growth even as the economy
shrinks. After all, there are essentials in life.
	   Although the Hong Kong economy has registered negative growth _
the first time in 13 years _ neither of Hong Kong's two biggest
supermarket chains, Park 'N Shop and Wellcome, are about to scrap
plans to open more big stores this year.
	   The basic cause of the first-quarter slump has been less
consumer spending, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of Hong
Kong's gross domestic product.
	   Despite the downturn, Park 'N Shop managing director Logan
Taylor believes this is the time for investment in the future.
	   The chain, he said, was opening five more ``Super Stores'' this
year as part of an expansion program that would see the present
chain of 173 stores expanding to 180.
	   Rival Wellcome is similarly on a course of expansion. Marketing
manager Lewis McMullen said the firm would open 10 more stores this
year.
	   Wellcome currently has 120 stores and employs 5,000. More staff
would be needed for the expansion, he said.
	   Economic gloom had no direct negative impact on business growth,
he said. Indeed, he added, because the prices of the company's
products were already very low, it was a good time for increasing
market share.
	   Also, the economic slump has brought massive cost reductions in
terms of rents.
	   Retail analyst Debbie Lau said both supermarkets were expanding
to take advantage of low rents that have significantly reduced
operating costs.
	   The retail sector slump has meant rents plunging up to 30 per
cent in prime locations.
	   Yet rents continued to account for a huge chunk of Park 'N Shop
operating cost, Mr Taylor said.
	   Benefits of lower rents varied from place to place, he said.
	   The super-store trend, Mr Taylor said, was to meet the demand
for one-stop shopping. The range of products offered in a Super
Store would range from daily grocery needs to wet-market features
with seafood and freshwater fish.
	   The new stores were long-term investments that promised solid
returns, according to Miss Lau.
	   The supermarket sector was more stable than other retail
sectors. She noted that while other businesses were slumping,
supermarkets had seen constant sales growth of 7 per cent to 8 per
cent in recent years.
	   ``We anticipate, for instance, that Wellcome supermarket will
see a 7.6-per-cent sales growth in the next two years despite the
downturn,'' Ms Lau said.
	   And the Asian financial crisis has had only a minimal effect on
the supermarket sector. ``After the regional turmoil, the
supermarket sector is more competitive than other retail sectors,
such as fashion,'' Mr Taylor said.
	   ``The crisis had less of an effect on food retailers than other
retailers, but it has changed the consumption habits of grocery
buyers.'' Shoppers were now focusing more on basic commodities
rather than on luxury or snack foods, Mr Taylor said.
	   And the slowdown has meant people are dining out less.
	   The Super Store approach was the way of the future for Park 'N
Shop, as Mr Taylor saw it.
	   By the end of this year, 25 per cent of sales revenue would be
generated by Super Stores, he said.
	   ``We will open one store in Lam Tin's Sceneway Plaza with a size
of 30,000 square feet, a 35,000-sq-ft store in Festival Walk,
Kowloon Tong, and a 30,000-sq-ft store in the former Wing On store
basement in the Hopewell Centre.'' Opening a 25,000-sq-ft store
would mean an investment of $15 million to $20 million, Mr Taylor
said. And total investment for the current expansion plan would
amount to about $75 million.
	   Profit margins at super stores were lower than at at regular
supermarkets, Mr Taylor added, because of the extensive range of
products, but super stores produced bigger turnover and economies
of scale.
	   Park 'N Shop is also set to undergo an image overhaul with the
arrival of a new company logo.
	   The logo change cost several million dollars, Mr Taylor said,
and it's expected to cover all branded lines within two years.

	   El Nino, the warm ocean current that triggers extreme changes in
weather, is bringing about world-wide droughts that are a worry to
farmers and the general consumer. Latest research reveals El Nino
has been a regular feature of the past, occurring in periodic
cycles.
	   This particular El Nino is so turbulent probably for the global
warming caused by the hole in the ozone layer. Since last year due
to El Nino's influence a drought has been raging in Indonesia.
Man-made fires to clear forests went out of hand with awesome
conflagrations. Numerous precious flora and fauna have perished and
are still perishing. Some, like Borneo's orangutans, survived the
fire to die of starvation, lacking food because of the drought and
the fire.
	   Smoke hung in a haze for months over the region from Singapore
to Borneo, forcing motor vehicles in even teeming metropolitan
cities to use headlights to grope through low visibility. A similar
disaster is befalling the region this year too. And now Mexico,
which has not seen a rain cloud for months, is in the grip of a
fire whose smoke is reaching out in a haze from Houston to Denver
in the USA.
	   The El Nino fallout in Mexico itself is of similar nature: for
instance, millions of Monarch butterflies, who regularly migrate to
Mexico in the winter, are in danger of being wiped out. In
Bangladesh there is the likely onslaught of El Nino on the coming
Aman crop. What is needed in all these countries is regional and
global cooperation for timely weather forecasts alongside disaster
management measures in accordance with the magnitude of the
calamity.

	   LONDON (AP ) _ The o pa1508
	   European Union will hold a two-day trade-boosting meeting with
12 Mediterranean countries in Parlermo, Italy, this week, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, said Monday.
	   Britain, which currently hold the presidency of the EU, will
chair the meeting with foreign ministers from Algeria, Cyprus,
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestinian
Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.
	   The meeting, starting Wednesday, is part of the so-called
Euromed process started at a conference in Barcelona, Spain, in
1995 to boost political, economic and cultural links between the EU
and neighbors on the southern and eastern Mediterranean rim.
	   The aim is to establish a EuroMediterranean free trade area by
2010.

Retransmitting Williams-Hingis rivalry renewed at French Open AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Venus Williams slammed the serve at 185 kph (115
mph, but Ai Sugiyama held up her hand and watched the ball speed
past. The umpire ordered the point replayed.
	   Williams glared at her opponent with a look that seemed to
scream, ``Are you ready NOW?'' Then the 17-year-old American
responded with a 190 kph (118 mph) service winner.
	   That may be the question for top-seeded Martina Hingis as she
prepares to play Williams in the quarterfinals of the French Open
on Tuesday, their fifth encounter already this year.
	   The rivalry between Hingis and Williams is becoming one of the
best in women's sports. Though it evokes hints of the Chris
Evert-Martina Navratilova duels of the 1980s, it has the potential
to become much more bitter off the court.
	   Hingis becomes downright haughty when discussing Williams, whom
she says has not yet earned the right to consider herself part of a
great rivalry.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
said. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
tournament on clay, responded diplomatically when told of Hingis'
comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, including a 6-0, 6-4
win in the final of the U.S. Open last summer in their only
previous Grand Slam meeting.
	   They are 2-2 this year, with Williams winning on hard courts in
Sydney and in the semifinals of the Lipton Championships in Key
Biscayne. But Hingis won their only career encounter on clay,
capturing the final of the Italian Open in three sets in mid-May.
	   ``It was a good victory for me there to beat her in three sets
in the final of a big tournament,'' Hingis said. ``I hope she will
remember that, too.''
	   Hingis and Williams have eased through the first four rounds of
the French Open. Hingis has lost just 14 games while averaging 56
minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and averaged 58
minutes per match.
	   Hingis said she has every reason to feel she has an edge over
Williams heading into the match.
	   ``Well, why shouldn't I?'' she asked. ``I'm No. 1, I've won four
Grand Slams. I have the self-confidence.''
	   While Hingis is the master strategist, moving opponents around
the court with precise groundstrokes until she has set up a winning
shot, Williams relies on power and athleticism to overwhelm foes.
	   Those contrasting styles bring back memories of Evert, the
baseline strategist, and Navratilova, the powerful
serve-and-volleyer. They enjoyed their on-court duels and an
off-court friendship.
	   But the Hingis-Williams matchup is not a friendly rivalry and,
if Hingis is to be believed, not yet even a rivalry.
	   All that could change on Tuesday.

Eds: ADDS new items on Nigeria squad; French midfielder Youri
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ In the wake of Nigeria's convincing 3-0
loss to Yugoslavia, many fans of the Super Eagles are clamoring for
a goalkeeper purge.
	   Radio talk shows and daily newspapers were filled Monday with
condemnation for the performance of goalkeeper Abiodun Baruwa, who
allowed in all three goals in the Friday match.
	   Many fans called for the return of Peter Rufai, who plays for
Spanish side Deportivo La Cornua, to the number one spot on
Nigeria's World Cup-bound squad.
	   Former national team captain Segun Odegbami said goalkeeping was
merely part of a larger problem _ growing team apathy.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff says France's
public recognition of the 1915 genocide of ethnic Armenians in
Turkey inspired his spectacular goal in a 2-2 draw against Morocco
last week.
	   Djorkaeff, whose mother is Armenian, said he came on as
substitute determined to score after hearing the news that
lawmakers had passed a motion recognizing as ``genocide'' the
deaths of 1.5 million Armenians.
	   If the Senate also passes the motion, France would become the
first major European country to recognize the genocide. The motion
drew strong protests last week from Turkey.
	   ``It was a great day for me because France acknowledged the
genocide of Armenians,'' Djorkaeff said in an interview published
Monday with sports daily L'Equipe.
	   ``I thought of it as I went onto the pitch. I wanted to do
something special, and that's how goals like that are scored.''
	   Djorkaeff, who plays for Italy's Inter Milan, equalized for
France with less than 20 minutes to go, scoring a stunning overhead
kick that gave the goalkeeper no chance. France then lost on
penalties in the final match of the King Hassan II tournament.
	   ___  
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav Coach Slobodan Santrac on
Monday dropped striker Anto Drobnjak and midfielder Albert Nadj
from Yugoslavia's 22-man World Cup squad.
	   Drobjak, of French champion's Lens, and Nadj, of Betis in Spain,
will not travel to France, where Yugoslavia faces the United
States, Germany and Iran in the preliminary rounds.
	   Nadj reportedly had a row with Santrac before Yugoslavia's
friendly warm-up with Nigeria last Friday which the Yugoslav team
won 3-0.
	   Nadj had allegedly refused to start the game on defense, rather
than his usual position in the midfield.
	   Santrac had a large choice of strikers and Drobnjak lost his
place in competition with Predrag Mijatovic and Darko Kovacevic.
	   The Yugoslav team up front includes forwards Predrag Mijatovic,
Savo Milosevic, Darko Kovacevic, Perica Ognjenovic.
	   ___  
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff is aiming for Ronaldo yet
again.
	   Bierhoff held off the Brazilian star in the race for scoring
champion in the just-concluded Serie A season and says he can do
the same at the World Cup.
	   ``I have always looked for a rival as a point of reference. Even
as a boy,'' the German told Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday. ``It
gave me the motivation to commit myself. Hopefully I can beat
Ronaldo again _ at the World Cup and in the league.''
	   Bierhoff tallied 27 goals for third-place Udinese this season,
while Ronaldo had 25 for runner-up Inter Milan. They'll be
neighbors next year, though, with Bierhoff having transferred to AC
Milan.
	   ___  
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Tunisian coach Henri Kasperczak Monday
announced his squad for the World Cup, including four
European-based players he hopes will give the team vital
international experience.
	   It will be the second time Tunisia has played in a World Cup,
coming 20 years after its debut in Argentina. Many observers say
the current squad is the most talented Tunisia has ever fielded.
	   Kasperczak, from Poland, chose four players from European
leagues: striker Adel Sellimi of Spanish second division team Jaen,
the Freiburg (Germany) duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mahdi Ben Slimane,
and France's Bastia goalkeeper Ali Bou Mnijel.
	   Tunisia is in the same group as Romania, England and Colombia.
	   ___  
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ On Germany's team of oldies, whose
average age is over 30, one new face may have cracked the starting
lineup.
	   Defensive midfielder Jens Jeremies, the team's baby at 24,
turned in an outstanding performance in the European champion's 3-1
victory over Colombia Saturday.
	   ``Our best player was our youngster Jens,'' coach Berti Vogts
said. ``The way he worked for (offensive midfielders) Andreas
Moeller and Thomas Haessler, how he gave commands and stripped
players of the ball _ that impressed me a lot.''
	   Jeremies played for 1860 Munich last season and will transfer to
cross-town rival Bayern Munich next season.

	   LAST week, I discussed the different factors that affect risk
tolerance and profiled the characteristics of an aggressive
investor.
	   This time, we'll look at the three other investment
personalities: dynamic, moderate and conservative, and how they
approach investment risk.
	   Dynamic Jason Won is a 32-year-old bachelor with a monthly
income of $40,000 who lives with his parents in a 700 sq-ft flat in
Tai Koo Shing. Jason is one of the lucky people who can live
comfortably with his parents.
	   But Jason is well aware of the need to save for his future.
Because he is young, affluent and has virtually no financial
responsibilities, he could probably be categorised as a dynamic
investor who would select high-to-moderate risk investments with
the potential for high return over the long term.
	   This type of investors tends to favour a mix of investments that
offers different risk levels and returns.
	   They buy stocks in emerging markets such as South America and
Southeast Asia, and stocks in developed markets such as the United
States and Europe.
	   They usually have invested in individual stocks and mutual funds
and are knowledgeable about financial markets.
	   Moderate David So is a 39-year-old restaurant general manager
with a monthly income of $30,000. He has just paid off his mortgage
on a 650 sq-ft apartment in Lam Tin, Kowloon, where he lives with
his wife and their two children, aged 10 and five. To supplement
his income, David occasionally works part-time as a taxi driver.
	   Now nearing middle age. David is well aware of the need to save
for retirement. As the family's sole breadwinner, he probably isn't
keen on taking big risk.
	   Thus, he could be categorised as a moderate investor who would
adopt a middle-of-the-road strategy that will protect him but not
make him wealthy.
	   He categorises his investments into short term-high risk and
long term-low risk. He accepts moderate changes in the value of his
investments and takes calculated risk.
	   People like David prefer a balanced mix of investments that
includes blue-chip stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
	   These investments generally provide a moderate return over the
long term, and David likes the sense of security and stability his
investments bring.
	   Conservative James Chan is a 47-year-old supermarket manager
with a monthly income of $35,000. He owns a 450 sq-flat in Tai Po,
in the New Territories, which he bought more than 20 years ago.
Recently widowed, James has three teenage children, aged 13, 14 and
16, to support.
	   Because of his age, his moderate income and financial
responsibilities for his children, James should adopt a
conservative, or risk averse, approach to investing.
	   His savings should be put into low-risk but safe investments.
	   But James is by nature a risk taker and a gambler. He bets on
horses and regularly visits casinos in Macau. When he invests, he
buys highly speculative stocks such as little-known mainland
industrial stocks and Indonesian mining and energy shares.
	   James made money during the Hong Kong stock market bull run of
1993, but lately he has been hurt by the market downturn.
	   It is people like James who especially need the discipline of a
provident fund scheme.
	   I hope he will select one that will provide solid management to
help him save for his retirement because he'll probably need it.
	   Now that we've looked at the four types of investment
personalities, maybe you can decide your type.
	   There is a Chinese saying: ``Know yourself and your enemy and
you will win every battle.'' And knowing your investment
personality will help you in your retirement plan. As with most
things, you need to plan ahead to get ahead and achieve the results
you want.
	   In retirement planning, you need to ask yourself: ``How much do
I need to retire comfortably?'' That depends on a lot of factors _
current salary, lifestyle, how many working years you have before
retirement, assets, the rate of your investment return, your
philosophy toward risk. We'll start talking about these next week.

	   BANGI, Sun. - The Government will continue the policy of
intervention in market forces to help Bumiputera businessmen,
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said today.
	   He said the policy of intervention by providing funds and
awarding licences and contracts to Bumiputera entrepreneurs would
be continued to ensure fair distribution of wealth.
	   The policy was necessary as Bumiputeras were still handicapped
in business and would be marginalised if left to market forces, he
told reporters after launching the Kelab Wawasan Melayu Malaysia.
	   Also present at the launch were pro-tem club president Datuk
Shukor Raja Idris, deputy president Datin Faridah Mohd Said and
about 200 members.
	   Mustapa said in the 1960s and 1970s, such interventions were
necessary as Malays were not able to compete with non-Malays due to
low income and lack of a level playing field.
	   In education, he said, similar interventions had caused
Bumiputeras to be on par with other races, but the 30 per cent
share equity for Bumiputeras in business had yet to be achieved.
	   On business opportunities in the face of the negative growth of
1.8 per cent announced by by Bank Negara for the first quarter of
this year, Mustapa said this was only short-term.
	   He said the Government was consolidating the national economy
and was confident it would recover in the long term.
	   The long-term prospects for recovery were good and entrepreneurs
should not be discouraged by the figures, added Mustapa.
	   Shukor, who is group executive chairman of Warga Mantap Group,
said the club, with an estimated membership of 3,000 nationwide,
would act as a voice for entrepreneurs in small- and medium-sized
businesses.
	   He said the club would assist Malay entrepreneurs aged 18 and
above deal with problems in their businesses brought about by the
economic slowdown.
	   A businessman based in Australia, Shukor said he decided to
return home to invest in Malaysia and expressed confidence the
economy would recover.

	   As part of the race for nuclear superiority in the
sub-continent, Pakistan detonated a total of six nuclear devices on
Thursday and Saturday - five on Thursday. BBC television showed
pictures of excited people eating sweetmeat on the streets of
Pakistani towns and villages and celebrating as Nawaz Sharif
addressed the nation on Thursday saying: ``We have settled the
account of the nuclear blasts by India. Today we have successfully
carried out five tests.'' He went on to add that Pakistan had to
carry out the nuclear tests because the world community had ``...
not done anything effective to make India realise its mistake.''
	   Predictably enough Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
said that these tests by Pakistan had vindicated' India's decision
to test its nuclear devices. Immediately after Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's announcements, the Pakistani President announced a State
of Emergency suspending the Pakistani Constitution. All these chain
of events leading from the testing of Pakistan's missile Ghauri,
India's nuclear tests, and now Pakistan's nuclear tests, with its
declaration of emergency points definitely to a situation of
belligerent confrontation between India and Pakistan.
	   In fact Saturday's test by Pakistan came as an anti-climax, with
Pakistan claiming all these to be part of a complete series
comprising six detonations.Both Nawaz Sharif, on his election in
February '97, and Atal Behari Vajpayee on becoming the Prime
Minister of India in March, had stressed the importance of
normalising relations between the two countries. In fact, when
Sharif assumed Prime Ministership, it was seen that the voters were
clearly in favour of better relations between the two countries and
that they wanted to see India and Pakistan as trading partners
rather than warring neighbours. In Pakistan 54% of the country's
voters were below 40, and animosity towards India and memories of
the partition are a matter of the history books to them in this age
of liberalisation.
	   However both Indian and Pakistani citizens were seen rejoicing
after the tests, irrespective of age. The latest situation has
raised concerns in the SAARC countries and the rest of Asia
including China. President Jiang Zemin of China is supposed to have
written to Nawaz Sharif to refrain from nuclear tests. Indian tests
have been on a circumspect note, but now the news that the
Pakistani missile Ghauri would be deployed with nuclear warheads
makes that country a step ahead in the chessboard moves of
belligerence. Can the two countries be now prevailed upon not to
deploy these weapons?
	   Bangladesh has forcefully stated its commitment to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and its belief that the security of
the region lies in its economic strength rather than military
power, and now nuclear power. Bangladesh and the other SAARC
countries now have the responsibilities to bring back India and
Pakistan from the brink of war, whether conventional or nuclear,
for the sake of real economic and social development in the region.
The impending SAARC summit in Colombo-advanced by about ten
days-may well serve as an important forum for a positive defusing
of the situation.
	   On the other hand if the efforts of the SAARC leaders cannot
modify the stance taken by India and Pakistan, this will be a very
dangerous situation spelling future complications in the region as
well as for the alliance. In case of an actual war between India
and Pakistan the physical well being of Bangladesh and the
remaining SAARC nations will be, needless to say, greatly
endangered. Reference is always made in international situations of
this seriousness and urgency, to the need of the United States to
exercise leadership in the world community, to assume its
leadership role. For decades the Indian sub-continent had been on
the back burner of America's external concerns.
	   Now President Bill has turned the heat up, by his stern approach
to sanctions against both India and Pakistan. The tense situation
now because of the nuclear tests and that in Kashmir are now
definitely seen as urgent problems, and a time for activism in
South Asia. Clinton had also in the past referred to the Kashmir
problem between the two countries in his UN speech in September
1993, when he said: ``Bloody ethnic, religious and civil wars
raging from Angola to the Caucasus to Kashmir.'' However both
Indians and Pakistanis have slated the US attitudes as being
favourable to the opposing side. The attention of the largest and
the militarily most dominant of the former imperial powers,
naturally arouses the fears of some imperial residuum. In 1994,
after the testing of India's missile Prithvi, Bill Clinton sent his
diplomatic trouble-shooter, deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbot
to broker deals that could begin to curb the nuclear arms race in
the sub-continent.
	   At that time neither the Pakistanis, nor the Indians bought
Talbot's line completely. But both responded in a sufficiently
positive manner for the American to say before leaving for the US
from Islamabad: ``Much remains to be done on non-proliferation, but
much was accomplished.'' Pakistan was then amenable to the US
proposals on the non-proliferation conference and the
non-deployment of the missiles. But while Islamabad seemed
agreeable to a cap on production of missile material, it would not
concede on-site inspections of its nuclear facilities.
	   As for India, it did not respond immediately on the missile
deployment issue, but Indian officials agreed in private to the
non-proliferation talks. In only four years since April 1994, the
situation has moved beyond the ambit of that bid of the US to
defuse Indo-Pakistani nuclear tensions. In the case of India
military decisions such as the present one of exploding nuclear
devices is mainly in the hands of its political leadership. In
Pakistan the military and the establishment has also an important
say besides the politicians, and add to that the elements of it
being the smaller country also wrestling with the contentious bone
of Kashmir, and the US and the other developed countries may find
it more difficult to convince Pakistan than India in turning back
from the preparations and exercises of a nuclear confrontation.
	   Analysts have also indicated an interesting angle inasmuch as
the development of the nuclear bomb by Pakistan maybe the
indications of a future Islamic' bomb which may present a threat to
Israel. The UN, while deploring the tests by both India and
Pakistan have offered personal mediation through Kofi Annan.
Britain, the current chairman of G-8 has called an emergency
meeting of the group, and included-significantly enough-China as a
special guest in the deliberations on the nuclear scenario in the
sub-continent. It is also time that both the remaining SAARC
countries, possibly at the behest of Bangladesh, and the
Non-Aligned Movement countries take emergency steps.
	   The power of the military to assert need and acquire the
requisite financial support is evident in a great measure in the
legislative branches of both these countries. There, subject to
minor symbolic changes, the military budget is voted automatically,
and in recent years with annual increases. It is not even thought
necessary that some military needs-intelligence operations,
sophisticated nuclear weapons-be known to the legislative body as a
whole and thus to the public at large. More important, perhaps, and
particularly in the present case, is the reassuring manifestation
of patriotism in supporting the armed forces. The authority of the
military in establishing national military priorities has thus
become complete. This is a circumstance that has to be conceded and
considered in any approach towards a negotiated cessation of
hostilities and the arms race.
	   Furthermore the State of Emergency in Pakistan will preclude any
overt domestic discussion and debate about this nuclear war
preparations. Whether India will follow suit in like manner is yet
to be seen. However Vajpayee has again reiterated his offer to hold
talks with Sharif on all issues including nuclear arms and Kashmir.
Above all this, on the domestic scene in both the countries, there
were and there remain the insistent claims of the poor and the
impoverished, in the cities and the villages. Whatever the external
threats, there was and there is still the danger of an abrupt and
violent challenge to domestic tranquillity if military needs
continue to control the resources that, if used for basic income
support, job creation, housing, education, health and social care,
would ease the crisis within the countries.
	   It has been said about the Soviet Union that it was impoverished
precisely because it concentrated its resources on preparing for a
war that would never be fought. If they had been used on public
welfare, then the country may have shown the world the superiority
of its socialist way of life. A couple of years back, Sherbaz
Mazari commented on Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto: ``He was more anti-Indian
than pro-poor.'' Now we have to see whether Sharif and Vajpayee are
more anti-each other, or pro-poor in their respective countries.

American women thrive in Paris 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Corretja advancing in new 28th graf
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The American men may have bombed out at this year's
French Open, but the women are doing just fine, thank you.
	   With Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles all
advancing Sunday, more U.S. women have reached the quarterfinals
than in any French Open since 1986.
	   They were almost joined by the other Williams sister, Serena.
But she folded in the second set of a contentious match against
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario after coming within two points of victory.
	   ``I'm only 16, my first Roland Garros,'' Serena said after the
match. ``Everything is a learning experience for me.''
	   That may be the one thing Sanchez Vicario agreed with.
	   ``I taught her a lesson,'' the fourth-seeded Spaniard said
angrily after the match.
	   It was a lesson that featured glares across the net, an unusual
dress change by the Spaniard, and a slam by Williams that nearly
beheaded her opponent.
	   Williams accused Sanchez Vicario of changing from a black outfit
to a white one midway through the second set as a strategic move.
Sanchez Vicario, for her part, was upset at Williams' attitude
after a controversial point in the first set.
	   ``I just think she doesn't have respect. She cannot go in with
that attitude,'' said Sanchez Vicario. ``You know, I'm glad I beat
her.''
	   So Serena will have to watch her sister in the quarters, and it
should be one of the most intriguing matches of the tournament.
	   Venus Williams will play top-seeded Martina Hingis, another
match in a rivalry quickly becoming one of the best in women's
sports.
	   The older Williams advanced Sunday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in which she slammed seven aces _ two
at 116 mph.
	   Hingis was a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Anna Smashnova of Israel in a
match between former French Open junior champions.
	   Venus Williams, the No. 8 seed, has lost just 13 games in her
four matches at the French Open. Hingis has lost 14 games.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, but they are 2-2
this year.
	   Sanchez Vicario will face Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals.
No. 2 Davenport and No. 6 Seles also advanced to the quarters.
	   Davenport will face defending champion Iva Majoli, the 10th
seed, who ousted No. 7 Conchita Martinez 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (3-7), 6-3
in a match completed today.
	   Majoli and Martinez were tied at a set apiece when darkness
halted play Sunday night. Martinez jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead
in the third set, then lost the last five games.
	   Seles will face No. 3 Jana Novotna, who defeated No. 13 Anna
Kournikova 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-3 in another match halted Sunday
night. The match was stopped with Novotna leading 4-2 in the final
set. It took Novotna just 12 minutes to finish off the match
Monday.
	   Play was halted Sunday night at Novotna's request, which left
Kournikova in tears because she had made the same request a game
earlier, but was denied.
	   According to international tennis rules, a match can be halted
due to darkness only on an even-number game in a set.
	   ``It was very difficult for me to play the match over two
days,'' Kournikova said. ``It was a new experience for me.''
	   Seles, a three-time champion who never has lost before the
quarterfinals in Paris, won 6-1, 6-4 over Chanda Rubin.
	   As the second week of the tournament gets started, the women's
side appears to have a bit of everything.
	   There's power and attitude in Venus Williams, the world's No. 1
player in Hingis, and a touching story in Seles, who is playing
only two weeks after losing her coach and father.
	   What's left on the men's side?
	   Certainly not many of the world's top players. With 12 men left
in the draw, only No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios remains of the top 10.
The next seed left is No. 12 Carlos Moya. Then there's No. 14 Alex
Corretja, No. 15 Felix Mantilla and No. 16 Alberto Berasategui.
	   Corretja moved into the quarterfinals Monday with a 6-4, 6-4,
6-3 win over Jason Stoltenberg of Australia.
	   Also remaining are the world's 45th-ranked player, the 69th and
the 116th.
	   No U.S. man made it through the third round, the worst showing
in a Grand Slam event in at least 30 years.
	   Gone are the reigning champions of the other three Grand Slams:
top-seeded Pete Sampras (Wimbledon), No. 2 Petr Korda (Australian
Open) and No. 4 Pat Rafter (U.S. Open).
	   Also gone are some of the more charismatic players, such as
American Andre Agassi and last year's surprise champion, Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil.
	   The remaining marquee player, Rios, has a huge following in
Chile, and his fans bring gigantic Chilean flags to his matches.
But in the rest of the world, he is well known for a cold and
haughty attitude.
	   There is one exciting story on the men's side being written by
Marat Safin, the 18-year-old Russian qualifier ranked 116th in the
world, who's beaten Agassi and Kuerten here.
	   Safin powered his way through the first three rounds much like
Williams, with brawn and with aces.
	   He's attracted Kournikova-like attention with his athletic good
looks. And his post-match news conferences resemble those of
Hingis: smiles and jokes.

	   VOLOS, Greece (AP) _ About 4,500 Greek and U.S. military
personnel began training exercises Monday in the northern Aegean
Sea.
	   The NATO allies plan amphibious landings as well as joint naval
and air force maneuvers, officials said. The exercises, named for
the ancient emperor Alexander The Great, conclude Friday.
	   ``It tests us and trains us on our ability to land troops on the
ground,'' said U.S. Marine Lt. Cmdr. K.J. Braithwaite, part of the
U.S. Sixth Fleet team taking part in the exercises near Volos,
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of Athens.

	   BRITAIN'S Labour Party, when in opposition, was very hostile
towards foreign domiciliaries. Some of the often-quoted policy
documents came from the desk of Gordon Brown, now Chancellor of the
Exchequer. It was not surprising, then that many commentators were
anticipating an all-out assault on the foreign-domiciled community
in the spring Budget.
	   However, this did not materialise.
	   Even the much publicised ``anti-Robinson'' provisions appear to
leave the door open for non-domiciled beneficiaries of offshore
trusts. For the time being at least it seems as though the UK
government still wishes to lay out the ``welcome'' mat for
expatriates into the UK.
	   It is a widely-held view that tax proposals which target
foreigners in the UK are likely to be counter-productive both for
the UK economy and for the yield to the UK Exchequer.
	   There are many wealthy individuals claiming foreign domicile
with substantial private means who live in the UK through choice,
and could just as easily reside elsewhere.
	   Few of them pay significant UK taxes, unless they are poorly
advised or wish to do so, and few would remain in the UK to suffer
under an onerous tax regime.
	   The UK is a popular base for many reasons: but the idea that it
is such an attractive place that large scale tax increases would
not discourage those of foreign domicile and independent means, may
be seriously misconceived.
	   Thus a claim to foreign domicile remains a notable asset for an
individual residing in the UK. Income from foreign sources need
suffer no tax provided proper planning takes place before
importation.
	   This is economically sensible, because to discourage importation
of cash through taxation would probably be counter-productive.
Likewise, capital gains tax may, in most cases, still be avoided
and inheritance tax remains effectively optional for
non-domiciliaries.
	   There are likely to be some cases in which non-domiciliaries
will wish to pay these ``optional taxes'' if, by virtue of UK
residence and our comprehensive network of double taxation
treaties, more severe liabilities may be avoided elsewhere in the
world.
	   One area which did not come off so well is the foreign earnings
deduction, which, in the name of counter avoidance, was abolished.
	   Many representations have been made to the Treasury in respect
of this abolition, and the Inland Revenue has issued a stock draft
response. Broadly it states that the foreign earnings deduction was
introduced to create employment by boosting exports yet ``in
practice, buyers travelling abroad to source for import . . .
benefited to the same extent _ but to the opposite effect''.

Abkhazia criticized Georgian government, asserts independence 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of separatist Abkhazia lashed out
at Georgian leaders Monday, blaming them for recent clashes in the
Black Sea region and insisting that Abkhazia is independent.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian representatives held talks in Moscow
about arranging a meeting between their leaders.
	   But Abkhazian envoy Anri Dzhergenia said such a meeting would
probably not lead to a breakthrough, because Georgia is ``not
ready'' to accept Abkhazia's sovereignty and the breakaway province
would not settle for anything less.
	   Abkhazia declared independence in 1992, and separatists drove
out Georgian troops after 13 months of fighting. Violence has
broken out sporadically since then, despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers. At least 100 people died in the latest fighting that
ended last week.
	   ``We have determined our status, and we are not going to discuss
it with anybody,'' Dzhergenia told reporters.
	   ``We are an independent state,'' he said. ``We don't need
Georgia's recognition ... but life for our people will get easier
when Georgia acknowledges our independence.''
	   Georgia has offered Abkhazia broad autonomy, but Abkhazia
insists it is an independent nation. No other country recognizes
its independence.
	   ``What inspires us is that until the 1960s, many African nations
were in the same situation,'' Dzhergenia said. ``The drive toward
the equality of nations cannot be stopped.''
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze praised the Abkhazian
leadership for not allowing the conflict escalate into a full-scale
war.
	   ``The fact that the clashes in the Ghali region did not grow
into a major war is partly the achievement of the Abkhazians,''
Shevardnadze said in his weekly radio address Monday.
	   But while Shevardnadze blamed the recent fighting on ``certain
forces that want to destabilize the situation,'' Abkhazia said that
the Georgian government was at fault for years of simmering
violence, and for the recent outbreak.
	   ``Among the Georgian leadership _ despite repeated public
statements on the adherence to a peaceful settlement with Abkhazia
_ the disposition toward the use of force is rather strong,''
Dzhergenia said.
	   Dzhergenia also accused Georgia of financing nationalist
guerrilla groups, who oppose Abkhazia's secession and are blamed
for several clashes in the region. More than 150 attacks have been
carried out in the province since a 1993 truce, he said.

	   One of the basic needs of any society is its health care
facilities. This fundamental sector remains to be elusive to the
policy planners in Bangladesh. We are born in poverty, live in
poverty and die there. We have no dearth of policies and their
proper implementation is not beyond anybody's guess. There is no
need of any foreign experts to dig out the lacunas in this sector
nor do we need their valuable advice to formulate and ensure the
appropriate implementation of such a policy.
	   Since independence, no comprehensive national health policy has
been formulated by any of the successive governments. Sources say,
a national policy in this thrust sector is on the anvil by the
present government.
	   The main focus of the health programmes has been on the
provision of primary health care services which has been recognised
as a key approach to attain health for all by the year 2000 AD.The
impediments which contributed to the non-fulfilment of the health
sector development are inefficient project management service,
delay in project management and implementation, frequent changes of
project directors, inadequate inter-project linkages, poor
institutional coordination and support within the sector, lack of
monitoring services, resource constraints etc.Proper medical
facilities do not reach the rural population; even the urban poor
and lower income groups are devoid of any significant medicare
although we have Union Health and Family Welfare Centres, Thana
Health Complexes in majority of the Thanas and hospitals at
district level.
	   In response to the changing health situation of the country,
reforms in health sector particularly in the areas of management
structure, service delivery mechanisms and utilisation of both
public and private sector resources are called for urgently.Will
you believe that there is no echocardiography and exercise
tolerance test machines in Dhaka and Chittagong Medical College
Hospitals? Is it due to negligence of the hospital administration
or paucity of funds? Besides Dhaka, there is only one CT scan
machine in Chittagong, which is also in the private sector. One
physician who had been to UK for a few months told this writer,
what we lack is advanced medical equipment and medicines probably
defending the theory that we have quality physicians in plenty.
	   We have doctors of good quality and its reverse who discharge
their duties to the best of their abilities but unfortunately fail
to satisfy the demands of the millions who look upto them as their
saviours.The medicare facilities in this country are regarded
insufficient and inefficient to the solvent or rich class who
prefer to go abroad to receive better treatment. Most of them
prefer India, Thailand or Singapore. The more solvent ones prefer
Western countries. A simple angiogram is not done skilfully here,
not to speak of a by-pass surgery.
	   Similarly a kidney transplantation is not possible in Bangladesh
for which one has to rush to India. There are other instances in
which the given facilities fail to meet the demands of the
patients. It is estimated that the total amount spent annually by
Bangladeshi patients abroad is a fabulous one which is a huge drain
on the national resources. One way to stop the seeking of foreign
treatment is to strengthen the current services in the country and
to ensure their quality so that the confidence of the citizens in
the country's health services is restored.In recent years, a large
number of private clinics have cropped up in Dhaka and other major
cities.
	   These supplement the government efforts to reach medical
facilities to the people. These clinics being expensive are not
affordable to the lower income groups and the poor segments of the
population. The private health sector is mostly staffed by the
public sector doctors and employees on part-time basis. This is due
to the shortage of medical and health professionals in the country
and to the fact that public sector professionals are allowed to
practise privately.Against this backdrop the government has
recently decided to allow foreign doctors to work in the private
hospitals having 250 beds.
	   This has generated furore among local physicians. Both
Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) and Bangladesh Private Medical
Practitioners Association (BPMA) have strongly opposed the move to
allow foreign doctors in all disciplines in private hospitals. What
they argue is that in the absence of any proper monitoring system,
who will monitor the activities of foreign doctors? They also
apprehend that low graded doctors of foreign countries who get less
opportunities to perform in their respective countries would be
seeing patients here.
	   This theory is not wholly untrue. We do not mind having the
services of skilled foreign doctors. But chances are widely open
that poor quality doctors will come in their guise. Bangladesh
Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) should adopt stringent measures
in issuing registration to foreign physicians.We welcome this move
of the government that would deter us from going to India,
Singapore, UK and USA. A new vista will be opened in health sector
with technology transfer. One group of physicians of our country
supports foreign investment in this vital sector while the other
opposes it. Let us have no squabbling on this issue.
	   Let foreign doctors come and treat us and foreign investment
flows in resulting in the qualitative improvement in health
sector.It may be concluded by stating that the government may
induce the foreign doctors to give their expert opinion in delicate
cases in public sector hospitals in exchange of nominal fees,
enabling the insolvent section of people to have a glimpse of
modern developments in medical science.

	   PDX Infoworld Sdn Bhd has come up with two Internet-based
products after investing RM2 million to develop electronic delivery
systems.
	   The products are HomeBank, which the company claimed is the
first Malaysian Web-based banking application, and i-stock, a
Web-based Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) stock quote service.
	   Both products were launched by the Multimedia Super Corridor
(MSC) status company at the Exposisi Multimedia, Telekomunikasi dan
Electronik Kelantan (EMTEK 1998) event in Tumpat last Friday.
	   HomeBank is aimed at corporate customers while the
subscription-based i- stock is for end users, said PDX Infoworld's
executive director Wong Nan Fay.
	   He said the company is currently negotiating with two local
financial institutions which have expressed interest in HomeBank.
	   According to Wong, HomeBank debut's is timely as the local
financial market is becoming increasingly competitive.
	   ``HomeBank extends secure banking conveniences to users from the
comfort of home and this can be used as a long-term competitive
advantage,'' he said in an interview.
	   HomeBank is Internet-ready but existing financial regulatory
framework does not permit Internet banking.
	   ``We are optimistic that this framework will soon be revised,''
Wong said, adding that HomeBank could be deployed in an intranet
fashion as a temporary measure.
	   HomeBank is a client extension to PDX Infoworld's PayStream
Internet bill presentment and payment solution. It is designed to
enable financial institutions to leverage on existing automated
teller machine (ATM) infrastructure to offer Web-based services.
	   ``This translates into significant cost savings for financial
institutions with relatively minor change needed to expand their
electronic banking services,'' Wong claimed.
	   He likened HomeBank's viability to the ATM in the 1970s.
	   ``The ATM has become a necessity in our daily lives but this was
not the case when it was introduced. We see HomeBank taking the
same form and shape as the ATM.''
	   The solution is expected to be priced at RM1 million per
deployment, comprising a hardware and software Web server using the
Microsoft NT or Unix platform and a database such as Microsoft SQL
or Universal Server.
	   Crucial to HomeBank is its ability to receive and transmit
secure data.
	   As such, the product incorporates authentication devices such as
card readers to receive secure data from the user. Since HomeBank
is compliant with Data Encryption Standard (DES), it is able to
accepts DES-encrypted data generated by these devices, Wong said.
	   HomeBank also transmits secure data packets in native ISO 8583
format.
	   ISO 8583 is the international standard for interchange message
specifications in financial transaction card originated messages.
Wong described HomeBank's security level as equivalent to that of a
physical ATM outlet.
	   ``Card reader devices are currently retailing between US$50 to
US$200 per unit,'' he said, adding that banks could encourage users
to generate electronic transactions by providing these devices.
	   The device is connected to a user's personal computer (PC) which
is online with a bank's ATM service via a modem and browser. As
with the use of an ATM, the user identifies himself or herself by
inserting or swiping either a smartcard or magnetic stripe card and
keys the personal identification number (PIN).
	   Once the PIN is authenticated, the account number is displayed
along with up-to-date account statements such as savings accounts
and quite possibly utility services such as telecommunication,
water, electricity in the browser, Wong explained.
	   This would enable users to settle monthly utility bills by
transferring funds from their current accounts to the utility
accounts.
	   ``This is a convenient and secure remote transaction in a
friendly drag- and-drop fashion,'' he said.
	   According to PDX Info-world's research and development (RD)
manager Teh Ah Hock, the development of both HomeBank and i-stock
was done in parallel. ``Both took a team of four and approximately
six months to complete,'' Teh said.
	   HomeBank's core RD was carried out at the PDX Infoworld
laboratory at Technology Park Malaysia (TPM) and at Fudan
University in China. ``On the other hand, i-stock was developed
entirely at TPM,'' Teh said.
	   The browser-base KLSE stock quote service can be viewed at
www.istock.
	   com.my and is now open for subscription at RM90 per month.
	   Wong said the company has appointed Valuenet Sdn Bhd as the
service provider to collect subscriptions.
	   Subscribers will be able to view a five-second delayed KLSE
stock quote.
	   ``The stock quote is almost real-time,'' said Teh who carried
out the testing in Malaysia and China.
	   Among its features are stock searching and sorting, creating a
personal stock portfolio and news.

World Bank loan to repair Yerevan's water and sewage system 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The World Bank is ready to give Armenia a dlrs 30
million loan to repair the water supply and sewage systems in the
capital, Yerevan, a Russian news agency said Monday.
	   Vagram Nersesyants, the bank's representative in Yerevan, said
the credit proposal was agreed to following negotiations with
Armenia's central bank. The proposal will be submitted to the World
Bank for approval June 11, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The credit, to be repaid over 35 years, must also be ratified by
the Armenian parliament.
	   The repairs are needed to prevent losses of drinking water and
to stop sewage from leaking into the water supply, ITAR-Tass said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Travelers Group Inc. said Monday it will take a
one-quarter stake in Nikko Securities Co., the third-largest
Japanese brokerage house, in one of the most aggressive moves to
date by an American financial powerhouse in Japan.
	   The New York-based company will become Nikko's biggest
shareholder, taking over from top Japanese lender Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. Nikko will buy a smaller stake in Travelers
Group to solidify the broad-based tie-up.
	   Travelers' announcement comes less than a month after it
unveiled an dlrs 82 billion merger with Citicorp to create the
world's largest financial services company.
	   ``Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more
productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world,''
said Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of
Travelers Group, speaking at a press conference in Tokyo.
	   The deal marks the latest move by a U.S. financial company to
strengthen its position in Japan in the midst of a major effort to
liberalize the Japanese financial industry by 2001. The reforms,
dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' are expected to open up a pool of personal
financial assets worth an estimated dlrs 9 trillion.
	   A number of other big names on Wall Street have also expanded in
Japan. In February, Merrill Lynch and Co. hired 2,100 former
employees of the failed Yamaichi Securities Co. to staff 33 retail
outlets nationwide. Fidelity Investments Co. has announced similar
plans.
	   As part of their strategic alliance, Travelers and Nikko plan to
link their world-wide securities sales and trading businesses. They
will also set up a jointly-owned Tokyo-based securities company
with working capital of more than 140 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion).
	   The Japanese venture, to be called Nikko Salomon Smith Barney
Ltd., will incorporate the investment banking, consumer product and
research operations of Nikko Securities, one of Japan's ``Big
Three'' brokers.
	   Masashi Kaneko, president of Nikko Securities, said that he does
not expect the tie-up will trigger a drastic reduction in the
immediate future of the number of employees or branch offices in
Japan.
	   The venture will be headed by Yuji Shirakawa, currently
president of Nikko Research Center. Toshiharu Kojima, chief
executive of Salomon Smith Barney in Japan, will become co-chief
executive of the venture, along with a Nikko Securities official.
	   Investors in Tokyo reacted positively to the news, pushing up
Nikko Securities shares 11 percent to close at 482 yen (dlrs 3.46).
	   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange launched an investigation
Monday over possible insider trading involving Nikko shares after
the price of its stock jumped Friday, an exchange official said.
	   Nikko shares closed at 436 yen (dlrs 3.16) Friday, up 4.8
percent from Thursday's close. At one point during trading Friday,
the shares rose as much as 10 percent. A total of 8.59 million
Nikko shares were traded, about 5.9 times the amount traded on
Thursday.
	   Both Travelers and Nikko denied any involvement in insider
trading, Kyodo News reported.

No reprieve for 19th SEA Games consortium over debt, JAKARTA POST

	   State Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Agung Laksono has
supported the decision made by the management of the Gelora Senayan
sports complex to refuse to waive the 19th SEA Games underwriting
consortium's Rp 1 billion (US$100,000) debt.
	   ``I can fully understand Gelora Senayan's decision. They are
directly influenced by the debts as they are the ones who have to
initially cover the expenses,'' Agung said yesterday.
	   He stressed that the consortium's amassed debts were its
responsibility and no one else's. ``I think leniency is still
likely to be given but not an exemption,'' he added.
	   The minister, however, said that the final decision would be
made at ameeting with Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung and
Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso.
	   The date of the meeting has yet to be decided but Agung pledged
to propose one immediately.
	   Agung reiterated that apart from the consortium's debt record,
it successfully carried out the onerous task assigned to it; namely
to be the first private party to stage a prestigious sporting event
like the SEA Games.
	   ``We also have to give them credit for what they achieved, the
Games was a big success,'' he said.
	   On Friday Gelora Senayan director Yasidi Hambali said that he
would refuse to waive the debt as the management had spent their
operational funds to cover the expenses like phone bills, water
charges and workers' salaries.
	   The consortium originally owed at least Rp 3.5 billion,
excluding financial losses accrued from damage caused during
violence in the soccer competition.
	   ``The debt was reduced to Rp 1 billion at the consortium's
request,'' Yasidi said.
	   The executive chairman of the consortium, Bambang Riyadi Sugama,
officially pleaded for exemption to clear the debts to Gelora
Senayan management on May 25.
	   He requested the debt clearance as compensation for the funds
used to build an artificial hockey pitch and to install a new sound
system for the complex, Yasidi said.
	   The consortium, chaired by former president Soeharto's son
Bambang Trihatmodjo, reportedly spent Rp 156.6 billion staging the
biennial sporting event, far above the estimated budget of Rp 75
billion.
	   An audited financial report made by public accountant KPMG
Hanadi Sudjendro and Co., discovered a deficit of Rp 64 billion and
also unveiled a Rp 1.8 billion scam in the sale of stickers sold to
raise funds for the Games. (emf)

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After running smoothly for months, Mir's skittish
central computer was out of order for a third day Monday,
threatening to postpone the Russian space station's last rendezvous
with a U.S. shuttle.
	   U.S. space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday
and dock with the station on Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew
Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on the Russian
outpost.
	   But that trip to the Mir is now in doubt since the shuttle can
only dock if the station's computer-controlled steering system
properly aligns it for the docking.
	   ``We hope that the crew will finally resolve the problem later
today,'' said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian Mission
Control.
	   He said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   ``They still have a lot of spares to fix the problem,'' Lyndin
told The Associated Press.
	   The ground controllers fully loaded the software into the
computer at around 6 p.m. Moscow time (1400 GMT) Monday and the
crew was expected to try restarting the computer. The station is
currently out of contact with the ground, so their success or
failure won't be known until about 7:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).

	   THE downturn in the economy should not be used as an excuse for
a dip in sales performance.
	   If companies do not take a proactive stance in selling and
maintain or increasing their market shares, they would have to bear
seeing losing their customers to competitors who are more
aggressive in their strategies.
	   In view of this, Consembition Jaya Sdn Bhd is organising a
two-day workshop titled Selling in Tough Times on July 8 and 9.
	   The workshop, to be held in Petaling Jaya, is expected to help
participants to develop the right attitude towards selling, develop
a vision for successful marketing, pick up the five strategies to
build relationships with their clients, analyse their customer base
and develop ways to get repeat sales, learn the SMART formula for
sales success, study the FAB formula for sale success and learn the
11 ways to overcome objections.
	   The workshop is targeted at managers and executives across
various industries who need to increase their sales and learn to
sell in tough times.
	   For details, call the organiser at Tel: 03-3453411/1103.

	   SEOUL --The sweeping economic restructuring taking place in
Korea resulted in new mergers and acquisitions last week.
	   A.F.S., a U.S. power company, acquired power plant operations
Friday from a unit of the Hanwha Group for 874 million dollars.
This was the largest foreign investment in Korea since its currency
plunged, forcing it to seek help from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
	   Dongham and Kyongham banks also announced recently that they are
in the final stages of merger talks while the Koran Exchange Bank
(KEB) agreed to sell its stake in Commerzbank of Germany.
	   When completed, the merger of Dongham and Kyonham will be the
first of its kind since the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
announced last month that it is encouraging non-viable banks to
merge with sound ones to avoid closures.
	   KEB's move to sell its 29.8-percent stake for 250 million
dollars to Commerzbank, the third largest bank in Germany, is an
attempt to boost its capital base, reported The Korea Times.
	   ``We agreed to sell our shares to Commerzbank to attract foreign
capital as part of our efforts to recapitalize our bank,'' Hong
Se-Pyo, president of KEB said.
	   All of these moves offer evidence of Korea's need to
recapitalize. Despite the IMF call for raising interest rates,
these measures have done little to encourage domestic savings. Bank
deposits were down 1.5-percent in the first quarter over last year.
Central bank officials link the trend to shrinking household
incomes and the continuing credit crunch in the business sector.
	   Total deposits are the sum of savings deposits, money in trust
and money market funds. To spur bank restructuring, the government
is also considering granting tax benefits to financial institutions
that take over assets and liabilities from troubled banks.
	   Much of the efforts come on the heels of Moody's Investors
Service cutting its credit ratings of five top Japanese banks last
week and putting four others on downgrade review. As a result,
Japan is now preparing the agenda for an emergency session of
parliament to work out new bank reforms to deal with outstanding
debt. Any Japanese reforms would also have a negative effect on
Korea since much of the debt is tied to Korean companies.
	   Despite the IMF call for raising interest rates, these measures
have done little to encourage domestic savings. Bank deposits were
down 1.5-percent in the first quarter over last year. Central bank
officials link the trend to shrinking household incomes and the
continuing credit crunch in the business sector.

	   LONDON (AP ) _ The European Union will hold a two-day
trade-boosting meeting with 12 Mediterranean countries in Palermo,
Italy, this week, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday.
	   Britain, which currently hold the presidency of the EU, will
chair the meeting with foreign ministers from Algeria, Cyprus,
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestinian
Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.
	   The meeting, starting Wednesday, is part of the so-called
EuroMed process started at a conference in Barcelona, Spain, in
1995 to boost political, economic and cultural links between the EU
and neighbors on the southern and eastern Mediterranean rim.
	   The aim is to establish a EuroMediterranean free trade area by
2010.

	   Imagine a scene in which two people are fighting. They are
shouting at each other, trying to be heard over each other. It is
obvious they are not listening because they are both talking at the
same time. Some bad words are spoken and the occasional tear is
spilled.
	   Does this sound like a private fight, a fight not really meant
for the public eye? Well, actually, it's just another day on the
Ricki Lake show, which is shown every Monday at 10 p.m. on ANteve.
	   On this show, people are supposed to go right ahead and spill
their guts about their spouses, parents, sons, daughters, friends
and whoever else.
	   Sony Television describes Ricki Lake as a place where ``Ricki's
trademark compassion, intellect and irresistible charm create an
atmosphere where guests and audience members feel comfortable
letting it all hang out with absolute candor and some surprising
results.'' And they can do this all on TV, in front of a live
audience and watched by millions all around the world.
	   Ricki Lake premiered five years ago in the U.S. and it has
become one of America's favorite talk shows, second only to Oprah.
The show is claimed as the fastest-growing talk show in history.
Early this year, Nielsen Media Research gave the show an average
rating of 4, which is very good, considering that talk shows
usually average 1 or 2 (except for Oprah, which averaged 6). As
comparison on the same list, X-Files scored 7.2, Xena scored 5.8,
and Hercules, the Legendary Journeys scored 4.9.
	   What is it that makes the show so interesting? Most people would
say it is the topics the show presents.
	   Ricki brings up a number of issues confronting young adults in
the 1990s which not only apply to the U.S. but to the rest of the
world as well, even Indonesia. In one of her shows, Ricki
presented: You're barely out of diapers, how can you have babies?
Even though that may sound harsh, no one can deny that the same
problem with teenage pregnancies occurs here.
	   The topics mainly relate to relationships. Ricki doesn't
constrain herself to just male/female relationships, she also
discusses relationships with parents (Mom, I can make it on my
own), with kids (I hate your interracial relationship), with
friends (Girlfriend, I slept with your man and I'll do it again),
with spouses (We've just got married and we're already in trouble),
and even bizarre relationships (Torn between two lovers), which
exposed bisexuals juggling affairs with two or three lovers of
different genders who say they can't choose who they want to be
with.
	   But not all of Ricki's topics are so earth-shaking. Some can be
harmless, like Ricki makes family dreams come true. Or end with the
guests smiling blissfully, such as in Ricki, call 911, I'll Faint
if I meet my favorite centerfold where the guests meet Playgirl
centerfolds.
	   Sometimes during the show, Ricki will invite an expert to
analyze the current situation and suggest how the people should
react to a problem or how to solve the problem without having to
resort to the seemingly ``only way out''.
	   In one show, married couples discuss their frustration with
their sex lives. The couples ranged from newlyweds to couples
married for more than 10 years. After the show, the couples spent a
night in intensive romance counseling with a therapist. They return
to the show after the therapy session and revealed how and if their
sex lives had changed.
	   Aside from the varied topics, another thing which makes the show
so exciting is that the people who come to the show come as they
are. They don't hide behind special visual effects that obscure
their faces, or special sound effects that change their voices.
	   In a similar show produced here (Buah Bibir, on RCTI) all you
see of the guest is a black silhouette (which may not even
necessarily be the person in question), talking in a voice which
has clearly been manipulated. The guests on Ricki Lake are not
ashamed to be recognized.
	   We see the face that goes with the problem, and so we can easily
accept that these people are real and that the problems they have
are equally as real. In some cases it makes it easier for us to
relate to their problems, bringing a little comfort knowing that
``we are not alone''. Knowing that we are not alone also helps us
overcome our problems which might be similar to those on the talk
show. We can also benefit from the advice given by an expert
without having to go through a therapy session and paying a lot of
money for it.
	   The fact that the people appear so candidly on Ricki Lake brings
some doubt as to whether they are ``real'' or just actors. Before
each episode is filmed, an announcer tells the studio audience
that, ``What you are about to witness is real. These people are not
actors.'' But this statement may reinforce the belief that these
shows were staged.
	   Despite this doubt, Ricki Lake is loved by millions around the
world, and that is all that matters in showbiz. If nobody watched
the show, then it would not have made it this far. Airing daily
from Monday through Friday in the U.S., it celebrated its 1,000th
episode on May 29, and there is no sign that Ricki wants to put the
mike down just yet.

Russian hard-liners to push impeachment motion backing impeachment motion, 212 signatures collected, other details. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with communist leader Zyuganov, three factions also
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian hard-liners said Monday they will try to
get an impeachment motion against President Boris Yeltsin put on
parliament's agenda during a scheduling session next week.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Yeltsin opponents will
ask members of the agenda-setting Duma Council on June 9 to
formally file the motion and set up a committee to study the
proposal. His comments were reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   The motion was also backed by the Agrarian and People's Power
factions, said Agrarian leader Nikolai Kharitonov. Together, the
three factions have 210 members in the 450-seat State Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
	   Only 150 signatures are required to put an impeachment motion on
the Duma agenda, but 300 signatures are needed to actually initiate
the proceedings.
	   Sergei Reshulsky, who is in charge of organizational issues in
the Communist faction, said 212 signatures have already been
collected, Interfax reported.
	   Impeachment proceedings are long and complex, and it would
likely take months before the motion is actually debated by the
State Duma.
	   Several previous impeachment drives have fizzled, in part
because Russia's Constitution gives the president the upper hand in
confrontations with parliament.
	   Communists and their allies launched the latest impeachment
campaign last month. They have accused Yeltsin of a range of
transgressions, including instigating the Soviet collapse,
launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the country's
economy.
	   Their frustrations intensified in April during a long test of
wills with Yeltsin, who threatened to disband the legislature
unless lawmakers approved his candidate for prime minister.

	   Amid the crisis and uncertainty, Indonesia is presenting three
feature-length films at international forums this year.
	   The Christine Hakim and Garin Nugroho production, Daun Di Atas
Bantal (A Leaf On A Pillow), was shown last week at the Cannes Film
Festival. Marselli Sumarno's Sri, the scriptwriter's directorial
debut, is now in the editing stage.
	   And Slamet Rahardjo's Telegram has been edited and the director
will take it to France for post-production, including voice mixing
and film printing.
	   Telegram is a joint production of the Indonesian film company PT
Ekapraya Tata Cipta Film and France's Artcam International. The
Indonesian side pays 70 percent of the production cost of 3 million
francs. The Indonesian National Film Assessment Board (BP2N) has
provided a loan of Rp 250 million (about US$22,000) for the film
production.
	   The cooperation provides a wider scope of international
marketing for Indonesian films.
	   Telegram is based on a Putu Wijaya novel published by Pustaka
Jaya in 1973. It won first prize as a manuscript in a competition
for novel writing organized by the Indonesian Book Year Committee
in Jakarta the previous year. It has been translated into English
and French; Putu Wijaya himself wrote the script for the film
version.
	   Slamet was assisted by director of photography Jacques Bouquin,
whose experience includes working with famous directors such as
Susan Sontag and Jean-Luc Godard. The soundman and the editor are
also French: Bernard Aubouy and Catherine D'hoir. The Indonesian
crew also included Judy Subroto, the artistic director.
	   Sujiwo Tejo, a journalist and wayang puppeteer, plays Daku, the
protagonist. Popular actresses Ayu Azhari and Desi Ratnasari also
appear.
	   Telegram tells the story of a Balinese journalist who works in
Jakarta. Telegrams have a special meaning for him; his relatives
back home always send bad news via them. He always feels terror
every time he receives a telegram from his family.
	   A telegram means that he must return to the village to face
life's realities as a young man who is the hope of his parents. He
must be responsible for all matters of disharmony in the family and
all the requirements of custom which he is not ready to bear.
	   This unnerving condition is harder to deal with as he
experiences a lot of conflicts. Professionally, he may object to
particular things, but conditions require him to make compromises
bearing in mind his responsibility as a journalist in a developing
country.
	   Conflicts about the ways to overcome the problems are the
essential problems in this story. As an individual who wants to be
free, he clashes with the bonds of family and custom. As a
journalist he knows many things but he must show restraint in
expressing them.
	   In facing the realities, he sometimes gets away from them. He is
trapped in his imagination if he wants to be honest about all
fears, worries and doubts. Beautiful Rosa, played by Ayu, is always
present as an ideal woman in his imagination. She is a friend and a
foe in the process of finding his own identity.
	   Sujiwo Tejo makes his acting debut in the film, but he does his
utmost to perform up to par with the rest of the cast. His exotic
face and appearance contributed a lot to his performance.
	   Telegram is Slamet Rahardjo's first feature film since the 1991
production of Langitku Rumahku (My Sky My Home) which was
successful at international fora. It won the Unesco prize for best
film on children at the Berlin Film Festival, the Jacques Demy cup
at the Nantes Film Festival in France, awards at the Hawaii and
Sydney film festivals and recognition from Japan and Cairo, Egypt.
	   It was a flop in the domestic market. The 21 Group of movie
theaters showed his film for one day only. The 21 Group is owned by
the Subentra Group, which controls the distribution of imported
films here. The 21 Group said they withdrew the film for purely
business reasons because it did not sell tickets, but Slamet
believed they did not show it due to what he and many others
consider the monopolistic practices of the company.
	   Slamet sued PT Perfin, the company in charge of managing the
domestic circulation of films, for its failure to support the
development of local films. He lost in court.
	   It is hoped Telegram will be proof of Slamet Rahardjo's
achievements after an absence of eight years when he was mostly
involved in the making of short films or TV movies.
	   The writer is involved in filmmaking and is a lecturer at the
School of Films and Television, Jakarta Arts Institute.

	   The Indonesian Navy ship KRI Tanjung Oisina repatriated 1,725
illegal workers and their children on May 5 from Johor, Malaysia.
The operation was part of a mass deportation supported by the
Indonesian government and aimed at reducing the number of illegal
workers in Malaysia, estimated to be 200,000 of the one million
Indonesian workers there. The Jakarta Post photographer IGN Oka
Budhi Yogaswara, who joined the operation, compiled the following
report and pictures.
	   ABOARD TANJUNG OISINA (JP): They had worked as housemaids,
construction workers and plantation laborers. Many had tried to
look for better work but failed to tell authorities when they found
new employment. They ended up in camps for illegal workers who
could not produce the appropriate documents and, eventually, from
among the thousands of detainees, some were sent home.
	   The 1,580 men, 136 women and nine infants who departed on May 5
were from the detention camps of Pekan Nanas in Johor, Lenggeng in
Seremban, Juru in Penang, Langkap in Perak and Machap Umbo in
Malacca.
	   At the docks in Pasir Gudang, Johor, some of the group were
decked out in fine clothes while others wore torn, filthy garments.
Some were too smelly to even get near. They told of good treatment
at the camps.
	   But, once on board and away from the rather tense atmosphere at
the docks, their tales completely changed with various versions of
violence and sexual abuse. They were too afraid to file reports as
some fellow detainees had died from the beatings.
	   Faces reflected relief and many pledged they would never go
back. But others said they would try anything to get another job in
Malaysia, where pay for manual labor was much higher than in
Indonesia.
	   ``Malaysians do not want to do crude work,'' one of them said.
	   Despite the risks, they said they would still ignore procedures
and use brokers as the legal means were ``too complicated and
lengthy''.
	   Tanjung Oisina left Tanjung Priok Port in North Jakarta on May
1. After arriving in Johor on May 5, it only took a couple of hours
for the workers to board and be check before the ship departed for
Tanjung Perak Port in Surabaya, East Java, where about 1,108 men
and women disembarked on May 10. The ship docked at Lembar Port in
Lombok two days later to drop off 617 passengers and arrived in
Jakarta on May 17.
	   Eight hundred and fifty-nine workers were from East Java, 599
from East Nusa Tenggara and the remainder were from other areas in
Java, West Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Jakarta.
	   The captain and chief of the 60-strong joint task force in
charge of the operation was Commander Suryono. The team comprised
members of the marines, Military Sea Traffic Authority, Navy
Frogmen, immigration and Ministry of Manpower officials, and other
government and military elements. (oby)

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Police detained a man when things got out
of hand after DAP supporters were barred from organising a
gathering to show support for Kota Melaka Member of Parliament Lim
Guan Eng, today.
	   The man, whose identity is being withheld, was detained for
allegedly using derogatory words against and pushing Dang Wangi
police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner (II) Zainal Abidin Ali.
	   The man is believed to have acted in that way after police took
away a loudhailer from DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang when he
tried to use it to speak to about 150 people who had turned up for
the ``Gathering of Legal Eagles'' at the Federal Hotel.
	   Zainal Abidin had earlier asked Kit Siang to ask those gathered
outside the function room to disperse as they had not heeded
repeated police appeals to do so.
	   When Kit Siang spoke to the crowd using the loudhailer, it burst
out into applause and shouts of support for DAP.
	   About 30 policemen, led by Zainal Abidin, had arrived at the
hotel about 9.30am to disperse the crowd as the gathering was
considered illegal.
	   Speaking to reporters at the scene, Zainal Abidin said police
were forced to disperse the gathering as the organisers did not
possess or apply for a permit to hold such a function.
	   Guan Eng, 37, son of Opposition leader Kit Siang, is facing an
18-month imprisonment for two counts of publishing false news.
	   He has since filed an appeal against the sentence imposed by the
Court of Appeal on April 1.
	   Speaking to reporters after the gathering was dispersed at
10.35am today, Kit Siang called the incident a ``black day for
democracy in Malaysia'' and ``a day of shame for the police''.
	   ``We have held about 40 such gatherings in the country as a show
of support for Guan Eng.
	   ``For the gatherings before this, we did not have to apply for a
permit.
	   ``If the police want to change everything and say we have to
apply for a permit, they should have at least given us ample
notice,'' Kit Siang said.
	   He added the DAP would now apply for a permit to hold the
gathering at a later date.

Portuguese court convicts four Britons of drug smuggling 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PORTIMAO, Portugal (AP) - A court Monday sentenced four British
men to six years in prison for smuggling hashish.
	   The five, all residents of Gibraltar, were convicted of bringing
two packages containing 54 kilograms (119 pounds) of hashish into
southern Portugal by boat.
	   The British embassy in Lisbon identified the men as Nicholas
Gill, Darrel Kerry, Alan Lopez and Karon Yusifredo.
	   The men were arrested last year in Portimao, 300 kilometers (186
miles) south of Lisbon, where they arrived by private yacht.
	   They offloaded the hashish and were burying it on a beach when
the police pounced.
	   Two other men charged, Britons John Barnham and Anthony Godding,
were acquitted.

	   Despite years of health warnings, smoking is still socially
acceptable in Indonesia.
	   Activists have launched antismoking campaigns, yet many people
ignore the warnings.
	   Emma Surachman, a member of the National Forum for Antismoking
Campaigns, said the fight against smoking has been very tough in
the last few years. But ``antismoking campaigners are toothless
when facing the influential cigarette industry which has strong
access and lots of money for promotional campaigns.''
	   Emma said it was usually non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
which were behind antismoking campaigns and these organizations did
not have then power to impose the measures needed to prevent the
cigarette industry from hiding the hazardous effects of smoking
from the public.
	   The forum, comprising eight organizations including the
Indonesian Cancer Society, the Asthma Foundation, the Heart Society
and Women against Tobacco, actively holds antismoking seminars,
workshops and other activities at schools, private companies and
government offices.
	   The banning of smoking in some public areas is one important
result of the campaigns, she said.
	   ``There is a lot more to be done and we hope the government
fully supports our activities for the sake of people's health,''
Emma said.
	   The forum has recommended that steps be taken to safeguard the
right of nonsmokers to live in an environment free of contamination
from tobacco smoke.
	   It has also suggested that smoking should be banned in all
public places, measures should be taken to avoid the portrayal of
cigarettes as being trendy in advertisements targeted at
youngsters.
	   ``Media advertising is a potential way for cigarette companies
to keep their products fresh in the minds of consumers,'' Emma
said.
	   Electronic and printed media also play significant roles in
promoting cigarettes.
	   Tulus Abadi, a consumer activist, lashed out at TV commercials
that portray smokers as successful and attractive.
	   ``Such a portrayal may encourage people, especially teenagers,
to smoke,'' he said.
	   Regardless of these harmful influences, local television and
radio stations continue to air cigarette commercials. They also
ignore a l990s Ministry of Information decree which bans all forms
of cigarette commercials on TV and radio. Many newspapers, tabloids
and magazines also reap profits from running cigarette ads.
	   But some media have banned cigarette advertising. One such
company is the country's largest newspaper, Kompas, which along
with film actor Roy Marten received this year's No Tobacco Award
from WHO for their commitment to antismoking campaigning.
	   Julius Pour, Kompas' public relations executive, said the daily
realized that accepting cigarette ads would be very profitable.
	   ``But it is not a matter of money. By banning cigarette
advertising, we want to set an example that we are an institution
that promotes healthy living among our readers and society in
general,'' he said.
	   Philanthropic
	   In addition to media advertising, cigarette companies have
successfully shaped an image of being ``philanthropic''
institutions which pour money into a vast array of public
activities from sports to more sophisticated cultural events.
	   Retno Widiastuti, an executive of the Indonesian Consumers
Foundation, said that such sponsorships must be interpreted as a
company's attempt to gain social acceptance.
	   ``There are many sports events including tennis and badminton
championships backed by cigarette companies,'' she said. In sports,
athletes should maintain their condition by avoiding harmful habits
like smoking. ``But in reality, sports events still rely heavily on
the cigarette industry for financial backing. It is so ironic,''
added Retno.
	   Besides sports events, the cigarette industry also finances many
entertainment and cultural programs.
	   A Mild Jakarta Jazz Festival, for instance, enjoys secure
financial support from one of Indonesia's biggest cigarette
companies, which gains promotional benefit from the title of the
festival. In other entertainment events, free cigarettes are given
to the visitors.
	   The cigarette industry also wants to play a greater role in
nurturing art activities. For example, an American tobacco giant
has actively sponsored local fine art contests and exhibitions over
the last few years.
	   The cigarette industry is a forceful power which welds influence
over society and over the government as well.
	   International events are also dominated by tobacco sponsorship.
Despite a proposed ban on tobacco sponsorships, health ministries
of the European Union reportedly allows one of the world's biggest
tobacco companies to continue sponsoring Formula One racing out of
fear that the organizer will relocate this prestigious sports event
to a more smoke-friendly country in Asia or Africa.
	   ``It is very difficult to reduce reliance on cigarette
sponsorship unless event organizers find alternative financial
backers, which are now almost impossible because of the economic
crisis,'' said Retno.

	   SRI Medan State Assemblywoman Puan Sri Atkah Abdullah says the
Education Ministry should do more to provide schools with
computers.
	   ``Sometimes when I attend Parent-Teacher Association meetings,
the schools request for computers.
	   ``As a State Assemblywoman, my financial allowances are limited.
I can only give one computer to selected schools,'' said Atkah, who
is also an executive council member of Wanita Umno.
	   She, however, said that one computer per school was not
sufficient.
	   Atkah said she was grateful to the relevant government agencies
which have helped her look into and address the grievances of her
constituents.
	   ``I am very grateful to these agencies. Without them, it would
not have been possible for me to solve the problems of my
constituents,'' said the bespectacled wakil rakyat.
	   The Sri Medan constituency covers areas bordering Pekan Yong
Peng to Chaaah towards Labis and Parit Mustafa at the west coast.
	   She said the perennial problem faced by her constituents were
floods as the area was low lying.
	   A former teacher who retired as a district education supervisor
in 1989, Atkah can now confidently claim that most areas were now
free of floods.
	   ``Under the Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor and Johor Barat
projects, the flood problem has been overcome,'' she said, adding
that both projects were initiated by the State Government.
	   She said now the people want tarred roads in the villages. There
were still some untarred stretches in the hinterland.
	   ``We hope to do that soon,'' she said, adding that these
villages had other basic amenities such as water and electricity
supply.
	   Atkah said as the majority of her constituents were farmers and
smallholders, she, with the assistance of the relevant government
agencies, encouraged womenfolk to actively participate in cottage
industries to help supplement their income.
	   ``This is the best way to increase their income given the
present circumstances. They can produce temperek, keropok pisang,
tapioca fries and much more.
	   ``Their products can also be easily transported for sale
elsewhere as there is an excellent road network linking Sri Medan
to other major towns,'' said Atkah.
	   Atkah said although Sri Medan was not as developed compared to
its neighbours, the constituency has sufficent schools and health
facilities.
	   ``We will be building a new market and a multi-purpose hall in
Parit Sulong. We have received allocations both from the Federal
and State authorities and hope that work can commence soon,'' she
said.
	   Constituents who wish to meet her can call her at her home in
Batu Pahat.

	   Bowo must be brilliant. Yes, he is. Just two days prior to his
graduation from Narish Banking Academy and a foreign bank offered
him an apprenticeship in management.
	   Damn, didn't we all dream of that happening to ourselves? Of
course, it is all due to his buddy; the guy's father is the
director of human resources. Hey, Bowo, tell your friend to tell
all his friends, and they should tell all their friends. Prita was
so excited.
	   Prita and Bowo then pledged that they would get married within
two years. Hey, they usually put the guy first ... And you people,
get your handkerchiefs ready. To be exact, it would fall exactly
when Bowo finished his apprenticeship at the Bank of Ougabouga.
	   Both of their parents agreed that their children would cement
their four-year relationship with a marriage in two years. Really?
Some Romeos can date more than 48 women in that time, you know.
	   ``You'll both wear engagement rings next year. But for now,
Prita will continue with her studies, and you'll continue with your
promising job.'' Prita's father said to the two lovers. Dear
ol'Daddy Cool.
	   Lovers? Yes. It was not uncommon for them to watch movies
together. The hell with the movies, they were playing with their
noses. Dinner by candlelight in a restaurant? Yes, but not that
often. Most of the time they helped each other in finishing a big
tin of cookies together, lip to lip. ``Ouch!'' How dare they do
that to that poor cookie tin. No wonder they threw the tin away.
Sweet Jesus! Poor tin, why were you there when they were alone
together? If only you had the power of Rambo.
	   Hey, you're mean not to warn them of the consequences. Shame on
you!
	   ``What are we going to do Bowo? I can feel it kicking.''
	   Bowo looked up at the gigantic chandelier. It was worth looking
at. It floated like an upside-down mushroom, and it shone brightly,
making the night envious. No, don't worry night sky, the chandelier
is afraid of you. See, it hides in the dome shape of that Gatsby
restaurant. See?
	   ``Oh God, I think its time for us to see Dr. Syamsul.''
	   God, can you believe it? He said God!
	   Oh look! I think the fairy agrees. Prita looked at him. She said
something, hold on, hold on, she said something.
	   ``Well, we have no other choice.''
	   Hey, she stared deep into the window. Damn right you have no
choice! What are you thinking about, Mama? Don't look so gloomy,
woman. You've got someone gorgeous there to take care of you. So
don't look so sad.
	   ``If anybody we know finds out, it'd be catastrophic.''
	   You bitch! A human being is about to begin its journey here. You
say it's catastrophic. Hey, where do you both think you're going?
To Dr. Syamsul's place? He lives in Tebet, but it's too late for
his counseling. Leave everything behind and let's follow these two
sorry people.
	   Dr. Syamsul's clinic is located deep inside the alleyways. Bowo
and Prita's car moves along and soon reaches the alley that leads
to the clinic. Damn, it really looks like those alleys are
especially made for snakes, curves and curves.
	   ``Well, we're here darling,'' said Bowo.
	   The sign on the board states that Dr. Syamsul's hours end at 6
p.m.. Man, I think it's too late for them to deliver the baby. Bowo
looked around to make sure that not even the soul of a lizard was
around, and knocked lightly on Dr. Syamsul's door.
	   ``Well, well, my dear Bowo, how are you?'' Dr. Syamsul asks
after recognizing the two lovers, one with a big tummy.
	   ``Fine, doctor. I need you to check on Prita's condition. If
possible, we'll deliver this baby tonight, Doc.''
	   Dr. Syamsul whispers ``Alright, come right in.''
	   People, I think you can now use your handkerchiefs. Prita, Oh
Prita. You people should have seen how she struggled between life
and death. Oh, she sighed so massively that it forced her eyes
closed. It must have felt like rusted daggers were hacking through
her limbs. Dr. Syamsul, why did you keep on pushing her? Didn't you
hear her screaming the song of the wounded, and see her perspiring,
like a dying wolf at night? Bowo, what is the matter with you?
Don't malfunction like a robot. Tell the doctor to take it easy
with your precious there. Oh, finally, the squeal of a soft cry.
	   ``Congratulations, it's a girl. Strong and healthy.''
	   ``Well, you know what to do, Doc. Besides, I just wrote you a
seven-digit check. You can cash it at the Bank of Ougabouga.''
	   The doctor wrapped the newborn in white cloth as though she was
a delicate birthday present. But suddenly, a knock on the door
struck all present like a bolt out of the blue, including the
frail, lovely Prita.
	   ``Damn!'' muttered Bowo as he heard the knock. ``Who could that
be?''
	   ``I don't know, but from the window it looks like the RT. Here,
you and Prita can hide in my bedroom. You take the baby first till
I get rid of whoever it is.'' The doctor locked the bedroom door.
	   ``Good evening Mr. RT, what can I do for you?''
	   ``Some neighbors told me that they heard a woman screaming in
your clinic, so I thought I'd just check it out.''
	   The doctor raised his eyebrows and opened his mouth.
	   ``Scream? Woman? Good gracious. Oh, they must have mistaken the
sound of my new electric drill. I was just testing it.''
	   The RT look taken aback.
	   ``What are you doing with an electric drill in the clinic, Dr.
Syamsul?''
	   ``Well... well, I just use it for placing some wall hangings. I
apologize for the noise. You know how it is, I don't have any free
time during the day.''
	   At that moment, Bowo opened the door slightly and peeked out.
Even though the slight sound of the door opening would not be
noticed by the RT or the doctor, it was sensed by the young child,
who let out a cry.
	   ``What's that noise?'' The RT sounded alarmed.
	   Bowo felt thousands of ice daggers pierce his heart and he
rushed to the window with the baby.
	   ``People are still roaming around,'' thought Bowo.
	   ``I think I saw a man jumping out of the clinic's window, Bu,''
said one among the crowd.
	   ``Ah, Ibu, don't be nasty,'' her friend said.
	   ``Thank God,'' thought Bowo.
	   Hey, hey, that's a garbage dumpster, Bowo. What are you doing?
What! Hey! No! What in the name of God are you doing? Look! Look at
the baby, what kind of sin did this little one commit to deserve
sleeping on a bed of garbage? How could you do this? What kind of a
father are you? You moron!
	   ``What noise?'' Asked Dr. Syamsul in a mixture of irritation and
bewilderment.
	   The RT moved his head around like an antennae.
	   ``Well, I must be going now, Doctor. Sorry to bother you.'' And
he disappeared quietly into the night.
	   ``Where's the damn child?'' asked the doctor.
	   ``I've thrown it away in the garbage.''
	   ``Oh, thanks. But you and your Prita must get the hell out of
here. I've had enough trouble. Prita is still weak, but she'll
manage it. Now, out! But don't forget my check.''
	   Finally they were in their car and cruising down the road. The
couple felt a sudden relief.
	   ``Where are we going now?'' asked Prita.
	   ``Well, since you are still weak, dropping you at your house
means questions. So, I guess we'll visit my newlywed cousins on Jl.
Radio Dalam, you can stay there till morning. They can be trusted.
But we don't have to tell them what we've been through. We'll make
a call to your parents, telling them we just arrived and are
exhausted from a friend's party.''
	   ``What about you, Bowo?''
	   ``I'll go straight home. You know my parents don't like the idea
of me staying overnight.''
	   ``Hello, Prita, Bowo, come in, come in. Mas, we have guests from
far away.''
	   ``Thank you, Mbak Renni.''
	   ``Oh Prita, you seem to have lost weight. Have you been sick?''
	   ``Yes, Mbak Renni, I've just recuperated from fever. Nothing
serious though.''
	   As soon as they all reached the living room, Bowo and Prita told
them of the party at a friend's house and their intention of
dropping by. Bowo asked permission to use the phone and told
Prita's parents their made up story.
	   ``We've also just arrived from shopping.'' said Mbak Renni's
husband.
	   ``And, guess what? We have a surprise we'd like you to see. Hold
on.''
	   Renni got up and went to her bedroom. She brought a bundle back
into the room with her. A miniature hand with a miniature glove
peeked out of the bundle.
	   ``Oh, Mbak Renni, it's cute. But I didn't know you just had your
first child,'' said Bowo. ``Isn't it cute, Prita.''
	   ``Yes, you should still be in the hospital, you're too weak, you
know.'' Prita continued.
	   ``Oh, who said I gave birth to this baby? God gave it to us
through a young street singer in Tebet.''
	   A dark, silent cloud covered Bowo and Prita. Even fingernails on
a blackboard would be music to them.
	   ``What?'' They both asked in unison.
	   ``We were checking out this new mall down in Tebet, and as we
were about to go home, two street singers approached us in the
parking lot. They said they wanted to sell the baby. They said they
needed money. I asked where the baby's parents were, and they said
they had no idea because they found it in a garbage dumpster. I
cursed the parents who threw or almost killed their own baby. So,
Mas Ato gave them Rp 50,000, at which they were overjoyed. And so
was I.''
	   As she was talking, the two lovers felt the dark cloud hanging
over them blacken further. And Renni held the baby toward Prita,
who took her gently.
	   ``Oh look, it's as though the baby knows you, Prita. Look how
cute this baby is. I'm going to name it Sinta. Look Sinta, Sinta,
this is Aunt Prita. Oh... you seem to be comfortable with Aunt
Prita.''
	   Long live poor cookie tin! Un! Dos! Tres! Ole! Ole! Ole!
...Rujak Ulek. Rujake wong lagi judek ...I'm a Barbie girl, in a
Barbie world...

	   SEMERAH State Assemblyman Tan Teck Poh is in a dilemma.
	   The MCA Parit Sulong division head is aware that there is an
acute shortage of houses in his constituency, but yet he cannot
seem to find a solution to address the matter.
	   ``Now, with more people coming to work in Batu Pahat and Parit
Sulong, the demand for houses has far exceeded supply,'' said the
Parit Sulong-born businessman.
	   The Semerah State Assembly covers half of Batu Pahat town in the
south and borders Muar in the north.
	   Tan says that a sizeable portion of his constituency consisted
of Malay Reserve Land and as such it was difficult to find suitable
land for housing projects, be it medium- or low-cost.
	   Citing an example, he says the entire stretch of Jalan Muar is
Malay Reserve Land and apart from the traditional villages, there
are not many suitable areas for housing.
	   ``I have brought up the matter at the Johor State Assembly
meeting and I hope the State Government will come up with a
solution,'' he said.
	   Tan said previously his priority was to solve the flooding
problem.
	   ``Previously, each time it rained, several low-lying areas in
the town centre such as Jalan Sultanah, Jalan Rogayah, Jalan Mohd
Salleh, Jalan Mohd Akhir and Jalan Parit Dobi would be flooded,''
he said.
	   He said that a RM40 million grant from the State Government for
flood mitigation programmes had now helped solve the problem.
	   An underground monsoon drain has been constructed below Jalan
Sultanah while monsoon drains along Jalan Bakau Condong and Jalan
Parit Dobi have been widened and deepened.
	   Tan said Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman had also
taken a personal interest to ensure all villages had tarred roads
and other basic infrastructure facilities.
	   ``Now, about 80 per cent of the 60 parit (villages) in my
constituency have tarred roads. We are confident that within the
next two years, all villages will have tarred roads,'' he said.
	   Tan said there was also a need to bring in industries to Semerah
to create more jobs for the constituents.
	   ``There are ample jobs but most of them are in industrial areas
surrounding Semerah.
	   ``Many youths who are fed up of travelling, have migrated to
bigger towns and some have even gone to Singapore to work,'' he
said.
	   Tan said as most of his constituents were farmers or
smallholders, they were encouraged to supplement their income by
doing other activities such as aquaculture or cottage-based
industries.
	   Citing examples, he said those living in Mukim Lubok Darat were
encouraged to rear honeybees while those in Mukim Sungai Nibong
Darat were encouraged to go into fish rearing.
	   Asked on the recent controversy surrounding the renovation work
on a Buddhist temple in Muslim-majority Kampung Bintang, Tan said
he had directed the contractors to stop work.
	   ``I do not want any party to get offended,'' he said.
	   The temple is popular with followers as far as Singapore who
come here during the weekends to offer prayers.
	   Tan said the latest additions to Semerah was a RM800,000
multi-purpose hall and a RM570,000 market.
	   Tan said constituents who had any complaints could meet him at
his service centre in Jalan Jenang or his business office in Jalan
Temenggong.

	   Redefining the meaning of a religion is needed to prevent
understanding a religion from deteriorating into a religious cult
and fundamentalism, expressed as fanaticism in the way a religion
is professed.
	   When a community professing a certain religion mentions
religion, what is actually meant is religion at the syari'ah
(normative) level.
	   Social scientists studying religious affairs define religion as
an empiric historical and sociological fact. This is because
different patterns of religious behavior stem from the different
patterns of understanding of the holy books brought about by
different holy books and prophets (Nabi in Arabic, meaning
messenger).
	   It is this pattern of religious behavior that is sociologically
called a religious institution, which is also the most concrete
form of being religious.
	   It is often the case that the followers of a particular religion
consider understanding their religious teaching as an absolute and
superior truth.
	   This, in essence, is an act of giving prominence to the
superiority of the value system regarding the textual authenticity
of the holy book of a particular religion.
	   This implies that the value system of other religions is often
considered illicita (false) and even heretical; their origins in
divine decrees are denied by followers of other faiths.
	   To avoid such a claim of truth by different groups of religious
followers, it is necessary to hold a constructive dialogs by
performing a religious and intellectual pilgrimage (''crossing
over'') to broaden one's horizon of understanding and enable one to
understand the universal message contained in a divine decree.
	   The religious and intellectual pilgrimage to cross over to
another religion must be coupled with an attitude of returning to
one's own religion.
	   Conversion
	   So, the spirit of passing over must make one cling firmly and be
committed to the teaching of one's own religion, so that one is
convinced of the correctness of one's own religion without claiming
that other religions are heretical.
	   One should admit that other religions also provide a guarantee
of salvation, a view which would not contradict with divine decrees
passed down through His messenger.
	   This method is developed by experts in interreligious dialogs
and is known as ``intellectual conversion'', namely, allowing
oneself to be converted to another religion at the level of ideas,
not at the essential level of faith. Peter Berger, a contemporary
American sociologist, called it methodological atheism.
	   A religious and intellectual pilgrimage must be conducted to
avoid religious exclusiveness. From this, one moves toward
religious inclusiveness and finally arrives at religious pluralism,
which must be understood and accepted as a certainty.
	   It is at this point that we may know why God has created
pluralistic, not monolithic, mankind. It is also at this point that
we may find out why God has created different syir'ah (ways) for
each group of followers of a particular religion to arrive at
kalimatun sawa' (a meeting point) with the same objective.
	   In this book, an anthology, all the writers, many of them famous
names here, emphasize that one should not fall into the trap of
``rigid'' religious formalism as usually understood by religious
followers, be they Moslems, Jewish, Christians and so forth.
	   Rigid understanding is born out of an inability to get the
universal ``message'' of a divine decree. A case in point is the
rigid understanding in the Christian tradition prior to the Holy
See Council II, known as the doctrine of extra ecclesius nulla
salus (beyond the Church there is no salvation).
	   Unfortunately, slogans in the same vein as the above doctrine
are also found in other religions today.
	   Although the writers here view the subject matter from different
angles, none indicate a conflict between religions.
	   Instead, the writings show optimism that in the future,
different religions will exist side by side in a global village.
Followers will not only be actively involved in acknowledging the
existence of other religious but also help other religions to
exist.
	   The book is divided into four sections, each of which consists
of three detailed chapters.
	   The first part is about religious dialogs -- their context,
problems of religious dialogs and the perspective of religious
dialogs.
	   Nurcholish Madjid begins with al-Islam as a universalism.
Al-Islam, generically meaning the teaching of ``total submission to
the will of God'' as taught by all prophets, is, to borrow a term
from the Koran, called al-hanafiyyat al-samhah, namely the spirit
of seeking broad and open truth.
	   This is what is called professing a religion in the real sense
of the word, namely, religion being accepted beside God, who
teaches the spirit of Islam.
	   Therefore, Prophet Abraham is called someone who is hanif, one
who sincerely and purely seeks truth, without any bond to organized
religion, namely religion as an empiric historical ad sociological
fact, which is, therefore, normative.
	   From a different viewpoint, using a new approach of missionary
theology, Barbara Brown discusses dialogs as a contemporary issue,
particularly as regards the relationship between Islam and
Christianity.
	   Komaruddin Hidayat, another contributor, is keen on theology
dialog, which is often forgotten, so that there is a paradigm
shift, a topic that Abdurrahman Wahid discusses.
	   Abdurrahman dwells on the causes of a paradigm shift, which has
brought about religious shallowness and brings up examples from
across the country.
	   Still in the first section, dialogs have become problems as yet
to solve among internal quarters called ukhuwah islamiyyah in many
different versions.
	   Mohamad Sobary writes about this matter and uses the term
``sociological imagination'' instead of normative imagination. The
section is closed with an essay by Wahyuni Nafis, who approaches
dialogs from the historical angle.
	   Problems of religious freedom, world religions and
interreligious relationships and religious figures are
systematically arranged in good order in the book.
	   The different views of the contributing writers gradually take
us to the essence of the matter; the necessity of religious and
intellectual pilgrimage needed to cast away religious
exclusiveness.
	   -- Chusnul Murtafiin
	   The writer is a student of religious comparative studies at the
state-run college of Islamic studies, IAIN Sunan Kalijaga in
Yogyakarta.

	   COMMUNITY Aids Service Penang is saddened by the arrest of 37
transvestites in Alor Star on May 17 and their subsequent
conviction.
	   It is unfortunate that our lawmakers and enforcers are guided by
a common, but outdated, completely erroneous and unscientific view
of human physical and psychological development.
	   In our work in the community on AIDS prevention, CASP has
developed close contact with the transgender community as one of
the groups of people who are vulnerable to the transmission of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS.
	   Syariah Court judge Sheikh Zainol Embon is quoted as saying:
``The court is very disappointed and hurt with what you did.
	   ``It looks as though you cannot accept the fact that you are men
and want to change the fact by becoming women.
	   ``Acts of men dressing or acting like women and vice versa are
loathed by religion and deserve severe punishment.'' (NST, May 24).
	   Modern scientific understanding is that there is a full
gradation between male and female and not a clear dividing line, no
black and white, but only shades of gray.
	   It is our incapability to accept them as they are that is the
problem.
	   By not accepting the transgendered as created by God, we push
them into the margins of society where using drugs and finding sex
are the only way to make a living.
	   It is unfortunate that religion is so often used to create
outcasts in society rather than bring universal love and acceptance
to all of God's creation.
	   It is time for Malaysians to discuss more openly our prejudices
towards the transgendered and other sexual minorities and strive
towards creating a really caring society.
	   We need to have better scientific and psychosocial knowledge in
this area so we can help and counsel this group more effectively
and develop a truly caring society.

Thousand celebrate reform at Depok campus, JAKARTA POST

	   Under the sullen glow of moonlight and bamboo flares, some
10,000 people descended on the University of Indonesia campus in
Depok Friday night, listening to music and casually exchanging
views on the mood of reform gripping the country.
	   The spirit of reform was clearly in the air, but in contrast to
often boisterous, albeit peaceful, protests held by students, a
festive flavor imbued the gathering which brought students,
activists, government critics and musicians together with residents
of Depok who had swarmed to an open field to enjoy the free
entertainment.
	   Such was the jovial mood of the proceedings that the planned
discussions on reform were quickly overtaken by musical
performances.
	   On the hilly ground surrounding the field, many sat in groups,
chatting and jesting with each other.
	   The students, from various universities as evident in the
various colors of school jackets, outnumbered the nonstudents by
two to one.
	   The semblance of the reform movement was evident in the monolog
discussions and vendors inviting people to show they were in the
spirit of reform by buying headbands inscribed with ``Peaceful
Reform''.
	   The event had been planned as a 12-hour gathering of music and
discussions on reform.
	   It started at about 5 p.m. with four continuous discussions on
reform covering the economic, cultural, political and legal
aspects.
	   Experts who got to speak were economist Sri Mulyani, political
observer Arbi Sanit, constitutional law expert Satya Arinanto and
sociologist Selo Soemardjan. Each appeared in a ``talk show''
moderated by comedians Dono and Indro along with television
presenter Ira Koesno.
	   Former legislator Sri Bintang Pamungkas, who, as a political
prisoner, was released from jail on Tuesday, was seen mixing with
the crowd.
	   ``I just came here to enjoy tonight's performances,'' Bintang
said.
	   Legal expert Todung Mulya Lubis, decked out in a suit and tie,
was also happily chatting away.
	   He had originally been scheduled as one of the speakers, but he
cheerfully ceded his time as spectators began shouting
``Iwan...Iwan,'' insisting that popular folk singer Iwan Fals step
on stage.
	   Other musicians who performed Friday night were Franky
Sahilatua, Harry Roesli, Djaduk Ferianto, Oppie Andaresta and rock
group Slank. Poets Putu Widjaja and WS Rendra also contributed with
a few lines of prose.
	   Happy
	   While not everyone was happy that the ``talk shows'' were cut
short, there was generally a sense of satisfaction that many could
exchange views about the future of the reform movement and trade
stories on the success of the student demonstrations in helping
topple a 32-presidential reign.
	   ``I wanted to hear more from the talk show. But the public, not
the students, demanded Iwan,'' a disgruntled a student from
Universitas Perintis Nasional (UPN), Anto, told The Jakarta Post at
about midnight.
	   Arianto, the chairman of UI's Alumni Association of the School
of Social and Political Sciences, admitted that many things did not
go according to the program.
	   But Arianto, who helped organize the event, did not seem too
displeased.
	   Sadono, an alumnus from the Surabaya Institute of Technology,
said he had accompanied students who wanted to meet their
colleagues and share their views about reform.
	   ``We had an informal discussion with alumni from UI and the
Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) on the current political and
economic situation. We agreed that total reform means a reform in
the system and we will make a concept on how such reforms can be
accomplished,'' he said.
	   When asked about the night's gathering, Sadono simply said ``I
am happy to be here'', while adding that it allowed people to talk
freely within the confines of a formal discussion.
	   Ari, a final year junior high school student from nearby Bojong
Gede, said he was there to experience the elation of the student
reform movement.
	   ``I wish to see an improvement in my family's economic life,''
said Ari when asked what he hoped he would get out of the reform
movement. Ari was also there to kill time while waiting for his
graduation announcement at his school the next morning.
	   Despite being planned to go on till 5 a.m. yesterday, droves
were already making the long walk to the campus gates at about
midnight.

	   Bloodied hands need to be washed. Particularly if they can give
some relief to upset stomachs.
	   These could be thoughts running through the minds of a handful
of hard-eyed males, from teenage boys and to middle-aged men, on
Jl. Kembang Sepatu, Kramat Raya, Central Jakarta, who spared no
effort to sell off what apparently seemed to be looted goods.
	   With small stalls selling spare parts, aluminum and steel,
electronic goods, refrigerators and wooden carvings lining both
sides of the road, a walk down Jl. Kembang Sepatu might give the
impression that it was business as usual last week.
	   This was unless one alighted from a bus or taxi at the bus stop
at the end of the road.
	   A few men waited by cabs till passengers paid their cab fares.
Some even went to the extent of knocking at cab windows,
non-verbally pressing the passenger to get out quickly and see what
they had in their hands.
	   An assortment of American diamond-studded quartz watches, sold
for between Rp 250,000 (US$23.80) and Rp 400,000 in shops, were
offered for Rp 60,000 by these men.
	   Some came up with cellular phones.
	   ``I will give it to you for Rp 95,000,'' said a teenager.
``Where can you get this price? It's actually worth more than Rp
1.3 million elsewhere.''
	   Amidin (not his real name) was selling tires from drink or
food-vending trolleys, with the steel parts surrounded by
still-blackened rubber, for Rp 15,000, while the market-price is Rp
60,000. He also sold motorbike tires at Rp 25,000 when the market
price is Rp 90,000.
	   When asked where he got the steel parts from, he evaded
answering the question and tried to explain that as long as it was
``strong and could hold stalls'', nobody should bother about where
he got it from.
	   Potential buyers might not bother where he got the items, but
one has good reason to be suspicious.
	   In the middle of this month, Jakarta was rocked by riots.
Official figures record that 4,940 buildings were damaged, burnt
down or looted. More than 4,200 of these were shops, shopping
malls, restaurants and automobile workshops while more than 500
were bank offices.
	   Sudirdja, a man looking for cassette recorders at an electronics
shop on Jl. Kembang Sepatu, said that a few days earlier, a man
offered him a TV for only Rp 80,000.
	   ``It was Friday or Saturday (May 15 or May 16)... I don't
remember which. A man tried to sell me a 14-inch Detron TV-set for
Rp 80,000. Nowadays, that should go for Rp 500,000 minimum,'' he
said.
	   He added that he was too afraid to buy anything from the man,
who seemed to insist on selling the TV to him.
	   ``He held my upper arm... practically begging me to buy it from
him. I told him to let go and walked off quickly,'' Sudirdja said.
	   About 250 meters from Kembang Sepatu is Pasar Poncol, a market
famous for selling spare parts at low prices. Opposite it, one can
view the damaged buildings. From Jl. Let. Jen. Soeprapto to Jl.
Tanah Tinggi III, roads are lined with charred ruins of buildings
and houses.
	   Iman, who works at a stall selling aluminum and steel at Pasar
Poncol, said that mobs burned a house to the ground in front of his
eyes, after burning two cars in its garage.
	   ``There were eight people living in that place... all eight went
out of the back door and ran away. They too could have been burnt
otherwise.''
	   After burning down the house where the eight people lived, the
mob went straight to the next-door house. This house, which had no
back door, belonged to a jamu (Indonesian herbal drink) seller.
	   ``She (the jamu seller) went up onto her roof, jumped onto the
next building and escaped out of its back door,'' he said.
	   He said hundreds of people looted all the houses and buildings
before burning them.
	   When asked where he thought the loot was being sold, he answered
without hesitation.
	   ``Around here, booty is sold at Jl. Kembang Sepatu,'' Iman said.
	   At a market in Taman Puring, Kebayoran Lama, South Jakarta,
where used items, mainly electronic goods, are sold, the scene was
almost the same.
	   A customer at an electronics shop there said that a week ago he
bought a set of 300-watt high-quality speakers for Rp 50,000 from
``those men outside.'' They are sold for Rp 145,000 minimum in
shops, he said.
	   He said that he knew he was buying stolen goods but was not
bothered about it.
	   ``Owning a stolen set of speakers is not as risky as owning a
stolen car, for instance,'' he said.
	   Morals
	   The risk of getting caught should not be people's primary
concern however, according to the deputy chairman of the Indonesian
Council of Ulemas, Ali Yafie.
	   ``Morally, a person is committing multiple sins when selling
goods that he or she looted,'' Ali said.
	   ``Why? Looting is stealing accompanied with violence. To top it
off, the person is making an income off someone else's sweat and
hard work, by selling it off while the victim can only cry at the
loss.''
	   The person buying or selling looted goods is sinful as well.
	   ``There is real moral damage when a person buys something which
belongs to a person who is probably crying over a loss accompanied
by terror; looting,'' Ali said.
	   ``Everybody is doing his or her best to survive in these bad
conditions. And yet, it is only during these trying times that
one's character is revealed.''
	   Ali said that it was ``all the more wrong'' if people did it out
of hunger.
	   ``When a person is being tested and his physical being wins over
his morality, he has sinned. If he is really hungry, he should ask.
Why steal and cause harm?''
	   During the recent riots, however, many people were not worrying
about whether they were sinning. To them, it was time to party.
Men, women, adults and children were seen carrying looted items
with big smiles on their face.
	   The government and religious public figures have called on
people to return the booty.
	   West Jakarta mayor Soetardjianto, in charge of the area which
suffered most from the riots, has said that looters who give up
their booty voluntarily would not be prosecuted.
	   West Jakarta Military District Commander Lt. Col. Amril Amir
said last week that 557 alleged looters and two trucks of stolen
property were being held at the West Jakarta police station pending
further investigation.

	   KUALA Lumpur police chief Datuk Kamaruddin Ali held a meeting
recently with representatives of the Malaysian AIDS Council,
Pemadam and Pengasih (ex-addicts' association) to seek their input
on how to deal with the growing dadah problem in the city.
	   At the meeting which was also attended by representatives of the
National Dadah Agency, Kamaruddin spoke frankly about the problem
and the constraints faced by his department in tackling it.
	   He should be complimented for the initiative to have a free and
frank exchange of views with leading NGOs concerning dadah and
AIDS.
	   City folks are all too familiar with the perennial problem of
dadah addiction in the infamous Chow Kit and Lorong Haji Taib
areas.
	   In 1994, an operation code-named Ops Zombies was launched to rid
the city of addicts. Some 8,000 addicts were removed and placed in
rehabilitation centres throughout the country.
	   However, in late 1996, the areas once again became the haunt of
addicts despite police operations to nab them.
	   The problem is there are insufficient treatment and
rehabilitation facilities for hard-core addicts.
	   And it is the hard-core addicts who have to be ``tackled'' as
they are responsible for about 50 per cent of petty and property
crimes in the city.
	   Several proposals were discussed at the dialogue. These included
seeking the co-operation of the private sector to offer employment
to rehabilitated addicts in the plantation sector, encouraging the
setting up of more private rehabilitation centres, and identifying
suitable old buildings which can be used as ``drop-in centres'' for
addicts to receive meals and counselling.
	   These are proposals which will only be implemented after they
have been discussed in depth and approved by various quarters and
the authorities concerned.
	   Malaysia is fighting an uphill battle against dadah. According
to official statistics there are some 200,000 registered dadah
addicts.
	   Last year, some 36,284 dadah addicts were identified. Of these
17,342 were first-time offenders and 18,942 repeat offenders.
	   Selangor recorded the highest number of addicts with 5,536 cases
followed by the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur with 5,026.
	   In an effort to curb dadah abuse, the Government will embark on
a 25-year strategy, focusing efforts on schoolchildren by
inculcating values and awareness of the dangers of dadah.
	   However, government action alone is inadequate to deal with this
massive social menace.
	   What is needed is the galvanising of the entire Malaysian
community including NGOs, concerned groups, the private sector,
religious bodies and parents to mount a full-scale attack on the
country's No. 1 enemy.

	   Recently, scientists in Uncle Sam's country have been able to
concoct a drug by the name of Viagra, which has become an instant
best seller throughout the world. I do not know whether this wonder
drug has reached Indonesia, but in other countries it is being sold
at US$80 per tablet, although the official price in the U.S. is
only $10 per tablet, quite expensive even there.
	   I am confident that the scientists who produced this wonder
tablet will undoubtedly become as rich as the inventor of computer
software. Why on earth have I made such a long prologue? Because it
will make a septuagenarian feel young again as if he were a
teenager and married couples who for years hoped for an offspring
may regard this wonder drug as a godsend.
	   Now I have to disclose the function of this wonder tablet. It is
an aphrodisiac against impotence. But in Indonesia there is a
generic medicine which has the same effect and has been known since
time immemorial.
	   It is called Pasak Bumi and originates from the jungles of
Kalimantan. Actually, it is the name of a tree and the bark is cut
into small pieces and boiled in water; the boiled extract gives
this medicine its magical effect.
	   Here is my colleague's story about trying the potent medicine.
	   After having drunk it, he immediately felt as though his body
was on fire and he was highly aroused. Naturally, his spouse was
surprised at her husband's extraordinary newfound virility. Only a
dousing of ice-cold water could bring things back to ``normal'', so
to speak.
	   But the after effect was severe hemorrhoids and severe bleeding
every time he answered the call of nature. It was also a big drain
on his wallet but he could not seek help from a practitioner of
Western medicine. In the end, only a Chinese quack remedy delivered
him from his nagging affliction. I share this anecdote with the
benevolent intention of warning readers of the side effects of such
aphrodisiacs!

Prosecutor defends American tour of Tibetan atlas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief prosecutor defended Monday the
legality of sending a 300-year-old medical atlas on a museum tour
of the United States despite protests from Siberian Buddhists.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov was speaking in Buryatia, the
region of southwestern Siberia whose Buddhists leaders tried to
prevent the ``Tibetan Medical Atlas'' from leaving.
	   The feared the 17th-century atlas would not be properly
protected during scheduled exhibitions in Atlanta, Washington,
Bloomington, Ind., and Newark, N.J.
	   ``The legitimacy of the atlas being exhibited in the U.S. is
beyond doubt,'' Skuratov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Skuratov defended police who beat unarmed monks protesting in
Ulan Ude, the capital of Buryatia, the day the atlas was removed
from a local museum.
	   He said the monks ``staged not only pickets outside the museum
building, but also offered resistance to bodies of power and made
an attempt to put pressure on the authorities.''
	   The atlas is revered as part of Buryatia's heritage. It was
seized by the Soviet government in 1936 and has remained in the
Buryatia Historical Museum since then.

<TEXT>
	   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia Pacific director
Hubert Neiss said Saturday that it was highly unlikely that the
next installment of the rescue package brokered for Indonesia by
the fund would be further delayed.
	   Neiss indicated that the economic reform program and the latest
political developments were very positive and were being welcomed
not only in Indonesia, but also in the rest of the world.
	   ``I think everybody agrees that substantial progress on the
political side has been made within a very short time... on human
rights, labor rights, and on other issues,'' he told a media
conference at the end of his four-day fact finding mission here.
	   The third tranche of US$1 billion was initially scheduled to be
handed over to Indonesia on June 4, but was delayed because of the
political turmoil which led to the resignation of former president
Soeharto and the ascension of his long-serving aide B.J. Habibie to
the presidency.
	   The IMF is committed to providing $10 billion of the US$43
billion bailout fund which the agency brokered to bail out
Indonesia's ailing economy.
	   The IMF has so far disbursed $4 billion of the $10 billion
promised.
	   Release of the aid is crucial because a number of other
multilateral and bilateral donors are taking their lead on
Indonesia from the IMF. Should the IMF decide to resume payments,
approximately $33 billion in aid pledged by the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and major donor countries will also become
available.
	   Although Neiss has often said the IMF mandate was for economic
affairs, he stressed that social and political stability could not
be neglected.
	   ``Therefore, this (political aspect) is part of an overall
assessment,'' said the Austrian economist.
	   Neiss will arrive in Washington on Monday to submit his report
to the IMF board of directors. The board will then decide whether
to resume payments at the program review meeting, which is expected
to take place in the second or third week of June.
	   ``I'm always optimistic,'' he said when asked about the
disbursement of aid and the prospects for economic recovery.
	   He pointed out that Indonesia has a first rate economic team,
and that the new President has given his full support to the
process of economic reform.
	   ``So there is a clear road ahead for efforts to continue the
program,'' he said.
	   He also explained that with the Indonesian economy deteriorating
rapidly in the wake of political unrest, efforts to arrest the
decline and to initiate a recovery must be taken as soon as
possible.
	   ``Every week delayed will make it more difficult,'' he said,
adding that during his meeting with several independent Indonesian
economists, most had projected the country's economy would decline
by at least 10 percent this year.
	   ``I have no reason to dispute their forecasts,'' he said.
	   He explained that although it would be an enormous task for the
Indonesian government to arrest deterioration in the economic
situation and to initiate a recovery, the IMF, World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank would do their best to assist in this task
through both technical and financial assistance.
	   ``We have pledged our full support to Mr. Ginandjar and his
economic team,'' he said.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the country's Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry, was present along with ADB director
Shonji Nishimoto and IMF Jakarta representative Khadim El-eyd at
yesterday's media conference.
	   ``I'm happy to say that we are most impressed with the economic
team which is led by Minister Ginandjar, and there are many
encouraging signs of political reform under the leadership of your
new President,'' Nishimoto said.
	   He expected the ADB to quickly extend the necessary support to
Indonesia, particularly aid to help strengthen the banking sector
and to provide a social safety net.
	   Ginandjar said his first priorities were to deal with the urgent
situation and ensure that sufficient essential food items were
always available.
	   The IMF has agreed that Indonesia can continue to subsidize
essential food items. Under a previous agreement between the
country and the IMF, all such subsidies were to be abolished by
October 1998.
	   ``Deadlines are never absolutely firm, they're always adjusted
according to new circumstances,'' Neiss said.
	   He explained that due to a further decline in the rupiah
exchange rate, funds allocated in the budget to maintain the
subsidies would have to be increased because most of the subsidized
goods were imported.
	   ``So the most important thing is to revive confidence and
strengthen the exchange rate. That is a basic requirement to make
the recovery program work,'' he said.
	   However, he was not able to predict how the exchange rate would
react in the coming months, pointing out that it would depend
largely on how quickly the recovery efforts were launched and how
long it took investor confidence to return.
	   He also added that finding a solution to the country's overseas
private sector debt problem was crucial to reviving confidence in
the economy.
	   Under the 117-point IMF economic reform program agreed with
Indonesia early last month, the rupiah was expected to stabilize at
Rp 6,000 to the U.S. dollar by the end of this year. The currency
is currently trading at around Rp 10,500 per dollar, compared to Rp
2,450 in July last year before the crisis first broke.
	   Neiss said that other macroeconomic assumptions including
economic growth forecasts and the projected inflation rate would
have to be revised because the economy was now much weaker than
when the reform program was last discussed.
	   ``A number of assumptions can no longer be defended ... we want
to build the program on realistic assumptions,'' he said, adding
that the details would be discussed by the government and the IMF
technical team expected to arrive here soon.

	   FUNCTIONAL Software of Australia, a system management tools and
service provider, is investing RM1 million in two Malaysian
companies this year as part of its plans to establish a direct
presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
	   The first, System Management Services (SMS) Sdn Bhd, has been
operational since February this year, and focuses on systems
management services for the local and regional markets. The second
which is in the process of being set up, will focus on providing
network management services.
	   Functional Software's director Alan Main said the company has a
45 per cent equity in the venture, while the remainder belongs to a
group of local developers.
	   ``We will provide part of the working capital and training for
SMS.
	   Skills transfer to the staff at SMS will be achieved through
three specialists from Australia, who will be based at the local
office,'' he said.
	   Main added that SMS' role will be to distribute Functional
Software's system management products and services, as well as
products from other software vendors, to its customers and
resellers around the region.
	   SMS takes over from the now defunct Singapore-based Sun Trade
Software (SEA) Pte Ltd, which has been distributing Functional
Software's products in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Korea
since 1992.
	   Sun Trade's closure and its marketing methods were part of the
stimulus for Functional Software to set up a direct presence.
	   ``Sun Trade was very focused on selling products. That's not
denigrating the need for a product but you have to come at it from
the point of view of product, knowledge and expertise,'' Main said.
	   ``There is a growing awareness of this within IT management.''
	   According to Main, revenues from the local operations will not
be taken out the country, but rather reinvested in a compound
manner.
	   ``Having watched the business grow in Australia, Europe and the
United States, we believe the business model that we have is
relevant to the Malaysian economy. If it grows as expected, we will
consider relocating some of the company's research and development
(RD) activities into the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC),'' he
said.
	   He added that the lower cost and readily available
infrastructure for conducting (RD) in Malaysia, coupled with its
intelligent workforce are some of the factors that attracted
Functional Software to the MSC.
	   ``Malaysia offers a more stable environment for skilled workers
as the threshold for a satisfactory salary in this country is
lower,'' said Main.
	   Most of Functional Software's research is currently conducted in
Australia and the United Kingdom.
	   SMS' general manager James Leong said the advantage of having a
direct presence in Malaysia also means that Functional Software's
resellers and customers are provided with local support, instead of
going to Singapore or Australia as was the case in the past. Its
current resellers are Bass Consulting Sdn Bhd and Applied Business
Systems Sdn Bhd (ABS).
	   Leong expects SMS to achieve an annual growth rate of 30 per
cent for the next five years. He said the economic downturn should
not have a serious effect on this projection, as users are looking
for ways to reduce costs in the current situation.
	   Leong added that Functional Software has developed good systems
management products for the Unix platform, such as COSduty and
COS/Manager which enable IT managers to reduce the operational
costs of their systems.

Pitfalls of learning English from books, JAKARTA POST

	   There is no doubt that English is a very important language.
Just look at all the materials out there in English. Text books
used in universities are mainly in English; the movies in the
cinemas are in English; The Jakarta Post is in English.
	   Of course a lot of materials have been translated. No movie in
the cinema goes without a subtitle. This also applies for English
TV programs. Best sellers have also been translated. But can we
really rely on these translations?
	   With no disrespect to the translators -- it happens to be
something I also do from time to time -- there is an amount of
information missing in the translated version or, at worst, the
information is completely misleading, such as in the film
subtitles.
	   I watched Hook several years ago and in one of the scenes Robin
William's character says, ``I have a problem with heights.'' The
subtitle, however, reads, ``Saya memiliki masalah dengan berat
badan.'' (I have a problem with weight). In Dead Poet's Society
somebody saying, ``I'm not like you'' is translated as ``Saya tidak
suka kamu'' (I don't like you).
	   More examples can be seen on the TV as well. But the most
ridiculous translation I've encountered so far is 'foto cangkir'
(cup photo) for ``mug shot''.
	   To avoid being misled with the information given by the
translations, a good mastery of English is a must. And now that we
are entering the era of globalization, English becomes more
important.
	   More people apparently try to learn English. If they do not have
the time to take an English class, they might go out and buy
English language study books.
	   These books are helpful. You can learn English in the comfort of
your own home whenever you have the time and are in the mood to do
so. However, it is necessary to tread with caution when buying
English language study books.
	   Those books sold by sellers who get on and off buses or trains
are to be avoided. It might be tempting to buy them because they
are so ridiculously cheap but what is more important: the price of
the book or the knowledge inside it?
	   Buying English language study books from prestigious and
well-known bookstores might be a better idea but that doesn't mean
that you are safe.
	   Prestigious bookstores do not necessarily sell prestigious books
as well.
	   On one of my frequent trips to the bookstore, a book called
English Conversations caught my eye. The book was displayed in one
of the well-known bookstores in Indonesia, so I thought it must be
quite good. Out of pure curiosity, I flipped through the pages of
the books just to get an idea of what the book was about.
	   The book has two columns on one page. One column is for the
``English'' version of the conversation while the second column is
in Indonesian.
	   Allow me to enlighten you with some examples. It would be better
if I gave you the Indonesian version first so that you don't get
completely lost. One example reads: Jika kamu takut disuntik, minta
obat saja. The English version reads ``If you afraid of injection
[sic]. Ask for medicine, please.'' As you may have noticed the
English is not really English.
	   None the less, an English speaking person might still understand
what is really meant. Now let's take a look at another example.
	   The context of the conversation this time is about watching TV.
One person wants to know what's on TV, so he asks Acaranya apa? In
English --according to the author of this amazing book -- it is,
``What's the plan?''
	   This book really amazed me. First of all, I was surprised that
somebody actually had the guts to write such a book. Second, there
was a publisher who actually agreed to print the book. Finally,
there was a bookstore manager who actually accepted the book to be
displayed on the shelves.
	   A piece of advice for those who are planning to learn a foreign
language is to get professional help from a professional language
institute. If you really don't have the time to attend a course
then, by all means, buy a book.
	   To help you pick out a book, bring a friend who speaks the
foreign language to get her or his advice on the quality of the
book. If no such friend is available, then avoid buying books from
an obscure publisher. Stick with the well-known and credible
publishers.
	   This doesn't mean that you should not consider picking up any of
these amazing books. If you want to get a cheap laugh then the book
might be a good idea. I know I got a good laugh after reading just
a couple of pages.
	   Imagine what the whole book would do.

	   A group of 18 retired generals are demanding that the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) hold an extraordinary session no later
than July to revoke decrees installing Soeharto as president and
B.J. Habibie as vice president.
	   The deadline was stipulated in a statement made available to the
press yesterday and signed by the group's coordinator, former
Commander of the Army's Strategic Reserves Lt. Gen. (ret.) Achmad
Kemal Idris.
	   The statement said they rejected the agreement reached between
the House of Representative and the government that an
extraordinary session be held in six months time.
	   They argued in their statement that, apart from revoking the
decrees, the Assembly should immediately elect a caretaker
president or presidium.
	   One of the signatories, Let. Gen. (ret.) Ali Sadikin, said
Soeharto could not simply delegate his presidential mandate to his
deputy.
	   ``Such a sudden presidential succession cannot be held just like
that. It must be held before an extraordinary session of the MPR,''
the former governor of Jakarta told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   ``A presidential succession is not like the election of a
village chief. An outgoing president must be held accountable for
all the policies that he or she introduced,'' he said.
	   Under intense pressure from mounting protests, Soeharto resigned
May 21 and handed over power to Habibie.
	   House Speaker Harmoko, after meeting with Habibie on Thursday,
said they had agreed that an extraordinary session of the Assembly
would be held at the end of the year or early next year to set the
date for the polls.
	   Harmoko also brushed aside suggestions that the extraordinary
session would seek an accountability address from Soeharto.
	   ``We, based on the spirit of total reform, declare our rejection
of the said agreement (between the House leaders and Habibie),''
said the statement from the senior officers of the Armed Forces'
1945 generation.
	   They closed their statement, which was signed by Kemal on
Friday, by stating that ``the entire reform movement must be
implemented peacefully and constitutionally''.
	   Other signatories of the statement included former Army chiefs
Gen. (ret.) Makmun Murod and Gen. (ret.) Rudini; former Air Force
chief (ret.) Air Marshal Ashadi Tjahjadi; former Police chief Gen.
(ret.) Awaloedin Djamin; former House/Assembly Speaker Lt. Gen.
(ret.) M. Kharis Suhud; former Secretary for National Development
Operations Lt. Gen. (ret.) Solichin G.P.; former Indonesian
Ambassador to the United States Lt. Gen. (ret.) Hasnan Habib and
former chief of the Army's special force (Kopasandha, now Kopassus)
Lt. Gen. (ret.) Leo Lopulisa.
	   A similar rejection of the agreement between House leaders and
Habibie came from former economic minister Frans Seda.
	   Frans simply said that waiting to hold the extraordinary session
until the end of this year or even next year was simply ``too
long''.
	   But Frans did not specify a particular timeframe for the
Assembly's extraordinary session.
	   Speaking at a seminar on state ideology Pancasila here
yesterday, Frans said the Assembly's extraordinary session would be
a crucial point for the current transitional government to counter
doubts on its ``legality''.
	   He maintained that there was a question of legality surrounding
the current government, which was not only eroding public trust but
also international confidence, evident in the continued stalling of
funds to be disbursed by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``The problem is that an international body will only give
financial assistance to a government which is trustworthy,'' he
said, adding that there should be no detachment in reforming the
economic and political aspects of the nation.
	   ``Fixing politics is part and parcel of remedying the country's
economy,'' he said.

Eds: UPDATES with Albania saying 2,000 new refugees have arrived,
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting in Serbia's explosive
Kosovo province prompted reports Monday of more than a dozen new
deaths and sent thousands of people fleeing into Albania.
	   Conflicting accounts of casualties in the blocked-off areas
could not immediately be sorted out. But the bloodshed appears to
be the worst since early March when Serbian police killed more than
80 people in a crackdown on militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said. They said more were arriving
by the hour.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom had walked for as
many as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a
school. Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Community to intervene ``for ending the
massacre in Kosovo.''
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragical dimensions,''
the statement said.

Foreign ministers of permanent Security Council to meet on South Asian arms race 
</HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will urge the world's powers to find a way
to halt the nuclear arms race in South Asia when foreign ministers
of the U.N. Security Council's permanent members meet this week in
Geneva, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Monday.
	   China fears the recent nuclear weapons tests by India and
Pakistan will set off a chain reaction of other countries obtaining
nuclear weapons and set back disarmament, the senior official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will attend the meeting on
Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the
foreign ministers of Russia, France and Britain, the official said.
	   Tang and Albright, speaking by telephone, jointly proposed
holding the meeting, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
	   China has no proposal for how to respond to the tests, said the
senior official. ``That's why we're meeting. We have to work it
out,'' he said.
	   China does not want India, Pakistan or any other countries to
become nuclear powers, he said. ``We should urge them with one
voice and make them realize it's not in their interest,'' he said.
	   China, taking a turn leading the meeting, also will propose
talking about how to reduce tensions in South Asia, he said.
	   China is worried a South Asian arms race will destabilize the
world, the official said. China needs a stable international
environment so that it can concentrate on its economic development,
he said.
	   Elaborating on previous statements by Beijing about the tests,
he said China was ``infuriated'' when India said it needed nuclear
tests because neighboring China is its top threat.
	   ``We are not their enemy. It's not true,'' he said, adding the
accusation was an insult.
	   China had improved relations with India in recent years, the
official said. He added the two countries have many similarities,
including a history of colonialism and ``the same task to feed,
clothe, house and educate our people.''
	   China conducted its last nuclear test in 1996 and declared a
moratorium. It was one of the first countries to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   But even the treaty allows countries to resume testing if their
``supreme national security'' is threatened, the official said.
	   ``I'm not saying China will do it. But we have to take into
account this development. China is urging the world to do
something,'' he said.
	   The official denied China has helped Pakistan, its close ally,
develop nuclear weapons.
	   He confirmed that President Bill Clinton spoke with President
Jiang Zemin by telephone before Pakistan conducted its tests. But
he denied reports Jiang called on Pakistan to forego testing at the
urging of Clinton.
	   Jiang wrote to Pakistani Prime Minister Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif ``on his own absolutely 100 percent,'' he said. ``We don't
like to be preached to. We don't preach to others what they should
do. But we tell them how we feel. We have not minced words with our
friend Pakistan.''

Tensions overwhelm peace moves With India-Pakistan 
</HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Escalating tension over nuclear weapons
appears to have buried the already faltering peace process between
traditional rival neighbors India and Pakistan.
	   Only a year ago, citizens of both countries were applauding what
they hoped to be the start of a new era in their long, stormy
relationship. Then-Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral of India and
his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, meeting at a regional
summit in the Maldives, agreed to open negotiations on a number of
disputes.
	   Now, with the 1998 edition of the seven-nation regional summit a
month away, this time in Sri Lanka, the mood is different. Last
month, India tested nuclear devices May 11-13. In response,
Pakistan claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week.
	   The negotiations Gujral and Sharif kicked off to such fanfare
never got much beyond the stage of bureaucrats wrangling over the
agenda. The centrist Gujral was replaced two months ago by Atal
Bihari Vajpayee who, though considered a moderate, leads the
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party known for Pakistan-bashing.
	   ``Both countries have myopic leaders and fragile economies. They
can't afford a war. There is no choice for India and Pakistan but
to talk to each other,'' said Anand Kumar, political analyst and
professor at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
	   ``Dialogue should continue,'' said Dina Dayalan of the Indian
chapter of the Pakistan-India Peoples' Forum for Peace and
Democracy, a group of private citizens on both sides of the border
who have tried to ease tensions by promoting contacts between
ordinary people.
	   Tariq Rahman, active in the Pakistani counterpart to Dayalan's
group, said the tests set back efforts to build trust by creating a
``tremendous feeling of antagonism'' among ordinary people.
	   He hopes that the ``belligerency'' would die down over time,
enabling leaders of India and Pakistan to meet to discuss how to
avoid using their new weapons of mass destruction. But in the short
term, Rahman said, it is hard to envision such talks.
	   The arms race has long drained both countries, among the poorest
in the world. The United Nations Children's Fund estimated that
between 1990 and 1996, India spent an average of 2 percent of its
annual budget on education, and 14 percent on defense. Pakistan
spent just 1 percent on education, and a whopping 31 percent on
defense.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. The chief bone of
contention between officially Islamic Pakistan and predominately
Hindu India is the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is divided
between them and claimed in its entirety by both countries.
	   If Vajpayee and Sharif do hold one-on-one talks at next month's
regional summit, the main topic is likely to be the region's new
nuclear realities, pushing efforts to normalize relations into the
background.
	   Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who leads a coalition of parties that
wants India-held Kashmir _ the country's only Muslim-majority state
_ to break away from India, said the rivalry over Kashmir led to
the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan.
	   ``The main root of this is Kashmir. They should open serious
talks to resolve the Kashmiri issue,'' said Geelani, who wants
Kashmir either to form an independent country or to join Pakistan.

Eds: UPDATES with Iranian reaction; CORRECTS tests conducted last
<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A leading Islamic organization on
Monday expressed ``deep concern'' over nuclear tests carried out
last month by India and Pakistan and urged immediate talks by the
two nations.
	   The Jiddah-based Organization of the Islamic Conference said in
a statement from its secretary-general, Azeddine Laraki, that it
had wanted the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in South
Asia.
	   The ``international community must seriously encourage both
India and Pakistan to expediently conclude a non-aggression
agreement with the aim of ensuring the promotion of peace and
security in the region,'' the statement said.
	   It said the OIC expresses ``deep concern over this serious
development.''
	   The Gulf nation of Bahrain also urged both India and Pakistan to
exercise restraint, government-controlled newspapers reported
Monday.
	   Iran, a leading member of the OIC, said although it is faced
with a ``new security situation'' following the tests, Tehran will
not build an atomic bomb. ``The present arena concerns only India
and Pakistan,'' Iran's Defense Minister Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani was
quoted as saying Monday in a newspaper interview.
	   India exploded five nuclear devices two weeks ago, prompting
Pakistan to follow suit with six despite warnings from the U.N.
Security Council, the United States and other nations.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since both countries
gained independence from colonial British rule in 1947.
	   The 55-member Organization of the Islamic Conference said in its
statement that it hoped Pakistan's nuclear explosions would not
fuel anti-Muslim sentiment.
	   It urged ``international public opinion to foil every biased
attempt aimed at using the latest nuclear explosions as a pretext
to launch an unjustifiable offensive against the Islamic (world).''
	   It added that Islamic states have always supported elimination
of nuclear arms.
	   Pakistan is the only Muslim nation known to have developed a
nuclear bomb.

Prosecutor reports progress in solving contract murders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The number of solved contract killings is on the
rise, but Russia's most famous killing remains uncracked,
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said in an interview published
Monday.
	   Skuratov told the newspaper Novaya Gazeta that his office had
solved 70 contract killings in 1996 and the number rose to 132 in
1997. ``I think we shall do a still better job this year,'' he
said.
	   Skuratov said that many top investigators had returned to the
prosecutor general's office because of improved salaries and better
working conditions.
	   He said that his office was successful in solving the killing of
investigative journalist Dmitry Kholodov, who died in October 1994
when a briefcase supposedly provided by an informant exploded in
his hands. Three suspects in the case have been arrested.
	   But the contract killing of TV host Vladislav Listyev, who was
gunned down outside his Moscow home on March 1, 1995, remains
unsolved.
	   ``The Listyev case is very hard,'' Skuratov told the newspaper.
``In no case has the Prosecutor General's Office felt so much
all-round pressure,'' he said.
	   But, he said, regardless of pressure and the cost of the lengthy
investigation, his office will take the investigation to its
conclusion.

<TEXT>
	   IT is perhaps a misnomer to describe Malaysia's present economic
state as an ``economic downturn'' for not all parties involved in
the economy are facing a slump.
	   For those that are export-oriented such as manufacturing- and
plantation-based firms, the present period is as good as it gets.
	   One good example of such a company is Polymate Holdings Berhad.
	   Its main and most profitable subsidiary is Automative Battery
Industries Sdn Bhd (ABI). Presently, ABI relies on the export
market for 65 per cent of its turnover and it expects this figure
to rise another 10 per cent in the near future.
	   Furthermore, ABI's impending expansion programme to cater for
strong overseas demand will make it one of the biggest battery
manufacturers in Malaysia and this region.
	   It was the idea of Ng Kim Weng, Polymate's group managing
director and ABI's managing director, to ensure that the export
market becomes ABI's mainstay.
	   Ng had, from early on, realised that companies which rely
heavily on domestic market might find their product demand
eventually reaching a saturation point.
	   However, he explained if the company is export-oriented, then
the opportunities are limitless as the world becomes its
marketplace.
	   His foresight has since then paid handsome dividends as ABI's
expansion plan is expected to increase the group's turnover by 15
to 20 per cent to reach RM80 million for its financial year ending
Sept 30 this year.
	   Ng recently took time to speak to Management Times. From the
observation made during the interview, it was evident that he is a
leader without airs and capable of understanding his people's
viewpoints.
	   The humble characteristics can perhaps be attributed to his vast
experience in the sales line.
	   Q: How would you describe your management style?
	   A: I try to be extra careful when dealing with problems
involving human relationship especially when it concerns employees,
partners or customers.
	   Therefore, I try to put myself in their shoes before making
decisions concerning them. The other parties' feelings must always
be taken into consideration.
	   Furthermore, I personally try to and likewise expect my
employees to get things done fast and well.
	   In other words, I don't believe in procrastinating.
	   This is important for day-to-day decisions, as we can't afford
to delay decision making. Although planning is important, we can't
be in the planning stage for too long.
	   However, for long term decisions, I expect my employees to have
proper planning. They should not act rashly and make on-the-spot
decisions without having the correct information.
	   Q: Should managers then rely solely on hard facts when
formulating long- term plans?
	   A: Actually, it should be a combination of intuitive feeling and
hard facts.
	   If you do long-term planning based solely on hard facts, it can
turn out to be very misleading.
	   This is because whatever happened before might not occur again.
	   Alternatively, what has not happened in the past might happen
this time around.
	   As such, it's important that apart from relying on facts, we
also have to place confidence on our observational skills.
	   Q: In that case, what do you think of decision-making process
based on intuition?
	   A: Well, that basically involves experience.
	   Generally, people who have undergone a similar situation
previously would know what to expect and how to react.
	   For example, they would know what decisions to take to counter
problems created by the present economic downturn.
	   This is true even if the problem is not exactly similar to a
past problem. Just having that long experience in the industry
would have prepared them to handle problems better.
	   This is what separates the top level and middle level managers.
	   Q: As such, in terms of weightage, how would you rank factors
like experience, on-the-job training or formal studies in
developing an efficient manager?
	   A: I feel that observation is very important as from it, you
would be able to envision the future requirements of the company.
	   Meanwhile, on-the-job training is an on-going process that needs
to be experienced on a continuous basis.
	   However, employees without high academic qualification should
not be seen as inferior.
	   To me, what's more important is their character, how much
initiative they exhibit.
	   If they have a lot of initiative but are handicapped by the lack
of high education. I am sure they will spend much time observing
and learning, for example via on-the-job training, to overcome
their limitation.
	   Therefore, it's not surprising that they at times can perform
better than their more educated colleagues.
	   Q: Are you saying that even the top level managers don't need
proper qualification?
	   A: What I am saying is that academic qualification prepares
managers to handle problems in the theoretical sense.
	   So, if a problem occurs and graduate managers have been taught
to deal with that particular problem in university, they will be
able to overcome it.
	   But, one should not forget that managers who rose from the rank
and file too would be able to perform efficiently.
	   They, in their journey up the corporate ladder, would have
learned many things that would have helped hone their
decision-making skills.
	   Not surprisingly, at times, their solutions are considered
superior to those from the textbooks.
	   Q: You rose from rank and file. How has this, and your
background in sales, prepared you for your present post?
	   A: Basically, my sales experience has taught me to deal with
people efficiently.
	   I believe managers with sales background would have cultivated
the necessary skills to deal with the needs of different sets of
people.
	   As such, this gives them a great advantage over, say an
accountant who is purely analytical in functioning as a top level
manager.
	   Q: Are you then implying that top managers should have some
sales background?
	   A: No, that is not necessary. But let's say if you want to start
a business and you have prior knowledge on sales, that will help
you tremendously.
	   This is because, it will help you sell your products better, but
in the end, it still boils down to the character of the person.
	   Q: Being export-oriented, what kind of priority do you place on
research and development (RD) activities?
	   A: Actually, we are one of the few companies in the industry
which have invested a lot of money in RD activities.
	   We know that to increase our export market share, we have to
ensure our products meet international standards and have
consistent quality.
	   In the last year or so, we have invested more than half a
million ringgit for RD activities.
	   Q: Presently, retrenchment is a hot issue. How are you dealing
with this?
	   A: Well, for the time being, retrenchment is not something that
is in our dictionary. But hypothetically speaking, if there is a
need to exercise that option, we have to take into consideration
the individual's performance and his/her length of service.
	   Nevertheless, I don't subscribe to the ``last in first out''
idea.
	   That is not fair to the productive employees who might be
contributing more than the senior employees.
	   Q: How do you view change management in the context of our
present economic situation?
	   A: To me, we have to transform according to the changes in the
market.
	   We cannot rest on our past laurels, as success is never a
guaranteed attainment.
	   Just because you were successful before does not mean that you
will be successful later, especially if you don't change according
to the dictates of the marketplace.
	   The only way to be prepared for change is to get the proper
exposure.
	   For example, companies can send their employees overseas for
exposure and also have them attend seminars regularly.
	   Q: How do you accommodate young and ambitious employees in the
organisation without creating animosity among the senior employees?
	   A: I have on many occasions seen enthusiastic employees' ideas
given during management meetings shot down by senior managers for
no apparent reason.
	   It's my opinion that we must not discourage eager employees like
them as they are very capable in offering solid ideas.
	   Therefore, it is important that the top management let everyone
in the company know that they will support new ideas.

Hunt begins for fabled czarist treasure 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) - German treasure hunters have begun
combing a beach in Lithuania for the famed czarist Amber Room,
allegedly buried there by Nazi forces, the Baltic News Service
reported Monday.
	   The beachcombers believe the cache includes panels from Czar
Peter the Great's famed Amber Room, an ornate hall whose walls were
made from the priceless, golden brown amber.
	   It was a gift to Peter the Great from Prussian King Friedrich
Wilhelm I, but the Nazis looted it from Leningrad in 1941.
	   For the rest of World War II, the treasure was hidden in eastern
Prussia, in the town of Kralovec.
	   The search is focused in the dunes of the Neringa peninsula, a
wind-swept sliver of land that runs parallel to Lithuania's Baltic
Sea coast for more than 100 kilometers (60 miles).
	   The German team is following leads by a former resident of the
area who says he saw Nazi officers carrying boxes off a warship in
1944 and then bury them along the shore, BNS said.
	   It did not name the resident or members of the German team.
	   The fate of the Amber Room has long been a mystery and a source
of speculation. The German government has said the panels were
destroyed during the 1945 Soviet invasion of nearby Konigsberg now
Kaliningrad, Russia. But Moscow has long insisted that the Nazis
hid the treasure.

Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Albania reporting 2,000 new refugees,
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Hundreds of villagers fled across
the border to Albania on Monday, trying to escape heavy fighting in
Serbia's explosive Kosovo province amid reports that dozens of
ethnic Albanians had been killed.
	   Conflicting accounts of casualties in the sealed-off areas could
not immediately be resolved. But the bloodshed appears to be the
worst since early March, when Serb police killed more than 80
people in a crackdown on militants and their families.
	   Authorities in Serbia are trying to block independence sentiment
in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. More than
200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the beginning of
March.
	   About half of the Serb province is controlled by militant
Albanians and many regions are blocked off, either by Serbs or
Albanians.
	   Serb authorities claimed Sunday to have killed several dozen
militants in four villages in the Decani region of western Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanian officials said Monday that 37 Albanians had been
killed over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed another village, the Albanians said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, Serb
sources said. The area is 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of the
regional capital, Pristina.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania in the last day,
Albanian authorities said Monday. They said more were arriving by
the hour
	   Albanian authorities were providing free food and clothes for
the refugees _ many of whom walked for hours to reach safety.
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Community to intervene ``for ending the
massacre in Kosovo.''
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragical dimensions,''
the statement said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, named 10 people it said were killed Sunday when Serb
police stormed the village of Poklek, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west
of Pristina. It said one had had his throat slit.
	   It said Serb police burst into homes in Poklek, pulled out
villagers and told them to ``go to Albania and never return.''
Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday.
	   The state-run daily Politika on Monday blamed ethnic Albanian
``terrorist groups'' for the deaths of several people, saying the
militants shelled villages near the border town of Junik as they
escaped into Albania.

	   ENTERPRISE resource planning solutions vendor PeopleSoft Inc is
setting up a direct presence in Malaysia with the opening of an
office in Kuala Lumpur within the next three to six months.
	   The local office will kick off operations by providing customer
support services to the company's distributors and partners here,
said PeopleSoft Asia Pte Ltd's managing director Asean Robert
Squires.
	   According to Squires, PeopleSoft will also garner feedback from
these partners in terms of additional requirements which are later
channelled through the company's local outfit.
	   ``The office will progressively grow to assist our partners in
the execution of business,'' he told Computimes during a Press
briefing in Subang Jaya last Thursday.
	   Squires said PeopleSoft is continuing to invest in Asean despite
the current economic downturn.
	   ``The company is re-focusing on its core competencies and
restructuring the business to be ready for the upturn of the
economy when the time comes.''
	   He added that the time was right for the company to continue
investing in the region.
	   He said the company is confident that this is an effective and
strategic decision for PeopleSoft and its distributors and
partners.
	   Commenting on the company's local distribution channel, Squires
said PeopleSoft would maintain the existing structure, with no
plans to either reduce or expand the network.
	   The company's business this year, he said, is projected to grow
but he declined to disclose any figures.
	   ``It will be a slower one as compared to the company's growth in
the last year,'' he said.
	   At the same event, Squires also announced the official opening
of a new office site in Singapore which serves as the company's
business hub for Asean and the launch of PeopleSoft Version 7.5
enterprise application suite.
	   The new suite, which offers the financials, distribution and
manufacturing modules, will be available in the region next month
while the human resources and payroll systems will be in the market
in the fourth quarter of this year.
	   The new release leverages on technology features of PeopleSoft
7, for instance, Web client, a high performance three-tier
processing option and online analytical processing (OLAP)
integration providing additional technology enhancements in its Web
client, application server, workflow, and support for IBM AS/400
computing platform.
	   Key features in PeopleSoft's Version 7.5 include global
application and functionality such as global supply chain
management optimism capability, support for European and Monetary
Union and international accounting practices, a European Payroll
application, and enhancements to support regional and
multinationals.
	   Other features include applications such as the Treasury
application suite and a new Expenses application; Stock
Administration and Quality, Performance Management application
suite, a new Demand Planning application, and an enhanced Budgets
and Human Resources application.

	   YOUR magazine rightly suggests that the country's engine of
growth -the construction sector - will and is gradually going to
choke in the article entitled Spluttering Along In Fits And Starts
(MB, March 16 issue).
	   It also correctly points out that the onus of dragging the
sector out of the quagmire will lie heavily on the shoulders of the
three-year old Construction Industry Development Board or CIDB as
it is more locally known.
	   And boy what a task it has ahead of it! From the chart
(Performance Of The Malaysian Construction Industry 1968-1998)
which accompanied the article, it is perfectly clear that the local
property/construction cycle is no different from that of any other
country. We must, like them, go through a boom and bust period.
We've had a veritable booming era for the last 10 years or so and
will, for certain, go through a bust period. The question is, for
how long or how short. And will it be a long but relatively
painless, numbing affair or a short and excruciating period of
contraction?
	   The 12-member board was established on Dec 1, 1994 to
co-ordinate the activities of the local construction industry and
provide training and accreditation to local and foreign workers to
ease the shortage of skilled workers in the construction sector.
	   With the economic slowdown and the government's ongoing forced
repatriation of many illegal workers, CIDB's role in enhancing the
skills of both the locals and the legally employed foreign workers
is all the more vital. Born at the height of the rocketing, booming
real estate/construction development, CIDB will now have to cut its
teeth and prove its mettle in a gradually deteriorating
environment. The stormy winds of change is already being felt. Bank
Negara Malaysia has dealt the first blow by labelling the real
estate sector a non-productive sector; credit has been cut off and
demand has plummeted.
	   CIDB, to its credit, has already taken the first step in
carrying out its ambitious targets. It has already set up, or is in
the process of setting up, construction academies around the
country with the primary aim of training the relatively unskilled
workforce to meet the challenges of the millennium.
	   It has also gone boldly to where no local consortia has ventured
before ... it clinched several construction deals in Bosnia, Turkey
and India and as your article states, it is also eyeing
opportunities in Lebanon, Tunisia, etc. All this is fine and dandy
when the construction sector was booming and the local pie was too
small to be shared by so many fishes.
	   The situation has changed now and it is for the worse. CIDB must
now change track ... it must not act merely as the lynchpin for the
big and rich construction companies by clinching lucrative overseas
deals, but make a strong effort to assist the smaller fries in the
local construction sector.
	   With the local situation gradually deteriorating, many medium
and smaller construction firms will find their very existence
severely threatened. CIDB might well be their saviour in these
difficult times.
	   CIDB would do well to use this economic slowdown as a golden
opportunity to push the smaller firms, who cannot yet compete on a
global scale, into recognising the need for greater emphasis on
innovation, and accelerate the restructuring of these firms from a
labour-intensive dependency to one of high technology in line with
the country's push towards information technology.
	   For sure, it won't be an easy task but this is where the
government has placed its trust in the CIDB. CIDB, therefore, will
have to bring these small firms, kicking and screaming, into the
era of a highly competitive domestic and foreign markets.
	   It has the unenviable task of ensuring: that the local
construction industry does not allow the stormy winds of change to
go unheeded, that local construction businesses - whether
Bumiputera companies or otherwise -respond proactively to the
nation's changing circumstances, and that in order to back
Malaysia's global ambitions, Malaysian construction firms must be
determined to develop advanced strategies and technology, increase
expenditure in research and development, skills training, education
and infrastructure.
	   With its zero growth forecast for the local industry, CIDB
should see this period as the best opportunity to get its act
going, to achieve all the aims and aspirations that led to its
creation by the government and to be the catalyst in a soon-to-be
moribund industry ... oh, what a challenge! Goh Kim Leong Cheras

Karachi Stock Market falls 128.76 to record low 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The Karachi Stock Market hit a record
low on Monday falling 128.76 points to close at 911.44.
	   ``There was massive liquidation by foreign investors and this
put immense pressure on the market,'' said Hasan Davar, a trader
with UBS Securities.
	   The Karachi Stock Exchange opened Monday for the first time
since Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices last Thursday and a
sixth one on Saturday, bringing global condemnation and threats of
economic sanctions.
	   Within hours of the first five explosions, Pakistan's president
declared a state of emergency and froze all foreign currency
accounts to try to prevent a panic exodus of foreign capital from
the country.
	   Pakistan's foreign reserves stand at dlrs 1.2 billion, which is
barely enough to pay for the next six weeks of imports, say
financial analysts.
	   Pakistan's Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said last Friday that
his government was preparing an economic recovery plan that would
boost exports and reduce imports.
	   Sharif announced across the board budget cuts of 25 percent in
an attempt to reduce the impact of economic sanction.
	   The stock market began to tumble immediately after India
exploded the first of five nuclear devices three weeks ago.
	   On May 8, the last trading day before India's May 11 explosion,
the stock market closed at 1551. It has been on a downward slide
since then.

	   IT IS NOT easy to establish a market base in Malaysia for a
fledging Middle Eastern airline - especially when that airline does
not even fly to Kuala Lumpur.
	   Call it a daunting task, but that was the situation in 1991 when
Emirates, the international airline of the United Arab Emirates,
recognised Malaysia's potential and appointed a local company as
its general sales agent (GSA). Says Emirates manager Malaysia Alban
Lee, `There was much misconception and ignorance among the locals.
In 1991, marketing Emirates in Malaysia was difficult. We were six
years old. There was no flight out of Kuala Lumpur. If you wanted
to fly with Emirates, you had to go to Singapore.' Another
stumbling block was the common perception that Middle Eastern
airlines are unreliable and offer scant frills. Fortunately, there
was some consolation that many Westerners living in Malaysia
already knew then of Emirates' growing reputation for fine service.
	   `The primary aim at that time was to create awareness locally.
The approach was to tell people that Emirates was an international,
not a Middle Eastern, airline. The focus was on our services and
product features. We were considered innovative for introducing
inflight features such as a video system and a telephone for every
seat, and fax machines,' says Lee.
	   He adds that when people talked about the airline those days, it
was either with envy or curiosity, depending on whether or not they
were familiar with its service. He should know. Although he was
appointed to head Emirates' Malaysian operations only in October
1996 when it began plying the Kuala Lumpur-Dubai route with three
flights weekly, his ties with the airline extends further back.
	   He was formerly with Emirates' GSA, Maple Travel (M) Sdn Bhd,
and was its assistant general manager before joining the airline.
Seven years on, the groundwork has proved to be solid. On April 1,
the airline thickened its KL-Dubai route with a fourth frequency.
By next year, Emirates would have added another flight. It plans to
incre s frequency in the sector to daily flights in two years.
	   The sector's passenger traffic has a healthy load factor of 82
per cent, and generated about RM20 million in income for the year
ended March 31, 1998. This exceeded projections by 32 per cent.
	   With Emirates taking delivery of two Boeing 777s and the first
of 16 Airbus A330-200s by the end of the current financial year,
passenger capacity will climb 20 per cent. The passenger traffic is
forecast to grow by 25 per cent over the next financial year,
indicating the airline's confidence that its yield will remain
largely unaffected by Malaysia's economic slowdown.
	   In fact, the ringgit's depreciation has made Malaysia a more
attractive destination and has swollen demand for cargo space due
to higher exports.
	   However, as a scheduled airline, Emirates's priority is its
passenger business.
	   On the whole, Emirates' Malaysian operations contributed
approximately 15 per cent of the airline's Pacific Rim revenue. Lee
estimates that 80 per cent of Emirates' passengers in the KL-Dubai
sector are holiday- makers. Business travellers are far fewer
because trade between Malaysia and the Middle East is nominal.
	   In the beginning, Emirates in Malaysia drew a sizeable chunk of
its business from the expatriate community. Says Lee, `They
responded very well because they were already familiar with what we
had to offer.
	   Typically, they had more exposure to Emirates in their home
countries and needed less convincing. To put it arrogantly, they
had been waiting for the product and now it's here.
	   `It's more like a following. Most of these passengers fly to
Dubai and proceed to popular Mediterranean destinations such as
Turkey, Greece and Cyprus. For those who are sceptical or know
little about us, we usually surprise by delivering more than
expected. Eventually, people will learn to expect more from us.
That will be the second phase. That is why we are always
improving.' Emirates has a history of confounding the doubting
Thomases. In his message in a corporate brochure, Emirates chairman
Sheikh Ahmed Saeed Al Maktoum wrote, `The international regard in
which Emirates is held today is very different from the tolerant
scepticism which greeted its arrival on the aviation scene.' From
an airline launched on October 25, 1985, with two leased aircraft
and three routes, it has matured into the leading Middle Eastern
airline with 44 destinations, the latest (to Malta) launched on
March 30.
	   Amsterdam is served as a cargo-only destination with Boeing 747
freighter leased from Atlas Air.
	   It has gained attention in particular for its posh inflight
amenities and its lengthening list of awards (151 at last count),
mainly from trade and travel publications.
	   Fleet expansion is a key component of the airline's growth
programme.
	   Emirates currently operates a fleet of 22 aircraft: nine Airbus
A310-300s, six Airbus A300-600Rs, three Boeing 777-200As and four
Boeing 777-200Bs.
	   In November 1996, Emirates ordered 16 Airbus A330-200 aircraft,
with options on a further seven, to replace its existing Airbus
fleet.
	   Emirates will begin receiving the A330-200s from January 1999,
with deliveries to be completed in 2002. The new Airbus fleet will
be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines as are the Boeing 777s.
Emirates will be the only airline in the world with a fleet fully
powered by Rolls-Royce engines.
	   In August 1997, Sheikh Ahmed signed an agreement for two more
Boeing 777-200 (long-range versions) on which Emirates has an
option. The aircraft are expected to join the fleet during the last
quarter of 1998.
	   Like other carriers, Emirates also has to keep increasing its
flights and destinations to strengthen business. An airline that
aspires `to be a world-class, medium-sized airline by the year
2000' cannot afford to do less.
	   `We are a young airline. We need to add frequencies to our
destinations, including KL. We believe frequency sells,' says Lee.
`We are also working to obtain more rights into new areas, but this
can be difficult.' Fleet upgrading and award-winning service aside,
Emirates still has quite a bit to aim for in Malaysia. Heading the
agenda is making KL a mini-hub in the region. Explains Lee, `At the
moment, at least 17 Emirates flights go through Singapore weekly.
We hope to bring some of the flights to KL. Of course, the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport in Sepang has to prove that it is as
efficient and modern as it promises to be. If it can offer better
handling, more airlines will come. Our goal is to fly more people
into KL to take connecting flights to elsewhere in the region.' The
other aspect to work on is to encourage more inbound traffic.
	   According to Lee, most UAE nationals do not know much about
Malaysia although it has many plus points such as the relatively
lower costs and availability of halal food. He adds that all
Emirates online stations have been directed to sell the Far East.
In addition, Emirates in Dubai is working with Tourism Malaysia to
promote Malaysia as a holiday spot.
	   To gear up for imminent growth, the Malaysian operations will be
increasing its staff, now comprising 15 people. The airline had
planned to fly from KL to Jakarta but this has been put on hold due
to Indonesia's economic crisis. There will eventually be flights
from KL to Perth in Australia, as well.
	   Says Lee, `We are committed. We are here to stay. Our Malaysia
operations have proved to be profitable. We have as many
frequencies as several other Far East destinations that came online
earlier than did KL.'

	   CRUDE palm oil physicals are expected to hit a softer note this
week in tandem with the movement of crude palm oil futures prices
on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange, a dealer said.
	   Bearish market sentiment coupled with lower export data,
expected to be released by SGS (M) Bhd today, and Pakistan's recent
suspension of foreign currency transaction would continue to exert
pressure on price movements in the near term, another dealer added.
	   May South, which began declining gradually since Monday, however
rebounded on Thursday to close RM70 higher at RM2,410 per tonne.
	   But on Friday, the contract month declined to close the week at
RM2,370 per tonne, RM85 lower than the previous week's close of
RM2,465 per tonne.
	   Another factor other than Pakistan's forex suspension that will
determine prices on the trading pit this week is the expected
announcement of May's palm oil export data by cargo surveyor SGS
(M) Sdn Bhd.
	   ``The export data is expected to be lower for May,'' a dealer
said.
	   For the week just ended, spot month June fell RM88 to RM2,342,
July was RM116 lower at RM2,314 while August ended RM92 easier at
RM2,292.
	   Open positions on Friday stood at 6,836 contracts against 7,280
contracts last Friday while weekly turnover declined to 11,461
contracts from 12,961 contracts previously.

	   ASIAGO, Italy (AP) _ After a long breakaway from the main pack,
Fabiano Fontanelli edged Paolo Bettini and Mario Scirea at the
finish of the Tour of Italy's 16th stage Monday.
	   That trio finished seven seconds ahead of a group of chasing
riders and about 12 minutes ahead of the top contenders. But
Fontanelli was in 77th place before the stage and not a threat to
the favorites for the overall title.
	   Alex Zuelle, who opened up a substantial overall lead with a
dominating time-trial performance Sunday, retained the pink jersey
heading into the toughest climbing stages.
	   Fontanelli was timed in 5 hours, 53 minutes, 53 seconds over the
227 kilometers (140.5 miles) from Udine to Asiago, into the
Dolomite mountains.

	   ATTENTION to ergonomics makes Recaro seats different from other
run-of-the-mill car seats. Jurgen Fritz, Recaro South East Asia Sdn
Bhd managing director, says Recaro's design ensures a motorist sits
properly with an emphasis on relieving the stress imposed on the
spine and muslces. `Every Recaro seat offers correct ergonomics as
well as comfort,' he says.
	   Sitting ergonomically correctly requires the upholstery to be
tailored to support the spine. Ergonomics, in fact, is the first
cornerstone in the Recaro engineering design. The seat also needs
cushioning properties to ease stress on the thighs. Seat height and
tilt should be variable, giving the occupant complete control. Side
bolsters on the seat cushion, lumbar support and backrest should be
optimally-shaped for better support.
	   Fritz says the basis of Recaro's unique construction principle
is known as the closed back shell. `This provides the base for the
ergonomically- shaped upholster. This is shaped in such a way that
your weight is evenly distributed and your muscles remain relaxed,'
he says.
	   Its second cornerstone is safety. Recaro seats have a higher
than normal backrest which provides optimum support for the entire
back. Its fully- upholstered headrest is height and tilt
adjustable, providing optimal damping of a head impact. Its back
shell is entirely enclosed for improved protection from sliding
luggage. The seat cushion is shaped with a strong cross member in
the frame to prevent submarining in the event of a front collision,
without which a person slides under the seat belt.
	   Fritz says comfort is Recaro's third engineering cornerstone.
`The design ensures reduced vibration, increased cushioning and
optimum support,' he says. Throughout the world, Recaro seats are
coveted for its upmarket appeal. `This is our fourth cornerstone -
styling,' says Fritz.
	   He says a good design always goes hand in hand with
functionality. He says the Recaro design combines stylish elegance
which blends well with the individual car's interior. `Our seats
are predominantly made painstakingly by hand. This allows all
aspects of the seat design to be meticulously prepared so that the
completed seat fits together perfectly,' says Fritz.

	   ON THE cover of this issue of Malaysian Business is an Intel
processor.
	   Not just any old processor but the first Pentium II chip for
mobile personal computers (PCs).
	   Its introduction in April is particularly meaningful to Malaysia
for two reasons: the launch was staged in Penang, and the
processors roll off Intel's manufacturing lines in Kulim, Kedah.
Another feather planted firmly in the cap of Intel Corporation's
Malaysian operations.
	   Intel Corporation is a company that excels by pursuing the
future relentlessly, yet, its past is so rich it bears repeated
mining. Its Malaysian history alone is interesting enough to fill a
book. Actually, somebody has already authored such a tome. In 1991,
Peggy Lim, a former Intel manager, came up with a 256-page
hardcover entitled Steel: From Ashes Rebuilt to Manufacturing
Excellence. The title refers to a fire that struck at the A1
assembly plant of Intel Technology Sdn Bhd - commonly known as
Intel Malaysia - in Penang in the mid-70s. The company was just in
its third year of operations on the island state. It was
potentially an insurmountable setback.
	   Then came the fightback. T-shirts bearing the slogan Intel Still
Delivers were spotted all over Penang. Intel workers worked
feverishly, some at nearby factories that had offered space,
machinery and time slots.
	   There must have been plenty of back-slapping and handshakes when
the company shipped out crucial orders on time. The rest of Intel
Malaysia's 25-year history may never reach such stirring heights,
but it is still a colourful story of adversity, drive and
achievement.
	   It all began at the start of the 70s when Intel Corporation saw
substance in the Penang leadership's vision to make the island an
Asian Silicon Valley. When assembly operations began in 1972,
several firsts were notched up. It was Intel's entry into Asia
Pacific via its first offshore assembly plant, which cost RM4
million back then. Intel Malaysia was among Penang's high-tech
pioneers, which explains why the company is invariably mentioned
whenever government leaders speak about the state's progress and
industrialisation.
	   A few years later, Intel's senior management in Santa Clara,
California, realised (but not without some persuasion) that the
Penang operations could also handle the more complex job of testing
microprocessors. That year, 1977, saw the opening of a second
building at the Bayan Lepas site.
	   Two decades on, the number of buildings swelled to 12, including
several at Intel's test and assembly facility at the Kulim
High-Tech Park. The Kulim operations are under another company,
Intel Products (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   The importance of Intel's Malaysian operations expanded
accordingly. In July 1992, Intel Malaysia's then managing director
P Y Lai sounded jubilant when he told reporters that Intel was
transferring its entire microcontroller division in the United
States to Penang. (Microcontrollers are programmed to control
specific functions in products such as automobile engines, laser
printers, disk drives and home appliances.) This was a huge step
forward for Intel Malaysia, which was expected to rake in RM1
billion in annual turnover from the move. In Lai's words, it was `a
milestone in the local electronics industry'. He, the first local
MD of an Intel foreign unit, added, `This is probably the first
time in Malaysia that a multinational is giving its offshore plant
the total responsibility of handling the design, manufacturing and
worldwide marketing of an important product.' And when Intel
decided it was time to have a presence in China, who did it call?
Intel Malaysia, according to an August 1992 news report. It quoted
Lai as saying the headquarters directed the Malaysian subsidiary to
negotiate with Chinese authorities on investing in the
semi-conductor industry there.
	   Today, Intel Malaysia and Intel Products' operations extend
beyond testing and assembling Intel's most advanced
microprocessors. The Penang plant has a packaging technology
development lab and a design centre. In 1994, Intel transferred the
sales and marketing of its Embedded Microcontroller Division to
Penang. The Kulim plant, which opened in 1996, also churns out
computer motherboards and networking/communications boards.
	   In the mid-90s, Intel decided the time was right to have a sales
and marketing presence in Malaysia. Malaysia had the highest
consumption rate of PCs with Intel's Pentium processors. A
representative office was opened in Kuala Lumpur in December 1995.
	   These days, the sales and marketing operations are handled by
Intel Electronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, which is headed by a country
manager. The company focuses on developing the domestic PC consumer
market, promoting Intel's brand awareness, and working with the
government and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs to help
grow the Malaysian computer market.
	   To be sure, Intel's Malaysian operations suffered other hiccups
apart from the Penang plant blaze. In the early days, pilferage was
an annoying and costly problem. That has since been remedied by
tightening security so much that even Intel boss Craig Barrett is
subjected to metal detector scans when he visits the plants.
	   In August 1992, a 19-year-old contract worker was found dead in
a liquid nitrogen filling station at the Penang facility. It was
the first work- related fatality in Intel's history. This prompted
Andrew Grove, the then Intel Corporation president, to issue on the
same day a five-page memo addressed to all employees, detailing
steps taken in the wake of the incident. Whatever measures
instituted since must have worked well, for in 1995, the Human
Resources Ministry gave Intel Malaysia a national award for
occupational safety and health.
	   Collecting awards seems to be part and parcel of Intel's
Malaysian operations. In 1990, Intel Malaysia was named the first
recipient of the Prime Minister's Quality Award. That year, it also
added to its trophy cabinet a regional award for human resources
development. The following year, it received The Intel Quality
Award, an in-house honour, true, but prestigious nevertheless given
the company's reputation for exacting standards. It has another
accolade from the Human Resources Ministry, The Caring Employer
Award, presented in 1993.
	   Indeed, Intel Malaysia is clearly run on the principle that a
happy employee is a productive employee. In 1991, for example, it
became the first manufacturer in Penang to have its own bas kilang
fleet by forking out several million ringgit to buy 230
air-conditioned coaches.
	   The company takes care not to call its workers `operators'.
According to a news article in April 1991, the term connotes a
lower standing. Instead workers who handle highly automated
machines are called technicians or computer programmers.
	   Another mark in the plus column for Intel Malaysia is its vendor
partnership programme, through which it helps develop its suppliers
through a combination of nurturing, tutoring and prodding.

	   TIN price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market is anticipated to move
in tandem with the performance of the London Metal Exchange this
week, a dealer said.
	   Demand, especially from Japanese buyers, would also determine
this week's direction for the tin market, he added.
	   Tin is anticipated to be traded between RM22.00 per kg and
RM23.50 per kg, with local, Japanese and European buyers the main
investors in the market.
	   The metal ended the week 20 sen higher at RM22.40 per kg while
weekly turnover soared to 594 tonnes against the previous week's
335 tonnes.

	   CALL IT A surreal moment. Intel Corporation president and chief
operating officer Craig R Barrett had just finished a presentation
in Penang on the chip-maker's global business strategy and was
moving around at the front of the room, speaking to journalists and
posing (a tad awkwardly) for pictures.
	   Then, he stopped walking and unconsciously stood, all 1.88m of
him, in front of a slide projector. Via a shaft of strong light, an
image was emblazoned on his white shirt. It was the company's name
in electric blue.
	   There it was, so fortuitously symbolic, no public relations
orchestration could have engineered it better - Barrett had Intel
inside! Indeed, this is the man who will soon be at the wheel of
one of the most influential forces of the global digital
revolution. Come May 20, Intel's board of directors will elect
Barrett, 58, as the company's fourth chief executive officer (CEO)
in its 30-year history. This was announced shortly before he
arrived in Penang on the night of April 1 as part of a busy swing
through five Asia-Pacific countries in as many days. He gave the
talk the morning after.
	   Letting go of the CEO title is Andrew Grove, who has promoted
`only the paranoid survive' to a management creed. As chairman,
Grove will continue to work full-time, dwelling more on `broad
strategic issues concerning the industry and Intel'. Intel's first
two CEOs were the late Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, now chairman
emeritus. The duo, together with Grove, are widely seen as Intel's
founding triumvirate. To an outsider, Grove's shoes seem impossibly
large for Barrett to fill. After all, the former is an icon of
commerce. He was Time Magazines' 1997 Man of the Year. A book,
Forbes Great Minds of Business, says he is `widely regarded as the
best corporate manager in America'. Most importantly, nobody
disputes that the highly-respected Grove has helmed Intel (and the
computer industry, to a certain extent) to a lofty position during
his 11 years as CEO. Its sales ballooned from US$ 1.9 billion in
1987 to US$ 25.1 billion last year (see chart 1).
	   Barrett too has an impressive record of his own, albeit one that
is best appreciated by people familiar with the ins and outs of
Intel. After getting his Bachelor of Science, Master of Science and
PhD degrees in material science from Stanford University, he stayed
on to teach. He was associate professor at Stanford when he left in
1974 to join Intel as technology development manager. He was named
chief operating officer in 1993. Last May, he became Intel's fourth
president.
	   Barrett is consistently singled out as the person who has
transformed Intel's manufacturing operations into a remarkably
efficient and productive machine that is the key to Intel's
dominance in the microprocessor market. But why not let the
straight-talking Grove hand out the endorsement? When announcing
the decision to make Barrett CEO, he credited Barrett as the
architect of Intel's operations throughout the last decade.
	   Analysts have given the thumbs up to the impending baton
handover, pointing out that Intel now needs an experienced
operational man as leader, someone who can slash costs in the face
of falling prices of personal computers (PCs) and chips.
	   Intel executives, Barrett included, are apt to insist that it
will be business as usual despite the leadership change. At the
same time, in an exclusive interview with Malaysian Business,
Barrett reveals an acute awareness of the urgency for Intel to
continue evolving as market conditions and the global economy
shift. Excerpts: You are among several prominent personalities in
the information technology (IT) industry who have visited this
region recently. Do you feel that Intel is spoilt for choice when
deciding on investments in the Asia-Pacific region?
	   Not necessarily. The Asia Pacific is the fastest growing region
for the PC industry and we intend to increase our presence in the
region. We are always looking at investment opportunities but there
are many factors to weigh. Malaysia is one of our choices because
we've been here for 25 years.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad was abroad when
you came here last June and during this visit as well. If you had
met him, what would you have discussed?
	   Yes, I am keen to meet him. I would like to ask him about the
progress of the Multimedia Super Corridor project. And for the
simple reason that we have a 25-year history in Malaysia, we hope
to gain some insight on long-term prospects and plans.
	   We are also interested in his views on how we can contribute,
educational initiatives regarding IT, electronic government ...
There are many things we can talk about.
	   A recurring message in your visits to the Asia-Pacific is that
developing countries need to spend between three and 3.5 per cent
of their gross domestic product (GDP) on IT to make their
businesses more competitive globally. What exactly needs to be done
and who should do it?
	   This is an observation based on the fact that the IT spending in
the United States is between three and 3.5 per cent of its GDP. The
figure in developing countries is certainly lower and should be
increased for competitiveness. If others are spending more and you
are not, you will be left behind.
	   It is a huge, complex effort. It should start with education and
be carried over into government. Big business and small business
must play a part too. The problem is some organisations are run by
gray-haired people who look like me. They tend to resist such
changes. This was the case in Europe until recently.
	   The government can help by playing a leadership role. Big
business has to be aggressive in adopting IT as a productivity
tool. If a government leader or a company president uses IT, the
rest will follow.
	   Intel's mission these days is, in your words, `to create more
new uses for PCs and find more new users for PCs', thus assuming a
leadership role to expand the industry. There doesn't seem to be
any parallel to this in other industries. Will there come a time
when Intel will feel that it is taking on too much?
	   As far as I can tell, there is no parallel to what we are doing
in the IT industry. We are spending billions on our efforts. We
have to. We are at the centre of the industry, not at its
periphery.
	   We already have almost a 90 per cent share of the market (for PC
microprocessors). We can't go much bigger than that. We have to
grow the pie.
	   Take any IT industry survey and it will show a 15 to 18 per cent
annual growth. This is a wonderful, unique industry. It is
anti-inflationary. Not many industries can match such growth. It is
a crazy industry, in a positive way, of course.
	   Industry watchers are upbeat about your impending appointment as
CEO because of your operational expertise. Although you have
already been overseeing Intel's operations for several years, will
there be big changes when you take over?
	   There will not be any revolutions. For me, regaining a strong
growth rate for Intel is most important. Historically, we were
growing between 25 and 30 per cent a year. We want to be back at
that level. (Intel's revenue grew by 20 per cent last year. Its
revenue for the first quarter of 1998 is eight per cent lower than
that of the previous quarter. This was attributed to the
unexpectedly weaker demand for its PC chips.) I also want Intel to
move aggressively into some new products and business areas, such
as networking, electronic commerce, interactive entertainment and
flash memory.
	   You have often been described as competitive. But is that the
same as paranoid? Or is there a need to be paranoid at all?
	   Of course you have to be paranoid. One has to be paranoid in the
IT industry. When you have a total turnover of your product line
every 12 months, how can you afford not to be? If we are not
paranoid, we stand to lose 90 per cent of our revenue. We like to
compete very hard.
	   Grove was quoted as saying that Noyce (Intel founding CEO)
insisted that there was a technical solution to everything, while
Grove believed in organisational or process solutions. Where do you
stand?
	   We have seen a transition in Intel's senior management from
emphasising inventing to focusing on several equally important
fronts. We progressed from a fundamentally technical venture to a
combination of strong technology, products and marketing. Over the
years, we have developed a wide-ranging approach to business with
several degrees of expertise. We invest heavily in capital,
research and development (RD) and marketing.
	   Very few companies have big budgets for all three areas. Take
Microsoft for instance. It spends a lot on RD and marketing but
its capital cost is small; it costs next to nothing to manufacture
software. (After elaborating on the different styles and strengths
of Intel's previous three CEOs) Each CEO has shaped Intel in his
own way.
	   So how do you hope to shape Intel?
	   Intel is increasingly becoming an international company. Today,
less than 50 per cent of our products are sold in the US. We need
to allocate resources to other countries to work with foreign
companies and governments. We aim to have major market presence in
these countries, not just by selling our products but also through
other aspects such as brand recognition, awareness about IT and
contributions to education and training. The other thing I would
like to be remembered for is Intel expanding into new business
areas and products.

	   THE decline in the futures market was mainly attributed to the
sell-off of the blue chips in the cash market as Asian markets
weakened further. South Korean shares slumped to an 11-year low
last week as foreign investors retreated on concerns of more
bankruptcies and worsening labour relations.
	   The week's chart has been marked with five black candles for
both the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index and the futures. Some
retracement is expected this week after this continuous fall but
the resistance at 580 seems very strong from this angle.
	   For the first week of June, some further decline to test the old
support levels of 515 and 500 for the KLCI and the June futures are
forseeable.
	   One of the items which is expected to affect the market is the
gross domestic product figures released last Saturday.
	   Other developments that might affect the market this week will
likely be fresh developments on the new political reforms in
Indonesia and worsening corporate results in the Asia Pacific
region.
	   Given the above, with continuous uncertainties looming on the
foreign front, the upside for the Malaysian market is expected to
be limited in the coming weeks.
	   Any rebound is expected to hinge on the performance of the yen
and positive news on the home front. Therefore, these should be
viewed as opportunities to short the June futures in view of the
weakening ringgit.
	   Fair value for June is 3.18 and for July is 7.59

Rosie Jones wins Rochester International 
</HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Rosie Jones reopened a four-stroke
lead, then came back to the field with back-to-back bogeys before
finally winning the rain-plagued Rochester International today.
	   Jones barely matched par on the first nine Sunday _ at which
point final-round play was halted after repeated rain delays _ but
roared back with a 35-foot (10-meter) birdie putt on No. 10 and a
12-footer (4-meter) for birdie on No. 12.
	   She dropped shots on No. 14 after getting tangled in the trees
and No. 15, where she three-putted, then steadied down to complete
an even-par round and finish at 9-under-par, or 279, at the par-72
Locust Hill course.
	   It was her ninth victory, and 126th top-10 finish, in 16 years
on tour. She took home dlrs 105,000 of dlrs 700,000 in prize money.
	   Juli Inkster vaulted into second place with a 4-under 68,
rubbing out an opening bogey on No. 14 with an 18-foot (5
1/2-meter) birdie putt on No. 16 and a 3-foot (1-meter) birdie putt
on the next hole to finish at 7-under. ``I was so wired last night,
I didn't sleep well at all,'' she said.
	   Hollis Stacy, who had halved Jones' 4-stroke lead to two on
Sunday, dropped to third place with a 70 to finish at 6-under.
Stacy, 44, captured 17 tournaments between 1977 and 1985, including
the Women's Open in 1977, 1978 and 1984. She has won just once
since then, in 1991.
	   One back were Meg Mallon, who closed with a 67, Moira Dunn and
Sherri Steinhauer.
	   The 38-year-old Jones, who won the Rochester International in
1991 and lost to Kathy Whitworth in a playoff in 1984, had opened
up a 4-stroke lead over Steinhauer on Saturday with an 8-under 64.
	   Swirling winds, flashes of lightning and heavy bouts of rain
stopped play for a total of 5 1/2 hours Sunday, eventually leading
to a postponement.
	   Defending champion Penny Hammel slumped to 4-over, one ahead of
South Korean rookie Se Ri Pak, who led the LPGA Championship from
start to finish two weeks ago.

	   INTEL Corporation's top bosses love to use a photograph taken in
Penang whenever they want to illustrate how much the Asia Pacific
has progressed since the high-tech giant first ventured into the
region.
	   Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Andrew Grove used it
last November when delivering the keynote address at the
Asia-Pacific Information Technology Summit in San Francisco. More
recently, Intel president and chief operating officer Craig R
Barrett - who will take over as CEO later this month - found the
picture just as handy for his April 2 presentation in Penang on the
company's global business strategy.
	   Taken circa 1971 when Grove was visiting the building site of
Intel's pioneer plant in Bayan Lepas, the photograph shows a
dark-haired and bespectacled version of him sporting a moustache
and sideburns. He was standing barefoot in a muddy road with his
pants rolled up to mid-calf level.
	   What happened was Grove's car had gotten stuck in the mud. He
recalled being helped by people herding water buffaloes nearby, but
to no avail. In the end, he had to walk sans shoes to the site.
Both men followed up on the first picture with a current one
showing Intel's sprawling test and assembly complex at the Bayan
Lepas Free Industrial Zone. `Things have changed a little bit since
then,' Barrett understated.
	   Intel, whose microprocessors power close to 90 per cent of the
world's personal computers (PCs), has big plans to broaden its
presence in the Asia-Pacific region. And Malaysia looks set to
benefit, thanks primarily to the company's longstanding investment
ties here.
	   It is certainly a folly to ignore the region's rapid embrace of
IT.
	   International Data Corporation, an IT market research and
consulting house, forecasts a compounded average growth rate of 12
per cent for IT spending in Asia Pacific for the period 1997 to
2002. Last year, the region's IT spending stood at US$ 50.3 billion
(US$ 1    RM3.80) and can
reach US$ 88.2 billion in the year 2002.	   In addition, the Internet explosion (Asia has the fastest
growth), the soaring investment in IT infrastructure and the
potential to become the world's PC development centre combine to
bestow Asia Pacific with an irresistible pull. A breakdown of
Intel's revenue pretty much indicates the same upward trend. In
1987, six per cent of its income came from Asia Pacific (excluding
Japan). A decade later, the proportion has swelled to 19 per cent.
Japan's contribution for both years was 10 per cent.
	   Describing Asia Pacific as a hot area for PC consumption growth,
Barrett says Intel is increasing its presence in the region not
only through manufacturing and support, but also through sales and
marketing. Of the company's total capital expenditure of US$ 4.5
billion last year, US$ 1 billion landed in Asia. On the 1998
projections, Barrett says the global investment should be about US$
5 billion, with US$ 1.3 billion targeted for Asia Pacific.
	   This year, he added, Intel would invest between US$ 400 million
and US$ 500 million in Malaysia. The amount will be spent mainly on
upgrading and expanding its test and assembly plants in Penang and
Kulim, Kedah, and on an integrated warehouse at the Penang airport.
	   Barrett reckons that among electronics players, his company is
the number one investor in Malaysia in 1998. To date, Intel has
spent US$ 1.2 billion on capital investment here. This has fuelled
expansion of its Malaysian manufacturing operations over 25 years
to now include a dozen industrial buildings in Penang and Kulim in
which workers test and assemble microprocessors and a few other
computer components. Research and development (RD) activities are
focused on design and packaging technology. Some 7,000 workers are
employed at the plants.
	   Intel's sales and marketing operations in Malaysia started in
1995 when it opened a representative office. A current focus is to
drum up business by promoting wider IT use among small and
medium-scale industries. Another measure to increase sales is to
aggressively reduce prices.
	   It is only to be expected that Intel has signed up for a slot in
the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. It was reported in
February that Barrett had been named a member of the MSC's
International Advisory Panel.
	   He says, `We are still looking at options for being a part of
the MSC, and what makes maximum sense with our partners in this
area. We are definitely committed to having a presence there.
Perhaps, it will be in the form of a stand-alone RD facility.'
Intel's MSC-status company is registered as Intel Malaysia Design
Centre MSC Sdn Bhd. Intel Technology Sdn Bhd's (also referred to as
Intel Malaysia's) managing director Wong Siew Hai says the idea was
to set up a development centre, only that it had not been decided
what exactly would be developed. A full-time manager is working on
the venture.
	   Intel's push in Asia Pacific is not just about pouring in money.
Barrett demonstrated this with frequent trips to the region that
often include chats with government and industry leaders to propel
Intel's `New Users, New Uses' drive. The aim is to encourage people
to turn to IT and to nurture the creation of IT tools. More
computers sold equates more Intel chips sold.
	   Barrett's latest Asian tour was his third in less than a year.
Between March 30 and April 3, his whistlestops also included South
Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia. `IT is the key to
competitiveness in the future. That's not a terribly hard sell. If
you come to a place like Malaysia, you don't have to talk very hard
to the government to convince it that an IT infrastructure is very
important, with the MSC and other IT projects the Malaysian
government has underway,' says Barrett, adding that South Korea and
the Philippines too have similar initiatives.
	   `So every country is, in fact, looking for opportunities to
create a strong infrastructure in IT. And I don't think they're
necessarily competing. I think they're very complementary in many
instances because one of the ways to create a strong local
infrastructure is to have the capability for both hardware and
software development in your country.' Despite these reassuring
words, the competition for foreign IT investment remains a sweaty,
high-stakes battle; the neighbours are equally eager to reap
Intel's dollars and knowhow. It was recently reported that Thailand
had persuaded Intel to provide technology to kickstart its Software
Park. There have also been reports that South Korea was
anticipating Intel to invest in a big way. Perhaps, the most
telling development came in the Down Under leg of his last Asian
tour. There, he met Prime Minister John Howard and senior ministers
reportedly to work out a financial package that might get Intel to
set up a wafer fabrication plant (or fab in industry jargon) in
Australia.
	   Such an investment is said to be worth up to A$6 billion (A$1   
RM2.50).	   Some reports characterised the meeting as something of a hard
bargaining session. `If you want to put a fab in Malaysia, you
would probably get a 10-year tax holiday,' the Australian Financial
Review quoted Barrett as saying. The question of Intel investing in
a fab in Malaysia has come up before. Wong says it is a `totally
different ball game'. He explains that fab operations have
stringent and critical infrastructural needs, including water, gas
and electricity. `With a few fabs set to operate in the Kulim
Hi-Tech Park, hopefully it can be demonstrated that Malaysia has
the capabilities to support such operations,' he adds.
	   In arriving at its upbeat outlook on the Asia-Pacific region,
Intel has not overlooked the Asian economic gloom. It is simply
that the company is often guided by the philosophy of co-founder
and chairman emeritus Gordon Moore. Barrett cites an oft-repeated
Moore dictum: `You can never recover from a recession on the basis
of the products you had when the recession started. You can only
pull out of the recession on the basis of new products.' Says
Barrett, `So if there is one message I would like to give the
industries, governments and people of Southeast Asia during this
crisis is that this is the time - probably the most important time
- to invest and move forward.'

Hall to step down as Newcastle chairman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle United announced Monday Sir
John Hall would step down as chairman, his caretaker stint complete
following the controversial resignations two months ago of Freddy
Shepherd and Douglas Hall.
	   Sir John's departure follows last week's boardroom shake-up at
parent company Newcastle United PLC when chairman Sir Terence
Harrison and non-executive director John Mayo quit.
	   In a statement, the company said it would ``consider the
structure and complement of both the PLC and the football club
boards immediately after'' new appointments were in place.
	   Former chairman Shepherd and vice-chairman Douglas Hall quit in
disgrace in the wake of well documented allegations that the pair
made derogatory comments about the club's fans, Newcastle women,
England skipper Alan Shearer and manager Kenny Dalglish.
	   Sir John was subsequently recalled as chairman to stabilize the
club but marked his return by defending his son and Shepherd for
the contribution they had made to reviving Newcastle's fortunes.
	   Those remarks sparked fears among fans that Shepherd and Douglas
Hall would eventually return to the Newcastle boardroom. Sir John's
decision to step down could heighten speculation the pair will soon
be back on the board.

	   SOME LIKE it hot, some like it cold. Whichever way you like your
tea, you'll be sure to enjoy your cuppa at the Ummph! Tea Shop
located in Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur.
	   Here at Ummph!, there are a variety of teas, from gourmet teas
to herbal blends, from pure garden teas to exotic spiced blends,
and not forgetting the really cooling thirst quenching iced teas.
The brainchild of Caroline Russel, Ummph! was set up over a year
ago, and also serves a wide range of sandwiches, cakes, pastas as
well as popular local fare.
	   Says marketing manager Christopher S Thiagarajah, `Customers
walk in for light lunches, snacks, tea-time, and even supper.'
According to Thiagarajah, Ummph! is modelled after the United
States's Starbuck, which contemporises coffee drinking. 'Basically,
we want to contemporise tea drinking, especially among the younger
generation which is our target market. We are, in fact, turning a
new leaf or rather stirring the tea leaves among the young ones.
They should feel that it is stylish and trendy to drink tea like
the iced teas rather than Coke or Pepsi. At the same time, they
want to be seen at Ummph! because it's the place to be,' he adds.
	   Boh's iced teas offer a refreshing alternative to quench your
thirst.
	   Lemon Lime has a natural, zesty tang and Peach is delicately
fragrant and sweet, while Orchard Splash is an invigorating blend
of fresh green guava, ripe mango, orange juice and a sharp dash of
tangerine.
	   For lovers of specialty teas, there are many flavours to choose
from - Darjeeling, Lapsang Souchong, Tippy Assam, Kenya, Java and
Ceylon.
	   Thiagarajah explains that these teas come from world-renowned
tea growing regions. Each tea is distinguished by its own special
character: champagne Darjeeling, smoky Lapsang Souchong, malty
Assam, sparkling Kenya, fragrant Java and mellow Ceylon. They are
sold in tea leaf packs as well as teabags.
	   Among the more popular ones are teas from the Seri Songket
range, says Thiagarajah. They are also sought after as gifts or
souvenirs by tourists because of the attractive Songket design
packaging. Seri Songket boasts flavours like passion fruit, earl
grey with tangerine, lemon with mandarin, lychee with rose, lime
and ginger and mango in its teabag presentations. Then you have
vanilla, cinnamon, clove and cardamon, earl grey with tangerine and
lemon with mandarin. Seri Songket's earl grey with tangerine, says
Thiagarajah, is special in a way because of its tangerine flavour,
and therefore, has an edge over other earl greys. It is among
Ummph!'s best sellers.
	   The exotic and beguiling Seri Songket flavoured teas, apart from
being named after the exquisite gold-woven songket fabric, are in
fact, a precious blend of Boh's light Sungei Palas teas.
	   For those who have developed a taste for herb infusions, calming
Camomile and spirited Peppermint are just two of the most widely
enjoyed therapeutic herbal teas. Boh has them made from the best
flowers and leaves and they are naturally caffeine- as well as
calorie-free. These are available in teabags.
	   Fruit infusions offers passion fruit orange, peach apricot and
strawberry raspberry. Perfect hot or iced, these are delightful
blends of dried fruit, flowers and peel blended with fragrant
natural essences. They are free from caffeine, artificial
preservatives or artificial colouring.
	   Tea drinkers will, in the near future, be able to sit down with
their favourite drink accompanied with a plate of savouries or a
piece of cake at other Ummph! shops as there are plans for more
outlets. `We are pleased with the response to our tea shop which
shows that ``Boh ada ummph''. In whatever we do, we certainly do
not want to loose track of our origin and heritage - Cameron
Highlands,' he says.

	   Accused killer and drug trafficker Jose Luis Lopez, alias ``El
Tamaulipeco,'' was handed over to Mexican authorities by U.S.
authorities in the border city of Hidalgo, Coahuila, official news
agency Notimex reported Sunday.
	   Lopez is wanted by two Federal District judges on organized
crime and murder charges. He is also wanted by judges in the
Pacific Coast states of Michoacan and Oaxaca and by a city judge in
Guadalajara involving murder and organized crime charges. In
concordance with the Mexico-U.S. extradition treaty, Lopez's
extradition is being handled by the Foreign Relations Secretariat,
a federal agency, and not state or city departments. Lopez and two
accused accomplices are required to make declarations before the
two Federal District judges, Cruz Lilia Romero Ramirez and Patricia
Gudino Rodriguez on murder, assault and battery and organized crime
charges.
	   The Mexico City Attorney General's Office (PGJDF) said the
42-year-old Lopez is originally from Nuevo Laredo, Tamps, the
Mexican city directly opposite Laredo, Texas, on the Mexico-U.S.
	   border. The PGJDF reported Lopez had served three years in a
prison in Huntsville, Texas, for attempted murder of his wife.
	   Lopez was handed over by Texas police at the city gate of
Hidalgo, Coahuila, a border town that lies across the Rio Grande
from Texas and which lies very close to Nuevo Laredo. Judicial
police from Mexico City and Tamaulipas took him into immediate
custody.
	   Lopez currently is imprisoned in Mexico City's Northern
Penitentiary.

EDS: CLARIFIES 4th graf to show walkout biggest in 27 years IF it

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of frustrated passengers were stranded at
airports across the country Monday, after Air France pilots began a
strike that threatened to disrupt travel plans during the World
Cup.
	   Monitors at Paris' main airports offered a bleak sight for
passengers: departure screens flashing ``annule'' and ``canceled''
in bright red letters next to nearly all Air France flights nine
days before the soccer championship begins.
	   The jets of the official airline for the World Cup, many
decorated with players representing the 32 teams, sat idle at
terminals. Their 3,200 pilots sought to block wage cuts aimed at
keeping the newly profitable state-owned airline out of the red.
	   The walkout would be Air France's biggest in 27 years if it
lasts the 15 days striking pilots have threatened, and was a
serious embarrassment to the leftist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   Frustrated passengers lined up at Air France ticket counters at
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, hoping to switch their tickets
to other carriers.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation to Senegal, said
it wasn't fair the pilots were striking ahead of the World Cup,
being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone, it's too
bad. That's not the image of France, it should be avoided. You can
say they are not civic-minded,'' he said.
	   Yelena Panteley, a Russian student from California, was on her
way to see her mother in Saint Petersburg, hoping to catch an
alternate flight. ``There is hope, but nothing's sure.''
	   However, some airports, like those in Lyon and Marseille, were
almost deserted. Passengers warned in advance of the strike stayed
away.

Russian markets fall despite U.S. support percent, edits to trim. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with stocks falling more than 10
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks fell more than 10 percent Monday,
despite new government efforts to sooth jittery investors and U.S.
promises to support new loans by international lenders.
	   The Russian Trading System closed down 10.2 percent, after
Russian banks continued their frantic selling and western investors
stayed away from trading.
	   The market has fallen 44 percent since the beginning of May, and
there are fears of further losses before calm is restored. The
Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and tripled a key
interest rates to 150 percent to persuade investors to stay in
Russia.
	   In a brief statement issued Sunday, President Bill Clinton
expressed U.S. support for aid to Russia from such multinational
institutions as the World Bank and the IMF.
	   On Monday, Russia's new tax chief stressed the government has
enough cash reserves to protect the ruble against devaluation, but
said additional help from the International Monetary Fund would
help calm investors shaken by last week's wave of panic selling
that caused the market to plummet.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday, said another dlrs 5 billion would be enough.
	   Before the crisis, Russia's economic prospects had been looking
somewhat brighter, with the government having kept a lid on
inflation and recording its first economic growth since the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   But the government has been unable to solve a years-long
payments crisis, caused by its inability to collect taxes and
therefore to pay wages to state workers. Many workers and
pensioners have been unpaid for months.
	   Fyodorov said in an earlier television interview that the
country's 35 percent tax rate must be lowered but enforcement
strengthened.
	   ``The rate should be 20 percent, but then those who do not pay
must in effect be put into prison,'' he told the NTV network.
	   Russian leaders have said that the economic crisis was triggered
by a combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices
for gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.
	   In a move to ease the crisis, IMF officials said Friday that
they will recommend releasing a delayed payment of dlrs 700
million, the latest installment of an existing dlrs 10 billion
loan.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, moving to cut government
spending, Monday ordered a 30 percent reduction in Cabinet
personnel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Cabinet staffing will be
cut from 1,450 people to 1,015, the report said.

	   THE 7-Eleven stores are the first convenience stores to provide
full-service automated financial services to consumers in Austin,
Texas (United States).
	   The Southland Corporation (which operates, franchises and
licenses approximately 17,200 7-Eleven stores worldwide) and NCR
Corporation recently unveiled a state-of-the-arts financial service
centre which will use NCR's personaS Self-Service solutions
technology to provide various services like cheque cashing, bill
payments, money transfers, money orders and phone card purchases.
Sophisticated call centre technology provides remote operator
assistance to help manage advanced financial transactions and
answer consumer questions.
	   `Like consumers around the globe, 7-Eleven customers are
demanding greater access to a wide variety of services,' said Clark
Matthews, president and CEO of The Southland Corporation. NCR's
products, Matthews believes, will help his company deliver these
services conveniently and consistently.
	   Working with Southland, Western Union and Affiliated Computer
Services (ACS), NCR designed, developed and tested the complete
kiosk solution, including applications, integrated terminal
hardware devices and networking connections to the on-line systems
at ACS. NCR personaS 40 mini ATM and Kiosk terminals support an
array of technology such as document scanning, cash acceptance,
specialised printers for money orders and phone cards, check image
processing and coin dispensing.

	   CONTINUING weakness on the regional equities and currency
markets caused price trends on the local bourse to slip further on
lack of fresh leads on the local front.
	   Comments by economists and analysts that the country's economic
growth was worse than forecast earlier depressed share prices even
further.
	   Last week, the KLSE Composite Index fell 38.99 points, or 6.76
per cent, when compared to the previous week's close of 577.23
level. The KLSE All Share EMAS Index (KLSE EMAS) closed 8.41
points, or 5.80 per cent, lower to 136.51 level. Thus, the KLSE
EMAS had out-performed the KLSE CI by 96 basis points. The
out-performance posted by the KLSE EMAS was due primarily to many
second and third liners' retracement to the 1990/1991 levels.
	   Many of these second and third liners had since breached the
RM1.00 level while some had even dropped below the 50 sen support
level. Granite Industries Bhd (Granite) is one such counter that
fell from grace.
	   Granite was one of the stock market darlings during the 1993
superbull run. Its price trend rose from its intra-year low of
RM1.08 on Jan 5, 1993 to its all-time high of RM16.60 on Dec 12,
1993, posting a whopping gain of RM15.52, or 1,437.04 per cent,
over a 12-month period. Since then, its price trend had collapsed
down to its recent low of 44.5 sen level on May 14, 1998. The
company was formed on Dec 31, 1968 as a joint venture between Chee
Tat Realty Private Ltd, a company incorporated in Singapore and
Castle  Cooke Inc of Hawaii, USA.
	   Since then, the major shareholdings had changed hands several
times.
	   After several changes, Tan Sri Datuk Ting Pek Khiing emerged as
the single largest shareholder with direct and indirect interest of
26.13 and 9.91 per cent respectively on May 2, 1996.
	   Granite is principally an investment holding company with
subsidiaries involved in timber moulding and related activities,
operation of hotels, general trading, property development, supply
of machines and provision of services in the leisure and
entertainment industry.
	   On May 6, 1997, the company had entered into subscription
agreements to acquire 99.99 per cent stakes in Langkasuka Resorts
Sdn Bhd, Aquabeat Langkawi Sdn Bhd and Langkawi Exhibition Hall Sdn
Bhd for a total consideration of RM176.6 million. A proposed
5-for-3 rights issue was supposed to raise the necessary funding
but the proposed acquisition was called off in October 1997.
	   Chartwise, Granite's price trend peaked at RM16.60 level on Dec
22, 1993. Since then, its price trend continued to drift lower and
lower when the corporate activities shifted to timber and operation
of hotels.
	   Its price trend hit its recent retracement low of 44.5 sen on
May 14, 1998, giving a total retracement loss of RM16.155, or 97.32
per cent, from its all-time historical high of RM16.60 level.
	   Here are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
Moving Averages: Its price trend continued to stay below all its
10-, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.
	   Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index encountered
resistance at its neutral reference line.
	   On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend continued to stay
below its 10-day exponential moving averages.
	   Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI rebounded on the strength of
its positive divergence to that of the price trend.
	   OUTLOOK: Granite's diversification into the timber and
hospitality industry yielded steady return to profitability. Its
further diversification into the hospitality industry was hampered
by the current economic and financial turmoil.
	   From its substantial shareholders' filings of Form 29B on May
20, 1998, it was noted that See Hoy Chan Properties Sdn Bhd and
associates had been steadily building up their holdings in Granite
to 17.532 million shares.
	   Is it purely for investment purposes?
	   Technically, Granite's price trend has since retraced to its new
low since 1989. Certainly, its current levels have minimal downside
risks as its all-time historical low was at 35 sen level.
Currently, its price trend remains around its current level (See
Granite's weekly bar chart - E1-E2).
	   From its daily bar chart, Granite's price trend is likely to
move out of its short-term downtrend (F3-F4) on its sideway course.
Once it moves out of its short-term downtrend, Granite's price
trend is likely to initiate a technical rebound to re-challenge its
next overhead resistance (F1-F2) over its intermediate-term
perspectives.

Westwood holds off Clarke by a stroke to win TPC of Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALVESLOHE, Germany (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood Monday needed a
20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to end Darren Clarke's late
charge and capture his second title of the year at the TPC of
Europe.
	   Westwood, the 25-year-old Ryder Cup player, fired a 66 and
23-under 265 to stave off Clarke's challenge by a shot after
letting a four-stroke lead melt away at the dlrs 1.9 million
tournament.
	   Clarke charged by stringing together four birdies on his last
five holes, before Westwood shook off his first bogey of the day on
the 16th with the clutch putt.
	   ``I finally closed the door, so it's the biggest birdie of the
week,'' said Westwood. ``It's difficult when a player like Clarke
is chasing you. He can birdie every hole.''
	   Clarke, of Northern Ireland, finished with a 4-under 68 and 266
while Masters champion Mark O'Meara was third at 269 and a final
round 70.
	   The American, playing his first European tournament since
winning at Augusta, also chased Clarke but shot himself out of
contention with a double bogey on the 11th hole.
	   Westwood's title was his first in Europe this season, having
earlier won on the other side of the Atlantic at the Freeport
McDermott Classic held in New Orleans.
	   Fighting a steady wind, Westwood's 6-under 66 came after he
fired a course record Sunday with 61.
	   ``It's the first time I've ever done that _ hopefully it's not
the last,'' said Westwood of the two low rounds.
	   Bernhard Langer finished with a 68 and 271, along with Ireland's
Philip Walton. The German, a two-time winner of the tournament,
also dropped out of contention with a double bogey on his second
hole.
	   ``You just want to stick your head in the sand _ I'm very happy
with my round after that,'' said Langer, still searching for his
first title this season.
	   The scores, although low, were nothing compared to Sunday's
third round when Westwood shattered the course record and O'Meara
matched it.
	   ``I'm surprised the scores weren't better. Maybe we used up all
the birdies yesterday,'' said Walton, whose fourth-place finish
came after he missed five straight cuts.

Romania sets sights on semi-finals 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAFTICA, Romania (AP) _ Romania's soccer team hopes to make it
into the semi-finals of this summer's World Cup in France, topping
its performance of four years ago, when it fell in the
quarter-finals.
	   ``We might qualify for semi-finals if we play well,'' said
Gheorghe Popescu, a key part of Romania's defense, who plays
professionally for Turkey's champion Galatasaray.
	   His teammate with Galatasaray, Gheorghe Hagi, known as ``the
Maradona of the Carpathians,'' said Romania's most difficult game
would be its first one, June 15 against Colombia.
	   Although Romania beat Colombia in 1994 play, the first match is
often the toughest psychologically.
	   Dan Petrescu, a player for England's Chelsea, said Romania's
tournament strategy will depend on whether the team beats Colombia.
	   Romania plays in Group G, along with Colombia, England and
Tunisia. Romania and England are considered the front-runners.
	   Romania scored nine victories and one draw qualifying for the
World Cup.
	   The team achieved its best showing in the 1994 World Cup,
beating Colombia and the United States in the first round, and even
Argentina in a wild second-round match. Romania later fell to
Sweden in the quarter-finals.
	   The national team currently trains at their base of Saftica, 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Bucharest.
	   Coach Anghel Iordanescu is expected to announce the line-up for
the World Cup soon. Romania will have two warm-up games, with
Paraguay and Moldova, before leaving June 8 for France.

	   THE greenback ended stronger against the ringgit last week after
a top Malaysian official warned that the economy could go into a
recession if the tight monetary policy persisted. Ahead of the
economy's first quarter results, traders were not willing to take
positions. The greenback closed at 3.8300 on Friday, from 3.7200
the week before.
	   THE Sing dollar also weakened against the dollar last week on
news that the Singapore economy could need some stimulation soon.
But the Sing ended the week higher against the ringgit, ahead of
the release of Malaysia's first quarter growth figure. The Sing
closed at 2.2810 last Friday, from 2.2710 the week before.
	   EVEN though the Japanese yen weakened to a new low against the
greenback, it was largely unchanged against the ringgit last week.
This is because both currencies weakened together. With prospects
looking dim, the yen should dip further in the weeks ahead. The yen
ended last week at 2.7540, from 2.7470 the week before.
	   STERLING benefited from the weaker ringgit last week. There were
no major UK indicators released last week. Only the uncertainties
in Russia swayed sterling against the mark. This week, sterling
could react to the central bank's policy meeting. Sterling closed
Friday at 6.2300, up 6.0590 the week before.
	   THE Aussie dollar rebounded from its recent lows against the
ringgit.
	   News that the Aussie economy registered its fifth straight trade
deficit in April had no effect. The Aussie closed last Friday at
2.3700, up from 2.3450 the week before.

	   MAIN board-listed Arus Murni Corporation Bhd (AMCB) is doing a
volteface, both in terms of strategy and shareholders.
	   Jettisoning finance, the company is pole-vaulting into property.
	   Specifically, AMCB is selling its crown jewel, finance company
Kewangan Bersatu Bhd (KBB), to Hong Leong Finance Bhd. The sale, of
course, was in line with Bank Negara's drive to pare Malaysia's 39
finance companies down to eight. At the time of writing, details on
price and mode of payment were not available. As of last month,
Hong Leong Bank, Hong Leong Finance's parent company, was still
conducting a due diligence audit on KBB.
	   However, would AMCB prefer cash or something else? Probably
cash, if its proposed property purchases get approved by the
authorities and AMCB shareholders. In February, AMCB announced a
series of acquisitions that would probably replace the lost income
streams from KBB. These acquisitions will be paid in cash. Notably,
AMCB will be buying a slew of Singaporean and Malaysian property
companies from parties acting in concert with Singaporean property
tycoon Eric Tan Eng Huat, also dubbed the Geylang King for his
lucrative forays into the republic's property market.
	   Torie International Pte Ltd (TIPL), which is controlled by Tan,
will emerge as a substantial shareholder in AMCB. AMCB's
controlling shareholder, Arus Murni Sdn Bhd - which is helmed by
former Idris Hydraulic company secretary Mohd Faiz Abdullah - will
sell 37.64 million AMCB shares and 9.41 million AMCB warrants. In
toto, these constitute 22 per cent of total AMCB shares in issue
and 16 per cent of warrants outstanding as at Feb 6, 1998. However,
no mention was made of the quantum or mode of payment in the
proposal. At the current price of 87.5 sen per AMCB share and 31
sen per warrant, the stake would cost TIPL RM35.9 million or about
S$15 million - pretty cheap entree for Tan into the KLSE.
	   Is AMCB getting a good deal? Overall, it seems the pre-tax
profit would get a boost. For the half year ended June 30, 1997,
AMCB suffered a group pre-tax loss of RM11.1 million on the back of
interest income of RM116.98 million. Loss per share was 8.6 sen
against earnings per share of 1.64 sen during the previous period.
At the same time, cash reserves might be eroded and leveraging may
rise.
	   All in all, AMCB will fork out an aggregate cash consideration
of RM117.4 million for the proposed Singapore acquisitions and
RM289.7 million for the proposed Malaysian acquisitions. Properties
were valued according to open market valuations as of different
dates and using different methods by independent valuers. According
to the proposal, the acquisitions are expected to be financed by
the disposal of KBB, internal funds and bank borrowings.
	   At the same time, net tangible asset per share of AMCB will
decrease from RM1.79 to RM1.33. However, this is prior to the
disposal of KBB. NTA post-KBB sale was not quantified because `the
disposal consideration has not been determined at this juncture.'
But, optimistically, earnings per share won't be diluted due to an
increase in paid-up since no new shares are being issued.
	   What was the rationale behind the proposed acquisitions? On one
hand, the Singapore properties will enable AMCB to earn foreign
exchange, a crucial consideration in the light of the ringgit's
recent vagaries. The properties in Singapore comprise mainly
completed residential and commercial units. Of course, points out a
Singaporean observer, `The Singaporean property market hasn't been
too healthy lately, so demand for the AMCB properties may not be
that stunning.' The Malaysian properties comprise commercial,
industrial, residential and recreational properties, located in
mainly Johor Baru, with the balance in central Malacca and Ipoh.
AMCB's Johor Baru jewel - the JB Waterfront City, a `self-contained
metropolis to be built on a ``above-the- water'' concept on the
Straits of Johor. Started in April 1997 and poised for completion
by December 2000, assuming no hitches, this `Waterfront' will be
Johor's new central business district.
	   To safeguard its interests, AMCB will be getting a profit
guarantee for the property companies. The vendors of the Malaysian
property companies have guaranteed profit before tax of RM18 and
RM21 million for the first and second calendar year respectively,
starting from the completion date of the proposed restructuring.
Likewise, the vendors of the Singapore property companies shall
guarantee a profit before taxation for the first year of RM17
million and the second year of RM14 million. The guarantee ensures
that the group's profit before taxation will not be less than RM35
million per annum for the two calendar years commencing from
completion of restructuring.
	   Discounting the profit guarantee, the Singaporean companies
should be profitable based on their track record. Profit after tax
and minority interests for the companies was S$13.72 million for
the period from July 1, 1996 until Sept 30 1997 as compared to
S$3.57 million for the period from July 1, 1995 till June 30, 1996.

Brazil's food and crop situation critical, U.N. agency says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Up to 10 million people in northeastern Brazil could
go hungry this year because of one of the worst droughts in 15
years, a U.N. agency reported Monday.
	   It said grain output will be half of normal and plantings of
some crops have been cut up to 90 percent in some areas.
	   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said up to 4.8
million people might starve.
	   Half the land in the region, which has had no rain in six
months, is a virtual desert, the FAO said, and the situation might
worsen if the drought continues through December, as forecasts say.
	   Grain production in the region is expected to reach just 4.5
tons, half the normal production, the FAO said.
	   Plantings of rice and beans, staples of the local diet, have
been cut sharply, in some locations by as much as 80 percent. Maize
plantings are down 60 percent to 90 percent in some areas, and
other crops, like coffee and sugar cane, are also severely
affected.
	   Although droughts are not unusual in the northeast, experts say
El Nino has exacerbated the situation.

	   SPARE a thought for our disabled brethren and emulate the
example of AMIM Holdings Sdn Bhd, the assembler and distributor of
Ford vehicles in Malaysia. It has introduced the Ford Disabled
Package to help people with special needs to become more
independent. AMIM Holdings general manager Richard Canny says the
package is specifically designed for the Laser Lynx and is fitted
free of charge to any certified disabled buyer with a valid
Malaysian driving licence. A group of disabled drivers from the
Damai Disabled Training Centre in Petaling Jaya was given the
opportunity to test drive a Ford Lynx fitted with the package
recently. 'Ford believes the disabled should be assisted to be as
mobile and independent as everybody else - whether to explore this
beautiful country, drive themselves to town to do some shopping or
simply visit friends and family without having to arrange for
transportation assistance,' says Canny.

	   LAST week share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed
broadly lower with movements confined within the support and
resistance ranges on lack of fresh leads.
	   The KLSE Composite Index staged several re-tests of its 544
support but gave way in the afternoon trades on May 29, this year.
The relatively thin market volume reflected investors' current
stand of sidelining their trading activities.
	   On May 25 the KLSE CI opened on a weak note as investors felt
there were no fresh incentives to enter the market. On the regional
front, investors would like to see more stability before returning
to the market. The KLSE CI closed 6.68 points lower to 570.55
level.
	   Renewed weakness on the regional equities markets dampened
market sentiment on the domestic front. It was also affected by
news that the gross domestic product growth for the first quarter
of this year was not very encouraging.
	   Given the bearish influences on both the domestic and regional
front, the KLSE CI drifted lower to 561.34 level on May 26, 1998,
giving a loss of 9.21 points, or 1.61 per cent.
	   The KLSE CI drifted even lower on May 27 on weakness of Japanese
Yen.
	   The wide fluctuations on the New York stock market was another
contributing factor in dampening market sentiment on the local
bourse. The KLSE CI closed 9.06 points, or 1.61 per cent, lower to
552.28 level.
	   Overall market drifted lower on May 28 on continuing negative
perception of the local and regional front. Economists and analysts
were further concerned by the prospect of lower economic growth
this year than forecasted earlier. The KLSE CI dropped another 7.54
points, or 1.37 per cent, to 544.74 level.
	   The KLSE CI's technical rebound to 549.94 in the morning trades
on May 29 soon fizzled out as sellers took the opportunity to
liquidate. The overall market sentiment was still fragile when most
stocks gave up their early morning gains. It closed at the week's
lowest level at 538.24 level.
	   Reflecting the continuing weak market sentiment, the KLSE CI
fell 38.99 points, or 6.76 per cent, over the week to close at its
lowest level at 538.24 points on May 29. The KLSE All Share EMAS
Index dropped 8.41 points, or 5.80 per cent, to 136.51 level.
	   The KLSE Industrial Index lost 69.23 points, or 6.27 per cent,
to 1,035.40 level. The KLSE Second Board Index declined 4.69
points, or 4.04 per cent, to 111.47 level.
	   Chartwise, the KLSE CI traced out five consecutive trading days'
losses of 38.99 points, or 6.76 per cent. It had given up all its
gains registered during the previous week's technical rebound to
596.09 level on May 21. Since then, it was almost a straight line
decline.
	   Following are the readings of some of its technical
indicators:-Moving Averages: The KLSE CI continued to stay below
all its 10-, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.
	   Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index failed in its
attempt on May 27 to overcome its resistance at the zero reference
line.
	   On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend had since turned
down below its 10-day exponential moving averages.
	   Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI had since reversed from its
recent peak at 46.01 level on May 21 to 31.77 level on May 29
OUTLOOK: Overall market had since weakened further on lack of fresh
leads from both the domestic and regional front. Renewed weakness
on the regional bourses coupled with the uncertainties of the
regional currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen, dampened the
market sentiment further.
	   The KLSE CI fell below this column's envisaged support levels.
It even breached the clustered support at 544 level before moving
lower to close at 538.24 points on May 29.
	   Following the KLSE CI's breakdown below the 544 support level,
the KLSE CI has tentatively resumed its downside consolidation. A
stay below the 544 level on June 1 shall confirm the resumption of
its correction from 764.94 level. How far will this downside
consolidation be?
	   Trying to find an insight into the current downside
consolidation, we have to revert to the KLSE CI's other phases of
uptrend and downtrend to locate the likely symmetry waves. With
that, we shall try to pin down the next set of symmetry wave in
determining the current retracement support.
	   The technical rebound from 470 level on Jan 12 to 764 level on
Feb 11 gave a retracement gain of 294 points. This corresponded to
the uptrend gain of 294 points, from 176 level in May 1986 to 470
level in August 1987. Thereafter, its price trend retraced from 470
level to 223 level in December 1987, giving a retracement loss of
247 points, or 84 per cent.
	   Should the 84 per cent retracement (247 points) be the next set
of symmetry wave, then the KLSE CI's current retracement will
likely to find critical support at 517 level.
	   Other Fibonacci-based ratio retracement from its recent
movements placed its clustered support around 510 to 517 levels.
Thus, the next downside critical support is at 511 to 517 levels
while its immediate overhead resistance is now at 544 level.

Hoddle says he dropped Gascoigne solely for lack of fitness Gascoigne; adds more Hoddle quotes; edits

Eds: ADDS bookmakers odds; bookmakers says team better without
<TEXT>
	   LA MANGA, Spain (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle said Monday he
dropped controversial midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the final
22-man World Cup team solely because he wasn't fit.
	   On Sunday, Hoddle stunned England by dropping the 31-year-old
Gascoigne, rated by some as the best midfielder in English history.
	   As well as Gascoigne, Hoddle also dropped five other players _
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, Manchester United's Phil Neville
and Nicky Butt, Coventry's Dion Dublin and Everton's Andy
Hinchcliffe _ to get down to the final 22-man team.
	   But all attention Monday focused on Gascoigne, a highly skilled,
creative player who has filled the tabloid press in recent years
with reports of his fast-paced, hard-drinking life off the pitch.
	   ``He (Gascoigne) was not selected on his fitness levels and his
form over the last two or three months,'' said Hoddle, speaking at
a news conference in this southeastern Spanish resort where England
has been training.
	   ``We have run out of time getting him to the (fitness) levels I
needed,'' Hoddle added. ``I am as disappointed as Paul that he is
not with us but I have had to make a very tough decision. It was a
difficult one for me to call.''
	   Hoddle, looking composed in the face of a decision that could
backfire, recounted that Gascoigne cried after he told him the
news.
	   ``We had a chat for two or three minutes that lasted no longer
than that,'' Hoddle said. ``At the end of the day I think there
were some tears in his eyes.''
	   ``He went into his room. I think some of his friends went into
his room to console him. Paul acted as I would have expected him to
react.''
	   Britain's biggest bookmakers Ladbrokes last week lengthened the
odds on England winning the World Cup from 7-1 to 8-1 following
poor play in three matches.
	   The odds remained unchanged with Gascoigne's departure _ and
could shorten.
	   ``We believe the team is better off without Gascoigne,'' said
Ladbrokes' spokesman Sean Boyce. ``We take the attitude this is a
good thing.''
	   Gascoigne, a key figure when England reached the World Cup
semifinals in 1990 in Italy, returned to England after the shock
announcement and was reported staying with his estranged wife
Sheryl.
	   ``I can't believe this has happened. This is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me,'' The Sun newspaper quoted Gascoigne
as saying.
	   The unexpected gamble by Hoddle, the No. 1 news item Monday
across England, was surprisingly supported by more than 75 percent
of callers to a popular London morning radio show.
	   ``We've played him before when he's not been 100-percent fit,
but that's been in a one-off situation, Hoddle said.
	   ``This is different, this is going up against the best players
in the world and he just wasn't ready for it.''
	   ``I needed to have 22 players who I knew could last 90 minutes,
and Paul just didn't come into that category. The pace of the
modern game means you have to have athletes, not just technically
excellent players, but athletes as well.
	   Gascoigne, who has played for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio,
Glasgow Rangers and Middlesbrough, seems to have lost his dribbling
and passing touch. He has also suffered numerous injuries and
attracted the wrong kind of publicity off the field.
	   Ankle and groin injuries sidelined him for much of last season
and, although he played 90 minutes of England's 0-0 tie with Saudi
Arabia and the 1-0 victory over Morocco on Wednesday, he managed
only half of the game against Belgium and limped off with a leg
injury.
	   In those three matches he looked ineffective, a shadow of the
creative player that made him a one-of-a-kind on previous English
sides.
	   Although Hoddle said he dropped Gascoigne over his lack of
fitness, he kept the faith with Les Ferdinand and Darren Anderton,
two Tottenham players who have been short on fitness and form this
season.
	   The move leaves England without a player with World Cup
experience. The club failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and reached the semifinals in 1990 in Italy.
	   Trevor Steven, Gascoigne's former England teammate, criticized
Hoddle's decision.
	   ``There's still two and a half weeks before kick off. Paul has
something that nobody else can offer the team and I would have just
given him that time.
	   ``As an England fan I would have loved to have seen him do well.
But the decision has been made and I think our squad is poorer for
the lack of Paul Gascoigne.''

	   MALAYSIA, with its extensive oil and gas reserves, is home to
three petrochemical centres. While Kerteh, Terengganu, is the
acknowledged ethylene hub of the east coast, Pasir Gudang, Johor,
is an alternative option for chemical and petrochemical investors.
The Gebeng Industrial Estate in verdant Pahang has developed as a
propylene centre and is attracting heavyweights in the global
industry.
	   With the economic downturn looming over the region, many
companies are embarking on affirmative measures to ensure they not
only stay afloat but thrive in rough weather. Likewise for
petrochemical giant, BASF (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   BASF is intent on staying focused and continuing to invest in
the country. The company has investment interests in two of the
three emerging petrochemical sites in the country. Its site in
Pasir Gudang is a stand-alone manufacturing facility churning out
plastics and specialty chemicals.
	   Total investments at the site amount to RM200 million. The site
at Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, is a tailor-made stand alone which
concentrates on blending and mixing facilities and will house
BASF's new headquarters. To date, BASF has poured in RM40 million
in its polyurethene system blending facility and more investment
ringgit is expected to flow in by the end of the decade. The
company is looking at investing RM80 million before the year 2000
for the facility at Bukit Jelutong. The Gebeng site in Pahang is
the company's integrated site and represents a joint-venture with
Petronas, concentrated on producing acrylic acid. This facility
involves the heftiest investment sum, running up a RM2.5 billion
bill.
	   The chemical market generally consists of two varieties:
commodity and speciality. These can be further broken down into
their smaller components. Commodity chemicals consist of
petrochemicals, which holds the biggest market share at 40 per
cent, inorganic chemicals (eight per cent), and textile chemicals
(10 per cent). Specialty chemicals are broken down into performance
chemicals (16 per cent of market share), pharmaceutical (16 per
cent), agrochemicals (10 percent), and fine chemicals also known as
pure chemicals (one per cent).
	   Overall, commodity chemicals make up 60 per cent of the world's
market and specialty chemicals make up the remaining 40 per cent.
Both markets are still growing. However, the market for chemicals
have not been sustaining growth other than pharmaceuticals and
performance chemicals.
	   The impact of these growing markets is significant; the bulk of
BASF's manufactures are speciality chemicals. BASF's array of
chemicals reads like an index list. The company classifies its
products into four broad areas: health and nutrition, colourants
and finishing products, chemicals, and plastics and fibre raw
materials.
	   BASF markets and sells nearly 850 products and more than 100 of
those are produced locally. By end of last year, BASF Malaysia's
sales turnover amounted to RM412 million. By the end of next year
it is expected to be between RM700 million and RM800 million while
by the year 2002, sales are estimated to hit RM1.3 billion to RM1.5
billion.
	   Of the company's total sales, 30 per cent is sourced from local
production and by the end of 1999, this will increase to 50 per
cent.
	   Juergen Knust, chairman of BASF Malaysia, says local production
will further increase when the joint-venture with Petronas fully
comes on stream. The business venture bodes well for BASF as
worldwide demand for acrylic acid is growing at a rate of four per
cent and the company is one of biggest producers in world.
	   In Malaysia, says Knust, the big industries are the electrical
and electronic industries and the related packaging industry, which
is driven by the company's Styropor production, which has the
largest turnover of production among all BASF's products. Up to
1997, the company imported 90 per cent of its raw materials. Since
end of last year, this 90 per cent has been reduced to just below
50 per cent due to increased production capacities anticipated in
the country.
	   Knust cites both the electrical and electronic industries as
BASF's strong markets. Other markets which the chemical giant has
its fingers in include the automotive, textile and construction
industries. Contrary to popular belief, Knust says the company
still supplies to the construction industry as it is the only
producer of Tamol, a super plasticiser used in the industry. About
70 per cent of BASF's clients in Malaysia are situated in the Klang
Valley.
	   Knust contends that, `Whilst there might be lesser volume of
products needed in Malaysia, we are undertaking greater exports,
especially to Asean where there is no major competitor producing
this material.' Knust cites two major factors as to why BASF is
doing well in the region. `We have our own production and 80 per
cent of this goes into the export market to Asean and other
countries. This market is doing well.
	   Another reason is because we have enough customers who are
export-oriented and that is why the company and the chemical
industry can sail relatively unscathed.' On the current domestic
market, there is no doubt that there is a slowdown, and Knust feels
that any company needs the export activities to balance out. `You
need this balancing act and a lot of effort to swing around your
marketing endeavours to be even more export-oriented as compared
with the past and I think we are into that mode.' And if the
downturn continues, the export figure will see a further increase
of another 10 per cent.
	   There comes a note of caution, however, as both BASF and most in
the industry did not expect the crisis to be so severe and not to
last for so long. `Until now we have not changed our plans because
overall we are doing very well. But as this situation carries on,
let's say into mid- year, then we'll have to revise down some of
our prospects. We are waiting and are being optimistic, but there
will be lesser gowth if this downturn continues.' Sales turnover
for Malaysia in the first quarter of this year increased 30 per
cent and if it continues on the uptrend, the company's plans remain
unchanged. New projects for the year will amount to RM150 million,
and if everything goes to plan, BASF will release three new
projects within the next three to six months. However, future
investments will have to be revised should the economic slowdown
continue into the year. `Looking back, we can only be glad that we
planned the buildings so much ahead of time,' says Knust while
reflecting on the increased costs nationwide. `There are certain
effects (from the economic slowdown) as we supply both the
automotive and construction industry. We are experiencing lesser
sales in these industries,' he acknowledges.
	   Delving into the subject of BASF's projects, Knust says that all
the company's projects are for the long term and based on long term
strategies. Everything is full steam ahead. This is possible, Knust
feels, as the current economic situation aids in weeding out
competition: `You get more and better suppliers.' He divulges that
there will be more projects to be announced this year and in due
course. The Bukit Jelutong plant is a medium-sized engagement and
will produce polyurethene. The investment cost for this runs up a
RM10 million price tag. By the end of the first quarter of 1999,
Knust hopes to transfer BASF's headquarters to the site. The
company's warehouse and domestic distribution centre will also be
in place by then. The master batch production is slated to be
running by mid-1999.
	   Generally, a sense of commitment is prevalent in the air. Of
BASF's investments, Knust says, `We have committed beforehand and
we've invested beforehand. Of course, certain services may be
cheaper now but we are here for the long term.'

Romania sets sights on semi-finals 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAFTICA, Romania (AP) _ Romania's soccer team hopes to make it
into the semi-finals of this summer's World Cup in France, topping
its performance of four years ago, when it fell in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``We might qualify for semifinals if we play well,'' said
Gheorghe Popescu, a key part of Romania's defense, who plays for
Turkey's champion Galatasaray.
	   His teammate with Galatasaray, Gheorghe Hagi, known as ``the
Maradona of the Carpathians,'' said Romania's most difficult game
would be its first one, June 15 against Colombia.
	   Although Romania beat Colombia in 1994 play, the first match is
often the toughest psychologically.
	   Dan Petrescu, a player for England's Chelsea, said Romania's
tournament strategy will depend on whether the team beats Colombia.
	   Romania plays in Group G, along with Colombia, England and
Tunisia. Romania and England are considered the front-runners.
	   Romania scored nine victories and one draw qualifying for the
World Cup.
	   The team achieved its best showing in the 1994 World Cup,
beating Colombia and the United States in the first round, and even
Argentina in a wild second-round match. Romania later fell to
Sweden in the quarterfinals.
	   The national team currently trains at their base of Saftica, 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Bucharest.
	   Coach Anghel Iordanescu is expected to announce the line-up for
the World Cup soon. Romania will have two warm-up games, with
Paraguay and Moldova, before leaving June 8 for France.

Precede CAIRO Abdullah in Jordan to resolve differences over Arab summit new quotes; changes byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Saudi crown prince in Jordan;
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah arrived in
Jordan Monday for talks aimed at resolving differences between key
Arab leaders on a proposed summit on the Middle East peace process.
	   Abdullah came from Damascus where he met at least twice with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to persuade him to accept an open
agenda at the proposed summit, Arab diplomats said.
	   Such a demand also has been made by Jordan and some Gulf
nations. But all agree that the summit should forge a unified Arab
position against Israel.
	   Talaat Hamid, spokesman for the 22-member Arab League, said in
Cairo that consultations are under way between Arab leaders over
the time and place for the summit. He gave no other details.
	   An Egyptian weekly newspaper reported that Morocco, Saudi Arabia
and Egypt have offered to host the summit.
	   The meeting was proposed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat who
wants the Arabs to take a tougher stance toward Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since peace talks have reached a
complete stalemate.
	   Syria has taken this one step further, insisting that the summit
should put the brakes on normalization of Arab ties with Israel,
said the diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan, Israel's closest Arab ally, apparently balks at that.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani declined to comment on the
hard-line Syrian position, saying ``they are free to say what they
want.''
	   But, he added, the summit should ``evaluate the situation and
(allow) each to express his opinion .. to agree and reach a
consensus.''
	   A senior Jordanian government official said that Jordan
``prefers that no conditions be placed prior to convening the
parley.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Anani said the summit's agenda will figure high in talks during
the two-day visit by the Saudi prince.
	   Emphasizing the importance of his visit, Abdullah was received
at the airport by King Hussein in a rare protocol gesture reserved
only for heads of state. The two leaders are scheduled to meet
privately.
	   Abdullah is the first top Saudi official to visit Jordan since
1990 when relations strained over Amman's perceived tilt toward
Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Meanwhile, the issue of Iraq is causing problems for the summit
too.
	   Most Gulf states oppose inviting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to the summit because of Gulf War rivalry. Syria says Iraq's
presence is needed for a united stance against Israel.
	   Several Arab countries also are unwilling to attend a summit
while the United States still is mediating on the Palestinian
issue. Once Washington announces its efforts have failed, Arafat
would likely meet less resistance.
	   Arafat began pushing for the summit after the United States
failed to convince Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13
percent troops pullback in the West Bank to restart talks. Arafat,
who wanted 30 percent, has accepted.

	   ALMOST every major information technology (IT) vendor is now
targeting the small and medium-sized industries (SMIs) with a
variety of offerings. Ask the people at IBM, Hewlett-Packard,
Compaq, Digital and others, and they will talk about their plans
and programmes to make headway in the SMI market. For them, this is
where their growth, or a sizeable portion of their business, is
going to come from this year.
	   Yes, size does matter and in this case, it's the small that is
expected to present the ``huge opportunity'' long sought by IT
vendors. The vendors, after taking a good look at what they have,
are packaging and re-packaging their products and services
specially to meet the needs of the SMIs.
	   Among the latest was Computer Associates which has packaged its
enterprise management offering Unicenter TNG into so-called
no-frills workgroup edition products. These are designed to be the
entry point into the company's extensive offerings, and aimed at
customers with less than 250 desktop clients. With the products
broken up into modules, customers only buy what they need and cost
is, of course, very much lower.
	   Based on research carried out by the US-based Aberdeen Group,
there is an untapped worldwide market of 1.5 million workgroup
units, and this is probably what CA is going for with its workgroup
edition products.
	   The SMI market, according to market researcher IDC Malaysia,
represents ``growth potential'' for IT vendors, especially when the
region is experiencing an economic downturn. The percentage of IT
usage in this sector is still considered low, as it was estimated
that 90 per cent of the companies have yet to computerise or still
require some form of computerisation. Most of those which have
computerised have employed IT mainly to process data. IT is used to
support operations, in areas such as accounting, human resource and
inventory management, and purchasing.
	   But IDC believes that IT usage is still remarkably low and these
companies will still have to spend on technology to save on
operational costs, and improve productivity in order to compete
effectively.
	   IDC Malaysia conducted a survey on the IT spending of local
companies, dividing them into small, medium and large. It was
interesting to note that 23.9 per cent of the small companies plan
to increase their IT spending this year. Even more encouraging was
that 26.5 per cent of the medium-sized companies which responded
also want to spend more on IT.
	   Under the current situation, large businesses are more likely to
leverage on their existing IT infrastructure. Instead of replacing
or increasing the IT equipment they have, they are more likely to
maintain what they already have. Here, there's still an opportunity
in the need for extended services and support. However, 34.6 per
cent of the large companies that took part in the IDC survey
informed that they intend to increase their IT spending this year.
So, not everyone is going to hold back.
	   Another trend noted in the survey was that 39.9 per cent of the
small companies and 35.4 per cent of the medium-sized were still
unsure whether to invest in IT. There is therefore a need to
promote awareness among SMIs on how they can use technology to make
their business more efficient.
	   Here's an opportunity for them to raise their level of
operations, and look into how local area networks (LANs), the
Internet and intranets can help them. They should be more willing
to invest, not just to survive but to plan ahead.
	   No wonder most of the vendors are already looking eagerly at the
SMIs.
	   Here's a growing opportunity to present new technologies and
products and services that could make a difference. In light of the
emphasis on SMIs, the grant scheme announced recently by the Small
and Medium Industries Development Corp (Smidec) to introduce a
grant scheme to promote greater adoption of IT by SMIs is a move in
the right direction.
	   Under the programme, SMIs are able to obtain financial
assistance in the purchase of manufacturing software. Smidec
proposed to finance 50 per cent of the total cost of the
manufacturing solutions purchased. Hopefully, the programme can be
expanded so that more small and medium-sized companies can reap the
benefits, and in the process become bigger.

	   Amway (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd is one of the top direct selling
companies in the country. Based on its 1997 annual report, the
company has fixed deposits of RM162.84 million, banker's
acceptances of RM114.74 million and cash balances of RM4 million.
It has a relatively clean balance sheet but its exposure to the US$
may be a cause of concern as the goods the company deals with are
mostly imported. Despite its US$ exposure, some analysts are upbeat
that the cash pile will not erode significantly.
	   DETERMINING the cash surplus of a public listed company is not
easy.
	   Based on the best available published figures and feedback from
research houses, we have attempted to compile a list of companies
with favourable cash positions. However, in evaluating the strength
of a company it must be remembered that there are several other
factors to consider as well, such as their long- and short-term
loans, the nature of business they are in and where they propose to
eventually invest this cash. Below are some companies with at least
RM150 million and above, based on latest published reports.
	   Amway (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd is one of the top direct selling
companies in the country. Based on its 1997 annual report, the
company has fixed deposits of RM162.84 million, banker's
acceptances of RM114.74 million and cash balances of RM4 million.
It has a relatively clean balance sheet but its exposure to the US$
may be a cause of concern as the goods the company deals with are
mostly imported. Despite its US$ exposure, some analysts are upbeat
that the cash pile will not erode significantly.
	   Datuk Keramat Holdings Bhd: Based on its 1997 annual report, the
company has deposits, bank and cash balances totalling RM595
million, mostly generated from the sale of its stake in the then
UMBC Bank to the Sime Darby Group. With short term borrowings of
RM150 million, the company appears to have a net cash holding of
about RM450 million. But much of it will be utilised to finance its
acquisition of a Swiss bank.
	   Golden Hope Plantations Bhd: After Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, this
PNB-linked plantation counter is perhaps the second most cash-rich
company in that sector with about RM400 million in cash and short
term deposits. With palm oil prices soaring with the depreciation
of the ringgit, Golden Hope is expected to further enhance its cash
position.
	   The only setback is the exposure of its 61 per cent subsidiary
Negara Properties to the real estate sector. With its healthy cash
position, Golden Hope may be called upon to play the role of a
white knight.
	   Genting Group: Even after subsidary Resorts World bought a 20
per cent stake in Star Cruises Plc for about RM950 million, the
group (which derives its main source of income from its gaming and
resort operations at Genting Highlands, Pahang) still has a cash
pile of RM2.5 billion left.
	   With so much cash, analysts feel the group is finding it harder
to make investment decisions. Among its investments in the past,
only the power project in Genting Sanyen seems to have paid off so
far. Even the Star Cruises investment is viewed with some sceptism
as the cruise business in general is affected by an economic
downturn.
	   The group does not have any substantial liability at the moment
but it remains to be seen if it can maintain a clean slate as the
cruise business is capital intensive and Star Cruises is expected
to add to its growing fleet in the next two years.
	   Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK): As of last year, the company was
sitting on a cash pile of RM400 million. This figure is expected to
rise to more than RM500 million by next year due to the healthy
prices of palm oil. The company is one of the solid plantation
stocks with conservative investment plans.
	   KLK is a 42 per cent associate of Batu Kawan Bhd, another
plantation stock. The negative element is that Batu Kawan has a 30
per cent stake in stock broking firm Smith-Zain Securities and some
exposure to property in mainland Penang. With the stock broking
industry in the doldrums, some analysts wonder if some of KLK's
cash surplus may be re-deployed elsewhere. However, analyst Liew
Kok Wai of BNP PrimeEast Research does not think such a
re-deployment will happen as Batu Kawan is conservative and
Smith-Zain Securities is well run.
	   Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC): The
country's premier shipping company had RM836.96 million in cash
deposits and bank balances as of December 1997. A portion of this
is expected to go into buying ships and tankers belonging to
Konsortium Perkapalan Bhd (KPB) for cash. MISC has already entered
into an agreement with KPB to purchase PNSL Ltd for US$ 55 million
cash. Besides that MISC will also acquire a few more assets of KPB.
	   After the acquisition, MISC's gearing will go up from 0.23 to
1.26.
	   Based on the latest annual report, its long term liabilities are
RM893.81 million. With the deal, MISC will have to assume all debts
of KPB which is close to US$ 310 million.
	   Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton): According to its 1997
annual report, cash and bank balances amount to RM1.46 billion. But
short term borrowings come up to RM109 million and long term
liabilities to RM357.47 million.
	   For the current year Proton, like most other automobile
companies, is expected to see a dip in earnings. Thus the surplus
cash may come in handy. Also, Proton needs to spend about RM500
million in developing new models to replace its Iswara and Wira
models.
	   Star Publications (M) Bhd: It has a strong cash position - RM212
million in deposits and cash balances with virtually no borrowings.
Like most publishing companies, the setback is the rising cost of
newsprint due to the ringgit's depreciation. An anaylst says that
it is yet to be seen how the company manages its cash and whether
it makes a wise investment decision. So far, the company's recent
purchase of its new headquarters building in Petaling Jaya has not
been viewed favourably as some feel the company could have waited
for property prices to come down further.
	   Telekom Malaysia Bhd: Has cash and cash equivalent amounting to
RM2.35 billion. But the premier telecommunications company in the
country has total borrowings of RM6.4 billion. Of this, RM283
million is due within one year and another RM984 million due after
one year but within the next five years. The hefty cash balance
will come in handy for Telekom in its expansion plans as it gears
for foreign competition next year.
	   Sime UEP Properties Bhd: A subsidiary of the diversified
conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd, it stands out among property stocks
with a cash position of RM360 million and virtually no borrowings.
It is also noted for its prudent and conservative management style.
It has an ample, cheap yet well-located landbank with a book cost
of less than RM2.00 psf.
	   The only fear is that the parent, Sime Darby, has reported a
loss for the first time in more than a decade due to its disastrous
move into the banking sector. Though some analysts doubt that any
cash from Sime UEP will be used to help out Sime Darby with its
cash flow, the possibility still exists.
	   Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd: This number forecast operator (NFO) has
deposits worth RM213 million and cash and bank balances of RM66.52
million based on its 1997 annual report. This total of RM279.5
million is less than the other two NFO players mainly because of
its track record of high dividend payments. It is these lucrative
dividend payments that make some analysts rule out the possibility
of BToto's cash reserves being channelled to other Berjaya
companies.
	   Magnum Corporation Bhd: Cash and bank balances of this company
is estimated at about half a billion ringgit, giving it a cash per
share of about 33 sen per share. The company had even more money in
quoted investments: RM603.2 million as at Dec 31, 1996. The bulk of
this - RM430.3 million - was invested in stocks on the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange directly or through unit trusts.
	   In its latest unaudited results for the year ended Dec 31, 1997,
the group admitted that the currency and stock market turbulence in
the region since last July had affected it. This has resulted in
the group having to set aside RM425.82m as provision for diminution
in value of this investment. In addition, there was a provision for
a further RM94.137 million for unrealised loss in foreign exchange
in respect of a foreign currency loan taken by a subsidiary.
Analysts say the company has foreign borrowings of about US$200
million.
	   Tanjong Plc: With about RM800 million in deposits and cash and
bankbalances, Tanjong has been one of the first few cash-rich
companies to announce what it plans to do with its money. It has
proposed to buy a 47 per cent stake in independent power producer,
Powertek Bhd, which will wipe out RM480 million from its cash
reserves.
	   If the deal goes through, it would trigger of a mandatory
general offer (MGO) for the remaining shares. This could drain
Tanjong's remaining cash and force it to take on borrowings,
thereby breaking its debt-free status.
	   Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd: This leading beer maker is not
only well known for its alcoholic beverage but also for its clean
balance sheet. A track record of keeping to its core business and
rewarding its shareholders with high dividends and bonus issues
lays to rest fears of Carlsberg using its cash reserves unwisely.
For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, bank balances and deposits were at
RM266.7 million. It is also a debt-free company.
	   Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd is sitting pretty on a cash pile of
RM256.6 million, made up of cash and bank balances and deposits
with banks. Its strong cash flow and zero borrowings puts it in a
good position to utilise its cash when opportunities present
themselves.
	   Analysts say the money could be used to expand Hap Seng's oil
palm operations or its food and beverage business, which currently
include a brewery in China and a 25 per cent stake in Carlsberg
Brewery Malaysia Bhd.
	   One worry is that controlling shareholder, Malaysian Mosaics
Berhad has the ability, through its 50.11 per cent stake in Hap
Seng, to tap into Hap Seng's cash via the injection of assets. Will
it happen? Analysts say that judging by Hap Seng's track record,
this is an unlikely prospect.
	   Matsushita Electric Company (Malaysia) Berhad was sitting on a
cash pile of RM178.5 million as at March 31, 1997, and it is likely
this money will remain with the electrical manufacturer for some
time to come. Reason: The conservative stance is traditional with
Japanese companies which only use their money as and when they need
it for expansion. Matsushita is also debt free.
	   YTL Corporation Bhd: The YTL group has two listed cash rich
entities, namely YTL Corp with RM3.63 billion and its 61-per cent
subsidiary , YTL Power with RM2.59 billion. However YTL Corp has
pledged the bulk of its cash reserves - RM2.14 billion - to a
financial institution for a bank guarantee facility granted to one
of its subsidiaries. YTL Corp also has cash balances of RM93
million but this is expected to be used to redeem bonds upon
maturity. It also has term loans of RM707.12 million payable within
one year and another RM905.86 million due after one year but within
five years.
	   YTL Power has close to RM2.55 billion in term loans, made up of
bank loans (RM1.11 billion) and fixed rate bonds (RM1.43 billion).
Most of these loans are repayable after more than a year. This is a
positive note in light of the fact that being an IPP, it is assured
of a fixed annual turnover of more than RM1.17 billion, by virtue
of its power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Analysts
believe that the YTL group as a whole has more than RM1 billion
available for investments or capital expenditure.
	   Selangor Properties Bhd is one of the few property companies
said to have huge cash reserves. As at Oct 31, 1997, this company
had cash and cash equivalents of over RM450 million and was debt
free. This gives it a cash to share ratio of RM1.30. It has a
steady stream of income from rentals from its commercial properties
which are concentrated in the Damansara area. However, its cash
pile might be reduced as the company is acquiring a piece of land
for RM335.41 million cash payable over five years.
	   Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd's net cash position is expected to
reach more than RM200 million by the end of this year. Analysts say
this is good for the company as it will put it in a strong position
to weather the current downcycle in vehicle sales and capitalise on
the eventual recovery of the motor industry.
	   However, the bulk of this amount may go to finance the company's
proposed share buy back scheme of 10 per cent of its share capital.
	   However, analysts add that it is unlikely the company will buy
back the shares all at once and, instead, may stagger the buy back
process. Also, some of its cash may go toward a special dividend
the company will be giving as part of its demerger exercise.
	   Sapura Telecommunications Bhd's cash reserves were boosted after
the disposal of stakes in Uniphone Sdn Bhd and Sapura Digital Sdn
Bhd to Time RM452.66 million. About half this money however was
used to retire loans.
	   Although Sapura has yet to do anything with the balance of about
RM264 million, analysts say that based on a recent increase in the
company's interest income, the money is believed to be parked in
banks and finance companies. However, at about the same time,
Sapura has proposed to acquire stakes in companies belonging to
parent, Sapura Holdings Sdn Bhd (SHSB).
	   These transactions should reduce Sapura's cash reserves.
	   As at Jan 31, 1997, Sapura's bank borrowings stood at RM266.22
million.
	   Rothmans of Pall Mall Malaysia Bhd: Known for giving out one of
the highest dividends, Rothmans has about RM560 in its bank and
cash balances.
	   This debt-free company also has bank guaranteed corporate bonds
and loan stock of RM49.6 million at cost and Malaysian government
securities of RM52.7 million at cost. Taking the latter's cash
equivalents into account, Rothmans is sitting pretty on RM662.3
million. Analysts say that based on Rothman's track record, when
its cash and bank balances reach between RM600 million and RM700
million, this would trigger off a special cash dividend. This means
Rothman's will most probably be paying back its reserves to its
shareholders.
	   Gamuda Berhad: This construction giant has about RM253.5 million
in deposits and RM12.7 million in cash and bank balances. However,
according to the 1997 annual report, its bank borrowings, made up
of term loans, overdrafts and banker's acceptances amount to RM10.5
million. The company also has issued long term bonds worth RM190
million which will expire in 2000 and 2001.
	   The company's investments amount to RM60.8 million at cost and
are mostly invested in investment management funds within Malaysia
(RM10.3 million) and outside Malaysia (RM50.4 million). This would
give it a total cash and cash equivalents of RM327 million but
total long and short term borrowings of RM200.5 million. Analysts
say that although the company has cash, much of it is tied up with
its highway projects in the city.
	   Petronas Gas Bhd: The 74.92 per cent subsidiary of Petronas sat
on a cash pile of RM898.13 million as at March 31 last year.
However, it has long term loans of RM2.31 billion including
Yen-denominated bonds. The bright spark is that Petronas Gas has an
assured earnings stream by processing gas generated from its parent
to service the loans. Also it has already paid for the bulk of its
capital expenditure to increase the gas processing facility in
Terengganu.
	   Trenergy (Malaysia) Bhd: The second board company is believed to
have close to RM300 million following the sale of its US-based
Hercules Offshore Corporation (HOC). When the company acquired HOC
in 1996, nobody thought much of it. However, it sold HOC early this
year when the US$ was at its peak against the ringgit and this
translated into a hefty extraordinary gain for Trenergy.
	   However, the bulk of the money is to be used to refurbish a
vessel into a floating, production, storage and off-loading
facility. The facility is to be leased to Petronas in a long term
contract worth more than RM500 million. Some analysts feel another
setback is that Trenergy is closely linked to the cash-strapped
Renong Group.
	   Daiman Development Berhad: This property-based company has fixed
deposits and cash balances of RM144.5 million as of June last year.
But analysts believe this cash pile may have increased to RM156
million as of December last year. However a portion of this -
RM25.7 million - is pledged to banks to secure bank guarantees and
a term loan of RM15.5 million. This still leaves it with over RM100
million in cash. Analysts who follow this counter say the company
has a good track record in terms of cash management.

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ A top official of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission on Monday indirectly blamed former
President P.W. Botha for the killings of black activists during
apartheid.
	   Botha is on trial for ignoring a summons to appear before the
Truth Commission, which is probing apartheid-era human rights
abuses. But the trial _ the first ever of a former South African
head of state _ has focused on Botha's role as chairman of the
State Security Council, which coordinated a security crackdown on
black liberation groups.
	   Truth Commission executive secretary Paul van Zyl said minutes
from State Security Council meetings contained words like
``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' when referring to opponents of
white rule. Botha headed the security council when he was head of
state.
	   ``It is quite clear from these documents, as we interpret it,
the word eliminate means kill,'' van Zyl said shortly after Botha's
trial resumed Monday after being postponed for six weeks.
	   In showing why it wants to question Botha, the Truth Commission
has presented the court in this southern coastal town with dozens
of documents implicating Botha, who led South Africa from
1978-1989, in atrocities.
	   Van Zyl said the Security Council had been briefed in 1979 about
plans to launch overseas operations against members of the African
National Congress, including sending bombs in the mail.
	   Wearing a dark suit and foregoing a cane which he has normally
used since a hip replacement last year, Botha impassively listened
to the testimony.
	   His lawyer, Lappe Laubscher, complained that van Zyl was
diverting the case to uncovering Security Council deeds.
	   ``Both of us are going to retire in George if you continue like
this,'' Laubscher joked.
	   Botha, 82, had greeted the supporters as he entered the court,
located near his retirement home in the village of Wilderness.
	   Prosecutor Bruce Morrison raised the possibility that Eugene de
Kock, a former police colonel who headed a group of apartheid-era
assassins, may testify.
	   De Kock, currently serving a life prison term, carried out the
1988 bombing of an anti-apartheid group's offices. Former national
police chief Johan van der Merwe has told the Truth Commission that
Botha authorized the attack.
	   Morrison said he wanted to ``consult'' with 4panel wants
to humiliate him by forcing him to appear in person.
	   He faces two years imprisonment and unspecified fines if
convicted.

<TEXT>
	   IT'S FUNNY how sentiment on a stock can swing so wildly in a
space of just six months. For most of last year, Singapore Telecom
(SingTel) was under tremendous selling pressure. The reasons: the
onslaught of competition in the mobile communications sector and
its high share price relative to other regional telecom companies.
	   Consequently, in the initial weeks after April 1, 1997, - the
day SingTel lost its monopoly in the mobile phone and paging
markets - its share price hit one record low after another. It sank
to a depth of S$2.05 in September. Some S$19 billion in market
capitalisation was wiped out. In the six months to September,
SingTel underperformed the entire market by 17 per cent.
	   But a twist of fortune came with the unlikeliest of events - the
regional currency crisis. With its predictable earnings stream and
huge cash pile, SingTel rose from the deep to emerge as `an island
of stability in a sea of volatility'.
	   Asian funds muscled their way onto SingTel's share register. By
March 5, SingTel shares had regained all their losses and more. In
the last six months, the share price gained S$1.21 to S$3.26 -
outperforming the Stock Exchange of Singapore's All Shares Index by
a staggering 55 per cent.
	   Analysts are now singing a slightly different tune, swayed
partly by SingTel's sterling 12 per cent growth in interim
earnings.
	   A number have since upgraded their calls: from sell to hold,
from hold to buy or accumulate. According to The Estimate
Directory, 60 per cent of analysts who track SingTel are now
recommending a buy or a hold. This compares to below 50 per cent in
November.
	   Houses which have upgraded their calls include Credit Lyonnais,
ING Barings, GK Goh, Tsang  Ong and UBS.
	   GK Goh's Alayne Wong says, `Under current market conditions,
SingTel's defensive nature overrides its premium valuation.' She
recommends SingTel as a core portfolio holding for the Singapore
market.
	   ING Barings' regional telecom analyst Gautam Kapoor argues that
although SingTel is overvalued in some parameters, these parameters
do not capture qualitative issues.
	   For example, they do not take into consideration replacement
costs, the management team and other local conditions. `At the end
of the day, it depends on the market. SingTel is operating in an
environment with more certainty. It's a safe stock with good
earnings visibility,' he says.
	   Analysts think that SingTel will continue to be a good place to
park one's money until the financial storm in Southeast Asia blows
over.
	   However, most refrain from setting a price target for SingTel.
	   So, fundamentally, compared with six months ago, what has
changed about SingTel? For one thing, the financial crisis has
jacked up interest rates.
	   SingTel, with its cash hoard amounting to some S$4 billion,
looks set to benefit in higher interest income.
	   But operationally, there will be adverse impact, as SingTel
readily admits. `Traditionally, there is a strong correlation
between our earnings and the level of economic activity both in
Singapore and the region,' says the group's investor relations
manager Karena Tay. `The current regional turmoil is expected to
impact on Singapore's economy, and telecommunications business will
likewise be affected.' The writing could already be on the wall.
Outgoing international telephone calls, which contribute 44 per
cent to SingTel's group turnover, grew by a mere 2.3 per cent in
volume terms in January this year. This pales in comparison to the
double-digit year-on-year growth the business enjoyed throughout
1997.
	   As for the appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the
regional units and its depreciation against other major currencies
in the West, they cut both ways.
	   First, on the expenses side, SingTel will now have to fork out
more to pay for traffic expenses, the fees it pays other telcos to
complete international calls. These expenses - SingTel's largest
cost component -are denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
which are pegged to a basket of major currencies. On the other
hand, income from its foreign associate Belgacom will now translate
into 10 per cent more Singapore dollars.
	   The plunge in regional currencies has also meant that SingTel's
investments in Indonesia and the Philippines are worth a fraction
of their earlier valuations. The investment cost in Globe Telecom,
for instance, was S$155.7 million. At today's prices and exchange
rates, the value is now down to a fifth at about S$31.6 million. In
Indonesia, the group has invested S$28 million as at March 31 last
year in its joint venture PT SingTel Bukaka.
	   But on the bright side, SingTel's share of Globe Telecom's
losses, too, will be very much less. The crisis could also present
SingTel with opportunities to buy up regional assets at bargain
prices.
	   Overall, analysts think SingTel will weather the storm well. The
consensus earning forecast for SingTel is still a healthy 13 per
cent growth for the financial year ending March 31, 1998, and 11
per cent for 1999.
	   Paribas Asia Equity's senior telecom analyst Neil Juggins is
more bullish. He expects SingTel to post a 15.3 per cent surge in
net profit to S$1.914 billion this year, followed by another 13.8
per cent next year to S$2.178 billion. SingTel shares, he says,
will outperform the market in the next 12 months.
	   Analysts anticipate earnings growth to come from local and
international calls as well as value-added services. ING Barings'
Gautam Kapoor sees increased profit in the cellular business as
well, despite SingTel's loss of market share. This, he said, could
be achieved with better cost control.
	   Meanwhile, SingTel has smartened up a lot after its first taste
of competition. It is more market-savvy now and its ads are being
noticed. It is assiduously building up its brand name and gearing
up for competition in the fixed-line and international calls
businesses by 2000.
	   It has stepped up efforts, and has been enjoying some success,
in pulling second or third lines to homes. There is still room for
growth as new demand will come from new homes and businesses and
new multimedia services like Magix. Last year's line growth of 9.4
per cent is the highest SingTel has had for the last 15 years.
	   And when full competition ensues, SingTel is set to be a tough
contender. Today, SingTel is as competitive as, if not more than,
any telco in the region. According to a study by the National
University of Singapore, SingTel's rates are the cheapest in this
part of the world, ahead of Australia's Telstra, HK Telecom and
Japan's KDD.
	   Beyond 2000, SingTel expects overseas investments to contribute
about 10 per cent to its bottomline. A new earnings stream is also
expected from its first satellite to be launched this year, ST-1.
The satellite could potentially rake in revenues of S$42 million a
year.
	   But a word of caution before you rush in to buy more SingTel
shares.
	   Some analysts think SingTel is only good while the going is
tough. And once the financial markets stabilise, the stock will
lose its safe-haven status.
	   At S$3.24 as at March 6 (price earnings: 26 times on expected
1999 earnings), it is one of the most expensive telecom stocks
around.
	   Merrill Lynch's Adam Quinton, who is advising his clients to
reduce holdings of SingTel shares, says the group's cashflow and
earnings growth are not compelling enough to sustain the current
price. `SingTel is going to underperform the market in the long
term.' For now, however, the fallout in the region, which could
last well into 1999, should keep SingTel in the limelight. -

	   TELEKOM Malaysia Berhad is confident of turning the Mobikom
cellular service into a profitable business with the proposed
upgrading of infrastructure and injection of expertise.
	   Its chairman Datuk Ali Hassan said with Telekom's years of
experience in the telecommunications sector, it could turn Mobikom
into one of its biggest revenue earners in future.
	   Ali said Mobikom also stood to contribute a great deal to
Telekom compared to other cellular services it operated because of
Mobikom's large subscriber base of 300,000.
	   Telekom also operates two other cellular services, the Atur 450
which has about 80,000 active subscribers and TM Touch which has
120,000 active subscribers.
	   He said this when commenting on Telekom's takeover of mobile
phone operator Mobikom Sdn Bhd for RM232.7 million on May 14.
	   Ali was speaking to reporters after launching the northern
region World Telecommunications Day celebrations at the Alor Star
telecommunications tower on Saturday.
	   Also present were Menteri Besar Tan Sri Sanusi Junid, Telekom
chief operating officer for telephony Datuk Dr Rahim Daud,
Kedah/Perlis chief business operations officer Sharoom Cha and
State executive councillors.
	   Earlier in his speech, Ali said to date Telekom had completed 92
of 200 proposed infrastructure projects in the State. This includes
84 fibre optic projects.

	   AS a sign of the difficult times, the advertising industry is
usually one of the first to be hit as companies begin to slash
marketing budgets in order to conserve cash flow.
	   The ardent television viewer will have noticed that there are
fewer commercials and that music videos have made a comeback to
fill airtime in-between shows.
	   In an increasingly competitive market, outdoor advertising firm
Ganad Corporation Bhd remains optimistic it will be able to sustain
itself during these lean times on its many long-term contracts
(usually three to five years) sealed with multinational
corporations.
	   Some of its customers include Citibank, Toyota, Samsung and
Marlboro.
	   Assistant general manager Cheng Kee How said despite a
consolidation in spending, Ganad would push for a bigger slice of
the market, targeting about a third of new business.
	   ``We are very aggressive and are discussing with some
multinational corporations for new business.
	   ``This will offset the industry slowdown and we will maintain
our business,'' he said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Cheng said some of the multinational companies have contracts
with Ganad's associate companies abroad.
	   Ganad began regional expansion a few years ago into Myanmar,
Cambodia, Thailand and China.
	   Assessing the outdoor advertising segment, Cheng said it
remained a small portion of the entire advertising industry and had
seen a 20 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in spending.
	   The other segments of the industry comprise television, radio,
newspapers, magazines, rediffusion, video, cinema and
point-of-sale.
	   Newspapers command the largest slice of total advertising
dollars at 60 per cent, or RM1.59 billion of a total RM2.61 billion
last year.
	   Nevertheless, Cheng said there had been a shift towards more
outdoor advertising since television programming became more
cluttered.
	   With more new highways and expressways, prospects for the
outdoor advertising segment are on the rise.
	   He cited highways to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport as a
good location to project the corporate image of multinational firms
to visitors.
	   ``Visitors will also have confidence in a country when they see
the advertisements of big multinationals, and so outdoor
advertising is serving its purpose in that way.''
	   With the Commonwealth Games in September, Ganad is doing its bit
to promote the event.
	   It is sponsoring some 70 billboard sites nationwide, worth a
total of RM20,000 each. The campaign, which began six months ago,
now sees some 50 billboards erected.

	   THE inclusion of independent market research in the Securities
Commission's (SC's) requirement for listing exercises on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange in 1996 has proven to be a boon for Sofres
Group, a French-based market researcher.
	   Sofres FSA Malaysia (formerly Frank Small  Associates) managing
director Iain R Bell explains, `Companies now need to provide
market research reports on the particular industry they are
involved in, which include nature of industry, list of key players,
market size, outlook and areas of growth for the industry for the
next five years. This is where Sofres Malaysia has an advantage
with the backing of the Sofres Group. The Malaysian operations have
grown to become the largest Asia-Pacific office of the group, which
has a total of 23 offices in 12 Asia-Pacific countries,' he
enthuses.
	   `Market research in Malaysia is undergoing a renaissance of
sorts where an increasing number of local and multinational
companies are looking to the industry as an important component of
their business and marketing strategies,' he says.
	   He continues that the demand for market research services is on
the uptrend, both locally and globally, as businesses are
increasingly aware that research has a positive effect on their bid
to stay ahead. Knowledge of business markets, customer needs and
identification of new opportunities are paramount to sustaining or
expanding the business.
	   Market research plays a critical role in the success of a
company, as it assists organisations to fulfil their objectives by
providing detailed, cost-effective and timely market information,
along with quality interpretation, analysis and understanding that
form the basis for the development of optimal strategic planning.
	   In fact, this was the basis of the group's latest merger last
November with United Kingdom-based Taylor Nelson AGB, resulting in
the creation of the fourth largest market research company in the
world, which recorded a turnover of US$ 450 million for FY December
1997. The merger involved Taylor Nelson acquiring STG119 million
worth of shares in Sofres' holding company. Subsequently, it was
listed on the London Stock Exchange and is managed by directors
from both companies.
	   The new entity, Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS), has a network of
over 4,000 professionals in 32 countries. The merger creates one of
the widest product ranges in the industry, combining Sofres' and
Taylor Nelson's combined strengths in continuous panels, databases
and branded research products. Bell expands on the operations of
Sofres Malaysia, `1996 was a good year with almost 70 per cent of
our revenue coming from market research for listing exercises. But
with the SC clamping down on new listings last year, the company
has now ventured into other areas of growth.' The total number of
companies supported by Sofres Malaysia for their listing exercise
between 1996 and 1997 stands at 23, involving a wide range of
industries. Apart from this, the company had done 19 independent
market reports for various industries in 1996, while the number of
independent market reports rose to 21 in 1997.
	   He highlights that the local market research industry in 1997
was RM52 million and this is estimated to increase to RM60 million
in 1998. Sofres Malaysia has recorded between a 15 per cent and 20
per cent revenue growth for the past five years, and is expected to
peg a 18 per cent growth in revenue this year. Furthermore, 22 per
cent of total revenue is derived from overseas clients.
	   `Sofres Malaysia has a 31 per cent market share in the industry
while Survey Research Malaysia (SRG Nielson) has a 45 per cent
market share. The remaining market share is divided among other
players in the industry.
	   There are about 12 to 15 research companies in the country, some
local while others are offices of regional companies,' he divulges.
	   A further boost to the Malaysian operations comes in the form of
being the only market research firm in Asia to achieve QCSI
(Quality Control System for Interviewing) accredition. Bell
elaborates, `Over 152,000 interviews were conducted in 1997 all on
an ad-hoc basis. In the same period, more than 450 focus groups and
550 individual jobs were also conducted.' According to Sofres
Malaysia associate director Supramaniam Letchumanan, the company
comprises 120 staff and has five core divisions -consumer, business
and property, services, media, and social and community. In
addition, there are six specialist units - healthcare/personal
care, telecommunications, food and beverage, automotive, financial,
advertising testing/ tracking.
	   `The consumer division (FMCG) forms 50.4 per cent of the total
business done, followed by high tech/telecom/business to business
research - 23 per cent, media - 9.4 per cent, corporate
communication/human resource - 8.1 per cent, and automotive - 4.2
per cent. The rest of the divisions contribute a minimal amount,'
he says.
	   Currently, Sofres Malaysia is focusing on market sectors of real
growth in terms of research and development which is in the areas
of pharmaceuticals, automotives, telecommunications, information
technology and healthcare. Bell emphasises that apart from
providing research materials for overseas companies to enter the
local market, the current trend is for more local companies to test
the overseas markets.
	   `In fact, the SC's requirement for companies to have market
research done is a boon in more ways than one. Although most of our
clients started the research for the purpose of listing, somewhere
along the line, they realised that the research was useful for many
other things,' he says.
	   In the near future, the Malaysian operations will be introducing
other products which are being marketed by the group. He cites the
financial public relations research - which is a tool to improve
share value, make it easier to raise capital in financial markets
and develop more effective corporate communications - as an
example.
	   The financial public relations research product has been
marketed in France and Europe successfully for the past five to six
years, and will be launched in Malaysia within two months. `We are
looking at a contribution of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of
the revenue from this product in France and expect similar
contributions to the Malaysian operations once the product is
introduced here. In the course of time, other products will also be
introduced in Malaysia,' he adds.

	   CRABTREE  Evelyn (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, opened its flagship store at the Suria
Kuala Lumpur City Centre on Friday.
	   The store, which is the biggest in the Asia-Pacific region,
sells toiletries and fine food.
	   Crabtree  Evelyn also has another outlet at the Starhill Centre
which was opened last December.
	   Asia-Pacific sales and marketing manager Frederic Puech, who was
present at the opening, said that there were 62 outlets in the
Asia-Pacific region and they are considering opening another in
Penang.
	   ``Penang is a possibility but for the moment we will concentrate
on promoting our flagship store at the KLCC,'' said Puech.
	   The promotion campaign is by way of encouraging customers to
experience the products themselves.
	   ``In the case of our soaps, customers can actually wash their
hands with the various kinds of soap. For that purpose we have a
wash basin available. We want our customers to browse around the
outlet and sample the products.
	   ``During the months of May and June visitors to the store will
be treated to food tasting and aromatherapy hand massage. Shoppers
can also take advantage of special gifts with purchases.
	   ``Our prices are very competitive and our products are of very
high quality,'' said Puech.
	   He did not want to reveal the total investment in Malaysia.
	   On the products sold in the outlet, Puech said all of them are
manufactured overseas.
	   ``The soaps are made in Switzerland while the perfumes are from
France.
	   Toiletries are from Wales while some food products are from
England.''
	   KLK bought over Crabtree  Evelyn in July 1996.

	   JARRAD, a 39-year-old computer programmer, was diagnosed with
high blood pressure. He had sought medical help for headaches,
tiredness and trouble sleeping. When his doctor asked about stress,
Jarrad initially said that everything was find. But when the doctor
probed further, about home and work, Jarrad admitted that his boss,
Bill, was a real negative person.
	   Bill only noticed the negative and never gave him any positive
feedback.
	   Jarrad never knew if his job was secure and he felt as though he
never lived up to what Bill expected. Jarrad had thought about
leaving his job many times but with the lack of hiring in his field
he never felt it was possible. Jarrad's doctor prescribed blood
pressure medication for the rest of his life.
	   Dealing with a difficult boss on a day-to-day basis can have
both physical and emotional consequences, including such diverse
problems as hypertension, headaches, stomach aches, diarrhoea,
insomnia, depression and nervousness. In addition, having problems
at work often affect a person's home life, causing increased
conflict within a marriage or with the children.
	   As a psychiatrist I've treated many people who had a difficult
boss. Job insecurity is more prevalent than several years ago which
gives many employees the feeling that they have to put up with
whatever an employer dishes out. As mental health professionals
know, however, perception is everything. When you believe that you
have to put up with mistreatment then you put up with it at
whatever personal cost to yourself. When you believe that you can
do something about a difficult situation then you generally tackle
it in a positive way. There are many tactics you can use to deal
with a difficult boss, besides blowing up or quitting. Here are
five strategies: l Clarify your job expectations. Make sure that
your work goals match what your boss wants from you. Many
disagreements between an employer and employee stem from unclear
expectations. Rather than blaming your boss for not being clear
with what he or she wants, take the initiative to clarify goals to
ensure you're on the right track.
	   l Assume the best about your boss, unless you have clear reasons
to the contrary. Bosses are people too. Most people in charge want
to do a good job and want their employees to succeed. Sure, many
supervisors or employers could do a better job or could benefit
from more management training, but most of the supervisors I've met
want what's best for their employees. When you expect the best,
your attitude and work performance improves which goes a long way
to improving your relationship with your boss.
	   l When you feel your boss is upset with you check it out. Since
employers and supervisors are in positions of authority their every
action is interpreted by those who work for them. If an employee
has `authority issues' from their past, he or she may misinterpret
the boss' attitude or actions and be upset over a misunderstanding.
I tell my patients that a negative look from a boss may mean
nothing more than constipation on his part. You don't know unless
you check it out! l If your boss throws tantrums, don't cower and
don't provoke. Some bosses are emotional and belligerent by nature,
some are that way because it gets them their way. If you cower and
give in to them when they get upset, they will bully you as a
matter of course. If you provoke them further when they're upset
you may end up fired. The best way to deal with a bullying boss is
to remain calm (even though you feel like screaming) and assert
your point in a positive way. Many difficult bosses will have more
respect for you if you stand up to them in a respectful way. If you
stay calm when the boss is out of control he or she is likely to
pull it together in order not to look like a fool.
	   l Reinforce your boss when he or she is giving you the feedback
you need to do your job. Too often employees see themselves in a
powerless `one down' position with their boss. Employees can shape
the boss' behaviour with positive reinforcement. For example, when
the boss gives you good feedback tell him or her how much you need
and appreciate it. If you notice your boss having a hard time with
his or her boss, let them know that you appreciate their efforts
and know things will work out. A kind word or a smile goes a long
way to disarming a fuming boss.
	   Using these simple strategies will give you some power in
dealing with a difficult boss. Never forget that a work
relationship goes two ways and that you have some responsibility
for shaping the relationship. Now, if the boss is totally
impossible and nothing works to turn the relationship around, look
for another job. Working for a boss you hate over a long period of
time will take years off your life. When you leave, however,
(especially during this economy) plan you exit to a timetable that
fits your needs, not the needs of your angry impulses. - UPS

More deaths reported in Kosovo; thousands flee trims.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Refugees from Serbia's Kosovo
province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to escape some
of the worst fighting in months. Dozens of people were reported
killed.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources often were contradictory
and could not be independently verified. But with 39 people
reported killed over the weekend, and fighting apparently
continuing, the bloodshed seemed the worst since early March, when
Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a crackdown on
independence-minded militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said. They said more were arriving
by the hour.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom had walked for as
many as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a
school. Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Community to intervene ``for ending the
massacre in Kosovo.''
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragical dimensions,''
the statement said.
	   Authorities in Serbia, which with Montenegro comprises all that
remains of the Yugoslav federation, are trying to block Kosovo's
independence bid. They are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March. An estimated 50 percent of the Serbian province
is controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked
off, either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday. In Pristina, about 10,000 ethnic
Albanians, including 2,000 children, marched to protest Serbian
rule.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday accused ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' of killing several of their
countrymen while shelling several villages near the border with
Albania whose residents do not support the militants.

Precede CAIRO Abdullah in Jordan to resolve differences over Arab summit byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Saudi crown prince in Jordan; new quotes; changes
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah arrived Monday
in Jordan for talks aimed at resolving differences between key Arab
leaders on a proposed summit on the Middle East peace process.
	   Abdullah came from Damascus where he met at least twice with
Syrian President Hafez Assad to persuade him to accept an open
agenda at the proposed summit, Arab diplomats said.
	   Such a demand also has been made by Jordan and some Gulf
nations. But all agree that the summit should forge a unified Arab
position against Israel.
	   Talaat Hamid, spokesman for the 22-member Arab League, said in
Cairo that consultations are under way between Arab leaders over
the time and place for the summit. He gave no other details.
	   An Egyptian weekly newspaper reported that Morocco, Saudi Arabia
and Egypt have offered to host the summit.
	   The meeting was proposed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
who wants the Arabs to take a tougher stance toward Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since peace talks have reached a
deadlock.
	   Arafat began pushing for the summit after the United States
failed to convince Netanyahu to accept a compromise of a further 13
percent troops pullback in the West Bank to restart talks. Arafat,
who wanted 30 percent, has accepted.
	   Syria has insisted the summit should put the brakes on
normalization of Arab ties with Israel, said the diplomats,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Jordan, Israel's closest Arab ally, apparently balks at that.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani declined to comment on the
hard-line Syrian position, saying ``they are free to say what they
want,'' but the summit should ``evaluate the situation and (allow)
each to express his opinion .. to agree and reach a consensus.''
	   A senior Jordanian government official said Jordan ``prefers
that no conditions be placed prior to convening the parley.'' The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Anani said the summit's agenda will figure high in talks during
the two-day visit by the Saudi prince.
	   Emphasizing the importance of his visit, Abdullah was received
at the airport by King Hussein in a rare protocol gesture reserved
only for heads of state. The two leaders are scheduled to meet
privately.
	   Abdullah is the first top Saudi official to visit Jordan since
1990 when relations strained over Amman's perceived tilt toward
Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Meanwhile, the issue of Iraq is causing problems for the summit
too.
	   Most Gulf states oppose inviting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to the summit because of Gulf War rivalry. Syria says Iraq's
presence is needed for a united stance against Israel.
	   Several Arab countries also are unwilling to attend a summit
while the United States still is mediating on the Palestinian
issue. Once Washington announces its efforts have failed, Arafat
would likely meet less resistance.

Argentina seeks contracts under Iraq's U.N. oil deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Argentina is seeking contracts to sell Iraq
food items under the U.N. approved oil-for-food deal, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
	   It said a senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, Morcelo
Avocadro, met with Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh on
Monday to discuss ways of expanding bilateral trade.
	   ``The possibility of Argentine companies getting contracts under
the next phase of the oil-for-food deal was reviewed,'' INA said.
	   The deal allows Iraq to sell a limited quantity of oil every six
month to help it overcome shortages caused by U.N. economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq can sell
up to dlrs 5.2 billion worth oil in the latest phase beginning June
3, instead of dlrs 2 billion worth permitted in previous phases.
	   Iraq plans to use dlrs 3 billion for buying food, medicines and
other humanitarian goods from the oil revenue, up from dlrs 1.3
billion it used to spend every six months in the earlier phases of
the deal.
	   INA quoted Avocadro as saying that Argentina want contracts to
supply Iraq with wheat, maize and cooking oil. Avocadro is the
undersecretary for trade relations in his ministry.
	   According to U.N. figures Argentina sold commodities worth dlrs
7 million to Iraq in the past 18 months.

<TEXT>
	   IF MELBOURNE holds the largest Greek community outside Greece,
Perth has attracted the largest proportion of Asian settlers from
the region. And if the rest of Australia seems increasingly mired
in Asia's woes, could Western Australia also face a similar impact?
	   Most Asians in Perth don't seem particularly perturbed about the
impact from Asia's turmoil. In fact, much Asian investment still
finds its way to Western Australia. Perhaps it's because of the
Asian congeniality factor.
	   But geographical proximity to Asia also counts for a lot.
	   Still, there are the doubters. They say there is no state in
Australia more exposed to the sick economies of Asia than Western
Australia (WA).
	   So, the popular argument goes, WA must itself be about to become
a basket case.
	   Don't you believe it. WA could still grow faster than the rest
of the Australian economy in the coming financial year. Indeed, the
Court government is budgeting on it. The official forecast for
1998-99 built into the recent budget is a whopping five per cent -
almost two percentage points faster than the likely national growth
rate, and not far short of WA's average growth for the past decade.
	   On the Treasury's reckoning Asia will cost WA one percentage
point of growth, ask the Canberra-based consultant Access Economics
and it will tell you WA's forecast is a more conservative 3.5 per
cent to four per cent. That's still a good half a percentage point
above the likely national growth rate.
	   WA's growth will depend on how quickly the main economies in
Asia turn the corner. But if Asia's turnaround is reasonably rapid,
the state can expect growth to be pushed along by strong investment
in the resource sector. According to Ed Shann, director of Access
Economics, there are resource projects worth A$14 billion in the
pipeline, for which a decision on whether to proceed will be made
in the next 12 months.
	   The most important of these projects is the North-West Shelf LNG
expansion, the cheapest version of which is worth A$6 billion, and
the An Feng Kingstream steel plant which, with associated
infrastructure, is worth A$2.5 billion. That's thanks to Asian
investment, especially from Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, China
and Malaysia, all of whom realise the importance of natural
resources for fuelling their own economic growth.
	   Obviously Shann isn't worried. `If they go ahead I don't think
there's much to worry about,' he says. `There are some gold mines
that have closed; there will clearly be something taken off the top
of construction activity. But there will still be very high mining
investment in WA.' The potential for strong investment was
reaffirmed in the last Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey
of business investment intentions, taken in the early months of
this year. According to the ABS, business in WA is expected to lift
investment by another whopping 18 per cent in 1998-1999.
	   The state Treasury, taking a more conservative line and allowing
for some delay in the North-West Shelf project, is looking for
growth of about eight per cent. That should now be the envy of many
Asian countries whose stripes have been lifted off their 'tiger'
economies in the ongoing turmoil. But whatever the long-term
effects of the native title law in Australia, on which the Howard
government has taken a recalcitrant stance, there is no sign of it
affecting the level of investment in the short term.
	   Still, there are no guarantees that resource investment will
keep going strongly in the case of the Asian meltdown. If either
the North-West Shelf or the An Feng project were put on hold, the
outlook for WA would change considerably. However, An Feng
Kingstream director John Clark insists that work will begin in
August. The plant, he says, will be at the bottom of the world cost
curve.
	   And he's not worried that Asian investment partners will pull
out. The North-West Shelf partners seem almost as confident. While
the project's Japanese customers have yet to commit to the extra
gas sales, the project partners are confident of obtaining the
letter of intent by the end of this year, in time to meet the
project's original construction schedule.
	   Helping the North-West Shelf partners - and other resource
sector investors - make their sums work will be the depreciation of
the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar has depreciated
against the US dollar by about 11 per cent in the past six months
and almost 19 per cent since the end of 1996. This has cushioned
the Australian-dollar incomes of many Australian mining companies
against the decline of USD-denominated commodity prices.
	   At the same time, WA's mining and other commodity exporters have
been able to weather the Asian downturn more easily than exporters
of consumer goods and capital equipment. That is partly because
commodities are sold on world markets. Lost sales in Asia can be
replaced by sales (albeit at lower prices and with higher transport
costs) in other world markets.
	   When combined with the competitive dollar, the result is that
all but marginal mines can keep producing. And highly efficient new
projects, such as An Feng Kingstream, can still justify
construction. `The iron ore industry is going great because it has
had a rise in the USD contract prices,' Shann points out. `That's
one area where there is going to be a continuing run of activity.'
Nickel is likely to be another. `There's a large number of nickel
projects around,' says Shann. `There are three under construction
that will move into production this year. It's not clear if there
are going to be any replacements, although there are a lot of
projects which claim to be down in the bottom quarter of the cost
curve. Maybe some of them do get up despite the fall in the nickel
price.' But there is another important reason why the WA mining
exports and investment should come through the Asian downturn
reasonably intact. The point was made recently by the governor of
the Reserve Bank of Australia, Ian Macfarlane.
	   To some extent, Australia's food and mining commodity exports
are inputs for Asian export industries. These industries will
benefit from the big depreciation of Asia's currencies in the past
10 months. `We are probably better off in current circumstances
than most suppliers because of the weight of commodities,
foodstuffs and inputs into exports in our mix,' Macfarlane says.
`After the transitional export finance problems are solved, we
should expect to see strong growth in Asian exports as a result of
their large increase in competitiveness.' Of course, WA will not
get off scot-free. Not by a long shot. Take tourism. The tourist
industry has taken a sizable hit. So has the rest of Australia.
Takings by the West Australian accommodation industry in the
December quarter were down in nominal terms on a year earlier, with
the top-end four-star and five-star hotels suffering a 13 per cent
fall in revenue.
	   The Perth property market is also suffering from the financial
pressures on Asian investors. The news recently that Boutique Asset
Pty Ltd, a company connected with the powerful Indonesian Salim
group, was pulling out of plans to develop a A$55m residential
apartment tower in the Perth CBD (central business district)
demonstrates the direct link between sections of the Perth property
market and the prosperity of Asia.
	   Still, neither Asian investors here nor West Australian
officials are particularly worried. Looking ahead, the point to the
Western Australia Treasury forecasts, which predict strong growth
from consumer spending and a recovery in WA's housing investment.
	   Access Economics' Ed Shann, however, warns that the commercial
property market will remain fairly flat. `Basically they haven't
been having much in terms of office construction,' he says. `So,
unlike Sydney, where the property market is starting to kick in,
that won't be a helping hand for Perth. Perth is still basically
dependent on the resource sector.' So, as always in WA, it's back
to the resource sector. But if the Treasury's economists are right,
and the big projects go ahead as planned, the Western Australian
economy could be one of the faster growing economies in Asia in
1998-1999. And the Australian state most exposed to the Asian
crisis could come through with barely a bruising.

New Pentium II-based notebook from Gateway, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

<TEXT>
	   GATEWAY Inc, the direct marketer of personal computer (PC)
products, has introduced its new entry level multimedia notebook
called Solo 2500 which is powered by Intel's Pentium II processors.
	   The notebook replaces the Solo 2300 model, and is targeted at
the heart of the mainstream portable market with its emphasis on
high performance and long battery life.
	   Gateway's marketing director for mobile systems Rick Griencewic
claimed that the Solo 2500 is the most aggressively priced
thin-film transistor (TFT) and Pentium II-based all-in-one notebook
available in the Malaysian market.
	   ``While many of our competitors are struggling to ship their
first Pentium II-based systems, Gateway is already cutting prices
and is pleased to offer a third Pentium II product in its mobile
line of PCs,'' he said.
	   Griencewic said the Pentium II technology in mobile PCs delivers
between 11 to 32 per cent better performance at the same thermal
level of a 166 megahertz (MHz) multimedia extensions (MMX)
technology.
	   Gateway's Solo notebooks may be customised to custom-configure
the central processing unit (CPU) speed, random access memory (RAM)
amount, hard drive capacity, modem and network connectivity,
operating system and applications software to meet individual
requirements.
	   ``The Solo notebooks can be upgraded or downgraded to meet
individual requirements and budget,'' said Griencewic.
	   Priced at RM8,498, the Solo 2500 is configured with a 200MHz
Pentium processor with MMX technology, 32-megabyte (MB) SD random
access memory (RAM), 12.2-inch TFT display, two-gigabyte (GB) hard
disk, fibre distributed data (FDD), 56K PC card fax modem and
lithium-ion battery. It includes a CD-ROM and floppy drive which
eliminate the need to swap components.
	   It also allows sharing of components such as docking stations,
system memory, hard disk drives, power adapters and other common
peripherals.
	   Gateway said the Solo 2500 has added manageability features to
lower the total cost of ownership through its common modularity
strategy.
	   For example, the LANDesk Client Management with Windows NT and
SM basic input/output system (BIOS) allows a company's information
systems department to manage company notebooks from remote sites.
	   In addition, users can choose between a touchpad or
stick-pointing device. This allows business users to standardise
with one portable system and yet meet their personal preferences.
	   Gateway's director of marketing for South Asia Niall O'Reilly
said by introducing the Solo 2500 to the Malaysian market via the
DirectPlus business model, Gateway has reaffirmed its commitment as
the value leader in the local notebook market.
	   The company's direct channel model strategy means that customers
deal directly with the principal manufacturer and everything is
built specifically to order, thus eliminating the middleman.
	   It also enables Gateway to offer an attractive package which
combines good pricing and the latest PC technologies available in
the market.

	   IT SO RANKLED this writer in school all those years ago when a
colleague, who shall remain anonymous, insisted on giving his
mouthful-of-a-name in all its `triple-barelled glory'. Nothing
really wrong with that except he was a fellow `Melayu' and to this
far-from-wordly-wise teenager then, a Malay name had to conform to
a simple convention. It was basically Abdul `this' bin Abdul `that'
or Mohamad `this' bin Mohamad `that'. The snooty friend, instead,
insisted on including a surname to his already unwieldy first and
second names. `Its my family name,' he implored earnestly, almost
on the verge of tears on being pressured by his hectoring
interlocutors. Only now, having picked up the book The Merican Clan
- A Story of Courage and Destiny which chronicles the achievements
of seven generations of Mericans, the progeney of Kader Mydin
Merican who first set foot in Penang from India in 1770, does one
appreciate his stubborn insistence. Thanks to the pride attached in
carrying the Merican family name with each succeeding generations,
the task of tracing lineage can be undertaken with a great measure
of certainty and accuracy. Forgive me, my friend?
	   This writer's first ever inkling of the existence of a Merican
was via the airwaves in the days when Radio 4 was called Rangkaian
Biru. Every Sunday, one would look forward to the afternoon radio
play and inevitably a Merican - Faridah Merican - would come on air
as a principal character.
	   Later on, news items would chronicle one achievement or other
with yet another Merican, invariably bathed in academic or
corporate glory. Names like Mahmood Merican, Malek Merican and
Ahmad Merican all hit the headlines for achieving one notable
success or another but little thought was given to the significance
of that Merican family name. After all, one came from a culture
where geneology and tracing one's family tree is limited to knowing
the name of one's moyang and no further. However, the regularity
with which this particular family name cropped up and the import of
their achievements did raise a measure of envious curiosity. Now
thanks to Datin Ragayah Eusoff, the blanket of ignorance is lifted.
(She's married to Mahmood Merican, so that explains this particular
labour of love!) Interestingly, Mahmood - the Datuk Dr Mahmood who
was once chairman of Pantai Hospital - wasn't too keen on his
wife's idea and mischievously suggested she write a book about
Mericans who were already dearly departed! With great aplomb,
Ragayah ignored his helpful suggestion.
	   Why should the reader be interested in the Mericans in the first
place?
	   We should, if only because we take vicarious delight in sharing
the success stories of others. In the case of the Mericans, the
exploits of various clan members should by now confer on them the
right to patent the formula for superachieving families - if the
bunch of medical men and learned women as well as earnest
entrepreneurs from their ranks have not already done so.
	   Patriarch Kader Mydin Merican was a trader who became one of the
richest men in the Penang of the 1830s. That he eminence grise in
the Indian Muslim community was acknowledged by the British who
appointed him Kapitan Keling. The fourth generation Merican
produced the clan's first doctor, Ali Osman Merican. `Oss', as he
was called, was in fact Penang's first Malay doctor. A sibling,
Sheikh Basha, was an educator who was instrumental in establishing
and heading Rida College, the forerunner of what is now the
Institute Teknologi Mara (ITM). Thespian Faridah Merican is his
daughter.
	   The recipe for eminence cannot wholly be explained by way of
geneology.
	   Marina Yusoff, the country's second Malay woman lawyer who at
one time landed an Umno Supreme Council seat, is a clan member. Her
mother Mona was Dr Ali Merican's adopted daughter.
	   The exploits of past and present Mericans have secured the clan
an indelible page in the annals of Malaysian history. The author
hints of more new pages to be written in her observation that there
are 16 great-grandchildren of Dr Ali Merican making up the seventh
generation Merican.
	   That they are not yet making waves is no reason why one of their
number should not start chronicling every mewling and chuckling
emanating from every crib in all the Merican households. Failing
which, there is always that famous family name one can latch on to
in future undertakings of this nature.

	   THE highly-acclaimed television programme Sesame Street has now
entered the realm of interactive technology. The Sesame Street
Toddlers Deluxe comes bundled with three compact disks (CDs) and no
prizes for guessing what they do. Those of you who grew up watching
the Street programme will surely remember the days when you learnt
to recite your ABCs, count your 123s and dance to the tune of
Do-Re-Me together with the furry, memorable, cuddly creations from
the late Jim Henson's workshop.
	   But what makes this software package delightful is that it
continues the Street's legacy of portraying the same zestful and
eccentric ensemble of muppets.
	   And doing what it does best, which is educating and entertaining
young viewers, this package offers pre-school children the choice
of a variety of learning activities ranging from recognising
letters and numbers to rhyming and art work.
	   Watch your kids get mesmerised by the eye-catching interface as
Elmo (my personal favourite) guides them to learning the rudiments
of knowledge.
	   Along the way, introduce them to a ``star-studded'' cast of
muppets like the nasal-voiced Grover and the ever-deliciously
wicked Street inhabitant known as Oscar the Grouch, who, for some
reason, has this inane attachment to his dumpster and develops
insecurities whenever having to leave it.
	   Then, there's the mismatched pair, Ernie and Bert, the misfit
Cookie Monster and of course, the one-and-only Big Bird.
	   Young viewers may not know this but parents who ardently follow
the Street TV show, might recognise some similarities with the way
the whole teaching processes here are being presented. While
reviewing this software, I felt like I was watching the TV series
all over again.
	   And be prepared for some pretty witty scripts. Children (and
parents alike) will be tickled pink to hear the usual banter,
spiced with a dash of humour of course between Ernie and Bert as
you pay these guys a visit.
	   Or have your child rummage through Snuffleupagus' and Big Bird's
homes to uncover the essential items that one is asked to look for.
And if you simply want to take a break, how about listening to some
songs?
	   Interested? Want to know more?
	   Well, Disk One unveils a series of activities covering areas
like art and colouring using stickers and rubber stamps. Or how
about creating slide shows from selected pictures? Here, children
are exposed to verbal instructions and by following them, they can
gradually pick up the basics of computer skills. After the
``getting-to-know-your-PC'' exercise, Disk Two then introduces
toddlers to the alphabet, phonics and rhyming with the aim to
helping children slowly develop their vocabulary skills.
	   And surprise! surprise! There are even classic videos excerpts
and songs from the TV show to add fun and variety.
	   Feel like moving on? Well, there's Disk Three which progresses
to the more difficult part of the learning process. There are
lessons on numbers and games to play, in addition to songs to sing
along to and storytelling.
	   Help Count von Count find his bats in his castle and learn all
about addition and subtraction.
	   And parents, are you looking for comprehensive educational CDs
that are worth your time and money?
	   Why not give Sesame Street Toddlers Deluxe a try. And who knows,
someday when that familiar Street tune is played, your child will
sit back and say, ``Hey, that really brings back memories''.

<TEXT>
	   AS non-programmable analogue joysticks go, I have never come
across something as versatile as Rockfire's Bazooka Fighter. Though
Bazooka is not the sort of name I would have given it, the features
added to the joystick are by far some of the most innovative.
	   To begin with, the joystick is designed to be a chameleon of
sorts because it is capable of mimicking the functions or behaviour
of more than one type of joystick design. Generally speaking, it
looks like any other high-end and intermediately priced joystick,
except that is has a curious-looking function on the left side of
its solid-looking base marked Mode 1234. It is a slider switch
which allows the gamer to determine how the Bazooka is supposed to
behave.
	   In mode 1, the Bazooka mimics the functions of the ThrustMaster
FCS, from the four button fire control, to the viewfinder or hat
switch, right down to its precision handling. The joystick throttle
is disabled in order to avoid unwanted conflicts with an actual
ThrustMaster's throttle control unit. Just add a rudder control
unit to the Bazooka and ThrustMaster throttle, and the gamer should
have a combination that is ready for almost any true-to-life flight
simulator that requires high-precision handling.
	   In mode 2, the Bazooka behaves like a CH Flightstick Pro.
However, unlike the CH Flightstick, the throttle control for the
Bazooka is not at the base but at the upper right side of the
joystick grip. This would allow the gamer to fully dedicate his
left hand (the Bazooka being a right-handed joystick) to keyboard
commands.
	   It is surprising that joystick makers had not come up with the
idea sooner seeing how the need for the gamer's left hand to travel
from joystick to keyboard can be ``fatal'' in most fast-paced and
gruelling games, thus defeating the purpose of having throttle
control on the joystick. Well, not only has that problem been
solved, the Bazooka's throttle control is a special push-button
analogue unit that is not only easily accessible but can also be
``auto-centred'', a feature necessary for ensuring efficiency in
games like Descent and Descent II. No longer does a gamer have to
worry about over-thrusting using that silly old slide or rotary
switch.
	   By moving the Mode 1234 switch to any position while holding
down the throttle, the auto-centre feature would be enabled. And
moving just the Mode switch would disable that feature. It is as
simple as that.
	   The only problem I faced with the throttle design was that it
was not placed high enough, but this is not a problem that would be
shared by most gamers unless they are adults with stubby hands and
inflexible thumbs. I guess, for me, the cramps from having to bend
my thumb a little more than what feels natural, would just take
some getting use to. I just hope I do not get any bunions from it.
	   In mode 3, the Bazooka behaves like an arcade joystick with two
single fire and two turbo fire buttons capable of producing 15
signals per second, as well as throttle control. And in mode 4, the
gamer will get four single fire buttons and a throttle control.
	   Now, whilst the Bazooka is not about to replace sophisticated
game pads in modes 3 and 4, it does have an advantage over them
because of the throttle control. This feature would be most useful
in arcade games that require two joysticks. To fully enable it,
select the two joystick modes supported by the particular game and
calibrate the joystick as instructed by the game manual concerned.
Note, however, that the functioning of buttons C and D as well as
the throttle control in modes 3 and 4 are dependent on the dual
joystick mode.
	   If at any point the joystick does not respond as it should under
the various modes when playing through Windows 95, the user should
see whether the particular mode corresponds to what has been set
under the control panel of Windows 95.
	   Personally, I had not encountered such problems when reviewing
the Bazooka, but the control panel would have been the first place
that I looked at had I encountered such a problem. Apart from all
that, the Bazooka looks really chic and provides for a generally
comfortable grip.
	   Its wide handrest at the base of the grip allows for greater
precision handling as well as alleviates wrist cramps. Of course,
all this is relative to the user's general size, but as far as I
can tell, my ``kill rates'' have generally gone up.
	   So I guess this is one joystick I would be happy to have since
it distributes stress to the whole of my arm instead of
concentrating it on my wrist or elbow. I guess that is why the
Bazooka marketers referred to it as ``ergonomic in design''. It has
a wide and heavy base with no obtrusive slide controls for
alignment error correction to mar its sleekness. Those alignment
controls are placed underneath the base which not only makes the
joystick look better but ensures that any accidental adjustments
are avoided. What more, it comes with a 183-centimetre cable.
	   Now, if only someone had thought of a better name than Bazooka!

	   THE softening demand for cars in the face of the current
economic downturn has been a humbling experience for Edaran
Otomobil Nasional Bhd (EON), the distributor of the national car.
In the past, buyers had to grit their teeth when faced with the
`non-option' of having to purchase Proton cars complete with
`optional accessories'. Now they can buy the `no-frills' Proton
Iswara 1.3 litre Aeroback which, with excise duty, sales tax and
air-conditioner but minus all the other extras, is some RM9,000
cheaper! This has attracted so many customers that EON is expecting
to celebrate a milestone this month - its millionth sale. New
customers can also enjoy reduced interest rates on car loans, from
10 per cent to 9.5 per cent.
	   Roll on, customer number 1,000,000.

	   GLORIOUS church bells and beautiful orchestra music welcome
everyone to another exciting Disney adventure! Those are the bells
of Notre Dame and so begins a story behind those chimes - Disney's
Animated StoryBook: The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
	   The story begins with Quasimodo, a meek and mild hunchback.
Frollo, a cruel and wicked man, raised him. He lives in the Notre
Dame cathedral and, at Frollo's instructions, does not wander
outside the cathedral.
	   Everyday he watches life passing below in the streets,
especially during the gala and whimsical Festival of Fools.
	   The Festival of Fools is an annual event that parades the
silliest performances for the year as the crowd looks for a person
who has the ugliest face to be crowned as king of the festival.
	   Quasimodo is sad as he cannot attend the festival but his
gargoyle friends Hugo, Victor and Laverne have other plans.
	   With encouragement from these friends, Quasimodo climbs down the
cathedral and mingles with the people at the Festival of Fools.
Here, he meets two new friends in Esmeralda, a gypsy woman and
Phoebus, an army captain, and is crowned the king of the festival
by the crowd.
	   Frightened and scared by the fruits thrown by the crowd, he
flees back to Notre Dame followed unknowingly by Esmeralda. Phoebus
follows her into Notre Dame to help her to escape the clutches of
Frollo but Frollo himself soon discovers this.
	   However, Frollo cannot capture her as she has sought sanctuary
in the cathedral. In the dark of the night, Quasimodo helps
Esmeralda escape by climbing down the cathedral. Later, Quasimodo
overhears that Frollo and his soldiers are going to raid the secret
Court of Miracles and capture all the gypsies hiding there. Off go
Quasimodo and Phoebus in their quest to find the secret Court and
warn of the dangers that lie ahead.
	   To play the game, merely click on the hero to go directly to the
story.
	   Otherwise, click on Clopin the puppet to learn to play together.
Clopin will then take you to a Choice Screen with a range of
options.
	   To read and play with the story, click on the picture of Hugo
and Victor together. Your kids could also sit back and relax as the
story is read to them by clicking the picture of Victor reading a
storybook.
	   To go straight to your favourite part of the story, click on the
picture of Laverne and the pigeons. Or else, click on the picture
of Hugo juggling to play the fun-filled games. Your kids can use
the tomato cursor to move around the screen and to click on an
object.
	   Two things I like the most about this animated storybook are the
exciting games and musical scores. Firstly, your kids will get the
chance to play the Bells Game. They will learn to cheer up
Quasimodo by composing some songs and dancing some numbers for him.
Click on any of the eight coloured bells in the Bell Tower to
create a sequence of musical sounds.
	   As each sound is played, the gargoyle at the centre of the stage
will do the twist, roll, raise his hands up and down and sideways
and swing his hips. Clicking on the scroll above the stage saves
the song sheets. You can also select any gargoyle that you want to
perform on stage by clicking on that particular gargoyle and
dragging him to the centre of the stage.
	   There is also a game called Tightrope walker.
	   Here your kids need to help Jacques the Magnificent to walk
safely across the tightrope by balancing the number of chickens on
both sides of the pole he carries. Help is also vital to guide Hugo
to stop the soldiers from getting to the top of the cathedral by
dropping boxes on the soldiers as they climb up the ladders.
	   Sing-alongs can be heard in the Festival of Fools. Your kids
will be invited to sing along with Clopin and the band by following
the bouncing chickens.
	   There are three different songs provided at the banner located
at the right side of the screen. Your kids will enjoy many more
games that are included here. It's enough to keep any young one
engrossed for hours.

Westwood holds off Clarke by a stroke to win TPC of Europe

<TEXT>
	   ALVESLOHE, Germany (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood Monday sank a
clutch birdie on his final hole to hold off Darren Clarke at the
TPC of Europe and capture his second title of the year.
	   Westwood, the 25-year-old Ryder Cup player, holed a 20-foot putt
(7 meters) to capture the dlrs 1.9 million event by a shot after
letting a four-stroke lead melt way.
	   ``It's the biggest putt of the week, because I finally managed
to close the door,'' said Westwood.
	   Westwood, who fired a course record 61 Sunday, finished with a
66 and 23-under 265 to win his first tournament in Europe this
season, having earlier won on the other side of the Atlantic at the
Freeport McDermott Classic held in New Orleans.
	   Clarke made a late charge by stringing four birdies together as
the Northern Ireland player finished with a round of 68 and a 266
total.
	   Masters champion Mark O'Meara, who also chased Clarke was third
at 269 and a final round 70. He shot himself out of contention with
a 11th hole double bogey.
	   After taking what seemed to be a sure four-stroke lead into the
16th, Westwood appeared to be hit by nerves as Clarke's birdie run
mounted.
	   He missed an eight-foot putt on the 16th for his first bogey of
the day, then struggled to play even on the 17th.
	   ``It's difficult when a player like Clarke is chasing you. He
can birdie every hole,'' said Westwood.
	   But Clarke failed to position himself for another birdie on his
approach shot on the par-5 17th, while Westwood launched a perfect
shot down the center of the fairway on his final hole.
	   ``That's a great drive,'' said Mark O'Meara, Westwood's playing
partner, in his first European tournament since winning his green
jacket in Augusta.
	   Westwood said final two rounds of 61 and 66 were the best of his
five-year career.
	   ``It's the first time I've ever done that _ hopefully it's not
the last,'' said Westwood.
	   Bernhard Langer finished with a 68 and 271, along with Ireland's
Philip Walton. The German, a two-time winner of the tournament,
also knocked himself out of contention with a double bogey on his
second hole.
	   ``You just want to stick your head in the sand _ I'm very happy
with my round after that,'' said Langer, still searching for his
first title this season.
	   The scores, although low, were nothing compared to Sunday's
third round when Westwood shattered the course record by two
strokes and O'Meara matched it.
	   ``I'm surprised the scores weren't better. Maybe we used up all
the birdies yesterday,'' said Walton, whose fourth-place finish
came after he missed five straight cuts.
	   Westwood took home dlrs 298,804 for his third career title on
the European tour.

German minister says German-Russians returning home not burden 
</HEADLINE>
By BIRGIT BRAUER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Ethnic Germans returning home from the
former Soviet Union are not placing a burden on Germany's pension
system, the country's labor minister said Monday.
	   Most of the returnees are young people taking jobs that most
Germans would refused to accept, Norbert Bluem said following a
three-day visit to Kazakstan.
	   There has been heated debate in Germany about the ``Aussiedler''
from the former Soviet Union who are entitled to pensions because
of their ethnic roots, even though the never contributed to the
pension fund.
	   ``The debate about Aussiedler causing financial problems for the
German pension system is not only wrong, it it also stupid because
it nurtures resentment,'' Bluem said.
	   The German Labor Ministry says only 11 percent of ethnic German
returning from the former Soviet Union are over 60 years of age,
compared with 21 percent of Germany's total population.
	   However, 33 percent of the returnees are children or teen-agers,
compared with 19 percent of Germany's population.
	   Germans went to Russia about 200 years ago at the invitation of
the German-born Empress Catherine the Great who granted them land,
religious freedom and other special privileges in return for
helping to modernize the country.
	   During World War II, Stalin ordered all ethnic Germans in the
lower Volga region deported to Siberia and Central Asia as
potential traitors. Thousands died in labor camps or coal mines.
	   Germans started leaving the former Soviet Union during Mikhail
Gorbachev's perestroika reforms in the late 1980s. Since 1989, the
number of Germans in Kazakstan has fallen by 75 percent, from
around 1 million to 250,000 today.
	   In recent years, Germany has tried to persuade ethnic Germans to
stay where they are, because of its high unemployment rate and
ballooning federal deficit.

	   IT is very rare to come across an organisation which can afford
to start off with a completely automated system. Hotel chains may
be able to start off with an integrated private automatic branch
exchange (PABX) system which ensures that telephone calls are
recorded, and printed rather than linked with the billing system,
and where the cash register in the restaurant downstairs is also
linked to the billing system. For most companies, however, growth
is gradual and incremental.
	   Generally, components stand alone and function individually.
Then they are pulled into a functioning system. For example, if you
are running a new company, you might plan on building an intranet
in two years' time. At the moment you can't afford to invest in all
the equipment, your staff aren't trained and you have not generated
the amount of resources (paperwork, etc.) to make it worth such an
investment in any case.
	   Therefore, you might decide to buy a PC and some software which
will help with specific jobs, such as accounting. This gives your
staff time to become used to dealing with computers.
	   When the time for building your intranet comes, you will
probably have to invest in enhancing your machines but hopefully
you will have kept staff accustomed to dealing with computers,
accumulated enough resources to make using an intranet worthwhile
and invested in enough equipment to keep development costs low.
	   When investing in standalone equipment look to your future needs
and consider investing in equipment with capabilities beyond your
present requirements. For example, when buying a cash register for
your new hotel, you might want to invest in a machine which
generates information which is not used yet, such as an electronic
cash register which is capable of integrating point of sale with
invoicing and inventory packages.
	   When automating a factory, you might choose to buy a robot which
paints cars which is capable of linking to your inventory and
production assessment systems but which for the first year is used
only for painting with human operators assessing inventory and
production schedules. The first year you will only use part of the
machine's capabilities but when it comes to pulling together your
equipment into a computer network, you will have the right tool in
place.
	   Be careful if you are investing in equipment where the
technology is changing rapidly. If standards have not been
developed you may find yourself investing in equipment which
becomes obsolete before you are ready to proceed to systems
integration. To avoid such problems, assess the current and future
situation with vendors and consultants. As a general rule of thumb,
many people recommend not to adopt technology which is less than
two years old.
	   When planning ahead, consider the facilities necessary to your
future needs. For example, if you are installing a telephone system
and investing in standalone computers, you might want to add in the
infrastructure necessary for your planned local area network (LAN).
When installing a PABX system you have to install wiring cables in
the walls and ceilings to connect each telephone. Save future
remodelling costs by installing network cable for your LAN on the
same path at the same time.
	   One of the costs of implementing information technology (IT) is
acquiring trained users. Training can be expensive and keeping
trained staff can be more difficult still in times of labour
shortages. Paying trained staff premium wages will significantly
reduce your training costs and keep your production level high.
	   With evolving technology, training has become a vital success
factor to the implementation of new systems and applications. Today
it is no longer valid to put training off until the economic
climate is more stable, nor is it cost-effective to send a large
group of employees on general training sessions.
	   Be prepared to have an ongoing training budget and use your
training provision as a selling point in your marketing or
recruitment. Consider the pros and cons of hiring staff straight
out of technical college compared to hiring staff with experience
but without the technological skills you need.

	   DO YOU WANT everyone in your office to share information
instantly? Do you want to provide marketing and sales support,
disseminate training materials and schedules quickly and cheaply?
Do you dream about a system where collaboration means all members
share and have immediate access to all necessary resources?
	   If so, you need an office computer network. Computer networks
allow you to banish resource hogging corporate documents that are
now produced on paper like human resources guides, office and phone
directories, parts and price information, newsletters, annual
reports, maps, company facilities and product information
literature. Computer networks allow you to store, manipulate and
disseminate information quickly and cheaply.
	   Local area networks A Local Area Network (LAN) is a computer
network where computers are linked by a cable. Local area networks
are often used by companies to allow members to share files and
applications.
	   In a network one set of computers asks another computer for
files and services. The computer which asks for the files or
services is called the client. The computer which provides the
files or services is the server.
	   The Network Operating System (NOS) ties a client to a server.
Servers can provide, store and transfer files, access other
servers, organise e-mail, printing queues etc.
	   LANs allow everyone to share a printer and a file server, saving
the company considerable investment costs. Adding an application
server means everyone can share software packages. This means that
you need not invest in expensive PCs as everyone can use cheaper
'dumb terminals' - computers without memories or processors which
access the servers and keep documents stored there. With the
appropriate software, LANs also support local e-mail between users
and share modems among workstations.
	   Sounds good? There is one big disadvantage: sharing applications
can be expensive in terms of software licenses. When you use an
application server, you can either buy a licence for each client,
or you can invest in more software which regulates how many clients
can use the package. Either way, when using branded products,
licensing costs can rise very quickly.
	   Enter the intranet This problem has been overcome by newer
technology. Intranets are LANs which use Internet technology. Where
a LAN is accessed through a file manager, an intranet is accessed
through a browser. What does this mean?
	   An intranet is based on the World Wide Web (WWW) model. The WWW
categorises resources by URL, Universal Resource Locators, which
are then referred to as links within a `web page'. When you click
on a hyperlink, there is always an underlying URL that transports
you to `another place' on the web containing various resources, eg,
text, video, images etc. Your browser recognises what form
information is stored in by the MIME (multipurpose Internet mail
extensions) type and/or the file extension, and automatically does
whatever is necessary to display the contents of the document.
	   The technology used in browsers is extremely user friendly, just
requiring users to `point and click' their way to resources. HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), the `native' language of the WWW, is a
simple programming language and there are many software packages
offering shortcuts to web page design if users want to build extra
resources.
	   The web browser is, in effect, a `container' for a compound
document. A compound document has several elements, which can
include images, music, or even entire programs. The browser
co-ordinates these elements to display the document.
	   Another huge advantage is that the underlying structure of
intranets (called a platform) is very flexible. Intranets rely on
two formats which transmit data between linked computers. One is
called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the other is
Internet Protocol (IP). Working together they form the TCP/IP
platform. This platform allows all different types of computers and
computer networks to communicate with each other.
	   Using TCP/IP it doesn't matter which network operating system
anyone is using as web browsers are designed to read the data on
all types of platforms. You can access information stored on a
`Mac' as easily as information stored on a Unix machine. This means
that you have no problem integrating inherited machines with newly
acquired machines in your office. Redundancy costs are reduced
significantly.
	   How to set up an intranet If you don't already have a local area
network, you need to set one up.
	   This requires computers, wiring, a NOS, and a network interface
card which connects the wiring to the NOS.
	   To turn your LAN into an intranet you need to make sure that you
have the appropriate software to display HTML files, TCP/IP
communication and, if necessary, multimedia. In other words, you
need a browser, assorted software and perhaps sound and video
cards. You can choose to invest in software or download freeware
from the internet.
	   There are two different types of wiring which can be used to set
up LANs. One uses coaxial cable which looks like the cable which
goes to your TV antenna. The other uses twisted pair wiring which
looks like fat telephone wires. The coaxial cable generally
connects all the machines on the network on a single bus or line.
This is generally called a bus.(Refer to Diagram 1.) The twisted
pair wire uses a hub, a traffic intersection which directs traffic
from one point to another in an intranet. This type of network is
generally called a star. (Refer to Diagram 2.) Bus topologies used
to be popular because they were cheaper to set up.
	   In the last few years, star topologies have become more popular
because their price has gone down and they are more flexible.
	   Connecting intranets to make extranets A strategic use of
intranets is to link your information network to that of your
business partners. This is called an extranet. To do this you need
a firewall to prevent unauthorised access.
	   A client who wants to connect to the outside world has to go
through the server to connect to the router, a traffic intersection
which directs traffic from one point to another between an intranet
and the outside world. When the server and router are configured to
examine traffic before allowing requests and information to pass,
then the client is deemed to go through a firewall. An extranet can
be defined as a firewall to firewall connection between intranets.
(Refer to Diagram 3.) In other words, requests from your sister
company will be allowed through, but requests from strangers will
not be allowed through.
	   Development considerations When taking decisions concerning
computer networks, consider the following points.
	   First, decide which materials should be put online first and
which materials can be added gradually. Everyone will have
different priorities and it may take some time to come to a
decision.
	   Second, ensure that information is not altered without
authorisation.
	   You may consider asking each author or department to be
responsible for their own set of resources.
	   Third, once the system is online, consideration must be given to
training users to develop new materials. Developing materials for
LANs will mean product training for developers. If you choose to
run an intranet you may choose to use authoring software which
converts documents automatically to HTML format. You may also ask
your technical department to make up various templates which can be
used to put new information online while keeping the same look and
feel as the existing system.
	   Templates are a particularly useful device when putting
regularly generated information online such as quarterly reports
and so forth.
	   Fourth, to ensure that the look and feel of the system remains
the same even if the original developers leave, write a highly
detailed style guide. Make sure that the style guide is adhered to

	   MARKET sentiment remained soft as evidenced by a persistent and
slow downward push. The conclusion of the RHB-Sime Bank deal on
April 23 was insufficient for the market to recover. However, it
did allay earlier concerns on the funding aspect. RHB will purchase
Sime Bank for RM368 million after disposing six subsidiaries. The
Petronas-MISC-Konsortium deal was concluded on April 30. However,
there were also corporate deals which failed to be concluded such
as the reverse takeover of Ayamas.
	   Concerns on the uncertainties of the overall market continues to
be a nagging factor. MAS has yet to announce its restructuring as
at May 4.
	   Omega Securities has been suspended from trading until its
minimum liquid funds is fulfilled. And there is a mixed feeling on
the raising of the foreign equity stake to 61 per cent from 49 per
cent for the telecommunications sector. However, the stake must be
reduced back to 49 per cent within five years.
	   Money supply M3 for March moderated to 13.7 per cent year on
year. This slower money supply growth is worrisome as it suggests
the economy is slowing.
	   On the warrants market, an interesting development relating to
extending their expiry dates has created excitement in a rather
dull market. It started off with Apex-W, expiring on June 27 1998,
being granted an extension of another year to June 27 1999 by the
Securities Commission.
	   This was followed by the proposal for TA-W to extend its
maturity date from Nov 22, 1998 to May 22, 1999. The precedent for
extending the warrant maturity date was set by UCB-T when it was
given an extension from July 31, 1997 to Dec 17, 1997.
	   In Apex-W case, it is restoring the duration of the warrant to
the normal five years from the current four years. Similarly, TA-W
of 4.5 years is seeking for an extension to five years. However,
IOIPB-W and K HIN-W, both of four year duration, will expire on
their maturity dates with no extension as they are due to expire in
May.
	   However, it is wrong to assume that all warrants of less than a
five-year duration will automatically be extended. There may be
speculation on an extra time period for warrants currently of less
than a five-year duration. The bet is for the market to improve and
hopefully, warrants will be exercised to pay off bond holders.
Rating Agency Malaysia estimates some RM3 billion bond issues with
warrants will mature in 1998.
	   Warrants are sweeteners to attract subscribers to corporate
bonds. The idea is for investors to exercise the warrants, ie
converting to mother shares. With the cash raised, the corporation
can pay off the bond holders. The drop in the share market has
upset this idea as the warrant exercise prices are above that of
the mother shares. It is cheaper to buy mother shares than to
convert. A warrant is thus basically a bull market instrument.
	   On the extension of the existing warrants to the five-year
duration, the impact will be more on the warrant prices than on the
mother shares. This will increase the time premium component of the
warrant valuation. Based on the Blacksholes pricing model, adjusted
to five years for those of less than 4.5 years, warrant prices
improve. This would probably provide the opportunity for warrant
holders to cut losses.
	   On the technical side, the outlook has not changed as it
continues to mark time. This must be sounding wordy by now as I
continue to hold on to the bullish technical view. The slide in the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index from the February high
of 764.94 points has not negated the bullish view yet as the 470.43
point low of January has not been violated; the current probability
suggests that it is unlikely to be breached.
	   On the relative strength index (RSI), it bounced off the lower
trendline support at 28; it is currently moving towards the upper
trend channel. An upside breach of the RSI resistance of 31 will
reverse the uptrend.
	   Immediate support is at 611 points. The next support is at 582
points which is a 61.8 per cent retracement from 764.94 to 470.43
points, followed by 565 points.
	   Resistance is at 647 points then 677. The next level is 742
points.

	   IN the last article, we examined background printing and the
wrapping feature in Microsoft Word's Clip-Art pictures.
	   Wrapping allows you to control the text-picture alignment which
is important for the aesthetic appeal of the entire document.
Today, we will examine this wrapping feature further.
	   Once you have inserted the ClipArt picture, invoke Format -)
Picture.
	   Click on the Wrapping tab.
	   You will see the options Square, Tight, Through, None and Top
and Bottom. Below these, you will see another set of options
labelled: Both sides, Left, Right and Largest side.
	   These options help to fine tune the picture-text alignment and
set the distance of the text from the edges of the picture.
	   These options become active (i.e. can be used) only when you
choose Square, Tight and Through.
	   Let's suppose you want the text to flow in such a manner that
the distance of the text from the left edge of the picture is
greater than the distance of the text from the right edge.
	   First, create some text and then insert a ClipArt picture in the
middle of the text. Use Format -) Picture (Wrapping tab) to get
wrapping options.
	   Click on Square in the Wrapping Style options. Then, click on
both sides in the Wrap to set off options. Choose `1''' in the
spinner labelled left: this will create one inch of space between
the picture's left border and the text.
	   Similarly, use the spinner labelled right to alter the distance
between the text and the right border of the picture.
	   If you were to set the spinner at 0.3-inch, there will be
0.3-inch of space between the picture's right border and the text.
	   You can get unusual but very appealing effects by using
different settings for the right and left spinners. Sometimes, you
can get a very elegant look by adding borders around the ClipArt
Picture. Use the Format -) Picture command and click on the Colours
and Lines tab.
	   You will see three vertically stacked areas labelled: Fill, Line
and Arrows. Almost the entire dialogue box is in subdued grey
because a number of the features, such as arrows, are not
applicable to ClipArt.
	   Only the Fill (Colour) and Line (Colour) pulldown menus are
active.
	   The default settings on the Fill colour and Line colour menus
are No Fill and No Line respectively.
	   To add a blue border around the ClipArt picture, click on the
menu arrowhead in Line. Choose Blue from the colour palette.
	   This has the effect of drawing a blue border around your ClipArt
picture. When you enter a particular colour in the pulldown menu,
the rest of the features in the Line area become active because
they become relevant options. These are Dashed, Style and Weight.
	   Dashed allows you to choose a particular pattern for your
border.
	   Options include a series of little diamonds, dots, dashes and so
on.
	   If you were to choose Blue for Colour and the dots for Style,
you will get a border of blue dots. The Style menu allows you to
choose several types of patterns for the border.
	   Options include thick double lines or a thick and a thin double
line and so on. For instance, you can get a nice effect where the
ClipArt picture appears to be nestled in a frame when you choose
the last option in the Style pulldown menu, namely a thick line
nestled within two thin lines.
	   You can alter the thickness of the border by changing the
settings on the Weight menu. A larger number causes a thicker line.
	   Another trick that enhances the appearance of your ClipArt
picture is the presence of the Fill colour.
	   The colour menu in the Fill area allows you to add a colour of
your choice to the space between the Clip Art picture and the
border created by the Line menu.
	   You need to choose the appropriate colour from the Fill (colour)
menu.
	   Once you have chosen a particular colour, the small checkbox
titled semi- transparent will become active.
	   When you click on this box, the colour in the fill area will
take on a lighter, somewhat transparent hue. This hue goes very
well with darker coloured lines for the borders.
	   You can add a very classy look to your Clip-Art picture by using
the special fill effects Fill (Colour) and patterned line effects
in Line (Colour).
	   The Fill (Colour) pulldown menu has an option labelled Fill
effects.
	   This allows you to choose a combination of various hues for the
background; such as a lighter hue at the top which darkens
progressively to the bottom.
	   You can choose from several different effects. Similarly, the
Line (Colour) pulldown menu has the option Patterned Lines.
	   This allows you to choose from options such as bubbles,
crosswires, brickwalls, and so on.
	   The ClipArt feature offers numerous enhancement possibilities.
By trying out different combinations of Special Fill Effects and
Patterned Lines, it is possible to obtain outstanding results.
	   You should experiment freely with various Colours, Styles and
Weights in the Line options for the borders.
	   Then, you should experiment with the different Fill colours and
fill effects and examine your work with the semi-transparent
feature.
	   You must be careful that your choice of colours for the borders
match well with the choice of colours for the lines. For example,
dark blue borders with a light blue fill colour give a pleasant
look while dark blue borders and a dark blue fill colour may cause
your borders to become invisible.

	   AMONG THE 27 states in Brazil, one stands out eminently. While
the national exports grew at a rate of 18 per cent for 1996, the
industries in Rio Grande Do Sol managed better at 26.2 per cent.
	   The federation of industries (the Brazilian equivalent to the
Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers) in most states of Brazil,
with the exception of Sao Paulo, do not even have a building of
their own.
	   But in Rio Grande Do Sul, the federation of industries has a
large headquarters with a state-of-the-arts convention centre which
often attracts symphony orchestras from musically-inclined
countries like Austria. Though many industries in Rio Grande Do Sul
would prefer to attribute this success to their competitiveness,
the key to this prosperity lies with Mercosur, the incipient
customs union that stimulates trade between four countries.
	   Though not as big as the European Union (EU), Mercosur is the
most effective trade block in Latin America at present and its
objectives almost similar to the European body. Besides Brazil, the
other three members of Mercosur are Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay. Chile and Bolivia stand at the fringes as associate
members.
	   With the formation of Mercosur in 1990, Rio Grande Do Sul found
itself in a strategic position of being located at the hub of the
customs union.
	   Thus, the state became the gateway for the exchange of trade
between Brazil, the biggest economic power in South America and its
Mercosur partners.
	   `When the idea of Mercosur was first mooted, everyone thought
the state was doomed as it will have to compete with
agriculture-dominated economies of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
But while the argriculture sector of the state faced competition,
the other sectors of the economy like manufacturing and heavy
industries prospered,' says Florence Rosa, the director of
international affairs for the state of Rio Grande Do Sul.
	   Rosa says the formation of Mercosur enables industries in
Brazil, especially from Rio Grande Do Sul, to market their products
to more than 200 million people. The combined gross domestic
product of the Mercosur countries is more than US$1.2 billion.
	   The ultimate objective of Mercosur is to be a trade block
encompassing all the countries in Latin America. The trade block
also hopes to achieve a common external tariff among all countries
in Latin America, thus it should be able to rival other trade
blocks like the EU and the North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA).
But this grand-design, targeted to crystallise within the next 10
years, has to cross several bridges first. First it has to remove
the remaining internal tariff for certain products that are traded
between the Mercosur members itself.
	   Brazil, the dominant partner in Mercosur, has 27 products with
tariff protection, Argentina 220 products, Uruguay and Paraguay 900
products each. The tariff is to give some form of protection for
the manufacturers of these products.
	   `We hope to remove all tariff barriers between Mercosur members
by the year 2006. Then there will be an even more effective trade
flow between Mercosur members,' says Rosa. There is also a common
external tariff factor that has to be considered. Currently, the
common external tariff among the Mercosur four countries averages
12 per cent.
	   But this common external tariff has to be reduced further to
ensure uniformity with other countries in Latin America, thus
paving the way for the entry of more countries into Mercosur.
	   Chile, for instance, has plans to cut its external tariff from
11 per cent to eight per cent this year. But Brazil and Argentina
have plans to raise the external tariff of Mercosur countries from
the present average of 12 per cent to 15 per cent.
	   The proposed increase in external tariff means it will be a
longer wait for Chile to be a full-fledged member of Mercosur. The
addition of Chile into Mecosur means a lot as it will be a major
step forward in the Latin America trade block becoming a reality.
	   The move to raise external tariff is basically to add more
revenue to the coffers of both countries, especially Brazil which
is under severe pressure to reduce its public debt deficit and
devalue its currency, the real. A devaluation will mean a nightmare
for Argentina and the other two Mercosur members as these countries
will depend a lot on exports to Brazil. A devaluation of the real
will also further delay the removal of existing internal tariff
structures between Mercosur countries.
	   The formation of Mercosur also faces competition from the
all-powerful United States which has set its sights on forming a
Free-Trade Area of America (FTAA) by the year 2005. The FTAA will
encompass 34 countries from the whole continent and be even bigger
than the EU. US president Bill Clinton visited several Latin
American countries last year with the hope of securing allies for
the formation of FTAA, but his talks did not progress as expected.
	   Brazil and a few other South American countries prefer to fully
develop the Mercosur first, before even thinking of FTAA. 'We want
to see Mercosur progress. Only then will Brazil be able to focus
its attention on other trade blocks in the continent. Although
there are disputes on tariff structures, Mercosur is here to stay,'
exerts Rosa.
	   Although Brazil is resisting the formation of FTAA, it does want
to see a trade pact between all countries in the continent
eventually. This is necessary if it wants to explore new markets
for its massive economy.
	   While the development of Mercosur faces challenges at the top of
the administrative heirachy, on the ground, the trade integration
between Mercosur countries is moving well.
	   A new US$,36 million border crossing between Brazil and
Argentina was opened early this year to cut waiting time for
hauliers. Talks are also underway between Mercosur countries on
strategic government procurement of goods and services, which
amounts to about US$ 70 billion a year. The Mercosur countries have
also agreed on cross-border transfer of pension rights.
	   All the wealth in the exchange of trade between Mercosur
countries has a tremendous effect on the industries in Rio Grande
Do Sul. Out of the US$ 15.56 billion of trade flow between Brazil
and its Mercosur partners, US$ 4 billion was attributed to
industries in Rio Grande Do Sul.
	   Dr Luciano Andre, the executive secretary to the Federation of
Industries of Rio Grande Do Sul, says that more than 20,000 people
from all over Brazil use their facilities every week. Goods to be
exported to other Mercosur countries can only be done after
obtaining certificates from the Federation of Industries of Rio
Grande Do Sul. The federation issues a certificate after
ascertaining that the goods meet the local content requirement.
	   `Besides Mercosur, the state also thrives because of its
excellent infrastructure and its proximity to Sao Paulo,' says
Andre. Sao Paulo is regarded as the commercial capital of Brazil
but it is already congested.
	   `So many investors come here because the infrastructure
facilities. For instance the state has one of the best roads in the
country and it facilitates the movement of goods from one point to
another with minimum logistics trouble,' says Andre.
	   Rio Grande Do Sul's strategic position at the hub of Mercosur
and its infrastructure has enabled the state to attract
multinational companies, especially in the automobile sector, to
set up investments in the state.
	   Andre says among the companies due to start operations are
General Motors, Ford and Goodyear Tyres manufactures.
	   `The main objective of locating their operations in the state is
to tap the market of Mercosul countries. For instance more than 30
truck bodies are exported to Mercosul countries per day,' he says.

	   WE continue our discussion on a type of random access memory
chip, the dynamic RAM or DRAM chip. There are two types of DRAM -
the single inline memory modules RAM (SIMM RAM) and dual inline
memory modules RAM (DIMM RAM).
	   The SIMM RAM for personal computers (PCs) before the 486 have
30-pin connectors while newer PCs have 72-pin SIMM RAMs. However,
DIMM RAM comes with 168-pin connectors. Ever wonder why the SIMM
must be installed in pairs while the DIMM comes single? Well, the
answer is simple. For Pentium-based PCs, the motherboard supports
the central processing unit (CPU) at 64 bits.
	   A SIMM RAM transfers data at 32 bits. Therefore, to transfer
data at 64 bit to match the CPU's bus width, you need two SIMM
RAMs. So, each bank of RAM will consist of two slots for inserting
SIMM RAM.
	   What about DIMM RAM? Well, each DIMM RAM is able to transfer
64-bit data at one time. Therefore, its bank will consist of only a
single DIMM RAM.
	   From early last year, it gained wide usage. It is expected to be
used mainly in Pentium and Pentium II-based PCs.
	   The RAM chips come in either one of these two types: parity or
non-parity.
	   A parity RAM will check itself for errors using the ninth bit
built in the chips. The extra one bit will be used for this purpose
while the other eight bits will be used for operations. This ninth
bit will be able to prevent corrupted data from being written onto
secondary storage devices.
	   However, parity RAM chips are more expensive than non-parity
chips. Non- parity RAM chips do not have the extra one-bit chip
thus making it cheaper but without the checksum operations.
	   Most home PC motherboards are meant for non-parity chips.
	   Bear in mind that non-parity systems will support both parity
and non-parity RAM chips but not the opposite. Parity systems will
only support parity chips and not non-parity chips. RAM that is
able to fix error on data, such as error-correcting code (ECC) RAM
is used for the new 440 LX chipset in Pentium II machines.
	   The connector of a DRAM may be in chrome or gold. A gold-plated
RAM is more expensive than the tin-plated connectors as it lasts
longer and does not corrode easily. However, use RAMs that have the
same type of metal as its connectors compared to the slot on the
motherboard to avoid chemical corrosion between the two metals.
	   You must also be careful to select a RAM that suits the voltage
of your CPU as the voltage difference may burn the RAM chips on the
board.
	   Older CPUs use five volts while processors after the second
generation of Pentium (Pentium 75 above) use 3.3 volts as core
voltage. DIMM RAM uses only 3.3 volts. Refer to your PC's
documentation for more details.
	   To insert a RAM into its slot, you must follow these few steps.
First, remember to ground yourself as memory chips are prone to
electrostatic discharges. You can touch some metal objects to
de-charge yourself.
	   Insert the SIMM RAM into its slot at a 45-degree angle and make
sure that the notch near the centre of the slot fixes nicely with
the RAM, otherwise you may accidentally insert it in the opposite
direction. Make sure the connectors are firmly in the slot. Hold
the two ends of the RAM and lift it up.
	   The RAM will hold firmly upwards with one click from each side
of the tabs on the slot. That's it, you're ready to go. Switch on
the computer and observe the RAM test. If there's an error or
beeping, it means your RAM is not fixed properly in its slot or the
RAM is damaged. Consult someone with computer technical knowledge
if necessary to do it for you.
	   In contrast to a RAM, the read-only memory (ROM) offers
permanent data storage that is inalterable. ROM which has permanent
data that can be altered but is rarely done is known as
programmable read only memory or PROM. ROM that is often
reprogrammed is known as erasable read only memory or EPROM.
Simple, isn't it?

	   LATE LAST year, Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux showed off its largest
and latest high-tech water treatment plant in Vigneux-sur-Seine,
20km south of Paris.
	   At its inauguration, French Environment Minister Dominique
Voynet was impressed with the plant's ability to remove pollutants
in water although, she said, it would be better if industries did
not cause pollution in the first place.
	   But we don't live in an ideal world: the pollution problem is
unlikely to go away. And water suppliers need to continuously
search for better ways to purify the water. Lyonnaise, which
supplies drinking water to over 70 million people world-wide,
focuses its research and development activities on new methods to
purify drinking water and protect the environment, says Jack Moss,
its international marketing director, water division. Its
activities span the entire water cycle, from water resource
management to wastewater treatment through a worldwide network of
research and expertise centres.
	   Daniel Villessot, deputy director of its technical and research
division, says Lyonnaise spends over 300 million French francs a
year on research and development. The bulk of the funds goes to
Lyonnaise's International Water and Environmental Research Centre
(CIRSEE) in Le Pecq, France, where about 300 scientists and
technicians work on new processes to purify both raw and polluted
water.
	   CIRSEE designed the Cristal (Combination of Reactors
Incorporating Separation and Adsorption of Liquids) process for the
Vigneux-sur-Seine Membrane Ultrafiltration Plant which Lyonnaise
claims is able to provide the highest quality of water possible
now. The plant is the biggest in the world to use ultrafiltration
membranes to treat drinking water. The Cristal process, according
to Lyonnaise, improves the organoleptic quality of water and
anticipates new types of pollution such as pesticides. It, thus,
enables the plant to deal with accidental pollution which is
frequent in surface water. The ultrafiltration membrane technique
is said to eliminate unwanted flavours and tastes in water without
the use of chemicals but preserves its natural mineral content.
	   CIRSEE is also working on a wastewater reuse and recycling
programme, because of limited fresh water resources and increasing
demand for water.
	   Bruno Levine, water reuse research engineer at CIRSEE, says
recycled water can be used for non-potable purposes such as car
wash, fountains, cleaning streets and flushing toilets. Other
applications are in industries, for example in air-conditioners,
and agriculture and landscape irrigation.
	   Levine says recycled water can also be used to recharge ground
water sources which can be affected by prolonged urban use. The
recycling technology will lead to a 30 per cent reduction in water
use, he says.
	   Moss feels that ultimately, recycled water can be consumed by
humans.
	   But people are not psychologically prepared to consume recycled
water. It will take a long time to convince them, he says.
	   The Northumbrian Lyonnaise Technology and Research Centre in
Newcastle, England, works on improving existing water distribution
and wastewater collection systems.
	   In Asia, Lyonnaise has set up the Asia-Pacific Technology and
Research Network (Astran). Managed from Kuala Lumpur, the network
has research centres in Macau, Sydney, Manila and Jakarta.
Villessot says Astran will concentrate on water resources and
problems specific to Asia.
	   Lyonnaise's strong focus on RD, says Villessot, is to enable
the company to maintain a competitive edge in the world market by
providing added services at declining costs.
	   Recognising the new global challenges, Compagnie de Suez and
Lyonnaise des Eaux merged in April last year to form the Suez
Lyonnaise des Eaux group. The merger, says Moss, is a `marriage of
different capabilities.' Lyonnaise was in a capital-hungry cycle of
business as the payback time of its Asian projects was over 10
years, he says. In the meantime, Suez, which had lost its
industrial base but was cash rich and strong in electricity, was
looking to refocus its activities. By coming together, the two
companies could be in the forefront of private infrastructure
services. Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water division of the group, is
the world leader in the water sector, says Moss.
	   The Fanco-Belgian group is refocusing on its three core business
of energy, water and waste services and is planning to develop its
operations outside the two countries. Last year, the group derived
30 per cent of its total revenue of 112.1 billion French francs
from France, 44 per cent from Belgium and 26 per cent from the rest
of the world. Its revenue from the Asia-Pacific region was three
billion French francs.
	   The energy sector contributed 64 billion French francs to the
group's revenue in 1997, waste services 15 billion French francs
and communications 2.4 billion French francs.
	   Revenue from the water sector was 30 billion French francs in
1997, a seven per cent increase compared to 1996. This sector
reported a profit of 1.4 billion French francs last year, an 11 per
cent increase compared to 1996.
	   With demand stabilising in Europe, the group's spotlight is
shifting to the developing countries. It's positioning to seize the
opportunities arising from deregulation of public monopolies and
the growth of mega cities in these countries.
	   The Asia-Pacific region contributes five per cent to the total
revenue of the group. `It's a small amount but we plan to increase
this to 15 per cent in five years,' says the group's Asia-Pacific
president, Martin Negre. Lyonnaise plans to invest about US$1
billion in the next five years on several build-operate-transfer
projects in the region. It already holds several water and
wastewater concessions and projects in Macau, China, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand and
Cambodia.
	   Bruce W Bland, managing director of Lyonnaise (South East Asia)
Sdn Bhd, says the company is prepared to invest over RM10 billion
in Malaysia over the next two decades. It is eyeing several deals
in Putrajaya, Cyberjaya and states which have yet to privatise
their water supply.
	   Bland says Lyonnaise and its local partners have invested over
RM1 billion to supply bulk drinking water to 1.9 million people in
Perak, Johor and Sabah. In Perak, Lyonnaise holds a 34.4 per cent
stake in GSL Water Sdn Bhd, the concessionaire for supplying bulk
drinking water to Taiping, Kerian, Larut and Matang districts. Its
local partners are Gopeng Bhd (22.8 per cent), Wembley Industries
Holding Bhd (20 per cent) and Sisma Water Technology Sdn Bhd (22.8
per cent).
	   In Johor, Lyonnaise has a 25.5 per cent stake in Equiventures
Sdn Bhd which supplies drinking water to the Johor Baru district.
The local partners in the joint venture are Kembangan Dinamik Sdn
Bhd (49 per cent) and Pilecon Engineering Bhd (25.5 per cent).
Lyonnaise also owns Strategi Tegas Sdn Bhd, the operator of the
Sungai Layang Water Treatment Plant and Sungai Johor Water
Treatment Plant.
	   In Sabah, Jetama Sdn Bhd holds the concession to supply water to
the Kota Kinabalu area. It's a joint venture between Lyonnaise
which holds a 35 per cent stake, the Sabah government (20 per
cent), John Holland (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (10 per cent) and Hume
Industries Bhd (35 per cent).
	   Privatisation doesn't necessarily lead to an increase in water
prices, says Negre. In some countries with undeveloped
infrastructure, he points out, people spend an enormous amount of
time and energy to get their daily water supply. Often, he says,
there is profiteering and the poor end up paying 10 to 20 times
more to buy water. Lyonnaise, he says, is committed to supply water
in a cheaper way for all to share.
	   `There is no such thing as a free glass of water,' adds Bland.
There are hidden costs in the water supplied by government
agencies: the water is subsidised. By delegating the job to private
companies, he says, governments can divert the money to meet other
needs such as education, health and housing.
	   Bland says governments also lack funds to improve existing
networks. `By shifting the burden from the government to private
companies, better services will be provided.' The efficiency gains
will lead to a better water system at lower prices, he says. For
example, Bland points out, three years after Equiventures took over
operations, the quantity of water supplied in the Johor Baru
district increased three times. Lyonnaise and its local partners in
Equiventures invested RM800 million to have the automated, most
technologically advanced water treatment plants in Malaysia, he
says. Its computerised predictive and preventive maintenance
programme has considerably reduced the number of plant breakdowns
and cut total maintenance costs, he adds.
	   In Macau, Negre says Lyonnaise and its partner, the New World
Group, have successfully reduced non-revenue water from over 40 per
cent to about 12 per cent after changing 70 per cent of the piping
network. (Non-revenue water is water lost during the distribution
process due to technical and non-technical factors such as leakage
and theft). In Malaysia non-revenue water is between 40 and 45 per
cent.
	   Water is basic to life. Aware of the sensitivities involved in
the business, Lyonnaise is painstaking in its choice of partners.
`We go for genuine partnerships with the locals and have a
responsible attitude to profits,' says Bland. And Lyonnaise takes a
long-term view of investments, about 20 to 25 years, adds Moss. He
says the payback time of its projects is over 10 years. Lyonnaise
seeks to support the local community leadership, not usurp its
powers, says Moss. `We advise, you decide.' Bland says Lyonnaise
prefers the delegated management concept where the government
retains ownership of assets and sets the price, quality and
quantity of the drinking water. Private companies will only manage
the utilities. Bland says the concept is successful in Malaysia due
to the advantage each partner can bring to the business.

	   3Com Corp has announced the availability of its OfficeConnect
Remote Dual Analogue router which is designed to enable access to
information at the fastest speeds possible over analogue lines.
	   According to 3Com's product line manager for entry-level systems
PDD Andrew Moloney, the product is able to offer a near-integrated
services digital network (ISDN) speed of 112 kilobits per second,
which is equivalent to the power of two 56Kbps modems.
	   He claimed the router also offers functionality over standard
analogue lines but without the costs that are normally associated
with maintaining a digital service.
	   ``This product is ideal for small and mid-sized businesses
because these outfits might not have the technical expertise to
install complex products but need the advanced technology to keep
them competitive in the current market,'' he added.
	   Moloney said the new router is simple to install as users need
only to connect their existing unit to their computer and existing
phone lines.
	   ``Once done, the hypertext markup language (HTML) Web-based tool
takes the users through the configuration process. The system is
usually up and running in under 30 minutes.''
	   With the new router, small organisations now have a high
performance networking solution with competitive benefits that are
typically found in large companies, according to Moloney.
	   ``Organisations are now capable of implementing applications
like electronic-mail (e-mail) while extending the local area
network (LAN) to remote users,'' he said, adding that the router
utilises already existing analogue phone lines to offer the
benefits of high-speed information access.
	   Another member of the OfficeConnect family is the Dual Speed Hub
8 which provides eight twisted-pair connections. With a built-in
switch and Class II Fast Ethernet repeater, the product is designed
specifically to cascade to other hubs and permit connection of up
to four hubs in a series, Moloney said.
	   Meanwhile, the OfficeConnect Switch 400 provides the flexibility
in small-office switching. According to Moloney, users will be able
to migrate effortlessly between 10 megabits per second and 100Mbps
with the performance benefits of switching.
	   Certified for domestic environments, the switch is designed to
provide maximum throughput of 400Mbps and a direct connection to a
server or end station or even to another hub or switch, he added.
	   Now available in the market, the router is priced at US$745
(RM2,830).
	   The hub costs US$755 while the switch is priced at US$755.

Ugandan government criticized for neglecting its own in favor of Sudanese rebels

	   LIRA, Uganda (AP) _ Frightened nurses speak in low voices in the
hospital where two soldiers groan in pain from wounds received when
they stepped on a land mine.
	   Sgt. Reuben Tugineyo and Cpl. Edward Adima were among 18 sent to
protect the village of Oririm, 54 kilometers (30 miles) east of
Lira two weeks ago when Lord's Resistance Army rebels penetrated
deep into central Uganda.
	   ``We followed the rebels ... they took off, leaving behind a
land mine, which we stepped on,'' said Tuginyeo, 32.
	   At the time, the army boasted that it had the rebels surrounded
because they had ventured too far from their bases in southern
Sudan.
	   But by Friday, the rebels, operating in small units, had managed
to elude government troops, and people expressed fears that the
government of President Yoweri Museveni is on the losing end of the
11-year insurgency.
	   ``They (the government) have already lost the war. The
government is not effectively defending the people. They send a few
soldiers to fight off the rebels,'' said Opio Moro, a Lira civic
leader. ``For the war to end, there must be a mutual understanding
between Uganda and Sudan.''
	   People in Lira and Oririm believe rebel penetration south and
eastward from two northern districts has overstretched the army.
They also believe Uganda's support for rebels in southern Sudan
fighting the Islamic government in Khartoum has made it difficult
to end the war with the LRA rebels.
	   More than 10,000 people fleeing the rebel attacks have swarmed
into Lira, 370 kilometers (230 miles) north of the Ugandan capital,
Kampala. They are camped out in seven primary schools.
	   ``People are panicking as they are not sure what will happen
next. Soldiers are not permanent here. Only 18 were sent to defend
our village,'' said Silvester Otiti Akeny, a teacher whose sister
was killed in an attack during which he was briefly taken prisoner.
	   Lira administrative officer Jacob Ettedu says the rebel tactic
of avoiding major military and civilian centers to attack soft
targets like remote villages at night has paid off.
	   ``They move in very small groups. A whole government battalion
is attracted by these small numbers. If they moved in groups of,
say, 200, the army would finish them,'' he said.
	   Another local official charges that Museveni's only brother,
Gen. Salim Saleh, whom he named ``overseer'' of the Defense
Ministry, spends more time helping Sudanese rebels than engaging
the LRA.
	   ``I asked Salim Saleh to come to our area and defend us,'' said
Opio Moro. ``He told me he was going to Sudan. The army is engaged
in Sudan and fighting wars in other countries.''
	   Others believe that the northern insurgency has gone on for so
long because of the shift in Uganda's power base 12 years ago when
Museveni, a southerner, ousted a government made up largely of
northerners.
	   The argument is that northerners may not be ready to accept a
head of state from the south, and secretly sympathize with the LRA,
whose goals, other than ousting Museveni, are vague.
	   Around town, frustrated people blame the long war on the
government's refusal to negotiate a peace settlement with LRA
leader Joseph Kony.
	   ``The war will never end here,'' said school principal John
Etimu. ``Let the government talk with the rebels. Museveni's
government supports rebels against Sudan, and in the process,
neglects its people.''

	   DESPITE Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's reiteration
that layoffs should be kept to a minimum, `human bloodletting will
be unavoidable' as MB writers predict (A Merger Wager, April 16
issue). In the same issue, a team member of Andersen Consulting
cited casualty rates of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent in lost
jobs, arising from bank mergers abroad. Then, on April 15, 1998,
the president of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress reportedly
announced that the number of retrenched workers stood at around
35,000 so far. The number of jobless in the foreseeable future
seems to be headed upwards.
	   Amid this gloomy scenario, there have been concerns that some
still profitable companies may be taking advantage of the current
situation to retrench their staff. Others cite mergers or
acquisitions or plummeting demand as justifying the unkind cut.
Still, others such as financially strapped companies may feel they
have a watertight justification to cut their workforce.
	   But there is a need for some lateral thinking in this layoff
issue, specifically in tackling it. As people may be aware, the
jobless disease can exact a big toll, both at the macro and micro
levels. Rising unemployment can only mean reduced incomes, which in
turn will backfire on businesses which removed them in the first
place. But firms don't normally view things this way. They retrench
mainly because they are short-term and desperate. Sometimes, they
forget that they are in the business for the long haul. Retrenching
staff can adversely affect the morale and productivity of the
remaining staff, especially if their retrenched colleagues were to
be given a raw deal. Those who are fortunate to remain in the
payroll work under conditions of uncertainty until the economic
recovery is in sight.
	   Meanwhile, there are those who view the perceived excess staff
like a gangrenous leg - to be quickly cut off, lest it endangers
the bottomline of the companies. The business reengineering experts
often think in terms of efficiency in justifying their
recommendations to companies to remove staff from the payroll. The
have no qualms as to what their recommendations could do to human
lives who need food, drink, clothing and shelter as much as them.
They will not understand the human trauma of being out of a job
unless they experienced retrenchment themselves.
	   The consultants and their converts often and primarily think in
terms of ever-increasing improvements in corporate performance,
recommending that companies should be lean and mean in a fiercely
competitive world. This, they argue, is the stuff that business is
made of, if they want to thrive in a dog-eat-dog world.
Unfortunately, social considerations such as job security or job
stability, a clean and healthy working environment, etc, are
nowhere to be found among the higher rungs of their ladder of
priorities. Perhaps, there is a need to rethink the whole business
of being in business. Are we in business just for the sake of
profits per se?
	   Are we to think layoff at the first signs of trouble or weak
demand.
	   Let us not be quick to ape the American way of hiring when it's
fine and firing when in decline. We need to fashion our own
indigenous model -in good times, do not profligate but save wisely
for the rainy days. That way, we will have the option of retaining
jobs, instead of ruthlessly throwing people out of their jobs. We
will then prove to be business owners or managers with a heart and
a healthy social conscience, and our staff will surely love and
remember us for it.
	   This is the kind of loyalty and trust that staff are expecting
their employers to display when the going gets tough, ie, employers
remaining loyal to their staff at the time when their staff need
them the most in keeping their jobs and earning a decent
livelihood. Not only will staff love and remember them, they will
also want to be loyal and give their best to their caring employers
who stood by them.
	   Still, the critical questions remain: how can jobs be saved in
an economic and financial crisis? Can they be saved?
	   If people are willing to put on their thinking caps, it is not
difficult to arrive at a solution. Yes, we can save jobs - many
jobs in fact, for the good of our country, families and
individuals. There is no necessity to walk the path of least
resistance and let go of our staff (those leaving voluntarily are
exempted) so easily, unless of course there is a hidden agenda.
Here, the various media can help by spreading the word that it is
possible to save jobs, for example, by highlighting creative ways
and means of preventing job destruction. One of the ways is for
both the companies and unions to arrive at some amicable agreements
to save jobs.
	   Together, they can prevent the already flagging economy from
becoming worse than it needs to be. Together, they have the
capacity to restore job stability and job security before the job
situation gets worse.
	   For one thing, unions can initiate job-saving measures by laying
meaningful concessions at the negotiating table with the employers.
	   Concessions such as pay and benefit cuts can help to retain some
staff under the payroll. The non-unionised employees can also
follow the unions' example and accept lower remuneration and
benefits to save jobs. Each senior staff or manager's pay cut has
the potential of saving anything between two to four lower-paying
jobs. Just think of the possibility of enlisting the support of
more senior people in affected companies throughout the country to
willingly accept pay and benefits cuts! Apart from wage cuts,
companies should also do their part and explore innovative ways and
means of reducing non-wage costs. In this regards, the involvement
of staff in preventing their companies from declining or collapsing
is crucial. The impact on our nation would be both positive and
great if all parties concerned were to do just that. This, in turn,
will help ease the needless trauma and anxiety arising from the
possibility of losing one's job.
	   Interestingly, there is a biblical example of how caring and
concerned people helped those in need in a marvelous way. They
truly sacrificed by selling their possessions and goods and
distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. This story is
recorded for us in the book known as Acts.
	   Likewise, those who own or run businesses can make some
sacrifices by, for example, selling some of the companies' assets
to help avoid slashing jobs at the first sign of trouble. In bad
times such as this, they could also consider trimming unnecessary
non-wage costs, postponing non-critical capital expenditures,
reducing wastage, implementing wage and benefit cuts and the like
to prevent their profitability indicators from worsening, as well
as to preserve the livelihood of their staff.
	   For employees who see their pay cheques shrink, they should see
their sacrifice as a way of helping their colleagues from being
thrown out of jobs, which may otherwise cause much hardship to the
unemployed and their dependents. For the more senior employees who
suffer bigger paycuts in absolute terms, they need not fret but
realise that they are contributing something worthwhile and
meaningful in life. After all, how much does a senior staff need to
live on?
	   In a nutshell, all the above is part and parcel of what we, as a
nation, should be striving to build - a society with a heart.
Together, let us seize this opportunity to establish such a caring
society.

Fontanelli wins 16th stage, Zuelle keeps overall lead

<TEXT>
	   ASIAGO, Italy (AP) _ After a long breakaway from the main pack,
Fabiano Fontanelli edged Paolo Bettini and Mario Scirea at the
finish of the Tour of Italy's 16th stage Monday.
	   That trio of Italians finished seven seconds ahead of a group of
chasing riders and nearly 12 minutes ahead of the top contenders.
But Fontanelli was in 77th place before the stage and not a threat
to the favorites for the overall title.
	   Alex Zuelle, who opened up a substantial overall lead with a
dominating time-trial performance Sunday, retained the pink jersey
heading into the toughest climbing stages.
	   Fontanelli was timed in 5 hours, 53 minutes, 53 seconds over the
227 kilometers (140.5 miles) from Udine to Asiago, into the
Dolomite mountains.
	   Zuelle was 29th on the day, 11:46 behind. Pavel Tonkov, the 1996
Giro d'Italia champion, finished 30th and remained second overall,
2:02 off the pace.
	   ``I always believed I could do it today,'' Fontanelli said after
his fourth career Giro stage triumph. ``I knew if I gave it a shot
I could pull through with a win. There's no surprise. I've won
stages before.''
	   Bettini had been the protagonist most of the day, breaking out
in front along with Javier Ochoa of the Kelme team. Bettini
repeatedly urged Ochoa to help do the work of providing a leading
draft, but the Spaniard refused and Bettini eventually took off
alone.
	   He was joined at the front by Scirea and Fontanelli with about
10 kilometers (6 miles) remaining.
	   ``I'm a little bitter. I don't know what the Kelme team was
thinking,'' Bettini said. ``Fabiano I know very well. We were
teammates last year so I know he's fast and could beat me.''
	   Tuesday's 17th stage takes the riders 217 kilometers (134.5
miles) from Asiago to Selva Val Gardena, including four tough
mountain passes in the last 100 kilometers (60 miles).

	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Cheered on at home by a stadium
filled with frenzied fans, the Netherlands' men's team defeated
Spain 3-2 in sudden-death overtime Monday to win its third field
hockey World Cup.
	   Olympic champion Netherlands, twice winner of the World Cup in
1975 at Amsterdam and 1990 at Lahore, lifted the title following
Teun de Nooijer's golden goal in the 13th minute of extra time.
	   Spain took the lead in the 18th minute through a field goal by
Javier Arnau.
	   A penalty corner conversion by Victor Pujol increased Spain's
lead before skipper Stephan Veen pulled one back for Netherlands in
the 58th minute.
	   Penalty corner specialist Bram Lomans scooped the ball into the
cage in the 61st minute to give the Dutch the equalizer and take
the game into extra time.
	   De Nooijer slammed a penalty corner rebound after goalkeeper
Ramon Jufresa had blocked the shot from Lomans with two minutes of
extra time remaining.

	   FANCY A dapper look, oozing with English charm and elegance?
	   Then check out the Alfred Dunhill Spring/Summer 1998 collection,
which draws on English style to fit the corporate businessman. The
theme for this season's collection rests on slim and sleek
tailoring with comfort as an underlying factor, while ties take on
an English country garden theme.
	   `English style is currently in vogue,' says Peter Tilley, Alfred
Dunhill's international design and merchandise manager. `It's
sartorial, reflecting the art of the tailor and the traditional
English tailoring skills of London's Saville Row.' For those who
are young at heart, the slim tailoring of Dunhill's designs
emphasise cut and fit, belying a simple and understated elegance.
	   Corresponding to today's expectations, clothes are comfortable;
suits focus on lighter tones of grey and blue, and colours such as
tan, naturals and pastels are used to soften jackets. Ties are
filled with images of flowers, fruits and garden tools, swimming in
vivid shades of orange, yellow, lime and deep red.
	   The emphasis is on simple styling with soft, functional and
lightweight material such as blends of wools and cotton to render
the garments comfortable. The adventurous should find plenty of
room to experiment with the many colours and prints that this
collection offers. Tilley feels that the smartest and most
conventional chap in the corporate workplace would just as easily
and happily slip into something casual and dressed down on weekends
and evenings.
	   Dunhill's hacking jackets have a slim silhouette and come in
varying shades and patterns. A majority of the jackets come in
graphic checks in spicy mustards and browns or muted greens and
greys to classic navy blues. Try throwing together a sophisticated
look with a dark blue checked jacket with a bright blue shirt and
grey pants. A shimmering grey tie tops off the look. The art of
looking sophisticated with the many colours and designs to choose
from lies in keeping the look balanced.
	   Casual wear takes on both the sporty and the sophisticated
touch.
	   Weekend wear is a burst of colours ranging from bright hues of
crimson to subdued shades of pastel blue. Try co-ordinating a
powder blue blouson with navy blue corduroys and a blue and green
checked cotton seersucker shirt. Sports jackets are also in again
with a wider range of colours and patterns.
	   Avid golfers will find that Dunhill has their love of the sport
in mind in its golf wear collection. Golf shirts have wider
armholes and are tailored slightly longer in the back to facilitate
movement. Pants are made from Tencel and cotton, allowing for
easier surface cleaning.
	   For those who are still a mite baffled by two and three button
jackets, here's a reminder: a three-button jacket tends to favour
the slim, if your build is slightly on the tubbier side, go with
the two-button jacket. The same rule of thumb applies to blazers;
the six-button double-breasted blazer fits better on lean frames
while the four- and two-button blazers are more suitable for
tubbier frames. Also, if you prefer to follow the proper English
way, only the middle button is done up in a three-button jacket.

	   THE RECARO name is renowned worldwide as a German product, and
holds the position of undisputed leader in car seats the world
over. The name draws covetous envy and inspires awe among the
majority of motorists. Among drivers of luxury sedans, high-end
sports coupes and `souped-up' racing or rally cars, Recaro is the
seat of choice. Indeed, Recaro has become a cult brand in car seats
worldwide, not only because of its snob value and aesthetic appeal,
but also because of its ergonomic qualities. In the words of Recaro
managing director Klaus Fricke, seats bearing the Recaro name are
`more than just a technical extra'. He says Recaro seats offer
added value, emphasising a certain zest which reflects a degree of
hedonism for drivers with discerning tastes.
	   Quietly - and with little fanfare - Recaro has come to Malaysia,
and in the process, has made this country its regional base. For
nearly a year now, Recaro seats have been made in Malaysia, and
within the next few months, will be produced with 50 per cent local
content. After overcoming initial teething technical problems, up
to 80 per cent of Recaro seats made at its plant in Shah Alam now
find their way back to Germany for the export market. This is on
top of the 8,400 seats produced in 1997 which was delivered to
Proton for the Putra.
	   A little history. Recaro comes from the combination of the first
two letters in Reutter and Carosserien. Two Reutter brothers,
Wilhelm and Albert, had in 1906 set up the Wilhelm Reutter car and
bicycle factory in Stuttgart, Germany. They gained a reputation for
engineering excellence, producing non-production line vehicles in
the Germany of the 1920s. After the Second World War, Reutter the
company produced car bodies for Opel, BMW and Porsche, among
others. When Porsche took over its operations fully in 1963,
Reutter became Reutter Carosserien - shortened to become Recaro
-producing seats for Porsche. In 1969, the brothers sold Recaro to
a group made up of suppliers and competing firms, including seat
manufacturer Keiper of Remscheid. The production base was also
moved from Stuttgart to Kircheim. In Germany, the parent company is
called the Keiper Recaro Group which has a total of nine factories
all over the country.
	   Recaro now supplies to 35 automobile manufacturers in 45
countries, and its seats are found in 50 different car brands
worldwide. Its upmarket cachet is ensured by the fact that Recaro
is the exclusive supplier of seats to Porshce.
	   Speaking during the opening of the latest Recaro showroom in
Shah Alam recently, Fricke said Recaro's international sales are
expected to total around RM760 million this year. This is a 40 per
cent increase from the RM540 million recorded last year. `Our goal
is to increase production from the current 343,000 seats to 800,000
seats per year within the next five years. I truly believe Malaysia
is part of this exciting strategy. Our growth here is based on
mutual benefit,' he says.
	   Recaro established a presence in Malaysia back in July 1997 with
the setting up of Recaro South East Asia Sdn Bhd. It was set up
with a local partner, Car Seat Malaysia Sdn Bhd which is in the
process of acquiring an equity stake in the joint-venture. Malaysia
has been chosen as its regional headquarters with the setting up of
two production lines for the Recaro SR and N-Joy seats in Shah Alam
at a cost of RM1 million. These production lines now employ 50
employees.
	   Today, Recaro's investment in Malaysia has exceeded RM4 million,
and this is expected to increase by another RM2 million with the
planned production of a range of child seats. Last year, the Shah
Alam plant produced 12,000 car seats valued at RM11.2 million for
the local and export markets. Its local production is mainly geared
to supplying seats for the Proton Putra and Proton Wira 1.8 rally
car. Exports of Malaysian- made Recaro seats, meanwhile, go to
Europe, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.
	   Recaro South East Asia managing director Jurgen Fritz says an
increasing percentage of local components go into the manufacture
of Recaro seats.
	   `We consider Malaysia a good source of materials. We have chosen
Malaysia as our regional headquarters because it offers our company
positive prospects in terms of rich resources and world-class
facilities.
	   Furthermore, the government's open and liberal policies make
Malaysia a viable and profitable location for foreign investors
like Recaro,' he says.
	   Looking after sales in the region is Malaysian Lau Man Chong, a
25-year veteran of the automotive industry who serves as Recaro
South East Asia's regional sales manager. Lau says in the region,
Recaro seats are exported to Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Hong Kong. `The majority of our seats end
up in the ``after-market'' segment where drivers take out their
existing seats and replace them with Recaro seats,' he says.
	   The current economic climate has not dampened Fritz's outlook on
Recaro's prospects in Malaysia. He believes there are many
challenges and opportunities still available in the region. `We
have been in the business of making seats for over 90 years and
during this time, there have been equally testing periods. We can
weather this storm,' he says.
	   Fritz says the current economic situation allows Recaro to be
more competitive, thus enabling its export products to be more
keenly priced.
	   With increased local components, Recaro hopes to develop better
pricing structures for both the local and export markets. `This
strategy should increase demand, output and ultimately profit,' he
says.
	   He adds, `It is important to emphasise that Recaro established
its operations in Malaysia as it sees the long-term growth for the
Malaysian economy as excellent. While our exports to neighbouring
countries are experiencing some current difficulties, these markets
will recover, and Recaro will be in a good position to successfully
exploit opportunities in these economies as they revive and
rebuild,' he says.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda, freed
from house arrest when coup-related charges against him were
dropped Monday, immediately went to his opposition party
headquarters to plan his next move.
	   Kaunda, 74, walked out of the High Court in Lusaka after
Attorney General Bonaventure Mutale said the state wouldn't
prosecute Kaunda on charges he concealed prior knowledge of an Oct.
28, 1997, coup attempt.
	   ``I feel great,'' said the nation's founding father, wearing a
thick white beard he has grown since his arrest on Christmas day.
Supporters waved two-finger victory salutes and cheered.
	   Aides denied reports that Kaunda's retirement from politics was
a condition of his release.
	   ``There were no conditions. The state didn't have a case they
could win,'' said Sakwiba Sikota, a lawyer for Kaunda.
	   Kaunda drove through downtown Lusaka, waving his trademark white
handkerchief, and met with supporters and colleagues at the
headquarters of his United National Independence Party, the main
opposition group.
	   Kaunda said he was aware of pressure on him to hand over control
of his party to younger leaders.
	   ``I am going to listen to the people who have been discussing
this, then I'll decide,'' Kaunda said.
	   Party officials said Kaunda told them he wanted to convene a
party convention to decide what to do next.
	   The South African government welcomed Kaunda's release, saying
in a statement that it ``creates an opportunity for all political
parties to engage in a meaningful dialogue.''
	   Kaunda led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964 and was
president for 27 years until he was ousted by Frederick Chiluba in
the first democratic elections in 1991.
	   Last year's coup attempt against President Chiluba by junior
military officers was quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   Many foreign countries had pressed Zambia to release Kaunda or
give him a speedy trial.
	   Also freed was Moyce Kaulungombe, Kaunda's bodyguard, who had
faced the same charge as his boss.
	   One state witnesses was to have testified that Kaunda predicted
an ``explosion'' in Zambia days before the failed coup, said Wezi
Kaunda, the politician's second son.
	   Kaunda had spoken ``in the metaphorical, social sense. That was
the best evidence they had,'' Wezi Kaunda said.
	   Mwangala Zaloumis, an official of Kaunda's party, said Kaunda's
arrest has increased his popularity.
	   In January, Kaunda was transferred from a maximum security
prison to house arrest.
	   His release on Monday came on the first day of the trials of 81
suspects _ most of them soldiers _ who were arrested on suspicion
of involvement in the coup attempt.
	   Kaunda repeatedly declared his innocence. The charge against him
carried a possible penalty of life imprisonment.
	   Most of the other suspects are charged with treason and face the
death sentence.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The central computer on board Mir was working
again Monday night, after a three-day breakdown that threatened to
postpone the Russian space station's last rendezvous with a U.S.
shuttle.
	   The Mir crew now hopes to reactivate the station's automatic
steering system, said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian
Mission Control. The shuttle can only dock with Mir when the
steering system keeps it properly aligned.
	   The space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday and
dock with the station Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew Thomas,
the seventh and last American to live on the Russian outpost.
	   Lyndin said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   Ground controllers fully loaded the software into the computer
Monday night, and the crew was able to get it working again within
about 90 minutes. Reactivating the steering system can take an
entire day.
	   During a chat with ground controllers during the repair process,
Musabayev said the situation on board ``isn't bad'' but added that
he was concerned that it occurred on the eve of the shuttle's
launch. ``I'm worried not for myself, but for the flight program,''
he said.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a shuttle ferry flight
in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months of
trouble-free operation. The station's crew has replaced it with a
back-up computer brought up by a Russian cargo ship.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply is
threatened because it can't keep its solar panels in optimum
alignment with the sun.
	   Depending on how much energy was lost, it can take from one to
three days to get the orientation system fully on-line.
	   Fortunately, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was
on the so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight
round the clock. As a result, the Mir's solar panels have remained
in full sunlight.
	   The crew also shut down some systems to save energy, and as a
result Mir's batteries were full on Monday, making it easier for
the crew to restore the orientation system, Lyndin said.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Some hobbled on makeshift crutches,
a few carried stretchers and others broke into a run as helicopters
carrying emergency aid landed Monday in remote northern
Afghanistan, devastated by an earthquake that killed more than
3,000 people.
	   On a small distant hillock, a woman cuddled her infant, a
toddler sat nearby wailing. Crouched behind, her head buried in a
bright orange shawl, a woman sobbed.
	   The quake, which hit Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of
6.9, flattened entire villages, sliced mountains and triggered
landslides. The estimates of the dead vary from 3,000 to 5,000
people. Thousands more are homeless and missing.
	   The force of the quake literally sent houses roaring down
mountainsides into the valleys below. There are estimates of up to
80 villages heavily damaged, and another dozen completely
obliterated.
	   Aftershocks lingered in the region Monday, sending frightened
residents scrambling outdoors. Many people are refusing to return
to homes still standing, said Sarah Russell, a United Nations
spokesman in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``The aftershocks that continue to shudder through the region,
sometimes only minutes apart, keep people from moving back into
their houses and remind a population already traumatized . . . that
another could easily strike,'' she said.
	   In Chaujan, a village near the quake's epicenter, thousands of
homes were flattened. People wandered through the rubble, dazed. In
the middle of the devastation, a lone wooden door stood erect. The
clumps of mud still clinging to it was the only reminder of the
home that once stood there. The family of four that once lived
there were dead.
	   The International Red Cross and the United Nations scrambled to
establish mobile medical units in Shari Basurkh, about 50
kilometers (30 miles), from Faisabad, the capital of northern
Badakhshan province.
	   Doctors Without Borders were operating a clinic there.
Helicopters ferried the wounded, many with broken bones. Aid
workers also distributed blankets, tents and plastic sheetings.
	   Among the hardest hit areas was Rostaq, the site of a Feb. 4
earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left another
8,000 homeless. When Saturday's quake hit, many in the area were
still living in tents because they had lost their homes in the
February quake.
	   Aid workers at the site said people were traumatized, their eyes
unfocused, their hands searching through the rubble. Many of the
wounded loaded onto helicopters were old women and men and small
children.
	   Cargo aircraft from neighboring Pakistan, packed with emergency
supplies, reached the region Monday.
	   As relief workers reach the hardest hit areas, they have begun
worrying about the risk of diseases like malaria, because of the
rain, Russell said. Other health hazards include hemmhoragic fever
and cholera, she said.
	   The French Foreign Ministry also planned to send about 35 tons
of humanitarian aid to nearby Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where it will
be transported to the disaster area.
	   Anti-Taliban soldiers who control this region say they have
removed 1,650 bodies, but they said thousands more people are dead.
	   The alliance spokesman Shamshul Haq Arianfar said eight villages
simply disintegrated.
	   Many of the homes in the area, already weakened by the February
temblor, crumbled like dry dust in Saturday's violent shaking. The
homes were made more vulnerable by the relentless rain that
battered the region in recent days.

Annan encouraged by response from prime ministers of India, Pakistan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Following nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan, Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke by telephone with the
prime ministers of the two countries over the weekend and was
encouraged by their response, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
	   Spokesman Fred Eckhard gave few details of Annan's conversations
with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif except to say they were to ``encourage
dialogue on peace and security issues including Kashmir.''
	   ``He was encouraged by their reactions and intends to continue
to engage with them on these issues,'' Eckhard said. ``He was just
encouraged by their openness with him and on that basis he is
prepared to stay in touch with them.''
	   The United News of India reported that Vajpayee rejected any
third party mediation between India and Pakistan to help resolve
the Kashmir issue.
	   Annan has offered to help the parties resume their high-level
dialogue, which broke down last year over Kashmir, the Himalayan
territory which is divided between them. India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over Kashmir.
	   The Security Council has issued statements deploring the South
Asian nuclear tests and has called on both India and Pakistan to
sign nuclear control treaties without conditions.
	   India and Pakistan have resisted such treaties because they do
not require the five permanent Security Council members _ the
United States, Britain, France, Russia and China _ to dismantle
their own nuclear arsenals.
	   Foreign ministers of the five permanent members are to meet this
week in Geneva to consider the next steps in trying to curb the
nuclear arms race on the subcontinent.

	   LET ME confess: I am a failed business journalist as evidenced
from the months of story-lessness, the unofficial media jargon for
non-productivity. I stand now as a sucker for tales of those who
can spin a report ala Fortune from stuff that baffle me: financial
records, boardroom politics and shareholding value. That's why I
ploughed through Bloomberg by Bloomberg, the czar of the financial
information industry, with deep reverence.
	   Michael Bloomberg needs no introduction. The founder of
Bloomberg L P took an extraordinary 12 years to build a media
empire that encompasses online and wire services, radio, television
and the print media.
	   He is hailed as Wall Street's best known generic name; utter
Bloomberg and all these will come to mind - Bloomberg Financial
Markets, a top provider of online financial information; Bloomberg
News, a wire service providing news stories to leading newspapers
worldwide; Bloomberg News Radio, a 24-hour nationally distributed
news radio; Bloomberg Business News, a public television programme
for the investment community and Bloomberg Television, a 24-hour
direct satellite television network.
	   But alas, I discovered that he had never been a journalist, so
no tips to gather, no uplifting morale to pick up and no insight
into the operations of a Bloomberg editorial room. This is no Ben
Bradlee's (former managing editor of Washington Post) riveting
insight into the workings of Washington Post. But plodding on
grudgingly, I was rewarded with a powerful personality -
hard-hitting candour with arrogance and humility surfacing at
times, a patronising attitude at other times, but an unmistakable
force of energy.
	   Nothing in his early life indicates that he would one day be
playing David to the Goliaths of the media industry. Armed with an
engineering degree from John Hopkins University and a masters
degree in business administration from Harvard University, he took
up a friend's suggestion to apply for a job at Wall Street's
Solomon Brothers  Hutzler (now called Goldman, Sachs  Co) as an
equity trader. For someone who had queried 'Who are they? What
would I be doing?', he loved the job, `reveled in it every minute
of the day', and quickly rose up the ladder to become a Wall Street
star and partner of the prestigious firm. As he said, he loved Wall
Street not just for the money but the lifestyle it provided. He had
humble beginnings. His father was a dairy accountant, and his
mother, a home-maker. High-style Manhattan living enthralled him.
He remembered gawking at a French restaurant's opulent decor,
having a meal with more silverware per place setting than his
family owned in total, cruising uptown in a black limo when the
only other time he had been in such a car was at his father's
funeral, and gasping at a US$ 50 tip someone had given for a two-
dollar cab ride - an amount that would have covered his entire
week's personal, social and food budget. He fittingly called this
chapter of his early life, Capitalism, Here I Come.
	   But the good life came to an end when he was 39. The firm's
merger with Phibro Corporation resulted in the termination of
several partners, including Bloomberg. After 15 years of 12-hour
days and six-day weeks, he was told: `Here's US$ 10 million; time
for you to leave.' His initial reaction: `US$ 10 million? America's
a wonderful country.' Then, with the outgoing partners, he shot
pool, smoked Cuban cigars, played poker and laughed uproariously.
As he says, `I never look over my shoulder. Once finished: gone.
Life continues.' All the same, he was worried his wife would be
ashamed of his less visible status and he broke the news with a
style that very few can afford: he presented her a sable jacket and
champagne. His contention: a sable jacket seemed to say, 'No sweat.
We can still eat. We're still players.' Yeah, I couldn't agree
more. The end of the good life spells the beginning of an even
better life! Any gutsy entrepreneur with money can enter the news
business anytime.
	   But starting something from scratch is far from easy. Bloomberg
succeeded because he filled up a gap in the financial information
industry (in his words, `making news with numbers' - combining text
and analytics with computer-driven tours that let readers
automatically see the calculations and graphs of what was written,
and followed up with words to expand what the illustration showed)
and built up his organisation's strength from there. As he says,
`From the beginning, we tried to be different.' Much to his credit,
he instinctively knew `unless our news was impartial, free of any
outside influence, and not tied to some hidden agenda, then no
amount of money or talent would assure us success as journalists'.
He admits that one must learn what one doesn't know, and then, get
access to the people who do know. He relies on professional
journalists for Bloomberg's editorial policy and the management of
the newspeople. His natural flair for the media industry and
unshaken respect for editorial ethics explains why the Bloomberg
News rivals Dow Jones and Reuters quickly.
	   More than a piece of interesting reading, the book is certainly
engaging and packed with information on how to start a lean, hungry
company and keep it that way. The book is instructive of how he
builds up his media empire, plays catch-up with the Goliaths of the
industry, balances the dollar sign with the honour of the written
word and his management style.
	   But it's not purely a business perspective, he seems nostalgic
in recalling his childhood days and family. And for those who yearn
for words of wisdom from the czar, there's also terrific, albeit,
patronising advice on how to increase and guard your investments.
The one I love - and keep reminding my hubby and thus relieving us
of the guilt of not being able to leave dollops of cash for our
offspring - `children have no God-given right to an inheritance ...
(what matters is) the best education and a grubstake to start them
off.' Take it from Bloomberg - the emperor of the financial
information industry knows what he is talking about.

	   WITH so many unit trust funds set up in the last few years, the
country's first Bumiputera unit trust funds must surely be feeling
the heat from new competitors.
	   Amanah Saham Mara Bhd (ASMB) has not been taking it lying down.
It plans to open up funds which have been exclusively Bumiputera
for the last 30 years to all Malaysians. Says group managing
director cum chief executive officer of ASMB, Datuk Kamaruddin
Mohammed, `We have plans to re-launch the existing Tabung Kumpulan
Modal Bumiputera (TKMB) funds and open them to all Malaysians.'
Certainly this change is a milestone. `Yes, times are different
now,' concurs Kamaruddin. If implemented, it would mean that
non-Bumis will have more choices when it comes to ASMB's funds.
Currently, only five funds out of 15 are open to non-Bumiputeras.
They are ASM FPF, ASM Premier, ASPT (only for Tenaga Nasional Bhd
staff), Dana Al-Aiman and ASM TP Balanced Fund. All TKMB funds are
open to Bumiputera investors only.
	   Kamaruddin started off in ASMB as a marketing executive in 1969,
and is recognised today as one of the longest-serving chief
executive officers in the unit trust industry in Malaysia. He has
held a Securities Institute of Australia fellowship and gained work
experience Down Under.
	   Malaysian Business caught up with him to find out about what's
in store for the funds, the unit trust industry, the economy and
more. Excepts: How about a backgrounder on ASMB, the first
Bumiputera unit trust fund in Malaysia?
	   We were established in 1967. Our first Bumiputera unit trust
scheme was set up the next year, even before Perbadanan Nasional
Berhad (PNB) and Amanah Saham Nasional (ASN). Our first fund, the
Tabung Kumpulan Modal Bumiputera 1 (TKMB1), now renamed Dana
Al-Aiman, was first launched in 1968 and relaunched last year.
Between 1968 and 1980, we launched 12 funds. But most of these -
they were mainly TKMB funds - were very small, with an authorised
size of 20 million units per fund only. They were small because the
economy during that era was not as robust as the previous decade's.
The initial investment required was only RM20-RM50. But over the
years, the value per unit has grown tremendously - from RM1 to
RM12.
	   During that time, we gave out a lot of bonus issues and
dividends. The original investors then cashed out and moved into
other funds. Therefore, the 12 funds shrunk in terms of unit
circulation. Now, they are worth about RM1-RM2 per unit.
	   (ASMB was incorporated in 1967 and is wholly owned by Majlis
Amanah Rakyat or MARA. ASMB, in turn, wholly owns ASM MARA Unit
Trust Management Bhd, which was set up in 1993 to take over the
management of trusts funds from ASMB. The 15 funds have a total
approved size of 1.2 billion units.
	   As of March 31, 1998, the number of units in circulation is
606.8 million).
	   How have your funds performed as compared to three months and
nine months ago?
	   Compared to nine months ago, when the Kuala Lumpur Composite
Index (KLCE) stood at 1,077.30 points (around June 30, 1997), our
funds have dropped by 33 per cent - the stockmarket fell by 42 per
cent during this time. However, since the stockmarket rebounded to
around the 700-point range at the end of March 1998 from a low of
about 470 points in January 1998, our funds have made a gain of 48
per cent over that three-month period.
	   What is your investment strategy in view of the current
slowdown?
	   Our strategy is to liquidate positions in the stockmarket and
invest more in money market instruments.
	   What sectors do you favour?
	   We favour sectors that are expected to be the engine of growth
for the future, for example IPPs (independent power producers). We
also like defensive stocks like food-based and consumer products,
and plantations.
	   We avoid construction, property, motor, banking and finance.
However, as long-term investors, we will not avoid all other
stocks. We have to keep our ears open, look at the balance sheet
and study the company. Some companies are not up there but could
perform. We like some Tier-1 banks and finance companies which are
priced very attractively now.
	   Who are your fund managers and what is their experience? Do you
engage foreign expertise?
	   ASM MARA has been managing the 15 funds since 1993. There are 10
fund managers in the team, including a general manager and myself.
We do not have any foreign fund managers working for us. We have an
investment panel and a syariah advisory panel comprising experts
with vast experience in the field. Aminah Jaafar, general manager
of ASM MARA, is a graduate of the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries  Administrators (UK) and has been with ASMB since
1970. Our five top management staff have clocked up more than 125
years in total service to the company.
	   After almost 30 years in the unit trust industry, what is your
opinion of the current state of affairs in Malaysia?
	   The net asset value (NAV) of the local unit trust industry,
including PNB, makes up only 8.9 per cent of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange's (KLSE) market capitalisation. Excluding PNB, the NAV is
around 1.7 per cent. Compare this to other countries - Thailand (16
per cent), India (25 per cent), Singapore (39.8 per cent),
Australia and the United States (40 per cent), and Japan (48 per
cent). This shows that there is tremendous potential for growth for
the unit trust industry in this country.
	   The sudden increase in unit trust management companies in the
market within a short time in the past few years should bode well
for the industry as it will help make the stockmarket more matured
and less speculative. However, the concept of unit trust investment
is still not very well known to the man in the street.
	   How do you think we could further develop the industry?
	   There should be stricter compliance rules to safeguard
unit-holders. To increase professionalism, fund managers should be
adequately trained to have a more global view. Ideally, they should
be able to analyse stocks worldwide for investment opportunities
rather than concentrate on local stocks only. The Federation of
Malaysian Unit Trust Managers (FMUTM) could provide the necessary
leadership and also oversee training programmes, say, for agents.
Agents have to be trained to be more professional so that they deal
with investors more as consultants rather than as salespersons.
	   Fund managers should also be allowed to invest in more financial
instruments, for example, the futures market. The regulatory body
should also come up with guidelines to allow sales through the
Internet.
	   Is there a shortage of fund managers and if yes, how do we
overcome the problem?
	   Yes, there is. To overcome it, we need more foreign fund
managers to train local fund managers via courses. It will also be
helpful if undergraduates were exposed to the principles and
practice of investment, especially in unit trusts. Universities
should also hold courses relevant to fund managers.
	   Why do you think investment in unit trusts has not caught on yet
with the public?
	   The Malaysian public is more used to the traditional modes of
savings, for example fixed deposits and bonds. Many of them are not
aware of the benefits/returns of investment in unit trusts as there
has not been much publicity on unit trusts until recently. Also,
there is an impression that Malaysian investors are more interested
in short-term gains and fast returns.
	   What is your advice for investors?
	   Individual investors need to map out their monthly expenses and
invest only the balance. They should diversify their investment
portfolio. Those who have already invested should keep their
investments and buy more to average out the cost. Now is the time
to invest to get better capital appreciation in the middle to long
term.
	   Time has proven that if you keep your money in unit trusts, you
will reap very good benefits. For example, if in 1968 you had
RM20,000 in unit trusts, it would have grown to close to RM1
million 25 years later. If an investment gives you a return of at
least 10-15 per cent per annum, it's a good investment.
	   Are you invested overseas?
	   No, at the moment. But we plan to in the future.
	   What is your outlook for the stockmarket and the ringgit?
	   For the short-term, the KLCI should range between 680 and 750
points. I expect the CI to hit 800 points at the end of the year.
This is because there is a lot of uncertainty in the market.
Developments in Indonesia would also impact on our economy. Ours is
basically a crisis of confidence. Sentiments of investors are
reflected in stock prices. The government has been trying its best
to show that our fundamentals are still intact but it is up to the
people to believe it or not.

	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Cheered on at home by a stadium
filled with frenzied fans, the Netherlands defeated Spain 3-2 in
sudden-death overtime Monday to win its third men's field hockey
World Cup.
	   Olympic champion Netherlands, twice winner of the World Cup in
1975 at Amsterdam and 1990 at Lahore, lifted the title following
Teun de Nooijer's golden goal in the 13th minute of overtime.
	   Spain took the lead in the 18th minute through a field goal by
Javier Arnau.
	   A penalty corner conversion by Victor Pujol increased Spain's
lead before skipper Stephan Veen pulled one back for the
Netherlands in the 58th minute.
	   Penalty corner specialist Bram Lomans scooped the ball into the
cage in the 61st minute to give the Dutch the equalizer and take
the game into extra time.
	   De Nooijer slammed a penalty corner rebound after goalkeeper
Ramon Jufresa had blocked the shot from Lomans with two minutes of
extra time remaining.

	   THE Rover Group, Britain's leading carmaker and exporter
announced an operating profit in 1997. It made an operational
contribution of STG31 million to its parent, BMW, compared to a
loss of STG29 million in 1996.
	   The group's four brands - Rover, Land Rover, Mini and MG
generated great interest at the recent Geneva Motor Show. This year
marks the 50th anniversary of Land Rover, the world's most famous
line of four-wheel drive vehicles. Taking pride of place at the
display was the Freelander, the new and highly-acclaimed sports
utility vehicle which is currently being launched across Europe.
Available in three body styles - Softback three-door, Hardback
three-door and five-door Station Wagon - the Freelander offers the
choice of 1.8 litre K Series petrol or 2.0 litre L Series diesel
power.

	   A MID the gloom of being retrenched, there is a ray of sunshine
for retrenched workers in the manufacturing and services industry.
	   The announcement by Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek
that the government will fully sponsor professional and technical
courses for retrenched workers is heartening. The move is also
timely as it will ensure that the retrenched workers would be able
to acquire new skills.
	   There is no doubt that the Malaysian economy will undergo
structural changes as it recovers from the stock market and
currency turmoil. The question is, will we be ready to take on
these new challenges as the economy picks up?
	   There will obviously be many new areas of growth. Just as the
mid-eighties recession brought about a shift in emphasis to certain
sectors and industries, the current downturn will give rise to new
areas of growth and opportunities.
	   Perhaps with the emphasis on information technology and the
multimedia super corridor, this area could be a new engine of
growth. In fact, IT- related courses are among the various diploma
and certificate level courses on offer.
	   The basic conditions for workers to qualify for any of the 133
diploma and certificate level courses is also flexible. Even
retrenched workers from companies not registered with the Human
Resources Development Council can apply.
	   The Malaysian workforce has in the past been very receptive to
learning new skills. It is hoped that those laid-off and still
unable to find a job will pursue these courses.
	   Even if they manage to find a job while attending the course,
they can always continue with it on a part-time basis. This is
certainly an opportunity not to be missed.

Metal Reclamation to go on expansion trail, BUSINESS TIMES

<TEXT>
	   AT A time when most businesses are consolidating, Metal
Reclamation Bhd is set to undertake a RM63 million expansion drive,
a big portion of which will be financed with internally-generated
funds and RM25 million with proceeds from its flotation exercise.
	   The flotation exercise involves a public issue of 5.97 million
ordinary shares of RM1 each at RM1.80 a share which will generate
about RM30 million for the company.
	   In an interview with Business Times, Metal Reclamation's
managing director, Mr Lim Sheng Seaw, said apart from the funds
generated in the flotation, the group will take up RM20 million in
bank borrowings to finance its expansion plan.
	   With this, he added, the group's bank borrowings will increase
to RM80 million which although looks big actually comprises largely
short-term loans for trade financing.
	   Lim pointed out that the group's borrowings for working capital
stand at only RM3 million compared with total credit facilities of
RM102 million granted by its bankers.
	   Thus, in actual fact, Metal Reclamation's debt ratio ``is very
small'' and it is in the long-term interest of the group to
partially finance its plans with proceeds from corporate exercises
because for the group to grow it is not advisable to be tied down
by huge long-term loans, he added.
	   It is for this reason, Lim said, that the company is going for a
listing as it will enable to have access to cash it needs to grow
within the reclamation and sale of lead and lead alloys industry
and to venture into other businesses that have synergies with the
group's forte.
	   ``The money that we raise from the listing exercise is for the
business which in turn will provide us with more opportunities
later,'' he added.
	   Lim said he is confident Metal Reclamation will receive
favourable response from investors when it is listed sometime in
the first half of this year since its heavy investments show the
company's strong commitment to its business.
	   Furthermore, he pointed out, the investing public should take
heart from Metal Reclamation's dominant position in the making of
lead acid batteries for motor vehicles.
	   There are four million scrap batteries in Malaysia every year
and Metal Reclamation controls close to 90 per cent of this
industry through its recycling operations.
	   Commenting on the weak sales of new cars, Lim said Metal
Reclamation will not be affected much as based on its projection at
least 150,000 new cars will be on the road this year to join the
existing four million cars already in use, providing the company
with a ready and lucrative market.
	   Even in the worst of times, he added, the company can look
forward to get the lion's share of the minimum two million
batteries a year used because car batteries last only two years.
	   In any case, Lim contended, Metal Reclamation's earnings base is
quite diversified with its batteries division contributing 30 per
cent to group turnover followed by 20 per cent from its cable
division which provides cable alloys used in the production of
paper insulated and lead covered cables, with the rest coming from
its pure lead and tin solders division.
	   For the year ended December 31 1997, the group recorded a
pre-tax profit of RM6.95 million on the back of RM203.88 million in
turnover which Lim said is expected to grow at a rate of 5 per cent
a year for the coming five years.
	   However, central to Metal Reclamation's plans to strengthen its
earnings base and its growth projection is whether it will be able
to build its proposed plant at Pulau Indah in Klang.
	   With the plant in operation, Lim said, Metal Reclamation will be
able to further diversify its business base by moving into, for
example, plastic recycling.
	   The plant, which is expected to cost RM63 million, will not only
increase Metal Reclamation's production capacity to 70,000 tonnes a
year from the current 36,000 tonnes of pure lead and lead alloys,
but will also be important in reducing usage of imported raw
materials to 30 per cent from 60 per cent.
	   It will also provide an opportunity to the group to once again
participate in the international market as it did in the early
1990s when a quarter of the group's turnover was derived from the
export market, Lim said.
	   He added that the company will not have any trouble getting into
the export market since its 99.97 per cent refined lead under the
brand name ``MRISB-MALAYSIA'' is registered with the London Metal
Exchange which enables the company to sell its products anywhere in
the world with trading conducted in US dollars.
	   Lim said this puts Metal Reclamation in an advantageous position
as the weakened ringgit has not impaired its profits since trade,
even in the country, is based on the US dollar and is only
converted to the ringgit at the point of sale.

Spice Girls, Gazza sensations have Britain in a tizzy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was all over the tabloids Monday, and the
quality papers, too. Questions were asked in the House of Commons:
Geri Spice is out. So's Gazza.
	   Two idols fallen on a single weekend, touching on national
obsessions with pop music, soccer and celebrity.
	   Geri Halliwell, 25, was the eldest member of the Spice Girls,
the inventor of ``girl power,'' the gorgeous pouting idol of
millions of pre-adolescent girls. She quit after a series of fights
with the other four members of the group _ and after earning a
reported dlrs 20 million in the two years since ``Wannabe'' put
them on top of the charts.
	   ``What a shame,'' the Daily Star said in an editorial. ``The
very power, energy and drive that made them a world pop phenomenon
has now destroyed them.''
	   Paul Gascoigne, 31, was a sometimes brilliant soccer player who
won the nation's heart with his tears when he was ejected from the
1990 World Cup. But the nation often had to think again: Gazza
drunk, Gazza posing at a urinal on his wedding day, Gazza's wife
Sheryl _ inevitably dubbed ``Shezza'' by the tabloids _ walking out
of the marriage with a bruised face.
	   ``His graceless existence has overwhelmed his footballing
qualities,'' said an editorial in The Mirror, the
second-largest-selling tabloid.
	   England manager Glen Hoddle dropped Gascoigne from the World Cup
squad because of his poor physicial condition. ``It's a great pity
that Paul has not got himself fit. It's a pity he has so many
injuries over the last months and the injuries kept coming,''
Hoddle said.
	   Halliwell's announcement of her retirement and Gascoigne's
dismissal were front-page naturals for the popular press. They even
rated brief mentions on the front of the Financial Times.
	   In the House of Commons, Labor lawmaker Gareth Thomas urged the
government to encourage Geri ``to think again.''
	   ``Are you aware that local authority initiatives to encourage
tourism in my area may well be undermined by the need to divert
resources to fund trauma counseling for the younger members of my
constituency?'' he said.
	   But Tom Clarke, the minister for film and tourism, said the
government wasn't inclined to intervene.
	   Gazza isn't the government's problem either, but Conservative
lawmaker Anne McIntosh managed to work his sad situation into a
discussion of the ``social exclusion'' of Britain's down and out.
	   ``I wonder if you would like to comment on the impact on the
England football team of excluding Gazza from the squad?'' she
said, drawing laughter from her colleagues.
	   Sports Minister Tony Banks said he hoped Hoddle had made the
right decision.
	   ``I expect the English team to do even better now, even with the
personal tragedy surrounding the football exclusion of that great
character Gazza,'' Banks said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian helicopter crashed in the Antarctic,
killing five people and seriously injuring four, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   The MI-8 helicopter with nine people on board crashed 15 minutes
after taking off from the Russian research vessel Academician
Fyodorov and shortly before reaching its destination, the Russian
Antarctic station Novolazarevskaya.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the four injured people were

	   IN condemning the nuclear tests by Pakistan, which was
responding to the tests conducted earlier by India, the world seems
to have forgotten that the nuclear arms race actually began many
years ago.
	   If India, a poverty-stricken developing country, is rightly
proud of its scientific and technical achievement in exploding five
nuclear devices, then Pakistan should also be proud of its
brilliant scientists and engineers in building and successfully
exploding not just five, but an incredible six nuclear bombs in a
matter of days.
	   A nation can be economically poor but this does not necessarily
mean that it is poor in scientific and technical talent.
	   The myth created by those in developed countries that an
economically poor nation remains poor because of the lack of
scientific and engineering talent has been exploded with the
explosion of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan.
	   In fact, the myth was first exploded in 1964 when China, another
big but poor country, exploded its first atomic bomb in 1964.
	   From that time onwards, poor and developing countries have begun
to realise that economic poverty did not necessarily mean poverty
in scientific and engineering talent. A nation may be poor but it
can also achieve certain things which the rich and developed
countries are able to do.
	   If anything else, the nuclear tests by Pakistan constitute the
latest demonstration of how a poor and developing nation can take
pride in its scientific and technical capabilities.
	   It is blatant hypocrisy that the current five major nuclear
powers, which have among them massive stockpiles of nuclear bombs
and missile warheads which can obliterate the world several times
over, can turn around and condemn India and Pakistan for going
nuclear.
	   If they do not want the other non-nuclear countries to go
nuclear, they should have set an example a long time ago and
completely destroyed their own nuclear stockpiles so that we can
all live in a nuclear-free world.
	   Instead, what really happened was that the Big Five nuclear
powers engaged in an expensive nuclear arms race which threatened
the world and introduced more destructive and dangerous weapons
over the years.
	   Technological one-upmanship was of such a magnitude that
billions of dollars were spent and precious scientific and
engineering resources wasted just to get a minor strategic edge
over the adversary.
	   There was even a chilling strategic concept known as MAD, which
stood for Mutually Assured Destruction. The frightening thing was
that MAD was not thought up by mad men but by seemingly respectable
persons with good brains and intellect and who had received the
right kind of education to qualify themselves to lead and manage
advanced industrialised countries.
	   To the advocates of MAD, tossing around with figures of millions
of dead and injured people as a result of nuclear attacks became
just a game.
	   Killing in a potential nuclear war was of such a scale that it
degenerated into a kind of intellectual exercise in the minds of
the nuclear strategists.
	   If a few hundred or even a few thousands are killed in an
ordinary conflict, one can feel the pain and the tragedy of those
who die, but in the more tragic circumstances of a nuclear
conflict, the millions of those who are wiped out are nothing more
than statistics because they are so many of them for us to feel the
pain.
	   The major nuclear powers have for years been arming themselves
with huge stockpiles of bombs and nuclear warheads which reflected
nothing more than the murderous desire for ``overkill.''
	   Why build a few thousand nuclear bombs when a few hundreds will
be sufficient to destroy your adversary?
	   There is no rationale for this desire for overkill and yet the
major nuclear powers, with all their highly educated strategic
planners, could not resist the temptation to build more and more
nuclear weapons over the years that the nuclear arms build-up took
on a life - and a momentum - of their own until the so-called Cold
War came to an end with the break-up of the Soviet Union.
	   However, even with the Cold War being over, the stockpiles of
nuclear weapons still in the hands of the five major nuclear powers
are enormous enough to destroy the world several times over. It
looks like the major nuclear powers are still reluctant to abandon
the ``overkill'' mentality.
	   The tests by India and now Pakistan may have introduced a
dangerous nuclear arms race in the sub-continent but the world
itself is neither a more dangerous nor safer place now than it was
before the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   The culprits who started the dangerous nuclear arms race - the
US, Russia, Britain, France and China - have not got rid of their
own nuclear arsenals. Therefore, they have no moral right to stop
other countries from conducting nuclear tests nor to build their
own nuclear weapons.
	   How can the existing nuclear powers condemn India and Pakistan
for conducting nuclear tests and building their own nuclear weapons
and missiles when they themselves have been doing the same thing
for years and on a much bigger scale?
	   The major nuclear powers have subjected the world - their own
populations and the peoples of other countries as well - for the
last five decades to the threat of a nuclear world war.
	   This threat still exists because they have refused to discard
their nuclear arsenals and yet they demand that other non-nuclear
countries should not go nuclear.
	   If the world is to be truly safe from the potential threat of
nuclear destruction, then the first step should be taken by the
existing nuclear powers themselves in completely destroying their
own nuclear stockpiles.
	   The only way to achieve a nuclear-free world is for the five
major nuclear powers to first free themselves from nuclear arms.

	   PSA Corp Ltd, DSO National Laboratories and CET Technologies Pte
Ltd signed an agreement on May 30 this year to jointly develop a
navigation system to operate automated guided vehicles (AGVs) at
PSA's container terminals.
	   This navigation system is the ``auto-pilot'' which controls the
movements of AGVs in the container yard.
	   Proven technologies for unmanned operations such as ground
vehicle control, navigation sensors, signal processing and wireless
communications will be used in its development.
	   This project is another commitment by PSA to invest in
capabilities to improve the reliability and speed of their
operations to serve their customers better.
	   It represents another phase in the automation of PSA's container
terminals, following the successful completion of the pilot testing
of AGVs last year.
	   In the next few years, PSA will implement this navigation system
to operate a small fleet of AGVs at one berth at its new Pasir
Panjang Terminal before implementing it at other berths.
	   DSO National Laboratories will design and develop the navigation
system and handle the design integration of the entire AGV system
based on the PSA's specifications and requirements. CET
Technologies will supply and integrate the components used in the
system.
	   PSA will provide the terminal operations knowledge for the
project and develop the deployment system for the AGVs.
	   In a statement released in Kuala Lumpur last Saturday, PSA group
president Khoo Teng Chye said: ``We are very pleased with our
partnership with DSO National Laboratories and CET Technologies.
	   This joint venture, he said, is an example of PSA's commitment
to invest substantially in technologies to develop pioneering
techniques in container handling that will significantly boost
productivity and service levels for our customers.
	   On safety record for 1997, PSA has reduced its injury rate by 45
per cent despite a 9.2 per cent increase in the number of
containers handled in the same year.
	   In 1997 there were 66 accidents causing injury to PSA staff and
non-PSA staff working at PSA's premises compared with 121 in 1996.
	   PSA's accident frequency rate (accidents per million man-hours
worked) was 2.5, lower than the rate of 2.6 for all industries in
Singapore.
	   In addition, PSA's accident rate per million TEUs handled was
reduced by 50 per cent from 9.4 in 1996 to 4.7 in 1997.

	   MORE AND more chief financial officers (CFOs) are embracing the
concept of total cost of ownership (TCO) for managing corporate
asset costs, with determining the cost of information technology
(IT) to your company being one of the most aggressive focuses.
While you may not be responsible for calculating IT TCO for your
entire organisation, chances are that someday soon someone will tap
your budgets under a heading that reflects IT TCO.
	   To get ready to manage relevant IT costs, a good starting point
would be to develop a working knowledge of TCO for desktop and
portable computers, and how to begin reducing PC-related costs
immediately.
	   It may surprise you to find out exactly how much PCs cost your
organisation. I know when I was first introduced to the figures for
my organisation, I was amazed, appalled and immediately suspicious
of the source of these seemingly inflated figures. However, after
seeing the strong relevance of these figures to the process of
calculating PC TCO, I was able to accurately verify these costs on
my own. Then, I was able to take action on reducing these costs for
my regional headquarters operation here in Kuala Lumpur, and other
Gateway operations in South Asia. More importantly, I've championed
efforts toward staff training to help Gateway better assist
customers in identifying TCO factors and issues to reduce customer
costs. Here's how you can get started.
	   Defining PC TCO In essence, PC TCO is all costs associated with
the acquisition and operation of personal computers; from the
initial purchase to training and support, including the cost of
downtime to your organisation. A more complete list of PC TCO
components looks like this: hardware - desktop and portable PCs and
peripherals, software -productivity software, utilities and
custom-developed applications, training - PC operation and
software-specific instruction, management -utility costs of PCs at
work, such as upgrades and enhancements, support - fixing hardware
and software problems, and downtime - lost revenue and productivity
due to system delays and failures.
	   When looking into these elements as cost centres, managers can
identify shortcomings, inefficiencies and waste associated with
PCs, whether it is for a small workgroup, department or an entire
organisation. Sometimes, these costs and potential savings can be
difficult to identify at first, yet, they can ultimately be very
dramatic.
	   Hardware myths: Cheaper is not always better To begin with, one
common misconception that I had, and many managers have, is that
hardware is the principal cost associated with PC TCO. In fact, it
is one of the smaller elemental costs, typically representing less
than 20 per cent of PC TCO.
	   Here's an example. Under hardware, one can take the original
price of a PC, then add the cost of additional peripherals, ie,
modems, printers, scanners, etc. Also included in the hardware cost
is any fee associated with delivery, set-up, and configuration for
the system and all peripherals. This is quite straight forward.
	   However, what is not so clear is the connection between a
specific hardware purchase - regardless of initial price - and the
impact on other elemental costs such as management, support and
downtime. This is where the serious TCO action often takes place.
	   Management makes it happen Management describes the cost of
leveraging PCs in the work environment.
	   This encompasses general systems administration, such as
alterations to hardware or software capabilities to suit changing
requirements. This does not, however, include repairs, which fall
under support. In some environments, management may also reflect
the cost of network management and administration, but frankly, for
workgroups and departmental managers, PC TCO is best calculated
separately.
	   The golden rule for reducing management costs for PCs is to buy
systems that support current and foreseeable future requirements.
Why? Today's cheaper PCs may be capable of handling your current
requirements, but one modest software update can easily make that
investment obsolete, requiring new systems. The result: no cost
savings on management, with often a negative and lingering impact
on support and downtime as you and your team come face to face with
the ramifications of a short-sighted purchase.
	   In today's market, here's how to avoid early PC obsolescence.
Think in terms of purchasing fresh technology. Generally, it comes
down to performance, capacity and manageability. Today's
performance desktop PCs are based on Intel's Pentium II-class
processors, where for obsolescence avoidance, I recommend systems
running at 300 MHz or more with 64 MBs of RAM and 4 GBs of hard
disk, such as Gateway's E-Series E-3110 300. The E-3110 comes with
advanced manageability features built in, giving PC users and
systems administrators the ability to diagnose and anticipate
problems before they occur, which can save downtime and money.
	   Similarly, for portable systems look at Pentium II processors
with enough RAM and hard disk space to grow on.
	   Support for office PCs Support includes all costs associated
with fixing hardware and software problems. The good news is that
PC hardware and software has become far more reliable since the
dawn of the PC revolution. The bad news is that this enhanced
reliability is most often only achieved by investing in
high-quality, brand name systems to avoid faulty components and
software compatibility issues.
	   Here again, the golden rule for reducing support costs is to
invest in quality systems from a vendor who you are confident will
be around tomorrow. Vendors must be directly accountable to both
requisitioning managers and users in providing solid warranties,
and then stand behind their products with extended support
programs. Support is a major cost centre because having a trained
professional capable of fixing most PC problems arrive at your
location costs money. But, as where there is smoke, there is fire,
when there is support, there is downtime, and that can be most
costly of all.
	   Downtime equals lost revenue and productivity Downtime cost
calculations can be somewhat tricky, but as you will see, it is one
of the most significant issues regarding PC TCO. To make this
calculation, you must first factor how much time management and
staff spend interacting with the computer to conduct their jobs.
Next, you figure the cost to your business when computers don't
work, in the form of lost revenue or sales and lost productivity.
	   It takes little imagination to consider a variety of
circumstances where PC TCO of a given computer can multiply in
hours or even minutes. Savvy managers quickly begin equating down
computers as a steady stream of revenue seeping through cracks in
the floor. You are very lucky if you are having trouble imagining
such dire circumstances. But these circumstances do not have to be
so dramatic. Intermittent failures or even slow performing systems
sap productivity, often both materially and spiritually on the part
of employees.
	   My best advice on reducing downtime is two-fold. First, invest
in quality, both in terms of hardware and software. Second, take
advantage of vendor-provided internal or external support
professionals and insist on fast, effective problem resolution.
	   Software on the rise in TCO Software continues to grow as part
of PC TCO, and in many cases, eclipses hardware and other cost
elements. This is especially true in environments with a
significant investment in customised applications software, such as
resource planning, accounting and GroupWare.
	   Reducing software TCO is best accomplished by rigorous software
asset management and training. Studies have shown that an
organisation's software costs can often be reduced by between 20
and 30 per cent or more through a more complete accounting and
administration of software licenses. For example, computers most
often come equipped with operating systems, but are regularly
reigned into corporate software licensing agreements.
	   Even more common are situations where purchased software goes
uninstalled or forgotten, delivering no value to the organisation.
	   Training is paramount The most important aspect of ensuring
returns on software investments and other elements of PC TCO is
training. Of course, some managers and staff insist that software
training is unnecessary or a poor use of time.
	   Here again, experience shows that time spent on training can
significantly boost productivity on both standard and custom
software applications.
	   You have most likely heard someone look over your shoulder and
say, `Wow, I didn't know that button could do that!,' or `That
feature certainly would have been great to know about when...'
Beyond productivity, software specific training also helps identify
what not to do, and contributes to avoiding downtime.
	   Standardisation leads to cost savings The fastest route to
reducing PC TCO is through standardisation.
	   Standardisation among hardware and software vendors and
configurations leads to savings and significant efficiencies in all
elements of PC TCO, especially in areas such as support, training
and downtime.
	   Identifying the appropriate model of desktop and portable
computers that will satisfy current and future requirements is the
first step. My company, Gateway, has implemented a global offering
called Custom Integration Service (CIS) that focuses on helping
companies identify specific requirements for desktop and portable
computers and reducing PC TCO. CIS goes steps further by building
each system's hardware and software configuration exactly to an
individual customer's specifications, then delivering the system to
the customer's door. Customers simply remove the box and plug in
the new system to start productive work.
	   PC TCO checklist Here's a checklist to help you begin to
identify and reduce PC TCO: quality products serving current and
future requirements, quality support to avoid problems and
downtime, quality training pays off in productivity enhancements,
asset management reduces redundancies, and standardisation improves
all aspects of PC TCO.
	   I look forward to answering any questions you have regarding
managing PC TCO or other topics that I've covered in this column.
Next time, I will be focusing on ways to manage repetitive stress
problems associated with computer use.

	   PARIS (AP) _ In normal times, an Air France strike would merely
cause havoc.
	   But the walkout by the carrier's pilots Monday was worse: a deep
embarrassment for a country preparing to host in just nine days the
world's biggest sporting event, the World Cup.
	   Despite pressure from leftist government ministers, most of the
state-run carrier's 3,200 pilots stayed out of their cockpits to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
They are threatening to stay out for two weeks or more.
	   That's well into the World Cup, which begins June 10 and lasts a
month. On just the first day Monday, 100,000 passengers were sent
scrambling.
	   And it could be only the beginning: French train workers were
planning to strike at the end of the week.
	   Desperate travelers lined ticket counters at Paris airports
Monday, while the Air France planes they were supposed to take,
many colorfully painted with soccer players for the championship,
sat idle.
	   Departure screens offered a bleak sight: they alternately
flashed ``annule'' and ``canceled'' in bright red.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, hoping to leave on vacation for Senegal, said
it wasn't fair that the pilots were striking just before the World
Cup, which is being played in 10 cities across France.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone. It's too
bad,'' he said at Charles de Gaulle Airport.
	   The airports in Lyon and Marseille, France's second and
third-largest cities, were virtually deserted. Rental car agencies
did brisk business.
	   Hassan Beloumi spent only a few minutes at the Marseille
airport. The 63-year-old Tunisian was supposed to fly back to
Tunis, but couldn't get any information. So he decided to stay in
France.
	   ``I'll go back to Tunis when the strike is over,'' he said. In
any case, he added, ``I'll have a longer vacation.''
	   Mark Wall, an American living in Amsterdam, had to return from
Lyon quickly for professional reasons.
	   ``No problem,'' he said at the Lyon-Satolas airport. ``They gave
me a ticket for tonight on a Sabena flight.''
	   At Paris' other main airport, Orly, Air France had arranged for
Vince Narez and his wife to take a Northwest Airlines flight back
to California.
	   ``We're not very happy about it, but we want to get home,'' said
Narez, of San Jose.
	   Passengers ``are being taken hostage,'' the French passenger
association ADUA said angrily. It called the walkout by the pilots,
among the highest-paid in the world, ``a strike by the privileged
of the skies.''
	   It said the strike was hurting France's image and offending
taxpayers who paid billions of francs (dollars) to bail out the
once-struggling airline. It called for anti-strike demonstrations
in the airports.
	   The walkout would be Air France's longest in 27 years if it
lasts the projected two weeks. It was an embarrassing blow to the
leftist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   The Communist transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, on Sunday
made a final appeal for both sides to negotiate. But by late
Monday, no new talks were planned.
	   ``Negotiating teams are ready at Air France,'' said the
carrier's director general, Henri Gourgeon.
	   The airline said it would make good on its commitment to fly
World Cup teams.
	   But it canceled 90 percent of long-haul flights Monday, and most
short- and medium-haul flights.
	   Unlike past conflicts, when ground crews blocked runways and
clashed with police, the pilots simply didn't show up for work.
	   They are protesting plans to save dlrs 83 million through salary
cuts while offering pilots shares in the airline. They also are
angry about salary cuts for starting pilots.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main union, the SNPL,
admitted the strike's consequences were ``disastrous.''
	   ``But when you're confronted by an attack you have no choice but
to defend yourself,'' he told France 2 television.
	   The union has called a 15-day renewable strike. Three smaller
unions have called for a strike until Thursday.
	   Also for Thursday, the CGT union is calling a strike affecting
most public services, and the energy and construction sectors.
	   In Paris, Michael Apstein of Boston didn't mind taking a later
connecting flight to Montpellier on another airline, Air Liberte.
	   ``It's nice to have a strike once in a while,'' he said, ``so
you can go into Paris for lunch for four or five hours.''

	   IF BINARIANG Bhd, the young but aggressive telecommunications
conglomerate, can sell a huge chunk of its shares to yet another
foreign partner, there is no longer any justification to prevent
other Malaysian companies from following in its footsteps.
	   This is especially so when the foreign interest Binariang is
selling its stake to is a company controlled by the Singapore
Government.
	   Some Malaysian parties - public and private - seem to have an
aversion for all things Singaporean even though they are good.
	   Binariang, a company seen by many as enjoying a special position
in the country's corporate arena, has by its sale of shares to
Singapore Telecoms, provided others with an equally strong
justification to sell theirs to foreign parties in their desperate
efforts to stay alive.
	   Binariang, which counts among its prized possessions Maxis
cellular and fixed line telephone services and Astro satellite pay
television, is understood to have wooed the Singapore company to be
its second foreign partner.
	   Its first foreign partner is US West International, which holds
19.8 per cent of Binariang's shares.
	   While Binariang, whose literal Malay translation means ``happy
building'', declined to comment on the deal, it is understood that
Singapore Telecoms may buy as much as 40 per cent of the company's
existing paid-up capital.
	   If the figure is correct, foreign shareholdings in Binariang
will be only slightly lower than the 61 per cent maximum allowed.
The Government recently raised the maximum for foreign equity in a
telecommunications firm from 49 per cent to 61.
	   The Singapore Telecoms deal is said to be worth RM1.4 billion.
	   Several local companies have either sold substantial stakes to
foreign firms, or announced plans to sell strategic blocks of their
shares to foreign partners.
	   With many local companies facing debt and cash flow problems as
a result of the ringgit's depreciation and the sharp fall in the
prices of shares, the alternative to insolvency is to sell shares
and assets.
	   The disposal of shares and assets to foreigners is fast becoming
an imperative for local businessmen as credit dries up and interest
rates remain prohibitive.
	   Sales to local investors do not seem possible as they too face a
credit squeeze. The use of many capital market instruments to
finance share purchases is either officially curtailed or is
commercially not feasible due to the shortage of funds and the high
interest rates.
	   As it now stands, only foreign investors are capable of buying
shares and assets of local companies, and are willing to pay a much
higher price than what is currently quoted on the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange.
	   With the exception of problems brought about by the sudden and
sharp depreciation of the ringgit and the ensuing credit squeeze,
many Malaysian companies remain viable.
	   This is recognised by foreign long-term investors who are keen
to take up strategic shareholdings as well as use Malaysian
companies as vehicles for regional and international expansion.
	   Unless the Government has a better and surer way of solving the
problems of these companies, it should not discourage them from
selling their shares and assets.
	   It can help speed up approvals and encourage local companies to
seek out strategic foreign partners instead of having these firms
selling their shares and assets outright.
	   Before the crisis, companies could wait for months for their
applications to be approved without major problems to operations.
Today, they need approvals more speedily as weeks or even days make
a big difference.
	   It is better to allow local businessmen, including Bumiputeras,
to divest part of their holdings instead of forcing them to retain
their shares and risk bankruptcy.

Israeli army jeep hits suspected Palestinian infiltrators 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli army jeep collided Monday with a car
carrying six Palestinians who sneaked into Israel from the Gaza
Strip, the army said.
	   The Palestinians tried to escape in a waiting car with an
Israeli license plate, the army said.
	   When an Israeli army jeep tried to block the car, the two
vehicles collided, the army said. Two soldiers and two of the
Palestinians were slightly injured. The other four were arrested.
	   In a separate incident, the Israeli army set up checkpoints
Monday around the Palestinian village of El Khader in the West Bank
after shots were fired toward two Israeli vehicles on a highway
that passes the village.

	   MALAYSIAN Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) sees the sale of a 15 per
cent stake in Malakoff Bhd to UK-based National Power Plc (NPP) as
necessary to maintain the group's overall financial strength.
	   Chief operating officer Izzaddin Idris said on Saturday that
MRCB is going through with the agreement as it is a ``good value
deal'' which will see the group selling part of its stake at a
premium price.
	   The sale, together with the proposed disposal of MRCB's 51 per
cent equity interest in Teknik Janakuasa Sdn Bhd, will result in
MRCB deriving an extraordinary gain of RM480 million which will be
used to pay off a substantial portion of its borrowings, which will
be reduced to RM1.2 billion from the current RM1.6 billion.
	   A huge portion of the borrowings arises from MRCB's US$250
million (US$1    RM3.89) bridging facility to finance the
subscription of 34.7
million new shares and 14.9 million warrants in Rashid Hussain Bhd.	   Thus, Izzaddin said, the deal will effectively help reduce the
group's debt ratio to 0.4 from the current 0.6 against
shareholders' funds of RM2.86 billion.
	   It is also expected to offset the translation loss of RM372.5
million (based on the assumption that the exchange rate is RM4 to
US$1), as MRCB will have an extraordinary gain of RM480 million
based on both the corporate exercises.
	   However, he said, the sale should not be seen just as a dollar
and cents deal, as MRCB stands to gain an important strategic
partner which will open many doors to Malakoff in the international
power market.
	   NPP is a renowned international player with operations in Europe
and India, and it has invited Malakoff to participate in some of
their overseas projects, Izzaddin said. ``But due to the current
economic environment, we would rather concentrate on the domestic
market first,'' he added.
	   Furthermore, MRCB sees NPP as a useful strategic partner in
Malakoff's domestic market, especially where direct foreign
investment is required.
	   Izzaddin said this when asked to comment on the rationale for
MRCB's disposal of a 15 per cent stake in Malakoff, which has been
described as a ``cash cow''. Malakoff chalked up a quadruple
increase in pre-tax profit for the half-year ended February 28
1998, to RM174.50 million from RM43.48 million.
	   He also said MRCB's results for the half-year ended February 28
1998, which saw its pre-tax profit falling 65 per cent to RM51.94
million from RM147.93 million, did not come as a surprise
considering the current situation.

	   HE IS Melbourne's most prolific CBD (central business district)
property buyer. He is managing director of one of the country's
fastest-growing listed companies. And he can sniff out a capital
gain from 100 paces.
	   But the high profile activities of lawyer Jason Yeap, a former
Malaysian citizen, are in sharp contrast to the way he likes to do
business.
	   Despite a track record of savvy counter cyclical property plays
which have put him in the limelight, the quiet Yeap and his stash
of wealthy Asian investors firmly shun the attention.
	   On a public front, however, he is willing to talk about his
latest venture with the recent relaunch of listed company Phileo
Australia. In less than two years he has increased assets from a
mere A$2 million to more than A$60 million, and has managed to
snare some of the city's prime redevelopment sites before most
people even realised they were valuable.
	   But it is Yeap's private client deals that keep the market
ticking over and the market watchers fascinated.
	   In the past five years he has spent more than A$200 million
buying properties throughout Melbourne on behalf of overseas
investors as an adviser and lawyer.
	   At the moment, interests he represents control 15 Melbourne CBD
office buildings, including seven along the prime Collins Street
office strip.
	   He also has another five or so, `I've never had to add them up
before', on city fringes to make a current portfolio of 20
buildings.
	   Making money from property involves a simple formula, Yeap says,
despite multi-billion dollar losses by the big expert banks,
institutions and developers during the last slump. `Basically, we
look for undervalued assets in the best addresses,' he tells
Malaysian Business.
	   `Of course potential capital gain is our main driving force,
either through value growth over a period of time or we improve the
assets and the value increases from that improvement.
	   `I like to pick the best address in a city and in Melbourne
that's Collins Street. Our next best would be Queen Street and then
Bourke,' he adds.
	   Melbourne's landmark former stock exchange building is to be the
next project off the starting blocks after last year receiving
approval for a new office and residential tower at 357 Collins
Street.
	   The planned transformation of the derelict drab 1960s building
includes 20,000 sq m of office space, a 130-room hotel and about 80
apartments.
	   Yeap expects to launch the project within the next couple of
months on behalf of its owner, a syndicate of Malaysian investors
called Maxicity.
	   But it is the public activities through Phileo that look set to
make the next set of headlines. After re-listing in August 1996,
the former Renak Holdings has leaped from acquisition to
acquisition. It has amalgamated a portfolio of significant assets,
including the huge General Motors Holden site in Melbourne's outer
suburbs.
	   The company plans to build one of the biggest industrial parks
in Australia, with the 41 ha property eventually to house more than
200,000 sq m of buildings space.
	   In an equally bold project, Phileo also snared the sought-after
former Tram Depot in South Melbourne last year and virtually within
hours had carved off a large slice of the site and on-sold it to
developer Central Equity - at a profit, of course.
	   On the bulk of the remaining South Melbourne site, the company
intends to build one of the first major new office projects in the
city since the market slump in the early 1990s.
	   A seven ha residential parcel in Melbourne's suburban heartland
of Box Hill is another of the group's new projects while a whole
block on prime Port Melbourne is also earmarked for about 200
units.
	   Phileo (a Greek word meaning friendship) is controlled by
Malaysian-based Phileo Land and its investment, including an A$11
million injection last year, may prove to be a good hedge against
uncertainty.
	   Despite the ongoing roller coaster in the Asian markets, Yeap
says the biggest hurdle of the meltdown has already been overcome -
`fear of the unknown'.
	   `What has happened is now already known. When the crises started
we could see no end but now we know there are some deep problems in
Indonesia, in Korea and Thailand. But because they are now known
factors we can budget and manage from here onwards,' he says.
	   `As a business person who looks forward, it should not be
something that we are fearful of, it should be something that we
must consider. Not something that we are so scared of that it
paralyses us and we get nothing done.' Few, if any, Asian-based
buyers will retreat or sell their assets because of financial
pressure. `I'm not talking about the people who may buy a A$200,000
apartment, who could be hit hard - but I'm talking about those
people who have spent A$15 million or A$20 million buying an asset
in Collins Street.'

	   THE Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology
(Might) is currently undertaking an aerospace industry inventory
exercise to identify the players in the local industry.
	   Its chief executive, Dr Ahmed Tasir Lope Pihie, speaking to
Business Times over the weekend, said the first draft of the
inventory is expected to be ready in two months.
	   The inventory exercise is among the 45 recommendations and
implementation plans outlined by Might in the Blueprint for the
Aerospace Industry in Malaysia.
	   The blueprint, which will pilot the flight of the country's
aerospace industry, outlines the key implementation programmes to
be undertaken by the public and private sectors of the industry.
	   The Government has identified the aerospace industry as a
critical constituent of the country's future industrial base. The
industry has been accorded a priority status in the Seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000).
	   Both civil and military aircraft and equipment, satellites and
space equipment, and related products and services fall within the
ambit of the aerospace industry.
	   It also includes aircraft maintenance, overhaul, repair and
upgrading, manufacturing of aircraft, satellites, missiles and
space vehicles, provision of infrastructure such as airports and
launching pads for rockets, research and development activities and
systems integration.
	   Dr Ahmed Tasir said the agency is sourcing information from its
own MIGHT Interest Group on Aviation and the International Trade
and Industry Ministry, which has a cluster working group on
aviation.
	   Under the blueprint, the structure of the Malaysian aerospace
industry will see the consolidation of the efforts of the key
aerospace operators in Malaysia namely the Armed Forces, Malaysia
Airlines and Malaysia Airports Bhd together with other general
aviation companies.
	   Engineering and manufacturing activities will be anchored in
companies such as MAS Aerotechnologies, SME Group of Companies,
RMAF Engineering and Phileo Aviation.
	   ``We are not saying that there will be a physical consolidation
of the companies in the aerospace industry, but we would like to
see a consolidation in terms of efforts and resources,'' he said.
	   Among the other programmes covered under the blueprint include:
Manufacturing: Expanding parts and components manufacturing to
enable the country to be a leader in upgrading and re-manufacturing
activities.
	   General aviation: To be a regional player in general aviation
activities and a major player in the manufacture of light aircraft.
	   Space: To be significantly involved in the utilisation of space
for both commercial and strategic reasons.
	   Systems: To be a major player in aerospace systems technology
(including avionics); and Commercial aviation: Preferred
transportation hub of and for the region.
	   Among the projects to be undertaken are for technology
acquisition, human resource development, space, composite
procurement, vendor development, surveillance, defence and
satellites.
	   These programmes will, by the year 2015, enable Malaysia to have
a cohesive and developed industrial base with aerospace
capabilities, capability and competency at company and individual
levels, a degree of technological independence, savings by
obviating the need for foreign purchases, a sustainable national
defence capability and enjoy the spin-off benefits useful in other
industries.
	   Might will also undertake a roadshow to explain the content of
the blueprint to government agencies and the private sector
companies.
	   ``We have done one at Universiti Utara Malaysia, explaining the
blueprint and the respective roles of the government agencies and
the private sector in the scheme of things,'' he said.

	   HAVING established itself as the tea with the ummph, Boh
Plantations Sdn Bhd intends to be the tea specialist in the market,
for everyone ranging from six-star hotels to teh tarik stalls.
	   Its executive director and general manager Caroline Russel says
Boh's mission is to be a world-class Malaysian brand, competing
against the best from anywhere in the world. According to Russel,
while Malaysians have been drinking Boh Tea since the 1930s, it was
only in the late 50s that a concerted effort was made to market the
product domestically. In the 30s, most of the tea was exported in
bulk to London.
	   Russel hails from the family of John Archibald Russel, a tea
producer and pioneer of highland tea cultivation, who established
Boh Plantations in 1929. Boh Plantations has since stopped
exporting its tea to London in bulk, and now, all the prime grades
of tea produced by the company are sold in a branded form.
	   Boh Plantations manages four estates: Boh; Fairlie and Sungei
Palas Estates in Cameron Highlands; and a lowland estate - Bukit
Cheeding - in Banting, Selangor. With a total planted area of 1,200
hectares, Boh Plantations produces 3.7 million kilogrammes of tea a
year, or approximately five million cups of tea per day.
	   As consumers become more sophisticated and discerning, Boh is
moving towards a bolder and brighter corporate image. `In addition
to increasing sophistication, the profile of the Malaysian market
is becoming much younger with 44 per cent of the population being
below the age of 19,' says Russel. `This presents a huge challenge
to marketeers, especially those of long-established brands. Brands
like Boh are in danger of being perceived as old-fashioned, boring
and irrelevant to the youth market. A product that one's
grandmother purchased may not fit in with a young person's
self-image. We see the threat of younger consumers moving away from
tea to soft drinks, as what is happening in the United States where
Coke is a regular breakfast drink. We feel there is an urgent need
to reposition tea as a healthy and great tasting refreshment, the
choice even of a generation bombarded with MTV,' explains Russel.
She adds, `So, it is also our mission to revitalise and rejuvenate
the concept of tea here in Malaysia.' The launch of Boh's new
corporate identity, according to her, is aimed at fulfilling both
the objectives of establishing Boh as a world-class brand and as
the beverage of choice for Malaysia's youthful market. `We
recognise the need to contemporise the Boh brand, refresh and
update its image while retaining its heritage and core values of
quality and value.
	   We want to re-emphasise the Cameron Highlands origin of Boh and
the unique character of our teas, embodied in the phrase ``Boh ada
ummph!''' The new identity will be reflected in all aspects of the
brand - from new products to packaging to all marketing
communication tools, from the Internet to advertising.
	   `While the typography in the brand logo type is true to the
original and remains strong, it has greater clarity and definition.
The detailing lifts the profile of the brand, and it injects a
sophistication and refinement that reinforces Boh as a brand
synonymous with fine quality tea. At the same time, a more
contemporary look has been achieved.
	   `The diagonal graphics and the brown and orange colour schemes
have always been, and will remain, strong, proprietary parts of
Boh's packaging, instantly recognisable to the consumer. Brown is
the colour of heritage and establishment, dependable and constant.
Orange is in direct antithesis, reflecting zest, innovation and
creativity.
	   `Together, they reflect the qualities of earth and nourishment,
soil and sunshine, two of the essential components in the
production of fine quality tea leaves. This unique scheme will
continue to form the visual identity of the packaging, and is the
link by which the Boh brand is, and will continue to be,
recognised,' details Russel.
	   The new packaging for products like teabags, potbags, loose
leaves and iced tea has been designed to revitalise Boh's identity.
The colours have been enhanced, new ones introduced and graphics
restyled. Product descriptions have been revised to reflect the
long heritage and unique selling points of tea grown in Cameron
Highlands.
	   Boh's new identity is also expressed in the range of products
that the company now markets. Each product is designed to cater to
the needs of specific consumer groups, from the tea connoisseur, to
the health enthusiast, to the stressed office worker, to the
overseas tourist. Its product catalogue now includes the garden
teas, Seri Songket flavoured teas, fruit and herbal infusions,
specialty black teas, iced tea and three-in-one instant tea mix.
The garden teas, targeted at the gift market and discerning tea
drinker, is a range of Boh's own-grown, pure, unblended teas from a
single tea garden.
	   Tea can be likened to wine; its character and flavour are
directly influenced by environmental conditions such as the climate
and soil of the place in which it is grown. Similarly, the range of
specialty black teas allow tea drinkers to experience selected
unblended original teas from renowned tea-growing regions of the
world.
	   Recently, Boh also launched a range of instant iced tea mixes in
Peach, Lemon Lime and Orchard Splash flavours, which are targeted
directly at the youth market.

At Entertainment drops Poland's Canal Plus in cable TV enterprise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The U.S.-based At Entertainment Inc. said
Monday it had dropped plans to develop a digital pay-TV service in
Poland with Canal Plus, and that it would develop one alone.
	   The two companies had signed a letter of intent for the joint
venture but could not agree on details before a May 31 deadline,
said Przemyslaw Szmyt, a deputy president of At Entertainment.
	   Szmyt declined to discuss details of the talks between the two
companies. Canal Plus Poland, a subsidiary of Europe's largest
cable TV company Canal Plus, declined to comment.
	   At Entertainment plans to start its own digital TV service in
September, Szmyt said.
	   The Hartford, Connecticut-based company already runs the largest
cable television network in Poland reaching 800,000 homes. It is to
launch an additional cable TV network this week, Szmyt said.

	   HARVARD: India evoked strong reactions from around the world
with its nuclear tests. It received adverse press and evoked the
anger of major powers and President Clinton imposed sanctions.
	   India's neighbour, Pakistan, replied with its own nuclear tests
evoking even stronger reactions. Its tests outnumbered its
neighbour, which is also being subjected to sanctions.
	   India is not being spared for setting off the ``nuclear arms''
race in Asia. But while India may have received considerable press,
the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) sprang into action to
present India's views. It took full page advertisments, including
in the Financial Times of London.
	   The advertisment was a public relations exercise and at the same
time presented India's story and where it is heading in terms of
the economy.
	   The CII, in defending the Indian Government's nuclear tests,
said they ``
	   ... were carried out because of serious national security
concerns, especially the nuclear environment in the region''. It
added that `` ... the internationl focus must remain on Economic
Opportunities and Economic Partnership''.
	   In the advertisement entitled ``India: The High Growth Market
Opportunity'', the CII listed out the agenda for growth, the
business opportunities, economic vision and the government and
private sector consensus on economic reform.
	   The CII is not alone in adopting this strategy. Microsoft, taken
to task by the US Government which has filed anti-trust lawsuits
against the company, also ``told its story'' in a full page
advertisment in the New York Times.
	   Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft wrote an open letter to ``Customers,
Partners and Shareholders'' telling his side of the story in the
anti-trust lawsuits against his 23-year-old company.
	   He explained, in his own words, that ``This is an industry built
on innovation, competition and consumer choice - principles that
America's anti-trust laws were designed to promote, and that have
always been a cornerstone of Microsoft's business practices.''
	   Mobil outlined three steps for the US to take in dealing with
Iran, namely, allow US companies to negotiate deals with Iran,
contingent on the lifting of sanctions; allow US companies to swap
oil with Iran; and grant a limited waiver to use Iranian equipment
in the Caspian Sea.
	   This ``advice'' came hot on the heels of Washington's
announcement to waive sanctions against Petronas, France's Total
and Russia's Gazprom for investments in Iran's oil sector. Under
the Iran Libya Sanctions Act, the companies would have been
penalised for investing in Iran.
	   The three cases - CII, Microsoft and Mobil - all have one thing
in common. They were fast off the starting blocks to present their
side of the story. They did not wait for the media to pick up and
tell their story for them. They chose to do it themselves, thus
preventing any misrepresentation and misinterpretation.
	   Telling one's own story as it is, is essential. The CII, Bill
Gates and Mobil had compelling reasons to ``tell their side of the
story'' and found it necessary to take full page advertisments. The
media has its own bias and many feel that the media, both print and
electronic, may not present the facts as they should be in their
news stories.
	   Developing countries, including Malaysia and its business
community, need to learn from these companies to tell their own
story. With the incresingly biased and opinionated news and feature
stories, it is time concerted efforts are made to ``tell Malaysia's
story''. While the government leadership, Prime Minister and Deputy
Prime Minister continue to do their part, it is important for the
private sector and the business community to play a greater part in
this area.
	   While small steps have been taken with the onset of the crisis,
they are insufficient to have the required and intended impact. The
continued presence in the popular press needs to be maintained.
	   The Western media is a powerful tool, even if it does not report
accurately all the time. It is a problem for small and helpless
countries, companies and individuals in presenting their stories.
	   Thus, the collective action of the CII can and should be
emulated by organisations to present their side of the story and
that of the countries in which they operate and have their base.
	   The Malaysian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, for example,
can together with other chambers of commerce and industry groups
present the economic potential in the country. It is time the
business community and entrepreneurs ``sell'' the potential to
foreign investors and businesses.
	   Malaysia's economic fundamentals remain unchanged despite the
currency crisis. These need to be brought to the attention of the
people who matter - decision makers, businessmen and fund managers.
Who would be in a better position to speak to his counterparts, the
foreign businessmen, if not his fellow businessmen and
entrepreneurs with operations in Malaysia.
	   Thus, as the CII has shown, the situation cannot be that
hopeless. It takes courage to face the challenge, onslaught and
condemnation from the world, including the most powerful economies.
In the final analysis, it is the citizens, shareholders and owners
who have to fight for their own country and company. If they do
not, no one else will.

	   MEET Darryl Carlton. He's the chairman and chief executive
officer (CEO) of Datek Sdn Bhd, the first Multimedia Super Corridor
status firm to launch a Made-in-Malaysia software development tool,
Batavia.
	   Early in May, Datek achieved a coup of sorts when forty million
viewers across the US and Canada got a virtual tour of its software
development facility in Petaling Jaya. NBC, a major US television
network featured Datek on its ``Technology Today'' show.
	   Carlton, with 23 years in the computer industry, is unafraid to
speak his mind on such issues as the use of local expertise and
software piracy.
	   Batavia, the first software development tool written in the Java
programming language to come out of the Multimedia Super Corridor,
was developed by a team made up largely of Malaysian software
engineers.
	   Carlton stresses, ``If I were in Silicon Valley I would still
use the same expertise that I have now.''
	   And as for software piracy, he quipped, ``The American firms who
are screaming the loudest about software piracy are the very ones
who charge 50 per cent extra in Asia for their products, which are
also very difficult to purchase here.''
	   The 42-year-old CEO, who is ``totally opposed to piracy'' also
voiced his frustration over the inability to purchase software via
the Net. He said that quite a few major corporations will not
accept credit cards issued in Asia.
	   Carlton who hails from Melbourne, did not learn about computers
and software in the cloistered halls of well-known technical
institutes but rather from being on-the-job.
	   He in fact comes from a family where three generations have been
in the newspaper business. It's not surprising then that he said,
``I worked for one year with the Melbourne Age when I was 17
years.''
	   In some ways, Carlton's link to the world of print continues,
for he has written quite often for Computimes. These days, he
writes less frequently due to growing business responsibilities.
	   Datek's boss started working in the computer industry at the age
of 18 as a trainee computer operator in 1975. ``The first computer
I worked on was from GE,'' he said, adding that ``it had no
keyboard, no screen, and used punched cards and punched tape.''
	   ``I started my first business in Australia in 1980 and that
lasted two years,'' he said. In 1990, he began his second business
that was operational until he moved to Malaysia in 1996 ``when I
transferred all of the assets and intellectual property of that
business to Datek''.
	   He has personally invested RM10 million in the Malaysian
company, proof of his belief in the nation's Information Technology
(IT) commitment and he waxes enthusiastic about Malaysia's
``forward-looking'' stance.
	   Carlton says, ``Compared with Australia, Malaysia has great
vision.''
	   ``How many countries actually have a stated corporate strategy
for the country?'' he queried.
	   ``The fact that Malaysia has Vision 2020 is a dramatic
improvement over those countries that don't have one. Most
politicians in the world have a vision to win the next election and
that's about it.
	   ``Here you have a country with a government that actually has
thought about the future.''
	   When relating why he chose Malaysia to base his company, he
said, ``I can give you a host of business reasons as to why
Malaysia is a really good place to operate but the reason I gave
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad was that the food is
better here.''
	   In a more serious vein, Carlton added, ``The reason I came here
was -this is a growth economy and the country is committed to IT
and it's committed to moving away from manufacturing and tourism.
	   ``The country's also committed to creating a sort of
environment, where if you are a business person with ideas, you
have a better than reasonable chance of being successful with those
ideas.''
	   He added that that is all a business person seeks. ``No one
really wants guarantees,'' he said, ``no one expects guarantees ...
no one cares about handouts, what they want is the ability to do
their best and this is what Malaysia provides.''
	   Prior to his coming to Malaysia, he said, ``I was doing business
process engineering for very, very large corporations around the
world and increasingly more and more of my business was coming from
Asia.
	   ``But everytime I did work in Asia and got on a plane to go home
... I was losing business.''
	   He continued, ``So I had to make a decision. In order to do
business in Asia, I had to be in Asia. The next challenge of
course, was well if I'm going to be in Asia - where and why?''
	   He downplayed the MSC as being the main inducement to set up
business here. ``We decided to come here before the MSC took shape.
We came here because the Government in Malaysia was already
committed to technology.''
	   He said, Vision 2020 creates a very different climate. ``You
have a climate in the main,'' Carlton said, ``where businesses are
very forward-looking, in the main where the Government is very
forward-looking and people are looking to the future and what it
means.''
	   Commenting on current economic woes, he stressed that in
Malaysia, the economy will get worse before it gets better.
	   ``The economic problems here will drive out those companies
which are basically badly-managed today and have been able to be
successful because of the economy's general growth.''
	   As a result of the downturn, he said, the badly-run companies
will not survive and ``therefore when the country does recover, it
will recover in a dramatically better state, a higher quality state
than it was previously in''.
	   As a manufacturer of intellectual products, which Datek is, the
depreciation of the ringgit provides cost advantages to the firm in
the world market, said Carlton.
	   The tightening labour market, he said frankly, boosted his
ability to hire high quality staff and retain them at lower rates.
From an investment point of view, he said, the tough economic
situation improved many aspects of Datek's business.
	   ``It provides us with the opportunity to basically be a
`contrarian investor' ... we are dramatically increasing our
investment. Now is the time to build products and export products
... not to hunker down in your shell and protect yourself.''
	   And this is precisely what Datek is doing. ``We are coming out
with a couple of new products,'' says Carlton. ``We are
re-engineering Batavia as a workstation product.''
	   ``The next version (of Batavia) which will come out in September
will be the enterprise edition,'' said Carlton, adding that the
enterprise edition will not be sold on the Net but directly and
will be available from Datek's distributors. It will cost about
US$10,000.
	   ``What we expect from our website is to make fairly healthy
sales (of the first Batavia version) and generate awareness of our
products,'' he said.
	   The firm will also introduce accounting software called `eXacct
Financials' at the end of July.
	   Touching briefly on the disadvantages of current economic
problems, Carlton said as a result of this ``there is less
liquidity in the market if you decide to go public''.
	   And as for Asia's problems, he said in his forthright manner,
the ``economies must and will survive''.

<TEXT>
	   HEWLETT-PACKARD Co, the well-known manufacturer of flatbed
colour scanners, has rolled out its new HP ScanJet 5100C which is
targeted at the small office-home office (SOHO) market.
	   The ScanJet 5100C uses HP intelligent scanning technology
designed to automatically detect different types of scanned items
and optimises its scan settings such as resolution, bit depth and
image type.
	   Using a single-pass for both colour and monochrome images, the
ScanJet 5100C comes with 300 dots per inch optical resolution, 300
by 600dpi hardware and 1200dpi enhanced resolution.
	   Other features of the scanner include a 30-bit converter and
36-bit colour image processor.
	   The scanner also supports a maximum document size of up to 8.5
inches by 11.7in (216 millimetres by 297mm).
	   Measuring 124.8mm, 306mm and 485.1mm (height, width and length)
in dimensions, the printer takes quite a lot of space when placed
next to the personal computer (PC).
	   The product comes with one scan button which is used for
scanning purposes. Before installing and using the scanner, do not
forget to unlock the scanhead. It is normally locked especially
during transportation to protect it from damage.
	   The ScanJet 5100C uses an enhanced parallel port interface.
Thus, connecting the scanner to the PC is as easy as connecting a
printer. All you have to do is plug the cable into the printer's
port at the back of the PC and the other end at the scanner's port.
Then plug the power cord into the electrical outlet.
	   The scanner comes with the HP PrecisionScan which is the
scanning software.
	   There are basically two resolution modes available for scanning
-default and custom. The default mode scans at 150dpi while the
latter gives you the options to choose the required scan
resolution.
	   You can also choose the scanning speed - normal or faster scan
speed.
	   The normal scan speed is a default and aimed for best-quality
photographs, text, or black and white drawings.
	   Faster scan speed comes with two more options: the first option
is to scan best-quality photographs while the latter can be used
for best-quality text and also black and white drawings.
	   A colour image was scanned in both modes of the resolution using
normal scan speed.
	   The quality of the image was good for both resolutions but it
was, of course, even better when using the 300dpi in custom
resolution. The scanner also did not make much noise during the
scanning process.
	   When scanning colour images, there were several options of
format to save them. The same also applies for the text documents,
which you can save as a text file or even in Microsoft Word or
WordPad format.
	   Speaking of text, a text document was scanned and saved in
WordPad.
	   Overall, the text was readable although there were few words
that needed to be edited manually.
	   The ScanJet 5100C comes with a one-year warranty and the package
includes the scanner, parallel cable, power cord, scanner driver
and user manual.

	   AIRBUS Industrie signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with
the Engine Alliance to offer the GP7200 series of engines on its
A3XX family of aircraft.
	   The MOU was signed during the 4th A3XX Programme Progress Review
in Cannes, France.
	   Developed to meet the needs of the A3XX family, the GP7200 will
cover the 67,000-pound to 80,000-pound thrust range.
	   The A3XX is the first application for this new engine and for
the Engine Alliance as its supplier. It offers higher levels of
fuel efficiency and better noise characteristics than any engine in
its class flying today.
	   This agreement will provide the A3XX with a choice of engine
supplier, as an MOU had already been signed between Airbus
Industrie and Rolls-Royce for the Trent 900 engine in October 1996.
	   The 4th A3XX Programme Progress Review has gathered together
representatives of 14 airlines with members of the A3XX team,
including both engine suppliers, in the presence of Airbus
Industrie's managing director Noel Forgeard.
	   Airline focal points have been able to validate the progress
achieved towards meeting A3XX performance goals and the innovative
approach being applied to ensure that the A3XX becomes a reference
for international travel.
	   Mr Forgeard welcomed the signature of the MOU with the Engine
Alliance, saying ``Our customers expressed a preference for a
choice of engines on the A3XX programme. We are pleased to offer
that choice and encourage a healthy competition to provide the best
product to the market.''
	   The meeting demonstrates the continuing support of the world's
leading airlines for the A3XX family concept, covering capacities
of 480 to 650 seats and ranges from 7,650 nautical miles to 8,750
nautical miles (14,200km-16,200km) as well as short range, Combi
and Freighter variants.
	   The A3XX is scheduled for launch in 1999 and entry into airline
service in the third quarter of 2004.

Seven people sentenced in pyramid scheme scandal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Seven people involved in last year's
failed pyramid schemes, which cost thousands of Macedonians their
savings, received sentences Monday ranging from fines to prison
time.
	   Some 23,000 Macedonians lost the equivalent of dlrs 65.8 million
in late 1996 with the collapse of so-called pyramid schemes, which
offer high interest rates and use new deposits to pay earlier
investors.
	   The biggest failure was of the Tat company, based in Bitolj,
some 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the capital, Skopje.
	   Owner Sonja Nikolovska proclaimed her innocence and blamed the
collapse on Macedonian companies that she claimed owed her an
equivalent of dlrs 58 million. She was sentenced to eight years in
prison.
	   Four people who worked in government finance offices in Bitolj
also received prison terms. Julijana Atanasova, head of the finance
office, was sentenced to five years in prison.
	   Employees Sogka Jancevska, Jonce Bocevski and Boris Mijalcev
received sentences ranging from one year to three months.
	   Siljan Micevski, the former mayor of Bitolj, received a one-year
suspended sentence, while his wife, Violeta, was fined the
equivalent of dlrs 882.
	   All were accused of falsifying documents for Nikolovska and
helped her avoid paying taxes.
	   The scandal in Macedonia sparked fears of violence similar to
that in neighboring Albania, where the failure of pyramid schemes
led to armed insurrection last year.
	   The Macedonian government has proposed a gradual compensation
plan.

<TEXT>
	   FOR the past nine years, the Association of the Computer
Industry Malaysia (Pikom) and Computimes have worked together to
recognise excellence in information technology through the annual
IT Awards.
	   The practice of identifying outstanding organisations, products
and content in IT for their contributions continues with the 1998
Pikom-Computimes IT Awards. As in the past years, the aim is to
give recognition to organisations making effective use of IT, and
hardware, software and content developers who excel in their
fields.
	   The awards have produced an impressive list of winners, with
locally-developed offerings that not only made an impact locally
but were also able to compete internationally.
	   With the current emphasis on Made-in-Malaysia products,
competition in the various categories of the IT Awards is expected
to be more intense, and even more interesting.
	   To ensure that the entries received meet the requirements given,
a technical evaluation committee has been set up.
	   The committee, headed by Stacks Technology Sdn Bhd's managing
director Nah Soo Hoe, comprises representatives from the Government
and the private sector.
	   At a recent meeting, the organising committee decided that the
categories for the IT Awards should remain at six.
	   However, based on the feedback received, the IT Product of the
Year (Systems) category has been scrapped as it was difficult to
evaluate and attracted the least number of entries each year.
	   Instead, the software category was expanded to cover IT Product
of the Year (Software: Application) and IT Product of the Year
(Software: Internet-based Application), taking into account current
trends in the industry.
	   The six categories in this year's IT Awards are: IT Organisation
of the Year - for a local organisation or Government body which has
been successful in using IT effectively; IT Product of the Year
(Hardware) -for commercially available product with at least 30 per
cent local content or design; IT Product of the Year (Software:
Application) - for commercially available software application of
local design; IT Product of the Year (Software: Internet-based
Application) - for commercially available Internet-based
application of local design; Internet Web site of the Year - for
locally-developed Web site which has been successful in helping an
organisation or community; and Multimedia CD-Title of the Year -
for locally-developed multimedia compact disk title which has made
the most impact.
	   Pikom's chairman Shaifubahrim Saleh said the organisers are
expecting more entries this year, and the process to make
nominations has been simplified.
	   Nominations for the awards are now open. To nominate, either
visit the Pikom Web site at www. pikom.org.my or call Fahiza at
Tel: 03-2920297. The deadline for entries is July 27. The award
presentation will be held at the Pikom annual dinner on Nov 26.

	   THE call to buy Malaysian is not a call to buy inferior
products, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said last
night.
	   ``World-class jeans are made in Malaysia. High-quality
electronic components are manufactured in Malaysia. We can make
cars and lorries in Malaysia that can be exported,'' he told a
crowd of some 20,000 people at the ``Semarakkan Semangat Cinta
Malaysia'' performance organised by the Malaysian Chinese
Association in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Dr Mahathir said Malaysian-made goods are ``different from
before'' and the country has been making products for the world.
	   Foreign goods, he said, are not necessarily better; in fact, he
added, many foreign brands have Malaysian-made components.
	   ``When we called for buying of Malaysian-made products, we are
not urging the rakyat to buy inferior goods. We simply urge them to
buy local products as this can help to strengthen the economy.''
	   He said buying local will help reduce the outflow of the ringgit
while at the same time improve the local businesses.
	   ``It is most critical to protect our currency, and this can be
done by buying Malaysian-made products ... This gives strength for
us to fight the present economic problems,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said Malaysians should support campaigns on buying
locally- made goods.
	   ``When we buy Malaysian-made products, it shows that we love the
country and willing to sacrifice to defend the nation and its
economy ... Malaysia belongs to all of us. If we don't, who else
would love this nation?''
	   Dr Mahathir said the Government will do everything it can to
defend the country and ensure it weathers the economic storm.
	   He also called on the people to act rationally and sensibly in
dealing with the problems facing them as a result of the region's
financial crisis.
	   ``In other multi-racial nations, there are problems and even
racial riots due to the crisis. In Malaysia, we do not have this.
No race in Malaysia is living in fear or feeling threatened. This
is our advantage. We must value this,'' he added.
	   The country's balanced economic development as well as the
strong unity of its multi-racial population are the country's edge
in overcoming the current downturn.
	   Dr Mahathir said the country's racial harmony is intact because
all the races in Malaysia are sensitive to one another's feelings.

German dancer, film star, writer Lotti Huber dies at 85 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Lotti Huber, a pre-World War II cabaret dancer who
escaped Nazi persecution and reclaimed fame in Germany in the 1980s
with a film career, died Sunday at age 85.
	   Huber died at a Berlin hospital after suffering a heart attack
Friday, her friend and former stage partner Thomas Nowotny said.
	   Huber's launch into cult status began at age 67 with the 1979
film ``Gigolo,'' in which she danced and appeared in a scene with
film's lead, rock star David Bowie.
	   She then netted lead roles in films during the 1980s by the
openly homosexual German director Rosa von Praunheim, including
``Our Corpses are Alive,'' and ``Horror Vacui,'' in which Huber
played a sect leader.
	   She wrote a memoir entitled ``This Lemon Still Has a Lot of
Juice.''
	   Born in 1912 in Kiel to a Jewish family, Huber became a cabaret
dancer in Berlin. Because of her relationship with a German man,
the Nazi government convicted her of ``racial disgrace'' in 1937
and imprisoned her in a concentration camp.
	   An American organization secured her release a year later, and
she emigrated to British-controlled Palestine and married a British
colonel. After her stint as a cabaret dancer in Cairo, Egypt, the
couple settled in Cyprus and ran a hotel together until their
divorce in 1955.
	   She returned to Germany in 1965.
	   There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral
arrangements.

	   US-BASED Plus Corp has introduced into the local market its
latest projector which features digital light processing (DLP)
projection technology with the aim of providing more quality
display.
	   According to the company, the PLUS UP-800 projector also
incorporates a proprietary optical engine which features a
spherical surface lens that delivers a higher level of brightness,
resolution, focus and colour uniformity compared to other
projectors.
	   The optical engine is designed to enhance the amount and quality
of light generated to recreate an image in a DLP projector,
delivering 100 per cent reproduction of the original information
100 per cent of the time.
	   Plus said the projector is able to deliver bright colours and
clear image of any liquid crystal display (LCD) and DLP projector
weighing under 4.5 kilograms. DLP is a reflective technology which
increases the amount of light that gets from the lamp to the screen
compared to other display technologies.
	   According to Plus, the new digital projector is the first
ultra-portable projector of its kind to deliver 600 ANSI lumens of
brightness packaged in the size of a notebook personal computer
(PC).
	   The product is a super video graphics array (SVGA) with 800 by
600 pixels resolution projector with the ability to process XGA
data using intelligent compression technology. This new technology
allows the compressed signal to be projected in its entirety
without the usual loss of lines of resolution associated with
signal compression.
	   Furthermore, using innovative intelligent expansion technology,
both video graphics array (VGA) and video signals are projected at
a full raster. Plus said. It added that this means that the VGA and
video images will automatically be expanded to fill the entire
screen.
	   The projector also features a digital zoom function or focus
lens of up to 400 per cent, a 1,000-hour user replaceable metal
halide lamp, a contrast ratio 180:1, 24-bit, 16.7 million colour
reproduction, a multi-lingual text menu display, a full function
wireless remote control and a soft-carrying case.
	   The entire projector measures 9.25 inches in width, 12.2in in
length and 3.85in in height. Targeted at travelling executives, the
new digital projector is now available at RM22,500 from local
distributor Eastern Office Machines Sdn Bhd (EOM) and its channel
of dealers and resellers.
	   EOM expects to sell between 2,000 and 2,200 units of the Plus
UP-800 projector this year.

	   ANYONE who's been driving on our highways for any length of time
will surely have stories to tell of lucky escapes from road
accidents. Just the very thing happened when Malaysian Business
test-drove the Ford Explorer 4-litre XLT sport utility vehicle
(it's Yankee-speak for 4WD) recently.
	   That life was spared and limb intact, was in no small measure
due to the Explorer's rugged reliability. Overcome with grateful
relief, a colleague who sat in the passenger seat chanted an
involuntary `mantra': `Thank you XLT, I'm getting home safely.'
(More about this `near-accident' later).
	   The Ford Explorer XLT is an American import first launched
locally in July last year. It comes with the reputation of being
the `World's Best-selling' 4-by-4, and is credited with creating a
huge growth in interest in the sports and recreational utility
vehicle market in the United States. This trend has been
transplanted to other markets in the United Kingdom, Australia,
Thailand, Japan and South America.
	   One would think anything stamped Uncle Sam would naturally be
big and brash. This Explorer (there is a limited, upmarket model
called the Explorer Limited) is big without being brash. Neither is
it flashy. A pair of large `wraparound' headlamps split between a
chromium-plated front grille gives it a commanding but understated
presence. Its wheelbase measures well over 4.78 metres, making it
longer than the Range Rover or many of its Japanese rivals. Yet it
is lighter, having a kerb weight of just over 1,950 kg.
	   A feature which sets the Explorer XLT apart from other 4WDs is
Control Trac - a true on-demand 'smart' 4WD traction control
system. Control Trac is operated by a simple three-position rotary
knob on the dashboard and needs no secondary levers to clutter
floor space or complicate driving routines.
	   The Explorer XLT has deep windows that afford excellent
all-round visibility. Rather than being hinged on to the rear door,
the spare wheel is stored out of sight. The vehicle boasts stylish
wheel arch flares and side sill skirts, tasteful chrome highlights
and a classy exterior colour range. Sitting high above the traffic,
yet avoiding the `tall boy' stance of many 4WD vehicles, the Ford
Explorer has a commanding presence on the highway.
	   Safety concerns are given top priority in the Explorer. All have
dual front airbags, 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, anti-submarining
front seats, outboard seatbelt lockers, adjustable front seatbelt
upper mountings, cargo tie-down hooks and limited-slip rear axle.
The front sections of the Explorer XLT's separate chassis have
controlled collapse rates engineered to help absorb frontal and
offset front crash forces. Doors enclose side-impact protection
beams and the body incorporates a cabin safety cage, part of which
is a major composite cross car beam behind the instrument panel.
The steering wheel frame is magnesium which has crash energy
absorption and noise/vibration suppression qualities superior to
the steel usually used.
	   Internally, the dashboard controls not only look neat but they
are also well-laid out and functional to boot. The Explorer XLT has
a single stalk wiper and lamp controls to the left of the steering
wheel - no confusing which controls what.
	   On the minus side? The Autocruise control could do with a little
refinement. Looking extremely functional, the thumb-activated pads
require a degree of concentrated exertion (it feels hard to the
touch) to operate.
	   Climbing in requires some effort for those of us who are not
physically too well-endowed; the Explorer XLT could do with
side-steps. The seats are a little on the firm side, but this can
easily be remedied by placing one of those therapeutic cushions
easily available from auto accessory outlets.
	   After all that, you are now ready to hear about that
`near-accident' story. Friday afternoon on the Federal Highway and
this driver had just collected the Explorer for the weekend
testdrive. Most drivers are struggling to stay awake at the wheel
with the airconditioning turned on full-blast. The bitumen on the
road surface has a treacly appearance, having baked all day at an
El Nino-induced 37 degrees Celsius. First protaganist: a woman
driver in a shiny new compact car in the middle lane heading
towards the city. For no apparent reason, she chugs along at just
under 60kmph which riles protaganist 2 - a male driver of an
articulated lorry minus the trailer. Pulling on to her rear, he
clearly indicates his intentions: `Move aside, lady, and stop
hogging the middle lane as if you were out on a Sunday drive!'
`Miss Piggy' - that's a female road hog -doesn't get the hint.
	   Exasperated, the driver tries to pass on the inside lane, where
protaganist 3 - two men in a beat-up 1.3 litre saloon - is moving
forward, fastest of the three! The lorry grazes the car on the left
with its left front fender. The car's speed causes it to be shunted
forward and once brakes are applied, is spun 90 degrees to the
right while stuck to the front fender of the articulated lorry. The
car's front fender grazes the left rear of `Miss Piggy's' compact
which is propelled forward and spun 180 degrees. Pandemonium! The
Explorer XLT was right behind the articulated lorry. Why didn't we
become protaganist 4 - and another statistic of everyday road
mayhem?
	   Firstly, the Explorer's height affords a commanding `road ahead'
view.
	   Once the accident occurred, it bought sufficient time to hit the
brakes.
	   But had we not stopped in time, both front-seat occupants could
have relied on the dual-airbags in the Explorer XLT to cushion an
impact.

	   COREL Corp has incorporated its latest word processor, Corel
WordPerfect Suite 8, with Dragon System Inc's Dragon Naturally
Speaking continuous speech-recognition software.
	   The new bundle is called Corel WordPerfect Suite 8 with Dragon
Naturally Speaking (CWS8/DNS). By leveraging on the reputation of
Dragon Naturally Speaking as one of the industry's leading
voice-recognition software, Corel hopes to add value to its
existing word processing suite.
	   While both software have been available separately in the local
market for quite some time, this new bundle from Corel is still at
its beta stage.
	   ``The first final version of the CWS8/DNS will only be shipped
and made locally available in the next couple of weeks,'' said Kany
Chan, Corel's media relations manager for China and Southeast Asia,
at a Press conference recently.
	   CWS8/DNS runs on Windows 95 and NT platforms with a minimum of
133 megahertz (MHz) processor, 48 megabytes (MB) of random access
memory (RAM), 110 megabytes (MB) of hard disk space, a 16-bit sound
card and compact disk read-only-memory (CD-ROM) drive.
	   According to Chan, the CWS8/DNS allows users to dictate up to
160 words per minute and encompasses a vocabulary of 230,000 words,
customised abbreviations and jargon. But like all existing
voice-recognition software, it requires ``training'' to the
particular user's speech pattern, and is vulnerable to disruption
from the environment's background sound.
	   Although still unconfirmed, Corel said the price of this latest
bundling effort will range as the local recommended retail price
for the Corel WordPerfect Suite 8. CWS8/DNS is also expected to
come packaged with a headset microphone to facilitate usage of the
voice-recognition part of the word processor.
	   At the same event, Corel also launched the Corel Print Office,
an entry level desktop publishing application aimed at small
office-home office (SOHO) users.
	   The software encompasses three main components, which are: Corel
Print Office, Corel Photo House and Corel Colleagues  Contacts.
	   Chan also gave a brief insight on Corel's development of
Java-based products. ``There are three parts to Corel's Java
strategy and they are the OpenJ Development Environment, jSuite and
jBridge thin-client technology,''
	   she said. ``The OpenJ Development Environment is a professional
software developers kit for Java applications, while jSuite is for
end users who want to create lightweighted, Java business
applications.''
	   Chan added that the jBridge thin-client technology is Corel's
answer for users of 32-bit Windows applications who want to take
advantage of Java virtual machines.
	   As for the development of these Java-based products, she said
Corel worked with Sun Microsystems in the initial stages of the
development.
	   ``These three Java applications from Corel should be available
by the end of 1998,'' Chan said.
	   The local distributor for Corel products is SiS Distribution (M)
Sdn Bhd.

	   `FOR BETTER or for worse, till death do us part.' How many
people actually keep to this marriage vow and stick together
through thick and thin? At a time when our economy is faltering,
let us all re-examine our matrimonial commitments to each other.
This brings me to the subject of this issue's topic - the
indispensable role of women in the success (or failure) of their
husbands.
	   The economic problems have taken its toll on many marriages,
leading to divorce. Relationships have been highly strained and
many families have fallen apart, primarily because people are not
able to have the same life-style that they had in good times.
	   I have a close friend who went through bad times recently. His
business collapsed and the loan sharks were circling. Empathising
with his plight, I introduced him to a job in another town. He
brought his wife and his son along. However, things did not work
out and the couple could not get along. My friend became unbearable
to live with and his wife's impatience with his inability to
overcome their financial woes took its toll on their marriage.
	   I admire women who go through thick and thin and stand by their
men. One such case is the wife of the Thai multi-millionaire turned
sandwich vendor, Sirivat Voravetvuthikun (he appeared in our April
issue) who was here recently to give support to our TTGG (The Tough
Get Going) Fund. His wife, Vilailuck, earned a degree from
Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, majoring in cost accounting.
After getting married, she gave up her lucrative job to help her
husband run his condominium project when it was not running
smoothly.
	   When the stock market crashed, her husband was down by one
billion baht (RM100 million)! She stood by her husband when the
business collapsed and he turned sandwich salesman. In fact,
selling sandwiches was actually her idea! From the start of their
sandwich venture, she would wake up every morning at 3.00 am and
spend the next three hours preparing the sandwiches.
	   When I asked her why she was prepared to stand by him all the
way, this was what she said: `My husband is a good man. When he was
rich, he was not one to squander his money. He doesn't smoke,
doesn't drink and doesn't womanize. Many a time he wouldn't even
spend on new clothes for himself.
	   He would continue to invest whatever he earned into his business
venture.
	   He did his best for his family. I must now stand by my man when
the chips are down.' Yes, it is easy to stick around when the going
is good, but it is really during tough times that we need to stick
together more, to give support in whatever way we can.
	   Recently, I had the good fortune of meeting Datuk Maznah Hamid,
who rose from being a farmer's daughter to become Malaysia's top
Malay woman entrepreneur, managing director of the Securiforce
group of companies and director of Perbadanan Usahawan Nasional Bhd
(National Entrepreneur Corporation) which oversees 300 public
listed companies. Maznah (she has since earned the nickname the
Iron Lady of Malaysia) and her husband went through thick and thin
on their way to be what they are today. This is what she says: `I
would rather lose everything than to lose my husband and family.'
Couples during these challenging times should emulate them.
	   To all the women in our lives, I have this to say: `It is easy
enough to be pleasant, `When life flows along like in a song.' `But
the spouse worthwhile is the one who will smile, `When everything
goes dead wrong!' Let's adopt the stance that in life there is no
such thing as bad weather, only varying levels of good weather. A
supportive spouse is important to guide the men through rain or
shine. Women like Vilailuck and Maznah are shining beacons who
point the way out of the gloom.
	   This article is the second in a series contributed by Billi P S

<TEXT>
	   PENAFIEL, Portugal (AP) _ A court Monday sentenced five men to
the longest jail term allowed under Portuguese law for an arson
attack on a nightclub last year that killed 13 people and injured
22.
	   The court handed down the 25-year sentence to Jose Queiros for
contracting three bouncers from the nearby city of Oporto and
paying them 1 million escudos (dlrs 5,800) each to carry out the
attack.
	   The three-month trial heard how the three armed and hooded
bouncers doused the Meia Culpa nightclub in gasoline and set it
alight at 4 a.m. on April 16 last year.
	   The men, in their early 20s, stopped the people inside from
fleeing the fire, and shot one man in the back as he ran for a
door.
	   The bouncers, and the intermediary between them and Queiros,
also received the maximum jail term.
	   The motive was believed to be the competition for business in
Amarante, 300 miles (480 kilometers) north of Lisbon where the
recently opened Meia Culpa was rivaling Queiros's club called the
Diamante Negro.
	   Two men who stole the car used in the getaway were each jailed
for one year.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; thousands flee

Eds: UPDATES with thousands marching in Kosovo. RECASTS, trims

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Refugees from Serbia's Kosovo
province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to escape some
of the worst fighting in months. Dozens of people were reported
killed.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources often were contradictory
and could not be independently verified. But with 39 people
reported killed over the weekend, and fighting apparently
continuing, the bloodshed seemed the worst since early March, when
Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a crackdown on
independence-minded militants and their families.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Troboja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said. They said more were arriving
by the hour.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom walked for as many
as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a school.
Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Community to intervene ``for ending the
massacre in Kosovo.''
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragical dimensions,'' it
said.
	   Authorities in Serbia, which with Montenegro comprises all that
remains of the Yugoslav federation, are trying to block Kosovo's
independence bid. They are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March. An estimated 50 percent of the Serbian province
is controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked
off, either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce
battles were reported Sunday. In Pristina, about 10,000 ethnic
Albanians, including 2,000 children, marched to protest Serbian
rule.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday accused ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' of killing several of their
countrymen while shelling several villages near the border with
Albania whose residents do not support the militants.

Portuguese, Venezuelan consortium takes over private channel 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A consortium of Portuguese and
Venezuelan companies Monday won their battle for control of private
national television channel Televisao Independente, one of the
country's four broadcasters.
	   A court approved the takeover after TVI's creditors endorsed the
consortium's proposed recovery plan for the debt-ridden channel.
	   The consortium includes retail and industrial giant Sonae, media
and entertainment group Lusomundo, both from Portugal, and
Venezuela's Cisneros Group.
	   The Cisneros Group, one of the largest corporations in Latin
America, owns businesses in communications, entertainment and soft
drinks, including Venevision, Venezuela's No. 1 TV station.
	   The consortium's plan beat two other bids for control of TVI
which was launched in 1993 by institutions and companies linked to
the Roman Catholic Church as the country's second private channel.
	   TVI has failed to secure an average weekly audience share of
more than 15 percent since its launch, and creditors reportedly are
owed 17 billion escudos (dlrs 93 million).
	   SIC, the first private channel, launched in 1992, has attained
an audience share of about 50 percent, eclipsing state broadcaster
Radiotelevisao Portuguesa, created in 1956.
	   The latest viewing figures, for the week May 18-24, gave SIC a
49.6 percent share, with 32.6 percent for RTP1, 11.3 percent for
TVI, and 6.5 percent for RTP2.

	   PENANG, Sun. - About 11,000 people surged across the longest
bridge in Asia in the International Penang Bridge Run today, the
largest group of people ever to gather on the bridge at any one
time.
	   The run, which has been gaining popularity over the years, saw
the introduction of a 42.195km full marathon, which attracted 800
runners.
	   Most of the major titles were won by the 1,000-odd foreigners
who took six of the nine top placings in the adult categories.
	   The runners who salvaged Malaysia's pride were S. Devamani, who
won the marathon women's open - beating international marathon
favourite Sunitha Godara of India into second place; R. Muniandy
who retained his half- marathon men's open title, and Chua Say
Choon who retained his half-marathon junior veteran title.
	   Thailand, with 350 runners, did very well with Jirattigarn
Boonma and Kesinee Unsa-ard winning the inaugural marathon men's
open and marathon women's veteran events.
	   Watanabe Yuji of Japan won the marathon men's veteran event
while Lee Kar Lun of Hong Kong took the half-marathon junior
veteran title.
	   Preethida Somajit of Thailand clinched the half-marathon women's
veteran event.
	   The Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh Tahir presented the
prizes to the top five winners of the marathon men's open.
	   The run was organised by the New Straits Times and Lembaga
Lebuhraya Malaysia with the co-operation of the State Government,
the State Youth and Sports Department, the Penang Amateur Athletic
Association and the Penang Bridge Sdn Bhd.
	   Works Ministry Parliamentary Secretary Yong Khoon Seng flagged
off the runners in stages from atop a Simon snorkel. With him were
New Straits Times Sdn Bhd group editor Datuk A. Kadir Jasin, LLM
chairman Datuk Yahya Yaacob and Penang Amateur Athletic Association
secretary Paul Subramaniam.
	   All the VIPs, including Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon,
also took part in a Celebrity Run held in conjunction with the run
to raise funds for charity.
	   Low Yong Leong of Penang won a return air ticket to Seattle, US,
donated by EVA Air, in the quiz held after the run.

	   AFTER more than a century of churning out nothing but designer
luggage and other leather accessories, Louis Vuitton is breaking
new ground.
	   This year, the label marked its entry into the world of fashion
with the release of its ready-to-wear line and shoes for men and
women, culminating with the opening of four new stores around the
world to house the new range.
	   Despite being a virgin venture, the collection was a hit, thanks
to designer Marc Jacobs. (Incidently, LV is very proud of its new
designer's work. Says David Au, marketing and communications
director for Louis Vuitton Asia Pacific, of Jacobs: ``We love him.
He is great and fantastic and wonderful.'') More au courant, LV
came up with a range of pens, which it hopes to launch here in
July.
	   And finally, in celebration of the last World Cup of the
century, hosted by France this month, the label has come up with
limited edition luxury designer soccer balls.
	   The ball, although made of canvas and patterned with the classic
Louis Vuitton monogram, has all of the weight, bounce and size of a
normal soccer ball. Costing 2,800 French francs (about RM1,600) and
stamped with the official logo of the World Cup, it is supposed to
make a great present for the avid soccer fan.
	   It is a costly designer ball, and one would find it hard to
imagine anyone kicking this collector's item around, but Au insists
that ``... this is a real working soccer ball. You have to play
with it. I don't think we designed this to sit on a shelf and
deflate after a while.''
	   Only 3,000 balls are being issued, with 250 allocated to Asia.
	   So far, promotions have only been done in Hong Kong and
Malaysia.
	   According to Au, the response in Hong Kong has been fantastic,
with over 50 reservations made so far.
	   To obtain one of these collectibles, one has make a reservation
at any Louis Vuitton store. The balls are available now, provided
LV doesn't have any problems bringing them into the country.
	   (Au had a tough time explaining the monogram canvas football
when he checked it through our Customs.) Asked why Louis Vuitton
was venturing into new areas, Au appeared evasive.
	   Instead, he said: ``We want to create a whole new luxury
collection for Vuitton. But the spirit of travel will always be
there because we want to be close to our roots.''

	   ONE of the problems that top Singapore makeup artists Dily Wang
and Andy Lee used to face in their work was the difficulty in
finding the right shade of foundation for their predominantly Asian
clients.
	   ``Although there are a few brands catering to Asian skin, many
of the popular brands have pink tones that are more suitable for
Caucasian skin.
	   Even Japanese brands are meant for fair skin.
	   ``It has always therefore been our dream to come up with our own
brand that would suit Asian skin,'' says Lee, whose work has been
featured on the cover of virtually every Singapore and some foreign
fashion magazines. He is highly sought-after by Television
Corporation Singapore actresses as well as by visiting celebrities.
	   Lee and his former beauty coursemate Wang realised their
ambition of developing their own line of makeup and skincare 1
years ago. They teamed up with another friend and started ``i nuovi
cosmetics''. Pronounced as ``ee nu-vi'', the words mean ``the new''
in Italian.
	   ``We have four outlets in Singapore and one in Malaysia, at
Isetan KLCC (Kuala Lumpur City Centre). Our products are also
available worldwide via the Internet.''
	   Conceptualised by Lee and Wang, a beauty salon owner, i nuovi
cosmetics represents the latest in makeup innovation and
technology. The products are manufactured in advanced laboratories
in France, Italy and America, claimed Lee who was in KL recently to
train the company's sales staff.
	   Consumers have a wide range of colours to select from; there are
60 shades of lipstick colour alone. To match Asian skin, most of
the foundations have a yellow base rather than a pink base, though
the latter is also available.
	   Besides the usual range of makeup and skincare items, i nuovi
cosmetics also has trendy party makeup that is tinted with luminous
hues.
	   ``The teenagers love this new-age type of makeup,'' raves Lee,
who writes a fortnightly beauty column for a leading Chinese
magazine, Sister Pictorial. he also hosts the makeup segment of a
weekly TV programme.
	   Using simple but elegant packaging, the products are priced from
RM28 for a lipliner pencil to RM96.50 for a bottle of foundation.
	   Besides building their brandname, Lee and Wang are also in the
midst of setting up a makeup school in the island republic.
	   ``We plan to provide a comprehensive course that covers various
types of makeup including normal, bridal and stage makeup. We also
hope to publish books on the art of applying makeup,'' says Lee.

Police allow men, women to pray together at Jerusalem's Western Wall 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Breaking precedent, 300 men and women prayed
together at Jerusalem's Western Wall _ despite violent protests by
ultra-Orthodox Jews, who threw garbage at the worshippers over a
police barrier.
	   Sunday marked the first time that police allowed men and women
to pray together at the wall, Judaism's holiest site.
	   In the past, police upheld ultra-Orthodox practices, making sure
men and women prayed in segregated areas. It was not immediately
clear whether Sunday's action marked a lasting change in police
policy.
	   Worshippers from the more liberal Reform and Conservative
streams of Judaism _ dominant among U.S. Jews _ made up the mixed
service.
	   In Israel, the Orthodox establishment has a monopoly over
religious matters, including marriage and divorce.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; thousands flee employees seeing fighting; CORRECTS name of border village to Tropoja

Eds: UPDATES with U.N. spokesman confirming refugee exodus, U.N.
By ISMET HAJDARI

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Refugees from Serbia's Kosovo
province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to escape some
of the worst violence in months. Dozens of people were reported
killed and some trapped by the fighting.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources often were contradictory
and could not be independently verified. But with 39 people
reported killed over the weekend, and fighting apparently
continuing, the bloodshed seemed the worst since early March, when
Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a crackdown on
independence-minded militants and their families.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of some Kosovo Albanian villages near the
border to Albania. He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars
being fired into the villages.
	   A day after Serb authorities claimed to have killed several
dozen militants in four villages in the Decani region of western
Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed
over the weekend.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians, mostly women, children and elderly, to leave the
troubled region and cross over into Albania's Tropoja region Sunday
and Monday, Albanian authorities said. They said more were arriving
by the hour.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in the Albanian
capital, Tirana, that the refugees, many of whom had walked for as
many as 10 hours, were being accommodated in local homes and a
school. Local authorities were providing free food and clothes.
	   Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, called the refugee flow ``the
largest such exodus to date.''
	   He said that 1,300 people fled to Tropoja town on Sunday alone
and cited reports that some people were ``trapped and cannot cross
the border.''
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Union to intervene to end ``the massacre in
Kosovo.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The central computer on board Mir was working
again Monday night, after a three-day breakdown that threatened to
postpone the Russian space station's last rendezvous with a U.S.
shuttle.
	   The Mir crew now hopes to reactivate the station's automatic
steering system, said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian
Mission Control. The shuttle can only dock with Mir when the
steering system keeps it properly aligned.
	   The space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday and
dock with the station Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew Thomas,
the seventh and last American to live on the Russian outpost.
	   Lyndin said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   Ground controllers fully loaded the software into the computer
Monday night, and the crew was able to get it working again within
about 90 minutes. Reactivating the steering system can take an
entire day.
	   During a chat with ground controllers during the repair process,
Musabayev said the situation on board ``isn't bad'' but added that
he was concerned that it occurred on the eve of the shuttle's
launch. ``I'm worried not for myself, but for the flight program,''
he said.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a shuttle ferry flight
in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months of
trouble-free operation. The station's crew has replaced it with a
back-up computer brought up by a Russian cargo ship.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply is
threatened because it can't keep its solar panels in optimum
alignment with the sun.
	   Depending on how much energy was lost, it can take from one to
three days to get the orientation system fully on-line.
	   Fortunately, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was
on the so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight
round the clock. As a result, the Mir's solar panels have remained
in full sunlight.
	   The crew also shut down some systems to save energy, and as a
result Mir's batteries were full on Monday, making it easier for
the crew to restore the orientation system, Lyndin said.
	   Russia plans to bring down the 12-year-old Mir at the end of
1999 after the first parts of the international space station are
in orbit.
	   A Russian-manufactured propulsion system, is supposed to be
launched in November. But Russia's contributions to the station
have been delayed repeatedly because of financial problems.
	   A service module for the station to be supplied by Russia is
nearly ready for testing, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   A satellite communications system and a computer will be
installed in the module before it is sent to the Baikonur launch
site in Kazakstan, where it will be launched in April of next year,
the report said.

<TEXT>
	   TOUGH times are upon us. Industry sales are sluggish. Equity
markets are down. The economic growth is grinding to a halt.
Corporate performance is declining.
	   What type of leadership is required to overcome these tough
times? We often hear corporate leaders complain that things are out
of their control. They cite the economic slowdown, which is an
external factor, as an example.
	   They say that they are no longer in charge and that they are
driven by external circumstances. Companies cannot afford to retain
such leaders who only know how to manage good times but are
helpless during tough times.
	   An extraordinary leadership is required to turn around this
predicament.
	   We need leadership that can help us transcend the difficulties
and take us to the desired destination. I call this transcendental
leadership.
	   Extraordinary challenges require extraordinary leaders who can
transcend what it is to what it can be. Scientist Albert Einstein
said: ``No problem can be solved from the same consciousness that
created it. We must learn to see the world anew.''
	   To transcend, we need to go beyond the limits of consciousness.
To do this, we need transcendental leadership.
	   Transcendental leadership is different from normal leadership.
Normal leadership is based on defined human limits. The Advanced
Oxford Dictionary defines ``transcend'' as going beyond normal
limits.
	   Transcendental leadership is about going beyond the defined
limits of human knowledge, experience or reason to turn adversity
into advantage.
	   The key word here is ``defined''. Humans are often limited by
the way or the degree they define things. Ordinary humans think,
feel and act base on a mindset they are accustomed to. Defining
existing problems and coming up with solutions within this paradigm
won't overcome unusual crises.
	   Transcendental leaders are those who can break limits by helping
others redefine their possibilities. In this cyber age, we are
beset by challenges that often go beyond the defined capabilities
of normal leaders.
	   Transcendental leaders use new levels of thinking, feeling and
actions to overcome new challenges. Transcendental leaders know
that the power to change comes from within them. They know they
have access to limitless capacity, creativity and inner resources
to change.
	   The economic slowdown is an example of the emergence of unusual
challenges that require transcendental leadership. Transcendental
leaders enable people in an organisation to think what has not been
thought before, to feel what has not been felt before and to act on
what has not been done before, to achieve new desired levels of
performance which have never been achieved before.
	   To overcome the slowdown, organisations need transcendental
leaders who can undertake 10 key transcendental roles to help their
organisation bridge the chasm they are in today to where they want
to be tomorrow.
	   The accompanying diagram shows the 10 key transcendental roles.
	   Thinking the unthinkable New inventions, discoveries and
breakthroughs are achieved through thinking beyond normal
conventions. If leadership was to be based on thinking the common,
people today will not able to fly. For many centuries, men had
dreamt of flying, but conventional thinking had always weighed men
down. Conventional thinking had become the barrier to men's
capability to fly, making them believe that the ``flying carpets''
of the Arabian Nights were only dreams and could never be a
reality.
	   It took unconventional thinking on the part of the Wright
brothers to break free of those limitations. Isaac Newton, who is
considered one of the greatest scientists of all time, was able to
think beyond convention and thus discovered the laws of gravity.
The story of young Newton sitting by an apple tree and asking, ``
Why did the apple fall downward and not upward?'' is a good example
of thinking the unthinkable.
	   Mahatma Gandhi was in the realm of unthinkable during his time
when he influenced his countrymen regarding his philosophy of
non-violence and his commitment towards achieving independence for
India. Martin Luther King was thinking the unthinkable for blacks
in America in the '60s when he said: ``I have a dream that one day
on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons
of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the
table of brotherhood.
	   ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day live
in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their
skin but the the content of their character.''
	   Political and industrial leaders must be brave enough to explore
the realms of the unthinkable to turn around the Asian economies
and corporate performance.
	   They need a new way of thinking to come up with new solutions.
There must be many ways a region, a nation, a community and an
organisation can turn around the economies, besides just focusing
on cost-cutting.
	   We must begin by developing leadership that encourages thinking
the unthinkable.
	   Feeling the numbness Numbness is best understood when one is
showered with so many gifts that one additional gift will not give
more pleasure. Thus, the overabundance of gifts will reduce one's
appreciation for them. Likewise, when one is injured in an
accident, one more injury will not add additional pain.
	   In good times leaders often become immune to their success. They
forget that it is customers who pay their salaries and luxuries. It
is the hard work of their people who laid the foundation of
success, and that the continued success of their organisations will
depend on their continuous improvement of their services and their
organisation as a whole.
	   The moment leaders become numb to their staff, customers,
suppliers, competitors, government and stakeholders, it is the
beginning of their downfall. Complacency is often the culprit that
numbs the feelings of leaders towards changes around them.
	   For example, many leaders in Asian corporate organisations are
not confident as they are numbed by the message of gloom. Some have
become complacent with the message of despair and are willing to
accept their fate.
	   In good times they are numbed by pleasure while in bad times
they are numbed by their pain. In short, they become immune to the
present conditions and do little to change conditions for the
better.
	   Transcendental leadership is about the ability to feel despite
the numbness that is setting in all around us. They possess the
power of aliveness and the ability to feel fully without being
numbed by pleasures or pain. Transcendental leaders can change
before things become a crisis, and they can capitalise on
opportunities before they become opportunity costs.
	   Doing the impossible At a recent business convention, I met John
Coutis, a powerful and successful motivation speaker with
extraordinary perseverance.
	   Coutis is physically handicapped as he has no legs. He moves
around with his hands . He speaks more eloquently and with more
conviction than any other motivational speakers.
	   The truth is that Coutis can do what most conscious minds think
impossible. He is doing more things than an ordinary person. He
scuba dives, swims, plays base ball, lifts weights, drives, speaks
at conventions and does his own laundry.
	   Coutis is a great motivational leader, providing inspiration to
young people and business leaders around the world. Coutis' most
valuable message is that he has an advantage, that he can see his
handicap, whereas most people cannot see their ``handicaps''. He
added that most people have a ``handicap'' in the way they think
what is possible and what is impossible.
	   Coutis' philosophy can be summarised as: ``There's no such word
as can't.''
	   What resources Coutis lacks externally, he has been able to draw
them from within him.
	   His extraordinary belief, determination and positive disposition
provides him enormous power to overcome challenges in his life.
	   Great people have been able to achieve extraordinary feats
because they dare to try what seems impossible.
	   Roger Bannister was the first to break the four-minute mile
barrier.
	   Christopher Columbus did the seemingly impossible by setting
sail on a route to East Asia by sailing due west across the
Atlantic Ocean.
	   His tenacity to find a westward route from Europe to the Orient
led to his discovery of the Americas and created history.
	   A 19th-century editor and essayist, Elbert Hubbard, said: ``The
world is moving so fast these days that anyone who says it can't be
done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.''
	   Political and corporate leaders will learn well if they heed
this message.
	   Touching the untouchables The original concept of
``untouchables'' came from Hinduism's hierarchical and hereditary
caste system. The lowest group in this system was called
``untouchables''.
	   However, the concept of untouchable that we would like to
discuss here is different.
	   The best way to illustrate this is that when watching a tragic
love movie, we often notice that there are people who are
emotionally overwhelmed and shed a bucket of tears. These people
are touched by the drama as depicted in the movies.
	   On the other, hand there are also people who are untouched by
any of these tragic dramas, either outwardly or emotionally. One of
the important roles of leaders is to touch these ``untouchables''
who are distant and impartial to what is going on.
	   In organisations, we listen to managers who complain that there
are staff who cannot be motivated no matter what they do to them.
These managers say that these staff are a lost cause.
	   While there is such a reality as an ``unmotivated person'',
there is no such reality as an ``unmotivatable person''.
	   Within each one of us lies huge motivation potential which is
waiting to be unleashed.
	   The unmotivated person is untouchable and is not moved by the
normal calling of their work. The role of transcendental leaders is
to change the unmotivated to become motivated.
	   To do this, they need to liberate the motivation power within
individuals and help them achieve great feats for themselves, for
their families, for their organisations, for their nations and for
the world.
	   Transcendental leaders can touch the minds, hearts and souls of
individuals to the extent that people are willing to commit their
all to a worthy cause.
	   These transcendental leaders know how to put the message in such
a compelling and attractive manner that people are so touched by
their noble cause and want to be a part of it.
	   Victor S.L. Tan is the chief executive officer of KL Strategic
Change Consulting Group. He holds a MBA degree from Ohio State
University.
	   His latest book is ``Changing Mindsets: Ensuring The Future Of
Asian Organisations''. He will conduct a two-day workshop on
``Managing Tough Times'' on June 17 and 18.

Report: Pakistan feared Israeli attack hours before nuclear detonations 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Pakistan feared an Israeli air strike on its
nuclear installations hours before it detonated five nuclear
devices last week, Israeli media reported Monday.
	   State-run Israel television said Pakistan's foreign minister
informed the United States about the plans last Thursday, hours
before it carried out the tests. Pakistan believed that Israeli
planes would operate out of bases in India, the report said.
	   The United States told Pakistan that Israel was not planning any
such attack, Israel's Channel Two Television said.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied an attack was planned. ``These reports are totally
baseless,'' he told Israel TV.
	   Israel, an undeclared nuclear power, has warned that India and
Pakistan's atomic tests could encourage Iran to follow suit.
	   Israel destroyed an Iraqi nuclear facility in 1981.
	   The Israeli Cabinet discussed the recent tests on the
sub-continent on Monday, and Netanyahu's media adviser David
Bar-Illan said in a statement that Monday's visit by Iran's foreign
minister to Pakistan ``strengthens Israel and the international
community's calls to make every effort in order to prevent Iran
from gaining a nuclear capacity.''
	   ``The international community needs to act decisively in order
to prevent Iranian capabilities,'' he said.
	   According to Israeli officials, Iran is seeking technology to
build a bomb and is close to having its own long-range delivery
system capable of hitting Israel.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistan, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said Monday that Muslims everywhere welcomed the nuclear tests, but
dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow Pakistan
down the nuclear road.

Eds: UPDATES with U.N. spokesman confirming refugee exodus, U.N.
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees from Serbia's
Kosovo province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to
escape some of the deadliest fighting in months. Dozens of people
were reported killed.
	   Albania appealed to the United States and European Union to
intervene in what it said was a ``massacre'' in Kosovo.
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragic dimensions,'' the
Albanian government said in a statement.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources often were contradictory
and could not be independently verified. But with 39 people
reported killed over the weekend, and fighting apparently
continuing, the bloodshed appeared the worst since March, when
Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a crackdown on
militants among the ethnic Albanian majority in Serb-ruled Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of some Kosovo Albanian villages near the
border to Albania. He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars
being fired into the villages.
	   Serb authorities claimed Sunday to have killed dozens of
militants in four villages in the Decani region of western Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanian leaders put a firmer number on the toll among their
people, saying 37 had died.
	   Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were killed when
Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Serb
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The latest fierce fighting forced about 2,000 Kosovo Albanians _
mostly women, children and the elderly _ across the border into
Albania's Tropoja region on Sunday and Monday, Albania said. They
said more were arriving by the hour.
	   Local authorities were putting the refugees up in a school and
in private homes and giving them food and clothes, Interior
Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said in Albania's capital, Tirana.
	   Authorities in Serbia are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The conflict has killed more than 200 people in Kosovo since the
beginning of March. About half of the province is believed
controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked off,
either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the ethnic Albanians' account, Serb police burst
into Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to, ``Go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and Decani, Klina and Djakovica, where fierce battles were reported
Sunday.
	   In Pristina, about 10,000 ethnic Albanians, including 2,000
children, marched to protest Serbian rule.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run daily Politika on Monday accused ethnic
Albanian ``terrorist groups'' of killing several of their
countrymen and of shelling border villages that are home to people
opposed to the militants.
	   Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in the
Yugoslav federation.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad reiterated his call to Malaysians to remain united and face
the country's economic problems in a rational and sensitive manner.
	   Dr Mahathir said these two qualities could help avoid possible
misunderstanding and ill-feeling which were counter-productive to
ongoing efforts to overcome the country's problems.
	   He said various steps had already been taken by the Government
to restore the economy and one of them was the ``Love Malaysia'',
``Buy Malaysia'' campaign such as the one organised by the MCA.
	   Dr Mahathir said this at a large gathering of Malaysians at
Dataran Merdeka tonight, including Bond girl Michelle Yeoh and
other artistes.
	   Also present were the Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Dr Siti
Hasmah Mohd Ali, MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik and his
wife Datin Seri Ena Ling, deputy president Datuk Lim Ah Lek, MCA
central committee members, the party's Wanita chief Datuk Teng Gaik
Kwan and its Youth chief Datuk Chan Kong Choy.
	   Dr Mahathir said: ``In some other multi-racial, multi-religious
and multi-cultural countries, riots can be triggered by many
factors. But we are fortunate because we are more rational and
sensitive to each other's feelings and needs.
	   ``This is one of our strengths. Of course, there are certain
foreign Press which never fail to mention that there are racial
undercurrents in the country.
	   ``But tonight's gathering is a good example of how the various
races in Malaysia get together to play their part in helping the
economy. Some of the foreign reports seem to have been made by
people who have closed their eyes, ears and minds.
	   ``We can gather today without fear and tension. We must value
this. I am very happy that tonight's event once again demonstrates
the people's sensitive nature.''
	   He cited as an example of Malaysians' sensitivity the gesture by
the organisers to stop the performance for a while to observe the
isyak prayers at about 8.30pm.
	   Dr Mahathir said the country was still committed to achieving
developed nation status by 2020.
	   ``We believe that we are able to develop the country to be on
equal standing with other developed nations,'' he said.
	   He added others might want to see the country impoverished so
that they could then acquire the nation's assets. Hence, the attack
on share prices in the belief that they could then buy these
companies cheap.
	   He said these people also wanted to take over local banks and
industries. ``If we allow this, then we will be their slaves and
cannot claim to be independent,'' he said.

Hezbollah threatens attacks, Israeli warns of harsh response 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas have threatened
retaliation for an Israeli missile strike that hit civilians in
south Lebanon, while Israel warned of a tough response if shells
fall in Israeli territory.
	   The threats raised fears in Lebanon of a new round of
cross-border fighting in which far more Lebanese die than Israelis.
In Israel, newspapers reported Monday that residents of northern
Israel spent the night in shelters in fear of a possible Hezbollah
attack.
	   ``The resistance ... cannot keep quiet in light of what has
happened,'' Sheik Nabil Kaouk, Hezbollah commander in the south,
told reporters Sunday night after weekend Israeli rocket attacks
killed a Lebanese shepherd and wounded his brother and another man.
	   In Israel, radio reports quoted the Israeli army's northern
command as warning it will respond ``harshly'' if rockets fall on
northern Israel.
	   The Israeli army also suggested Monday that the harm to
civilians was unintentional.
	   ``Israel has no interest in attacking citizens,'' an army
statement said, adding the targeted area ``is an open space and
anyone in it is suspected of being a terrorist or protecting
terrorists.''
	   Cross-border guerrilla rocket attacks triggered major fighting
in 1996 in which at least 175 people, mostly Lebanese civilians,
were killed.
	   Since then, Hezbollah has targeted the occupied zone and
occasionally Israeli positions along the international border for
retaliation.
	   On Sunday, Israeli troops fired a missile near a village in
southern Lebanon, killing a Lebanese shepherd and wounding his
brother, security officials said. On Saturday night, an Israeli
rocket attack injured a guerrilla near another village.
	   The Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, originally said two brothers were killed in the rocket
attack Sunday. But they later said one of the brothers had only
been wounded and was hospitalized.
	   Both targets hit by Israel are in a guerrilla mountain
stronghold on the edge of the Israeli-occupied border zone in the
south.
	   Hezbollah is leading the fight to oust some 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 Lebanese militia allies from the occupied zone. Israel or
its allies have controlled the zone for over 20 years, maintaining
the occupation is needed to guard against cross-border guerrilla
raids.

	   WILL owners of Federal capital shophouses which have seen better
days as historical buildings, still lie low and wait for the last
minute to spruce up and paint the buildings? Their lackadaisical
attitude may mar the image of the city and its surroundings.
	   They should not wait for City Hall to slap them with summonses
before getting down to action.
	   Sukom or Commonwealth Games '98 is just around the corner.
	   The main thoroughfare leading to the prestigious Subang Stadium
is still very much in need of various facelifts, including
landscaping, which still looks miserably bare.
	   Five months from now may be a little short a time for City Hall
to have things adequately spruced up. Let us hope that with the
help of modern machinery, they will be able tackle the problem much
better.
	   It is earnestly hoped that in the coming weeks, our citizens
will be civic-minded enough to refrain from littering.
	   To create a mood of pomp and pageantry, in view of the coming
Sukom '98, it is suggested that City Hall, with the help of the
private sectors, erect colourful arches, hang banners, standards,
buntings and flags of the various local States and also illuminate
shops and houses with glittering lights.
	   It is also hoped that Tenaga Nasional will charge lower tariffs
to enable more folk to join in.

	   I HAVE decided - for better or worse - to stay true to my Fiat.
	   True, my trusty Fiat has overheated in the midst of the traffic
crawl along Jalan Tun Razak in the middle of the day, with
everybody gawking and no one stopping to help.
	   It's true to say that my sentimental junk has a worse medical
condition than me and has to meet its doctor (mechanic) more often
than I have to see mine. And every time I bring it in for minor
repairs, I might just have to forego the new clothes that I
intended to buy that month.
	   My 18-year-old junk is inclined to break down in the middle of
the night along a road where there are no public phones and no
passing vehicles for hours. And I dare not drive it into the Lake
Club and park it outside for fear that I might be accused of
depriving others with their Mercedes and BMWs of a parking spot.
	   True that even if I started carpooling, others might still
insist on taking the bus or even prefer to walk.
	   And whenever I am driving my trusty Mirafiori 131 on the left
lane, I get honked at for no reason whatsoever.
	   My nephew Siji has never tired of reminding me that the car
should be thrown into some disused mining pool but then I do not
have to burn a hole in my pocket every month when the car loan
sharks come to collect their monthly dues.
	   In this economic hardship era, when the interest rates of all
the car loans have gone up, I can smile and console myself that I
would not be affected at all as my car belongs to me a hundred per
cent.
	   While others have to be careful with their spending, I would
still be able to afford to gorge on cheesecakes and chocolates and
give others a treat once in a while.
	   Besides, my car would be the only one of its kind running on the
road in a major traffic jam and might even be sought after in 20
years to come.
	   And when cars are crawling along Jalan Tun Razak in the middle
of the scorching afternoon and a brand new car decides to stall
(which I have seen numerous times), I can hold my head up high (and
if I could, I would even raise the two front wheels like they do
with BMX bicycles!) and drive past in style. And all sensible
drivers will say - see that trusty Fiat go! If I ever knock into or
get knocked into by a brand new car, my first worry would not be
``What happened to my car?'' but the question would be more of
``How bad is his or her car?''
	   And when I go to any of the mechanics in town, they would fix
the dent or restart it for me at the most minimal price or even for
free, for fear that I might not be able to afford the bill.
	   Now whenever the car decides to stall, I would curse it and
threaten to throw it into the disused mining pool in Puchong but
the silver lining here is that when it is repaired and on the road
again, I will be a stronger person having gone through that phase.
	   And if I ever decide to stop to buy those things that they sell
at the roadside stalls along the highways, the sellers would not
even think of charging me more than the usual price. They might
even reduce it if I asked them.
	   I know that my ``fiatty'' Fiat is at present out of fashion but
then again, the fact remains that a child developing a hand at art
would definitely start off by drawing MY car, and not some sporty
sedan.
	   And when senior journalists talk about the old times when they
were driving only Peugeots and Fiats, I can join in and say ``Look,
I am going down the same road as you people''. There will also come
a day when I can talk of ``Those days when .....'' to the younger
breed.
	   While for many people Fiat stands for ``Fiat Is Always
Trouble'', to me, MY Fiat stands for ``Fiat Is Always True''.

	   LAST April 3, I was out walking with a friend who was back from
the United States on vacation.
	   We were walking from Jalan Chulan towards Jalan Sultan Ismail,
and on the left of the pedestrian walkway along Jalan P. Ramlee.
	   Upon crossing the road, we came across a signboard which we
believed might have been a bit too low for the safety of
pedestrians.
	   My friend suffered a cut on his left temple because he was
unaware of the signboard. The sharp edge of the signboard caused a
gash which started to bleed.
	   I imagine the walkway had been resurfaced, leading to it being
higher off the ground. The height of the signboard, however, was
not reset.
	   I recommend that the authorities re-install the signboard or
remove it before someone else gets injured.

	   HYPERTEC Memory (M) Sdn Bhd, which specialises in personal
computer (PC) memory, has announced the availability of the
HyperRace MxPro 180, a processor upgrade designed to enhance
central processing unit (CPU) performance by up to 360 per cent.
	   According to the company, the HyperRace MxPro 180 is able to
enhance CPU performance up to 360 per cent and is one of the most
cost-effective MMX upgrade products, allowing users to run
MMX-enabled software.
	   Hypertec Memory said the product could be easily installed and
it provides a simple alternative to buying a new Pentium MMX
computer.
	   ``The HyperRace MxPro 180 will bring an organisation or an
individual's existing system up to today's expected performance
standard for a fraction of the cost of a new Pentium PC,'' said
Hypertec Malaysia's managing director Colin Lillywhite at the
product launch held in conjunction with the opening of the local
office.
	   ``The local offices provide benefits for customers in this
region by giving them reliable and fast delivery of our large,
quality product range, including HyperRace processor upgrades and
HyperRam memory products,'' he said.
	   The company said the HyperRace MxPro 180 is suitable for users
of Windows 95, Windows NT, games software and Internet
applications. It is capable of increasing the software performance
on a 75-megahertz (MHz) Pentium processor by 47 per cent for
Windows 95, 41 per cent for Windows NT and by 368 per cent for
multimedia and games programs.
	   The HyperRace MxPro 180's socket-5 and socket-7 and basic input
output system (BIOS) enhancement software ensures compatibility
with existing systems. The product, said Hypertec Memory, meets the
standards of XXCAL Inc, an American independent testing body that
provides quality assurance and compatibility testing, and the
Australian Electromagnetic Interference Standard (C-Tick).
	   It also allows users to take full advantage of the increased
internal CPU speed of 180MHz by including a large 64K internal
write-back cache memory. The size of this cache memory reduces the
number of external accesses which the CPU has to make. Hypertec
Memory claimed this is significant as Pentium-class CPUs slow down
between 50 and 66MHz when accessing the rest of the system.
	   The HyperRace MxPro 180 is available at a retail price of RM599.

	   OUTSIDERS need only to take a 15-minute drive inside Subang
Jaya-USJ any day of the week to experience the notorious traffic
jams and chaotic driving habits of drivers in this township.
	   Drivers who are new to this township will certainly be shocked
and stunned upon coming across motorists who appear suddenly and
drive head-on from the opposite direction of a one-way street.
	   Yes! ``No Entry'' signs don't mean a thing to certain drivers in
Subang Jaya-USJ.
	   It's a ``free-for-all'' for all they care.
	   Knowing motorists will always anticipate and be extra careful
upon entering a one-way street, to avoid hitting someone who might
be coming at them from the opposite direction.
	   Drivers of school buses and parents fetching their children home
from schools in SS19, Subang Jaya seldom observe the few ``No
Entry'' signs in the area, especially those along roads between the
shophouses.
	   Often, there are bound to be some drivers coming from the USJ
direction, defying the traffic lights and rules at the popular SS19
Subang Jaya traffic light junction, and making U-turns into SS18.
	   This short cut is dangerous and can easily lead to a nasty
accident.
	   Although, there are two ``No Entry'' signs prominently placed on
both sides of the entrance of a narrow and short sliproad from
Jalan USL 3/1E, which directly links up with the nearby SS19 bridge
into Subang Jaya, you can still see cars coming out from that
sliproad.
	   Again this is a short cut to get on the bridge and into Subang
Jaya from USJ.
	   It's also horrifying to see motorists making U-turns at the KFC
exit.
	   There is an urgent need for strict enforcement of the traffic
laws by the relevant authorities. They should keep an eye on those
who flout the traffic rules in SS19 so that the roads can be made
safe for all motorists.

Israel decides against selling off most of El Al 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel decided Monday to keep ownership of 51
percent of the national air carrier El Al, despite recommendations
the unprofitable company be sold off, according to a government
statement.
	   A government panel had recommended that the airline be sold off
by this year. El Al lost dlrs 83 million in 1996 and dlrs 35
million in 1997.
	   The decision ensures that El Al flights will continue to be
grounded during the Jewish Sabbath _ from Friday sundown to
Saturday sundown. The Sabbath groundings have been cited as a
factor in the company's losses.
	   No date for selling off 49 percent of the company has been set
yet.
	   A statement from the ministerial committee overseeing Israel's
privatization plans quoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as
calling Monday's decision ``important.''
	   ``It will protect out national interests,'' he said
	   Israel radio said national security and emergency situations
were key factors in the decision to retain a majority of the
airline.
	   El Al is known for its strict security checks and Israel has
used the airliner in the past for secret operations such as a 1985
airlift of thousands of Ethiopian Jews from Addis Ababa to Israel.

	   THE Selayang Municipal Council's prompt action in tearing down
an illegal canteen in Rawang earlier this month, where a confirmed
case of cholera was reported, has prevented the disease from
spreading.
	   Council medical officer Dr Tuan Ramlah Tuan Muda said the victim
was an Indonesian worker who had eaten cendol from a stall in
Petaling Jaya.
	   ``We believe this was the source of the infection. The vendor's
wife, however, was only a carrier but did not have any cholera
symptoms,'' she said.
	   The third reported case this month involved a worker from
Selayang Bahagia whose source of infection has not yet been
identified.
	   Dr Tuan Ramlah said as a precautionary measure all cendol stalls
in the municipality would be closed with immediate effect until the
situation improves.
	   ``We are inspecting every `cendol' stall in the municipality and
are in the process of taking samples for tests,'' she said.
	   She said the council was working closely with the Gombak
District Health Office in carrying out inspections.
	   She said the message from the council was that any food operator
carrying out business under unhygienic conditions would be fined up
to RM500 under the Local Government Act.

	   ALL business operators involved in the food industry will be
required to attend a mandatory food handling course conducted by
the Selayang Municipal Council.
	   Council president Kasjoo Kadis said the certificate course would
be a requirement for food outlet operators, in both restaurants and
hawker centres, in obtaining licences to operate.
	   He said the day-long course, which will cost RM65 per person,
was crucial in view of the current cholera situation and water
shortage which called for special emphasis on cleanliness.
	   Asked if existing licence holders also needed to attend the
course, Kasjoo said attending the course would be a criteria in the
renewal of licences.
	   He said the course, which started in 1996, was an on-going
activity.

Report: Pakistan feared Israeli attack hours before nuclear detonations 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Pakistan feared an Israeli air strike on its
nuclear installations hours before it detonated five nuclear
devices last week, Israeli media reported Monday.
	   State-run Israel television said Pakistan's foreign minister
informed the United States about Israel's plans last Thursday,
hours before it carried out the tests. Pakistan believed that
Israeli planes would operate out of bases in India, the report
said.
	   The United States told Pakistan that Israel was not planning any
such attack, Israel's Channel Two Television said.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied an attack was planned. ``These reports are totally
baseless,'' he told Israel TV.
	   Israel, an undeclared nuclear power, has warned that rival
neighbors India and Pakistan's atomic tests could encourage nearby
Iran to follow suit.
	   Israel destroyed an Iraqi nuclear facility in 1981.
	   The Israeli Cabinet discussed the recent tests on the Asian
subcontinent on Monday.
	   Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan said in a statement
that Monday's visit by Iran's foreign minister to Pakistan
``strengthens Israel and the international community's calls to
make every effort in order to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear
capacity.''
	   ``The international community needs to act decisively in order
to prevent Iranian capabilities,'' he said.
	   According to Israeli officials, Iran is seeking technology to
build a bomb and is close to having its own long-range delivery
system capable of hitting Israel.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistan, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said Monday that Muslims everywhere welcomed the nuclear tests, but
dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow Pakistan
down the nuclear road.

Russian markets close in downward spiral analysis. CHANGES byline.

Eds: AMs. RECASTS with central bank comments on defending ruble,
By JOHN IAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks plunged more than 10 percent Monday
in a frenzy of selling by Russian banks and a cold shoulder from
foreign investors wary of the market's turmoil.
	   The Russian Trading System index closed 10.2 percent lower after
late panic selling gripped the market and reassuring comments from
government officials failed to calm jittery investors.
	   Monday's close matched the 10-percent fall last Wednesday, when
hectic selling caused the stock market to plummet and threatened a
run on the national currency, the ruble.
	   The market has fallen 44 percent since the beginning of May,
making it the worst performing market in the world, and there are
fears of further losses before calm is restored.
	   The Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and tripled
a key interest rate to 150 percent to persuade investors to stay in
Russia. A top bank official said Monday the interest rate would
remain unchanged.
	   ``At the present, there is no need (to change it),'' said
Alexander Potyomkin, the bank's first deputy chairman.
	   Potyomkin said the central bank will remain firm in its policy
to defend the ruble. ``We will do our best to escape that kind of
scenario,'' he told a news conference, referring to the possibility
of devaluation.
	   But investors are increasingly coming to believe that only an
international aid package will be able to save Russian markets from
a devaluation, that could lead to steep price hikes and social
unrest.
	   Boris Fyodorov, Russia's new tax chief, said Monday that
government has enough cash reserves to protect the ruble, which
closed relatively unchanged at 6.18 to the dollar Monday.
	   But Fyodorov acknowledged an additional dlrs 5 billion from the
International Monetary Fund would help stabilize the market.
	   Russian leaders have said that the economic crisis was triggered
by a combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices
for gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Monday that
economic growth predicted for this year probably would not
materialize, but was optimistic that the country could cope with
the current crisis.
	   ``If the government is able to quickly and effectively eliminate
the consequences of the past week, the stability of the real sector
of the economy will be preserved,'' he told a news conference.
	   In a move to cut government spending, Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko Monday ordered a 30 percent reduction in Cabinet
personnel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

	   THE Selayang Municipal Council hopes to collect RM32.5 million
in assessment rates this year, with RM11.2 million collected over
the first four months of the year.
	   Its president Kasjoo Kadis said notices had been sent to
ratepayers.
	   He said 81 per cent of ratepayers had settled amounts owed over
the first four months of the year, compared to 93 per cent during
the same period last year.
	   Speaking at the council's full board meeting yesterday, he said
the figure received this year could not be compared with that of
last year as there were more property owners now.
	   Kasjoo was commenting on points raised by councillor and Paya
Jeras State Assemblyman Datuk Saidin Thamby on the question of
collection of assessment rates.
	   On rubbish collection and disposal in the municipality, he said
Alam Flora Sdn Bhd would take over such services from Aug 1.
	   He said the first meeting to discuss details of the takeover
would be held on Wednesday.
	   Asked if the quantum and mode of payment had been discussed, he
said this was up to the Economic Planning Unit in the Prime
Minister's Department to decide.

Denmark's coach presents his squad for the World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's coach Bo Johansson mixed
veteran players and youthful talent in his 22-man World Cup squad
Monday.
	   Although Denmark, the 1992 European champions, played poorly in
two recent World Cup warm-up games against Norway and Sweden,
Johansson said there was ``nothing to be negative about.''
	   The side that will play in Group C against France, Saudi Arabia
and South Africa, included three safe bets _ brothers Michael and
Brian Laudrup, and veteran goalie Peter Schmeichel.
	   Michael Laudrup is the only survivor of Denmark's 1986 World Cup
side in Mexico. The 33-year-old will bid farewell to the national
team after the World Cup. His younger brother, Brian, was on the
team that upset mighty Germany to win the 1992 European
Championship in Sweden.
	   One of the world's top keepers, Schmeichel, has been suffering
from a minor injury but Johansson was confident that the Manchester
United's goalie would be fit in time for the World Cup.
	   Schmeichel ``wasn't 100 percent in shape'' when Sweden beat
Denmark 3-0 on May 28, Johansson said.
	   As substitute goalies, Johansson picked Mogens Krogh of the
Danish champion team Broendby, and sole newcomer Peter Kjaer of
Silkeborg, another Danish team.
	   The Danes have only qualified once before for a World Cup.
Denmark surprisingly failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and a defensive-minded team flopped in the 1996
European Championship in England.
	   Johansson, a Swede, has 8 wins, 2 draws and 3 defeats since he
became Denmark's coach in 1996.
	   He selected experienced defenders like Marc Rieper, Jan Heintze,
Thomas Helveg and Jes Hoegh on the team once known as ``Danish
Dynamite.''
	   Striker Ebbe Sand, the Danish league's top scorer with 28 goals,
was also selected. His first cap was against Norway on April 22
when Denmark lost 2-0.
	   Other inexperienced players are defender Rene Henriksen who
played his first match on the red-and-white team against Scotland
in March, and forward Martin Joergensen who has played three times
on the Danish side.
	   Johansson who has opted for a 4-4-2 system, said he hadn't
decided what system Denmark would play in France, adding he wanted
to avoid ``the vulnerability of playing only one system.''
	   Before heading for France, Denmark plays a friendly against
Cameroon on Friday in Copenhagen.
	   The squad:
	   Goalies _ Peter Schmeichel, Mogens Krogh, Peter Kjaer,
	   Defenders _ Jes Hoegh, Marc Rieper, Jacob Laursen, Rene
Henriksen, Soeren Colding, Jan Heintze, Michael Schjoenberg, Thomas
Helveg,
	   Midfielders _ Allan Nielsen, Per Frandsen, Morten Wieghorst,
Stig Toefting, Bjarne Goldbaek, Michael Laudrup,
	   Forwards _ Brian Laudrup, Miklos Molnar, Peter Moeller, Martin
Joergensen, Ebbe Sand.

	   SIME Darby Bhd announced that it has disposed of its resort

million cash. It also said that its subsidiary in the Philippines
has proposed to subscribe to new shares in LEC Refrigerator Plc for
STG18 million (STG1    RM6.32), representing a
51.38 per cent stake in the latter.

	   ABN Amro Bank Bhd reported a pre-tax profit of RM22 million for
the quarter ended March 31, 1998, compared to a loss of RM22
million over the previous quarter ended Dec 31, 1997.
	   The strong performance was mainly attributed to a 34 per cent
growth in net interest income and 83 per cent increase in
non-interest income, while non-interest expenses fell 10 per cent.
	   In a statement, the bank said its total net non-performing loans
remained at 0.7 per cent of total loans and advances.
	   General provisions for the period under review stood at 1.7 per
cent.
	   The bank's total loan loss cover (the ratio of specific and
general provision and interest-in-suspense to total NPL) stood at
124 per cent.
	   Total shareholders' funds grew by 10 per cent to RM163.7 million
and the bank's risk weighted capital adequacy ratio stood at 14.2
per cent.
	   The bank said its Malaysian operations currently had total
assets of RM2 billion.
	   ``The bank is preparing and investing considerable time and
resources on smoothing the way for the introduction of the new Euro
currency and in ensuring that by Jan 1 the bank will offer full
banking services to make the transition to the Euro as simple as
possible,'' it said.
	   The bank will organise a Euro seminar in Kuala Lumpur to explain
the consequences and implications of the Euro to existing and

<TEXT>
	   CANADIAN-based Bata Shoe Organisation Ltd, whose brand name is
synonymous with school shoes, is keen on developing a global
business in athletic shoes and accessories, its chief executive
Thomas J. Bata said.
	   The 83-year-old son of Tomas Bata, who founded the BSO, said the
athletics business complemented the company's plans for creating a
chain of bigger Bata retail and merchandise stores.
	   He added that the company might consider establishing Malaysia
as a base for the manufacture of Bata school shoes for the Asian
region following the success of the Bata school shoe in the
country.
	   However, the company's new endeavours will not change its
103-year tradition as a maker of quality affordable shoes.
	   ``In terms of positioning and quality, we would like to be seen
as the Rolls-Royce of the affordable shoe segment.
	   ``We do not aspire to be in the high-priced, luxury goods, niche
segment. We want to serve a wide consumer base with progressive and
affordable quality products,'' Bata said in an interview yesterday.
	   According to Bata, its Malaysian operations had done well in
marketing Bata shoe products and establishing the Bata school shoe
in the country, and would be backed up by bigger stores and wider
product range in the near future reflecting a global business
direction for the Bata Shoe Organisation.
	   ``We have been moving into a new development of bigger retail
stores to serve additional consumer groups and we are bringing a
big influence of sports/athletics into our stores.
	   ``Bata will broaden its merchandising, bringing in athletic
shoes and clothing as well as throwing in merchandise related to
today's craze about hiking and roller-blading,'' he added.
	   To date, Bata has acquired brands such as Power, Sparx, Marie
Claire, King Street and North Star.
	   ``This avenue is growing into a global-type business for us and
we will continually improve on it as well as on our other product
lines,'' said Bata.
	   He added that the Bata Shoe Organisation was seeing more
decentralisation of management and manufacturing, and believed it
could operate in relatively medium-sized manufacturing operations
in different locations worldwide to serve specific and localised
market segments.
	   ``We believe we can specialise in different products at
different locations. For example, school shoes in the Asean region
can be made in Malaysia.
	   ``Now there may be import-export duties to be considered but
they are coming down as well. As trade barriers become more relaxed
in Asia, it is a possibility to make best products in one place of
the region and we will consider Malaysia when the time comes,''
said Bata.
	   Bata currently operates two manufacturing plants, one each in
Seremban and Klang, which together churn out over eight million
pairs per year.
	   Last year the company achieved a sales turnover of RM249 million
of which exports to Europe and North America accounted for RM29
million.
	   On the current regional and local economic downturn, Bata said
sales in Asia had not been affected substantially but that growth
had stagnated at the moment. An average annual growth of about
seven per cent was recorded before the economic troubles.
	   ``We will continually improve on our business and grow in Asia
despite the current economic scenario, and will introduce new
activities.
	   ``Our confidence in Asia remains unchanged and as long as we are
willing to work hard to satisfy the consumer, we can survive,'' he
added.
	   Bata is in Kuala Lumpur in conjunction with the opening of Bata
Malaysia's retail outlet at the KLCC Suria today.
	   BSO claims to be the world's largest manufacturer and marketer
of footwear and operates in over 60 countries.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed ``deep
regret'' Monday over a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed
thousands in neighboring Afghanistan and said it would consider
sending humanitarian aid.
	   The quake, which hit Saturday, is ``the latest natural
catastrophe which occurred in the long-suffering Afghanistan,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin told the Interfax
news agency.
	   Russia has previously contributed helicopters and other
transportation devices for rescue and relief efforts.

	   NATIONAL carrier Malaysian Airlines System Bhd (MAS) announced a
pre-tax loss of RM225.38 million for the year ended March 31 1998,
representing a steep 164.5 per cent drop from the RM349.57 million
profit registered in 1997. The group turnover rose 8.7 per cent to
RM7.05 billion from RM6.31 billion previously.
	   A total of RM718.4 million foreign exchange loss was registered
and this wiped out a RM618.95 million gain MAS has derived from
sales of aircraft and spare engines. The group also registered a
translation loss of RM3.49 billion during the year against a gain
of RM164.2 million previously.

	   THE fact that the Observer newspaper has decided to launch
another attack on Malaysia hardly comes as a surprise. Indeed, the
only thing surprising about the Observer's recent salvo was that it
came so late; after all, the newspaper has been engaged in an
all-out campaign against a host of Asian and Muslim countries for
some time now.
	   In this respect we need only to remind ourselves of the simple
fact that the Observer was one of the newspapers in Britain which
saw fit to condemn Muslims and the Muslim world in toto after the
bombing of the FBI headquarters in Oklahoma in the United States
some years ago.
	   When the facts came to light and it was discovered that the
bombing was the work of a group of white racial supremacists, the
Observer, like the rest of the Western press, chose to keep quiet
about its part in demonising the Muslims of the world.
	   Such is the moral character of this newspaper which claims to be
the ``defender of the truth''.
	   Another self-appointed ``defender of the truth'' is Britain's
Guardian newspaper, which has of late taken a keen interest in the
affairs of Indonesia, Malaysia and the rest of Asean.
	   As always, such ``concern'' comes at the point of a barbed pen
which distorts the picture that it tries to draw in the process.
	   The Guardian recently featured a report on the visit to
Southeast Asia by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon
Brown. The paper's reporter, who followed slavishly in the
footsteps of the Chancellor, noted how Asians seemed to bow before
the presence of this British politician as if he were some
munificent white god that had descended from on high.
	   But the magical charm of the Chancellor's tour was interrupted
only when he set foot on Malaysian soil and was told that Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad was too busy to see him.
The Guardian reporter dutifully recorded in a sarcastic tone that
the Malaysian PM was not inclined to ``receive this representative
of the Evil West''. (The thought that the PM may have had other
more important things to do obviously did not occur to the
reporter).
	   However this sarcastic thrust was blunted by the Guardian's own
incompetence. Having cast Dr Mahathir in an unfavourable light, it
tried to juxtapose him against his more ``moderate'' deputy,
``Ibrahim Anwar''
	   (sic). Even a child in kindergarten would know by now that the
Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia's real name is Anwar Ibrahim, and
not vice-versa! The so-called ``defenders of truth'', such as the
Guardian and Observer, would thus do well by serving as the
guardians of grammar and spelling first.
	   How should Malaysia and Malaysians react to this sort of
verbiage disguised as reportage? Well, a modicum of intelligence
and introspection would come in handy at this point. We need to
consider the broader socio-economic and political context within
which these attacks are taking place.
	   The Observer, like many other newspapers in Britain, is in a
state of crisis. The paper's circulation figures are unpredictable
and in the end it is market sentiment which decides what comes on
the news and what kind of news will sell.
	   In a country where sensational news items such as the death of
Princess Diana and UFOs sell better than stories about how the
British government has allowed British companies like Sandlines to
sell arms and rent mercenaries abroad, it is hardly surprising that
sensational stories about the bizarre and exotic customs of the
East tend to go down well with a jaded readership at home.
	   This is reflected in the contents of some of the better
newspapers in Britain as well. The Guardian, for example, has
significantly cut its number of features from abroad. Once, the
paper boasted of having a page devoted solely to African and Third
World issues. Today, it features a page devoted to the affairs of
the US instead.
	   To make matters worse, papers such as the Guardian and Observer
have begun to ``dumb down'' their coverage of foreign affairs to
appeal to a broader spectrum of readers who seem to crave stories
about tortures, killings, bizarre and outlandish rituals and exotic
diets of foreigners.
	   The lurid and sensational reporting that has come from papers
such as these are thus merely part and parcel of a broader
scenario, where the British press is slowly coming to terms with
the painful reality that their halcyon days have long gone by.
	   Resting on their laurels, they pine for the days when British
newspapers were worthy of the name and conveniently overlook the
fact that, today, even the pages of the Guardian and Observer are
used to wrap fish and chips.

	   LEGEND QDI has announced the latest Brilliant Series
motherboards which the company said incorporates Intel's latest
Pentium II class 440BX accelerator graphics port (AGP) set and
attains the PC100 technological edge.
	   Its first two models - Brilliant I and Brilliant IV - are the
first generation of Legend QDI's motherboards to meet PC100's
specifications, which according to the company is recognised as the
industry standard for personal computer (PC) architecture.
	   The motherboards help boost the performance of systems running
on 100 megahertz (MHz) and support substantial data throughput for
three-dimensional (3-D) and multimedia applications. Legend QDI
said the 440BX motherboard is the first solution to realise this
concept (which it expects to be the mainstream of the computer
industry in the next decade) in the marketplace.
	   The BX motherboard is capable of running at 100MHz front side
bus (FSB), a technology which will restrict bottlenecks from
prevailing 66MHz system clock frequency.
	   Legend QDI said the new BX platform increases the overall
performance of the system significantly by running the system clock
from 66 up to 100MHz.
	   Besides supporting a 100MHz system bus speed, the 440BX
motherboard is capable of supporting 100MHz synchronous dynamic
random access memory (SDRAM).
	   The AGP performance is also optimised with the increase in SDRAM
bus speed. Compared to the LX platform, AGP's new architecture and
its ability to store 3-D texture data in the main memory at 100MHz
bus speed can be ascertained under the BX platform, according to
Legend QDI.
	   Other features in the Brilliant series are SpeedEasy
(jumper-free for CPU speed setting), PowerEasy (a tool for
upgrading) and LogoEasy (logo utility).

Azerbaijan court sentences 20 in failed coup plot 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The Azerbaijan Supreme Court sentenced
20 people Monday to jail terms ranging from 1-1/2 to 15 years for
their involvement in a 1995 coup attempt.
	   Anvar Gafarly, once the spokesman for former Prime Minister
Suret Huseinov, was sentenced to eight years in jail. Journalist
Rasim Agayev, a former spokesman for former President Ayaz
Mutalibov, was given four years.
	   Since 1995, about 200 coup participants have been sentenced to
jail terms and about 40 others have been sentenced to death.
However, Azerbaijan suspended the death penalty in 1993, and there
have been no executions.
	   The failed 1995 coup attempt was led by former Interior Minister
Rovshan Dzhavadov, who tried to seize power in this former Soviet
republic with an elite unit of police officers.
	   Also Monday, the court opened a criminal case against former
parliamentary chairman Yakub Mamedov, who was acting president of
Azerbaijan in 1992. He was charged with failure to notify law
enforcement agencies of preparations for an earlier coup attempt.

Fine wine fraud; water, sugar, other additives may taint a Margaux 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE HUTTEAU
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ A prestigious Bordeaux wine may not be
all its label claims. Authorities have discovered water in the
Chateau-Giscours, and even some sugar, milk and acid, and taken the
case to court, judicial sources and the newspaper Le Monde reported
Monday.
	   An investigation shows that not only were water, milk and
certain acids added to the wine -- a Margaux that is one of the
most noted ``grand cru'' of the Medoc region. But there also was
allegedly a mixing of vintages and inferior wines from elsewhere,
the judicial sources said.
	   Such trickery is tantamount to treachery in the wine business,
strictly controlled to maintain the kind of quality that is
synonymous with fine French wines.
	   The judicial sources in Bordeaux, speaking on condition they not
be named, said that several officials of the domain, one of the
most imposing in the Medoc region, have been placed under
investigation, a step short of being charged, for illicit
practices.
	   The judicial sources would not identify the suspects.
	   Le Monde, which broke the story in a front-page article,
identified those placed under investigation as wine expert Regis
Froidefond and Jean-Marie Ferrandez who for four months headed the
company marketing the wine.
	   Dutch billionaire businessman Eric Albada-Jeigersma, who has
bought part of the domain, was questioned in the investigation, Le
Monde reported.
	   The Bordeaux prosecutors office opened its investigation in 1995
after complaints by a government office that oversees competition
and fraud complained. Acting on information from a former employee,
the office discovered a mixture of vintages and inferior wines, the
judicial sources said.
	   Water and sugar were also allegedly added to some vats, the
sources said. Le Monde reported that milk and certain acids were
likewise detected.
	   None of the additives makes the wine dangerous for the consumer,
the sources said, but they could ruin the chateau, disparage the
Margaux wines and there was speculation it could even shake up the
rising Bordeaux wine prices.

	   THE situation in regional stock markets may be still uncertain
and all eyes remain focused on developments in Indonesia but on a
global perspective investors and speculators should also be keeping
a watchful eye on what's happening on Wall Street.
	   One phenomenon that an investor should always remember when
venturing into any stock market is that when almost everybody least
expects something to happen, that very thing will take place.
	   The Dow Jones average, which was reaching one high after another
some weeks ago, was supposed to continue its record-breaking run
and hit the sky by now.
	   However, what has actually happened is that the Dow has pulled
back in recent weeks and dropped by 70.25 points to 8,899.95 last
Friday -something totally unexpected by optimistic forecasters
earlier on. By all accounts, the Dow should continue to shoot up,
given the fact that the US economy is doing well and the inflation
and economic figures look good.
	   Therefore, the Dow should continue to be good as well, or so
goes the reasoning.
	   In contrast to the US economy, the economic and financial
situation in Japan, the world's second largest economic power, is
really pathetic.
	   The Japanese situation is such that whatever is being done to
stimulate its economy and get it out of the financial mess, it is
never enough and something more and much better is called for.
	   Given such an unfortunate set of circumstances, it is no wonder
that the Tokyo stock market - once even considered on the way to
becoming mightier than Wall Street - has been humbled and seems to
be going nowhere.
	   Given a choice, it would be a safe assumption to advise
investors that they should avoid Tokyo and go for stock markets
which are holding up better. However, it has been often suggested
that a seemingly sick stock market may provide potentially better
opportunities for long-term gain than healthy ones which provide
limited profit-making opportunities over the long run.
	   The more sickly stock markets are probably selling at their
historical lows and therefore an investor taking the long-term view
can expect prices to rise much higher when the stock market moves
out of its bottom and begins to take off.
	   A sick market has the potential to get well and when it does
become healthier, this will translate into higher prices and
capital gains for the investor who is courageous enough to buy
stocks when the market was ailing.
	   If a stock market is already healthy with stock prices selling
at their historical highs, there isn't much potential for profit
for the investor who picks up prices at that high level.
	   This is not to suggest that investors should only scout around
for sick companies to buy their stocks because what is being
suggested is that if they are global investors, they should not be
deterred from going into sick stock markets just because they are
unwell.
	   A stock market may be sick but there are individual listed
companies which are well managed with good assets and earnings but
whose stock prices are pulled down together with that of the bad
companies.
	   What the investor should do is to seek out the good apples from
the bad ones in an ailing stock market.

	   HENGELO, Netherlands (AP) _ Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie
bettered the men's 10,000 meter world record by five seconds Monday
finishing in 26 minutes 22.77 seconds at the Adriaan Paulen
Memorial track.
	   He shattered the nine-month old mark of 26:27.85 set by Kenyan
Paul Tergat in Brussels on August 27 last year.
	   Gebreselassie ran the last nine laps of the track with only
lapped runners for company after the last of the five Ethiopian
pacemakers he'd brought along dropped out.
	   The Ethiopian clocked a half-way split time of 13:11.53 over the
first five kilometers.

	   FOR decades, agriculture played a dominant role in the Malaysian
economy.
	   Rubber, palm oil, cocoa and timber products were the major
primary commodities that contributed significantly to the growth of
Gross Domestic Product, employment and export earnings.
	   The agriculture sector as a whole contributed more than 50 per
cent of export earnings during the 60s and 70s.
	   Agricultural products are subjected to price fluctuations, and
the inflexibility of demand and supply make it difficult to plan
their development. They are also subjected to tariff and non-tariff
barriers that curtail their developments.
	   The huge drop in the international prices of these commodities
in the 70s and 80s dealt a severe blow to the once striving
agriculture-based Malaysian economy.
	   This led to structural economic reforms in the 80s and beyond
and a shift in the economy from dependence on the primary sector to
the promotion of export-led manufacturing sector.
	   Guided by the First Industrial Master Plan, 1986-1995 and the
Second Industrial Master Plan, 1996-2005, heavy emphasis was given
to boosting the manufacturing and services related sectors in
Malaysia, with tremendous results.
	   The manufacturing sector is now the engine of Malaysia's
economic growth and contributes significantly to export earnings
and employment, superseding the contribution of the agriculture
sector.
	   The contributions of the agriculture sector to GDP consequently
declined to 18.7 per cent in 1990, 13.6 per cent in 1995 and is
expected to further decline to 10.5 per cent in 2000.
	   So is its contribution to employment and export earnings. Its
contribution to export earning dropped from 26 per cent in 1990 to
18 per cent in 1995 and is expected to drop further to 22.2 per
cent in 1990 and 13.1 per cent in 1995.
	   The positive aspects of these declining contributions, however,
have been the corresponding increases in agricultural value-added
products, labour productivity and land-labour ratio.
	   From a policy point of view, the structural change is a success
as it has provided Malaysia the path to faster economic development
and growth.
	   More importantly, the change will lead to Malaysia being an
industrialised country by the year 2020.
	   The structural economic reforms enabled Malaysia to experience
high economic growth of above eight per cent per year for almost a
decade, among the most vibrant economies in Asia.
	   Discriminatory policy treatment in favour of the vibrant
manufacturing and property sectors at the expense of the
agriculture sector, however, has its drawbacks. This is
particularly clear during the current economic problem.
	   The declining property market and the slowing down of
manufacturing growth and exports brought about by the financial
downturn have severely affected overall economic growth.
	   The competitiveness of Malaysian exports is questionable,
especially those with high import content of inputs.
	   More surprising is the current account deficit in the balance of
payments which, among others, can be attributed to our high bill of
food imports, which was in the region of RM9 billion last year.
	   The high bill of food imports, while acceptable in times of
prosperous growth, is unacceptable during a slowdown. Questions
have arisen as to our capability and capacity of producing our
domestic food resources.
	   With abundant land resources and thousands of plant species and
a variety of animal husbandary available, the high food import only
shows that less attention has been given to produce these food
resources in a bigger way.
	   Most alarming is that, not only human food but even animal and
fish feed are mostly imported, thus contributing to the high import
content of locally produced chicken and farm-bred fish.
	   The current economic problem is in a way a blessing in disguise.
The immediate response of both the Federal and State governments to
revert to boosting agricultural production is most welcome.
	   Indeed, there are ample opportunities for both the public and
private sectors to venture into agricultural development in a big
way to boost production, not only to provide food security but also
to boost food processing and pharmaceutical manufacturing
activities.
	   The economic problem also revealed the need to provide equal
treatment to the agriculture sector in our development process,
alongside that given to the manufacturing sector.
	   In addition to giving priority for approving land for
large-scale agricultural production, some form of fiscal and
financial incentives should be put in place.
	   Agro-based research support should be strengthened to cover
marketing aspects of agricultural produce such as processing,
handling and quality control.
	   Marketing channels should be strengthened through a more
business-like public organisation. Infrastructure support, where
necessary, should be provided.
	   Efforts should also be made to identify the type of crops with
high demand and output value.
	   In addition to rice, fruits and vegetables, attention should be
given to growing herbs, spices and ulam in a big way.
	   These plants are not only available locally for large-scale
production but also contain medicinal properties that can be used
to produce traditional medicine and other pharmaceutical products.
	   Fish production is another area with high economic potential,
yet under- exploited. The Department of Fisheries forecast that by
the year 2010, fish production will reach 900,000 metric tonnes
from inshore fisheries, 600,000 mt from aquaculture and 430,000 mt
from deep sea fisheries, with an estimated value of more than RM6
billion.
	   There are vast opportunities for utilising mining ponds and
lakes for inland aquaculture.
	   There is also great potential for deep-sea fishing particularly
in the South China Sea, which is still under-exploited.
	   What is required is the provision of financial and non-financial
incentives to attract private sector investment in the fishing
industry.
	   Now is the opportune time to give more attention to the
agriculture sector. The current economic problem has taught us a
lesson that discriminatory policy treatment in favour of a
particular sector (manufacturing) at the expense of another sector
(agriculture) does not guarantee sustainable development and
growth.
	   Agricultural and manufacturing production should therefore be
given equal treatment in our development process.
	   A thorough review of the National Agriculture Policy should be
expedited to provide an updated policy in this endeavour.
	   However, we must bear in mind two realities. Firstly, the
current economic problem is temporary in nature and the Malaysian
economy is expected to rebound in due time and secondly, we have to
accept the fact that Malaysia is fast losing her comparative
advantage in agricultural production.
	   As such, the only rational justification for increasing domestic
agricultural production is to be based on food security
consideration rather than a temporary and short-term improvement in
competitiveness due to current depreciation of the national
currency.
	   Another option is the liberalisation of agricultural trade,
particularly of products where Malaysia has no potential
comparative advantage.

	   BANK Negara says it constantly listens to suggestions from the
market, but nevertheless prefers banks to stick to the stipulated
plan to maintain credit growth at 15 per cent by the end of this
year.
	   The credit growth plan was introduced earlier as part of
pre-emptive measures to protect soundness of the domestic banking
system amid the regional financial crisis.
	   The banking system's rapid moves to tighten credit extensions
attracted criticisms from the market, with many complaining about
difficulties in obtaining credit facilities to finance their
businesses.
	   ``We constantly receive views and comments and do so with an
open mind.
	   It is not the central bank's way to dismiss suggestions from the
market outrightly,'' Bank Negara Governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don
told newsmen at a briefing on Saturday.
	   His deputy, Datuk Fong Weng Phak, estimated that about RM60
billion should still be available within the banking system in the
next eight months, based on the present credit growth plan.
	   The money is there, although potential borrowers must do a bit
more to convince their respective bankers before they can have
access to the funds, he said.
	   While banks have been criticised for being overly cautious in
extending credit facilities, several bankers contacted in recent
weeks said they themselves are facing constraints to lend actively.
	   Although the preliminary total pre-tax profit recorded by the
domestic banking system stood at a high of RM7.9 billion for 1997,
the actual profit is expected to be substantially lower as banking
institutions have been required to provide higher provisions to
build up loan loss reserves and strengthen their balance sheets.
	   Briefing newsmen, Ahmad Don outlined immediate prospects for the
Malaysian economy, one of the determining factors for recovery
being that banks continue to lend within the credit plan figures.
	   ``Many banks over-extended themselves during the economic boom
period,''
	   said Bank Negara assistant governor Datuk Abdul Murad Khalid,
who was also present at the briefing.
	   Echoing Murad's sentiments was assistant governor Dr Zeti Akhtar
Aziz who summarised all the pre-emptive measures instituted in the
banking sector within the past year, saying they have brought
positive results to shore up banks' fundamentals in facing the
economic uncertainty.
	   The Malaysian economy charted its first quarterly decline since
the mid- 1980s when it contracted by 1.8 per cent in the first
quarter of 1998 on an annual basis compared with a 6.9 per cent
expansion in last year's fourth quarter.
	   The banking sector felt impact of the regional financial crisis
during the first quarter of this year as both deposits and loan
activities recorded declines due to both supply and demand factors.
	   The fall in domestic demand and slowing down of economic
activity adversely affected the debt-servicing capability of
debtors, resulting in some financial institutions facing a
deterioration in their asset quality.
	   ``The banking system is sound. It is under strain, but
manageable,'' Ahmad Don said, adding that the central bank will
maintain the present monetary policy and interest rates, as
inflation figures are showing a rising trend.
	   As at March 31 this year the level of non-performing loans of
the banking system stood at 9.1 per cent.
	   He also said that Bank Negara will continue with ways to
strengthen the industry further, among others by actively
encouraging merger of banks, insurance companies and discount
houses.

	   SABAH-based Wong Chik Lim Holding Sdn Bhd, in a tie-up with MOS
Food Services Inc of Japan, yesterday opened its flagship MOS
Burger fastfood restaurant at the Suria KLCC shopping complex in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   The joint venture company, Moriyoshi Foods (M) Sdn Bhd, now
plans to open between 10 and 15 MOS Burger outlets in Malaysia over
the next three years.
	   The second outlet is planned for The Summit Subang USJ shopping
mall in Selangor in July.
	   Moriyoshi Foods managing director Eric Wong Shew Yee said
yesterday the company expects a turnover of RM2 million this year
and up to RM6 million next year.
	   Speaking after the opening of the MOS Burger outlet, he said
Moriyoshi Foods also has the rights for Singapore and has already
opened seven outlets there since 1993.
	   The MOS Burger chain - Japan's answer to McDonald's - has been a
runaway success in Japan since it began operations in 1972 with
over 1,500 outlets there now.
	   The only burger franchise listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
since 1988, the company has also expanded to Hawaii, Taiwan and
China. Apart from burger outlets, it also operates Chirimentei
Chinese noodle restaurants.
	   MOS Food Japan vice-president Eitaro Sano, who opened the KLCC
Suria outlet, said the company plans to expand further globally
with the aim of adding 100 outlets annually. In Malaysia, each
outlet costs about RM700,000 to set up.
	   The distinctive aspect of the MOS Burger is that each is made
fresh when the customer makes the order. Also, unique to MOS Burger
is its offerings of a rice burger and a teriyaki burger.
	   MOS Burger draws its acronym for Mountain, Ocean and Sun, and
aims to promote a healthier lifestyle for the people.

new service called the Y2K Factory to provide solutions for the
millennium bug.
	   Scheduled to be launched next month, Y2K Factory is aimed at
sparing companies the trouble of recruiting extra personnel to deal
with the Y2K problem, hence allowing them to concentrate on
business more effectively.
	   According to Software Dynamics' business development executive
Amran Ariffin, the company uses two main software programs, the
SoftFactory/2000 and HourGlass 2000, to address the problem.
	   ``We are the local distributor for both software and these
complement each other to provide a complete and comprehensive Y2K
solution,'' he said.
	   Besides providing the service, the company also sells
SoftFactory/2000 and HourGlass 2000 packages to companies wanting
to develop in-house Y2K solutions. SoftFactory/2000 is a toolset
and methodology designed to enable information technology (IT)
organisations rectify the Y2K problem with a set of intelligent
rules specifically optimised for logic-based remedy.
	   Available in three modules - Revolve/2000, SmartFind/2000 and
Workbench/2000 - SoftFactory/2000 helps solve the impending Y2K
date-change crisis affecting organisations with Cobol-based legacy
systems.
	   ``Even though SoftFactory/2000 is based on Cobol, it can also
check Fortran, C++ and other basic text-written programs, except
RPG,'' said Amran.
	   Revolve/2000 is a tool designed to identify and categorise Y2K
code in several languages and the package supports multiple
Y2K-conversion methodologies. It also checks the date formats in
the program.
	   ``A lot of companies hesitate to buy the Y2K program because
they think it is a waste of money to buy solutions solely for
solving the Y2K problem,'' Amran said. ``But with Revolve/2000,
users can still use it after the turn of the century for activities
such as documentation and charting purposes.''
	   The second module, the SmartFind/2000, is a rule-based analysis
tool for identifying lines of Cobol codes that require the remedy
to become Y2K-compliant, and it is the core of the SoftFactory/2000
solution. It is optimised for Y2K conversions utilising logic-based
``windowing'' fixes to the century date-change problem.
	   Software Dynamics said the rule-based detection methodology of
SmartFind/2000 is considered to be the most effective compared to
other methods which only identify date fields and requires no
conversion and extensive manual intervention.
	   The windowing solution identifies only dates which require
fixing, such as those used in some calculations and comparisons,
and leaves the two-digit dates in place, but adds logic to
differentiate between centuries.
	   The Workbench/2000 module, meanwhile, provides a complete
personal computer (PC)-based testing environment for users'
modified code. It gives a straightforward and accurate testing
method for the Y2K program conversion.
	   To complete the checking system, the company uses the HourGlass
2000 which the company claims is the only comprehensive
date-simulation tool that lets users run specified programs, jobs
or sessions, without affecting the others. It provides
Y2K-compliance testing for in-house applications, third-party
applications and utilities, running non-Y2K- compliant applications
on the first day of year 2000, and rerunning old or future months
or year-end jobs.
	   However, the HourGlass 2000 is only available for the HP 3000
and 9000, and MVS systems.
	   As the local distributor, Software Dynamics expects to generate
RM2 million to RM3 million in sales by the end of this year. ``We
believe Y2K Factory will contribute about 80 per cent of the sales
while the rest is from pushing the boxes,'' Amran said.
	   The Revolve/2000 module carries a price tag of US$52,500
(RM199,500) whereas cost of the SmartFind/2000 depends on the
number of lines of codes used in the program and the Workbench/2000
is priced according to the number of seats.

	   ABN AMRO Bank Bhd posted a pre-tax profit of RM22 million for
the first quarter ended March 31 1998 compared to a loss of RM22
million in the last three months of 1997.
	   The strong performance was attributable to a 34 per cent
increase in net interest income and 83 per cent in non-interest
income, while non-interest expense fell by 10 per cent.
	   Given the encouraging profits recorded for the first quarter,
the bank foresee its continuous commitment in the Malaysian banking
industry by expanding its business strategy as the opportunity
arises, its managing director Huibert Boumeester says.
	   Announcing its quarterly results, ABN said that its total net
non-performing loans (NPLs) remain at 0.7 per cent of total loans
and advances, while general provisions stood at 1.7 per cent.
	   The bank's total loan loss - covering the ratio of specific and
general provision, and interest-in-suspense to total NPLs - stood
high at 124 per cent. There was no new specific provision made in
the period reviewed as adequate previsions were made in the
previous quarter.
	   As at March 31, the bank's risk weighted capital ratio stood at
14.2 per cent while total shareholders' funds grew by 10 per cent
during the period under review from the previous RM148.6 million to
RM163.7 million.
	   ABN is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN AMRO NV and is one of
the oldest foreign financial institutions in Malaysia. Its overseas
associates, ABN AMRO Bank is one of the major banks involved in the
Euro, the single currency in Europe that will be introduced on
January 1 1999.
	   The implementations of Euro will radically change the banking
system in Europe, whereby banks will have fewer counterparts and
will choose those which sell the best products.
	   ``There will be intense competition between the biggest network
banks while the smaller ones will either enter into alliances or
come to banks such as ABN AMRO to do the processing for them,''
Boumeester said.
	   He said the bank is preparing and investing considerable time
and resources on smoothing the way for the introduction of the new
currency.
	   ``We hope by January 1 1999, we would be able to offer full
banking services for the transition to the Euro as simple as
possibele,'' he said.
	   These will range from treasury and cash management facilities
through trade and project finance, asset management and the full
menu of capital market services.

	   HENGELO, Netherlands (AP) _ Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie
bettered the men's 10,000 meter world record by five seconds Monday
finishing in 26 minutes 22.77 seconds at the Adriaan Paulen
Memorial track.
	   He shattered the nine-month old mark of 26:27.85 set by Kenyan
Paul Tergat in Brussels on August 27 last year.
	   Gebreselassie ran the last nine laps of the track with only
lapped runners for company after the last of the five Ethiopian
pacemakers he'd brought along dropped out.
	   The Ethiopian clocked a half-way split time of 13:11.53 over the
first five kilometers.

	   THE fast pace of today's businesses and the Internet explosion
are placing a heavy demand for information on networks. As a
result, there is an urgent need for new applications and a
centralised enterprise storage framework, according to EMC Computer
Systems (South Asia) Pte Ltd's general manager Paul Rath.
	   ``Enterprise storage means consolidated storage that is capable
of supporting multiple operating systems and multiple mainframes,
Unix and Windows NT servers on a single system,'' Rath said.
	   ``The need for a shared, consolidated repository of business
information has never been greater. The real value of enterprise
storage is that it stores and retrieves data from all major
computing platforms in both the mainframe and open systems
environments,'' he added.
	   Enterprise-wide connectivity is regarded as an important element
of enterprise storage as it allows information system (IS) managers
to consolidate packets of information into data centres for
competitive advantage.
	   As a result, IS managers are no longer just managing disparate
technologies and data but information which now rests in a
centralised location.
	   To address this, EMC Corp, a worldwide provider of enterprise
storage devices, is promoting the use of its architectures covering
both hardware and software. For hardware, EMC offers Mosaic:2000,
while Intelligent Storage Architecture (ISA) is used for the
software.
	   ISA is designed to create a computing environment driven by
consolidated information from across the enterprise.
	   Built on Mosaic:2000, the EMC hardware architecture is aimed at
bringing together the best disk, memory and system software
technologies.
	   ``We don't manufacture storage disks, instead we formed
alliances with popular database developers, hardware manufacturers
and systems integrators to provide best-of-breed solutions,'' Rath
told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``With EMC solutions, we give organisations a more timely access
to information and this will lead to better business decisions.
Moreover, a good enterprise storage must be able to provide
connectivity, cascadable and information-centric solutions and this
is what EMC products address,''
	   he added.
	   On EMC business performance, EMC Computer Systems (Far East)
Ltd's country manager Zulkifli Latiff said more than 1,000 units of
EMC storage devices have been installed locally since the middle of
last year.
	   EMC claimed to be the world's largest supplier of enterprise
storage devices with a 50 per cent share of the mainframe and the
open systems markets.

	   MALAYSIAN Airline System Bhd (MAS) is planning to sell its used
aircraft and borrow from a few foreign financial institutions to
raise money for its capital investments totalling RM1.81 billion
for the current year ending March 31 1999.
	   MAS' treasury manager, Mr Low Chee Teng, said the group is
negotiating with a few foreign parties for loans which MAS is
hoping to secure and these to be guaranteed by export credit
agencies in the respective institutions' countries.
	   Out of the total investment, RM1.54 billion will be used to pay
for four aircraft MAS will receive later this year and in 1999,
including spare engine payments.
	   ``Since the four aircraft are manufactured in the US and
Britain, we are hoping that the export credit agencies of the
countries can guarantee the debt acquired,'' Low said.
	   Low, however, declined to name the financial institutions
involved.
	   Meanwhile, MAS chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli once again
successfully kept the group's much talked about restructuring plans
under wraps.
	   In a much eagerly anticipated briefing to the media and analysts
last Saturday, Tajudin said details on the restructuring of the
national carrier will be revealed this year.
	   Declining to answer questions on the subject, the chairman who
seems visibly upset, only said: ``We will come out with the details
later.''
	   Meanwhile, the treasury manager said actual implementation of
the restructuring exercise will take longer than a year. He said
that MAS is still deliberating on the final structure of the plan.
	   Tajudin also cleared the air over the exercise which he said is
not an attempt to satisfy the business interests of specific groups
of shareholders in MAS.
	   In a statement signed by Tajudin himself, he said, that
shareholders, regardless of the size of their investment, are
valued partners in MAS.
	   Hence, no party will be disenfranchised in any manner, Tajudin
stressed.
	   Earlier reports had said that Tajudin was planning to sell the
company's aircraft to a new company, MAS Capital, which would then
lease the aircraft back to MAS.
	   It was also said that the proceeds from the transaction would be
used by Tajudin to partly pay off his personal debts.
	   Suffering from a RM225 million pre-tax loss in its last year
ended March 31 1998, MAS has suspended flights to Madrid, Macau,
Davao, Vientiane and Pusan. It has also deferred taking delivery of
14 aircraft.
	   In addition, MAS has stopped extending the leases of its
aircraft, cancelled any option aircraft, modified aircraft orders
to save costs, and it has also offered to lease or sell its
existing aircraft.
	   Currently, 14 aircraft are being offered for lease or sale by
MAS.
	   Datuk Bashir Ahmad, the group's executive vice president, in
briefing investment analysts at the same function, mentioned that
MAS will now shift its growth emphasis to long-haul services,
expecially to North America and Europe.
	   This is as a result of the group's capacity reduction with the
selling, leasing and the delivery deferment of aircraft.
	   To concentrate on the long flight market, MAS will reduce the
frequency of flights on the Orient road, to countries such as South
Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

	   MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial Co Ltd (MEI) of Japan yesterday
announced that it has established a new company in Malaysia to
specifically handle treasury management of all its 20 subsidiaries
in the country.
	   The new company, 100 per cent-owned Panasonic Financial Centre
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, would start operations on Monday.
	   With a paid-up capital of RM2 million, its business will be the
rationalisation and risk management of funds and foreign exchange
within Matsushita subsidiaries in Malaysia.
	   Previously, the duty was handled by each subsidiary.
	   Asia Matsushita News Centre spokesman Keiji Furukawa said the
decision was taken to ensure that the Malaysian subsidiaries could
concentrate on their respective businesses without having to worry
about currency fluctuations particularly with the weakening
ringgit.
	   ``The new company will act as a sort of a bank for all these
subsidiaries. It will manage the combined fund of these 20
companies, possibly see what the cash-rich subsidiaries can do to
assist those in need of cash.
	   ``It will also minimise the foreign exchange risk for the
group,''
	   Furukawa said.
	   The Malaysian company is MEI's seventh treasury company and
sixth outside Japan. The others are in London, New York, Hong Kong
and Singapore.
	   MEI's subsidiaries in Malaysia contributed 400 billion Yen
(RM11.2 billion) to the consolidated turnover of 7.67 trillion Yen
in 1996. For the last financial year ended March 31, 1998, MEI
recorded a 7.89 trillion Yen consolidated turnover.
	   MEI, founded in Osaka, Japan, in 1918, is one of the world's
leading producers of electronic and electric products for consumer,
business and industrial use.
	   It employs more than 275,00 employees worldwide with overseas
operations that include over 200 companies in 44 countries.
	   In Malaysia, the first MIE subsidiary, Matsushita Electric Co
(M) Bhd (Melcom), was set up in 1966 in Shah Alam, Selangor and
currently employs about 2,500 workers.

	   CANON Marketing (M) Sdn Bhd has launched a series of new
products under three categories of its camera/video divisions
consisting of three digital video camcorders, two Advanced Photo
System (APS) cameras and three EF lenses.
	   The new digital video camcorders - XL-1, MV-1 and MV-100 - are
the top line of Canon's digital video camcorders which were
introduced locally.
	   According to Canon Malaysia's vice chairman Shuichi Tsukahara,
the introduction of the digital video camcorders are in line with
the company's commitment to introduce advanced photographic
technology.
	   ``We introduced digital camcorders because we have the advantage
of manufacturing advanced digital technology in other Canon
products,'' he said.
	   The XL1 digital video camcorders are based on the 3CCD
technology.
	   Designed for professional film makers who need portability and
high-quality recordings, the new camcorder has a high-resolution
projection with a 16x optical zoom and SuperRange Optical Image
Stabilisation plus audio recording.
	   The XL-1 is wrapped with magnesium alloy which Canon claims is
20 times stronger and lighter than conventional camcorder casings.
	   The second model, the DM-MV1, is a mini digital-video camcorder
which incorporates the Digital ``IC'' (1-CCD chip) processing of
wide-band RGB colour filters. Canon said with its scan system, the
XL-1 is the first three mode DV camcorders in the world.
	   Aimed at advanced camcorder enthusiasts and professional users
that want a higher level of image and colour resolution, the MV1
provides two Movie Modes - Normal and Progressive Scan Mode, and a
Photo Mode.
	   Other than the user-friendly feature, it is also equipped with a
colour viewfinder and a two-inch LCD monitor. The model also comes
with a 14x optical zoom, 35x digital zoom and Canon's FlexiZone
Control and Optical Image Stabiliser.
	   The third model, the MV100 is, by Canon's estimates, the world's
smallest digital camcorder with LCD display. With a dimension of
118.5 by 85.5 by 55.7 millimetres, the camera has the ability to
give 44x digital zoom.
	   Powered by a new lithium battery pack, the digital camera is
able to project 180,000 pixel images on its 2.5-inch LCD screen.
The LCD screen can be adjusted to a variety of positions for high
or low angle shooting, playback at different angles and it can also
be lifted by 180 degrees.
	   Apart from the Easy Recording, the MV100 also includes Auto,
Sport, Portrait, Spotlight, Sand and Snow, and Low light for
customised situations.
	   For videographers, there are seven digital effects incorporated
which are fade, wipe, scroll, black and white, strobe, art and
sepia. As for accessories, the product comes standard with a colour
finder unit for bright area and a docking unit for playing on TV.
	   The two new APS cameras launched were the EOS IX7 and IXUS Z70
models.
	   The EOS IX7 is Canon's smallest and lightest SLR camera and is
the second single-lens reflex camera introduced by the company that
incorporates the benefits of EOS EF lenses and APS. It incorporates
a set of IX functions like mid-roll film change, IX data exchange
for Print Quality Improvement (PQI), drop-in loading and print
format selection. It also has nine AE modes, three point
auto-focusing features with six zone evaluative metering, automatic
or manual focus point selection, focus point indicator, automatic
exposure bracketing and a built-in retractable flash with TTL
exposure metering.
	   The IXUS Z70 model is another compact APS camera that has 3x

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The World Bank is ready to give Armenia a dlrs 30
million loan to repair the water supply and sewage systems in the
capital, Yerevan, a Russian news agency said Monday.
	   Vagram Nersesyants, the bank's representative in Yerevan, said
the credit proposal was agreed to following negotiations with
Armenia's central bank. The proposal will be submitted to the World
Bank for approval June 11, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The credit, to be repaid over 35 years, must also be ratified by
the Armenian parliament.
	   The repairs are needed to prevent losses of drinking water and
to stop sewage from leaking into the water supply, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 homes in Yerevan have been flooded in what
officials call the heaviest rains in 20 years. Several dozen people
have been left homeless, said the head of the State Department for
Emergency Situations, Karapat Safarian.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels killed 18 Turkish soldiers
and 14 pro-government village guards in fighting in southeastern
Turkey, a Kurdish news agency reported.
	   The Germany-based DEM news agency said the soldiers died when
rebels ambushed a military convoy in the province of Diyarbakir.

India denies it plans another nuclear test, urges nuclear talks

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Monday rejected reports it was
planning another nuclear test, following its call on all nuclear
weapons states to start negotiations for a nuclear weapons accord.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan's claims that India was surreptitiously
preparing to conduct more tests next month was ``surprising'' _ and
wrong.
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing, and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   His ministry reiterated India's long-standing call for
international talks on reducing nuclear weapons in a statement
Sunday.
	   Despite Singh's firm statement that India's tests were over, the
country's Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram was
quoted by local news agencies as telling fellow scientists at a
forum in Bombay on Monday that small tests might be carried out for
research purposes _ but ``only if necessary.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   India escalated the longtime Indo-Pakistan rivalry to the
nuclear level with five tests May 11-13. In response, Pakistan
claimed to have detonated six nuclear devices last week.
	   Khan said he had credible information that India was ``already
in the process of preparing a new test site ... to blast somewhere
in the first or second week in July.''
	   Pakistan has not said whether it would test again. U.S.
intelligence sources said they had detected no signs that either
Pakistan or India was readying new tests.
	   The international community has pressured India and Pakistan to
sign a test ban treaty and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed by
both countries.
	   A top Iranian envoy arrived Monday in Pakistan and praised its
government for its nuclear tests.
	   ``From all over the world, Muslims are happy that Pakistan has
this capability,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told
reporters.
	   Kharrazi dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow
Pakistan down the nuclear road.
	   ``We don't have any nuclear weapons program . . . what we have
is for peaceful purposes,'' and all Iran's nuclear facilities are
open to international inspectors, he said.
	   Violence broke out briefly Monday in Srinagar, capital of
Indian-held Kashmir, after 100 people who oppose Indian rule
distributed sweets in the streets _ a traditional way of
celebrating _ and carried banners congratulating Pakistan on its
nuclear tests. Some threw stones at police, who responded by
beating protesters.
	   In Jammu, the nearby winter capital, a small bomb went off in a
crowded market, killing a small child and injuring nine others,
police said.
	   Mobs then burned down a dozen police jeeps and some private
cars, injuring 10 policemen, officials said. The explosion occurred
as campaigning during a local election concluded Monday. No one
claimed responsibility for the blast.
	   Indian accuses Pakistan of arming and training several groups
fighting either for Kashmir's independence or its union with
Pakistan. Pakistan says it lends them only moral support.

	   SOFTWARE Online Sdn Bhd plans to pump in RM10 million in its
latest round of investments to support its involvement in the
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) initiative.
	   Software Online's general manager Hong Fan Chong said the
company is allocating RM5 million to establish its corporate office
and another RM5 million to set up a research and development (RD)
facility in Cyberjaya.
	   He said the RD plant is expected to be ready by the year 2000
and will focus on software development activities that are in line
with local market requirements.
	   According to Hong, the RD investment is the second, after a
recent allocation of RM5 million, which underlines the company's
commitment to its MSC venture.
	   Software Online, which develops specialised software solutions
for the property development industry, was awarded MSC status in
February this year.
	   On the company's financial performance, Hong said Software
Online, which is a member of the IFCA Consulting Group, is
targeting some RM10 million in sales revenue by the end of this
year.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference held in conjunction with a
seminar themed Effects of The Millennium (Year 2000) Bug On The
Property Development Industry in Kuala Lumpur last week.
	   At the event, Software Online unveiled the second version of its
property development information system called D'Developer, which
it claimed is future-proof against potential problems caused by the
Year 2000 (Y2K) or millennium bug problem.
	   ``The property development industry is a very important part of
our economy, and we believe that property developers should be
given every assistance in addressing the Y2K issue,'' said Hong.
	   He said the locally-produced D'Developer which involved an
investment of RM5 million, is capable of supporting companies with
multiple projects and property types.
	   The software functionalities include customer prospecting, sales
tracking, extra packages offering, billing, collection, credit
control, project scheduling, contractor contract and claims,
purchasing, material management, accounts payable, project costing
and corporate accounting.
	   In conjunction with the new release, Software Online, through
its distributor Project Online Sdn Bhd, is offering a promotion
valid until the end of next month. During this period, customers
will be given the software free of charge, and they need only bear
the hardware, networking and Y2K implementation costs. Depending on
the number of users, the cost ranges from RM50,000 to RM200,000.
	   Hong said even though there is a drop in demand for software
products due to the economic crisis, Software Online is still
bullish about its prospects.
	   ``For the new release, we are targeting sales revenue of between
RM4 million and RM5 million this year.''
	   According to Hong, the company plans to expand its market reach
to Africa, South America, United States and Europe.
	   He said Software Online is also looking for more distributors in
countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia,
Papua New Guinea and the US.
	   A member of the IFCA Consulting Group, Software Online
specialises in the development of comprehensive management
information systems for hotels and clubs, real estates developers,
property management companies, financial institutions,
project-based companies, federal and Government projects,
educational institutions and data interchange industries.

Sinn Fein stands up Prince Charles _ saving some British blushes plans in grafs 9-13, edits 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Mowlam defending invitation, detailing government
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In a double-edged snub, leaders
of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party have turned down an invitation to
a royal garden party because Prince Charles will be there.
	   The announcement saved the host, Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam, from some awkward maneuvering, though she
defended the invitation on Monday.
	   Now, she won't have to worry about keeping the Sinn Fein leaders
away from Charles _ whose much-loved great-uncle Lord Mountbatten
was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army in 1979 _ when guests
mingle Wednesday in the grounds of her Hillsborough Castle
residence.
	   Sinn Fein said that leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness
will boycott the party because Charles holds the ceremonial
position of colonel-in-chief of the Parachute Regiment whose
members were involved in the so-called Bloody Sunday killings in
1972. Thirteen Catholic marchers were shot dead in the British
army's worst shooting in this province.
	   After a long campaign by relatives of the victims, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair this year authorized a new investigation into
Bloody Sunday, which is being carried out by an international panel
of judges.
	   Leaders of pro-British Protestant parties accused Mowlam of
blundering and insensitivity by inviting Sinn Fein to the party,
being held to mark the 50th anniversary of the state-funded
National Health Service in Northern Ireland.
	   Before Sinn Fein said it wouldn't be going, Mowlam promised to
make sure Charles didn't meet Adams and McGuinness, who hold two of
the 18 Northern Ireland seats in the 659-member British House of
Commons. Charles' office made no comment.
	   ``I think we've indeed been fortunate that, for wrong and
inexcusable reasons, Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness have declined the
Charles invitation,'' Conservative lawmaker Andrew Mackay said in
the House of Commons in London.
	   Mowlam responded that Sinn Fein was a party to Northern
Ireland's agreement on a new assembly, and that it was normal to
invite all political parties to such events.
	   ``We can't expect people to participate in the assembly together
and then say we judge for ourselves different standards,'' Mowlam
told the House of Commons.
	   Mowlam told lawmakers that both the British and Irish
Governments planned ``very soon'' to introduce bills establishing
decommissioning schemes to encourage paramilitary groups to
relinquish their weaponry, under the terms of Northern Ireland's
April peace accord.
	   ``There will then be no practical barrier to a start to
decommissioning,'' Mowlam said.
	   Mowlam said the British government will also bring in bills to
set up Northern Ireland's new assembly and the planned ministerial
council that will have members from both Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland. Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to fly
to Northern Ireland to meet with the province's political leaders
Tuesday in talks that will focus on the legislation.

British premier says violence in Northern Ireland predictable 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photo MAD106
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair described
the weekend's violence between Protestant marchers and Catholic
protesters in Northern Ireland as ``not wholly surprising if
regrettable,'' at the end of a flying visit to Madrid on Monday.
	   Blair said that the violence, the worst since the Northern Irish
peace agreement was reached on April 10, was instigated by people
who ``belong to the past.''
	   ``The result of the referendum (in favor of the peace accord)
showed that the overwhelming majority of people want to conduct
debate by democratic and nonviolent means'' he added.
	   The Labor Party prime minister made his comments during a joint
press conference with his Spanish counterpart Jose Maria Aznar, of
the center-right Popular Party.
	   Blair was due in Dublin later Monday in this latest stage of a
round-Europe tour to prepare for the Cardiff summit later this
month that will wind up the British term in the rotating presidency
of the European Union.
	   The Spanish and British prime ministers also confirmed plans to
hold annual bilateral summits.
	   Blair said his ``excellent'' relationship with Aznar, despite
their origins ``at opposite ends of the political spectrum,'' was
due to the dwindling importance of the ideological divide between
left and right as well as their relative youth.
	   He stressed a meeting of minds ``on the principles of how we
make our people more employable,'' underlining the need for
competitiveness and adaptability of the workforce.

	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Teun de Nooijer scored a golden goal
two minutes from an imminent penalty shootout to secure the men's
field hockey World Cup for Olympic champion Netherlands in
sudden-death overtime Monday.
	   Cheered by thousands of frenzied home fans, De Noojier's goal in
the 13th minute of extra time helped the Netherlands beat Spain 3-2
to win the World Cup for the third time in the tournament's 27-year
history.
	   Spain, losing finalist in the inaugural 1971 World Cup, was
again left holding the runner-up trophy on its second trip into the
final.
	   It was the second time in two years that Holland shattered the
Spanish men's hopes of winning their first major title. The
Netherlands beat Spain 3-1 in the title clash at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
	   Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans said he loved golden goals, even
more so after winning the title with a rasping shot from De
Nooijer.
	   ``I love the golden goal. It's a great rule,'' he said after the
victory.
	   Spain showed its resolve to turn the tables this time by closely
marking the Dutch raiders and surging into the lead against the run
of play in the 18th minute through a flash strike by left winger
Javier Arnau.
	   The Spanish defense was under pressure from the Dutch raiders
when a counter attack on the first Netherlands penalty corner saw
Victor Pujol relay Juan Escarre's long pass to Arnau, who scored
with a stinging angular shot past goalkeeper Ronald Jansen.
	   Spain suffered a big blow in the 21st minute when its
center-forward Escarre limped out of the field with a pulled
hamstring, but its goalkeeper Jufresa played a brilliant game to
thwart a series of raids on the citadel.
	   Jufresa twice came between Dutch strikers and the Spain goal as
he padded away stinging shots from Jeroen Delmee and Jaap Derk
Buma.
	   Marking the Netherlands' raiders exceptionally well, Spain
seemed in control of the game when a penalty corner conversion by
Victor Pujol increased the lead in the 54th minute by deflecting
Arnau's shot past the bewildered goalkeeper.
	   Dutch captain Stephan Veen brought his team back into the game
with a 54th minute strike after dribbling into the scoring zone
past two defenders on the right flank and shooting into the far
corner of the goal.
	   Going all out into the attack, Netherlands forced a series of
penalty corners. But the Spanish defense held its ground until drag
flick specialist Bram Lomans scooped the ball into the cage in the
61st minute to make the equalizer and take the game into extra
time.
	   De Nooijer slammed a penalty corner rebound into the goal to set
of celebrations among the boisterous 15,000 capacity crowd after
goalkeeper Jufresa had blocked the shot from Lomans with just two
minutes of extra time remaining.
	   Spanish coach Toni Forrelat said his players gave away easy
penalty corners towards the end.
	   ``The better team won but we had a chance to score our third
goal, which would have finished the Netherlands,'' he said. ``It
was great to try and beat the Dutch in Netherlands but we ran out
of oxygen in extra time and were very tired.
	   ``My team had not practiced strokes before or during the
tournament so we were not playing for penalties.''
	   Roelants, the Dutch coach, said the goal from Veen was the
turning point for Netherlands.
	   ``I though it was all over when we went down 2-0,'' he said.
``The goal from Veen was very important and so was the crowd
support which lifted us.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Some 32,000 new cancer cases are reported
every year in Malaysia, making it the number two killer after road
accidents.
	   National Cancer Foundation president Datuk Mohd Farid Ariffin
said most cancer deaths among men were due to lung cancer and
women, breast cancer.
	   ``This figure is increasing because of the people's unhealthy
lifestyle,''
	   he said, adding that smokers should give up the bad habit while
women should go for regular screening. ``Men who smoke heavily are
known to have a low sperm count while women smokers have small
babies.''
	   Farid said this after a Press conference on a charity film
premiere which will be held on June 14 to raise RM70,000 to set up
a cancer institute.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Deputy MCA president Datuk Lim Ah Lek today
praised MCA Youth for its pragmatic approach in taking up issues
directly with the relevant authorities to resolve problems.
	   ``This is not only very constructive but also an acceptable
manner to overcome issues faced by the movement,'' he added.
	   Lim, who is also the Human Resources Minister also praised its
leadership for the proactive stance in response to the economic
problems.
	   Delivering his keynote address at the movement's 35th annual
general assembly at the Tunku Abdul Rahman College, he said: ``The
movement's initiative in promoting the Love Malaysia, Buy Local
Products and other patriotic campaigns have enhanced the confidence
of people in facing the current economic downturn.''
	   Also present were Umno Youth head Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi,
youth leaders of Barisan Nasional component parties, former MCA
Youth heads -Datuk Kee Yong Wee, Chew Hock Thye and Datuk Yap Pian
Hon, who is also an MCA vice-president.
	   Lim hoped that the movement would continue with its practical
political struggle and further enhance its image as a contributor
to the community and country.
	   ``Only through such `leadership by example' will the party earn
the trust and support of the Chinese community and the Barisan
Nasional Government,''
	   he said.
	   He also urged the movement to go on an aggressive recruitment
drive to get more youths to join the party.
	   ``Intensive political training must be provided so that they
will be equipped to serve the party and nation. We need both
quality and quantity in the party,'' he added.
	   On the party elections next year, he said: ``There should be
minimal contests for top positions in the movement.
	   ``However, under the democratic process, members have been given
the mandate to retain those who have performed well and to remove
those who have not.''
	   Lim also reminded members that the party was free from
factionalism and unity was prevalent and this could be attributed
to the leadership of the president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik.
	   ``Political stability in the party has allowed the top
leadership to launch several large projects for the community and
the country,'' he added.
	   MCA Youth chief Datuk Chan Kong Choy in his speech called for
closer co- operation among the various races.
	   ``Our forefathers have laid this strong foundation of
co-operation, unity and solidarity and this has been further
strengthened by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim when
he said `we are one family','' he said.
	   Chan, who is also the Deputy Minister of Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts, added that the spirit of co-operation
among the various races should be strengthened as we faced the
current economic problems.
	   Towards this end, Malaysians must rally and support the
country's leaders in a true spirit of `one family' to tackle the
problems.

	   MALAYSIA is pushing ahead with plans under a national blueprint
launched late last year to develop its aerospace industry, despite
the economic weather now.
	   Nearly half a year after it announced the establishment of the
Malaysian Aerospace Council, the Malaysian Industry-Government
Group for High Technology (Might) last weekend disclosed to
Business Times the proposed structure of the country's aerospace
industry, as contained in the Blueprint for the Aerospace Industry
in Malaysia.
	   The setting up of the council was seen as a first step towards
implementing the 45-point blueprint, which was launched by Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad last year, but little else
of the document or the council has been reported since.
	   Might said members to sit on the council, which Dr Mahathir will
chair, are in the process of being identified.
	   According to the blueprint, the council will be aided by the a
National Aerospace Coordinating Body. The Department of Civil
Aviation (DCA) will take on added tasks and will be known as the
Malaysian Aviation Authority.
	   The establishment of the council, the coordinating body and the
authority as an integral part of the national aerospace industry
structure comes under the Framework for Aerospace Industry in
Malaysia, which is one of the 45 recommendations contained in the
blueprint.
	   ``The council will further the development of the aerospace
industry by making key decisions in the areas of priorities and
strategies,'' said the blueprint.
	   Might will serve as the secretariat of the council to ensure a
private sector-led consultative platform. It will also manage the
National Aerospace Coordinating Body, which will act as a reference
point for the various aerospace initiatives, activities and
investments.
	   The coordinating body will consolidate the current initiatives
in the aerospace sector and further spearhead Malaysia's
involvement in the industry. Its main functions will be to provide
a reference point for the management of offset programmes, act as
an intermediate for local and foreign interests in the aerospace
industry, establish a detailed inventory of local aerospace players
and regulate the key players.
	   Under the proposed structure, five major groups of civil and
military operators - Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airports Bhd,
Defence/Security Forces, general aviation companies, and other
companies - will play a major role in the industry.
	   There will also be an aerospace intelligence unit ``parked''
under the National Aerospace Coordinating Body, which will monitor
critical and strategic international developments in aerospace and
aviation.
	   At the same time, the blueprint said the proposed Malaysia
Aviation Authority - modelled along the lines of the Civil Aviation
Authority in the UK - will take over the role of the DCA.
	   The Malaysia Aviation Authority will ensure adequate regulatory
and strategic support for the development of the local aerospace
industry.
	   It would be an autonomous body, managed by a board comprising
members from the industry and government.
	   ``The Malaysia Aviation Authority will not only regulate but
lead and support the changing demands of the aerospace industry
instead of only fulfilling its traditional function of serving the
aviation industry,'' the blueprint said.
	   Might said Malaysia possesses the basic ingredients for
achieving a competitive advantage in the aerospace industry but it
needs to ``urgently restructure and enhance its competencies to
excel in the aerospace industry.''

	   TELUK INTAN, Sun. - Anyone who possesses the commitment and
capability to ensure continuity in Wanita Umno's struggle can lead
the movement, said its chief Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman.
	   The movement had no intention of imposing a no-contest rule for
the chief post in next year's elections.
	   ``I am ready to be challenged but whoever is seeking election to
the post must ensure continuity in the movement's struggle,'' she
said yesterday.
	   Siti Zaharah hoped delegates at the coming general assembly
would not pass a resolution calling for no-contest for the post.
	   She said the movement had embarked on a programme to encourage
members to diversify economic activities to help improve the
country's economic health.
	   These included encouraging savings in Amanah Saham Wanita and
involvement in co-operatives, and conducting courses on
agriculture-based processing.
	   She said the assistance of two ministries and the Malaysian
Agricultural Research Development Institute had been sought to
realise the programme.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The number of Wanita MCA members holding
the post of local councillors has increased by 81 per cent.
	   MCA secretary-general Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said today 49
Wanita members had been appointed as councillors in district and
municipal councils nationwide to date.
	   There were only 27 Wanita councillors last year although 447
positions were allocated for the MCA.
	   This changed when the MCA presidential council decided last year
to allow Wanita members to take up 15 per cent of the MCA posts for
municipal and district councillors by 1999 and 30 per cent by the
year 2005.
	   Speaking to reporters after opening the Wanita MCA 23rd annual
general assembly at Wisma MCA, Ting said the aim was to give women
a bigger role in the party.
	   ``The leadership is satisfied with the Wanita members'
performance but we feel their participation in the party can be
increased.
	   ``As such, we want more Wanita members as delegates at the
annual general assembly,'' he said.
	   The 45th MCA general assembly tomorrow is expected to pass an
amendment to the party's constitution to increase the number of
Wanita MCA delegates to the general assembly.
	   The amendment is to enable every division to select at least one
Wanita delegate for the assembly. Currently, there are only 175
Wanita representatives out of the 2,502 delegates.
	   ``We expect the number will be more than 200 after the
amendment,'' said Ting.
	   Earlier in his speech, Ting urged Wanita MCA to organise
programmes to uncover potential future leaders.
	   This would ensure the party continued to have leaders of
calibre.
	   It was also important for a party to have many members and
branches.
	   Wanita MCA now has 1,415 branches and 250,000 members. The
target is 500,000 members by 2000.
	   Wanita head Datuk Teng Gaik Kwan said women had to widen their
knowledge and become involved in politics so that they could play a
role in policy- making and nation-building.
	   ``As we are entering a new era, we have to project a new image
and must have the ability. This is so that we are given the
confidence to participate in policy-making which is currently
monopolised by men,'' she said.
	   There were 23 resolutions presented for debate at the general
assembly.
	   They include children's, social, education and economic issues.
	   The resolutions included: Urging MCA to field more Wanita
candidates in the next parliamentary and State elections.
	   Urging the Government to severely punish agents who bring in
illegal foreign workers and those who rape children below 12 years
of age.
	   Urging the Government to set up a children's affairs division
under the National Unity and Social Development Ministry to address
social problems.
	   Urging the police and relevant authorities to take a serious
view of gangsterism in schools.
	   Urging the Education Ministry to review the criteria for
admission of students into local universities to ensure those with
excellent results get a place.
	   Supporting the Government in its policy to control inflation.
	   Supporting the ministries of Housing and Local Government and
Environment in the move to punish polluters.
	   The assembly was attended by 491 delegates.

	   THE US economy grew at 4.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1998
in spite of signs that Asia s economic troubles were slowing
exports. In addition both consumer spending and income increased by
0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively for the month of April
1998.
	   Meanwhile US imports surged by US$48 billion (US$1    RM3.89) in
the
first quarter of 1998 more than triple the $14.7 billion increase
in the last quarter of 1997 while exports dropped by $7.7 billion
for the first quarter of 1998.	   Federal policy makers have said that US economic growth must
soon moderate to a rate close to 2.25 per cent annual growth in
order to forestall monetary tightening.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The MCA Youth today urged the Employees'
Provident Fund to ensure that it can generate reasonable returns
through cautious, prudent and transparent handling of its various
investments.
	   It also pledged to heed the call of the National Economic Action
Council to the people to buy local products, enhancing food
production, encouraging domestic tourism, saving with local banks
and embarking on austerity drive.
	   This is to avert the outflow of the country's foreign exchange
reserves to help the nation tide over the prevailing economic
downturn.
	   These were among the resolutions adopted at its 35th general
assembly.
	   The others included: To support the Government by not allowing
any privatised project or concession from being transferred to stem
profiteering. It said that in any selection of concessionaires for
such projects, the Government should ensure that only those with
sufficient expertise, capital and management ability be given due
consideration.
	   To support the Government in intensifying the coastal patrol to
stem the influx of illegal immigrants, and to urge the people to
provide the authorities with relevant information to enable the
latter to send back the aliens; To fully support the party
leadership in launching the various information technology projects
catered to the needs of the IT era, through the implementation of
paperless administration, electronic mailing and video
conferencing; To urge the Education Ministry to tighthen the
supervision of private institutions of higher learning to ensure
that their advertisements and the standard of teaching adhere to
regulations; and, To urge the Works Ministry and respective State
Governments to view seriously the prevailing water crisis and to
address the problem comprehensively in the national perspective.
	   During the debate, Malacca representative Leong Chiew Chong
expressed dissatisfaction with the Education Ministry in allowing
only pupils whose parents were earning below RM1,000 to secure book
aid under the school textbook loan scheme.
	   ``Earning RM1,000 is no longer a big income, especially when one
is employed in big cities.''
	   Pahang representative Chim Siew Wai questioned the rationale of
the party's leadership in wanting 30 per cent of its Wanita members
to be the party's representatives in local councils by the year
2000.
	   ``Why are we implementing such a policy when all this while we
were fighting the quota system,'' he said.
	   Kelantan representative Yap Hock Onn said the packaging aspect
of local goods should be made more attractive and presentable if
the Buy Malaysian campaign were to be a success.
	   ``Unless we improve the packaging of Made-in-Malaysia products,
I am afraid we will not be able to attract customers.
	   ``I observed that even goods manufactured by the Thai cottage
industry near the Kelantan border, are far ahead in terms of
presentation compared to ours,'' he added.

	   HONG Kong stocks will endure another unpredictable week as
concern mounts over the state of the local economy and Asia's
financial outlook, dealers said.
	   Mr Alex Tang, research head at Core-Pacific Yamaichi Securities,
said the direction of the market will hinge on reaction to the
announcement after trading closed on Friday that Hong Kong's gross
domestic product (GDP) slumped 2.0 per cent in the quarter to
March, the first decline in 13 years.
	   The key Hang Seng index shed 621.42 points or 6.5 per cent to
close the week's trading at 8,934.56 on Friday, after gaining a
mere 0.2 per cent the previous week.
	   The average daily turnover amounted to HK$6.34 billion, against
the previous week's HK$6.719 billion.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Against the background of the present
economic slowdown, Esso Malaysia Bhd is offering a reduction of
three sen per litre in the prices of both regular and unleaded Esso
Xtreme petrol from today until June 14.
	   The promotion will be in all Esso service stations in Malaysia.
	   Esso chairman and chief executive officer Datuk Philip Dingle
said in a statement today the promotion was mooted as ``all
Malaysians deserve an immediate benefit by getting reduced petrol
prices''.
	   ``In these difficult times, all Malaysian drivers need a
break,'' he said.
	   He said the public responded strongly to Esso Xtreme fuel as
well as to purchasing in Esso's convenient stores, Tiger Marts.
	   ``We want to continue to support our customers by not only
giving them the best quality products and services, but an extra
bonus of cheaper petrol.''
	   He said Esso wanted to do something positive for its consumers
by reducing the prices although many neighbouring countries have
been required to raise fuel prices at these times.

	   SHARE prices are expected to remain under pressure this week as
regional economic concerns weigh on the market, dealers said last
Friday.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials index of the Stock
Exchange of Singapore fell 58.74 points or 4.5 per cent to close
the week at 1,254.93 last Friday.
	   ``The market will remain under pressure amid fears that more
depressing economic numbers will emerge in the region,'' a dealer
with a local stock brokerage said.
	   Average daily turnover fell to 94.01 million shares worth
S$168.23 million from 202.53 million shares valued at S$318.50
million the previous week.
	   The hottest stock for the week was Singapore Telecommunications
Ltd, with 32.09 million shares traded.
	   The top gainer was Singapore Technology Industrial Corp, rising
13 cents to S$1.66 while the biggest loser was Creative Technology
Ltd, falling S$3.00 to S$30.50.

	   INDONESIAN President Habibie has been in office for slightly
more than a week and he seems to have the situation under control.
	   Aside from the small groups, opposition seeking reforms, poll
date and other minor problems, life in Indonesia is back to normal.
The fact that large numbers of Indonesians, led by ethnic Chinese
have returned bear witness that life is slowly returning to normal.
	   The long orderly queue to withdraw money from the biggest
private bank is a contrast to the rioting mob prior to the stepping
down of President Suharto.
	   Habibie seems to have appeased the anger of the students and
have gained the support of the armed forces. This will go a long
way to help him get down to resolving the economic problems now
facing Indonesia. Stability in Indonesia will also bring stability
to its neighbours.
	   The treasury announced early last week of the possibility of a
surplus in its current account this year.
	   Critics have come out to say that this has been achieved through
the drastic cut back in the importation of goods and not through
the more positive action of more exports.
	   We feel that this is uncalled for, as the whole world knows that
we are experiencing an economic slowdown. Common sense tells us
that we should cut down on unnecessary import items, which are not
productive.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was traded easier for the full
five days of trading last week. Although the local bourse did make
an attempt to rally on Thursday and Friday, it was put down by
concern in the weak ringgit and warning that our economy would move
into recession if banks continue to be extra strict in their
lending policy.
	   Fears that the Hong Kong economy may slip into recession, the
weak yen and high interest rates all added to the woes of a market
that was already weak. The Dow falling to below its 9,000 point
level is another factor that contributed to the overall weak
market.
	   In the midst of these, a market observer has noted that trading
volume has been extremely low. The first three days of trading
chalked up less than a hundred million shares each day, while
Thursday and Friday just managed to move above the one hundred
million mark.
	   On the technical front, our rising Timing Device turned down
last Tuesday. The falling pace gained momentum on Wednesday and
Thursday but started to slow down on Friday.
	   We feel that the slowdown in falling pace will continue early
this week and a reversal trend is possible at the -200.0 point
level by mid-week, failing the next support level at the -400.0
point level.
	   Our O/O Indicator continues to trend up but at a slower space.
Our projection study has indicated a continuation of this uptrend.
Another slowdown of the uptrend pace can mean we are slowly working
towards a reversal in trend. An increase in its uptrend pace can
act as a catalyst for further advancement. The current low volume
favours a steadier market this week.

Safin ends surprising run with loss to Pioline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Pioline defeating Safin; TRIMS.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marat Safin, the Russian qualifier who made a
stunning run to the fourth round of the French Open, lost a tough
five-setter Monday to Cedric Pioline of France, 7-5, 4-6, 6-7
(5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   The crowd chanted wildly for Pioline throughout the match, but
by the end, they were chanting as well for Safin, the world's
116th-ranked player who beat Agassi and defending champ Gustavo
Kuerten here.
	   At only 18, Safin is a decade younger than Pioline, who was a
runner-up at last year's Wimbledon.
	   Pioline will next meet Hicham Arazi of Morocco, who also
advanced Monday.
	   The American men may have bombed out at this year's French Open,
but the women are doing just fine.
	   With Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles all
advancing Sunday, more U.S. women have reached the quarterfinals
than in any French Open since 1986.
	   They were almost joined by the other Williams sister, Serena.
But she folded in the second set of a contentious match against
Aranxta Sanchez Vicario after coming within two points of victory.
	   ``I'm only 16, my first Roland Garros,'' Serena said after the
match. ``Everything is a learning experience for me.''
	   That may be the one thing Sanchez Vicario agreed with.
	   ``I taught her a lesson,'' the fourth-seeded Spaniard said
angrily after the match.
	   It was a lesson that featured glares across the net, an unusual
dress change by the Spaniard, and a slam by Williams that nearly
beheaded her opponent.
	   Williams accused Sanchez Vicario of changing from a black outfit
to a white one midway through the second set as a strategic move.
Sanchez Vicario, for her part, was upset at Williams' attitude
after a controversial point in the first set.
	   ``I just think she doesn't have respect. She cannot go in with
that attitude,'' said Sanchez Vicario. ``You know, I'm glad I beat
her.''
	   So Serena will have to watch her sister in the quarters, and it
should be one of the most intriguing matches of the tournament.
	   Venus Williams will play top-seeded Martina Hingis, another
match in a rivalry quickly becoming one of the best in women's
sports.
	   The older Williams advanced Sunday with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia in which she slammed seven aces _ two
at 116 mph.
	   Hingis was a 6-1, 6-2 winner over Anna Smashnova of Israel in a
match between former French Open junior champions.
	   Venus Williams, the No. 8 seed, has lost just 13 games in her
four matches at the French Open. Hingis has lost 14 games.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, but they are 2-2
this year.
	   Sanchez Vicario will face Patty Schnyder in the quarterfinals.
No. 2 Davenport and No. 6 Seles also advanced to the quarters.
	   Davenport will face defending champion Iva Majoli, the 10th
seed, who ousted No. 7 Conchita Martinez 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (3-7), 6-3
in a match completed Monday.
	   Majoli and Martinez were tied at a set apiece when darkness
halted play Sunday night. Martinez jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead
in the third set, then lost the last five games.
	   Seles will face No. 3 Jana Novotna, who defeated No. 13 Anna
Kournikova 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-3 in another match halted Sunday
night. The match was stopped with Novotna leading 4-2 in the final
set. It took Novotna just 12 minutes to finish off the match
Monday.
	   Play was halted Sunday night at Novotna's request, which left
Kournikova in tears because she had made the same request a game
earlier, but was denied.
	   According to international tennis rules, a match can be halted
due to darkness only on an even-number game in a set.
	   ``It was very difficult for me to play the match over two
days,'' Kournikova said. ``It was a new experience for me.''
	   Seles, a three-time champion who never has lost before the
quarterfinals in Paris, won 6-1, 6-4 over Chanda Rubin.

	   IPOH, Sun. - Cuepacs has received the green light from the
Public Service Department to conduct a random survey on the New
Remuneration System for civil servants to gauge its effectiveness
and acceptance. The NRS, in its sixth year of implementation, has
been the subject of many complaints from civil servants.
	   Cuepacs secretary-general S. Siva Subramaniam said today:
``Questionnaires would be distributed to members of affiliated
bodies in a month.''
	   He said the survey was expected to be completed in one month and
its findings submitted to the PSD by the end of August.
	   Siva Subramaniam said Cuepacs hoped the survey could help
improve weaknesses in the NRS.
	   ``We found the matrix system not properly implemented but we
also have civil servants who approve of the system. That is why we
need to conduct a survey on the NRS,'' he said after attending the
opening of the Perak Cuepacs delegates' meeting.
	   Under the NRS, every employee has to be assessed annually, first
by his immediate superior and then by the head of his department on
his performance and points are given for each aspect of the
assessment.
	   The NRS is designed to get the best out of government servants
by rewarding them with salary increases based on performance. The
performance of civil servants is then classified into one of four
categories -unsatisfactory, satisfactory, very good and excellent
performance.
	   The unsatisfactory performer gets no salary increase for that
year; the satisfactory performer, a salary increase on the same
level; the very good performer, a salary increase of 1 1/2
increment and moved to the next level, and the excellent performer,
a double increment and moved to the next level.

	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Teun de Nooijer scored a golden goal
two minutes from an imminent penalty shootout to secure the men's
field hockey World Cup for Olympic champion Netherlands in
sudden-death overtime Monday.
	   Cheered by thousands of frenzied home fans, De Noojier's goal in
the 13th minute of extra time helped the Netherlands beat Spain 3-2
to win the World Cup for the third time in the tournament's 27-year
history.
	   Spain, losing finalist in the inaugural 1971 World Cup, was
again left holding the runner-up trophy on its second trip to the
final.
	   It was the second time in two years that Holland shattered the
Spanish men's hopes of winning their first major title. The
Netherlands beat Spain 3-1 for the gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
	   Spain showed its resolve to turn the tables this time by closely
marking the Dutch raiders and surging into the lead against the run
of play in the 18th minute through a flash strike by left winger
Javier Arnau.
	   The Spanish defense was under pressure from the Dutch raiders
when a counter attack on the first Netherlands penalty corner saw
Victor Pujol relay Juan Escarre's long pass to Arnau, who scored
with a stinging angular shot past goalkeeper Ronald Jansen.
	   Spain suffered a big blow in the 21st minute when its
center-forward Escarre limped out of the field with a pulled
hamstring, but its goalkeeper Jufresa played a brilliant game to
thwart a series of raids on the citadel.
	   Jufresa twice came between Dutch strikers and the Spain goal as
he padded away stinging shots from Jeroen Delmee and Jaap Derk
Buma.
	   Marking the Netherlands' raiders exceptionally well, Spain
seemed in control of the game when a penalty corner conversion by
Victor Pujol increased the lead in the 54th minute by deflecting
Arnau's shot past the bewildered goalkeeper.
	   Dutch captain Stephan Veen brought his team back into the game
with a 54th minute strike after dribbling into the scoring zone
past two defenders on the right flank and shooting into the far
corner of the goal.
	   Going all out into the attack, Netherlands forced a series of
penalty corners. But the Spanish defense held its ground until drag
flick specialist Bram Lomans scooped the ball into the cage in the
61st minute to make the equalizer and take the game into extra
time.
	   De Nooijer slammed a penalty corner rebound into the goal to set
off celebrations among the boisterous 15,000 capacity crowd after
goalkeeper Jufresa had blocked the shot from Lomans with just two
minutes of extra time remaining.
	   Spanish coach Toni Forrelat said his players gave away easy
penalty corners towards the end.
	   ``The better team won but we had a chance to score our third
goal, which would have finished the Netherlands,'' he said. ``It
was great to try and beat the Dutch in Netherlands but we ran out
of oxygen in extra time and were very tired.
	   ``My team had not practiced strokes before or during the
tournament so we were not playing for penalties.''
	   Roelants, the Dutch coach, said the goal from Veen was the
turning point for Netherlands.
	   ``I though it was all over when we went down 2-0,'' he said.
``The goal from Veen was very important and so was the crowd
support which lifted us.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In normal times, an Air France strike would merely
cause havoc.
	   But the walkout by the carrier's pilots Monday was worse: a deep
embarrassment for a country preparing to host in just nine days the
world's biggest sporting event, the World Cup.
	   Despite pressure from leftist government ministers, most of the
state-run carrier's 3,200 pilots stayed out of their cockpits to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
They are threatening to stay out for two weeks or more.
	   That's well into the World Cup, which begins June 10 and lasts a
month. On just the first day Monday, 100,000 passengers were sent
scrambling.
	   And it could be only the beginning: French train workers were
planning to strike at the end of the week.
	   Desperate travelers lined ticket counters at Paris airports
Monday, while the Air France planes they were supposed to take,
many colorfully painted with soccer players for the championship,
sat idle.
	   Departure screens offered a bleak sight: they alternately
flashed ``annule'' and ``canceled'' in bright red.
	   After a day of strikes, Air France announced a meeting with the
pilots' union on Tuesday afternoon -- the first since failed 11th
hour talks last Thursday.
	   ``Finally, it seems like a real wish for dialogue,'' said the
spokesman for the pilots union, Christian Paris.
	   ``I hope, I believe, these negotiations will bring us a solution
to this conflict,'' Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta said
on French television Monday night.
	   But gave no hint the company was ready to withdraw a
controversial plan to cut pilots' salaries in exchange for shares
in Air France.
	   An ``economic effort'' must be made by all ``if Air France wants
to become one of the very big world airlines,'' Spinetta said.

	   THE local stock market continued with its downward trend last
week, a situation that is most likely to persist well into this
week's trade, according to analysts.
	   With no positive local and foreign developments that could spur
the market, stocks were traded mostly lower throughout the week. As
one analyst put it aptly: ``No matter where you turn, there were
worries everywhere.''
	   Leading the worries is the anticipated low corporate earnings to
be announced this week. Last Friday, national carrier Malaysian
Airline System Bhd announced a pre-tax loss of RM225.38 million for
the financial year ended March 31 1998.
	   Then, there are the growing concerns over the country's state of
economy. Malaysia's gross domestic product figure for the first
quarter of this year is expected to be announced and already
analysts have given their lower-than-expected forecasts.
	   Adding to the weak sentiment last week was the statement made by
Tun Daim Zainuddin that Malaysia must avoid stagflation - slow
growth with high interest rates.
	   Daim has said last Wednesday that if Malaysian banks continue to
be unnecessarily strict in their lending, stagnant growth can be
expected.
	   On the foreign front, taking the cue from the sharp fall of the
Dow Jones last Wednesday and coupled with continued concerns over
the region's economies, share prices across the region fell hard.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was the hardest hit as it nosedived
5.3 per cent or 498.78 points to below the psychological level at
8,983.43 on economic jitters. It was reported that Hong Kong chief
executive Tung Chee-hwa said the territory might post negative
growth as the economy was in a major adjustment.
	   Besides worries that Hong Kong might go into recession, the
sluggish Japan's economy and the yen depreciation against the US
dollar contributed to the lethargic sentiment over the local
bourse.
	   The yen depreciation, said anaylsts could spark US investors to
dump Japanese and other international stocks, which in turn would
affect all Asian markets.
	   Meanwhile, the political uncertainty surrounding Indonesia is
far from over and this will further dampen sentiment across the
region.
	   Back at home, sellers, led by foreign funds swarmed the local
bourse, selling down most blue-chip stocks such as Maybank,
Telekom, Tenaga Nasional and Sime Darby.
	   The week began last Monday with the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
Composite Index (KLCI) finishing 6.68 points lower to close at
570.55. The next day, it fell again by 9.27 points to 561.28.
	   On Wednesday, as concerns on the economy grew, investors dumped
heavyweight stocks, dragging the KLCI 9 points down to close at
552.28.
	   Last Thursday saw a mild technical rebound in the early parts of
the day but was later absorbed by profit-taking with the KLCI
shedding 7.54 points to close at 544.74. Finally on Friday, selling
pressure continued prompting the KLCI to close 6.5 points lower to
538.24.
	   Overall, the KLCI lost about 38.99 points or 6.76 per cent from
the previous Friday's closing of 577.23, while the Emas Index shed
8.41 points or 5.8 per cent to 136.51.
	   In terms of volume turnover, last week saw a total of some
499.270 million shares traded valued at RM1.068 billion compared to
754.54 million shares worth RM1.550 billion the week before.
	   Main board turnover was 445.993 million shares valued at
RM993.515 million while second board saw a total of 44.195 million
shares dealt valued at RM69.517 million.
	   Off market turnover saw some 29.302 million shares done worth
RM102.420 million compared to 74.759 million shares valued at
RM161.183 million shares dealt the week before.
	   Making its debut on the main board last week was Mieco Chipboard
Bhd which was not spared from last week's bearish sentiment when it
debuted at RM1.20 over its over price of RM1.50. The stock of the
particleboard maker ended the day one sen lower at RM1.49 with
about 1.2 million shares traded.

	   FORMER Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib was
acquitted yesterday on two charges of falsely declaring the money
he took into Australia in December 1996 and failing to declare more
than A$1.2 million (RM2.9 million) when he left the country.
	   District Court Judge Eric Pratt freed Muhammad after the 12-man
jury, which deliberated for almost five hours, returned a unanimous
verdict of not guilty. Pratt said he would not entertain any
reference on law by the prosecution when Crown Counsel Cate Holmes
said she might make a reference later.
	   ``You can do so before another judge,'' Pratt said, referring to
his earlier ruling on mens rea (guilty mind) which the prosecution
had to establish.
	   When court was adjourned, Muhammad said ``syukur alhamdullilah''
(thank God), rushed out of the dock, hugged his wife Puan Sri Asbi
Rohani Hasnan, his brothers and his counsel. More than 20 of his
supporters in the public gallery above the court room, hurried down
to meet him.
	   There were sounds of relief and cries of joy when the head juror
announced the verdict.
	   With the acquittal, the money involved would be returned to
Muhammad.
	   Counsel Tim Robertson said the defence received a letter from
the prosecution in the morning stating that the money would be
released before the verdict since it was not tainted.
	   Muhammad, 52, who resigned as Menteri Besar in April last year,
was charged with two counts of falsely declaring the amount of
money he was taking into Australia on Dec 16, 1996 and failing to
declare more than A$1.2 million when he left the country on Dec 22,
1996.
	   The charges were under the Australian Financial Transactions
Report Act 1988. Under the Act, all transfer of any currency into
or out of Australia in excess of A$5,000 (the limit was raised to
A$10,000 last June) must be declared to the Australian Customs.
	   Earlier, in his summing up, Pratt outlined the salient points in
the defence and prosecution's evidence, and reminded the jury to
return a unanimous verdict, one way or the other.
	   (A unanimous verdict is required for federal offences such as
those faced by Muhammad.) Muhammad, a Malaysian, should be judged
in the light of his cultural background, the judge said, referring
to Malaysians' preference to deal in cash.
	   Pratt said there was no dispute that most of the elements of the
charges were proved, but what was in dispute was Muhammad's
intention.
	   The judge said the jury should ascertain whether Muhammad had a
guilty mind (mens rea) when he failed to declare the money.
	   (The issue of mens rea was raised by the defence and Pratt had
ruled that it had to be established before Muhammad could be guilty
of the offences.) Pratt said it was rather unfair for the police
not to show Muhammad the declaration form which he filled up on Dec
16, 1996.
	   It would have been better if the form was shown to him during
the interview so that he could explain himself, the judge said,
adding that Muhammad was rather surprised when told that he had
only declared A$9,793.

Rugova calls for greater UN role, independence for Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The leader of the self-declared government
of the Kosovo Albanians sought U.N. support Monday for an
international civilian administration for the troubled province as
a first step toward independence from Serbia.
	   Dr. Ibrahim Rugova met Monday with Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
one day after the United Nations recorded a record number of people
fleeing from Kosovo across the Albanian border to escape fighting
which erupted in the Serb-ruled province over the weekend.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said 1,300 people arrived at the
Albanian border town of Tropoja on Sunday, the largest number in a
single day. Eckhard said an undetermined number of others were
believed trapped by the fighting and unable to cross the border.
	   ``The independence of Kosovo is the best solution,'' Rugova said
after meeting Annan. Rugova said independence for Kosovo, which has
a 90 percent majority Albanian population, would help stabilize the
Balkans, ``even Serbia, although at this stage they think in a
different way.''
	   Serbia rejects independence, considering Kosovo the cradle of
Serb culture. The United States and other major countries also
oppose independence but have called for self-rule for the Kosovo
Albanians within Serbian borders.
	   But Rugova suggested ``some kind of international civilian
administration, or a protectorate, as an interim measure'' leading
to full independence.
	   In the meantime, he called for an end to Serb military and
police operations against Albanian separatists who have been
fighting for independence for the Albanian-majority region, which
is now a province of Serbia. Serbia, together with Montenegro,
forms Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova met in Washington last week with President Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to discuss the crisis in
Kosovo. Rugova applauded U.S. mediation to promote a dialogue
between the Kosovo Albanians and President Slobodan Milosevic.
Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
	   ``In order for the negotiations to be successful, it is critical
that police and military operations stop,'' Rugova said. ``Serb
police and military actions have been continuing, resulting in many
people killed.''
	   He said he asked Annan for ``more support for Kosovo'' and
unspecified ``preventive measures'' to prevent further
deterioration and ``massacres and massive ethnic cleansing.''

	   MALAYSIAN Oxygen Bhd (MOX) reported a 5.6 per cent lower group
pre-tax profit of RM40.15 million for the six months ended March 31
1998 compared with RM42.52 million in the previous corresponding
period.
	   This was achieved on a RM193.66 million turnover, marginally
lower than the RM194.66 million previously.
	   MOX said the Government's revised gross domestic product growth
together with measures taken to stabilise and revive the economy
will continue to have an impact on current trading conditions.
	   It anticipates that demand from the petrochemical, oleochemical
and electronic sectors will continue to grow while that of
metalworks is expected to level off with the slowdown in the
construction industry.
	   Earnings per MOX share during the period stood at 26.6 sen
against 25.6 sen previously.
	   Directors have declared a first gross interim dividend of 8.1
sen, to be paid to shareholders on July 3 1998.

	   PENANG, Sun. - The DAP yesterday called for Parliament to
convene an emergency meeting to debate the negative gross domestic
product growth of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
	   Its secretary-general Lim Kit Siang also called on the National
Economic Action Council to justify its failure in effecting
economic recovery and for not preparing Malaysians for the prospect
of a GDP contraction.
	   ``The worst fears about the Malaysian economic crisis have now
been confirmed,'' Lim said.
	   He was speaking at the ``Sympathy, Support and Solidarity with
Lim Guan Eng'' ceramah at Bukit Mertajam.
	   ``Bank Negara today announced that 1998's first quarter GDP was
-1.8 per cent, the first decline in 13 years.''
	   ``Bank Negara also said non-performing loans rose to 10.6 per
cent in April from 6.7 per cent in December, 1997.''
	   ``In absolute terms, NPLs increased from RM28.3 billion in
December 1997 to RM44.3 billion in April,'' he added.
	   ``With such bad news, I fear for the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
when it opens on Monday and I hope that it will not register a new
low in the 11-month economic crisis in the coming week.''

	   MALAYSIA is grateful to Britain for the assistance it has
rendered to Malaysian students whose education has been affected by
the shortage of funds following the country's economic problems.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim expressed his
appreciation to Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown during a
breakfast meeting yesterday.
	   Anwar, who is Finance Minister, said Malaysia appreciated the
initiative taken by the British Government to look into the funding
problems of its students so that they may continue their studies in
the United Kingdom.
	   It is learnt that the British Government, through its Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, has set up a fund to assist needy Asian
students unable to continue their studies in the UK because of the
region's economic situation.
	   The students requiring assistance are mainly from Indonesia,
Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.
	   The financing for the fund comes from the British Government,
the British Council, several universities and private companies in
Britain which have interests in the affected Asian countries.
	   More details on the fund are expected to be announced next week.
	   Later, speaking to Malaysian journalists at Malaysia Hall after
addressing Malaysian students on the country's economic situation,
Anwar, who was on a two-day working visit to London, expressed
confidence that Malaysia could achieve a 2.5 per cent economic
growth figure for this year.
	   He said he would announce the country's economic growth figures
for the first quarter of the year by next weekend.
	   ``Although the first two months were really drastic and will
reflect adversely on the growth, the March and April figures seem
to be reassuring as there is more positive growth and lending by
the commercial banks.''
	   Anwar also said Malaysia was prepared to liberalise its economic
policy but at its own pace and not on the terms dictated by others.
	   ``We should do it gradually and decide the pace and extent of
liberalisation and ensure we have our indigenous capacity.''
	   He said although Malaysia did not have any major debts and,
unlike some of its neighbours, could still survive the economic
crisis without depending on the International Monetary Fund, it
should learn from the experience of other countries where
corruption existed.
	   ``It is a big crisis which has hit all countries, including
Russia.
	   ``We must therefore resolve to be a united force to deal with
the problem.
	   ``We must resolve to fight corruption because it is a cancer
that can destroy us.''
	   He urged the people to be prepared for change and accept
reforms.
	   ``We do not deny that there is a problem but our fundamentals
are still strong. We need to learn from the experience of others.
Our propensity to change for the better is necessary.
	   ``I am confident that our economy will recover soon and we will
come back even stronger because I believe in the resilience of the
people.
	   ``There is creative destruction and from the ashes of the past,
we will build a new resilience for the future.''
	   Speaking to the students earlier, Anwar said there was no
necessity for a shadow Cabinet in Malaysia as the Opposition was
free to express their ideas.
	   He said although ideas by the British Government are bandied
about with the Opposition's shadow Cabinet over the media, it need
not necessarily be emulated by Malaysia.
	   ``The role of the Opposition in the West should not be
considered ideal for us.''
	   Anwar agreed on the need for transparency through the media but
cautioned against sensationalising issues which could cause tension
among the people.
	   On the prospects of more funding for students involved in
research and development, he said the Government was committed to
promoting RD and had allocated about RM400 million for the purpose
through the Intensification of Research on Priority Areas Scheme.
	   He said local universities such as Universiti Tenaga Nasional
and Universiti Petronas had been asked to provide the necessary
expertise and research centres.

	   KOTA BARU, Sun. - The Syariah Appeals Court today dismissed the
appointment of Datuk Shukri Mohamed as prosecutor on behalf of the
Kelantan Religious and Malay Customs Council (MAIK) in a libel case
involving Pengkalan Chepa MP Mohd Amar Abdullah.
	   The ruling was on the grounds the appointment had not been made
according to procedure.
	   The court, presided by three judges - Datuk Professor Mahmood
Zuhdi Abdul Majid, former Lord President Tun Mohamed Salleh Abas
and Datuk Nik Hashim Nik Abdul Rahman - ruled that Shukri's
appointment could not be made under section 169(1) of the Kelantan
Syariah Criminal Procedure Enactment as was done by Syariah deputy
public prosecutor Abu Bakar Abdullah Kutty.
	   Mahmood Zuhdi, who led the panel of judges, said this was
because the provision in the section stated that a hearing before
the Kadi High Court should be conducted by a prosecutor or a
Syariah lawyer who had been given written permission by the
prosecutor to do so. ``In this case, Shukri is not a Syariah
lawyer.''
	   However, he said Abu Bakar could submit a fresh application to
the Kadi High Court to appoint Shukri as the prosecutor.
	   He also said that there was no need for the Kadi High Court to
get approval from the State Government to do so.
	   Section 170 states that written permission from the court is
required for a lawyer to conduct prosecution on behalf of the State
Government.
	   The ruling was made following Mohd Amar's request, made through
his lawyer, Takiyuddin Hassan for a revision on Shukri's
appointment.
	   Shukri had, on March 15, received sanction from Abu Bakar to act
as prosecutor in the case. The sanction was made under Section 169
of the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Enactment Procedure.
	   Takiyuddin, in his submission today, questioned the legality of
the procedure in Shukri's appointment saying that Shukri's
appointment to act as prosecutor in the case could not be made
under Section 169.
	   He also cited Section 167 which stated that the power to
prosecute was only bestowed on the Syariah prosecutor.
	   Mohd Amar, 34, who is Kelantan Pas Youth vice-chief, had pleaded
not guilty in the Chief Kadi's Court in April last year with
insulting MAIK over a Hari Raya Aidil Fitri sermon in his ceramah
at Jalan Dusun Raja at 10.15pm on March 8, 1997.
	   He is charged under section 121 of the MAIK Enactment 1994. If
found guilty, he can be jailed three years or fined RM5,000, or
both.
	   He was alleged to have used the words kurang cerdik (not so
intelligent) when referring to two or three MAIK officials in his
speech at the ceramah.

PPAs in way of lower tariffs, says Tajuddin, BUSINESS TIMES

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd (Tenaga) says a more efficient generation of
electricity that could lower tariffs is possible, but this will
require existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the
independent power producers (IPPs) to be ``undone''.
	   Executive chairman Datuk Ahmad Tajuddin Ali said if a trading
and settlement of electricity in a free market scheme is adopted,
consumers will benefit from lower tariffs.
	   But this scheme cannot be implemented if the PPAs are still in
place.
	   ``It would be unfair to Tenaga,'' Tajuddin said in an interview
with Business Times.
	   In an electricity trading and settlement market, the IPPs must
inform the independent grid system operator of their plants'
available capacity and their selling price daily.
	   The independent grid system operator - which will manage the
systems operations of the National Grid by the year 2000 - will
then match the demand and supply of electricity at any one time and
buy from the IPP which offers the cheapest price.
	   The electricity will then be directed to Tenaga's National Load
Despatch Centre at Bangsar, which will despatch it to the grid.
	   Tajuddin said in this case, the PPAs become a stumbling block.
	   Under the PPA, Tenaga will have to pay the IPPs an agreed amount
for making their plants available to generate electricity for the
use of the utility.
	   Tenaga is spending more than RM2 billion to buy about 30 per
cent of the electricity generated by the IPPs.
	   The agreement also acts as a guarantee, whereby the IPPs can use
the PPAs - which secure revenue to the companies - to source funds
from financial institutions.
	   Tenaga, however, does not envisioned the settlement and trading
system to be in place for quite some time. It has enough supply and
more than its required capacity.
	   Currently, the installed capacity is closed to 12,000MW while
maximum demand is 8,500 MW.
	   The Government, too, is not ready for commitments on a
settlement and trading of power as restructuring in the electricity
is still on-going.
	   ``I cannot make that commitment without being very sure,''
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie had
said when asked about the idea of a power trading system.
	   ``Once we make a public statement and if it is found not very
practical or workable, we will get ourselves in a jam,'' the
minister had added.
	   A cautious approach to such a system is being taken. The
Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's Department is
looking at its viability and customising it to the local
electricity scenario.
	   Penjanabebas, the association for IPPs, will hold a meeting soon
to discuss the issue.
	   Its honorary president, Encik Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said a
settlement and trading system will lower the entrance barrier and
attract the best participant for the electricity generation
industry.
	   When asked on the impact of the settlement and trading system on
the current PPA, he said ``we have been assured by the Government
that existing agreement will be honoured''.
	   Ahmad Jauhari said concerns will mainly be on industry
restructuring and the reaction from the industry as the settlement
and trading system will have to be viable to attract new
investments.
	   ``The settlement and trading system for power will result in a
liberalised market if it is to be implemented. However, the market
must be mature to accept such a system. The financial market must
also be educated and accept that it a more competitive system,'' he
said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Developing countries should continue to
pursue the agenda for further liberalisation in world trade,
especially in manufacturing.
	   ``Such a move would only be in the interests of developing
countries, especially manufacturing into which these countries are
now in a big way,''
	   Kuala Lumpur International Airport Berhad chairman Tan Sri
Clifford Herbert said.
	   Citing Malaysia, Herbert said, about 80 per cent of Malaysia's
exports were manufactures-based and any denial of access to markets
would have deleterious effects.
	   ``Malaysia is today the 17th largest trading nation and it is in
our interest to maintain an open trading system,'' Herbert, who was
former Finance Ministry secretary general, said.
	   He was speaking at the Harvard Project for Asian and
International Relations conference titled ``Asia in Transition:
Beyond the Miracle'' at the Putra World Trade Centre.
	   Co-organised by Harvard University student organisation, Aiesec
Universiti Putra Malaysia and the International Malaysia Forum, the
conference entered its second day today.
	   The conference aims to engage future leaders in discussions that
demonstrate the complexity of international relations.
	   Speaking on ``Economic Liberalisation: Problems and Prospects'',
Herbert told the audience the recent Apec agreement in Vancouver,
Canada to liberalise trade further in 15 major sectors was a
positive development.
	   ``Malaysia participated in these discussions and the fact that
we could subscribe to this illustrates trade liberalisation is
still very much on our agenda.''
	   ``Malaysia and like minded developing countries however must
insist that liberalisation is not a one-way affair.''
	   Herbert attributed the long lasting growth in Asia to several
factors which included; Increasing trade links with the rest of the
world, with all these countries increasing their share of exports
to the markets of the developed countries, particularly in
manufacturing, and Flow of technology to these countries and high
levels of foreign investment.
	   ``Countries like Malaysia also benefited by the free flow of
labour into these countries, sometimes at costs much lower than
domestic labour.''
	   In the case of Malaysia, foreign labour now amounted to almost
two million, out of a labour force of eight million.
	   ``There is no doubt that liberalisation of markets in trade,
investment, labour and capital contributed to the rapid development
of these economies.
	   ``Strong and purposeful leadership contributed to growth in a
liberalised trading enviroment.''
	   These countries therefore, he added, had a strong commitment to
maintaining open trading systems, free flow of capital, increasing
globalisation and integration with world markets.
	   ``In fact, if the economic crisis had not occurred, a higher
level of liberalisation would have taken place.''

	   KOTA BARU, Sun. - Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
today brushed aside Kelantan Umno's call for his resignation,
saying that it would only strengthen his resolve to hold on to his
post.
	   ``The more Umno urges me to step down, the stronger is my
resolve to hold on to my post,'' he said.
	   Describing himself as Umno's enemy, Nik Aziz said his presence
in the State Government had caused uneasiness among Umno members.
	   As such, he said Umno would come up with various ploys to exert
pressure on him to quit.
	   ``Probably my views on different issues have placed Umno members
in a lot of trouble,'' he told reporters after opening the dadah
awareness programme for village headmen.
	   Kelantan Umno, at its convention yesterday, had passed a
resolution calling Nik Aziz to resign, saying that the State
Government's administration under his leadership was inefficient.
	   On whether the resolution was in retaliation to the recent Pas
call on Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad to step down,
Nik Aziz said it was a political move.
	   Asked on cultural activities after he opened the 1998
International Kite Festival here, Nik Aziz said Kelantan was
drafting a bill requiring cultural performances to conform to
Islamic requirements.
	   The proposed bill was being studied by a special committee
chaired by state Culture, Tourism, Youth and Sports Committee
chairman Abdullah Ya'kub.
	   ``We expect to table the bill at the next sitting of the State
Legislative Assembly,'' Nik Aziz was quoted by Bernama.
	   The committee, comprising academicians and Culture, Arts and
Tourism Ministry officials, among others, will study the forms of
cultural shows that do not contravene Islamic teachings.
	   The proposed bill would also define in general the form of dikir
barat that can be permitted in the state.
	   The State Executive Council last week imposed a freeze on dikir
barat performances following public complaints of undesirable
features projected by the performers.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - For good governance, those in power must
have political legitimacy and be held accountable, Thammasat
University professor of political science, Dr Likhit Dhiravegin
said today.
	   He said the writing of a charter would help reform the existing
fledgling Thai democratic system, caught in the economic crisis.
	   Dhiravegin said reform was inevitable to curb vote-buying,
scramble for cabinet posts, corruption, interference in the civil
service and abuse of the national budget.
	   He said this presenting his paper, ``Good Governance in Asia :
Political Reform and Democratic Development in Thailand'' at the
Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations conference
entitled ``Asia in Transition : Beyond the Miracle'' at the Putra
World Trade Centre.
	   Co-organised by the Harvard University student organisation,
Aiesec Universiti Putra Malaysia and the International Malaysia
Forum, the four-day conference is the first held in Malaysia since
HPAIR's first conference in 1992.
	   Undergraduates and post-graduates from the world's top
universities including Harvard, Yale and Oxford are attending to
exchange perspectives on critical international issues.
	   A new charter would help rectify the defects of the present
system on ascension to power and to institute a control mechanism.
	   First, the ascension to power would be changed in such a way
that more capable people with integrity would be recruited.
	   Mechanisms of control through checks and balances would be
devised to prevent the breaking of laws and the like.
	   ``More importantly, the people must be given their rights and
freedom and be able to participate in the political process,'' he
said.
	   To questions from the floor, Dhiravegin added that changes also
meant the Prime Minister would be chosen by a vote count in the
House of Representatives in lieu of the existing system where the
party with the most seats in the House of Reprentatives would go
around asking other parties to join as a coalition government.
	   The process would afford more transparency.
	   On the economic meltdown, he said it was not solely for lack of
good governance but a coming together of several factors.

Hundreds march against government in Belarus on Children's Day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred people rallied in Minsk on
Monday, International Children's Day, protesting against everything
from the president to the lingering health effects of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster.
	   ``Our children are sick with cancer after the Chernobyl
catastrophe,'' said rally organizer Tatyana Vanina. A reactor at
the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded and caught fire in neighboring
Ukraine in 1986, but much of the radioactive fallout landed in
Belarus.
	   Protesters adopted a resolution calling for the resignation of
President Alexander Lukashenko, accusing him of not being concerned
about the future of the 2.7 million children in Belarus.
	   Lukashenko is a frequent target of protest groups who object to
his authoritarian rule. However, he generally enjoys broad
popularity in the former Soviet republic.

	   AMSTEEL Securities Sdn Bhd has been given written consent to
continue trading by the Securities Commission (SC), on condition
that it complies with the Minimum Liquid Fund (MLF) requirements of
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on or before June 5.
	   Amsteel is one of 12 stockbroking companies with an MLF deficit
reported by the KLSE on May 15. All firms on the list, except for
Amsteel, have been placed under trading restrictions by the KLSE.
	   Omega Securities Sdn Bhd has since been told to cease trading
and the dealer's licence of MBf Northern Securities Sdn Bhd has
been suspended.
	   Labuan Securities's dealer's licence is also suspended. However,
it does meet the MLF requirement.
	   According to the SC, only Omega Securities has not received
written consent to continue with its trading activities.
	   The Commission, replying to a Business Times query, said it has
given ``conditional consent'' to all the other companies (including
Amsteel) to continue with their trading.
	   ``The conditions of restricted trading of the KLSE apply to
these companies,'' the SC said.
	   To date, there has been no announcement that Amsteel is under
trading restrictions.
	   Meanwhile, according to a source, given the MLF deficit in
Amsteel, the SC had issued a ``warning'' cum show-cause letter to
the brokerage asking it to regularise its financial position or
risk being ordered to halt trading or having its licence suspended.
	   The company was also told to submit plans on how it intends to
regularise its financial position, which it replied to. Following
this, it received a letter of extension for three weeks from the
SC. Since the extension, the source said, Amsteel has been
reporting the necessary information to the SC.
	   The source said the staff of Amsteel have been on their toes
working to ensure that the company's financial position is up to
the satisfaction of the SC.
	   Daily operations of the stockbroking company have been under the
SC's watch, the source said, adding that Amsteel has been in
constant contact with the Commission.
	   ``At the end of trading every day, the stockbroking firm has to
report its financial status to the Commission, including its MLF
position,'' said the source.
	   Typically, brokerages hit with a MLF deficit must seek written
consent from the SC to continue trading as stipulated under Section
20A of the Securities Industry Act 1983.
	   What happens following the deficit is an issuance of a
show-cause letter by the SC to the brokerage.
	   The firm, in seeking written consent to continue trading, is
required to disclose to the SC the steps it plans to undertake to
regularise its financial position after which the stockbroking
house will either get conditional consent or an order to stop
trading altogether.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Operators of fast-food outlets will have to
face the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry over
complaints of price increase since last month.
	   The ministry's parliamentary secretary Datuk Tan Chai Ho said
the ministry had been receiving many complaints and that it would
meet with the operators to clarify the matter.
	   ``People are not happy over the price hike, especially of
chicken.
	   Furthermore, the operators usually deal directly with chicken
farmers and thus are not affected by the market price,'' he told
reporters at the Putra World Trade Centre today.
	   Tan said the ministry's enforcement division had already checked
the fast-food outlets for details over the price hike but he
declined to name the affected outlets. He added the operators would
have to explain the rationale for raising the prices.
	   The ministry has been opposed to price hikes although it has
made some concessions due to the rising cost of raw materials. This
led to a corresponding rise in food prices at fast-food outlets.
	   However, consumer backlash accompanied by calls from consumer
groups to boycott chicken has led to the price of chicken to drop.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - East Asian countries need to build up
confidence and attract capital inflow in order to end the economic
problems and put the region back on track.
	   This was the view of scholars and corporate player attending the
plenary session of the Harvard Project for Asian and International
Relations Conference entitled ``Asia in Transition: Beyond the
Miracle.''
	   ``Principally, one of the solutions to end the regional economic
and financial problems is to ensure capital flow back to the
region,'' said Arab-Malaysian Securities Sdn Bhd executive director
Mustafa Mohd Noor.
	   ``And this requires a stable currency market.''
	   ``If the capital flow resumes, the problems will subside. But if
not, liquidity remains tight and it will be hard to suggest when
the problems could be over,'' said Institute of Strategic and
International Studies Malaysia deputy director-general Dr Zainal
Aznam.
	   Zainal added that tight monetary and fiscal policies, as well as
high interest rates and postponement of mega developments, could
also help end the regional problems.
	   Crawford Jameson, a senior official at Morgan Stanley
Singapore's investment and banking division, said building up
confidence was a major task in view of the battering several East
Asian countries took in the last few months.
	   ``But we somehow need to come up with terms which can restore
the loss of confidence in the region,'' said Jameson, who blamed
the regional problems on corruption, inflated assets, weak market
sentiments, ties between politics and business and ``white elephant
projects'', among others.
	   Mustafa said the Indonesian problem and the weakening of the yen
were factors currently dictating the movement of the ringgit and
other regional currencies.
	   ``Currency volatility should delay resumption of capital flows
to the region, and tight liquidity would retain pressure on
interest rates and dampen economic activity.''
	   He said the depreciation of the yen could also affect the
stability of the region's yet-to-be-affected currencies such as
that of Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.
	   ``If these currencies are not stable, the regional economic and
financial problems could prolong.''
	   He however conceded that ``the selling of assets in the United
States by Japanese investors or government to protect the yen could
in turn destabilise the US financial markets and aggravate the
situation in the region''.
	   Mustafa said at this juncture, the ringgit was still sensitive
to the external developments although it had recovered after
hitting a low of RM4.88 against the US dollar in January.
	   He also warned of a potential recession in Malaysia if there was
a delay in capital flow resumption and banks continued facing
liquidity problem.
	   ``The financial and economic problems are hurting the corporate
sector.
	   The companies which are severely affected should consolidate and
restructure and resume business from a lower base.
	   ``The move to recapitalise and retain existing size of business
may only create greater difficulties,'' Mustafa said, noting that
the regional problems were likely to become more widespread unless
global governmental efforts were taken quickly to overcome them.

Denmark's coach presents his squad for the World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's coach Bo Johansson mixed
veteran players and youthful talent in his 22-man World Cup squad
announced Monday.
	   Although Denmark, the 1992 European champions, played poorly in
two recent World Cup warm-up games against Norway and Sweden,
Johansson said there was ``nothing to be negative about.''
	   The side that will play in Group C against France, Saudi Arabia
and South Africa, included three safe bets _ brothers Michael and
Brian Laudrup, and veteran goalie Peter Schmeichel.
	   Michael Laudrup is the only survivor of Denmark's 1986 World Cup
side in Mexico. The 33-year-old will bid farewell to the national
team after the World Cup. His younger brother, Brian, was on the
team that upset mighty Germany to win the 1992 European
Championship in Sweden.
	   One of the world's top keepers, Schmeichel, has been suffering
from a minor injury but Johansson was confident that the Manchester
United's goalie would be fit in time for the World Cup.
	   Schmeichel ``wasn't 100 percent in shape'' when Sweden beat
Denmark 3-0 on May 28, Johansson said.
	   As substitute goalies, Johansson picked Mogens Krogh of the
Danish champion team Broendby, and sole newcomer Peter Kjaer of
Silkeborg, another Danish team.
	   The Danes have only qualified once before for a World Cup.
Denmark surprisingly failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in
the United States and a defensive-minded team flopped in the 1996
European Championship in England.
	   Johansson, a Swede, has 8 wins, 2 draws and 3 defeats since he
became Denmark's coach in 1996.
	   He selected experienced defenders like Marc Rieper, Jan Heintze,
Thomas Helveg and Jes Hoegh on the team once known as ``Danish
Dynamite.''
	   Striker Ebbe Sand, the Danish league's top scorer with 28 goals,
was also selected. His first cap was against Norway on April 22
when Denmark lost 2-0.
	   Other inexperienced players are defender Rene Henriksen who
played his first match on the red-and-white team against Scotland
in March, and forward Martin Joergensen who has played three times
on the Danish side.
	   Johansson who has opted for a 4-4-2 system, said he hadn't
decided what system Denmark would play in France, adding he wanted
to avoid ``the vulnerability of playing only one system.''
	   Before heading for France, Denmark plays a friendly against
Cameroon on Friday in Copenhagen.
	   The squad:
	   Goalies _ Peter Schmeichel, Mogens Krogh, Peter Kjaer,
	   Defenders _ Jes Hoegh, Marc Rieper, Jacob Laursen, Rene
Henriksen, Soeren Colding, Jan Heintze, Michael Schjoenberg, Thomas
Helveg,
	   Midfielders _ Allan Nielsen, Per Frandsen, Morten Wieghorst,
Stig Toefting, Bjarne Goldbaek, Michael Laudrup,
	   Forwards _ Brian Laudrup, Miklos Molnar, Peter Moeller, Martin
Joergensen, Ebbe Sand.

	   CONSTRUCTION WORK on the 26km Sprint highway will continue now
that the project's private contractors have received financing
offers from two banks.
	   Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said the two banks are

trouble getting loans from banks, especially during this period of
economic slowdown,'' Samy Vellu told reporters after opening the
Indian General Contractors Association's second annual general
meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He added that he had brought the matter up with the Cabinet
because infrastructure projects should continue even though the
country is facing an economic slowdown.
	   The minister said there had been no offers of financial
asssistance for the other highway project. This covers the RM585
million New Pantai Highway, which stretches between the existing
intersection of Jalan Subang Utama/Jalan Lengka and the KL-Seremban
Expressway between the existing Jalan Klang Lama/Federal Highway
interchange and the intersection of Jalan Bangsar.
	   He added that it is necessary that work on these two projects
continues as they are important infrastructure schemes.
	   On the Sungai Penchala Link Highway, which is part of the Sprint
Highway, Samy Vellu said it ``is very necessary to relieve
congestion in the Damansara area''.
	   ``Even though the highway project will cut through Malay reserve
land, it is necessary because there are eight townships there, with
a population of about 400,000 people and 100,000 vehicles,'' he
said.
	   The minister added that people need to understand the need for
this highway.
	   He said that although there have been protests from those living
in the Malay reserve land area, he feels ``this highway is a
must''.
	   ``I have already explained to the Cabinet why it is so,'' he
said and added that it will help reduce the number of vehicles
using Jalan Damansara to enter the city.
	   He said that those affected by the highway project will be duly
compensated. ``If an interchange is developed, the people who own
the land there will get even better economic returns.''
	   The minister also spoke about work on seven Indian highway
projects amounting to ``billions of ringgit'' which has been
offered to Malaysian companies.
	   An initial feasibility study on the privatized infrastructure
projects is being conducted by ASS Integrated Sdn Bhd, a local
consulting engineer company. The company will then submit a report
to the Ministry of Surface Transport in India.
	   It is understood that the Construction Industries Development
Board (CIDB) Malaysia is leading the consortium which will
undertake work on some 2,000km of roads and highways.
	   ``The projects are to widen existing two-lane highways into
four-lane highways,'' Samy Vellu said, pointing out that business
is done differently in India as compared to Malaysia.
	   ``In India, the concession company only has to come up with
about 50 per cent financing for the project as the Government will
invest about 30 per cent in the project and sub-loans amounting to
20 per cent are granted,''
	   he said.
	   He added that the Indians had developed further some of
Malaysia's ideas, such as the one on toll charges.
	   Among the highways to be worked on in Andhra Pradesh are the
1,000km stretch of the national highway No. 5 (between Tada and
Ichapuram) and the national highway No. 9, stretching between
Hyderabad and Vijayawada.

	   TIN mining used to be the in thing in the country. The wealthy
were commonly referred to as tauke lombong; the title became even
more apt if the rich person wore khaki shorts which were worn by
the Mat Sallehs -Western bosses who run most of the mines in the
country then.
	   Malaysia's tin mining activities were at his height in the 1950s
and the industry provided employment to the people. The country was
then the world's largest tin producer and held the title for a long
time. Even the secretariat of the Association of Tin Producing
Countries (ATPC) was located in Malaysia due to the strengh of the
industry.
	   Tin, a non-renewable resource, however began to lose its shine
when the world tin market crashed in the mid-1980s. It marked a
turning point for the industry in the country. The world's largest
tin producer became a net importer of the metal in the early 1990s.
	   The low price of tin made mining activities unlucrative in
Malaysia and land was used for more profitable sectors such as
property and oil palm.
	   The cheap price of tin, however, has helped one sector to
prosper -the smelting industry. The two Malaysian smelters - Escoy
Smelting Sdn Bhd and Malaysian Smelting Corp (MSC) - are now
multi-million ringgit businesses.
	   Foreign exchange revenue from export of tin in 1997 totalled
RM479 million against RM533 million in 1996. However, the import of
tin-in-concentrates were valued at RM452 million compared with
RM486 million in 1996. As such, net export revenue in 1997 totalled
RM27 million against RM47 million in 1996. Malaysia exported 31,785
tonnes of refined tin last year, down 2,557 tonnes from 34,342
tonnes in 1996.
	   But even the smelting sector seems to be following the fate of
the tin mining industry. Effective last April, Escoy Smelting had
closed shop, making MSC the country's sole smelter of tin.
Nonetheless, the Malaysian Chamber of Mines had expressed
confidence that MSC can still assist the country remain as the
centre of tin smelting in years to come. With MSC's smelting
capacity of 40,000 tonnes a year, the chamber felt that the company
should have no problems in maintaining the volume of refined tin
metal exports which total some 30,000 tonnes a year.
	   Tin's only avenue for maintaining its name in the country's list
of revenue-earning industries is the Mineral Development Policy - a
policy which allows the mining industry to diversify its sources
and not limit itself to mining tin only.
	   Unfortunately, the adoption of the Mineral Development Policy by
states has been too slow for the industry's liking. Malaysian
Chamber of Mines president Abdul Sukor Shahar had said although
several roadshows had been conducted to explain the implementation
and benefits of the policy, not much progress has been made. Except
for Sarawak, which had incorporated several of the provisions into
its State Mining Enactment, the other states have remained quiet.
	   It is a sad that the new policy, which was intended to give a
needed boost to the tin mining industry, invoked only lukewarm
response from state governments.
	   The MDC aims to generate mining investments and offer
socio-economic developments to the states, especially those with
mineral potential. The earlier the states realise these advantages,
the faster the economic benefits to be reaped.
	   The year will undoubtedly see more roadshows by relevant
authorities and tin-related associations to convince state
governments to adopt and implement the MDP.
	   While the country's tin mining days are numbered, there is no
reason why it should not continue to tap its remaining tin
reserves.
	   Granted that it is not viable to solely concentrate on tin
mining, there is no harm in simultaneously mining both the metal
and other minerals such as silica, ball clay, gold and marble
stones.
	   The diversification of mining activities may in the long term
spur the sector to become a major revenue earner for the country
once again. And perhaps this time there will be more tauke lombongs
around.

	   KOTA BARU, Fri. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad
said today the Government will continue to help big and small
Bumiputera companies to enable them to compete with other races in
the business sector.
	   He said that it was the Government's responsibility to ensure
that all races share the country's wealth.
	   ``If we allow all the Bumiputera companies to collapse, we will
be placed in a situation before the New Economic Policy was
introduced, where the poor were generally the Malays,'' he added.
	   He said, however, the Government would only assist Bumiputera
companies which had the potential to succeed and that ``there is no
favouritism''.
	   Dr Mahathir said the Government's assistance to Bumiputeras was
often interpreted by certain foreign quarters as helping
``government cronies'' as if they were favoured by the Government.
	   ``Such allegations were made because they are envious of the
achievements of the Malays. They actually want the Malays to remain
the poorest race in the country. They have bad intentions and if
possible, they want us to remain stupid.
	   ``Even if a Malay businessman succeeds without Government's
assistance, he will still be labelled a government crony,'' he
added.
	   He was addressing a large crowd at the launch of the Kelantan
Multimedia, Telecommunications and Electronic Exposition (Emtek
'98) at Sekolah Menengah Chabang Empat Pasir Mas/Tumpat.
	   Dr Mahathir was accompanied by his wife Datin Seri Dr Siti
Hasmah Mohd Ali. Others present included former Deputy Prime
Minister Tun Abdul Ghafar Baba, MP for Gua Musang Tengku Razaleigh
Hamzah, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed,
Rural Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa, Umno Youth chief
Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani
Othman and Umno Information chief Datuk Dr Yusof Nor.
	   Dr Mahathir said since the NEP was introduced, thousands of jobs
were created as well as scholarships given which enabled children
in the rural areas to pursue their education which later enabled
them to compete on equal footing with other races.
	   He said these efforts helped the economy and created many
millionaires and even billionaires.
	   ``We should be proud of them. We don't question who they are
because they are our representatives from among the Malays in the
country. We want all the races to be equal.
	   ``We do not want a situation where the poor are the Malays and
the rich are from other races. This is a dangerous situation and
can lead to chaos in the country,'' he added.
	   Dr Mahathir also advised the people to familiarise themselves
with information technology so that they could use IT to assist in
the nation's progress.
	   ``The use of IT is everywhere. It has created a borderless
world. But there is now an attempt to colonise nations using IT
instead of war planes or canons.''
	   He said an example of the power of IT was the transfer of
millions of ringgit from one country to another with the touch of a
button.
	   ``We now have a borderless world. The world has become as if one
country.
	   People can move anywhere without restrictions and without
respect for our borders.
	   ``I do not know if this was done on purpose to control us but
the fact is that they have succeeded in making us poor, and because
of that, they are able to control our economy. They get richer and
richer.''
	   Dr Mahathir said as the value of the ringgit depreciated, so
would the people's purchasing power.
	   When this happens, he said, the people could not buy imported
products, such as milk, wheat and medicine, and as a consequence,
the people would revolt and blame the Government.
	   ``So, they are not only creating economic problems but political
and social problems as well,'' he added.
	   Citing Indonesia as an example, he said the country with more
than 200 million people and experiencing a growth rate of seven per
cent for several years was now made poor following the fall in the
value of the rupiah.
	   ``The people have forgotten the efforts of the Government to
build the country over the past 30 years. At one stage, Indonesia
was regarded as one of the economic tigers of Asia.''
	   However, he said, when the rupiah was attacked, it caused
numerous problems, including high cost of essential items which
have to be imported, the closure of 16 banks, the closure of 10,000
companies and the loss of jobs for 20 million people.
	   Speaking to reporters later, Dr Mahathir said the development of
the Multimedia Super Corridor would proceed despite the current
economic situation.
	   He said the economic problems in the region had also affected
the finances of companies planning to invest in the MSC.
	   For example, he said, companies in Japan have slowed down their
investment abroad and this would affect the MSC.
	   Asked if the economic problems could be overcome soon, Dr
Mahathir said it could not be solved in the short term because ``we
have lost the power to dictate the rise and fall of currency''.

	   AYAMAS Food Corp Bhd (AFCB) will jointly undertake with the
Perlis State Government a large-scale broiler contract farming
project.
	   The leading local poultry processor and retailer recently signed
an agreement with the Perlis State Government to formalise the
project which will supply an estimated one million birds every
year.
	   The project involves the construction of a 200ha broiler farm
located in Padang Besar, Perlis.
	   Signing on behalf of the Perlis State Government was its Menteri
Besar Datuk seri Shahidan Kassim and representing Ayamas was KFC
Holdings (M) Bhd executive deputy chairman Datuk Ishak Ismail.
	   ``This project marks a significant business venture for us as we
will be transferring our skills and knowledge of the poultry
industry to farmers in Perlis,'' said Ayamas chief operating
officer Ms Foo Peng Peng in a statement released in Kuala Lumpur
recently.
	   She said, a team of qualified veterinarians from Ayamas Food
will give professional advice on the raising of chicks or broilers
following strict quality control measures.
	   ``We will also be supplying quality feed to the farm to ensure
that the broilers achieve satisfactory growth during the 40 to
45-day cycle,'' she added.
	   The farm, according to her, will be supplying around 50,000
birds per cycle. This will gradually increase to 300,000 birds per
cycle in the long term.
	   The MOU she pointed out, looks toward a long-term understanding
and with time it is expected that more farmers will realise the
lucrative returns of such a joint venture.
	   In August last year, Ayamas signed an agreement with the
Selangor Farmers Organisation (LPP Selangor) to undertake broiler
contract farming for the supply of an estimated 5.4 million birds a
year.
	   At present the company's two processing plants in Bukit Mertajam
and Port Klang process around 2.2 million birds per month. With the
completion of the RM30 million upgrading exercise for the Port
Klang plant by 1999, production is expected to increase by around
50 per cent.
	   To date, Ayamas supplies fresh chicken to KFC's network of over
255 restaurants, 58 Pizza Hut restaurants and 45 Ayamas convenience
stores, as well as the open market comprising supermarkets,
hypermarkets, wholesalers, hotels and restaurants throughout the
country.

	   KOTA BARU, Fri. - Former Deputy Prime Minister Tun Ghafar Baba
urged the people to unite and give their full support to the
Government in its efforts to overcome the economic problems
besetting the country.
	   ``This is the time for the people to show their love for the
country and by being united and giving support to the Government in
its measures to overcome the problem. We may be able to expedite
the nation's economic recovery,'' he said after meeting Umno
members last night.
	   He was here as part of his nationwide tour to explain to Umno
members about the economic slowdown.
	   Ghafar likened the economic problems to a house on fire.
	   ``Hence, as the occupants of the house, we should help to put
out the flames instead of pointing fingers at one another as this
can worsen the situation and may lead to political instability,''
he added.
	   He said the people should not be worried as efforts were being
made to ensure the recovery of the country's economy.
	   ``The people should help by reducing their expenditure,
especially on vegetables, by planting them,'' he added.
	   He also expressed the need for the people to understand the
reasons for the assistance given by the Government to Bumiputera
companies facing financial problems following the economic
slowdown.
	   ``It is not to help individuals or the owners of the companies
concerned,'' he said, adding that the Government only assisted
companies which can bring revenue to the Government.
	   ``The Government helps these companies because they bring
foreign exchange to the country.''

	   BANK Negara Malaysia (BNM) remains optimistic about the
economy's outlook despite the negative growth for the first
quarter, but three factors will be crucial in determining a better
second-half performance.
	   These are a higher export level, strong fundamentals in the
banking system, and a stable ringgit.
	   Its governor, Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don, elaborated on these
factors at a press briefing last Saturday when asked for the bank's
economic outlook for the second half of the year.
	   He had just announced a negative 1.8 per cent growth in the
gross domestic product (GDP), the country's first negative
quarterly growth in over a decade.
	   In terms of export, Malaysia recorded a large external trade
surplus of RM8.8 billion during the first quarter due to a a
sharper decline in imports in US dollar terms. The surplus for the
corresponding period of last year was RM1.7 billion.
	   Official statistics, however, show that on a quarter-to-quarter
basis, the country's export has seen a sharp increase to RM69.8
billion in January-March 1998 from RM49 billion in January-March
1997.
	   Ahmad Don said whether the country is able to increase its
export level for the rest of the year is, therefore, paramount.
	   ``But I must also say that other (countries) affected in the
regional economic turmoil will also be trying their best to export
themselves out of the problems,'' he added.
	   Maintaining the fundamental strengths in the banking system is
an ``all- important'' factor, the governor said.
	   This is why the central bank has to ensure that financial
institutions must continue to strive to achieve the 15 per cent
loan growth target by year-end as stipulated in its credit plan, he
added.
	   Another important factor is the exchange rate of the ringgit.
	   ``In the past few months, the ringgit has been relatively
stable, although it remains vulnerable,'' Ahmad Don said.
	   The ringgit has lost 33.5 per cent of its value against the US
dollar since July last year.
	   Last Friday, the ringgit ended at 3.89 against the greenback,
compared with 2.52 at the end of June 1997.
	   The local currency has also lost significantly against the
values of other major currencies.
	   Ahmad Don said the first quarter's contraction in GDP growth
will have to be taken into account in making a forecast for the
entire 1998.
	   ``At some point in time, we may have to relook at these
numbers,'' he added.
	   The Government had announced last March a revised GDP growth
figure of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent amid the weakened
Malaysian and regional economies.
	   The January-March negative growth was attributable to various
factors.
	   On the supply side, decline in output was most apparent in the
construction, manufacturing and agriculture sectors, given the
sluggish external demand especially from the Asian market.
	   On the demand part, negative wealth effects due to asset
deflation and the rising inflation rate led to more cautious
consumer sentiment, which adversely affected private consumption.
	   Output in the manufacturing sector declined 2.4 per cent on an
annual basis compared with a 10.9 per cent growth in the last
quarter of 1997.
	   The decline was broad-based, affecting both the domestic as well
as the export-oriented industries.
	   For the construction sector, sharp slowdown in construction
activity led to the sector recording a 10 per cent decline.
	   This was due to a slowdown in implementation of the existing
infrastructure and non-residential projects and also completion of
projects associated with the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.
	   Meanwhile, inflation rose significantly in the first quarter of
1998 with the higher import prices due to the weaker ringgit being
passed down to domestic price levels, pushing the consumer price
index up by 4.3 per cent (1994  100) against 2.7 per cent increase
in the last quarter of 1997.
	   At producer level, the producer price index (PPI, 1989    100)
also
rose significantly by 14.9 per cent reflecting the higher prices of
both domestic and imported inputs.	   The overall position of the Federal Government remained in
surplus. The current and overall accounts recorded larger surpluses
of RM5.4 billion and RM4.2 billion respectively.
	   The Government's total debt declined by 2.4 per cent from the
level as at the end of 1997 to RM87.8 billion at the end of March
this year, attributed to reductions in both the domestic and
external debts.

<TEXT>
	   WORLD Bank president James D. Wolfensohn began his Press
conference by first apologising to the journalists present for the
criticism he was about to make of the media for being too
simplistic in its reporting of the Asian financial problem.
	   The media, it seems, likes figures too much. The international
bail-out efforts of Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand have been
summarised in dollars and cents - US$45 billion here, US$50 billion
there - and not much of anything else.
	   Its pre-occupation with headline-grabbing figures, and the
righteous calls for economic and political reforms, led to the
media's inability to look into the social consequences of the
financial trouble and the bail-outs.
	   The millions who were suffering, for example, as a pre-requisite
to participation in the International Monetary Fund programmes,
were somehow lost in the debates on whether to extend loans to the
troubled economies.
	   Speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum Finance
Ministers Meeting that ended in Kananaskis, Canada last week,
Wolfensohn told of the millions in Indonesia who would fall into
poverty, and whose lives would be greatly affected by food and
medicine shortages. The number of those joining the ranks of the
unemployed was also expected to balloon in the near future.
	   In Thailand, he said, the poor state of the economy was breaking
down the traditional support system resulting in the millions
returning to their villages from the cities not receiving the help
they would have had from their families. As a result, crime and
child prostitution were now on the rise, he said.
	   In South Korea, the fragile truce between the trade union,
government and businesses needed for the implementation of the IMF
programme was showing signs of cracks. That could lead to social
chaos.
	   While the economic woes in these countries were the root of the
problems, they nevertheless could be alleviated if the
international efforts to rescue them had spared some thought to
people on the street.
	   Debates on the pros and cons of giving the loans took the high
ground, criticising governments for the way they do things and
demanding reforms before help could be given, while in the lower
rung of society, the people suffered.
	   In Indonesia, for example, the IMF insistence that the food and
fuel subsidies be removed, as they were economically unsustainable
and unsound, resulted in rioting in the streets that saw about 500
people dead.
	   Regardless of whatever romantic notions one might have on the
uprising - that people took to the streets to rid the country of
cronyism, nepotim, collusion or corruption - it was food and fuel
that led to the burning and looting.
	   A hungry mob, after all, is an angry mob.
	   Wolfensohn was not alone in expressing his regret. The cool
setting at the lodge in Kananaskis at the foot of the Canadian
Rockies where this year's meeting was held could not escape the
rioting and death in Indonesia. They served as constant reminders
that, in the end, decisions in high places, no matter how noble,
sometimes have their own peculiar spin on the masses.
	   Apec Finance Ministers in their final statement recognised that
any rescue effort has to have a heart. It must be tempered with the
need to take care of the poor and needy who were already badly hit
by any economic trouble, and would suffer more in any adjustment
programme.
	   Even the IMF agreed that some of its measures were harsh, said
Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim who represented
Malaysia at the meeting.
	   Camdessus, he said, agreed that IMF would continue to be
flexible with its programmes to make sure that the hardest hit
would not be much worse off.
	   It was not as if the IMF was extracting its pound of flesh from
the Indonesians, it was just that no one foresaw how bad the effect
of the measures, as they trickle down the system, would be on the
people.
	   They nevertheless served as sombre reminders that while bitter
medicine might sometimes be called for, to quote Camdessus who was
also at the meeting, the treatment must not be so harsh as to wreak
havoc on the body.
	   The medical anology had been used many times to justify the
actions taken by the IMF. It is true that within its own field of
competence such harsh measures were the only recourse. But care
must be taken to make the medicine go down easier.
	   Nevertheless, Anwar said the international community must assist
the IMF, either through bilateral measures or through agencies like
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, whose functions were
more suited for social programmes, while it was the IMF's job to
help turn around economies.
	   Anwar also took to task countries like the US, that wanted to
see more being done in Indonesia before it could support the
resumption of IMF loans, which had since been suspended, to the
country.
	   The Deputy Prime Minister, who became the unofficial spokesman
for Indonesia at the meeting since the country was only represented
by its ambassador to Canada, said he believed there was a genuine
attempt by President B.J. Habibie to undertake economic and social
reforms, and he should be given as much support as possible.
	   The US should not expect immediate reform from Indonesia; it
took the US more than 100 years to carry out similar reforms, he
said.
	   While the situation in Indonesia dominated the meeting, the
general financial health of Apec member economies was also
discussed at length, including trying to identify ways to minimise
the possibility of the Asian financial downturn recurring.
	   It was generally agreed that, currency speculators and
manipulators notwithstanding, the slowdown was caused by the weak
macroeconomic environment in the affected countries. Unsustainable
policies coupled with poor governance and the dependence on foreign
money made them vulnerable.
	   The Kananaskis meeting agreed that increased surveillance of the
macroeconomic conditions of countries be established, either
through peer pressure, or a regional or global monitoring body. The
ministers also agreed to continue looking at how best to deal with
the influx of short-term capital flows. Though welcome, they had
the tendency to disrupt economies as was seen in the days leading
to the regional financial difficulty.
	   The Finance Ministers also agreed to look at an initiative of
the Apec financiers, made up of the private sector of member
economies, for the development of domestic and regional bond
markets as an alternative to raising funds for business and
development.
	   The over-dependence on short-term debts, where credit lines were
easily recalled, had been the downfall of many business in the
region. Long-term debts like bonds were less likely to be withdrawn
and would be more consistent.
	   Incidentally, there are two versions of how Kananaskis got its
name.
	   The first, rather appropriately, means a meeting place in the
local Indian dialect.
	   The other, the fable goes, the place is named after a Indian
named Kananaskis. Apparently, while chopping wood he injured
himself badly in the head and people thought he would not make it.
But he miraculously recovered, and in honour of the magical
recovery, they name the river and lake nearby after him.
	   Perhaps the Canadians were thinking of the good vibes of the
place, rather than its beautiful setting, in deciding to hold the
meeting there.
	   Some of the injuries to the troubled Asian economies seemed
self-inflicted, but many believe that they would emerge stronger
over time.
	   For that no miracle will be necessary, only hard work.

Citing `new climate,' OAS president says Cuba could be readmitted ANA CAROLINA GRIFFIN

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A ``new climate'' created by Pope John
Paul II's visit earlier this year to Cuba is making it more likely
that the communist-run island may rejoin the Organization of
American States, the OAS secretary-general said Monday.
	   ``It's clear for everyone that since the visit of John Paul II
to the island a new climate has been created in which this issue
can be addressed in a more constructive manner,'' Cesar Gaviria
said in opening the OAS' 28th general assembly.
	   If economic and political liberties and respect for human rights
are broadened on the island, ``it will be possible to consider the
return of Cuba to the Inter-American system,'' said Gaviria, the
former president of Colombia.
	   Mexico's foreign secretary, Rosario Green, suggested that a
``group of friends'' of Latin American nations be formed to help
resolve the issue.
	   Cuba was thrown out of the OAS in 1962 after strong pressure
from the United States, which accused Castro of supporting leftist
rebel groups in Latin America.
	   While not mentioning the United States directly, Gaviria seemed
to criticize the U.S. hard-line stance against Cuba.
	   ``Many of us would like to see applied to this problem the type
of diplomacy, negotiation and gradualism that have been effective
in other regions,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a fierce critic of
Cuban President Fidel Castro, is scheduled to attend the OAS
meeting Tuesday.
	   Delegates cannot make a decision on the issue because Cuba has
not requested readmission to the OAS. However, pressure could be
built up for later addressing the issue officially.
	   Castro has enjoyed a string of recent political victories,
including the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and
the re-establishment of diplomatic ties with the Dominican Republic
and Guatemala.
	   The three-day OAS meeting also is expected to address subjects
including poverty, drug trafficking, corrupt justice systems and
consolidating democracy.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - A lawyer, who brought an action against a
legal firm for wrongful dismissal two year ago, was awarded
RM135,000 in back wages and compensation by the Industrial Court.
	   Industrial Court chairman Abu Hashim Abu Bakar, in ordering the
Johor Baru-based legal firm of Gary Yuen  Tan to pay Diana Ann
Seah RM120,000 in backwages and RM15,000 as compensation for loss
of employment, said to reinstate her would not be conducive to a
healthy working environment for both the parties.
	   In his judgment, handed down on May 20 and made available to the
Press today, he said the firm had failed to hold a domestic inquiry
before terminating the services of Diana.
	   He said she was was not given the chance to redeem herself of
the charges brought by the firm during the hearing stage on why she
was dismissed.
	   ``As a company, being a firm of advocates and solicitors at
that, how could it have blundered on this basic duty of due
enquiry?'' he asked.
	   Diana had claimed she commenced her employment with the firm in
April, 1995, with a salary of RM5,000 per month until she was
terminated without any explanation on March 31, 1996.
	   The firm had alleged at the hearing that among the reasons for
it to dismiss Diana was that she had been dishonest, misrepresented
the firm, was habitually late and gave wrong advice to clients.

	   BINARIANG Bhd, in a surprise move, is believed to have
successfully wooed Singapore Telecom Ltd to be its second foreign
equity partner.
	   The deal - which was to be deliberated on by the Binariang board
of directors yesterday evening - is said to be worth about RM1.4
billion.
	   Officials at Binariang declined comment on the deal - which is
expected to see SingTel taking up a 40 per cent stake in the
telecommunications firm.
	   As existing foreign partner US West International will still
hold its 19.8 per cent stake in Binariang, this deal will be the
first to see foreign equity in a local telecommunications firm
exceed 50 per cent.
	   This is however subject to there being no change to Binariang's
paid-up capital.
	   Should there be new issue of Binariang shares to SingTel, the
overall foreign equity structure could be lower and the existing
local majority shareholder - Tunku Burhanuddin's Trust Fund - may
still remain the single largest shareholder.
	   The Government recently raised the maximum for foreign equity in
a telecommunciations firm to 61 per cent, up sharply from the
previous cap of 49 per cent.
	   However, the 61 per cent cap is subject to total foreign equity
being scaled back to 49 per cent within a five-year period.
	   Analysts said the deal could be good for Binariang as it
represents much-needed cash infusion into the company - believed to
have been facing cash-flow problems in terms of funding capital
expansions.
	   Despite a strong revenue base from its Maxis cellular subscriber
base - which passed the 360,000 mark early this year - Binariang
had to suspend its fixed-line expansion plans this year due to the
property sector slowdown.
	   This fixed line expansion represents a long-term growth strategy
for Binariang and also for its sister company, Measat Broadcasting
Sdn Bhd, which operates the cable television network Astro.
	   With the fixed-line infrastructure - including fibre optic cable
connections -Astro programmes can be pumped directly into
subscribers' homes without need for the VSAT (very small aperture
terminal) dish.
	   The analyst said SingTel's involvement could further assist
Binariang in expanding its subscriber base for Astro to Singapore
and the rest of the region.
	   Also, SingTel has a number of investments in foreign
telecommunications firms abroad and the tie-up could see more
optimum usage of Binariang's two communications satellites - Measat
I and II.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Students in several cities, in a move resembling
their colleagues' stand in Jakarta recently, are occupying local
legislative councils to make their demands heard.
	   While those in Jakarta took over the House of
Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly building in order to
press former president Soeharto to resign, those in Jambi have been
occupying the provincial legislature and governor's office in their
fight against rampant gambling.
	   Students in Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi, are
occupying the legislative council building to demand that Governor
Z.B. Palaguna, whom they considered corrupt, to step down.
	   Antara reported from Jambi, the capital of Jambi, that dozens of
students of Sultan Thaha Saifuddin Institute for Islamic Studies
have entered the fourth day of their occupation of the legislative
building yesterday, while those from Jambi University camped out at
the governor's office.
	   On Saturday, they held free speech forums lashing out at
authorities who have allowed various forms of gambling to flourish
in the province of 2.4 million. The capital's population is
412,000.
	   Both groups said separately that they would not budge until the
authorities burned down all slot machines.
	   Joeslin Nasution, a legislator of the United Development Party,
joined the free speech forum staged by the IAIN students and
pledged to bring the students' demand to the attention of the
House.
	   Provincial council chairman Chaeruddin was also supportive of
the students' demand and said his office would pressure the
military to get rid of all gambling machines.
	   In Ujungpandang, hundreds of students from 42 universities
occupying the provincial council building are demanding that
Governor Palaguna be held accountable for what they described as
rampant corruption, collusion and nepotism in the province.
	   They said that they would not leave the building until the
governor stood down.
	   ``We also demand the auditing of local officials' wealth,'' said
Muh Ichsan, chairman of the Association of Makassar Students .
	   Maj. Gen. Suadi Marasabessy, chief of the Wirabuana Military
Command overseeing Sulawesi, joined a free speech forum staged by
students on Saturday but reminded them that the provincial council
had no authority to sack the governor.
	   Only the president has authority to sack a governor, he said.
	   Kallo Bandaso, the provincial council's deputy chairman, said he
would bring the students' demand to the provincial council and
consult the governor about it.
	   ``The students' demand will be channeled to the central
government, although it is not the provincial council's stance,''
he said.
	   Separately, Palaguna said that he would allow himself to be
audited.
	   He said that all local officials were also expected to volunteer
to do the same if needed.
	   In Surabaya, East Java, nine soldiers were punished for their
``disciplinary actions'' in handling student demonstrations. There
were no details given about the violation but some student
demonstrations in the province had been handled forcefully by the
military.
	   Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman, chief of the Brawijaya Military
Command overseeing East Java, said that the nine soldiers were
serving detention sentences of two week.
	   ``Soldiers should be strict in enforcing the law but on the
other hand, strict actions will certainly be taken against those
violating the law,'' he said yesterday after briefing 1,000
military and police officers in the city.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Singer Siti Nurhaliza, pop group BM Boys
and Malaysia's own James Bond girl Michelle Yeoh called on
Malaysians to stand united in facing the country's economic
problems.
	   They were among celebrities at the Semarakkan Semangat Cinta
Malaysia concert organised by the MCA at Dataran Merdeka tonight.
	   Organised as part of the MCA's Love Malaysia, Buy Malaysian
Goods campaign, the concert was aimed at promoting unity and
patriotism, as well as spurring Malaysians to help revitalise the
country's economy by buying local goods.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who was
accompanied by his wife Datin Seri Dr Siti Hasmah Mohd Ali, was the
guest of honour at the open-air concert.
	   MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said the campaign was
enjoying ``encouraging'' support from Malaysians of all walks of
life.
	   ``With united support from the people, we will surely be able to
meet the challenges posed by these economic problems.''
	   Present were the party's deputy president, Datuk Lim Ah Lek,
Wanita MCA chief Datuk Teng Gaik Kwan and its Youth chief Datuk
Chan Kong Choy, as well as other senior party officials.

	   PROFITABLE ENTERPRISE ... Not many people realise that dried
squids which are considered delicacies by some, are produced mostly
in Terengganu, mainly in Marang, Kuala Terengganu and Besut.
	   Mohd Yusof Muda, 45, a dried squid producer and supplier in
Kampung Air Tawar, Kuala Besut, said unlike fish which are caught
only at certain times of the year, squids are available year round
even during the wet seasons.
	   His son-in-law, Fadzil Zabidi Zakaria (picture), helps him in
the business.
	   ``There's hardly a time where we cannot get squids and that is
why I have sufficient supply to meet the customers' demands,'' Mohd
Yusof said.
	   During the peak season, he would process up to 300 kilogrammes
of squids daily. That happens between January and October when
fishermen will have abundant harvests of squids.
	   Each kilogramme of squid normally costs between RM7 and RM8
while the dried ones cost RM40 per kg, he said.
	   He said that to produce dried squids, one only had to cut and
clean them before putting them to dry.
	   ``However, to retain their natural flavour, the squids must be
thoroughly washed with sea water before being dried,'' he added.
	   Mohd Yusof, who has been in the business for 13 years, said
during the rainy season, the squids would be processed in a smoke
house where they were left to dry over a slow fire.
	   He said besides selling the product in the district, he also
supplied the dried squids to Penang, Malacca, Johor and Negri
Sembilan.

	   KOTA BARU, Sun. - Umno members in Kelantan should build people's
confidence in the party and Barisan Nasional if they are to wrest
the State from Pas in the next general election.
	   State Umno deputy liaison chief Datuk Annuar Musa said the party
should be strong and united.
	   ``People have the impression that Kelantan Umno is divided. We
have to shed that image and this can be done if there is
co-operation from all party leaders and members in Kelantan.
	   ``We have to work as a team, failing which we will not get the
support from the people,'' he told reporters after opening the
Kelantan Umno Convention at Perdana Resort at Pantai Cahaya Bulan
yesterday.
	   Annuar, who is also Rural Development Minister, said Umno
divisions in the State should enlighten the people on the benefits
they would receive if the Barisan Nasional was returned to power.
	   ``The Federal Government will be able to provide more
(assistance) for the Kelantan people if Barisan Nasional is also in
power in the State,'' he said.
	   He said Pas, despite ruling Kelantan, could not do much to
develop the State.
	   ``The State Government requires Federal assistance and whenever
faced with problems, the leaders seek the Federal Government's
assistance,'' he added.
	   He also expressed regret over the attitude of the State
Government leaders for not telling the truth.
	   ``They come to us (Federal Government) for assistance, but when
they return (to Kelantan), they tell the people different things,''
he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): New Minister of Education and Culture Juwono
Sudarsono has said student organizations will no longer have to
fall in line with the dictates of university rectors.
	   ``Student organizations will be independent. They will no longer
depend on rectors but on the higher learning institution's academic
values,'' he said after the transfer of job ceremony from his
predecessor Wiranto Arismunandar here last Thursday.
	   He explained student organizations would be free of rectors'
interference in their activities, including elections of leaders.
	   But he advised students to ``be gentlemen'' and conduct fair,
sportsmanlike elections, including if they ended up on the losing
ticket.
	   ``A student who loses an election should fairly recognize his
rival's victory and should not establish a counter organization.''
	   He continued that students would be allowed to invite noted
figures, including government critics, as campus speakers.
	   ``But those invited to speak on campus should abide by all
rulings prevailing there...,'' he said. ``There is no such thing as
absolute freedom.''
	   Freedom comes with its own set of responsibilities, he added.
	   ``When I was recently invited to deliver my speech at the
University of Ohio in the United States, I also complied with the
country's laws. I could not say: 'Clinton must be killed'. The
freedom has its own limit.''
	   He said exceptions might be made for those invited to a limited
forum attended by experts and intellectuals.
	   ``This is a matter that is the same as the question of how to
treat a photo of a naked body. Among physicians, it is a scientific
photo, but to the public it is pornography.''
	   Juwono's progressive remarks are a marked departure from the
stance of several of his predecessors, who rigidly defined the
limits of student activism and barred political speeches from
campuses.
	   In the past, student organizations were even prevented from
inviting political party representatives to address them on their
campuses.
	   Asked about democracy on campus, the minister said students
should realize they should strike a balance between academic
responsibilities and social activities.
	   He said he would forge cooperation with rectors of private and
state universities and institutes to reach a consensus on a code of
ethics on campus.
	   ``A consensus is needed so that academic activities should not
be affected by social ones usually conducted outside of the
campuses,'' he was quoted as saying by Antara news agency.
	   ``If there is no consensus, the campus will certainly become an
arena for political parties and groups of ideologies to compete,
the way they did years ago.''
	   He cited the opinion of German sociologist Max Weber, who
insisted that campus activities should be untainted by meddlings of
political parties.
	   Lessons could also be learned from campus turmoil of 30 years
ago.
	   ``During the 1960s, political parties entered campuses and
student brawls became unavoidable. It was no longer a war of
thought but a war of fists. Campus independence should be upheld
and maintained.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Human Resources Development Council's
re-training programme is meant strictly for workers retrenched or
expected to be laid off by employers who have contributed to the
fund, Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek said today.
	   ``There is no move by the HRDC to expand the programme to those
who have not joined the work force yet,'' he told a Press
conference after he opened the MCA Youth 35th annual general
assembly at the Tunku Abdul Rahman College.
	   He said the council had set aside RM5 million for the
re-training programme and those who had lost their jobs or were
about to be retrenched could apply for re-training.
	   ``These programmes would give the retrenched workers added value
to their careers,'' he said, adding that it would be unfair to open
it up to everyone.
	   The Human Resource Development Fund was set up whereby
participating companies, particularly manufacturers, contributed
one per cent of their payroll to the fund.
	   ``As trustee, our concern is to ensure that those affected by
the economic problems would be given priority,'' said Lim.
	   Lim also reiterated that the ministry would review the ``no levy
collection'' for six months for the fund which took effect from
March, this year.
	   He said since the HRDF was set up, more than 1.7 million workers
had been re-trained to upgrade their skills.
	   ``We are also getting a lot of applications from training
providers to take part in training programmes,'' he added.
	   Lim said even the World Bank had acknowledged that the HRDF was
an important component in helping to upgrade workers' skill and to
help improve career prospects.
	   He reiterated that the highly-disciplined workforce in the
country had helped the country in facing the economic problems.
	   ``Credit must also be given to the trade unions who prefer to
settle disputes and problems through negotiations,'' he added.
	   Unlike other countries facing the same problems, Lim said, there
were no industrial disputes to disrupt the Government's move to
tackle the economic downturn through various tough measures.

Norwegian Coach: ``Brazil not as good as FIFA ranking'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Brazil are a hot favorite to win their fifth
World Cup title in France, but Norwegian Coach Egil ``Drillo''
Olsen said Monday there is a chance the defending champions would
not make it to the second round.
	   ``Brazil is not as good as the FIFA ranking suggests, and it is
not unlikely that they will be beaten by two of the teams in Group
A. But I don't think that will happen,'' Olsen said.
	   Brazil tops FIFA's ranking, Norway is seventh.
	   Brazil opens the World Cup against Scotland on June 10.
	   In May 1997, Olsen's team stunned the soccer world by beating
Brazil 4-2 in Oslo.
	   Olsen's concern now is Norway's Group A opener against Morocco
on June 10.
	   ``Morocco is not going to be a push over. I was impressed when
Morocco held France to a draw. However, England was a
disappointment in their scoreless tie against Belgium,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Soeharto's resignation from the presidency last
month threw the door wide open for greater political expression,
and also put back on the front burner a long-simmering debate over
whether there should be religion-affiliated political parties.
	   Last week, President B.J. Habibie said the government would
allow establishment of just about any political parties, as long as
their political platform was not tainted by SARA -- an Indonesian
acronym for polarizing societal forces of differences in tribal
affiliations, religion, race and societal groups.
	   Some applauded Habibie's apparently magnanimous statement, but
others were condemnatory. They said the President -- for many,
indelibly tarred with the brush of the restrictive Soeharto regime
-- was merely paving the way for him to use his own discretion in
approving any new parties.
	   Moslem scholars Amien Rais and Nurcholish Madjid, Catholic
scholars Frans Seda and Y.B. Mangunwijaya and political scientist
Ichlasul Amal are among those who have come out against
religion-affiliated political parties due to the fear it could play
up religious differences and ultimately tear national unity
asunder.
	   Others strongly beg to differ.
	   Constitutional law expert Yusril Ihza Mahendra, politician
Hartono Mardjono and ulema Ahmad Sumargono, Abdul Qadir Djaelani
and Kholil Ridwan said Moslems -- the majority in Indonesia's 202
million population --should be allowed to establish an Islamic
party.
	   ``Islam, yes. Islamic party, yes. Don't repeat the mistakes of
the old regime,'' said Sumargono when he addressed a gathering of
around 2,000 at the Al Azhar Grand Mosque here yesterday.
	   ``We welcome those who want to establish Catholic parties,
Christian parties, Secular parties, or whatever, but don't prevent
Moslems from forming an Islamic party because of fear that it would
endanger the nation,'' Sumargono said. ``(The fear) is sign of an
Islamophobia.''
	   He added: ``This line of thought is the remnant of Soeharto's
regime formulated by (thinkers at) the CSIS (Centre for Strategic
and International Studies).
	   ``As long as we uphold the principles of fair play, equality and
honesty, God willing, this nation will not disintegrate.''
	   Sumargono did not comment on the establishment Friday of the
Syarikat Islam Party by members of the Syarikat Islam organization.
In 1973, it had joined with several other Islamic parties to
establish the United Development Party (PPP).
	   Yusril, who also spoke at the gathering, supported the concept
of an Islamic party but urged Moslems not to act hastily.
	   ``Let us think calmly, let us prepare ourselves first.
	   ``Just because people race to build political parties does not
mean that we should go out there and do the same,'' he said.
	   ``Don't be afraid of being left behind or losing the momentum,
because we have the real (political) support, namely the Moslem
majority, because people know what's right from wrong.''
	   He said a party that accommodated the aspirations of Moslems was
a necessity, but Moslem leaders needed to first cooperate and form
a committee to study and prepare further steps to be taken.
	   He called for cooperation between young Moslem leaders with
their seniors such as Jusuf Hasyim from Nahdlatul Ulama or Anwar
Harjono from the Indonesian Council for Islamic Propagation.
	   ``Let us reach a consensus that Moslems would only have one
party, rather than divided into small parties which cannot even win
a seat in the general elections.''
	   He spoke out against any efforts to limit the number of
political parties, and said no matter how many were now
established, a process of natural selection would weed out those
which were worthy from the also-rans.
	   ``Let the people be the judge whether those parties merit their
support. Those which do not win people's trust will dissolve.''
	   Flag
	   In Yogyakarta, Nurcholish Madjid and Mangunwijaya separately
appealed against the forming of religious parties for fear they
would cause unmanageable conflicts.
	   ``I call on the government to issue as soon as possible a clear
directive on the establishment of political parties,'' Nurcholish
told reporters after speaking in a discussion at Gadjah Mada
University.
	   ``I am happy that Pak Amien Rais has disclaimed any intention of
establishing an Islamic political party,'' he said. ``I hope Gus
Dur (Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of the 30 million-strong Nahdlatul
Ulama Moslem organization) will say the same thing soon.
	   ``I hope that even with such a huge following, Gus Dur would not
establish a political party,'' he added.
	   ``If people insist on establishing a party with a religion as
its flag, I am afraid what ensues is disintegration,'' Mangunwijaya
said in a separate discussion at Muhammadiyah headquarters.
	   It was a view echoed by Frans Seda in a discussion in Jakarta
Saturday: ``Religions may motivate our actions, may become the
inspiration for us to select values, but they should not be the
'political flags'.''
	   He called on fellow Catholics to eschew forming a religion-based
political party.
	   ``If we felt we had to establish one, then it should not be
based on religion,'' he was quoted by Antara as saying. ``That
political party should be 'open' in nature and be based on
nationalism and (state ideology) Pancasila.''
	   He endorsed a suggestion of fellow Catholic scholar Astrid S.
Soesanto for the establishment of a party based on human rights.
	   ``That particular party would be good, would be open and able to
accommodate the aspirations of anyone regardless their background.
	   ``We should establish a political party not because we want to
take over the control of the country, but to dedicate ourselves for
the nation.''
	   Rights
	   Yusril reminded the public that it was the people's rights to
assemble and establish their own political parties. But Abdurrahman
instructed NU followers to wait for an edict on the matter from
their leaders.
	   ``Nahdlatul Ulama should maintain its khittah, and not turn into
a political party,'' he said in a written address to a gathering of
NU members in Surabaya, East Java, yesterday.
	   Khittah is the official stance of Nahdlatul Ulama, which is a
social-religious organization and thus barred from involvement in
politics. In reality, however, individual members of Nahdlatul
Ulama, including Abdurrahman, have been prominent movers and
shakers in the political sphere.
	   ``If NU members want to be involved in politics, please wait for
a guidance from the executive board, which will be issued at the
right time,'' Abdurrahman was quoted by Antara as saying.
	   Democracy
	   Prominent economist Faisal Basri noted in a gathering of
students at the Bogor Agriculture Institute in Bogor, West Java,
that the interest of particular groups only should not be behind
the establishment of new parties.
	   In a televised interview, he said people who set up parties
should not do to sate a lust for power. ``The ultimate goal of
politics should be social welfare.''
	   Political analysts J.B. Kristiadi of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies (CSIS) and Indria Samego of the National
Institute of Sciences told The Jakarta Post separately that people
were racing to establish political parties to quench their thirst
for real democracy after the floodgates of free speech had opened.
	   Both agreed the phenomenon was a reasonable release for a people
kept under tight control from political activities for the past 32
years under Soeharto.
	   ``The plug which had been clogging the 'bottle of democracy' for
years is now unplugged,'' Kristiadi said.
	   Kristiadi said the proliferation of new political parties was
also due to failure of the existing three political parties to give
voice to the needs of the people.
	   Since the early 1970s, the government has only recognized the
existence of Golkar, the Moslem-based United Development Party
(PPP) and the Christian-nationalist alliance Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI).
	   Kristiadi argued they were pawns in the game of maintaining the
political status quo.
	   ``These organizations are only designed by the government to
strengthen its power.''

	   THE move by the Construction Industry Development Board to
provide free short-term courses to Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia
students who failed to obtain a place in institutions of higher
learning is commendable and timely.
	   With thousands of SPM holders failing to get a place in local
higher learning institutions, the courses come as a ray of hope for
several hundred students interested in a career in building
construction.
	   Although CIDB can only offer its scholarships to fewer than 500
students, it is still an effort as it will have to spend about
RM3,000 per trainee or about RM150,000 from its own funds.
	   The objective of providing free courses is multi-pronged. The
main intention is to attract SPM school-leavers who have an
interest in building construction but do not have the qualification
to pursue their ambition in higher learning institutions.
	   The second objective is fulfilling its social obligation. By
holding such courses, CIDB would be doing its part in attracting
youths into a sector (building construction) which provides a lot
of job opportunities rather than allowing them to loaf or be
engaged in other unproductive activities.
	   Thirdly, CIDB hopes the course could provide the foundation for
these trainees to pursue higher professional courses related to
building construction, including civil engineering.
	   Finally, CIDB also hopes to build a register of skilled building
construction workers. This will enable the board to become a
reference centre or an employment agency for the construction
sector which could supply skilled workers to contractors.
	   CIDB chief excutive Datuk Abdul Rahman Abdullah said under the
training programme, which is expected to be introduced early next
year, selected students would be trained at six of the Akademi
Binaan Malaysia (ABM) training centres located in Selangor, Perak,
Johor, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak.
	   Trainees would have to go through three to six months of basic
building construction courses. They have a choice of 58 modules,
including how to operate mobile cranes, brick laying and handling
scaffolding.
	   ``The students will be given certificates. With it, the trainees
will have a better chance of securing jobs in the construction
sector. It will also enable them to pursue higher education in
related fields.
	   ``If we do not offer this course, the students will have to seek
jobs in the construction sector first and hope that their employers
will send them for training at ABM later.''
	   At the moment, CIDB accepts employees in the construction
industry for training at ABM. The training fee, ranging from
RM2,000 to RM3,000, is paid by the employers. Those who complete
the course are given competence certificates to acknowledge the
level of professionalism in the respective fields.
	   Although the facilities at the ABM training centres are still
inadequate, they are more than sufficient to meet the requirements
for basic training.
	   In this respect, CIDB is also working closely with other skills
training centres in the country such as the Terengganu Advance
Training Institute in Kemaman and the Terengganu Skills Development
Centre in Kuala Terengganu.
	   ``We need all the help we can. We have to put on hold our plans
to provide tower cranes or other expensive equipment at the ABM
training centres at the moment due to the current economic
situation.
	   ``But this does not mean that we don't have any training
equipment at the ABM training centres. In fact, our plan to
co-operate with skills training centres is aimed at overcoming this
problem in the short term.
	   ``We also plan to provide twinning programmes with local and
foreign higher learning institutions to ensure that our trainees
get the best in skills training.''
	   On paper, the plans by the CIDB look realistic as it involves
the development of manpower from the basic stage to the
professional stage, as well as registration of manpower for the
construction sector.
	   However, to be successful, it has to receive the support of
players in the the construction sector. They could at least share
the cost of providing the training equipment and machines used by
workers.
	   The industry has to realise that what CIDB is doing is for the
sake of the industry, especially in improving the professionalism
and skills of manpower required in the construction sector.
	   With more trained and skilled manpower, industries will no
longer have to look abroad for good workers, reducing foreign
exchange loss. The CIDB will have a registry of local workers that
it can supply to contractors.
	   Another training programme which deserves to be commended is the
one endorsed by the Electricity and Gas Department, which involves
the training of chargemen by industries.
	   Under this programme, the State Economic Planning Unit
shortlists the candidates for training and pays part of the
allowances during the six-month training period.
	   Industries which accept these trainees will provide on-the-job
training and those who excel are given certificates endorsed by the
department.
	   In Terengganu, companies such as Perwaja Steel, Metro Pacific,
Permint Plywood, The New Straits Times Press (M) Berhad, Gunawan
Iron and Steel and the Marang Safari  Resort, have participated in
such training schemes and benefited from them.
	   ``Those who received the certificates but declined the offer to
work with their host companies can easily secure a job as chargeman
in other companies as there are over 5,000 vacancies,'' said
director-general of the department, Datuk Mohd Anas Mohd Nor.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Road Transport Department today said
using the name of a brewery in a Commonwealth Games publicity
campaign on buses and taxis, would not promote drinking.
	   Its director-general Datuk Pahamin Rajab said: ``It is not an
advertisement for alcoholic drinks but just one which carries the
name of the Carlsberg company, which is one of the sponsors of the
Games.
	   ``As you notice, there is no picture of a bottle of Carlsberg or
any word extolling its superiority or that drinking is good,'' he
said, adding that the company also produces non-alcoholic drinks
like Nutrimalt.
	   Personally, Pahamin said he did not think that one would
immediately turn into an alcoholic after looking at the
advertisement.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference called to clarify the
controversy which arose following objections from several quarters,
including the Malaysian Youth Council, over the move by Sukom
Ninety Eight Bhd to collaborate with Carlsberg in promoting the
September Games.
	   Pahamin hoped the issue would not be politicised as the decision
to allow the advertisement did not mean that the Government, RTD,
Sukom or the Youth and Sports Ministry were encouraging people to
drink.
	   Yesterday, Sukom Ninety Eight Bhd executive chairman Tan Sri
Hashim Mohd Ali and Games village mayor Datuk Dr Ibrahim Saad said
the advertisement did not contravene any law as it was aimed more
at promoting the Games and not the company's products.
	   On whether the guidelines on advertisement on commercial
vehicles were vague and needed to be reviewed, Pahamin said
coincidently, a review was expected to be completed within three
months.
	   He said the department planned to turn the guidelines into
rules, which would enable stricter action to be taken against cases
of non-compliance like offenders being slapped with compounds.
	   At present, the department can only direct advertisements on
commercial vehicles to be withdrawn if they fail to follow
procedures.
	   He said views and response from the public and non-governmental
organisations, especially following this latest controversy, would
be considered in the review.
	   On action against Singaporean drivers who failed to settle their
traffic summonses, Pahamin said RTD was studying the best way to
handle the matter.
	   When it was pointed out enforcement could be made more effective
by linking up the RTD computers with those at the Immigration
Department, Pahamin said this would be the ideal solution.
	   However, he said this could not be realised at the moment as the
Immigration Department was not fully computerised yet.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Federal Court will hear on June 29 the
appeal by bomoh couple Maznah Ismail and her husband Mohd Affandi
Abdul Rahman as well as their assistant Juraimi Hussain against the
Court of Appeal decision, dismissing their appeal against their
death sentence for killing a State assemblyman.
	   The Court of Appeal had dismissed their appeal on Oct 24 last
year.
	   They were convicted by the Temerloh High Court for the murder of
Batu Talam State Assemblyman Datuk Mazlan Idris four years ago.
Mazlan's body was cut up into 18 parts.
	   They are taking up their appeal to the Federal Court - their
last chance to escape the gallows - after the Court of Appeal held
that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice in the case.
	   Maznah, 41, better known as Mona Fandey, Mohd Affandi, 39, and
Juraimi, 27, were sentenced to death on Feb 9, 1995.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Anti-Corruption Agency's investigation
of former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib is
still on, ACA director-general Datuk Shafee Yahaya said today.
	   He said the agency had completed the first part of its
investigation which started the moment Muhammad was detained for
failing to declare more than A$1.2 million (RM2.95 million) when he
left Brisbane International Airport on Dec 26, 1996.
	   ``The ACA has been investigating the matter since that day and
this includes going through all his (Muhammad's) accounts and
assets to ascertain the sources of his wealth.
	   ``We have completed parts of it and have submitted the
investigation papers to the Attorney-General's Chamber for a
further directive before proceeding with further action.
	   ``We are still investigating the second part of it and once it's
completed, we will forward the papers to the A-G's Chamber.''
	   However, Shafee declined to comment on the recommendations made
by the ACA to the A-G's Chamber on the matter so far.
	   Although he also declined to elaborate on the two parts of the
ACA investigations, it was reported early last year that the agency
was investigating Muhammad and his two former aides following the
discovery of large amounts of cash in Brisbane and Shah Alam.
	   The ACA started the first investigation following a report
lodged by Pas Youth secretary Mahfuz Omar with the Selangor ACA in
Shah Alam on Dec 29.
	   This came in the wake of an admission by Muhammad that the money
which he failed to declare at the Brisbane airport while en route
to New Zealand belonged to his three brothers - Datuk Raduan, Datuk
Othman and Hassan.
	   The second investigation was connected to the conversion of a
40ha forest area in Bukit Sungai Putih, Hulu Langat, involving
Muhammad's former aides.
	   It was reported that the land was gazetted as a forest reserve
in 1972, but the State Executive Council took a decision in 1990 to
degazette it.
	   The land was originally part of the Bukit Sungai Putih forest
reserve and had been earmarked for mixed development after a
logging licence was given out to a company.
	   It was reported that the ACA would call all parties involved in
the decision-making to give their statements, including Muhammad.
	   The others were State Forestry Department officers and State
Executive Councillors, past and present.
	   One of the two aides was said to be found with about RM1.5
million in his car when an ACA team went to his house in Shah Alam
in December 1996.
	   The ACA commenced investigation into this case following a
report lodged at the ACA headquarters. The complainant was not
named.
	   Yesterday, Muhammad told Malaysian journalists in Brisbane that
he had declared his assets to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad and the ACA after he was detained in Australia.
	   ``The ACA checked our accounts and scrutinised the records and
it is up to them whether to take any action against me,'' he said,
adding whatever he told the ACA was consistent with the evidence in
court.
	   The Brisbane District Court had on Friday, acquitted Muhammad on
two charges of falsely declaring the money he took into Australia
in December 1996 and failing to declare more than A$1.2 million
when he left the country.
	   The money was seized by the Australian police following his
arrest and was released on Friday.
	   During his trial, Muhammad told the court that he had used his
wife's name, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Hasnan, to purchase assets in
Australia and New Zealand.
	   This included a plot of land valued at A$460,000 and a A$460,000
bungalow at Sovereign Island, Gold Coast; a farm in Currajong
valued at A$3.7 million, a NZ$500,000 house (RM1.05 million) and
two plots of land valued at about NZ$4 million in New Zealand.

Argentina seeks contracts under Iraq's U.N. oil deal

Eds: CORRECTS Argentine official's name throughout
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Argentina is seeking contracts to sell Iraq
food items under the U.N. approved oil-for-food deal, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
	   It said a senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, Marcelo
Avogadro, met with Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh on
Monday to discuss ways of expanding bilateral trade.
	   ``The possibility of Argentine companies getting contracts under
the next phase of the oil-for-food deal was reviewed,'' INA said.
	   The deal allows Iraq to sell a limited quantity of oil every six
month to help it overcome shortages caused by U.N. economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq can sell
up to dlrs 5.2 billion worth oil in the latest phase beginning June
3, instead of dlrs 2 billion worth permitted in previous phases.
	   Iraq plans to use dlrs 3 billion for buying food, medicines and
other humanitarian goods from the oil revenue, up from dlrs 1.3
billion it used to spend every six months in the earlier phases of
the deal.
	   INA quoted Avogadro as saying that Argentina want contracts to
supply Iraq with wheat, maize and cooking oil. Avogadro is the
undersecretary for trade relations in his ministry.
	   According to U.N. figures Argentina sold commodities worth dlrs
7 million to Iraq in the past 18 months.

	   JAKARTA (JP): United Development Party (PPP) chairman Ismail
Hasan Metareum said over the weekend that cabinet ministers,
governors and Armed Forces (ABRI) leaders should no longer be
recruited as members of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
	   Addressing the opening of PPP's leadership meeting at the
party's secretariat on Jl. Diponegoro in Central Jakarta, Ismail
said the Assembly, along with the House of Representatives (DPR),
should perform its duties purely as messengers of people's
aspirations and remain free from government intervention.
	   ``The Assembly should be a true representation of the people and
the supreme power controller of the country,'' Ismail, who is
better known as Buya, said Saturday.
	   ``The ministers, Armed Forces commander and others of his rank,
governors and all civil servants should not be MPR members,'' he
asserted.
	   Ismail was referring to PPP's proposal on a revision of the 1985
laws on the structure and position of the MPR and the DPR, on
general elections and on political parties.
	   In the past few years, almost all cabinet ministers and
provincial governors have been members of the Assembly.
	   The Assembly is comprised of 1,000 members. The House with its
500 legislators comprises half of the Assembly, the rest are
appointed by the president.
	   Ismail maintained that apart from the Armed Forces
representatives, all members of the Assembly should be elected.
	   ``The (new) law should at least delineate that all MPR members
are directly elected by the people, except for, perhaps, the Armed
Forces, who are appointed to the DPR with a number that can be
negotiated,'' he said.
	   Because Armed Forces members do not vote in elections, they are
accorded 75 seats in the House.
	   Electoral law
	   Speaking on PPP's proposal for changes in the electoral law,
Ismail said honest and fair should be added to the already existing
four principles of general elections -- direct, general, free and
confidential.
	   He said election supervision should be held by an independent
body consisting of neutral figures, while the government should act
only as a facilitator.
	   He also said that election day should be held on a holiday or
declared a holiday.
	   ``The government apparatus, both civil and military, from middle
level down should not side with any poll contestants,'' he
remarked.
	   Speaking of revisions to the law on political parties, Ismail
said there should be no restrictions on the ability to establish a
political party or for the general public to be affiliated to any
party of their choosing.
	   ``People should also be free not to join any party.
	   ``Civil servants should be free to join and not to join any
political party. They should not need to obtain their superiors'
permission if they want to become party members,'' he added.
	   In the past, civil servants were required by the government to
vote for the dominant Golkar.
	   Speaking to journalists, Ismail said he was not troubled by the
fact that several organizations which merged in 1973 to form the
PPP were now breaking rank and establishing their own parties.
	   ``PPP members are free to join and leave the party as they
please,'' he said, referring to the Indonesian Syarikat Islam Party
(PSII).
	   Syarikat Islam announced Friday that it would go its own way in
the political arena when its chairman Taufiq R. Tjokroaminoto said
it was readopting its old name and forming its own political party.
	   Another PPP element, the Tarbiyah Islamiyah Association (PERTI),
has also indicated a plan to regain its glorious past as an
independent party.
	   Ismail, however, said that the PPP would remain a solid and
unified party despite the withdrawal of several elements.
	   ``PPP is not a federation of organizations, whose individual
organizations can withdraw their membership just like that,'' he
said, ``PPP will remain a merger of four political parties.''
	   As part of the national consensus, four Moslem political parties
--Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), PSII, PERTI and the Indonesian Moslem Party
(Parmusi) -- merged and formed the PPP in 1973.
	   Ismail said the PPP would be unperturbed if Syarikat Islam later
gained government approval to contest general elections.
	   ``If that happens, then we will contest general elections
together,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Health Ministry will intensify its
campaign for more organ donation pledges from Malaysians while
working out legal and ethical issues surrounding the process.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today lack of donors
was hampering the development of an effective national organ
transplantation programme, although the country had the capability
to conduct such ``miracle'' operations.
	   ``We have received more than 10,000 organ donation pledges from
the public, of which more than 8,000 were made through the National
Kidney Foundation and the rest with the Kuala Lumpur Hospital's
Organ Transplantation Resource Centre.
	   ``However, our cadaveric kidney donation rate is still low -
less than 0.5 per million population in Malaysia,'' he said when
opening the Malaysian Society of Transplantation's third annual
meeting at the National Heart Institute.
	   Comparatively, he said, the rate was about 40 per million
population in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Spain and
Portugal, and about 30 per million in the United States and United
Kingdom.
	   Chua said the Ministry's National Transplantation Co-ordination
Committee during a meeting last March 5, had set up five
sub-committees, to handle professional issues, public education,
ethics and law, registration as well as planning and promotion.
	   Chaired by Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman
and supported by professional groups, non-governmental
organisations, universities, private hospitals and religious
groups, the committee will next meet on June 18.
	   Chua said the country had seen 663 local kidney transplants
carried out from 1975 to the end of last year, 25 liver transplants
performed since 1995 and three heart transplants as of April this
year.
	   ``Organ transplants have dramatically improved the quality of
life for end-stage organ failure patients,'' he said, adding that
they freed patients from tedious and expensive treatments such as
dialysis, daily injections and intravenous feeding.
	   However, he said the Government would strive to ensure donated
organs do not become a commodity here as opposed to how organ
transplants have become a commercial activity in certain countries.
	   Chua said information of potential donors would eventually be
forwarded to Kuala Lumpur Hospital to be compiled in a centralised
database, to prevent the organ donation process from experiencing
``hiccups.''
	   On rumours that Viagra pills were available in Malaysia, Chua
advised the public to be careful as the pills being sold locally
were probably fake and could have harmful effects.
	   He said the Pharmaceutical Services Division was compiling
information about the drug, which is reported to address the
problem of impotence but is not yet registered in Malaysia.
	   He said if and when Viagra was to be registered, it would only
be dispensed by prescription, enabling the physician to monitor the
patient's condition as well as any other medication he might be
taking.

Norwegian Coach: ``Brazil not as good as FIFA ranking'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Brazil is a hot favorite to win their fifth
World Cup title in France, but Norwegian Coach Egil ``Drillo''
Olsen said Monday there is a chance the defending champions would
not make it to the second round.
	   ``Brazil is not as good as the FIFA ranking suggests, and it is
not unlikely that they will be beaten by two of the teams in Group
A. But I don't think that will happen,'' Olsen said.
	   Brazil tops FIFA's ranking, Norway is seventh.
	   Brazil opens the World Cup against Scotland on June 10.
	   In May 1997, Olsen's team stunned the soccer world by beating
Brazil 4-2 in Oslo.
	   Olsen's concern now is Norway's Group A opener against Morocco
on June 10.
	   ``Morocco is not going to be a push over. I was impressed when
Morocco held France to a draw. However, England was a
disappointment in their scoreless tie against Belgium,'' he said.

	   DESPITE discouraging retail sales, Japanese department store
Isetan is opening a five-floor outlet at the newly-opened Suria
Kuala Lumpur City Centre shopping mall.
	   Even in these gloomy times, this flagship store aspires to be
international in its outlook, offering ``a total lifestyle
experience'' to trendsetting 20 to 34-year-olds.
	   From fashion and accessories, household and food to books and
stationery, Isetan says it believes in ``celebrating the individual
and offering something for everyone in every aspect of their
lives.''
	   Among the interesting labels to look out for, which
unfortunately are rather pricey, are funky fashion by New
York-based Korean designer Anna Sui, Alberta Ferretti's Philosophy
from Milan, Lawrence Steel from London and Hackett. Other leading
labels available are Donna Karan's DKNY, Gianni Versace's Versus,
Calvin Klein's cK and Polo Ralph Lauren.
	   Joining these notable names are the store's in-house brands like
Gillian Hung, Total Women, Crescendo, Cicada, City, Generation X
and Cultivation.
	   One of the sought-after names in professional make-up, Bobbi
Brown, has set up a reasonably big counter in the store's cosmetics
section. Brown, whose make-up principle is about looking pretty,
naturally has a cult following worldwide. But Brown's beauty comes
with a price - it's said that her stick foundation sells at US$30
each in America.
	   Another big name is professional skincare and bodycare brand
Biotherm from France. It is said to be between 10 and 15 per cent
cheaper than a leading American label, one of its main rivals.
	   With five floors covering 77,000 square metres of retail space,
Isetan KLCC is twice the size of its Lot 10 store in Jalan Sultan
Ismail, Kuala Lumpur.
	   Ladies' apparel is on the concourse floor, designer boutiques,
sundries and cosmetics are on the ground floor while men's wear,
sundries and sportswear can be found on the first floor.
	   On the second floor, there are a variety of items like
children's apparel, jewellery, watches, optical articles, gifts,
books and stationery. At the top level, the third floor, shoppers
will find the supermarket and household items. Having this section
on the top floor is unique to Isetan since its survey showed that
customers usually shop in this department last.
	   Shoppers are offered services such as alterations, laundry, gift
wrapping, photo processing and a duty-free shop.
	   Facilities include a golf practice range, nursery room as well
as The Gallery on the first floor which promotes local artwork.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Seven Malaysians, part of a 21-man crew
onboard a Malaysian-registered ship, Petro Ranger, sailed home
yesterday, about a month after the vessel was detained by Chinese
authorities in connection with an alleged pirate attack in the
South China Sea.
	   The fuel tanker was held at the Haikou Port since it was
intercepted by the Chinese maritime authorities on April 26.
	   Following the vessel's release, the Malaysians and other crew
members left the port in Hainan island for Singapore about 4pm.
	   The Malaysians crew members were identified as Saravanan
Subramanian, Mohamed Nazri Selamat, Abdul Kadir Soad, Sani Anak
Ugie, Mohd Faizal Mohd Ghazali, Mohd Shizul Khan M. Razali and Mohd
Samsuri Abdul Kadir.
	   The other crew onboard the vessel were six Indonesians, four
Bangladeshies, a Ghanaian, a Filipino, a Myanmar and the ship's
captain, Kenneth Blyth, an Australian.
	   Chinese authorities reported they had detained a gang of 12
Indonesians - believed to have boarded the vessel off the coast of
China -in connection with the hijack of the ship to smuggle its
cargo into the country.
	   When contacted at his office in Beijing today, Malaysian
Ambassador to China, Datuk Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan, said the ship
and the crew set sail for Singapore yesterday.
	   ``All the crew aboard the vessel, including the Malaysians, were
released by the Chinese authorities,'' he said.
	   The International Maritime Bureau had sought the assistance of
the Malaysian Embassy after the bureau's officials and the ship's
agent, Petroships of Singapore, were denied access to board the
vessel.
	   The crew members were also barred from leaving the vessel
although they were allowed to post letters to their families,
through the embassy.
	   On April 16, the Petro Ranger disappeared during a voyage from
Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam after it was alleged to
have come under pirate attack.
	   It was transporting 11,000 tonnes of diesel and kerosene when
the incident occurred.
	   Meanwhile, Petroships of Singapore's maritime superintendent,
Capt Johnny Liew, when contacted in Singapore, said Petro Ranger
was expected to arrive in the republic by the middle of next week.
	   He said the 12 Indonesians, arrested by the Chinese authorities,
were being held to assist in the probe.

	   SAMARINDA, East Kalimantan: After the forest fires, the
200,000-hectare Kutai National Park is now facing a new threat: a
coal mining company is to exploit the lowland rain forest reserve
area.
	   The Environmental Impact Management Agency's provincial head,
Awang Farouk Ishak, said PT Tambang Damai Mining has secured a
license to exploit some 100,000 hectares of the park.
	   ``We have a real headache now because there have been at least
three mining companies allowed to operate in the area,'' Awang
said, reported Antara.
	   Awang said the companies, PT Indominco Mining and PT Traco
Mining, are currently still in the exploration and survey stage.
	   According to Awang, Indomico's concession area is 14,000
hectares, while 35,000 hectares of Traco's is in the Kutai National
Park.
	   From early this year until early May, as much as 75,000 hectares
of the park were ravaged in fires.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Consumers International today criticised the
Codex Food Labelling Committee, a body of the United Nations Codex
Alimentarius Commission that sets food standards, for failing to
ensure labelling of genetically engineered food.
	   It said the four-day committee meeting held in Ottawa, Canada,
that ended today was important to consumer organisations concerned
about such food in the world market.
	   Its regional director for Asia and Pacific, Josie Fernandez said
this meant that much of the genetically modified food sold in
supermarkets would not have to be labelled as such.
	   Genetic engineering can change nutritional value or create
problems that offend religious obligations, she said.
	   She said, for example, Muslims could not eat lamb or other food
products containing pig genes and vegetarians wanted to know
whether such food contained genes from animals and Hindus would
want to ascertain whether they contained genes of cows.
	   Josie said most consumers would certainly want to know if human
genes were used in any of the food they ate.
	   ``In this context, the Malaysian Ministry of Health needs to
state the actions being taken with regard to inter/cross-splicing
of animal, human, virus, bacteria and plant genes into various
food, crops, and drugs.''

Mir computer working again steering system.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The central computer on board Mir was working
again Monday night, after a three-day breakdown that threatened to
postpone the Russian space station's last rendezvous with a U.S.
shuttle.
	   That enabled the Mir crew to begin the long process of
reactivating the station's automatic steering system, said Valery
Lyndin, a spokesman for Russian Mission Control. The shuttle can
only dock with Mir when the steering system keeps it properly
aligned.
	   The space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift off Tuesday and
dock with the station Friday to pick up astronaut Andrew Thomas,
the seventh and last American to live on the Russian outpost.
	   Lyndin said space officials have not yet determined why Mir's
computer broke down on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin replaced it with another unit, but
the new unit failed on Sunday when they tried to switch it on.
	   Ground controllers fully loaded the software into the computer
Monday night, and the crew was able to get it working again within
about 90 minutes. Reactivating the steering system can take an
entire day.
	   During a chat with ground controllers during the repair process,
Musabayev said the situation on board ``isn't bad'' but added that
he was concerned that it occurred on the eve of the shuttle's
launch. ``I'm worried not for myself, but for the flight program,''
he said.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a shuttle ferry flight
in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months of
trouble-free operation. The station's crew has replaced it with a
back-up computer brought up by a Russian cargo ship.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply is
threatened because it can't keep its solar panels in optimum
alignment with the sun.
	   Depending on how much energy was lost, it can take from one to
three days to get the orientation system fully on-line.
	   Fortunately, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was
on the so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight
round the clock. As a result, the Mir's solar panels have remained
in full sunlight.
	   The crew also shut down some systems to save energy, and as a
result Mir's batteries were full on Monday, making it easier for
the crew to restore the orientation system, Lyndin said.
	   Russia plans to bring down the 12-year-old Mir at the end of
1999 after the first parts of the international space station are
in orbit.
	   A Russian-manufactured propulsion system, is supposed to be
launched in November. But Russia's contributions to the station
have been delayed repeatedly because of financial problems.
	   A service module for the station to be supplied by Russia is
nearly ready for testing, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   A satellite communications system and a computer will be
installed in the module before it is sent to the Baikonur launch
site in Kazakstan, where it will be launched in April of next year,
the report said.

More deaths reported in Kosovo; thousands flee

Eds: UPDATES with scene in Tropoja, refugee quotes; trims

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Refugees from Serbia's Kosovo
province streamed into neighboring Albania in unprecedented numbers
on Monday amid reports of dozens of people killed and some trapped
by the worst fighting in months.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend, and fighting
apparently continuing, the bloodshed seemed the worst since early
March, when Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on independence-minded militants and their families.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of some Kosovo Albanian villages near the
border to Albania. He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars
being fired into the villages.
	   Refugees talking to The Associated Press on the Albanian side of
the border said one three-year old had died on the way and that
they had heard second hand of infants inadvertently suffocated by
parents who had covered their mouths and noses to stop them from
crying and giving away their location to Serb forces.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians had been killed over
the weekend. Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were
killed when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of the regional capital Pristina, Serb
sources said.
	   The latest fierce fighting prompted about 2,000 Kosovo Albanians
to leave the troubled region and cross over into Albania's Tropoja
(pronounced Tro-POH-yah) region Sunday and Monday, Albanian
authorities said. They said more were arriving by the hour.
	   In Tropoja, some of the hundreds of refugees in the town itself
_ most of them old, young or women _ said they had walked for up to
20 hours to reach the Albanian town. They said Serb tanks were
positioned inside Decani, and said some of the Serb forces
besieging the town wore black uniforms.
	   Tropoja, although some 5 kilometers (3 miles) inside Albanian
territory, resembled a community under siege, with most of the men
carrying rifles or other weapons.
	   Some of them displayed the insignia of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the militant Kosovo organization spearheading the fight
against Serbia.
	   Andrew Harper, the representative of the main U.N. refugee
agency, said he had purchased three tons of flour, rice and other
basics on the local market to provide for the refugees, and more
aid was expected from Tirana, the Albanian capital, on Tuesday.
	   Still, some questioned if it would be enough.
	   ``I am very worried about providing for all these people,'' said
Isa Memia, the town leader. ``We have grave (supply) problems
ourselves, but they are our kinsmen, and we will help them.''
	   Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, called the refugee flow ``the
largest such exodus to date.''
	   He said that 1,300 people fled to Tropoja town on Sunday alone
and cited reports that some people were ``trapped and cannot cross
the border.''
	   Refugees already in Tropoja said about 1,000 more were still on
the Kosovo side of the border hills and were expected to cross
Tuesday.
	   In a statement, the Albanian government called on the United
States and the European Union to intervene to end ``the massacre in
Kosovo.''
	   Authorities in Serbia, which with Montenegro comprises all that
remains of the Yugoslav federation, are trying to block Kosovo's
independence bid. They are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   More than 200 people have died in Kosovo clashes since the
beginning of March. An estimated 50 percent of the Serbian province
is controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked
off, either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina. It said one had had his
throat slit.
	   According to the Albanians' account, Serb police burst into
Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to ``go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   All phone lines remained disconnected Monday between Pristina
and the hot-spots of Decani, Klina and Djakovica. In Pristina,
about 10,000 ethnic Albanians, including 2,000 children, marched to
protest Serbian rule.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Selangor Waterworks Department today
said it would further improve the water distribution process under
the current rationing scheme to ensure supply reached everyone.
	   ``We will try to do this by opening valves to higher areas first
before opening those to the low-lying areas,'' said the
department's deputy director V. Subramaniam during a Press
conference at the department headquarters.
	   As a result, he urged people who do not receive water through
their pipes continuously to report the matter to the department so
that it could rectify the situation.
	   Subramaniam said although this would create a lot more work for
his staff, who were already stretched to the limit, the move was
necessary to ensure that everyone got their supply.
	   Such adjustments have been successfully implemented for
residents in Bukit Gasing and Puchong Jaya in Selangor, who are now
getting water as scheduled.
	   Besides valve manipulation, Subramaniam said repairing broken
and leaking pipes could also help increase the efficiency of water
supply.
	   He said the department had managed to improve its response time
to reports of damaged pipes.
	   He said the public should not damage the department's
installations or use more water than necessary because this might
prevent areas on higher grounds from getting water.
	   ``Unlike electricity, water takes time to travel when the valves
are opened. Low lying areas will have to be satisfied first,
including filling up all the pails and tanks, before it moves to
higher ground.''
	   Subramaniam also said the levels at the Semenyih and Langat dams
had dropped further as water had been released to maintain water
production at the Sungai Semenyih, Sungai Langat, Cheras and Ampang
intake treatment plants at 70 per cent.
	   ``We will keep monitoring the situation and will inform the
public of any decisions.''
	   Subramaniam said the department was still considering the steps
to be taken under the contingency plan if the water levels at the
dams fell to ``critical''.
	   ``We are looking at other options besides just cutting down the
rationing hours,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Selangor State Information and Information Technology
Committee chairman Datuk Sharif Jajang, said the forum to be held
on June 3 would only create more confusion over the issue among the
public. The seminar was organised by the Federation of Malaysian
Consumers Associations on the water crisis Sharif, who is also the
Industry and Investments Committee chairman, said the public
already had adequate information on the facts of the water problem
and as a result, need not attend the forum.
	   ``This is especially so when the Selangor State Government,
Selangor Waterworks Department and Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd are not
attending the forum,'' he said at the same Press conference.
	   He said all three parties were not attending although Fomca had
claimed that the representatatives of the three parties and Indah
Water Konsortium Sdn Bhd would attend the forum.
	   He said the department would meet with Fomca on June 2 to
discuss issues relating to the water problems and seek ways in
which the organisation could help under present circumstances.

	   PADANG, West Sumatra: High tides hitting two coastal villages in
Padang Utara over the past 10 days have left at least 400 people
homeless.
	   Most of the villagers of Ujung Karang and Lolong have been
forced to take shelter with relatives in the safest nearby areas,
Antara reported.
	   Padang Mayor Zuiyen Rais said 110 houses were destroyed,
paralyzing the local economy in the villages. There was no
immediate report of casualties.
	   ``The coastal areas of Padang are vulnerable to such incidents.
It's a natural condition of the area, and during a certain season,
high tides come,'' he said.
	   The mayor said local villagers had been urged many times to move
out but they insist on staying.
	   Zuiyen said his administration has provided 200 kilograms of
rice relief to the villagers.

	   Soepardi told The Jakarta Post yesterday that those serving time
on the island have been charged with ``pretty heavy crimes'', such
as being involved in an armed rebellion in Lampung.
	   However, he did not close the possibility of it happening,
especially under the current climate of reform.
	   But there is still no indication from the Ministry of Justice,

Reformist triumphs in Montenegro poll

Eds: UPDATES with near final results confirming Djukanovic victory.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a major electoral triumph,
Montenegro's reformist president threw down a challenge to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic Monday that could dent or ultimately
undo the strongman's rule.
	   In true Balkan style, supporters of President Milo Djukanovic
fired guns, waved flags and honked car horns as they showed their
joy at an unexpectedly decisive win over Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic in Sunday's parliamentary elections,
	   With 99.7 percent of the vote counted for the 78-seat
Montenegrin parliament, Djukanovic's coalition ''For a Better
Life'' had secured 49.5 percent of ballots cast, the State Election
Commission said.
	   Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party had 36.1 percent, the
Commission added.
	   A jubilant Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters he hoped to
build on the triumph and use it to spread democracy throughout
Yugoslavia, which now consists of just Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,'' he
said.
	   Although this mountainous republic has just 630,000 residents,
it supplies the same number of deputies to the federal Yugoslav
parliament as Serbia, with 10 million inhabitants.
	   Djukanovic and his aides are determined to stack Montenegro's
bloc with their supporters, and hope to team up with Serbian
opposition deputies to vote Milosevic out.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
strongman has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic and unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo
recently have weakened his grip.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians fighting for independence appear to
be gaining ground in ever more deadly battles with Serbian police.
	   Djukanovic first threw down the gauntlet in the winter of
1996-7, coming out against Milosevic during massive protests
against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin then narrowly beat Bulatovic _ his
former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office last January.
	   The strength of his triumph in Sunday's elections could hand him
a majority in the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament. Besides
Djukanovic's and Bulatovic's parties, only one other party _ the
Montenegrin separatist Liberal Alliance _ passed the 3 percent vote
threshold needed to get seats.
	   Djukanovic aides suggested Monday that they would insist on
Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic maneuvered
his protege into that office two weeks ago after the previous
premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western reforms.
	   The big unknown Monday was Milosevic's reaction. Typically in
such situations, he bides his time, allowing media or political
aides to speak for him before acting.
	   The state news agency Tanjug said that Bulatovic's party had
accepted Sunday's results.
	   Some 120 election monitors dispatched by the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation concluded Sunday's ballot
``was generally well conducted,'' an OSCE statement said.
	   ''I'm giving these elections a clean bill of health,'' said
Javier Ruperez of Spain, heading the monitoring team.
	   The statement urged all political parties to overcome the bitter
divisions of the election campaign and ``work now at establishing a
climate of dialogue and confidence.''
	   Media control has proven critical for all ruling parties since
the old Yugoslavia, of six republics, began its bloody break-up in
1991.
	   OSCE said Montenegrin state media were biased toward Djukanovic.
But the transatlantic organization was even more critical of
Serbian state media for its vicious attacks on the Montenegrin
president during the campaign.

	   SEREMBAN, Fri. - Pupils of SK King George V became a privileged
lot when they received 50 copies of the New Straits Times in
conjunction with the Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Future Grads contest.
	   The school was among those selected to be the recipient of
copies of the NST, the official newspaper for the contest.
	   KLMF Seremban senior branch manager Chooi Chan Yen handed over
the newspapers to the senior assistant of the school, Maria Teoh,
and her Standard Five and Six pupils at the school.
	   ``The contribution will encourage the younger generation to get
into the habit of reading English newspapers so that they can have
a better command of the language,'' he said.
	   The school's English teacher Caroline Wood said her pupils had
shown keen interest in taking part and more than 200 of them had
asked for the entry forms.
	   ``This contest would enrich the pupils' knowledge and keep up
with the latest news,'' she said, adding that the contest would
also help them to improve their English.
	   Also present were KLMF Seremban group agency manager Lee Ban
Chuan and NST circulation executive Asim Mohamed.
	   Under the contest, three questions on mathematics and science,
history, geography, sports, entertainment and current affairs will
be printed in the newspapers together with the contest form.
	   Participants must answer all 15 questions and write a slogan.
	   Twelve participants will be selected for the finals to be held
at the Subang Parade shopping complex in Subang Jaya on July 5.

	   JOHOR BARU, Fri. - The Johor Welfare Department has launched an
internal investigation into allegations that one of its senior
officers in charge of an all-women's welfare home had sexually
molested several inmates.
	   State Welfare director Mohd Kodri Omar said today that at least
two mentally-disabled inmates of the Rumah Taman Sinar Harapan in
Jalan Datin Halimah had reported that they had been fondled and
molested by the man in his office on several occasions.
	   The officer has been temporarily seconded to the department's
headquarters, pending the completion of the investigation.
	   Kodri said the investigation into the allegations was headed by
his deputy, Haron Mohd Isa, adding that a team would also question
other inmates to ascertain if there were more allegations of sexual
abuse.
	   The New Straits Times has learnt that the allegations came to
light after the two inmates had complained to a staff at the home,
early this month.
	   Recently, the home's Visitor's Board held a special meeting to
discuss the allegations of sexual abuse.
	   Rumah Taman Sinar Harapan was set up in the 1950s by the Federal
Government.
	   It has today more than 250 female inmates housed in about 20
dormitories.
	   It houses physically and mentally-handicapped girls and women
who have been abandoned by their families.
	   It also houses normal babies, children and teenagers, including
orphans, the children of illegal immigrants and divorced parents.
	   The home also takes in children whose parents are serving prison
sentences.
	   Asked why a male warden was in charge of an all-female
institution, Kodri said that there was no specific policy stating
that the position had to be held by a woman.
	   ``The idea is probably that the girls would benefit from having
a father figure in their lives,'' he added.
	   Kodri said that the department had not lodged a police report or
sent the alleged victims for a medical examination because it had
not completed its investigation of the case.
	   He added, however, that the investigations should be completed
soon.
	   In a related development, State Unity, Women's Affairs and
Social Welfare Commitee chairman Halimah Sadique has promised a
thorough investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse and
that there would be no cover-up.
	   ``If the allegations are found to be true, the officer concerned
will be brought to book,'' Halimah added.

	   THERE is no escaping them. Like a modern-day ``virus'', they are
virtually everywhere.
	   Shopping complexes, bus stops and taxi stands, inside LRT
trains, along the highways and byways. They leap at you, envelop
you and even if you don't pause for a second look, they insidiously
wend their way into your mind.
	   These are the posters - undoubtedly the most powerful tool of
publicity, persuasion and propaganda in modern times, since Jules
Cheret created the first four-colour posters in the late 19th
century! Not meant to last, the posters have become one of the
greatest signposts of the times with many of the more memorable
images assuming iconic status.
	   Some of the greatest original posters of all times are featured
in The Power of the Poster exhibition at London's Victoria and
Albert Museum in South Kensington, on until July 26.
	   With a broad overview reflecting the social history of the last
120 years, the exhibition is neatly arranged under three categories
- Pleasure and Leisure, Protest and Propaganda, and Commerce and
Communication.
	   The 300 posters on display are culled from the museum's own
extensive collection of more than 10,000 original posters, and this
exhibition is the most ambitious of its scale since 1931.
	   The great appeal of posters is their effectiveness, their
incredible outreach and mobility, and economy of production.
	   They also reflect the changes in styles from Art Nouveau, Art
Deco, Bauhaus and Russian Constructivism to the '60s psyche delia
and Pop.
	   The exhibition includes posters of Oskar Kokoschka, David
Hockney, Richard Hamilton (This Is Tomorrow exhibition at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1965); Roy Lichtenstein (Crak! Now, Mes
Petits ... Pour La France!, 1963), and Keith Haring.
	   They are invaluable publicity for the latest plays, operas,
concerts, even movies.
	   Famous music posters include the album cover of punk rockers Sex
Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks by Jamie Reid and John Varnam
(1977) and Martin Sharp's Mister Tambourine Man (1967).
	   As propaganda, they have inspired revolutions, evoked
nationalist fervour and boosted conscriptions.
	   Savile Lumley's Daddy, What did YOU do in the Great War? is both
an appeal to the conscience and national pride as well as a biting
ridicule of the draft dodgers.
	   Fougasse's Careless Talk Costs Lives brings home the importance
of secrecy to overcome the enemy.
	   Posters from the Bolshevik Revolution in the Soviet Union,
American anti-war protests in Vietnam, the suffragette movement,
``ban the bomb''
	   campaign, the overthrow of Communism in Eastern Europe in
1989-90 have become key documents of some of the most tumultuous
events of this century.
	   Tomosz Sarnecki's High Noon 4 June 1989 election poster for
Solidarity marks the political turning point in the former Eastern
bloc enclave.
	   There's also Ron Haeberie's photograph of the massacre with dead
bodies strewn along a footpath with the terse captions: Q. And
Babies? A. And Babies.
	   Campaigns against VD and AIDS exhort machismo restraint or at
least discreet precaution.
	   The ubiquitous posters are also dominant in sports for
mega-events such as the Olympics and the World Cup.
	   One impressive work is that on mercurial former Manchester
United striker Eric Cantona. Done with a twist when most Britons
would be thinking of England wresting the World Cup, it says: ```66
was a great year for English football. Eric was born.''
	   Posters are at their most sophisticated in advertising. Some of
the most provocative involve the Wonderbra and of course,
Benetton's controversial and exploitative slew of confrontational
realism.
	   Besides Cheret, other big names in poster designs featured
include the Beggarstaffs (Don Quixote, 1895), Frank Brangwyn,
Cassandre (exponent of Art Deco), Ludwig Hohlwein, Tom Purvis,
Graham Sutherland, and McKnight Kauffer.
	   To mark the exhibition, a two-day conference, Posters:
Persuasion and Subversion, will be held at the museum on June
12-13.
	   For more information, visit the museum's website at
http://www.vam.ac.uk The exhibition is open Tuesdays to Sundays
from 10am to 5.45pm, and Mondays from noon to 5.45pm.

Soccer surprise at Roland Garros 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ While rising Russian star Marat Safin played his
fourth-round match on center court, he was being watched by a
superstar _ Ronaldo, the Brazilian soccer sensation.
	   What's more, Ronaldo was briefly joined by the teen queen of the
French Open, Anna Kournikova, who lost earlier in the day.
	   After a few games, Kournikova kissed Ronaldo on the cheek and
left.
	   It didn't take long for the crowd to notice the soccer star on
the steps of the dignitaries box. They started chanting Ronaldo's
name during the changeover.
	   Though Safin had just lost the first set, he managed a big smile
and a thumbs-up to Ronaldo.
	   ``I'd never seen Ronaldo that close before.''
  ___  
	   GUGA: Last year's winner, Gustavo Kuerten, also looked in on
Ronaldo at center court. The audience had some trouble spotting
Guga under his new dreadlocks.
	   Kuerten had said: ``If I win the tournament, I'll get
dreadlocks.'' Even though he lost to Marat Safin in the second
round, the idea had already taken hold.
	   Guga followed up on his vow. He got his dreadlocks at the
exclusive Jacques Dessanges salon at Roland Garros, where players
can get free haircuts.
  ___  
	   ANTI-WILLIAMS BANDWAGON: No. 10 women's seed Iva Majoli jumped
on the anti-Williams bandwagon Monday when she was asked about the
match between Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Serena Williams.
	   Sanchez Vicario won that match, and said afterward she was upset
at Williams' attitude. Sanchez Vicario accused the 16-year-old
Williams of not showing respect for her opponent.
	   ``Serena and Venus have their own attitude,'' Majoli said of the
Williams sisters. ``They're like, `Yeah, we're the best' ... I'm
sure it's going to change in a year or two when they grow up.''
  ---  
	   MASHED POTATOES: Hicham Arazi from Morocco beat Alberto
Berasategui on Monday in a match in which most serves stayed under
150 kph (93 mph) for both players, unusually slow for the top men.
	   When asked how his serve measures up, Arazi had some dietary
tips for his questioners.
	   ``I'm able to serve more than 150. I even reached 201 kph (125
mph) at one occasion. I've never been above 150? I can't believe
it,'' he said. ``I'll need to eat more mashed potatoes tonight to
catch up on muscles.''

BOI offers franchise for oil spill products, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   A PENANG-based environment research and development
multinational is offering franchise opportunities to local
companies in the various States for its waste water treatment
systems and oil spill remediation products and technology.
	   The opportunity is being offered to companies - especially
Bumiputera ones - involved in environmental protection,
engineering, health or safety.
	   BOI Technology Holding Sdn Bhd executive group managing director
and chairman Dr Lothar K. Luensmann said no franchising fee would
be imposed although a ``minimal'' royalty based on the company's
level of expertise would be charged.
	   The new system would be offered through BOI's technical
subsidiary BOI Engineering Sdn Bhd for the company's Biodegradable
Oil Interceptor (BOI) product, BOI Treatment Unit and Biological
Integrated Oil Spill Combat Tool and Recycling System.
	   ``We feel the environment issue in Malaysia is fast becoming a
crucial one which must be addressed by Malaysians and not
foreigners.
	   ``It is our opinion that the involvement of local companies is
the most effective way of transferring the latest technology and
distributing our products to strategic areas,'' he told the New
Straits Times.
	   ``The existence of fully-equipped, localised response units,
operated by trained specialists will increase each State's capacity
to respond to oil spills and provide effective treatment of oily
waste,'' added Leunsmann.
	   BOI is believed to be the first Malaysian MNC involved in
environmental issues to make this kind of offer to local companies.
	   The company was set up by a group of German and American
investors in 1995 with a paid-up capital of RM5 million.
	   It is a locally-registered holding company with four subsidaries
in research and development, environmental engineering and
manufacture of environmentally-friendly products.
	   BOI Technology director Datuk Arni Lampam said the resources
available would be mobilised in the event of a major oil spill.
	   ``The BOI equipment made available through the franchise system
is suitable to combat small and large-scale oil spills both
on-shore and off-shore, for the treatment of industrial oily waste
in compliance with ISO 14000 and Department of Environment
regulations,'' he added.

Bhd (Attention: Business Development Committee), Suite 9.05, 9th

Allow EPF members to invest more in unit trust funds, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

<TEXT>
	   LAST Wednesday's report that the Employees' Provident Fund might
declare a lower dividend this year is not exactly good news to its
over seven million members.
	   Coming in the wake of last year's dividend of 6.7 per cent, the
report, which cited Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Affifuddin
Omar as saying the EPF dividend payout this year might be affected
by lower returns from its stock market investments adds more gloom
to contributors who perceive their retirement nest-egg shrivelling.
	   That gloom would be laced with pangs of frustration as members
are painfully aware that savings in financial institutions yield
much higher returns. Fixed deposits with finance companies for
periods longer than a year earn more than 12 per cent per annum.
Even commercial banks are providing interest as much as 10 per cent
for one-month fixed deposits.
	   Just as every cloud has a silver lining, EPF has provided that
silver lining to its members to seek higher returns on their EPF
savings but at their own risk.
	   In 1996, the Fund introduced the Members Investment Savings
Scheme that enables members to withdraw a portion of their savings
to invest in approved unit trusts.
	   As all EPF members know by now, savings with the Fund are
trifurcated into three accounts. Account I, which is for
retirement, captures 60 per cent of all savings. It is from this
account that contributors can withdraw to invest in unit trusts.
	   But members must have more than RM50,000 in Account I to be
eligible to withdraw for investment. Even then, contributors can
only take out 20 per cent of the amount, in multiples of RM1,000,
that is in excess of RM50,000 in the account. Simply phrased,
members must have at least RM55,000 in Account I to be eligible to
withdraw the minimum of RM1,000 under the scheme.
	   Which brings us to the logical question: how many among EPF
contributors have RM100,000 or more in savings? The Fund, however,
has never been keen to reveal any statistics. What we do have is a
relatively old set of statistics on the savings profile of members
as at the end of 1994.
	   Those figures show about 33 per cent of 3.8 million active
contributors had more than RM100,000 in savings with the EPF. At
the other end of the scale more than 100,000 members have more than
RM1 million in savings with the Fund.
	   These statistics are not very significant to the primary aspect
of this article, which is simply: how many EPF members have, so
far, availed themselves of the the latest benefit provided by the
Fund?
	   Inquiries with three of the 30 approved unit trust managers
reveal the response has been ``encouraging.''
	   Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Bhd, which manages 10 unit trusts, has
so far attracted RM250 million from EPF members.
	   OSK-UOB Bhd, which launched two unit trusts, has also secured
funds from EPF members, though not in the scale of KL Mutual Fund
which is the largest private unit trust managers in the country.
	   Another fund manager, who declined to be named, expressed
similiar views saying that it has attracted ``several millions''
from EPF members.
	   These facts show that many members invest a portion of their
savings in approved unit trusts. And a salient fact is that these
members are willing to take the risk of transfering their savings
in EPF to unit trusts in these difficult times.
	   But they know that investing in unit trusts would yield higher
returns than EPF could possibly declare. For instance, Permodalan
Nasional Bhd, one of the approved fund managers in the EPF savings
investment scheme, which manages the Amanah Saham Bumiputera has
consistently declared dividends above 12 per cent. Even in the
worst year, so far, in 1997, it gave 11.8 per cent.
	   KL Mutual Fund, for another, has a distinguished record of
providing an average of 10 per cent dividend on its income
generating unit trusts over the last 30 years. Even late-comer,
OSK-UOB is investing 72 per cent of the RM10 million it has so far
attracted in fixed deposits that would yield 10 per cent or more in
interest.
	   Clearly then, EPF's savings investment scheme can increase the
quantum of members' retirement nest-egg. But the amount they could
invest in unit trusts, under current rules is relatively paltry.
	   So the question is why should the Fund place a 20 per cent cap
on the amount members could transfer to unit trusts. In drawing up
this scheme, EPF realised that members who have substantial savings
are mature enough to decide how their monies should be invested.
	   The Fund has realised that despite its huge resources, it cannot
give even the eight per cent dividend it once declared over four
years in the early 90s. Since then the dividends has been 7.5 per
cent (1995), 7.7 per cent (1996) and 6.7 per cent (1997).
	   Surely then, EPF should allow members who have substantial
savings in the fund to withdraw as much money as they can to
substantiate their retirement nest-egg.
	   Let them withdraw the total amount they have in excess of
RM50,000 in Account I. The returns on investments in unit trusts
will then truly be significant.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Filipino singer Rafael M. Centenera was
acquitted by the Sessions Court today on two counts of raping a
15-year-old girl without his defence being called.
	   Judge Lim Yee Lan said there were material contradictions and
inconsistencies in the evidence given by the victim and her mother.
	   She said even if the victim was a credible witness, there was no
corroboration to support her evidence on the sexual intercourse and
identity of the accused.
	   Lim said the prosecution also failed to prove the ingredients of
the alleged offences, including the girl's age, the dates and facts
of the alleged incidents.
	   Centenera, 50, was charged with raping the girl, also a Filipino
who is now 17, at his residence in Forum Condominium Apartment,
Jalan Inai, off Jalan Tun Razak, about 4pm in June, 1996, and in
Room 503, Golden Asean Hotel, Jalan Pudu, at 12.30pm on July 10,
1996.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Journalists from the banned newsweeklies Tempo and
DeTik have seized on rejuvenated freedoms of expression by
announcing their intention of reestablishing the publications
despite financial constraints.
	   DeTik, published in tabloid format, may be back on newsstands
within two weeks. Tempo magazine is expected to republish in a
revised format in six months.
	   Former general manager of DeTik Eros Djarot said the tabloid was
set to be back in business within a fortnight even without a
publication license.
	   ``We had planned to (hit the streets) on Wednesday (June 3) but
there are still legal matters to take care of,'' Eros told The
Jakarta Post Saturday.
	   Republishing without a license, Eros said, ``is a witness to our
consistent stand to advocate the freedom of the press, that no
power can tear us (DeTik) apart''.
	   Eros said he hoped the plans could be realized around June 10.
	   Goenawan Mohamad, the former chief editor of Tempo, conceded it
would not be easy to start up the magazine again in the economic
crisis.
	   Goenawan, who was accompanied by secretary of Tempo's Alumni
Foundation Putu Setia, the magazine's deputy chief editor Fikri
Jufri and Zulkifli Lubis, said a special team had been established
for handling the logistics of restarting publication.
	   He said a group of friends had stated its willingness to finance
the reestablishment of the magazine, which he pledged would be
different from the host of newsweeklies on the market.
	   ``Why republish the magazine if we do not offer anything new?''
Goenawan said.
	   Fikri said this was an important consideration as several
newsmagazines,taking up Tempo's logo and newswriting style,
appeared shortly after its permit was revoked.
	   He said the new edition of the magazine must woo readers with
fresh draws.
	   Freedom
	   Goenawan, Fikri and Putu agreed in a meeting at the Tempo Cafe
in East Jakarta yesterday that freedom of the media was imperative.
	   ``Whether Tempo will be republished or not is unimportant, the
important thing is that the government must now guarantee freedom
of the press,'' Goenawan said. He urged the government to abolish a
ministerial decree allowing revocation of publication permits.
	   Tempo was closed down in June 1994, together with Editor and
DeTik. Tempo was faulted for its critical report of the
government's purchase of used ships from Germany, while the banning
of the two other publications was attributed to ``administrative
violations''.
	   DeTik was owned by PT Detik Bangun Media Prestasi under the
Yayasan Mulya foundation. In 1996, the now defunct Target tabloid,
with a strikingly similar layout, was published and touted by many
as DeTik's replacement after gaining a new license under a new
company.
	   Eros at the time denied that Target -- with majority shares
owned by Agung Laksono, the director of the private AN-Teve
television station and an executive of the ruling Golkar grouping
-- was a substitute for DeTik. Agung is now state minister of youth
affairs and sports.

	   HUNTER Douglas, a multinational industrial group engaged in the
manufacture of ceilings and claddings, has made Malaysia the hub of
its Asian operations covering 12 countries.
	   It has invested RM65 million in Malaysia to set up three
factories to produce metal ceilings and claddings and to assemble
window furnishing products.
	   Hunter Douglas Manufacturing (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd exports 50 per
cent of its production of metal ceilings and claddings to countries
such as Japan, China, South Korea and India.
	   Its general manager (architectural products division) Azeman
Ghazali said the company's marketing strategy was focused on the
replacement market where metal ceilings could be used to replace
the conventional mineral fibre and gypsum or plaster board which is
currently supplied for most offices.
	   In a statement, Azeman said the local market for metal ceiling
products had been growing at a rate of seven to eight per cent
since the early 1990s.
	   ``We estimate the metal ceiling market to be equivalent to
380,000 square metres this year - about 10 per cent of the total
market for ceilings.''
	   As office buildings move towards higher technology materials to
achieve durability and lesser maintenance, easier integration and

	   LOCAL corporations, which had been complacent in managing their
risks in the past, need to `urgently' enhance their financial risk
management capabilities to protect themselves against volatile
market conditions.
	   Malaysian Monetary Exchange Bhd general manager Mohd Azwar
Mahmud said in times of market turbulence, such as that experienced
by the regional and local market recently, managing risk in passive
and reactive ways could no longer be adequate for them.
	   Mohd Azwar said corporations have to be more proactive and
prudent in managing risk and one of the ways to do it is by using
hedging activities in their operations.
	   ``If they do not hedge, they will be caught by surprise should
there be any sudden moves in the market. Eventually, if the moves
are adverse it will be calculated in their bottom line (earnings).
	   ``This was seen with the results of corporations which suffered
unbelievable magnitude of losses due to the volatility in the
market.''
	   Mohd Azwar said the financial market in this country would
``never ever''
	   be the same again.
	   ``The rules of the game have changed and it is now about
exposure to financial risk by choice and not by chance,'' he told
reporters at the Corporate Treasurers' Colloquium in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   The event was jointly organised by MME and the Malaysian
Association of Corporate Treasurers. Mohd Azwar added that unless
these corporations changed their attitude and adapted to the
changes in the market, it would destroy them.
	   ``Even if the environment is stable and there is no compelling
reason for them to manage their risk, they still need to be more
proactive and prudent,'' he said.
	   He pointed out that the application of derivative instruments in
general requires a comprehensive training programme at all levels
to ensure it is being managed professionally.
	   The professionals must be willing to take more proactive role
towards minimising risk exposures for the corporations, he added.
	   He said MME in its efforts to promote the usage of derivative
products as risk management tools, has been working together with
financial institutions as well as corporations to set up their
derivative desks.
	   ``What we are doing now is getting local corporations to be more
adventurous and aggressive by shifting and expanding their risk
management capabilities,'' Mohd Azwar added.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Moslem leader Amien Rais has spoken out against
allowing sharp political wranglings to drag on and has called on
the nation to take concrete steps to repair its economy, which was
now on the brink of bankruptcy.
	   Amien also appealed for a stop to debates on the legitimacy of
President B.J. Habibie's appointment and for a chance for the new
government to function normally to take steps to restore the
economy. In an address at a gathering yesterday of 10,000 students
from many Indonesian cities held at the Bogor Institute of
Agriculture in Bogor, West Java, Amien reiterated his conviction
that the administration was transitional in nature and that a
general election should be held soon to replace it.
	   Amien's wish for a general election was echoed by Lt. Gen.
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Armed Forces (ABRI) chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs, who said in Purworejo, Central Java, that
the military was of the stance that the sooner the elections could
be held, the better.
	   He was quoted by Antara as saying that the poll, however, should
be prepared well, so it could proceed with as few glitches as
possible.
	   ``ABRI is conducting a study and is of the opinion it would be
better if the poll was held sooner. But it should, really, be well
prepared so no new problems emerge,'' said Susilo after paying his
respects at the grave of Lt. Gen. Sarwo Edhi Wibowo, the late
commander of the Army's special force RPKAD (now Kopassus).
	   Susilo also reminded the public that before the poll could take
place, the existing laws that govern a general election should
first be amended as they recognize only three contestants. They are
Golkar, the United Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic
Party.
	   ``Elections should be held as soon as possible but bear in mind
whether six months would be enough time to change the laws,
especially if there are new parties emerging,'' he said.
	   Amien, who was accompanied to the gathering by economist Faisal
Basri and Minister of Food, Drugs and Agriculture A.M. Saefuddin,
said: ``The administration, even though it is a transitional one,
still needs both domestic and international support in order to be
able to carry out programs to cope with the crisis.''
	   ``It would not be fair to attribute all the economic problems to
the post-Soeharto administration as many of the difficulties are a
legacy of the previous government,'' he said, reported Antara.
	   ``What would be fair, in order to set the economic wheels moving
again in the shortest possible time, is giving an opportunity and
support for economic-restoration programs,'' he said.
	   This stance does not mean the campaign for better order in the
political, legal and constitutional system should stop, he added.
	   ``State policies, including in the economy, are, after all, the
final results of an interaction of various interest groups,
political forces, the business circle as well as the bureaucracy,
which all operate in a certain legal-constitutional order,'' he
said.
	   Forgiveness
	   In another part of his address, Amien called on Indonesians to
``forgive'' former president Soeharto, to give the latter peace of
mind now that he has stepped down. On one condition: Soeharto
should donate to the nation any of his wealth which might have been
amassed illegally.
	   ``Even though there were so many negative sides to his
administration, it's undeniable that he has done the country a
great service during his 32-year rule,'' Amien said in answer to a
student's question.
	   Amien had made the same call earlier this month while asserting
that Soeharto's children, however, did not merit the same
compassion and that they should face punishment should the court
find them guilty of any crimes, including corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   Amien called on the former president to voluntarily donate his
wealth -- and live on 5 percent of the total -- so the country no
longer had to ``beg'' for assistance from donor agencies, such as
the International Monetary Fund. A foreign media once estimated
Soeharto's and his family's fortune worths US$40 billion.
	   ``If he could do that, then Insya Allah (God willing), maybe the
Indonesian people could find it in their hearts to pardon him,''
said Amien, who, on Saturday, called for a ban on the former
president and his family from traveling abroad.
	   Separately, a lesser-known politician, Zakiruddin Djamin of the
National Unity Savior Institute, suggested yesterday that Habibie
should personally approach Soeharto and urge him to donate his
wealth to help the country rebuild its economy.
	   ``Habibie should remind Soeharto of the promise he once made
that he was willing to sacrifice his life, let alone his
belongings, for the nation,'' Djamin said, reported Antara.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Universiti Malaya today refuted claims by
its Academic Staff Association that the university's franchise
programme for the matriculation of science students lacked
transparency and that applicants had not been made aware of the
programme.
	   The university's public relations officer V.T. Ratnam, in
dismissing claims of the programme's haphazard implementation, said
all students had been informed in advance of the private
institutions they would be placed with once all places at the
university were filled.
	   He said this would have been done either by letter, telegram or
telephone prior to registration.
	   Ratnam, however, admitted that there had been a small number of
students who had turned up at the university not knowing where they
would be placed.
	   But this was due to miscommunication, he said.
	   On the association's claim that students placed in private
colleges might have to pay between RM8,000 and RM12,000 annually
compared to the much-lower UM fees of RM3,000 per year, Ratnam said
UM had made arrangements to ensure the fees at the private colleges
would not exceed RM2,500 per semester.
	   He said the colleges had also been instructed not to charge more
than RM500 in registration fees.
	   He also said the association's claim that UM's fees per year
were RM3,000 was incorrect.
	   The actual sum, he said, was RM8,000, after factoring in other
costs such as lecturers' fees and science equipment.
	   On the association's claim that the proper channel was not used
in the selection of private colleges, Ratnam said all colleges
selected under the franchise programme had been scrutinised
thoroughly to ensure their suitability.
	   The colleges had not only been visited but also had all their
facilities (such as science laboratories and accommodation) checked
and certified as up to standard, not just by UM but by the
Education Ministry as well.
	   The selection of private institutions, he added, had been
supervised using the highest standards by a task force.
	   The task force is registered with the Private Education
Department of the Education Ministry.
	   Also involved in the selection process was a UM advisory
committee chaired by vice-chancellor Tan Sri Dr Abdullah Sanusi
Ahmad.
	   UM is one of five universities which have franchise programmes
with private colleges.
	   The other universities are Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti
Malaysia Sabah.
	   The 10 private colleges under UM's franchise scheme are Kolej
Mara, Banting, Kolej Yayasan Pelajaran Mara, Kuantan, Kolej
Matrikulasi Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu, Institut Kemajuan
Ikhtisas Pahang, Kuala Selangor, Institut Goon, Kuala Lumpur,
Institut Maxisegar, Bukit Sentosa, Kolej Uniti, Port Dickson and
Kolej Cempaka, Kuala Lumpur.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP As it grows, World Cup finds new markets, problems AP Sports Writer

RETRANSMITTING to all needing

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The force that rocks the world occurs for one
month every four years _ and it gets bigger and bigger each time
they put up the nets.
	   When the World Cup is held for the 16th time this summer, more
teams will play before more people and generate more money than
ever before. Even grander things are up next _ a cup staged by two
nations and earning billions of dollars in TV and sponsor fees.
	   Its world championship puts soccer on an even higher stage than
normal. By the time the title is decided in the new Stade de France
outside Paris on July 12, a total audience of more than 17 billion
is expected to have watched World Cup matches on TV, more than any
other event by far.
	   But there are fears that what one official calls ``the No. 1
passion event in sports'' may be getting too big and that
fundamental changes are needed to protect its global stature.
	   ``We are running out of countries capable of hosting the cup,
and the more teams you add, the lower the common quality of the
field,'' said Kier Radnadge, editor of World Soccer magazine.
``Probably the highest quality of the tournament was back in
1970.''
	   Seventy years ago, there was no World Cup. The title of soccer's
best went to the winner of the Olympic tournament. But on May 26,
1928, a group of officials led by Jules Rimet of France agreed to
stage a World Cup, and later awarded the first tournament to
Uruguay, the reigning Olympic champ, for 1930.
	   Of the 13 entries in that initial edition, only four came from
outside the Western Hemisphere. A total of 435,000 fans watched the
games, all but a couple played in a single stadium. There was no
TV, of course, and organizers were pleasently surprised that they
could pay all their bills.
	   When defending-champion Brazil and Scotland kick off France '98
the evening of June 10, they will lead a field stretching from
South Africa to South Korea. The 32 teams, double the number of
just 20 years ago, will play in 10 stadiums, total capacity 1.81
million. Television networks around the world paid approximately
dlrs 450 million dollars in rights fees to FIFA, soccer's world
governing body. Organizers are confident of covering their dlrs 270
million budget from private funds.
	   Two things spurred this growth _ TV and the emergence of sports
as perhaps the single largest unifying force of late-20th century
life. Starting with the first satellite transmissions of live
matches in 1970, the World Cup became a truly worldwide event.
	   ``It's always been that soccer was the most popular sport,''
said Jim Trecker, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Soccer
Federation. ``But it was in the 1970s and '80s, through television,
that the World Cup was universally disseminated and allowed all
people to participate.''
	   ``Everything that's happened technically and socially in the
last half-century has suited the game exactly,'' said Radnadge, who
has covered the Cup from his London base since 1966. ``Sport has
become one of the great movements of the 20th century.''
	   That universal audience _ not even moon landings, the Olympics,
or even Princess Diana's funeral come close in sheer numbers _ has
attracted commercial sponsors with wide-open checkbooks to the
World Cup.
	   ``It's just so big that you can't afford not to be involved in
it,'' Radnadge said.
	   So rich is FIFA that every four years it gives each of its 198
national members dlrs 1 million to help develop soccer in their
country.
	   ``To stretch the math a little, that's a 200 million-dollar
giveaway,'' Trecker said. ``That's pretty good.''
	   And that number is set to explode. Next year, a new TV contract
kicks in, worth a total of dlrs 2.5 billion for the World Cups in
2002 and 2006.
	   FIFA will use a good deal of that money to promote grass-roots
soccer programs and boost particiation and fan programs for women's
soccer, a rapidly growing element of the sport.
	   ``In terms of both the potential number of participants and the
potential market, it makes perfect sense,'' Trecker said.
	   But with growth and success have come increased demands and
expectations.
	   Radnadge said the list of countries that can realistically stage
a World Cup now is down to a half dozen _ the United States,
France, Germany, England, Italy and Spain.
	   Trecker said it's time for FIFA to consider spending some of its
money to ease the financial burden of local organziers, especially
with talk about holding the tournament one day in South Africa or
China.
	   ``It think it might be wise to change the equation so those
countries that are economically challenged can still play host,''
he said.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP World Cup mixes lure of the goal with that of cash

RETRANSMITTING to all needing
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   For some soccer players, just reaching the World Cup is prize
enough. For others, it is also the gateway to a lucrative feast.
	   And where money lurks, controversy is bound to be close by.
	   Over the decades, financial bonuses for World Cup performances
have soared to such an extent that many national federations now
prefer to remain tightlipped regarding the matter.
	   Fearing a repeat of disputes with players that bonus
negotiations triggered in previous tournaments, record four-time
champion Brazil, backed by multinational sports product giant Nike,
claims there will be none this time round for the big `R's _
Ronaldo, Romario, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos _ or their teammates.
	   But few believed them, especially after it was added that the
bonuses wouldn't be revealed even if they did exist.
	   Most suspect the South Americans' compensation will tally
closely with that being promised to their Italian counterparts, for
whom a a fourth championship would land a tidy sum of dlrs 278,000,
nearly dlrs 80,000 more than squad members earned for winning the
1982 World Cup.
	   But news reports say the Italian stars, including Roberto Baggio
and Alessandro Del Piero, have been warned they won't get a single
lira unless they reach the semifinals of the 32-team competition.
Once there, however, each player stands to receive dlrs 55,500 each
while even a place in the final would garner them dlrs 195,000.
	   A little less demanding is host France, whose federation has
reportedly set a quarterfinal threshold before unleashing the
centimes. A place in the final eight would merit a dlrs 50,000
reward for each player and that figure will quadruple should they
get to the final.
	   Germany admits it is offering incentives from the start.
Federation spokesman Michael Novak said each player would receive
dlrs 270,000 for winning the title but also will get dlrs 25,000
just for getting beyond the first round.
	   Neighboring Netherlands averted a repeat of the dispute that
marred its run-up to the 1994 Cup by agreeing to a bonus package
``that satisfies both parties,'' according to team captain Frank de
Boer.
	   Reports said the KNVB originally offered a dlrs 70,000 bonus for
winning the Cup _ less than what was agreed to for winning the
European Championship in 1996 _ but eventually agreed to increase
it to dlrs 100,000.
	   Meanwhile, some teams are offering more for getting to the
second round than others can for winning the trophy.
	   Playing in its third World Cup, the United States, reportedly
has pledged a whopping dlrs 250,000 to its players who have been
with the team all the way through qualifying if the side manages to
emerge from the three-game first round, in which it faces Germany,
Yugoslavia and Iran.
	   Some teams at the other end of the scale, however, are still
squabbling over payments from the 1994 Cup.
	   Just last month, FIFA was warning modest Cameroon that unless it
paid former keeper Joseph Antoine Bell dlrs 74,000 owed him since
1994 it could be disqualified from the tournament in France.
	   Bell caused a rumpus in the United States when he led a team
revolt prior to its game against Brazil demanding Cameroon pay
promised bonuses. Cameroon has pledged to resolve the matter.
	   Neighboring Nigeria also found itself embroiled in a row the
same month as players demanded their bonus be increased from dlrs
6,000 to 8,000 per game.
	   Such disputes have led some to argue that team performances are
too dependent on the dollar awards.
	   ``Spain can't be world champions because we don't earn the most
money. Brazilians earn much more,'' said cynical Spanish coach
Javier Clemente.
	   For him, eighth place would suffice for Spain, for which players
would receive dlrs 73,000 each. The team's members have nonetheless
been pledged a total of 280,000 dlrs each if they were to win the
gold statuette.

	   MALAYSIA Airlines has allocated capital investments of RM2.78
billion for the current financial year and subsequent financial
years until 2000 of which the bulk will be for the payment of
aircraft and spare engine.
	   Of the amount, RM1.54 billion would be utilised for aircraft and
spare engine payment and another RM749.1 million would be used for
the second financial year.
	   For the year ending March 31, 1999, the company plans to spend
RM1.8 billion while another RM971.6 million is earmarked for the
year ending March 31, 2000.
	   Executive vice-president of group finance S. Suppiah said the
airline has allocated a total amount of RM130.8 million which would
be spent on projects at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   ``We have also set aside RM360 million for both financial years
for other capital expenditure which include replacement of
equipment with the move to the new airport,'' he said.
	   Suppiah said this at a briefing for analysts, bankers, employees
and the media on Malaysia Airlines' results in Petaling Jaya on
Saturday.
	   The airline has recorded a group pre-tax loss of RM225.36
million for the year ended March 31, 1998, compared to a profit of
RM349.56 million previously.
	   The 164.5 per cent drop was largely due to the weakening ringgit
against the the US dollar with the company suffering a foreign
exchange loss of RM718.4 million.
	   Suppiah said Malaysia Airlines' current assets as at March 31,
1998, stood at RM2.3 billion against RM2.07 billion in the same
period last year.
	   Executive vice-president (airline) Datuk Bashir Ahmad said
Malaysia Airlines has taken steps in anticipation of continued
decline in traffic including the deferment on aircraft deliveries
as well as reduction in flight capacity.
	   Bashir said the airline which had originally expected delivery
of 28 aircraft by 2000, as part of its five-year expansion plan,
has defered the deliveries until 2003.
	   These include the delivery of three B747-400 and four
B777-2001GW which was initially scheduled for between 1999 and
2000.
	   ``We have been quick to inform Boeing on the deferment, so it is
not going to incur much cost,'' added Bashir.
	   He said Malaysia Airlines would not extend the lease on three
B737s and one A330 aircraft while for 1999, there would be no
extension of a A330 leased aircraft.
	   The carrier has also modified aircraft orders from B777-300 to
B777-200, he said adding that there was also an offer for sale of
its existing aircraft.
	   ``We are talking to foreign parties who are interested in buying
or leasing the B777-400. There is a demand now especially for
B777-400 series in Europe and United States,'' Bashir said.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said
the company has taken immediate steps to cut down on operations to
places which were not profitable.
	   ``When the economic downturn happened in the second half of last
year, we quickly made changes in the way we operate the airline. We
have curtailed capacity and made adjustment,'' he added.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP World Cup 2006 a key factor in FIFA presidential vote 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to all needing
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ With eight years and two World Cups still to go,
the host for the 2006 tournament is likely to be decided long
before the decision is announced two years from now.
	   In the fierce competition leading up to the FIFA presidential
elections in Paris on June 8, the 2006 World Cup could figure
prominently in the outcome.
	   Both candidates have expressed support for different venues,
with FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter speaking out for a World
Cup in Africa and the UEFA President Lennart Johansson pushing for
its return to Europe. Votes at the presidential elections could
hinge on the issue.
	   Though the African Football Confederation (CAF) officially
supports Johansson, his backing from those nations appears to be
disintegrating.
	   Johansson's racial comments during a trip to South Africa in
November combined with his support of a European World Cup final in
2006 have endangered key African votes, with several of its 51
nations having hinted they would support Blatter in the secret
ballot among 198 members.
	   Johansson saw his election campaign take another blow when
CONCACAF announced in mid-May its decision to back Blatter.
	   Liberian player George Weah, who plays for Italian club
Internazionale of Milan and a former FIFA Player of the Year, also
has announced he will endorse Blatter and try to convince African
nations to do likewise.
	   South Africa has from the beginning benefitted from the support
of retiring FIFA President Joao Havelange.
	   Havelange, who is stepping down after 24 years as head of FIFA,
created a stir when he virtually promised South Africa the 2006
championship. Blatter has echoed Havelange's sentiments, indicating
he would strongly support an African bid.
	   Blatter said it was not right that he should promise the
competition to Africa including South Africa, Morocco, Nigeria or
Egypt.
	   But he said if they had the necessary infrastructure, they
should have it.
	   ``I cannot promise anything but I said I would work for that,''
he said. ``We must do something for African football.''
	   Johansson even has angered at least one European vote, England,
having openly endorsed Germany. It's a statement Blatter has tried
to use against him.
	   ``How can the Africans vote for someone who has already said he
would give the World Cup to Germany?'' Blatter said.
	   Once considered the front-runners of the chase to host the 2006
World Cup, Germany and England have split the European bid, only
strenghtening the prospect of having it staged in South Africa.
	   Both European countries already have hosted the World Cup,
England in 1966, and Germany in 1974.
	   Not to be overlook in the chase is Brazil, the four-time
champion, which can also expect to receive strong support. Other
competition may come from Australia which also has expressed
interest in hosting the event.
	   But clearly, staging one of the world's largest events in South
Africa, backed by President Nelson Mandela, is an enticing prospect
_ not only for FIFA but for the International Olympic Committee,
which also loudly has applauded the nation's bid to host the 2008
Olympic Games.
	   Since the first World Cup in 1930, the finals have been staged
in Europe nine times, in South America four times, North America
three times and Asia (Japan-South Korea) will be organizing it for
the first time in 2002. Africa and Oceania are the only regions to
have never hosted the tournament.
	   The decision on the host country for the 2006 World Cup will be
made by the 24 members of FIFA's Executive Committee in June of
2000.

Rwanda says stability in danger unless it gets debt relief 
</HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Without international support, the Rwandan
government will not be able to service a dlrs 1 billion debt and
maintain economic and political stability, the finance minister
said.
	   In a speech prepared for an international meeting of donors in
Stockholm, Sweden, on Tuesday and Wednesday, Finance Minister
Donald Kaberuka appealed for dlrs 767 million in the next three
years to sustain the cost of reforms.
	   The World Bank has warned the national reconciliation and
prevention of renewed ethnic violence will depend on success of the
reforms.
	   ``Crucially, the debt relief is itself ... restricting the
ability of the government to undertake the critical social
interventions required to bring about social reconciliation,
reintegration and the necessary sustainable human development,''
Kaberuka said, according to a copy of his speech made available to
The Associated Press on Monday.
	   So far, donors have been satisfied with the government's record
in restoring peace after a 1994 genocide, resettling more than 1
million refugees and stabilizing the economy.
	   But economists say one of the key constrains lies in Rwanda's
inability to service dlrs 1.2 billion in external debt and a high
level of military spending at a time when the Tutsi-led army is
fighting Hutu rebels.
	   Rwanda has been paying dlrs 17 million each year to service the
debt, most of it to multilateral creditors such as the
International Development Association, the African Development Bank
and the World Bank.
	   The money was acquired by the former Hutu-led government
responsible for the 1994 slaughter of 500,000 minority Tutsis. In
July 1994, Tutsi rebels won power and started on an ambitious
recovery plan to sell state-owned property, restructure civil
service and reintegrate thousands of former Hutu soldiers and civil
servants to win their confidence.
	   But Kaberuka said the debt burden was too heavy too sustain and
insufficient to clear Rwanda from its debt in a foreseeable future.
	   In his speech, he appealed for a special case for Rwanda, under
which the international donor community should write off dlrs 97.5
million in debt arrears and establish a Multilateral Debt Trust
Fund to help finance the multilateral debt service until 2001.
	   Under the proposal, the trust fund would be administered by the
World Bank to ensure accountability and render reports to donors.
	   If successful, the measures would help Rwanda qualify in three
years for a debt relief.
	   Such debt relief, under a World Bank-IMF program known as Highly
Indebted Poor Countries' Initiative, has already been granted to
Uganda and Mozambique, both credited with economic reforms.
	   The amount of money used for servicing the debt would enable
Rwanda to meet urgent social needs; support the victims of genocide
and the cost of demobilization; and to finance the transition from
crisis to sustainable economic growth, the World Bank said.

	   THE Securities Commission has extended by a month to July 1 the
deadline for the disclosure of substantial shareholdings ``due to
overwhelming requests from parties concerned'', it said in a
statement yesterday.
	   According to the Securities Industry (Reporting of Substantial
Shareholding) Regulations 1998, a person who is a substantial
shareholder in a listed or non-listed public company shall give
notice to the SC on the particulars of the interest.
	   Also, the new section 99B of the Securities Industry Act imposes
a duty on chief executives and directors of listed firms to
disclose their interests in securities of the listed corporation or
any associated entity.
	   The securities watchdog said submissions have been slow in
coming and reminded parties involved that the penalty for
non-compliance with the regulations was a fine not exceeding
RM500,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both.
	   Any queries on the disclosure requirements should be directed to
the Corporate Affairs Department of the SC at 03-2539988.

	   MALAYSIAN Resources Corporation Bhd expects its debt ratio to
decline to 0.4 from the current 0.6 against its shareholders fund
of RM2.86 billion following a US$100 million (RM380 million) loan
repayment in September.
	   This will be the initial payment for a US$250 million bridging
facility.
	   Chief operating officer Izzaddin Idris said at present MRCB's
total debt stood at RM1.6 billion.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference after MRCB's annual
general meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
	   He added that the proceeds from the sale of MRCB's 15 per stake
in Malakoff Bhd would be used to partly repay the US$100 million
debt.
	   MRCB, which at present has a 36.57 per cent stake in Malakofk,
has proposed to dispose a 15 per cent stake to UK-based National
Power Plc.
	   ``We expect the deal between Malakoff and National Power to be
finalised by this August,'' he said.
	   On reasons behind MRCB offering the stake to a foreign company
and not local independent power producers, Izzaddin said National
Power would be Malakoff's exclusive foreign business and investment
partner in Malaysia, with respect to potential power generation or
other electricity-related projects that require foreign investment.
	   National Power, one of the world's largest independent power
companies listed on both the London and New York stock exchanges,
generates 20 per cent of UK's electricity while its combined UK and
overseas generation portfolio stands at 32,400 megawatts.
	   On MRCB's strategy to survive in this trying times, Izzaddin
said the group would focus on tapping its internal resources and
set up strategic alliances which would create a win-win situation
for companies within the group.
	   Meanwhile, executive chairman Datuk Khalid Ahmad said MRCB would
not rule out the possibility of establishing joint ventures with
foreign companies if good investment opportunities arise.
	   MRCB's group pre-tax profit declined 65 per cent to RM51.94
million for the half year ended Feb 28, 1998, from RM147.93 million
in the previous corresponding period.
	   Group turnover declined by 36 per cent to RM310.06 million from
RM481.56 million last year.
	   It attributed the lower turnover to the completion of
construction works in its power-related joint venture projects -
one of its core businesses.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP Rimet's tournament returns, bringing back fading glory AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to all needing
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The 1998 World Cup brings France a last flourish of
badly needed glory in the fading millennium, and the French are
sparing no effort to wrap the games in grandeur.
	   ``The World Cup must stamp our history,'' President Jacques
Chirac said in January, inaugurating the new Stade de France near
Paris with all the pomp of a Sun King opening Versailles Palace.
	   For months now, officials have been spouting superlatives.
	   This time, 32 teams compete instead of the 24 that have taken
the field since 1982. With rebroadcasts, 37 billion people will
watch at least some play, twice the audience of the Olympics Games.
	   Over 33 days, 64 matches are scheduled in 10 stadiums from the
soccer-mad little mining town of Lens in the north to the ancient
Mediterranean port of Marseilles.
	   A half billion dollars went into the Stade de France, an
80,000-seat concrete flying saucer hovering near Paris, where play
will begin and end with elaborate fanfare.
	   Another billion was raised from commercial sponsors, tickets and
public funds for the French Organizing Committee (CFO) and
facilities. Technicians laid 2.5 million kilometers (1.5 million
miles) of fiber optic cable.
	   But for most Frenchmen, the best part of the 16th World Cup is
that it is theirs, a planetary platform to wave the blue, white and
red Tricolor and a chance to throw the biggest dinner party ever.
	   French football fans are praying for an unlikely victory for
more than the usual reasons.
	   A French journalist thought up the idea of a world federation in
1904. Two Frenchmen were behind the first Cup, in Uruguay in 1930,
and a French striker scored the first goal.
	   Michel Platini's goal in 1986 helped beat Brazil to put Les
Bleus into the semifinals. But the French have never reached the
final. A last game between, say, France and Brazil, would make
their millennium.
	   Even many who are fleeing for the duration are happy about the
venue. As France melts into a European Union and Americanisms
muscle into the culture, Paris will be the capital of the world.
	   From the opening extravaganza to the final frenzy, the
tournament promises to be distinctly French.
	   Among the official suppliers is Yves Saint Laurent. There is an
appointed purveyor of dairy products.
	   ``We did have one problem at the stadium inauguration,'' allowed
Pierre Parisot, director of the Stade de France. ``The hot dogs
were terrible. Cold, all wrong.''
	   But, he added, spectators seemed pleased with the four posh
Parisian caterers who served 11,000 meals. And patrons praised the
wine cellar of the panoramic gourmet restaurant, run by Lenotre.
	   Along the Champs Elysees, Frenchmen jostle with tourists to buy
pins, T-shirts and blue-white-red soccer balls from an official
World Cup stuff shop.
	   Upon reflection, officials withdrew the official World Cup
knife.
	   Just about every item is emblazoned with the ubiquitous mascot:
Footix, a cocky-looking little blue and red rooster with a goofy
grin.
	   Huge streetcorner posters push the slogan, ``It's not every day
that we welcome the whole world.'' On one, a come-hither beauty in
a slinky white sheath holds a tray at a lustrous Paris bistro.
	   Perhaps to add an extra French touch, truck drivers and
transport unions have threatened to strike during the tournament,
choking off access to the stadiums.
	   One popular booklet advises visitors how not to get cheated by
merchants, hotelkeepers and taxi drivers. Another instructs locals
to say ``moutchas gracias'' and its equivalent in a score of
tongues.
	   On television, talking heads give soccer new social and
political dimensions.
	   Sociologist Christian Bromberger told a colloquium he saw a
``footballization of society.'' He said, ``It is a profound game, a
condensed source of all emotions: joy, anguish, revolt,
injustice.''
	   Many fear it is also a source of violence, and police have made
complex plans to contain hooligans or rowdy fans who do not make it
into stadiums.
	   For a while, tourism officials urged Britons to come without
tickets and watch matches on outdoor screens. Someone thought about
that again and changed the message: Stay home.
	   Tickets are already a sore point.
	   After the European Union and other countries roasted France for
keeping the lion's share of the tickets for Frenchmen, organizers
scraped up 110,000 tickets for foreigners to order by phone.
	   The April day they went on sale, however, 20 million calls
swamped the 90 operators, and it took two weeks before the tickets
could be sold to the lucky few who managed to get through.
	   In London, the Daily Mirror reported that an elderly Englishman
destroyed finger ligaments by repeated dialling.
	   Of 2.5 million tickets, two-thirds were allotted to Frenchmen,
and another 12 percent to the organizing committee and commercial
affiliates. Tour operators got another 8 percent.
	   Tickets to early matches went on sale in France in 1996, and
were sold out a year ago. In December, a lottery among Frenchmen
determined who could buy tickets for the nine deciding matches.
	   For instance, real estate executive Pierre Macchi and a friend
each applied for four tickets to the finals. Both wound up with two
seats. ``You can imagine,'' he said, ``we were ecstatic.''
	   He paid dlrs 600 per ticket and could have sold the two extras
for three times that. Instead, he gave them to an equally ecstatic
friend for merely twice the face value, which reduced his cost to
zero.
	   Tickets or not, fans are swarming to France which, with annual
arrivals of 67 million, is already the world's most visited
country. By May, 360,000 hotel rooms were booked, mostly in Paris.
	   The show starts June 9 with a Festival of Football, a citywide
splash of color and sound climaxing at the Place de la Concorde, a
sweep of dramatic stone and space at the heart of Paris.
	   Details are guarded with the zeal of a state secret. Four
parades will start at classic monuments, with music and costumes of
dozens of cultures blending with a French accent.
	   In the nation of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, the
festival's theme is Excitement, Universality, and Sharing.
	   There are some rubs.
	   None of the 12 official sponsors, and only four of the eight
suppliers, are French. The games' official restaurant is McDonalds.
	   Soccer-hating Frenchmen have formed a tongue-in-cheek
association called, ``The Cup Is Full,'' to plan alternative
activities in June and July. If popular, the group represents a
clear minority.
	   Starting June 10, first-round matches will be played in nine
provincial cities chosen for their football traditions, their ample
stadiums, and their accessibility.
	   Each has tried to outdo the other to remain in visitors'
memories.
	   The largest stadium outside Paris is the wide open 60,000-seat

just outside of Lille at the top of France.
	   The 47,000-seat stadium can hold 1 1-2 times the city's
population. And early in May, when Lens won the French league
title, most townsfolk were there at 3 a.m. when the team returned
home.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP Two-time World Cup runner-up aims again for top spot 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to all needing
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Another major soccer tournament.
Another talent-packed Dutch soccer side. Another near miss?
	   From trusty Ajax goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar to star strikers
Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert, the Netherlands _ World Cup
runnerup in 1974 and 1978 _ has the quality to take the title.
	   The question _ as always _ is whether they also have the
temperament to play as a team rather than 11 talented individuals.
	   Ajax Amsterdam's Danish coach, Morten Olsen, recently said that
the Dutch do not have the character to take soccer's most
prestigious title.
	   That was evident at the last major soccer tournament, Euro 96,
when players in the fancied Dutch squad reportedly split along
black-white lines and midfielder Edgar Davids was sent home for
publicly criticizing coach Guus Hiddink.
	   This time around, Hiddink is attempting to shield his 22-man
squad from the pressures of the tournament, while giving them a
chance to let off steam during the long campaign.
	   Hiddink has commandeered a hotel in the mountains above Monte
Carlo as the Dutch base this summer. ``Players will have privacy,
but will also be able to get out and meet people. We want to avoid
them getting bored,'' he said.
	   After nearly two years on the international sidelines as
punishment for the Euro 96 bust up, Davids' form has been so good
with Italian giant Juventus that he now is a near certainty to
play.
	   Davids is likely to share the midfield with old Ajax teammates
Clarence Seedorf, now with Real Madrid, and Ronald de Boer. The
hard-working Juventus star is seen as an ideal defensive foil for
De Boer and Seedorf, who both tend to push forward looking to
create or score goals.
	   In Ajax's Van der Sar, the Dutch have one of the world's most
reliable goalkeepers. The bean-pole Amsterdammer has conceded just
20 goals in 33 league matches this season.
	   The Dutch also boast the world's most expensive defender, Jaap
Stam, the PSV Eindhoven center back who will play for Manchester
United next season.
	   Off the field, Hiddink has assembled an impressive bench of
assistant coaches with a wealth of major tournament experience.
	   Ex-internationals Johan Neeskens, Ronald Koeman and Frank
Rijkaard are key members of the Dutch party. Rijkaard's appointment
was seen as an effort to boost the morale of young players like
Seedorf, Kluivert and Davids who share Rijkaard's Surinamese roots.
In his last year with Ajax, Rijkaard acted as a seasoned mentor for
the young guns.
	   His calm head and experience could be crucial for the Dutch who
always carry a huge weight of expectation from their fanatical
orange-clad fans.
	   Not only do the supporters expect their team to win, they expect
them to win in style, playing the kind of attacking ``total
football'' that took the Dutch to two World Cup finals in the
1970s.

	   THE Shah Alam Municipal Council wants to consider all
implications before accepting the Selangor Government's offer to
take over the management and maintenance of the Shah Alam
International Aquatic Centre.
	   Council president Mohamad Adzib Mohd Isa said the council had to
study, among other things, maintenance, potential profits, fees to
be charged and whether or not the centre's maintenance be
privatised.
	   His response followed councillor Mohd Zin Mohamad's query on
when the council would take over the centre and open it to the
public.
	   The centre, built by Worldwide PKNS, is owned by the State's
Sports Council.
	   It was first used during the Sukma Games.
	   ``The council has to study the matter thoroughly before
accepting the offer. The centre will still be opened to the public
even if the council declines the offer,'' he added.

	   THE Shah Alam Municipal Council has no authority to stop
residents from overcrowding houses and causing poor ventilation.
	   Council president Mohamad Adzib Mohd Isa said the council could
only advise residents but not take legal action against them.
	   He was replying councillor Mohd Zain Mohamad's question on five
cases of tuberculosis in the municipality last month.
	   The meeting was informed that investigations had revealed that
poor ventilation and overcrowding in houses were factors
contributing to the occurrence of the air-borne disease. The
victims were aged between 24 and 62.
	   The houses had a certificate of fitness issued by the council.
	   Mohd Zain questioned the council's building and planning
department for approving CF for the houses.
	   Mohamad Adzib said the question of adequate ventilation was
considered when approving the CF.
	   ``But sometimes, in a small house, the occupants tend to make
use of store rooms and utility rooms for living purposes, when
these rooms are not meant for such use,'' he said.

	   HIS name has been stepped on, dragged through the mud, and
smeared in just about every way - mostly by children.
	   But he is not some unfortunate victim of malicious mouthing - he
is in fact, Thomas J. Bata, whose name adorns every school-going
child's shoes.
	   At 83, Bata, who opened the newest retail outlet at KLCC in
Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, is a sprightly, browned version of Santa
Claus, snowy hair and all. Conspicuously absent are the elves,
dancing at his fingertips.
	   ``Yes, I wore Bata shoes as a child,'' he says, answering a
million-dollar question.
	   And now?
	   ``Now I mostly wear Bata shoes. But I also wear other shoes
because that is the only way to make a comparison,'' he says
triumphantly, neatly sidestepping what could have been an awkward
question.
	   ``And,'' he says warming up, ``sometimes I wear a different shoe
on each foot!''
	   Bata was born into a shoe-making family. Twelve generations ago,
an ancestral member of the Bata clan decided that farm prices were
too low, and that shoes were a better business.
	   In 1894, Thomas' father, Tomas, converted that hand-operated
business to a machine-manufactured one, and the Bata shoe empire
was born.
	   ``See, I have even developed a shoemaker's thumb,'' he says,
waving a thumb that curves sharply backwards, usually acquired by
cobblers who cut leather by hand.
	   Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, just before the First World War,
Bata's childhood was filled with sporting activities like horseback
riding, skiing in the winter and swimming in the summer.
	   His early schooling took place in England and Switzerland, and
his degrees (including a Doctor of Sciences) were obtained in
Czechoslovakia.
	   At the age of 24, he emigrated to Canada, where he has lived for
the past 59 years.
	   His English, though flawless, is still heavily-inflected with an
Eastern European accent.
	   And he is still as active as ever.
	   Hours after stepping off a plane from Oslo, Norway, he entered
the interview room, leaning heavily on a cane. One could have been
forgiven for assuming that this was a sign of age. But no, the cane
was because he ``skied stupidly'' and is at the tail-end of
recovery from a broken leg.
	   As the only child, was the pressure on him to take over the
business?
	   ``I never really wanted to get out of it,'' he says, again
circumventing the real question.
	   But would his father have been disappointed if he hadn't shown
any interest?
	   ``Perhaps. But if I had wanted to become a doctor, for example,
I don't think he would have stopped me. And if I had become a good
doctor, he would even have been pleased.''
	   However, there seems to have been no danger of a lack of
interest.
	   At age 16, the younger Bata got directly involved when, on his
own drawing-board, he tried to improve the models the company was
then producing.
	   He remained as involved in designing until the age of 60, which
means that those still in school in 1975 may have worn shoes
created by the man himself.
	   Bata shoes first made their appearance in Malaya in 1930, when a
retail outlet was opened in Capitol Street, Singapore. Through many
periods of corporate restructuring and growth, Bata Malaysia, which
manufactures and retails, was established.
	   To date, school shoes remain the best-selling item.
	   Due to its ubiquitous quality here, and its seeming absence in
some Western countries, many have mistaken Bata for a local brand.
	   But although Bata may not retail under its own name in these
places, the company supplies some models to other retailers, such
as Marks and Spencers.
	   In fact, in Indonesia, Thailand and Chile, Bata also makes shoes
for Adidas, Nike and New Balance.
	   However, there is no likelihood that the Bata brand-name will be
phased out. Transcending the boundaries of icon, it has become an
institution. My wordprocessing programme which underlines Prada
with a disapproving red line, has no such trouble with Bata.
	   In the words of Thomas J. Bata: ``We do not aspire to be in a
super luxury class. Our ambition is to serve a wider range of the
population with first-class, progressive products at a reasonable
price.''
	   Bata Bites: Bata Shoe Organisation Ltd is named after its
Czechoslovakian founder Tomas Bata.
	   The company's headquarters are in Toronto, Canada.
	   The first Bata outlet in Malaysia was opened in Jalan Pudu,
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Bata has two factories in Malaysia, one in Klang, the other in
Seremban.
	   In 1997, Bata Malaysia exported 2.5 million pairs of shoes to
Europe and North America. Italy alone bought nearly 500,000 pairs.
	   In the same year, 11.5 million pairs, largely school shoes, were
sold in Malaysia.
	   Twenty-five per cent of total annual sales come from Asia.
	   There are 250 Bata stores in the country.
	   Besides Selangor and the Federal Territory, which have 60
stores, the state with the largest number of stores is Johor, with
30.
	   Sabah has the least number of outlets, at 13.
	   The latest Bata outlet which is 2,700 square metres big, opened
at KLCC in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
	   This year, Bata Malaysia will open more big outlets in: Miri,
Kuantan, Johor Baru, Ipoh, Malacca, Kuala Terengganu, Kota Kinabalu
and Penang.
	   Bata Malaysia also runs Athlete's World, which carries a variety
of athletic products.

	   THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council will improve drainage in
flood-prone areas.
	   Its president Mohamad Nor Bador said the council could not carry
out too many projects at the same time and needed the co-operation
of residents in keeping drains clean.
	   ``Residents should not only depend on the council to clean up
drains.
	   They should hold gotong-royong sessions to clean up their
areas,'' he added.
	   He said clogged drains could be due to complacence on behalf of
council workers who knew that Alam Flora Sdn Bhd would be taking
over drain cleaning services from July 1.
	   ``We realise the problem and the council will try its best to
accommodate the needs of the people,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, councillor Raja Ropiah Raja Abdullah said the council
should look into the widening and cleaning of clogged drains as
preparation for the impending weather conditions, which are
expected to bring heavy rainfall to the region.
	   She said the council had to act fast as it should not be blamed
later for poor planning.
	   ``This is important as we do not want people to blame the
council later for not preparing for the floods,'' she said.

Israel decides against selling off most of El Al 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday decided to retain ownership of
51 percent of the national air carrier El Al, despite
recommendations the unprofitable company be sold off.
	   A statement from the ministerial committee overseeing Israel's
privatization plans quoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as
saying the decision ``will protect our national interests.''
	   Israel radio said national security and emergency situations
were key factors in the decision to retain a majority share of the
airline.
	   The decision ensures that El Al flights will continue to be
grounded during the Jewish Sabbath _ from Friday sundown to
Saturday sundown. The Sabbath groundings have been cited as a
factor in the company's losses.
	   A government panel had recommended that the airline be sold off
by this year. El Al lost dlrs 83 million in 1996 and dlrs 35
million last year.
	   No date has been set for selling off 49 percent of the company.

	   THE Rotaract Club of Petaling Jaya, in line with its Community
Service Programme, organised a three-day weekend excursion to
A'Famosa Resort in Malacca, recently for a group of young cancer
patients.
	   More than 20 young patients from the Oncology Units of
Universiti Hospital and the Paediatrics Institute of Kuala Lumpur
Hospital were transported to the A'Farmosa Resort at Alor Gajah,
Malacca, recently.
	   Themed the ``Golden Child Project'', the event was officially
launched by Petaling Jaya Rotary Club president Rosman Din the same
day, after the arrival of the little ones at the resort.
	   Project co-ordinator Rotarian Fabian Pereira said the excursion
was a rare opportunity for the special children to have a
pleasureable outing not normally available to them, besides
providing an opportunity for members of the Rotary International
and the medical fraternity to mingle with the children.
	   ``The children were treated to three days of fun at the resort,
which included magic shows, performances by a clown, telematches
and flag-making competitions.
	   ``The children also surprised everyone by presenting songs,
pantun and sketches. Even their parents performed and took part in
the games, to the amusement of the children,'' Pereira said.
	   Rotarians agreed that the happiness expressed by the children
will long be remembered.

	   R. GUNA could go on and on about Remington Steel - not the TV
sleuth, but his favourite typewriter.
	   His Remington is about 45 years old, of semi-standard issue,
weighs slightly over three kilogrammes and is silent.
	   Guna also has a Remington Rand, a portable, in his shop. Both
Remingtons can fetch up to RM1,000 each.
	   Guna loves old typewriters which others would dismiss as junk.
	   The Remington and Royal typewriters were both popular in the
1950s, he says. The American-made Royal is distinguished by its
letters on cardboard, placed on the transparent keytops. It is neat
and smaller in size, and was popular in the past with planters who
bought them for their wives to type those lengthy letters home.
	   Look around the shop and one can find names like Imperial
(British-made), Roneo (UK), Hermes (Swiss) and Olivetti (Italy).
	   The shop is a mass of old keyboards, spare parts and gadgets
haphazardly heaped along dusty shelves.
	   Guna inherited the business in 1977 after the death of his
father. As he was the only one interested in carrying on the
business, he quit his job as a costing and store clerk at
McAlister's in Jalan Kidd and, with the help of his father's friend
Khoo Swee Yong, started repairing and reconditioning typewriters.
	   His father had started the shop in 1951, servicing typewriters
for plantations, banks, Government departments and hospitals.
	   For instance, said Guna, ``we have been making office calls at
United Plantations since 1957. It was then known as Bernam Oil
Plantations.''
	   From servicing of typewriters, customers later asked him to
repair those which had broken down. A repair job could take two
months and cost from RM300 to RM600 inclusive of spare parts, he
said.
	   ``Many people opt to repair these `antiques' because they trust
these machines more than modern ones,'' he said.
	   Guna has lovingly restored, polished and fine-tuned machines
left by customers who never returned for them. Restoration work is
time-consuming and has to be done on a trial-and-error basis.
	   He said a typewriter between 30 and 40 years old can be sold for
between RM800 and RM1,000 to collectors and writers. Some banks,
for instance, still keep their old typewriters for sentimental
reasons.
	   Added Guna: ``One can ascertain a typewriter's quality by the
impression of the typewritten characters.
	   ``The old ones also tend to be rust-free since they are made of
steel.
	   The type of ribbons used also differs,'' he said.

	   AFTER operating for 90 years, the Escoy Smelting Sdn Bhd tin ore
smelting factory in Penang closed down at the end of March.
	   The 7.7ha plant in Jalan Datuk Keramat shut down its furnaces
and will spend the next two months clearing up. It will open a
plant in Phuket, South Thailand, to take advantage of the cheaper
labour there.
	   Escoy managing director Datuk Nazir Ariff said the decision to
move to Phuket was made a few years ago.
	   Among the reasons were that the Penang plant was located right
in the city centre, and also the fact that there was a shortage of
tin ore resulting in very little smelting being carried out.
	   Nazir said the services of the 500 workers had been terminated.
The company, he said, has yet to decide on development plans for
the former smelting site.
	   Escoy, whose parent company is Amalgamated Metal Corporation
Private Ltd, London, was formerly known as Datuk Keramat Smelting
and prior to that as Eastern Smelting when it was established in
1908.
	   This international tin smelting concern began as Seng Kee Tin
Smelting Works in 1897, and its founder was Lee Chin Ho, the first
Chinese smelter to adopt the use of European reveberatory furnaces.
	   Tin was transferred from the company's mines at Gopeng, Perak,
and also from the mines of South Thailand and smelted into ingots
for re-export.
	   In 1907, the company was floated as Eastern Smelting, a limited
liability company with a capital of $500,000, attracting North
Malaya's largest tin magnates to its board, including the renowned
Khaw family.
	   Chin Ho lived in a building built in 1908 which later came to be
known as Birch House, while his relatives and workers lived in the
surrounding row of houses in Chin Ho Square. It is believed that
the house was named after Sir Ernest Woodford Birch who was the
British Resident of Perak from 1904 until he retired in 1911.
	   Birch was the eldest son of J.W.W. Birch, the Straits Settlement
colonial secretary and British Resident of Perak who was
assassinated in Pasir Salak in November 1875.
	   Chin Ho gave up his stake in the firm in 1910 but continued to
live at Birch House until it was taken over as the company offices
in the 1930s.
	   It was given a modern facade after the war. The back door
conveniently leads to the smelting-works proper.
	   Birch House was renovated in 1963 with the front porch
demolished and a new roof laid on. The Chinese architecture of the
house was also preserved.
	   In 1983, the company spent RM30,000 to repair a gold leaf inlaid
arch in the hallway. Chin Ho had imported the arch from China and
it was made without the use of screws or nails, and just fits
together.
	   The tin works, located in the vicinity of the old Kampung Jawa
village, conveniently employed Javanese labour.
	   When the factory expanded, more workers were brought in from
Java, and these later arrivals extended the neighbourhood,
establishing Kampung Jawa Baru next to Kampung Jawa Lama.
	   The company was renamed Datuk Keramat Smelting Sdn Bhd in 1974.

Stop collusion in awarding projects, councilors say, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): Councilors and a contractor urged the city
administration Saturday to stop the rampant collusion, corruption,
cronyism and nepotism in the awarding of its development projects.
	   They argued that the time had come for the administration to
promote clean governance in line with the growing spirit of
political and economic reforms.
	   Amarullah Asbah, head of the City Council's Commission C for
financial affairs, said the administration had for years been
notorious for red-tape that spurred a high-cost economy.
	   ``It's public knowledge that many projects are awarded without
fair bidding,'' he said. ``People wanting to participate in a bid
have to deal with countless (people at) desks to succeed.''
	   The administration should move fast to end the corrupt practices
to improve its image, said Amarullah from the Golkar faction.
	   Lukman F. Mokoginta, head of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) faction, said many projects were awarded to certain companies
by way of engineered bidding.
	   ``Projects are awarded through collusion, cronyism and nepotism
involving officials,'' he said.
	   Such practices are rampant not only in the city administration,
but also at other government institutions, said the member of
Commission D for development affairs.
	   Lukman said the engineering of bids involved officials from the
highest to lowest levels.
	   ``The project manager, head and members of the bidding
committee, head of the office or even the typist could be involved
in collusion,'' he said.
	   He said contractors could obtain information about proposed
projects long before they were tendered.
	   ``A project plan should be kept confidential until it is offered
for bid. But some contractors get drafts from corrupt officials
even before the administration reveals its yearly budget in
April,'' he said.
	   A contractor who spoke on condition of anonymity told The
Jakarta Post that it was easy for someone to get a project at the
administration if they had a friend or relative within the
bureaucracy.
	   ``It is common for officials, like the project manager or head
of a department, to disclose a project planned for the next fiscal
year to contractors they know well.
	   ``It is common for contractors who have become part of the inner
circle to be awarded a project well before it is made public. In
this case bidding is a mere formality,'' said the source, who
admitted that he had been granted several projects through such a
process.
	   The formal bidding is attended by 11 bidders who already know
who will be awarded the project. The one who is awarded the
contract then cooperates with the 10 who lost out.
	   ``We call them bidding associates. They'll lend you their
documents to be used in the contrived bid. It is customary to pay
dues of between 2 percent and 5 percent of the project value to be
shared by the 10 companies.
	   ``Remember that as a picked contractor, you have to pay 'thank
you' fees to the officials. Usually we allocate 20 percent of the
project value for them,'' he said.
	   He said bidding associates, who usually gather in a particular
corner in the administration complex every day, were long-time
partners of city bureaucrats.
	   ``They (bidding associates) know full-well that they will always
get lots of money as long as there are corrupt officials.''
	   Amarullah said the corrupt practices had badly tarnished the
city administration's image.
	   ``The administration must get rid of these bidding associates,''
he noted.
	   According to Lukman, the council has tried to put a stop the
collusion and corruption for years but the call has fallen on deaf
bureaucrats' ears.

	   NOTHING is more invigorating than being greeted by colourful
annuals and other garden shrubs and creepers when you step out
first thing in the morning. We complain about the warmth and
dryness outside, but this time of year - hot, dry periods - brings
out the best in summer flowering plants. Plan your planting; select
species to suit your needs. As I often say, planting garden annuals
and herbaceous perennials is not particularly difficult and
involves only digging the soil to a reasonable depth, bringing in
organic material to upgrade its organic status and moisture
retention, as well as coarse sand for all-important soil aeration
and drainage, to ensure healthy plant growth.
	   Here are some of the colourful annuals you can try your hand at.
They are not difficult to raise from packet seeds; an average of 20
or 30 seedlings are easily obtainable from one small packet of
seeds costing about RM2.50. Annual seedlings planted in a small
polybag will cost between RM1 and RM2 each, depending on variety
and species.
	   Balsams
	   This colourful annual flower is easy to grow and will reward you
with lovely blooms in about eight weeks. The plant flowers right up
to two or three weeks before it dies. Balsams love the sun and are
not choosy about soil type, provided there is good drainage,
organic matter and moisture.
	   It can tolerate a certain amount of shade.
	   Yates' Superb Double Mixture seeds, readily available in the
country, have all the finest colours and lovely blooms; an example
is the camellia.
	   The plant will grow up to 45cm high. It will do best in raised
beds prepared beforehand with a liberal dressing of well-rotted
organic manure or compost; this will provide moisture retention and
fertility. Balsams are very vigorous growers and respond well if
soil is well-prepared and mulched.
	   The mulch can be, simply, dried grass clippings. Lawn clippings
should not be discarded, as they can be useful mulching or compost
material that will eventually be returned to the soil.
	   Balsam seeds are fairly large (half the size of the green pea)
and can be sown directly into the soil (or polybag or pots - one
seed will be enough); sow seeds 3-4mm deep.
	   Seedlings should be spaced 30cm between rows and 25cm between
plants.
	   This should give the actively-growing seedlings lots of room to
develop into healthy plants, with maximum flowering capacity.
	   The plants should be well-watered twice a day; A layer of
organic mulch will help keep surface roots cool and moist.
Flowering should begin six or seven weeks from sowing. In Malaysia,
balsam has always been a popular flower, especially in school
gardens, because it is so easy to grow and has bright colours,
ranging from white to pink to wine.
	   Portulaca
	   Portulaca is another dazzling, colourful annual. Once it
matures, it will flower continuously; flowering is rather
short-lived, but there is prolific bud formation. This helps keep
up flower production, especially during the four or five hours of
the morning before the sun becomes too hot. Flowering portulaca
looks like a carpet of colours - white, pink, red, orange, lilac
and other intermediates.
	   Portulaca is a low-growing succulent annual (or perennial),
boasting lovely rose-like blooms. It is known in Malaysia as the
Japanese Rose. How this name came about is a mystery, because it is
neither Japanese nor a rose! Portulaca was originally found in
Brazil, but it soon spread to all warm parts of the world. It is an
extremely hardy plant. It is herbaceous, and is ideal for rock
gardens and low borders. Leaves are greatly modified into rod-like
structures.
	   The original portulaca is very common in rural areas, where it
is found growing in sandy soil, particularly along the coast. This
species is more of a perennial than an annual. It bears light
purple flowers and blooms during the first half of the day, after
which all its flowers fade; by morning of the next day, though,
flowers burst forth again.
	   New portulaca varieties have now appeared. These are more
colourful than the original purple. In all types, flowering is more
profuse in the late mornings, before it gets too hot.
	   Because the plants have endless flowering stems (the plant grows
in rosette form) and have flowering buds in abundance, flowering
seems to be continuous. As the short-lived flowers fade, new ones
open to take their place.
	   Portulaca is extremely hardy, even in very harsh conditions. It
is common knowledge that to encourage it to flower well, do not
pamper the plant and do not overwater. Over-watering or pampering
with nutrients will lead to a lush growth of foliage at the expense
of flowering.
	   Portulaca thrives in sandy soils and enjoys the sun - the hotter
the better.
	   The plant is propagated by stem cuttings, as well as by seeds.
	   Seeds are very fine and contained in cup-shaped structures.
	   Plants creep along the ground, protecting their roots; they are
excellent in smothering weeds. Plants should be watered in dry
weather, but do not overwater - they prefer rather dry conditions.
	   The plant has single- and double-flowered varieties.
	   Sunnybank double mixed is the most widely-planted, and boasts a
range of bright colours.
	   New varieties you can grow are the Yates' Sunnybank mixed; this
contains both doubles and singles in a wide range of brilliant
colour.
	   Yates'
	   Dazzle Doubles is a fine double-flowered strain of dazzling
colour; this grows to only 8-10cm high and is lovely in hanging
baskets, window boxes, borders and sunny rock gardens. Single mixed
is another showy plant with gorgeous colours. It grows exceedingly
well in hot, dry periods.
	   Portulaca blooms secrete honey and are insect-pollinated; there
are always bees and small insects hovering around the bright
blooms. Most species of portulaca have mucilaginous, often acidic
(malic acid) stems and foliage. Portulaca oleracea is edible and is
a pot herb.
	   Salvia
	   This is another garden annual popular in subtropical and warm
climates.
	   This brilliant bedding plant was once believed to have medicinal
properties and it derived its name from the Latin word salveo - to
heal.
	   Salvia splendens from Brazil can grow up to 30-45cm high in the
tropics.
	   Modern cultivations tend to be more compact.
	   `Blaze of Fire' is a variant of the splendens - the vivid red
bracts that hold the scarlet flowers are borne closely on long
spikes, and are spectacular in full bloom.
	   Other forms exist - white and mauve, to deep purple. These are
much sought-after for landscaped gardens.
	   Another, the blue salvia (Salvia farinacea), is another that can
be a centre of attraction amid reds. Salvia farinacea is the mealy
sage from Texas, with a flower like lavender's, of deep violet with
white wooly bracts and stems. This can grow to 60 cm high and is
ideal for cuttings for vases. It has oval, aromatic leaves, and is
excellent in open beds.

Butler headed for Baghdad this month for more weapons talks 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Under pressure to speed up U.N. weapons
inspections in Iraq, the chief U.N. inspector will travel to
Baghdad this month in a renewed effort to account for all the
banned weapons Iraq reportedly held before the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
	   U.N. sources said Richard Butler will hold talks June 13-14 with
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. Butler hopes to be
carrying a strong message from the Security Council that Iraq must
disclose more information about its weapons programs if it expects
to have crippling economic sanctions lifted.
	   But officials of the U.N. Special Commission, which performs the
inspections, admit privately they have lost ground in the political
battle to convince all 15 council members that serious gaps remain
between what Iraq is known to have held before the 1991 Gulf war
and what it claims to have destroyed.
	   The council imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. After a U.S.-led coalition drove the
Iraqis from Kuwait, the council decided to maintain sanctions until
the inspectors certify Iraq is free of all long-range missiles and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all illegal weaponry and that the
United States and Britain are manipulating the commission to keep
sanctions indefinitely. Russia, France and China are urging the
commission to accelerate its accounting of Iraqi weapons so that
sanctions can be ended.
	   Butler, an Australian, will attempt to shore up support when he
briefs the council Wednesday. U.N. officials say Butler will
present aerial photographs and other evidence to substantiate his
claims that Iraq has failed to account for significant portions of
its illegal arsenal.
	   To narrow the gap, Butler and his staff met last week at U.N.
headquarters with an Iraqi delegation which included Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a
senior adviser to Saddam.
	   ``Basically, the Iraqis gave us the same kind of explanations
they've given in the last year,'' said a U.N. source on condition
of anonymity. ``They claim to have provided all the documents to
the commission. The commission has different ideas.''
	   U.N. and Iraqi experts have been excavating sites near Baghdad
where the Iraqis say they destroyed missile warheads capable of
carrying chemical and biological agents.
	   The source said that operation brought the two sides ``close to
a full accounting'' on missile warheads. As a result, he said, the
commission may be able to end its missile inspections in October.
	   But the source said progress in accounting for Iraq's chemical
and biological weapons programs has been slower. For example, he
said, Baghdad has offered production records for 1988 and 1989 for
the deadly nerve agent VX. But the commission suspects Iraq was
able to produce several tons of VX in 1990.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A forensic expert has determined that a police
intelligence officer, reportedly stoned to death by students during
a demonstration at Juanda University campus in Bogor last month,
died of a heart attack.
	   Yuli Budiningsih of the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) Bogor
Hospital confirmed yesterday that Second Lt. Dadang Rusmana's death
on May 9 was due to a coronary.
	   ``We did not find any bruises on the back of his head. We found
only minor bruises in his nose and on his lips,'' Yuli told The
Jakarta Post.
	   Police have maintained Dadang died from a head injury sustained
after a rock was thrown at him by students. Yuli said the injuries
she found might be consistent with the 43-year-old falling
facefirst onto the ground.
	   Dadang was comatose when he was admitted to the hospital at 4:03
p.m. on the day of the incident, she said. ``He died about seven
minutes later.''
	   Yuli said she examined Dadang's body at 7 p.m.
	   National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar disputed that
Dadang's death was caused by a heart attack, insisting it was due
to mistreatment.
	   ``For the time being, police still consider that his death was
caused by torture,'' Da'i told the Post yesterday.
	   Dadang had tried to intervene to rescue a military intelligence
officer, Capt. Ali, from a student mobbing, when he was hit by a
rock thrown by protesters, police have maintained.
	   Ali remained hospitalized.
	   Students have insisted they attacked Ali because he entered the
university's mosque without removing his shoes outside.
	   They claim Dadang's body was not at the scene when they were
dispersed by hundreds of police and military officers who entered
the campus.
	   Lawyer Esther of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute said there was
a significant time difference between when the officers dispersed
the students and when the police announced they found Dadang dying
at the scene.
	   She did not rule the possibility the police put Dadang's body at
the scene after the students fled.
	   The university students and lecturers visited the National
Commission on Human Rights on Monday, complaining that police
tortured 12 students believed to be connected to the incident.
	   Lawyer Apong Herlina of the institute, who represented the
students, said students were forced to confess they beat Dadang to
death.
	   Nine of the students were released after being detained for
three days, while the other three were named as suspects in the
death of Dadang, she said.
	   Apong said one of the suspects, identified as Emon, was
paralyzed due to the torture inflicted during his time in custody
of the Bogor police precinct.
	   She said Friday that her office and the commission had received
copies of Dadang's autopsy results, which were different from the
police reports.
	   ``We will hold a press conference about it,'' she said.

	   APHIDS, or plant lice, are small, soft-bodied insects that feed
on plants by sucking out their fluids, or sap.
	   They are about the size of a small grain of rice. They range in
colour from pale green to red. They have a white woolly coating.
	   Often named for the type of plants they destroy, aphids survive
by sucking out the plant juices of soft and fleshy new growth. This
damages the plant's ability to process food.
	   You will usually find aphids among ornamental or fruit trees by
checking newly-formed leaves and buds. Distorted young leaves with
a grayish cast are sure signs of the pest's presence.
	   Aphids also excrete a sticky coating onto leaves.
	   These insects are easy to detect; turn over a damaged leaf and
you are sure to find a cluster of the culprits.
	   How they feed Aphids feed by sucking out plant sap with their
piercing mouth parts; they use slim, needle-sharp stylets in their
beaks, with which they pierce stems, leaves, buds, roots and fruit.
	   In badly-ravaged plants, aphids may cause leaves to curl or may
stunt a plant's growth. This will hinder its production of flower
or fruit.
	   Eventually, the plant may die.
	   Aphids also introduce fungi, bacteria and even viral diseases,
that can be as damaging as the aphids themselves.
	   Aphids expel, from the end of their abdomen, a rather sticky,
sweet substance called ``honeydew'', a favourite food of some
species of ants.
	   These ants move the aphids to productive plants, thus helping
spread the pests.
	   Control The first step to controlling aphids is inspecting new
growth for any tell-tale signs. You can wash off the slow-moving
pests with a slow jet of water from the garden hose.
	   For more serious infestations, use suitable insecticides
available at garden centres. Check the label carefully.
	   Other ways to fight aphids: Destroy them by hand - Rub an
infected leaf between thumb and forefinger. Be careful not to
damage leaves.
	   Wash them away - Mix insecticide with soap and use it to rinse
away the aphid population. Mala-thion will do the job. Sometimes,
insecticidal soap can be used to good effect - otherwise, mix your
own.
	   White oil - Abarol or albolenium are formulated to destroy
soft-bodied sucking insects. Follow instructions; exceeding the
recommended dosage can cause foliage burn.
	   Ladybirds are beneficial insects which feed on aphids. Ladybirds
and lacewings are natural enemies of aphids; in Nature, they and
other beneficial insects feed on aphids and their grubs.
	   Controlling ants is another way of putting an end to the menace,
because the ants spread aphids to healthy plants.
	   Ants are said to rub the bellies of the smaller insects, causing
them to excrete the ``honeydew'' the ants feed on. Spray plants
with an insecticide against ants.
	   Systemic insecticides Use systemic insecticides to control these
sucking pests more effectively. These are most commonly used to
fight aphids. Plants absorb these chemicals into their systems.
They do not harm plants, but when the aphids suck up the sap, they
quickly die.
	   Where sucking insects are concerned, ordinary contact
insecticides that control biting insects are useless because the
pests do not eat plant tissue, they suck only the sap through their
hollow needle-like mouths.
	   Rogor or Dime-thoate is a suitable systemic.
	   Whichever insecticide you choose, follow directions closely for
safe and effective use. Then wash your hands and face with lots of
water.

Russia slashes price for oil company it couldn't sell 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government lowered the price for the
Rosneft state oil company to dlrs 1.6 billion on Monday, after
failing to sell it last week for dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   The government wants to sell 75 percent of Rosneft, both to
raise much-needed cash and to show that its privatization program
is working.
	   Several oil companies indicated interest in Rosneft, Russia's
fifth largest oil company. But Russia's young stock market has
crashed since the sale was planned last fall and the price of oil
has also plummeted on world markets.
	   The sale was seen as a major test for President Boris Yeltsin's
new Cabinet, which has said it would carry out further
privatizations without bestowing any special favors on the
country's politically powerful commercial banks.
	   The sale was suspended last Tuesday when the government received
no bids. In announcing the new price of 9.8 billion rubles (dlrs
1.6 billion), Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko did not say how long
the bidding process would remain open this time.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Police arrested 16 alleged drug traffickers and
users in a raid Friday at a boarding house on Jl. Kebon Sayur,
Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta.
	   ``Some of them were heavily stoned when the police arrived. They
were having a heroin party'', said Capt. Sigit, the head of Tanah
Abang Police subprecinct.
	   Four of the suspects, assumed to be drug dealers, were
identified as Hardianto, 43, Anwar bin Asmawi, 27, Afrizal, 27 and
Bachrul Hairul alias Boy, 44.
	   From them officers confiscated 15 packages of heroin substitute
putaw, a marijuana cigarette, four packages of amphetamine
derivative shabu-shabu, a pair of scales, aluminum foil, plastic
spoons, matches and a tube of toothpaste.
	   The other 12 people, suspected of being drug users, were
identified as Stanley J. Maengkom, 25, a hotel academy student;
Taufik, 27, a private company employee; Syamsuri, 43, former
employee of state oil company Pertamina; Poltak P. Simanjuntak, 22,
a university student; Agus Wahyudi, 27, unemployed; Namin, 19, a
gas station attendant; Andi Tony, 26, a student; Dendy, 24, a
student; Indratama Djuned Poesponegoro, 25 a student; Daryl Sjahril
Djohan, 25, a private company employee; David Kristian Permadi, 25,
a student and Marsudi Utomo, 30, an employee at the Ministry of
Education and Culture.
	   The sixteen suspects had been under tight surveillance for about
three weeks.
	   ``Actually we were after a woman drug dealer. But she was not
there when we rounded them up,'' the head of the Tanah Abang
detective unit, First Lt. Ali Masduki told The Jakarta Post.
	   When police raided the boarding house, owned by a housewife
named Lany, all of the suspects were having a drug party, he said.
	   Some of them tried to run away through connecting doors and some
jumped from the second floor.
	   ``We were only nine. It was quite hard to arrest them all. Some
of them tried to attack the officers,'' Ali said.
	   But after the police gave three warning shots, the panicked
crowd gave up and all the partygoers were eventually packed into
small trucks and taken to the police station.
	   One of the alleged drug users, Indratama, a student whose father
is a university professor, admitted to having been carried away by
his friends' action.
	   ``Didn't you join the proreform demonstrations?'' asked a police
officer.
	   Indratama just looked up at the officer and smiled. He looked
heavily stoned, according to the police.
	   ``Some places in Tanah Abang are known for this kind of
activity. Therefore we always closely monitor the area,'' Sigit
said, adding that people would use boarding houses as their home
base.
	   About two weeks ago Tanah Abang police arrested four drug
dealers, two of whom were university students.
	   The head of the Central Jakarta Police Precinct, Lt. Col. Iman
Haryatna, confirmed the arrests Saturday.
	   ``We want to crack down on drug dealing because there are strong
indications that drug trafficking has spread to campuses over the
past four years and that it's getting worse,'' he said.
	   Iman also expressed concern over the growing number of students
who use drugs, especially in the city.
	   ``They should be fighting for better conditions, such as joining
the proreform campaigns or something else useful. These students do
not care whether this country is falling apart. Their parents must
be more active in supervising their behavior.''
	   In April police captured five alleged drug dealers who operated
on several campuses in Jakarta.

	   LESTER Technology Group Sdn Bhd, which provides solutions for
facilitating secure electronic transactions, is ready to capitalise
on the potentially lucrative business opportunities within and
outside Malaysian shores.
	   Towards that end, Lester Technology's chairman Mirzan Mahathir
said the company is keen on working with certification
authorisation bodies for making the cyberspace a secure place to
conduct transactions.
	   According to him, Lester Technology is in a market with immense
potential, and the target users for its products range from
Internet service providers (ISPs) and financial institutions, to
brokerage firms and large conglomerates.
	   ``And the fact that our products are locally made should appeal
well to local customers, who now have more than an able alternative
to those solutions which utilise foreign technology,'' he said in
Sungei Besi last week.
	   Mirzan was speaking at a Press conference in conjunction with
the launch of the company's global headquarters at the Mines
Waterfront Business Park.
	   The event was officiated by Energy, Telecommunications and Posts
Minister Datuk Leo Moggie. Also present was Lester Technology's
group chief executive Jerry T. Wu.
	   According to Lester Technology, business opportunities for
encryption technology products would be boosted by the explosive
growth of the electronic commerce market in the Southeast Asian
region and also around the globe.
	   The company says the public key infrastructure (PKI)-driven
worldwide market is expected to be worth an estimated US$200
billion (RM760 billion) by the year 2000. By that year, the
potential market for certification authorisation in Malaysia with
national root status will be about RM194 million.
	   Lester Technology had in December last year introduced the LTG
CA suite which is an encryption technology product for complete
Internet, intranet and extranet security.
	   The suite provides public key and private key encryption needed
for identification, authorisation and authentication of electronic
transactions. Information encrypted with a particular public key
can only be decrypted with its corresponding private key.
	   The LTG CA suite supports 128-bit symmetric algorithm and
1024/2048 Public Key algorithm.
	   According to Wu, there are about 50 players worldwide which are
dealing in encryption technology products, but Lester Technology
could be among the few to offer a comprehensive product range that
includes both enterprise certification authorisation (ECA) and
secure electronic transactions (SET) certification authorisation to
fully meet the security needs of the various users of the Internet.
He added that the company is currently conducting several pilots
with one local ISP and a few other organisations, which he termed
as ``potential certification authorisation''
	   bodies. On another development, Wu said Lester Technology will
submit its application for the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
status in a few weeks' time.

	   BOGOR (JP): Six out of nine Djuanda University students who were
reported missing after police raided their campus on May 9 returned
last week, a media report said Saturday.
	   The university's crisis center said it was looking into the
whereabouts of the remaining three, but those who had reappeared
were remaining tight-lipped and would not talk about their
experiences, Antara reported.
	   The three students still missing are Benyamin S, Hendra Sukma A
and Eti Suharyati, the center's spokesman M. Amin Soebianto said.
	   The center reported the students' disappearance to the National
Commission on Human Rights on May 23. The commission is scheduled
to visit the campus tomorrow.
	   The police raided the campus following the alleged fatal beating
by student demonstrators of Second Lt. Dadang Rusmana, chief of
Bogor Police intelligence.
	   Three students have been formally detained and university
officials have asked that the students be put them under house
arrest so that they can sit for their exams.

	   I FIRST made Professor Yuan T. Lee's acquaintance through his
five-page curriculum vitae. A notable scientist whose highest
achievement has been winning the 1986 Nobel prize for chemistry,
Lee's accomplishments consist of a seemingly endless list of
fellowships and awards, honorary appointments, academic positions
and lectureships.
	   Sixty-one-year-old Lee has recently opened a new chapter in his
life. After living in the United States for 32 years, four years
ago he gave up American citizenship and returned to his homeland,
Taiwan, and became president of Taipeh's prestigious Academia
Sinica.
	   ``I thought I would be too old if I didn't come home,'' he says,
laughing.
	   Lee left for the US to pursue a doctrate in chemistry in 1962,
and then dedicated his life to research.
	   His purpose in returning to the Far East was a noble one; he
hoped to raise the standard of research and improve the education
system in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.
	   ``If you work hard, you can conduct world-class research in
Southeast Asia,'' he says. ``I decided if I do not raise the
standard of chemistry research to the highest level in the world,
my returning to Taiwan won't mean very much.''
	   After six months as Academia Sinica president, Lee took up a new
challenge, heading the Council for Educational Reform; he has spent
two years working to improve education in Taiwan.
	   ``I believe people can be educated to change things for the
better,'' he says. ``But I can't do very much alone, and I hope to
persuade established scientists and academicians to get involved.''
	   Talking to Lee is like talking to a walking encyclopaedia. The
scope of his knowledge is vast, not limited to chemistry or
science. And he is a man of many concerns, especially in the
humanities, economics, social sciences and education.
	   He recently spoke at a seminar in Kuala Lumpur entitled ``Asian
financial shocks, high-technology and economic growth''. ``I'm not
an expert on the economy or monetary system, but I'm concerned
about the future of Southeast Asia - what we are doing and where
we're heading,'' says Lee.
	   ``Whenever I'm asked to do something, it is a challenge. I may
not know very much, but I learn. Life is a long learning process,''
he adds.
	   Lee was born in 1936 in Hsinchu, Taiwan, to an artist father and
schoolteacher mother. He had a colourful and fun-filled elementary
and secondary education in Hsinchu, where he was actively involved
in sports and music.
	   The turning point in his life came when he was 16.
	   ``I fell ill and was in hospital for a month. I was thinking to
myself what the meaning of life is and who I would become.''
	   An avid reader, Lee found the biography of Madame Curie
fascinating. It was Curie's dedication to science and her
selflessness and idealism that influenced him to study science.
	   ``For the first time, it hit me that you can achieve something
when you have ideals,'' says Lee. ``Madame Curie was a very
idealistic person who believed knowledge belongs to all
humankind.''
	   Aside from his ambition to become a scientist, Lee's other wish
was to change tradition and transform society.
	   ``China was so poor and there was much political unrest after
the war. I wasn't happy about the situation in society. I believe
there's a need to reform and change, and that we should work hard
to transform society.''
	   After completing his first and second degrees in chemistry in
Taiwan, he won a scholarship to pursue his doctorate at the
Univesity of California at Berkeley.
	   It was a very different but interesting experience for Lee and
wife Bernice Wu.
	   ``We came from closely-knit extended families. But in America,
we were uprooted and isolated; we knew nobody,'' says Lee. ``Then I
found I had all the time in the world for science.''
	   For the first four years, Lee was totally immersed in science
and forgot educational and social reformation. As there were few
Chinese students in America at the time, Lee put in his best to
prove that Chinese could do as well as Americans.
	   He developed an interest in crossed molecualr beams, studying
reaction dynamics. Upon receiving his Ph.D in 1965, he stayed to
conduct more experiments and research as a post-doctoral fellow,
under Professor Dudley Herschbach at Harvard.
	   Lee accepted a position as assistant professor in the chemistry
department of the University of Chicago in October 1968, and began
his illustrious academic career. From 1974 to 1991, Lee was
professor of chemistry there and at the University of California,
Berkeley.
	   He became an American citizen in 1974. His three children were
born in the United States.
	   In 1986, Lee won the Nobel prize for chemistry with his mentor
Herschbach and colleague John Polanyi, for the development of
chemical reaction dynamics.
	   But he confesses he never worked to win the prize.
	   ``I just wanted to be a good scientist and contribute to
society,'' he says. ``I was interested in solving problems and
doing things no one is able to. I do not believe anything is
impossible.
	   ``This is something young people do not understand. They look at
us and think we sacrifice so much time and energy. But I enjoy my
work immensely.
	   To me it is much more fun than going out and playing baseball.
When you carry out a successful experiment when no one in the world
knew it would work, it is really very exciting.''
	   Lee is one of five Chinese Nobel laureates in history and the
only one born in Taiwan and who has won in chemistry (the others
won for physics).
	   Winning the Nobel prize has changed his life.
	   ``A Nobel laureate is expected to be spokesperson for his field.
I was asked by the university, by the state of California, by the
US, and even by the government and people of Taiwan and China.''
Lee travelled around the world helping scientists in countries as
far-flung as Italy, France and Japan; he spoke at numerous
conferences and conventions.
	   ``I became very busy and was spending less time in the
laboratory,'' he says. ``On one hand I wanted to do more science,
but on the other I wanted to help people. My loyalty was even
questioned by the White House because I was helping the Taiwanese
government. Suddenly, I thought: `Jeez, things are getting so
complicated!'''
	   Lee then decided he should zero in on something, thus his plan
to leave America and return to Taiwan to promote scientific
research and education.
	   His decision was welcomed by many Asian intellectuals,
scientists and academicians.
	   ``When you work hard, it doesn't matter where you are as long as
you're contributing,'' he says.
	   ``It wouldn't make much of a difference if I serve in the United
States, as there are other great scientists. But by returning home,
my presence will make a difference in Taiwan.''

	   HENGELO, Netherlands: of Uganda.
	   The second world record attempt of the day proved a flop as
Australian Emma George failed to better her own record mark of 4.59
meters in the women's pole vault.
	   In fact, George couldn't clear the bar at all. She failed three
times at 4.30, the height she came in on.
	   And the same height won her American rival Stecey Dragila the
competition.

	   JAPANESE share prices closed 0.8 per cent lower yesterday with
market sentiment hit by Pakistan's nuclear tests and the yen's fall
against the dollar, brokers said.
	   The Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange dropped 125.77 points to close at 15,670.78, while
the broader Topix index of all first section issues edged down 2.24
points to 1,221.49.
	   Turnover on the major board totalled an estimated 320 million
shares, up from Thursday's 270.2 million shares.
	   Share prices lost direction after an early round of dealer-led
activity ran out of steam, with investors sidelined ahead of the
weekend, brokers said.
	   Earlier, the yen's sharp fall past 139 against the dollar
pressured the market, together with uncertainty over the Asian
economic and political situation following Pakistan's nuclear
tests, they said.
	   But share prices closed above a low of 15,604.70 thanks to
``buying support by public sector pension funds which bought into
high-weighting issues in banks and other sector leaders'', one
broker said.
	   The release of poor employment data, which showed the nation's
unemployment rate soared to a record high of 4.1 per cent, had a
limited impact on share prices, brokers said.
	   Slowing selling by foreign investors also helped share prices
move off their lows, with some foreign investors beginning to buy
into selected blue-chip issues with good earnings fundamentals,
they said.
	   But share prices failed to move into positive territory due to a
lack of follow-through buying, with a wait-and-see mood spreading
in the afternoon session ahead of the weekend, they said.

	   BEKASI (JP): Some 3,000 people lost their jobs here in the wake
of the massive rioting on May 14 because their places of work were
wreaked or burned down, an official said over the weekend.
	   They bring the number of people who have lost their jobs since
the economic crisis began last July to over 16, 400, said R.
Abdullah, secretary of the Bekasi All-Indonesia Workers Union
Federation.
	   He said the actual number could be much higher because not all
people losing employment had notified the union, Antara reported.
	   The union has formed a special team assigned to help jobless
people find employment in cooperation with the Bekasi mayor.
	   Among the projects the union has proposed is fish farming along
Kali Malang River and the provision of soft loans for the jobless
to start businesses.

	   SHARE prices closed up slightly on Wall Street on Thursday, but
gains were limited because traders were nervous about the
continuing troubles in Asia.
	   The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips rose 33.63 points (0.38 per
cent) to 8,970.20 on bargain-hunting. Share prices rose and fell
throughout the day.
	   The market closed down 27 points on Wednesday, after sliding 175
points one day previously because of unease over Asia's economic
woes and its consequences for US companies.
	   Then on Thursday, the US government revised upward its estimate
on US economic growth for the first quarter from an annualised 4.2
per cent to 4.8 per cent as strong consumer and business spending
was offset by a weak trade sector due to the Asian financial
problem.
	   But growth is expected even as export sales to Asia shrink,
analysts said.
	   Exports have also been reduced since the dollar is at its
highest level against the yen in eight years, making Japanese goods
relatively less expensive, said John Lonski, the principal
economist for the Wall Street rating firm Moody's.
	   On the bond market, the average yield of the US Treasury
Department's benchmark 30-year bonds remained stable at 5.832 per
cent down from 5.837 per cent.
	   Among the gainers, Boeing rose 3/8 to 46-13/13 despite
announcing Wednesday that its business would be hurt by Asia's
economic woes.
	   Banking issues rose, with Citicorp up 1-1/16 to 150 and
NationsBank was up 13/16 at 76. Chrysler rose up 2-3/16 to 56-15/16
after the annual meeting of Daimler-Benz shareholders. Daimler rose
4-9/16 to 100-1/2.

Dengue fever cases begin downward trend, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): A predicted dengue fever outbreak peak, which was
expected to happen in May or June, will unlikely be realized as
number of sufferers has sharply decreased, an official said
yesterday.
	   The City Health Office's public relations department head,
Maryani, said the number of dengue fever patients in the city as of
May 31 reached only 1,700, a sharp drop compared to 6,600 as of the
end of April.
	   She said the total number of the dengue patients throughout the
city so far this year was 10,700, with 83 deaths.
	   The fall in the number of people infected is due mainly to city
residents' aggressive activities to eradicate the habitats of Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes, the carriers of the dengue virus.
	   ``It is also due to the end of the rainy season, when there is
less flooding, which helps spread the mosquitoes' breeding,'' she
told The Jakarta Post.
	   The dengue fever outbreak reached its highest level in April,
when hospitals and health centers were swamped with patients.
	   To help prevent the spread of dengue, the city administration
launched a mass movement in April to fight the disease.
	   Maryani said that even though the peak of the outbreak was
believed not to materialize, people should remain on alert.
	   ``We hope people won't stop the mosquitoes' habitat eradication
program,'' she said.
	   Based on the Post's observations yesterday, hospitals were no
longer as full with dengue fever patients as in April, when many
had to be treated in hospital corridors due to limited availability
of rooms.
	   ``We treated about 20 to 25 dengue patients a day in April. But
now there are only about five people a day at most,'' said Bambang
D., a doctor at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Central
Jakarta.
	   An employee at state Fatmawati Hospital, South Jakarta, said the
situation was back to normal, so the dengue fever alert post at the
hospital was removed last week.
	   ``The post was established to anticipate a steadily rising
number of patients at the hospital. Now, however, we consider the
post is no longer needed,'' said the employee, who asked not to be
named.
	   A similar situation was also seen at St. Carolus Hospital,
Central Jakarta. Nurse Citra D. said that in April, the number of
new dengue fever patients reached dozens per day but ``it's about
two or three a day now.''

<TEXT>
	   THIS gargantuan film (we're talking about the hype surrounding
it, not its merit!) can be summed up in two words: physical
tragedy.
	   It has special effects that are nothing less than stunning and,
ermmm, nothing else much.
	   The story revolves around Godzilla making its way to New York,
leaving the usual, if uninspired, trail of destruction.
	   Supporting this computer-generated imagery (CGI) Godzilla are
Matthew Broderick in the lead as nuclear scientist Dr Nick
Tatopoulos; Jean Reno as French spy Philippe Roche; Hank Azaria as
a cameraman named Animal and Maria Pitillo as the pitiful Audrey -
pitiful because she is forced upon an unsuspecting audience.
	   None of these cardboard cutouts adds any originality to their
performances.
	   However - strangely - it must be confessed that Azaria has more
screen presence than Broderick. And Godzilla in turn, has more than
all of them put together.
	   Safe to say, throughout this feeding tube of a movie, the only
pondering viewers are apt to do is to ask why Godzilla chose New
York.
	   And even then, this could be easily attributed to the
re-awakening of some long dormant and ancient instinct, probably
memories of the prehistoric supercontinent, Pangaea, or something
like that.
	   Then again, it could also be the attraction of the trendy
lifestyle in the city that never sleeps and its superb skyline. One
can never be sure about these things nowadays! Anyway, for an
audience weaned on Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park and its sequel,
The Lost World, or the CGI-laden box-office bomb Dragonheart,
there's nothing new or groundbreaking in Godzilla in terms of
special effects, except maybe for the creature, which even then
looks like a cross between the artist H.R. Giger's Alien and a
scowling T-Rex (Jurassic Park).
	   Godzilla is basically a pastiche of other blockbusters - Godzie
downtown is like Mrs T-Rex in San Diego looking for her little one
in The Lost World; Godzie underwater is like the swimming aliens in
Alien Resurrection; Godzie being target practised upon is like King
Kong, and, of course, landmarks going down is similar to what
happened in Independence Day (ID4).
	   Surprisingly, the first teasing glimpses of the gigantic CGI
creature's tail and feet as it runs swerving behind one building or
another seem so unreal and do not mesh with the surrounding.
	   Only in the darkened scenes (underground tunnels, underwater or
during nighttime) does the mighty CGI Godzilla look believable.
	   One thing that really needs saying is the mannerism of the
towering beast, which is very real, especially when its suspicions
are aroused as the humans try and bait it for the second time.
	   The single most memorable scene has to be when the creature
dives into the sea to escape its pesky tormentors, only to face
armed submarines.
	   Also striking are the scenes depicting Godzilla's flammable
breath, if that's what it is, in two incidences.
	   As for scale, this Godzilla is sometimes dwarfed by the tall
buildings in New York.
	   It does not often come across the way the hulking Godzilla of
yore did in those kitschy Japanese shows that we used to see on
television long ago.
	   It must be said that for a nation that has been tracking the
beast, the US sure is ill-prepared to grapple with the situation
when Godzilla comes a-calling.
	   And where is the camcorder brigade that is always in every nook
and cranny capturing everything on video for posterity Stateside?
The only first glimpse of Godzilla that the New Yorkers see on
their tellys are bad visuals taken by Animal.
	   For those looking for a huge dose of destruction in the exact
same vein as dished out in ID4 in 1996, it'll be good to hear that
New York's landmarks are destroyed willy nilly.
	   For dessert, there is the squadron of helicopters swarming in on
Godzilla, only to be outsmarted and crunched by the beast during
the first round of their encounter.
	   Unlike ID4 (made by the same director-producer team of Roland
Emmerich and Dean Devlin), this film's weakness is that it does not
have memorable characters with whom audiences can emotionally lock
onto.
	   Godzilla's cutesy characters spewing effortlessly-digestable
inanities pale in comparison to ID4's screen magnet Will Smith.
	   If the serious anti-nuclear message at the core of the movie
does not come across, the blame must squarely fall on the
filmmakers who have sacrificed substance (in the screenplay) for
cheesy lines.
	   It is sad that the film leaves no room for its characters to
ponder on the folly of their ways although it is firmly established
that Godzilla is the mutated result of the undersea nuclear testing
conducted by the French.
	   Everyone in the film takes Godzilla to be the bad guy who must
be destroyed.
	   The creature eats fish, for Godssake - he does not go around
chomping people. Well... except for a few misplaced stomps here and
there.
	   While we're at it, the soundtrack is not memorable at all and
neither is the creature's vocal performance.
	   Verdict: This is a morally-unsound movie - a true-blue denizen
of the 90s would be appalled when the actors on screen applaud as
Godzilla collapses at the end.
	   Folks, this year's event movie just got dumber.

	   HENGELO, Netherlands (AP) _ Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie
bettered the men's 10,000 meter world record by five seconds
Monday, finishing in 26 minutes 22.77 seconds at the Adriaan Paulen
Memorial track meet.
	   He shattered the nine-month old mark of 26:27.85 set by Kenyan
Paul Tergat in Brussels on August 27 last year.
	   Gebrselassie ran the last ten laps of the track with only lapped
runners for company after the last of the five Ethiopian pacemakers
he'd brought along dropped back.
	   The Ethiopian clocked a half-way split time of 13:11.53 over the
first five kilometers.
	   Gerbrselassie made the most of a sunny and almost windless early
evening here, and encouragement from lapped compatriot Habte Jifar,
who chased him round the final circuit.
	   Earlier in the meet, African male athletes scored three
season-best times over the middle distances.
	   Kenyan Wilson Boit Kipketer set a 3,000-meters time of 7:36.05,
besting Moroccan Brahim Lahlafi in a close finish.
	   And there was a Kenyan 1-2-3 in the 3000 meters steeplechase as
Bernard Barmassai came home in 8:11.57, ahead of Julius Chelule and
Patrick Sang.
	   Barmassai's time sliced 8.29 seconds off American Mark Croghan's
previous best time of this season.
	   And it was the turn of Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj to lead the
world this year in the 1,500 meters, winning in 3:31.19, some way
ahead of Frenchman Nadir Bosch and Julius Achon of Uganda.
	   The second world record attempt of the day proved a flop as
Australian Emma George failed to better her own record mark of 4.59
meters in the women's pole vault.
	   In fact, George couldn't clear the bar at all. She failed three
times at 4.30, the height she came in on.
	   And the same height won her American rival Stecey Dragila the
competition.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A Korean and an Indonesian were killed when their
car collided with a truck in Cawang, East Jakarta, early Saturday,
hospital sources said.
	   Another three Koreans, identified only as Soon, Rhe and Lee,
were critically injured and were treated at the Indonesian
Christian University (UKI) hospital at Cawang.
	   The dead were identified as Lee Euw Sam, 36 and the car driver,
Saiman Basri, 43. Lee died on the scene and Saiman in the hospital.
	   According to Duyeh Supandi, the personnel manager of PT Klapa
Nunggal at Cileungsi in Bogor, West Java, where all the victims
worked, the five were on their way to the metal factory from Hotel
Indonesia in Central Jakarta when the accident happened.
	   ``They had to reach the factory early in the morning and start
work before other employees did,'' he said.
	   Duyeh said that all the Koreans arrived in Indonesia several
days ago.
	   The bodies of Lee and Saiman were sent to Cipto Mangunkusumo
General Hospital for postmortems.
	   Saiman's wife, Sukarti, said that she received a call from the
factory at about 9 a.m. on Saturday, telling her that her husband
was in critical condition at UKI hospital.
	   Sukarti went there but missed her husband's body, which had
already been moved to Cipto Mangunkusumo. She could not hold back
tears when visiting Saiman's body accompanied by her relatives.
	   ``We will bury him at Ratu Jaya in Depok,'' she said.
	   Saiman is survived by five children, aged between seven and 19.
	   Sukarti, a resident of Sukma Jaya district in Depok, West Java,
said that her husband had worked for the factory for four years.
	   ``I hope that the factory will help us support the family. I
have no idea how to pay the children's school fees,'' she said.

	   MALAYSIAN Airline System Bhd recorded a group pre-tax loss of
RM225.36 million for the year ended March 31, 1998, from a pre-tax
profit of RM349.56 million previously.
	   At the company level, pre-tax loss stood at RM226.25 million
against a pre-tax profit of RM328.23 million previously.
	   After providing for taxation of RM31.27 million, the group's
after-tax loss was RM256.64 million while group loss per share was
33.7 sen from a group earnings per share of 43.8 sen last year.
	   Group turnover grew 8.7 per cent to RM7.051 billion and
investment and other income dropped by one per cent to RM102.69
million.
	   Group cashflow per share improved by 76 sen or 52.1 per cent
from RM1.46 to RM2.22.
	   MAS said in a statement performance was affected by the decline
in traffic demand, escalation of costs and foreign exchange losses,
particularly in the second half due to the economic situation in
the region and the weak ringgit.
	   The group suffered a translation loss of RM3.487 billion
compared to a translation gain of RM164.2 million last year, on
revaluation of long-term foreign monetary assets and liabilities.
	   However, as the borrowings were mainly to finance the
acquisition of aircraft, the costs of which were denominated in the
US dollar, the appreciation in aircraft book value was
approximately RM4.8 billion at RM3.64 to US$1.
	   The statement said as only translation loss for long-term
foreign assets and liabilities were amortised, an exchange loss of
RM620.9 million was booked in.
	   During the year, the group also incurred an exchange loss of
RM97.5 million on operating transactions, provided RM165.2 million
for doubtful debts and RM48.6 million for its Year 2000 Compliance
programme.
	   The statement said in the year under review, the group entered
into sale and leaseback arrangement for 11 aircraft and seven spare
engines and sold an Airbus A300B. These transactions resulted in a
total gain of RM620 million.
	   A gain of RM136.9 million was also derived from divestment of
aircraft engine repair and overhaul business unit to an associated
company.
	   During the year under review, MAS took delivery of six B777-200,
three B747-400, one B737-400 aircraft and deferred the deliveries
of three B747- 400 aircraft.
	   The statement also said that MAS' capacity, inclusive of
freighter operation, expanded 4.3 per cent to 6,411.3 million
tonne-kilometres while traffic grew at a rate of 4.9 per cent to
3,887.7 million tonne-kilometres.
	   Overall load factor improved by 0.3 percentage points to 60.6
per cent while passenger load declined 1.7 percentage points to
67.9 per cent.
	   The airline's outlook for the current financial year was that
demand for air travel would remain weak.
	   It said the economic problems in the Asian region would affect
intra-Asian travel while outbound traffic from Malaysia and
domestic travel would drop further if the economic situation did
not improve.
	   However, the statement added, the undervalued ringgit, the 16th
Commonwealth Games in September and some other major international
events should encourage inbound traffic into Malaysia and also
enhance awareness of the country for future travel.
	   Expected keen competition will continue to exert pressure on
yield.
	   Costs are expected to remain high.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The sky over the city is blue once again. There is
no more gray smoke rising from burning shops, houses and offices as
was the case during the recent riots.
	   But grief still hangs in the air. It is as black as the gutted
remains of buildings, silent witnesses to the looting and burning
of more than 5,000 shops and malls.
	   Most of the property belonged to Indonesians of Chinese descent.
	   Hendrawan is one of the many victims who lost his source of
income within a matter of hours. His shop in Pasar Minggu, South
Jakarta, where he sold spare parts for cars, was set ablaze by
looters on May 14.
	   Sifting through what remains of his shop, he collects blackened
spare parts and uses both hands to dust off the ashes.
	   ``I want to start my business again but I don't know whether
it's possible,'' Hendrawan, who returned from his hometown in
Purwokerto, Central Java, last week, said.
	   Before he started selling spare parts in Pasar Minggu six years
ago, Hendrawan ran a car repair shop from his house. He decided to
turn it into another business with the hope of making a better
living.
	   He bought a 20-square-meter shop worth Rp 65 million after
obtaining a 10-year loan with his house as collateral.
	   ``I still have to figure out how to pay my loan for the next
four years, or the bank will confiscate my home,'' the 41-year-old
father of four said.
	   At the moment, he is preparing the necessary documents, such as
those from the district office and the fire department, to persuade
the bank not to confiscate his home. He had no insurance for loss
or damage of the shop and stock.
	   ``I need more time before I can continue paying my loan.''
	   Getting another loan is out of the question.
	   ``See for yourself, how can I convince a bank to give me a loan
now? Maybe I will try to persuade my relatives to give me a loan to
restart my business, but, under the present conditions, it won't be
easy.''
	   In the meantime, Hendrawan must find a way to put food on the
table for his wife, who does not work, and their children.
	   ``With no business to run, I don't know how long I can go on
living like this.''
	   Indonesia's ethnic Chinese, who account for 5 percent of the 200
million people here but are said to dominate the economic sector,
are often the scapegoats for public anger.
	   During the recent riots, many stayed in their homes as they had
no place to go. The wealthy ones managed to flee to other
countries, some holed up in the Thousand Islands and at
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, while others stayed with
relatives or friends in a place they considered safer.
	   Now that the situation is cooling down, some have already
returned to the city -- only to find debris instead of the houses,
offices, or stores they left behind.
	   Lina Herlina, 45, another Indonesian of Chinese descent who ran
a grocery store at Pasar Minggu market, has no plans to continue
her business.
	   Starring at her gutted store, she could identify nothing but a
blackened iron chair and shelves.
	   ``I don't think I will start my business again, I don't have
money to start again, this is all I had,'' Lina, who managed to get
out of her store when the mobs started looting the market, said.
	   ``My priority now is how to survive the situation.''
	   Only two months ago she paid up the three-year rent for the
shop. Now her family must depend solely on her husband's small
salary as a bookkeeper at a pharmacy.
	   ``I was trying to start my own business to earn extra money for
raising my children.
	   ``And I still don't understand why they burned down my shop,''
Lina said, adding that she had a good relationship with other shop
owners and customers living near the market.
	   Maintaining a good relationship with neighbors is a must,
especially if you belong to the minority. But during the recent
riots this rule did not apply, primarily because there were
allegations that those who started the incidents were people from
outside the area.
	   Unity
	   Several eyewitnesses saw the same people inciting the riots,
according to Rosita Sofjan Noer, businesswoman and deputy chair of
the Coordinating Body for National Unity (Bakom-PKB). They saw
those people unlock stores and shops with special ``cutters''
before provoking the mobs to loot and burn.
	   She believed the looting was well-organized and urged the Armed
Forces to thoroughly investigate the case.
	   ``The Armed Forces has to start determining who was behind these
riots.''
	   Bakom is a forum of public figures from various ethnic groups
established in 1977 to promote national unity.
	   They members include tycoon Liem Sioe Liong, alias Soedono
Salim, and his son Anthony Salim, hotelier Sukamdani Sahid
Gitosardjono, banker Usman Admadjaja, scholar Juwono Sudarsono,
researcher Harbrinderjit Singh Dilon, scholar Bachtiar Aly, and
businessman K. Sindhunatha.
	   Rosita said the recent tragedy reflected a decline in society's
sense of unity and nationalism. The looting and burning of stores,
shops and malls belonging to those of Chinese descent revealed the
social jealousy of certain groups.
	   Like many people, the rioters believed the inaccurate stereotype
that all Chinese are rich. The fact that many of those rich people
prefer to live exclusively and do not want to mix with the
indigenous people adds to their animosity.
	   Rosita said Bakom had assigned 80 people to gather data about
the number of victims and the material loses.
	   ``The data is expected to enable related ministries to determine
the necessary steps to help the victims.''
	   No less important is the government's efforts to protect all
citizens, regardless of their ethnic background, to create a
feeling of safety and certainty, she said.
	   ``It's important to give them a feeling of certainty and safety
before they rebuild their businesses,'' Rosita said.
	   Chinatown
	   President B.J. Habibie last week toured Jakarta's Chinatown in
Glodok, West Jakarta, and the shopping centers in Klender, East
Jakarta, and Cempaka Putih, Central Jakarta, all of which were
damaged in the riots.
	   He promised that the government would help traders in all
possible ways. He also convinced traders of Chinese descent of the
government's intent to provide equal treatment for all.
	   His words have yet to become reality, but many have great
expectations of him.
	   Amir Tjipta, one of the traders, has started cleaning up his
gutted store in the Glodok electronics market.
	   ``I've started cleaning up my store because now I feel secure
after the President himself paid us a visit,'' he said.
	   Glodok was the worst-hit area during the recent riots. Over
3,800 kiosks and a 150-room hotel were burned and looted in the
neighborhood. About 65 people died in fires in a number of Glodok
shopping malls, while 45 others were seriously injured.
	   Amir wishes he could soon restart his business.
	   ``Being a trader is the only thing I know but now, with my shop
gone, I have to start all over again. And I really hope that the
President will not forget his promise to help us,'' said the man,
who has three children and a wife to support.
	   He expects the President to help traders get bank loans. ``I put
all my money into my store and I don't have enough savings to start
again,'' Amir said.
	   If he fails to get a loan, he would be forced to wind up his
operations completely. ``Maybe I will try to get money to renovate
the store and then sell it. But, in the current situation, I know
it's not easy,'' said Amir.
	   The city administration has promised to speed up the processing
of permits for renovations to buildings destroyed during last
week's rioting.
	   The West Jakarta mayoralty even said that victims of the riots
could rebuild without a permit. In South Jakarta, they are allowed
to do so, on the condition that the design of the new building is
the same as the old one.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Before facing the current economic
problems, Asia's dynamic economic growth, dubbed the Asian Miracle,
provided its citizens with a success which lulled them to
complacency.
	   ``It is common knowledge the manner Asians were shopping at
shopping centres of the world ... Paris, Milan, London, New York,''
former Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Musa Hitam said.
	   ``They were shopping like their counterparts who came from far
more developed economies with little concern for being frugal. We
didn't know how to manage monies ourselves ...'' he said.
	   ``Currently, many of us, are reeling from this trouble.
Indonesia, Korea Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore ... all of us are
feeling it,'' Musa, who is chairman of Lion Land Berhad, said.
	   He said this when closing the four-day Harvard Project for Asian
and International Relations conference at the Putra World Trade
Centre today.
	   Musa said the theme for this year's conference was apt as it
enabled the participants to understand the issues at hand.
	   ``If this (the conference) was organised several years ago ...
the theme would have been different.
	   ``Our (the nations') dynamism brought streams of people from the
international community who came and viewed us with awe.
	   ``We had people who had nothing but good things to say about us
... the Asian way.''
	   But success breeds arrogance, corruption, decadence and
failures.
	   ``We became too rich too fast ... suffering from success which
bred failures.''
	   The cultural shock from that failure was traumatic.
	   However, countries in the region had reacted with an acceptance
of responsiblity for the problem and taken remedial action
immediately.
	   ``There are some countries that indulge in the denial syndrome
... yet are forced to take remedial action grudgingly.
	   ``There are those who deal with the problem with cool acceptance
of the reality of the situation, adopting a no-nonsense approach
towards remedial action and getting on with the job at hand to put
their act together.''
	   Musa said one aspect not mentioned much in the wake of the
downturn, and which could be regarded as positive, was the human
rights issue.
	   ``Being an international activist in the cause, in the present
social, economic scenario, the human rights cause seems to be the
winner here,''
	   Musa, who heads the Malaysian delegation to the 54th session of
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): The departure of Soeharto as Indonesia's president
will likely be followed by the emergence of new political forces
and the decline of old established ones.
	   To use the famous terminology of the late president Sukarno, the
New Emerging Forces (Nefos) will be in the ascent, and the Old
Established Forces (Oldefos) will be on the descent.
	   The rise of Amien Rais as a prominent figure in the opposition
camp is a sign of this tendency. And it is not unlikely that other
personalities representing new political forces will emerge before
too long.
	   On the other side of the political spectrum, it is becoming
increasingly apparent that certain personalities from the old New
Order are loosing their appeal with the public and are struggling
hard to keep their heads above water by performing political
acrobatics.
	   Maurice Barres, a French novelist and politician had an
interesting remark about political acrobats. He said, ``The
politician is an acrobat. He keeps his balance by saying the
opposite of what he does.''
	   Some of these political acrobats sound sincere in their
``repentance'' but most sound hollow and cheap. Totally
unconvincing. At the moment it is still unclear who among these old
political personalities will survive, and who will definitely have
to go.
	   To a great extent, the survival of these old political players
depends on their ability to shift from the old political language
to the new one, the language of reform.
	   Those who sincerely believe in democracy will have no difficulty
in speaking this new language, but those who deep in their hearts
still believe in the politics of indoctrination and repression to
preserve power will have great difficulty in speaking the language
of reform.
	   What will the new political landscape look like? It is still too
early to talk about the configuration of the coming political
forces. One thing is sure, however, that the existing system
comprising three political groupings -- the United Development
Party (PPP), Golkar, and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
--will not suffice to accommodate the political forces that exist
in the Indonesian cultural soil, whether active or dormant.
	   My guess is that there will be more political forces coming into
existence both in the ``Islamic'' camp, represented now by PPP, and
in the ``democratic'' camp, represented now by the practically
paralyzed PDI.
	   The Megawati-Soeryadi divide in this camp has become an
irrelevance and the urgent task this camp has to perform is to
demonstrate that it can regroup and consolidate itself fast enough
to take an active and intelligent part in the next round of the
country's political life.
	   What will happen to Golkar? Will it be able to preserve its
present hegemony or will it experience a gradual reduction in its
political significance?
	   I don't know. It depends on how Golkar is going to define itself
politically in these coming days. If it cannot get rid of its
present image that it is the party of the bureaucrats, I think it
will soon disintegrate. Bureaucrats and a government bureaucracy
can never evoke an appealing image among the public.
	   If, however, Golkar can convincingly show that it is converting
itself into a party of ``politically independent professionals'' --
as the name implies -- then perhaps it will be able to attract the
sympathy of a new generation of potential politicians who have lost
their faith in the old political personalities, in the old
political parties and in the old political system.
	   But creating this image is not an easy task. Professionalism
without political coloring has never been an image that Golkar can
create in the public mind. Golkar has always been perceived as a
political creature of the ruling elite.
	   How will the political make-up of the ``Islamic'' and
``democratic'' camps change?
	   On the Islamic side, it has been felt for a long time that PPP
cannot attract all Islamic forces in the country into its fold.
Especially after it has been clearly demonstrated that the PPP
leadership is not sensitive toward certain political aspirations of
today's Indonesian Moslems.
	   In addition, it should not be forgotten that Nahdlatul Ulama
(NU) has always been a political force within our society. Even
though its current formal status is not a political party, no one
can deny the influence of NU as the biggest socio-religious
organization in shaping the political opinion and attitudes of a
large group of Moslems.
	   And if we look at the political dynamics within the various
associations of Islamic students we discover that new political
strains among them cannot possibly be accommodated by the present
PPP. They will have to build their own political house. PPP will be
able to lure them into its camp only if it can alter its image as a
``domesticated'' political group.
	   In the democratic camp new forces have already emerged. The
Indonesian Democratic Union Party (PUDI) under Sri Bintang
Pamungkas and the People's Democratic Party (PRD) under Bambang
Sudjatmiko are such new forces. Whether they will be able to find
roots within society at large remains to be seen.
	   In addition there are other democratic forces around labor
leader Mochtar Pakpahan and among journalists who gathered -- and
are going to gather, I hope -- around the ``illegal'' Association
of Independent Journalists.
	   Basically the factor that makes the formation of new democratic
forces possible and desirable is the organizational and managerial
weakness of PDI. Since its inception this party has been marked by
continuous internal rivalries and infighting.
	   It has been known for quite a time that there are new groups of
political activists which are strongly inclined toward democracy
but somewhat hesitant to join PDI.
	   These groups have a common feeling that PDI -- and for them PDI
is Megawati -- is less than sufficiently intellectually
stimulating. These groups have also to build their own democratic
parties.
	   What I envisage for the immediate future is a more varied
political panorama. That is if the new law on political parties is
sufficiently free and liberal, and does not include restrictive or
repressive clauses.
	   According to Henry Adams ``Modern politics is, at bottom, a
struggle not of men but of forces. The men become every year more
and more creatures of force, massed about central powerhouses.''
	   The art of managing these forces, according to Adams, is to
ensure that these political powerhouses do not become organizations
that systematically exploit prejudices, dislikes, and hatred.
Genuine democracy can be built only on mutual trust and
consultation.
	   This is, I think, a maxim which future political leaders have to
keep in mind.
	   The writer is an observer of social and political affairs.

	   As Indonesians intensify their demands for total reform in all
areas in the wake of Soeharto's resignation, pure democracy based
on Pancasila and the Constitution of 1945 must be implemented. This
will involve limiting the role of the Armed Forces in order that
nobody gets the impression that the country is ruled in an
authoritarian or totalitarian manner by the power holder.
	   During the transitional period, which may last until 2003, the
dual function of the Armed Forces in Indonesia is still needed
because it is expected to play a role in establishing stability in
the community and also ensure that the public maintain their
dynamism for the sake of democracy.
	   The leadership of the Armed Forces must introduce a fresh way of
thinking and a new operational method, namely moving from taking
preventive and repressive measures against the people and develop a
craving for reform and the courage to fight against the Soeharto
regime by allowing opportunities for reform to be carried out
constitutionally. It is in fact the duty of the Armed Forces to
safeguard decisions made by the government and by the House of
People's Representatives/People's Consultative Assembly (DPR/MPR)
in the context of implementing reforms in all areas.
	   However, it is now the right time for the very broad function of
the Armed Forces to be reduced. The following may serve as examples
of possible reductions:
	   1. The Armed Forces must take a neutral stance and be impartial
toward any groups and political parties existing at present and in
the coming election. It must be able to take a middle position and
protect everyone.
	   The Armed Forces must stop fostering mass organizations usually
believed to be attached to it. These organizations must be
independent from the Armed Forces and must no longer get political
and logistic support from the Armed Forces.
	   The Armed Forces need no longer mobilize forces in the
community. Of course, it is always possible, for example, for wives
of members of the Armed Forces and retired Armed Forces members to
set up their own associations but only as long as these are
established for welfare purposes.
	   2. The Armed Forces must reduce the number of its members
assuming civilian positions, such as governors, district heads,
mayors, directors general and so forth. These positions must be
returned to civilians; Armed Forces members should take up civilian
posts only if such posts are considered vulnerable if left to
civilians or if there are no civilians capable of assuming such
posts.
	   Armed Forces members must stop having such an arrogant attitude
and doing what they please simply because they have the power to do
so. They must now really take the people's interests into account.
	   During the Soeharto regime examples abounded of how certain
members of the Armed Forces acted in ways not befitting them but
got away unpunished. Of course Minister of Home Affairs Lt. Gen.
Syarwan Hamid and Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto must now rid
the Armed Forces of such members.
	   3. The Armed Forces must not take part in the coming general
election to ensure their neutrality. The number of Armed Forces
members in the DPR must be reduced to only a maximum of 10 percent
of the total number of the DPR members, considering that the Armed
Forces serves only to create stability and social dynamism.
	   4. Finally, the leadership of the Armed Forces must have the
courage to take firm action against certain elements of their
subordinates who were indisciplined and violated laws and human
rights during the Soeharto regime.

	   THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council hopes to get the
geographical information system (GIS) ready by August to provide
contractors with up- to-date information on underground pipes,
cables and wiring.
	   Its president Datuk Mohamad Nor Bador said the council was
currently carrying out a pilot project in Section 52 and the Old
Town area.
	   He said the pilot project would take some time as the council
was gathering information from utility departments.
	   He said the utility departments would update the council on
pipes, cables and underground wiring.
	   ``We have to get all the information first before we can provide
the GIS service. Once we know the layout of pipes and underground
cables, it will be easier for us to put all information into the
computer.
	   ``The pilot project will let us know the shortcomings of our
study. Once we have completed the pilot project in Section 52, it
will be easier for us to carry out studies in other areas,'' he
added.
	   Mohamad Nor said contractors can get up-to-date information
before carrying out excavation or drilling.
	   However, contractors will have to purchase the GIS to get the
information.
	   Kelana Jaya State Assemblyman Datuk Mokhtar Dahlan said it was
important for the council to have the GIS system as there were many
incidents of burst pipes in Petaling Jaya.
	   He said contractors were not responsible when carrying out their
work, resulting in burst pipes.
	   ``Most of the pipes are very old and slight pressure on them
will cause a major damage. With the water shortage, we do not need
another burst pipe.
	   ``The council should implement the GIS as soon as possible so
that contractors can buy the plans from us and carry out work
without problem,''
	   he added.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees from Serbia's
Kosovo province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to
escape some of the deadliest fighting in months. Dozens of people
were reported killed.
	   Albania appealed to the United States and European Union to
intervene in what it said was a ``massacre'' in Kosovo.
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragic dimensions,'' the
Albanian government said in a statement.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the bloodshed appeared the worst since
March, when Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on militants among the ethnic Albanian majority in
Serb-ruled Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of villages near the border with Albania.
He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars being fired into the
villages.
	   Refugees said a 3-year-old child died en route to Albania.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians were killed over the
weekend. Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were
killed when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 45
miles west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Serb sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The fierce fighting forced about 2,000 Kosovo Albanians _ mostly
women, children and the elderly _ across the border into Albania's
Tropoja (pronounced Tro-POH-yah) region on Sunday and Monday,
Albania said. They said more were arriving by the hour.
	   In Tropoja, some refugees said they had walked for up to 20
hours to reach the Albanian town. They said Serb tanks were
positioned inside Decani, and that Serb forces were besieging the
town.
	   Tropoja, although some three miles inside Albanian territory,
resembled a community under siege, with most of the men carrying
rifles or other weapons. Some men displayed the insignia of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the militant Kosovo organization
spearheading the fight against Serbia.
	   Andrew Harper, a U.N. aid worker, said he purchased three tons
of flour, rice and other basics on the local market to provide for
the refugees, and more aid was expected from Tirana, the Albanian
capital, on Tuesday.
	   ``I am very worried about providing for all these people,'' said
Isa Memia, the town leader. ``We have grave (supply) problems
ourselves, but they are our kinsmen, and we will help them.''
	   Authorities in Serbia are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The conflict has killed more than 200 people in Kosovo since the
beginning of March. About half of the province is believed
controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked off,
either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 15 miles
west of Pristina. It said one had had his throat slit.
	   According to the ethnic Albanians' account, Serb police burst
into Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to, ``Go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in the
Yugoslav federation.

	   However, a two-litre container of Kleenfloor was RM10.90 at
Super Kinta; RM11.40 at Ocean and RM9.95 at Jaya Jusco.
	   For other items, the differences in price were only marginal.
	   In Johor Baru, Tops supermarket in Plaza Pelangi started its
promotional sales for certain items today.
	   Carrefour and UDA-Ocean still offered the best prices for
certain items such as toothpaste, soap and detergents.
	   Tops however offered a greater variety of products.

	   The last few weeks represent what in my mind is a historic
turning point for Indonesia and something of a coming of age for
this young nation. The leadership shown from such diverse people as
Gen. Wiranto and Dr. Amien Rais, and the fact that their voices of
moderation won the day is, I believe, a real triumph. It augurs
well for democracy and a political culture of openness, dialog and
compromise in the future.
	   As an Australian who has been resident here for around six
years, and one who remained in the country to sit out the crisis, I
feel privileged to have been around to witness that history.
	   The role of the media, and the courage of reporters and editors
of both print media and television also deserves praise. One
feature of the media here that I find interesting is the
willingness to afford artists --poets and musicians particularly --
a forum and a legitimate voice with which to comment on events.
	   W.S. Rendra's poem published in translation on Sunday, May 24 is
a good example. A feature of recent television coverage was also
the use of songs such as Himne Ibu Pertiwi (Hymn to the Mother
Land) for reflection and commentary.

	   MUAR, Sun. - Three fishermen taken captive by armed pirates
returned to the Parit Jawa fishing village last night after a
ransom of RM14,000 was paid for their release.
	   Lim Yong Koon, Hitam Salleh and Murad Bidon, all aged 30, were
kidnapped by armed pirates in Malaysian waters about l0 nautical
miles off Parit Bulat coast in Muar at 10am yesterday.
	   The fishermen, who arrived in their village at 10pm, said they
were given boiled banana, coffee and cigarettes while under
detention in a vessel anchored about three nautical miles off
Bantan Tengah at Pulau Bengkalis off Sumatra.
	   Recalling the incident today, Lim said four pirates aged between
30 and 40, one armed with a rifle, threatened to hit him when he
negotiated to lower the RM20,000 ransom originally demanded.
	   ``One of them aimed his rifle at my chest when I tried to reduce
the ransom to RM10,000.
	   ``They finally agreed to RM14,000 after listening to Hitam.''
	   Two fishermen, Mohd Fadil Mohd Yassin, 32, and Najib Ahmad, 34,
left the fishing village at 5pm yesterday with the RM14,000 ransom
money raised by the fishermen's community. Fadil said the ransom
money was handed over to a man believed to be the pirates' leader
at 7.30pm at an area about 27 nautical miles from the Parit Jawa
coast.

	   In the present atmosphere of reform, Indonesia's mass media have
been carrying advertisements about schedules of shareholders'
general meetings. It may not be far wrong to assume that these
advertisements are placed by companies belonging to family members
of former president Soeharto and also to business tycoons allegedly
enjoying facilities extended by officials in the old regime.
	   Why have these companies decided to hold these meetings so
suddenly? It must be linked to a stronger demand that the assets of
the family members of former president Soeharto and also those of
certain government officials and business tycoons be returned to
the state because it must be assumed that they all have acquired
these assets through corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   Will these meetings be held to transfer or sell the companies to
other parties or to remove traces of the original ownership to
certain other people? It must also be assumed that the old owners
will have fresh money which may be transferred abroad or to unknown
third parties. In this way they can sell these assets quickly, just
like what has happened to the assets of BHS Bank.
	   The government, therefore, must always be alert as otherwise it
will be taken caught off-guard. Thank God the Attorney General's
Office will probe the assets of these people.
	   So, supervision and monitoring must continue to be undertaken.
All assets assumed to have been acquired through corruption,
collusion and nepotism must be returned to the state and must not
be allowed to disappear into thin air.
	   Eddy Tansil is a case in point. Through practices of collusion,
corruption and nepotism, he has got away with Rp 1.3 trillion. He
is still at large although it is said that we have a specially
trained unit to deal with problems like this.

	   THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council will investigate the company
commissioned to construct low-cost units for the State Government
in Lembah Subang as work has been abandoned for more than two
months.
	   MPPJ senior councillor Khoo Ooi Seng said the developer
abandoned work even after the State Government had allocated 20ha
of land for social amenities.
	   ``The contractors have stopped work for more than two months. We
will hold discussions with them to identify the actual problem.
	   ``The State Government has made special allocations for low-cost
units. I do not see why the project has to be stopped,'' he said at
the council's monthly full board meeting.
	   Khoo said the project was aimed at solving housing woes among
squatters in the area.
	   The developer was scheduled to construct 2,872 low-cost units in
three 16- or 17-storey flats for 279 families from longhouses at
the former Taman Aman squatter area.
	   The Taman Aman squatter area has made way for the Light Rail
Transit Project.
	   Councillor Raja Ropiah Raja Abdullah said the abandoned project
was a serious matter as it would reflect badly on the council.
	   ``We cannot let the contractor get away by citing the economic
slowdown as a reason. There is a special allocation for low-cost
units.''
	   Raja Ropiah added that residents were not paying rent at the
moment and would only do so when the project has been completed.
	   ``We must have a meeting with the developer and identify the
actual problem. We have to solve it before the matter gets worse,''
she added.

Plans for school-level clubs to combat smoking, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Health Ministry will recommend the
setting up of Action on Smoking or Health (ASH) clubs in schools
nationwide, starting at secondary level, where students will act as
peer leaders to combat the rising trend of smoking among the youth.
	   The ASH clubs are aimed at creating a smoke-free environment
amongst schoolchildren through discussions, counselling sessions
and poster campaigns.
	   Speaking at the launch of the National Tobacco Free month in
conjunction with World Tobacco Free Day at the Central Market
today, Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said a
national survey by her Ministry in 1996 showed that 16.7 per cent
of teenagers below 18 smoked.
	   This was an increase compared to the 1986 figure of 10 per cent.
	   The survey also showed that there was a greater tendency for
boys to take up smoking at a rate of 30.7 per cent compared to 4.8
per cent among girls.
	   She said it was imperative to educate teenagers about the
dangers of smoking whilst still in school so that they can make
responsible choices when they leave school.
	   ``Having these clubs in the schools is a good idea as it will
create a counter group among the peers to do away with the notion
that smoking is the ``in'' thing,'' she said.
	   She said the matter would be raised with the Education Minister
soon and its implementation was likely within this year. The clubs
will be formed with the help of the Public Health Committee of the
Malaysian Medical Association.
	   Committee chairman Dr Lekhraj Rampal said in his speech that
they would begin the clubs in secondary schools before introducing
them to primary schools.
	   ``We are willing to provide the technical assistance to the
education ministry such as giving talks, showing slides and
providing the peer leaders with the right information and education
on the harmful effects of tobacco,'' he said. Among the activities
for National Tobacco Free Month are a poster competition and ``Quit
Smoking For a Month'' campaign.

	   During Jakarta's time of crisis, I had to visit Singapore. I
purchased a Kodak DC25 Digital Camera to be able to take digital
photographs instead of relying on currently high priced film
developing. Due to fires and ransacking of buildings, the camera
was unobtainable in Jakarta.
	   Unfortunately, the camera broke down due to a minor fault.
Personal calls to both local Kodak agents, PT Inter-Delta and PT
Machindo, were unfruitful because the camera had been purchased in
Singapore.
	   A fax was sent to Kodak Singapore. Within an hour, Mr. Jeffrey
Ho, the Singapore manager, was on the phone to me. Within 24 hours,
I had a replacement camera.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks plunged more than 10 percent Monday
in a frenzy of selling by Russian banks and a cold shoulder from
foreign investors wary of the market's turmoil.
	   The Russian Trading System index closed 10.2 percent lower after
late panic selling gripped the market and reassuring comments from
government officials failed to calm jittery investors.
	   Monday's close matched the 10-percent fall last Wednesday, when
hectic selling caused the stock market to plummet and threatened a
run on the national currency, the ruble.
	   The market has fallen 44 percent since the beginning of May,
making it the worst performing market in the world. There are fears
that an international bailout will be needed, but that it won't
come soon enough to prevent more big losses.
	   ``I think that the Americans have woken up to the seriousness of
this, but they are being cagey about when something will come and
how much,'' said Charles Blitzer, an economist for Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette, an investment bank.
	   ``I think that the cavalry is to the rescue, but there is a
question about whether it is too little, too late,'' Blitzer said.
	   The Central Bank has intervened to prop up the ruble and tripled
a key interest rate to 150 percent to persuade investors to stay in
Russia. A top bank official insisted Monday the bank will remain
firm in its policy to defend the ruble. Devaluation could lead to
steep price hikes and social unrest.
	   ``We will do our best to escape that kind of scenario,'' said
Alexander Potyomkin, the bank's first deputy chairman, referring to
the possibility of devaluation.
	   Boris Fyodorov, Russia's new tax chief, said Monday that
government has enough cash reserves to protect the ruble, which
closed relatively unchanged at 6.18 to the dollar.
	   But with those reserves thought now to be less than dlrs 10
billion, traders said the central bank cannot support markets much
longer without help from the International Monetary Fund or someone
else.
	   Fyodorov acknowledged an additional dlrs 5 billion from the IMF
would help stabilize the market.
	   Russian leaders have said that the economic crisis was triggered
by a combination of forces, including a sharp fall in world prices
for gas and oil, the financial crisis in southeast Asia, and social
unrest including a recent wave of coal miners' strikes.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Monday that
economic growth predicted for this year probably would not
materialize, but was optimistic that the country could cope with
the current crisis.
	   ``If the government is able to quickly and effectively eliminate
the consequences of the past week, the stability of the real sector
of the economy will be preserved,'' he told a news conference.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian Chinese, as they are referred to,
are an important element among Indonesia's middle and upper class
capitalists, entrepreneurs, business people, traders, professionals
and skilled people.
	   It should not be forgotten that although there are also poor
Chinese, seven or eight of the top 10 capitalists in Indonesia are
of Chinese origin. On the list of the 200 richest people in the
country over 50 percent are Chinese.
	   Indicative of this predominance in the economy is the
proliferation of Chinese-owned shops along the main streets of all
Indonesian towns and cities. The retail trade is an important
aspect of the livelihood made by the Chinese community in
Indonesia.
	   The Chinese are not a homogeneous group and are almost as
diverse as the archipelago itself. The Chinese in Java came as
individuals or in small groups and arrived here even before people
from the West. The migrants largely became integrated into the
local population so that now Javanese-Chinese in the main do not
speak any of the Chinese languages.
	   In West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo and on the East-coast
of Sumatra, the Chinese migrated as whole communities to work on
plantations and in mines. The Chinese in these regions have
retained their own languages. In Northern Sulawesi (Celebes) and
the Moluccas they have become assimilated into local society.
	   In addition to these different circumstances, the Chinese
practice a variety of religions, including denominations of the
Christian faith, Buddhism and Taoism.
	   The origins of the Chinese minority dates, like so many other
things in modern Indonesia, from the days of the Dutch colonial
regime. Both the Dutch and the Chinese were trading peoples and
came to the archipelago for that purpose.
	   The Chinese were the trading partners of the Dutch, right from
the early days of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), and they
never lost this intermediary position. This did not mean that
relations were always smooth. In fact, the first massacre of
Chinese occurred in Batavia in 1740 and was perpetrated by members
of the Dutch population in the city.
	   After this event, the Dutch enforced an official racial
segregation policy. The Chinese had to live in their own quarters,
which were found in all towns, and a permit was required to travel
between Chinese areas in different cities. This ghetto system
restricting Chinese physical mobility was not abolished until 1905.
	   The Dutch East Indies split the population of the archipelago
into three groups for administrative purposes -- Europeans, Foreign
Orientals, and Natives. The system was an embryonic form of what
later became known in South Africa as apartheid, and which now has
pariah status among the world's political ideologies. It is
therefore a fallacy that Dutch favoritism helped the Chinese into
their powerful economic position.
	   Strong anti-Chinese sentiment existed among Dutch colonial
officials and was particularly evident under the Ethical Policy
(1900) which was introduced to promote the interests of the
indigenous population. Dutch colonial officials felt they had to
protect the native population against the shrewd Chinese.
	   However, this and other discriminatory practices did not mean
that the Chinese did not flourish under the colonial system.
	   Wealth has traditionally been made through governments in the
Indonesian archipelago. In the nineteenth century, the Chinese were
granted the privilege to grow and trade in opium and to run pawn
shops in exchange for lucrative tax payments which they had to make
to the government. This did not endear them to the native
population. Farms were usually owned by semi-hereditary headmen.
The owners were also usually the main traders because their favored
status with the government meant that they and their agents were
exempt from the travel restrictions imposed on other members of the
Chinese community. This system promoted the development of Chinese
capitalism.
	   The Chinese, as Dutch trading partners, were subjected to Dutch
property and business laws. From the early 20th century they were
also subjected to Dutch family law. These laws gave the Chinese a
degree of security on their commercial holdings which could not be
obtained under the arbitrary adat (traditional) law which was laid
down upon them by the high and mighty Indonesians of the day.
	   Protection afforded by Western law and their position as traders
placed the Chinese beyond the reach of the vitriolic sentiment of
Dutch official, which was said to be worse than the anti-Chinese
sentiment held by the other colonial powers of the day, including
Britain and France.
	   It is often said that newly independent countries reflect their
recent colonial past, which may go some way toward explaining the
anti-Chinese sentiment held by Indonesian officials today.
	   Colonial anti-Chinese polices gave rise to the so called Chinese
movement in Java, which aimed to emancipate the Chinese community
by demanding that restrictions on the movement of members of their
community be abolished, full equality before the law, and the
establishment of Chinese schools.
	   The movement was the first emancipation movement which the Dutch
faced from their colonial subjects. The movement was not
anti-colonial in nature. It only sought rights for the Chinese
people of the Indies and did not speak for natives or other ethnic
groups. Political and social movements tended to retain the
segregated character of the colonial society which spawned them and
speak only for a single ethnic group.
	   Around 1900, most of the Chinese demands were met and
Dutch-Chinese Schools (HCS) were launched by the colonial
government, even before the Dutch Schools for Natives (HIS) came
into existence.
	   When the government lifted the ban restricting Chinese mobility
in 1905, Chinese business people moved out of the ghettos and came
increasingly into competition with the Javanese entrepreneurial
classes.
	   The Sarekat Dagang Islam (Association of Moslem Traders), which
later became the Sarekat Islam (1909), formed in response to this
development, and went on to become the first mass social and
political movement in the Indies.
	   The first anti-Chinese riot occurred in 1918 in the town of
Kudus, which had a strong Javanese and Moslem bourgeoisie. The
catalyst was a Chinese temple procession which offended the Moslem
population, however the incident occurred against a backdrop of
middle class rivalries.
	   All other Indonesian political movements were equally exclusive
and admitted Indonesians only. Even the PNI (Nationalist Party)
formed by Sukarno in 1926 admitted Chinese only as observers. The
exception to this exclusivity was the Indies Association of Tjipto
Mangoenkoesoemo, Douwes Dekker and Ki Hajar Dewantara which
accepted Chinese and other ethnic groups as members.
	   In response to being largely excluded from the jostling for
political power, Chinese professionals who advocated an independent
Indonesia formed the Partai Tionghoa Indonesia (Indonesian-Chinese
party) in 1930.
	   In the late 1930s, the left wing PARTINDO lead by Amir
Syarifudin decided to accept Chinese members, whereas the more
rightist PARINDRA would not.
	   That was the situation when the Japanese invaded in 1942. Only
after the invasion did mass anti-Chinese violence explode for the
first time. The worst hit areas were on the north coast of Java and
the targets were mainly the homes and shops of wealthy Chinese.
	   Indonesia's history since the war has been violent in comparison
to its immediate neighbors Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
	   However during the revolution against the Dutch, not all
violence was directed toward the Chinese. Eurasians, Moluccans and
the traditional elite were also targeted. The only notable
anti-Chinese incident during the revolution occurred in Tangerang,
near Jakarta.
	   The 1950s saw the introduction of policies which discriminated
against the Chinese, including the ``Benteng'' policy which
attempted to encourage the rise of an Indonesian business class,
and later bans on foreign Chinese trade and settlement in rural
areas.
	   During the early 1960s, the country's economy deteriorated and
the Chinese became a pawn in Cold War politics. Several serious
urban riots which targeted the Chinese occurred during the
unsettled period of 1965/1966, although most violence was directed
against suspected communists.
	   Punch and counterpunch of pro- and anti-communist forces lead to
serious unrest in Indonesia, which many experts abroad mistakenly
interpreted as a massacre of the Chinese. This misunderstanding may
have arisen as a result of the introduction of a ban on many
aspects of Chinese life and culture which the government introduced
around the same time. Among aspects of Chinese culture declared
illegal were plays (but not films), public festivities and Chinese
characters. A drive to encourage Chinese to adopt local names was
also launched to coincide with this suppression of Chinese culture.
	   Under the New Order government, tensions between the Chinese and
native communities grew as a result of the widening gap between
rich and poor in the country, and the low pay given to the state
bureaucracy, military and police. Furthermore, while the native
population turned ever more toward Islam, the Chinese sought
spiritual comfort through the Christian faith.
	   Violent incidents during the New Order government have been
racial and religious in nature. Violence can destabilize any
government and is revolutionary in nature. It is a criminal act,
regardless of whom it is directed against or who is using it to
advantage.
	   Violence is no solution to the tensions that exist in society.
The only way to achieve harmony is to change one's perceptions of
society and view it as a multi-ethnic, multi-racial and
multi-cultural entity. The Indonesian nation is political concept,
and to ensure future stability different ethnic groups must be
treated in the same way and meet as equals under the same legal
protection.
	   Recent anti-Chinese riots in Jakarta happened as a result of
jealousy and racist sentiment. The Chinese community has shown
creativity and achieved economic success, despite their unpopular
position in society. The feudal elite, as obsessed by power and
status as the Chinese are by money, felt threatened by this success
and became jealous.
	   Today, private enterprise is at a standstill, many buildings
stand in ruins and government and military authority are fast
waning.
	   Paku Buwono (Nail of the Universe) is the traditional title
given to the Javanese monarchy. If the Nail is removed the Universe
will collapse. History in Indonesia is cyclical, but nobody seems
to learn from it.
	   The writer is a historian.
	   Window : As a result of the colonial anti-Chinese polices there
arose the so called Chinese movement in Java aiming at emancipating
the Chinese by demanding the abolition of the physical restrictions
on Chinese, equality before the law, establishment of Chinese
schools and others.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Health Ministry will come up with
proposals for the Cabinet on alternative measures of funding for
sectors, particularly sports and entertainment, which are largely
dependent on revenue from tobacco companies.
	   Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said today
the proposals will be submitted to the Cabinet in June, after the
ministry's officials have had a dialogue on the issue with
professional bodies, non-governmental organisations and other
concerned parties.
	   Siti Zaharah said this at a Press Conference after the launch of
the Tobacco Free Month in conjunction with World Tobacco Free Day
at the Central Market.
	   She said the Government had been unable to ban indirect tobacco
advertising due to the large revenue brought in by these companies.
	   One of the measures being considered by the ministry is linked
to the taxation on tobacco companies.
	   ``We feel that there is a need to be affirmative on this issue
as a concerted effort must be made to have a smoke-free
environment.''
	   However, Siti Zaharah declined to elaborate on the proposals
being considered.
	   A recent report in the New Straits Times said that tobacco
companies here spend about RM400 million in advertising annually.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Kuala Lumpur Hospital authorities today
recorded a statement from Chandra Bos Kanniah, 52, in connection
with the disappearance of the body of his still-born son from the
mortuary last week.
	   Police have also recorded a statement from him.
	   The hospital has begun its own probe.
	   Yesterday, hospital deputy director Dr Ramlee Rahmat said action
would be taken against employees found to be involved in the
disappearance.
	   Last Saturday, Chandra Bos had lodged two police reports
claiming the body of his still-born child had ``mysteriously
disappeared'' from the mortuary.
	   His wife, Ambujam Balakrishnan, 45, had delivered the baby last
Friday.
	   However, he was informed later that the baby was still-born and
told to return to the hospital to claim the body. A medical officer
had given him the baby's death certificate which stated the cause
of death as mecerated still birth/intra utrine death.
	   The next day, when Chandra Bos came to the mortuary he was told
someone had claimed it. He also claimed that two workers at the
mortuary had offered him compensation of RM1000 and RM2000 each, to
keep the matter under wraps.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Malaysian Trades Union Congress feels
that a National Labour Advisory Council meeting will be the best
forum to settle once and for all allegations that MTUC
secretary-general G. Rajasekaran had been spreading lies about the
country abroad.
	   However, MTUC president Zainal Rampak said he was under the
impression that the issue had already been settled in a similar
meeting in August, 1996, but ``appeared to have resurfaced after
two years''.
	   ``MTUC has agreed that to maintain harmony, another NLAC meeting
should be convened to settle the matter,'' he said in a statement.
	   On Thursday, Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek made
public a video tape as proof that Rajasekaran had been spreading
lies about the country in a forum in Washington DC in the United
States two years ago.
	   Lim said Rajasekaran had been unable to substantiate his claims,
among which were that there were in Malaysia, enterprise-based or
so-called company-based unions which were created by the employers.
	   In addition to refuting these claims, Lim said, Rajasekaran had
failed to provide the names of the companies for investigation.
	   To this, Zainal said the names of the companies had been
submitted to the Ministry but if required, it would be sent again.
	   Zainal said MTUC was more concerned in helping the country
overcome its economic woes and hoped to work together with the
Government on this.
	   In light of this, he said MTUC would put forward proposals on
how best to safeguard the interests of workers and suggest the
implementation of an employees service scheme.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Soeharto's resignation from his previously
invincible presidency was a momentous turning point in Indonesian
history. B.J. Habibie, formerly Vice President, acceded to the
office, leading what is necessarily, by the supreme command of the
people of Indonesia, a transitional government. The inevitable
demise of the seemingly perennial ruler stunned the populace into a
contemplative combination of joy and pondering.
	   Yet such contemplative moments must cease very soon, considering
the political and economic abyss which the New Order government
left behind. The inception of the transitional government, whose
aim is to conduct a fair and democratic general election, is the
order of the day. A new set of people's representatives is an
indispensable basic on which a ``liberated'' Indonesia is to be
founded.
	   Inasmuch as we have chosen the constitutional path to
reformation, we are faced with the dilemma of having to trust again
political figures who prima facie are unworthy of such trust.
	   It was only a few weeks ago that Habibie, as vice president, in
response to the blatant majority support for an extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), blurted: ``We
have only been in office for two months. We now have those who
demand an extraordinary session (of the MPR). Those who do so are
making an affront to democracy and an insult to the people.''
	   In so doing, we are perfectly aware of the necessity to rewrite
our political bills dealing with the ballot, political parties and
the composition of the MPR and the House of Representatives (DPR).
Nonetheless, it is of equal paramount importance that a press act
be drafted in conjunction with the political bills, safeguarding
and affirming, as the first Amendment of the American Constitution
states, ``the awesome freedom and awesome responsibility'' of the
press.
	   A liberated press could act as an ``agent controleur'' for the
transitional government during the process of rewriting the
political bills, and the press is the ideal forum through which
administrative transparency could be attained. The press, in the
long run, would be beneficial for nurturing critical and civil
libertarian public mentality, eradicating the intimidated wong
cilik (inferior man) mentality for good.
	   Another advantage of free press is the anticipated
implementation of a ``district ballot system'', which will
personalize polities as the candidates become more important than
the political parties they represent. The implementation of the
district ballot system in the absence of free press would be
ludicrous.
	   To confound and thwart any attempt at manifesting certain
groups' or individuals' vested interests in the reform process,
another mechanism of checks and balance is duly unexpendable. A
question has been posed by political analysts as how to contain the
previously ignored voices outside the system.
	   The likes of Amien Rais, Megawati Soekarnoputri, Nurcholish
Madjid, Loeby Luqman, Emil Salim, Sri Mulyani and even Sri Bintang
Pamungkas, who were effectively hindered from entering the system,
are now an integral part of our thorough reform. These voices are
too invaluable to be kept inaudible.
	   These figures were in accordance with Soeharto's reform council
deal, originally to be assigned to the said council. However, the
aftermath of the resignation has rendered the deal annulled.
Arguably, the ``Soehartoesque'' council really has no
constitutional precedent and is of dubious legitimacy. Therefore,
through what mechanism can these figures participate in the reform?
	   If we are to refer back to the 1945 Constitution, there is a
state institution which the New Order has transformed into an old
people's home for retired government officials, ministers and
generals, namely the Supreme Advisory Council.
	   While the definitive role of the council is somewhat vague
according to the constitution, its job description, in Article 16,
includes being ``endowed with the duty to present answers to the
President's questions and being entitled to give advice to the
government.''
	   Consequently, it is within constitutional boundaries to return
the council to its rightful place which the New Order's selective
negligence has overlooked. Having done so, the transitional
government could install the so-called ``critical'' figures into
the council with the assent of the DPR. It is worth noting that the
DPR must necessarily be omniscient and omniacquiescent so far as
the executive's conduct is concerned during the course of the
reform.
	   Moreover, university students, as the instigators of reform, are
to be granted the prerogative to oversee and have a say in the
reform process. A number of university students' representatives
could be allowed into legislative sessions acting as observers and
active participants in legislative deliberation. These students'
representatives could even be installed as members of the MPR if
needed.
	   Constitutionally speaking, the move is not wholly
unconstitutional, as Article 2 allows representatives of groups in
the populace to be included. The presence of students'
representatives is no more constitutional than the unelected Armed
Forces (ABRI) representatives, which have no constitutional
legitimacy to sit in the legislature whatsoever. In fact, the large
presence of ABRI in the MPR is not conducive to democracy and ought
to be restricted or totally eliminated under the new bill governing
the composition of the MPR.
	   In order to ensure effective and rapid progress of the reform,
the DPR would be necessitated to issue definite working deadlines
for the government. This is crucial in warding off any vested
interests to retard the reform to any particular group's or
individual's advantage.
	   Having secured the initial step to reform in the presidential
resignation, the Indonesian people could hope to look forward to a
better future. The present young generation has been given the
privilege to decisively remold the kind of Indonesia we want to
live in. It is a historic privilege for which the world would be
watching us. Liberte, Equalite, Fraternite, Vive la democratie.
	   The writer works at the International Language Program,
Surabaya.
	   Window: Inasmuch as we have chosen the constitutional path to
reformation, we are faced with the dilemma of having to trust again
political figures who prima facie are unworthy of such trust.

	   REFLECTING its seriousness in answering the Government's call to
``garden the nation'' by 2005, the Shah Alam Municipal Council
yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Agricultural
Chemicals (M) Sdn Bhd to transform the town into an
internationally-recognised landscaped garden city.
	   Council president Mohamad Adzib Mohd Isa said the ACM would be
providing technical know-how on plant cultivation and maintenance,
including fertilisers and pesticides, to the council's landscape
contractors.
	   ``This is to help the council's contractors learn techniques in
planting and maintaining plants so that the trees and plants will
be healthier and bear more flowers,'' he said.
	   The MoU was signed by Mohamad Adzib and ACM managing director
Hsu I-Che and witnessed by National Landscape Department
director-general Datuk Ismail Ngah.
	   Speaking to reporters after the signing, Mohamad Adzib said the
co-operation with ACM had no time limit.
	   He said that ACM had been chosen as consultants based on its
excellent track record in agricultural research and development and
official recognition by the Government.
	   Among awards won by the company were the Malaysia Industry
Excellence Award and the Merdeka Award for Corporate Excellence -
the 24th placing among top companies in Malaysia with the highest
RD expenditure in Science and Technology.
	   Mohamad Adzib said not all 28 landscape contractors with the
council would be trained by ACM.
	   ``We will choose only certain areas, with the town centre being
the first,'' he said.
	   Earlier in his speech, Mohamad Adzib said the council had so far
spent RM9 million on landscaping and RM3 million on maintenance
work.
	   The council had also obtained RM3 million from the National
Landscape Department for landscaping in view of the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Meanwhile, Hsu said the council would be paying a small amount
for consultation services.
	   ``The cost will be very cheap as this is for mutual benefit,''
he said, adding that the co-operation would be a win-win situation
for both entities.
	   ``This co-operation will be able to support our research and
development activities and more people can enjoy our technique and
approach,'' he said.
	   He added that research carried out by the company catered to the
Malaysian conditions.
	   He said the company would establish a standard operating
procedure for each of the council's contractors to monitor their
progress.
	   Hsu said the company was also negotiating with other local
authorities on the possibility of extending its services.
	   Meanwhile, Ismail said his department would provide technical
expertise to local authorities on landscaping work in preparation
for the Commonwealth Games.

Junta accuses U.S., South Africa, Ghana of anti-Abacha plot 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Gen. Sani Abacha's ruling military junta
on Monday accused the United States, South Africa and the West
African country of Ghana of plotting to disrupt upcoming
presidential elections.
	   Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, Abacha in
April became the only candidate for August presidential elections,
rendering the poll into little more than a referendum on his
selection.
	   His supporters, however, say Washington is teaming up with
leaders from South Africa, Ghana and exiled Nigerian opposition
activists to block Abacha's president.
	   Abacha seized power in a bloodless 1993 coup and while he has
repeatedly pledged to hand over power to a civilian government, it
now seems that Abacha plans to keep the job for himself.
	   In a six-page statement issued during a press conference Monday,
the military junta said officials from the United States and South
Africa recently met in nearby Ghana to discuss coordinated
opposition to the August elections.
	   ``The issues discussed at the meeting were the strategies to be
adopted by pro-democracy and human rights groups in Nigeria to
ensure the termination of the present government,'' the statement
said.
	   The junta also said U.S.-backed pro-democracy groups were
working to restore the canceled 1993 election result, in which
opposition leader Moshood Abiola apparently won the presidency.
	   Abiola's presumed electoral victory was quashed when Abacha
stopped the vote counting and declared the poll invalid. Abiola was
later jailed and charged with treason for declaring himself
president.
	   Abacha's military supporters have repeatedly accused the United
States of funding opposition activities and say officials from
Washington discussed the use of mass protest rallies and boycotts
to block the upcoming elections.

	   MALACCA, Sun. - Solving social problems plaguing children is as
important as overcoming the nation's economic situation, National
Unity and Social Development Minister Datin Paduka Zaleha Ismail
said last night.
	   She said if parents do not attend to the problems of their
children now, then social problems like HIV/AIDS, drugs, loafing,
pre-marital sex and abandoned babies may see a sharp increase.
	   ``This was proven when my Ministry did a survey two years back
which showed that the number of social problems in this country for
the past five years had seen a dramatic rise.
	   ``Therefore, handling the current economic situation is one
thing but families must also place emphasis on taking care and
solving the problem of their children so that they are not involved
in negative activities,''she said.
	   Zaleha said this in her keynote address at the launching of a
conference entitled `Role of the Family in the Next Millennium'
organised by the Women's Federation for World Peace at the Pan
Pacific Legacy hotel last night.
	   Also present were WFWP patron, Datuk Paduka Dr Saleha Mohd Ali;
Datin Seri Khalijah Mohd Jiddi, wife of Chief Minister Datuk Seri
Abu Zahar Isnin and organising committee chairman, Kian Sit Har.
	   Zaleha said that besides providing care, parents should also
instil a high-level of discipline and noble values in their
children.
	   She said another survey by the National Population and Family
Planning Board recently showed that a working parent only had 10
minutes a week to interact with his or her children.
	   She said working parents should find time for their children
instead of concentrating on material gains alone.
	   She urged non-governmental organisations to to assist the
Government in reducing social problems.

	   THE New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd reported a group pre-tax
profit of RM59 million for the half-year ended Feb 28, down 43 per
cent from RM104.31 million in the previous corresponding period.
	   Turnover dipped six per cent to RM369.76 million from RM394.18
million.
	   At company level, pre-tax profit fell 23 per cent to RM50.17
million from RM65.08 million while turnover dropped 10 per cent to
RM240.94 million from RM268.7 million.
	   The Group said the economic slowdown had affected business and
attributed the lower turnover to cutbacks in advertising
expenditure.
	   Also, the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar had
resulted in higher newsprint costs.
	   The lower pre-tax profit was also a result of a substantial
reduction in contributions from associate companies.
	   The directors expect the current half-year results to be
comparable with that of the first half.
	   The group's paid-up share capital as of yesterday was RM198.33
million while earnings per share for the half-year stood at 22 sen.

	   SEREMBAN, Sun. - A day-old baby girl, wrapped in a piece of
white cloth, was found abandoned under a mango tree at the Seremban
Hospital car park about 9.30pm on Friday.

Huat, the infant, with its umbilical cord still intact, was found
by hospital staff who were alerted by the baby's cries.
	   He said that the 2.65kg baby of fair complexion was reported to
be in a satisfactory condition.
	   He added that she would be kept under observation for two to
three days.
	   ``Once the doctors are satisfied with her health, she will be
handed over to the State Welfare Department. The baby will then be
placed at the Rumah Sinar Harapan in Temiang,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Seremban district police chief, Assistant
Commissioner Mak Chee Onn said police were carrying out
investigation and trying to locate the infant's parents.

	   Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah has promised to return
what the Soeharto regime stole from the national press: its
freedom. The statement, which is in line with the promised
political reform, brings with it a new horizon for the national
press after decades of structural darkness. While the government
still has to elaborate on the new policy, we sincerely hope it
means the revocation of all laws and regulations which curtail all
basic freedoms, and at the same time offers no loopholes to the
authorities to repeat the shameful history of press bans. In the
past, even the Indonesian Journalist Association pushed the press
into a corner. Since press freedom is inseparable from other
freedoms, such as freedom of expression; of association; from fear;
and freedom to dissent, the government should also guarantee the
freedom of the legislative and judicial branches from
administration influence. This nation suffered beyond words during
the oppressive regime of president Soeharto, which only tolerated a
``don't-touch-the-regime'' type of journalism during the last 24
years of his 32-year rule. So when freedom does eventually return,
we would be unsurprised to see the national press befogged by the
new situation, just like a person coming out of a dark cave to be
blinded by the bright sun. Even today, with a touch of freedom
felt, editors still look stunned at unchecked outspokenness, as if
the sword of Democles hangs over their heads. The picture is more
than understandable because they have lived under the threat of
press bans for too long, ever since a newspaper was tyrannically
banned in 1974, after a brief honeymoon with democracy. The
experience turns even more painful when one remembers how editors
in 1978 were forced to sign a pledge stating that they would never
criticize the first family. This was in order to have their revoked
publishing licenses reinstated. The muzzling of the press was then
used to the advantage of the ruling elite, in that it felt free to
practice nepotism, cronyism and corruption. It is now a national
responsibility to avoid a reoccurrence of such a calamity by
helping to advocate democracy. The press has to play a pivotal role
in this because it is a common phenomenon in undemocratic countries
that governments are still confused as where to place the mass
media in the system. Here the authorities need not worry about
press freedom because the existing Criminal Code is enough to
protect all parties who find themselves discredited by media
reports. On the other hand, the press should make itself a credible
institution, avoid sensationalizing news and sticking to its Code
of Ethics. As an institution operating in a developing country, it
should also help educate people by speaking the truth and refusing
half truths from officials. To boost the press' social
responsibility, society has also a role to play. It should set up
an independent and active body to supervise the quality of the
press. After years of nightmarish experiences, we believe the
national press has matured and will be able to perform its
constitutional right with integrity.

Britain urges Pakistan and India to sign nuclear arms treaty and open negotiations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Monday called on Pakistan and India to
sign up to nuclear arms control conventions and discuss the roots
of tension between the two countries to avoid a nuclear arms race
in southern Asia.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons that
Pakistan had acted in ``flagrant disregard of international
opinion,'' by carrying out two sets of nuclear tests last week. The
Pakistani tests came two weeks after India carried out five nuclear
tests, heightening tension between the two nations.
	   ``The international community is united in its insistence that
Pakistan should refrain from further tests,'' Cook said in his
first statement in Parliament since Pakistan tested its nuclear
devices.
	   Cook called on both nations to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and to halt the production of nuclear material, and said
``the need is now more urgent that ever'' for the states to open
negotiations to reduce tensions.
	   Pakistan and India are at loggerheads over the disputed region
of Kashmir, and have fought two wars in 1948 and 1965 over the
control of the Himalayan territory. Both nations won independence
from Britain in 1947.
	   Britain has canceled visits by senior Pakistani and Indian
military officials and will review trading links with both
countries, Cook said. However, the government will not halt aid
programs.
	   ``Britain's aid program,'' Cook said, '' is directly targeted on
providing help to the poorest people in the poorest regions. We
remain convinced that it would be wrong to penalize the most
vulnerable citizens in either country.''
	   Cook said that a meeting in London on June 12 of the G8, the
group of leading industrial nations that includes the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Russia
would send a powerful signal to both south Asian nations.
	   ``The meeting will coordinate our approach to Pakistan and India
in the light of nuclear tests,'' Cook said.

	   KAJANG, Fri. - The growing number of power failures reported in
the Klang Valley over the past few weeks will not turn into a
crisis as is the case with water supply, Tenaga Nasional Bhd
executive chairman Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali said tonight.
	   He said unlike the water crisis which was caused by inadequate
supply due to the lack of rain, power failures were caused by more
manageable problems, such as a sudden increase of outage and damage
to power cables.
	   ``These problems can be more easily remedied as we can promptly
analyse the situation and take prompt action.''
	   He said Tenaga Nasional was upgrading electrical cables which
had inadequate capacity and identified as the major cause of the
recent breakdowns.
	   ``For the past one month, TNB had spent over RM7 million to
replace these cables and taken other measures such as improving
power distribution units in certain areas in Kuala Lumpur and
Petaling Jaya.''
	   Ahmad Tajuddin was speaking to reporters after attending a
welcoming ceremony for 1,875 students of the Universiti Tenaga
Nasional who completed their orientation programme today.
	   He assured the public that the recent power failures were
confined to specific areas where the pace of development had
exceeded TNB's infrastructure, such as low voltage cable that had
been laid earlier.
	   Speaking earlier to the students, Ahmad Tajuddin called on them
to use the opportunity of their admission into Uniten to strive to
become capable professionals.

	   PENANG, Fri. - The Fisheries Department has been urged to step
up its enforcement to stamp out the use of pukat siput in the
inshore areas of Perlis.
	   Sahabat Alam Malaysia said the pukat siput menace had been going
on for too long and was threatening the livelihood of more than
1,000 fishermen.
	   SAM president S.M. Mohd Idris urged the department to step up
its patrols and beef up enforcement against unscrupulous trawler
boats using the pukat siput.
	   ``Stiffer penalties should be meted out to those caught using
this kind of nets which have been outlawed,'' he said.
	   Mohd Idris said the department should also determine why these
illegal activities were being carried on despite action against
some violators.

	   KUCHING, Fri. - More schools with creative and innovative
designs are expected to be built in future because the current
standard designs are hardly inspiring.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said under the
``design-and-build concept'' the developers did not have to follow
any standard design.
	   Working committees, both at the federal and state levels, had
been formed to identify schools for such projects.
	   ``Under the design-and-build concept, there is no need to follow
any standard design, but the problem is the cost may be high.
	   ``This is different in the case of standard design as we can
control the price,'' he told reporters after opening Sekolah Rendah
Kerajaan Satria Jaya at Taman BDC near here today.
	   Among those present at the function were State Agriculture and
Food Industries Minister Datuk Adenan Satem, Assistant Industrial
Development Minister Sim Kheng Hui and state education director
Putit Matzen.
	   Najib commended Borneo Development Corporation (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd
for not only building a ``beautiful and cute'' school but also
donating the RM3.98 million structure to the Government.
	   SRK Satria Jaya, which sits on a 1.01 hectare plot of land and
started operation on Dec 4, 1995, has 24 classrooms, 289 pupils and
19 teachers.
	   Najib also said he was proud that the standard of education in
Sarawak was high, with students performing better than the national
average.
	   On the shortage of graduate teachers in the State, he said more
would be sent.
	   ``But whatever difficulties we may face, let us never give up
hope but continue to struggle for the good of the future
generations,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia will
consider appeals by students whose applications to pursue first
degree or matriculation programmes have been rejected.
	   UKM will, however, only consider appeals for degree programmes
in basic science and social sciences and matriculation programmes
in science and mathematics.
	   Vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dr Anuwar Ali said the
university would accept 250 applicants for degree studies in
mathematical, life, social, as well as applied and physical
sciences.
	   ``Places for other programmes like medicine, pharmacy,
information technology, engineering, accounting and economics have
been filled up,'' he told reporters after launching the ``Home Care
Nursing'' programme at Hospital UKM in Cheras today.
	   About 200 nurses participated in the programme held in
conjunction with World Nursing Day.
	   It was organised for Cheras residents by the hospital and UKM's
faculty of medicine.
	   Anuwar said the applications depended on the places available
and the students' qualifications.
	   Yesterday, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had
said that the Unit Pusat Universiti Infoline system was reviewing
1,000 appeals by students who had obtained an aggregate of 15 and
below.
	   Anuwar said there were 100 to 200 places under the university's
franchise programme for matriculation science and mathematics at
private institutions.
	   Places for law and accounting/economic matriculation programmes
have been filled up.
	   At present, UKM has an enrolment of 2,226 students for
matriculation programmes, 19,036 for first degree and 8,000 for
distance learning.
	   Asked about the reported ragging of a first-year student, Anuwar
said deputy vice-chancellor (student affairs department) Professor
Datuk Dr Wan Hashim Wan Teh had met with the girl's parents this
morning.
	   He said the department would investigate the case and take
disciplinary action, including suspension, against those
responsible.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The student who dropped out of Universiti
Putra Malaysia, claiming to be a victim of ragging, has still not
filed a report and this is hampering investigations.
	   UPM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Syed Jalaluddin Syed Salim
said there was no response to numerous telephone calls to his home.
	   However, university authorities are questioning his room mate,
friends and the hostel master, in an attempt to discover the
identities of the five youths behind the alleged incident.
	   It was reported last week that UPM freshie R. Prasath, 20, from
Ipoh was allegedly assaulted by five youths, believed to be
seniors, in his hostel.
	   Syed Jalaluddin also said UPM expected to submit its report to
the Education Ministry in a week, along with another report on a
student who attempted suicide a few days later after struggling to
cope with campus life.
	   He however said the attempted suicide was not caused by ragging.
	   ``The student is recovering. We hope parents will let us know if
their children find it difficult to cope so that the students can
then be given counselling and assistance,'' he said.
	   He said this after signing a memorandum of understanding with
the Commonwealth Secretariat to launch a diploma programme on youth
in development work.
	   Commonwealth secretary-general Chief Emeka Anyaoku signed for
the secretariat, witnessed by deputy secretary-general Sir Humphrey
Maud and Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
	   Syed Jalaluddin said the university had the power to take
disciplinary action, including expulsion, against the five youths.
	   He also said incidents of ragging had declined over the years
and are now uncommon. Ragging is not permitted.
	   On the 18-month diploma programme, he said it aimed to equip
people with skills for youth work. The first intake of 50 will be
in November. The diploma is equivalent to completing the first year
of a related degree course.
	   Anyaoku said Malaysia is the first to launch a youth diploma
programme with the Commonwealth and will be followed by another 15
universities in member countries, including India and South Africa.
	   The programme content was drawn up with input from 10 countries.
``It's a demonstration of the Commonwealth at work in a global
fashion,'' he said.

Yemen's new government vows to carry on economic reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen's new prime minister on Monday
unveiled his government's policies, pledging to continue with the
three-year-old economic and administrative reforms.
	   But Prime Minister Abdel-Karim al-Iryani cautioned that the
Asian economic crisis and the fall in oil prices will have a
negative effect on the economy and further increase the budget
deficit to 36.2 billion rials (dlrs 275 million).
	   ``The government will continue the process of economic,
financial and monetary reforms and launch a broad national
administrative reform program,'' al-Iryani told Parliament where he
presented his policy statement.
	   The oil revenues, which represent about 40 percent of the
country's total income, are Yemen's main source for foreign
currency.
	   The 1998 budget projects oil income will increase 3 percent to
dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 970 million estimated for 1997. The
government aims to raise oil output capacity to 500,000 barrels per
day by 2000 from around 350,000 barrels daily now.
	   Al-Iryani said the country's foreign reserves have shrunk by
dlrs 142 million from dlrs 378 million in the period January-March
last year to dlrs 236 million in the same period this year. Yemen's
fiscal year begins April 1.
	   The World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to Yemen to
support its economic reform program. The government has already cut
back subsidies and stepped up privatization of state-controlled
companies as part of reforms required by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Still suffering from a devastating 1994 civil war, Yemen has a
foreign debt of some dlrs 10 billion it cannot serve. Most of its
17 million people live in poverty.
	   Al-Iryani took office on May 17, replacing Faraj bin Ghanem who
resigned amid differences with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the
real power in the country, over political and economic reforms.
Ghanem spent less than one year in office.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Pakistan feared an Israeli air strike on its
nuclear installations hours before it detonated five nuclear
devices last week, Israeli media reported Monday.
	   State-run Israel television said Pakistan's foreign minister
informed the United States about the plans last Thursday, hours
before it carried out the tests. Pakistan believed that Israeli
F-16 warplanes were in bases in India, and would operate from there
the report said.
	   The United States told Pakistan that Israel was not planning any
such attack, Israel's Channel Two Television said. The report said
Pakistan also informed United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and as well as China, where Israel's prime minister was on an
official visit last week.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied an attack was planned. ``These reports are totally
baseless,'' he told Israel TV. Israel radio reported that Israel's
ambassador to Washington Eliyahu Ben Elissar contacted his
Pakistani counterpart Monday to deny the report.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a major electoral triumph,
Montenegro's reformist president threw down a challenge to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Monday that could dent or
ultimately undo the strongman's rule.
	   In true Balkan style, supporters of President Milo Djukanovic
fired guns, waved flags and honked car horns as they showed their
joy at an unexpectedly decisive win over Milosevic protege Momir
Bulatovic in Sunday's parliamentary elections,
	   With 99.7 percent of the vote counted for the 78-seat
Montenegrin parliament, Djukanovic's coalition ``For a Better
Life'' had secured 49.5 percent of ballots cast, the State Election
Commission said.
	   Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party had 36.1 percent, the
Commission added.
	   A jubilant Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters he hoped to
build on the triumph and use it to spread democracy throughout
Yugoslavia, which now consists of just Serbia and Montenegro.
	   ``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and
resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,'' he
said.
	   Although this mountainous republic has just 630,000 residents,
it supplies the same number of deputies to the federal Yugoslav
parliament as Serbia, with 10 million inhabitants.
	   Djukanovic and his aides are determined to stack Montenegro's
bloc with their supporters, and hope to team up with Serbian
opposition deputies to vote Milosevic out.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
strongman has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic and unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo
recently have weakened his grip.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians fighting for independence appear to
be gaining ground in ever more deadly battles with Serbian police.
	   Djukanovic first threw down the gauntlet in the winter of
1996-7, coming out against Milosevic during massive protests
against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin then narrowly beat Bulatovic _ his
former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office last January.
	   The strength of his triumph in Sunday's elections could hand him
a majority in the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament. Besides
Djukanovic's and Bulatovic's parties, only one other party _ the
Montenegrin separatist Liberal Alliance _ passed the 3 percent vote
threshold needed to get seats.
	   Djukanovic aides suggested Monday that they would insist on
Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic maneuvered
his protege into that office two weeks ago after the previous
premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western reforms.
	   The big unknown Monday was Milosevic's reaction. Typically in
such situations, he bides his time, allowing media or political
aides to speak for him before acting.
	   The state news agency Tanjug said that Bulatovic's party had
accepted Sunday's results.
	   Some 120 election monitors dispatched by the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation concluded Sunday's ballot
``was generally well conducted,'' an OSCE statement said.
	   ``I'm giving these elections a clean bill of health,'' said
Javier Ruperez of Spain, heading the monitoring team.
	   The statement urged all political parties to overcome the bitter
divisions of the election campaign and ``work now at establishing a
climate of dialogue and confidence.''
	   Media control has proven critical for all ruling parties since
the old Yugoslavia, of six republics, began its bloody break-up in
1991.
	   OSCE said Montenegrin state media were biased toward Djukanovic.
But the transatlantic organization was even more critical of
Serbian state media for its vicious attacks on the Montenegrin
president during the campaign.

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - The State Government with the co-operation of
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia will hold an international conference
and exposition on investment opportunities in Selangor in
September.
	   The conference and exposition (Incel  Exsel 98) will showcase
Selangor as the prime centre for high technology and its efforts to
cut a balance between nature and development.
	   The five-day event, to be held at the Putra World Trade Centre
in Kuala Lumpur from Sept 8, will focus on prospects and continuous
investment opportunities available, especially in manufacturing.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar when launching the event
yesterday, said the State Government hoped to attract more foreign
investors to help the State become fully industrialised by 2005.
	   ``The event will also highlight the implementation of
privatisation projects in Selangor, growth prospects in tourism,
infrastructure development and global and national economic
issues.''
	   He also said, based on the current growth rate of between four
and five per cent, Selangor was confident of achieving its target
of a per capita income above RM26,000.

	   INTERNATIONAL financial software company FICS Group of Belgium
is positioning itself to tap the growing electronic banking market
of Asia in a bid to further strengthen its presence in Asia.
	   Its chief executive officer Michel Akkermans said the company
sees great potential for electronic banking in the region,
especially in countries like Malaysia and Singapore.
	   ``Asia contributed about 15 per cent of FICS' total revenue of
US$42 million (RM160 million) last year. This year, the percentage
is expected to grow with a global revenue projection of US$50
million,'' he told Computimes in a recent tele-interview.
	   Towards that end, the company has established a new regional
headquarters - FICS Asia - in Singapore to enhance local support
and increase technical capabilities to better service its clients.
	   For that purpose, FICS Asia's current staff strength of 20 is
expected to double by year-end.
	   ``We will also leverage on our business partners in the various
countries in the region,'' Akkermans said, adding that FICS Group
business partner in Malaysia is Solsis (M) Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of
Dataprep Holdings Bhd.
	   The group is also setting up a FICS development centre in
Singapore which will house technical and functional expertise to
develop Asian versions of FICS' electronic banking and regulatory
reporting products.
	   This, according to Akkermans, includes developing localised
products for the Malaysian market.
	   ``Some of our electronic banking and regulatory reporting
products are already compliant with Bank Negara's guidelines. Our
electronic cash card technology is also fully compatible with the
Banksys's Proton electronic cash scheme selected as Malaysia's new
national electronic payment system,'' he said.
	   Akkermans claimed that FICS Group is the world market leader in
the electronic banking and regulatory financial reporting areas
with about 500 customers in 26 countries who have installed FICS'
solutions complying to local standards and legal frameworks.
	   FICS Group, which was founded in 1989, focuses on two core
business activities: electronic services delivery (ESD) and
financial reporting systems (FRS).
	   The ESD products and services range from Windows-based and
Internet-enabled electronic banking solutions for retail and
corporate banking to electronic commerce and electronic purse
solutions and services.
	   The FRS offering, based on a client-server reporting system
called Abacus, addresses the regulatory financial and management
reporting needs of banks, insurance companies, pension funds,
mutual funds and brokers.

the loans, amounting to RM400,000 to Nurdin Enterprise between July
9 and Aug 26 last year.
	   They were each allowed RM100,000 bail in one surety and also
ordered to surrender their passports to the court.

	   Meanwhile, Aziz, who claimed trial to the 20 charges of abetting
them was allowed bail of RM100,000 in two sureties and ordered to
surrender his passport to the court.
	   Mohd Hafid, who was allowed bail of RM100,000 in two sureties
was also ordered to surrender his passport.
	   Zabariah fixed June 10 for the mention of Abdul Aziz's case to
enable him to engage a counsel.
	   She said she would decide then whether Abdul Aziz should be
jointly tried with the five others.
	   She allowed an application by Salehuddin for Mohd Hafid to be
jointly tried with four others.
	   Shukri, Bahrin and Hafiz were represented by Rosli Zin while
Balakrishnan and Zamanhuri were represented by Hazman Ahmad.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed plantation firm PT Astra Agro
Lestari (AAL), a subsidiary of the country's largest automaker PT
Astra International, announced Saturday that it had exported nine
metric tons of black tea worth US$18,474 to India.
	   The company said its black tea exports comprised 3.7 tons of
Broken Orange Peko (BOP) grade, two tons of Broken Orange Peko
Fanning and 3.3 tons of Broken Tea grade. India was chosen as its
main market because the country is the world's biggest tea
consumer.
	   The black tea was produced by AAL's tea plantation subsidiary PT
Bantar, which currently produces 2.7 tons of tea per day.
	   The company said that it planned to increase Bantar's production
capacity to 4.5 tons per day this year, most of which would be
exported.
	   AAL's estates cover 300,000 hectares in Sumatra, 192,758
hectares of which has been planted with palm oil, rubber, tea and
cocoa. Oil palm plantations cover 92 percent of the company
plantation area.
	   The company's net profit jumped 43 percent to Rp 90.6 billion
(US$9.06 million) last year from Rp 63.3 billion in 1996.
	   The company said that the increase in its net profit was mostly
due to the increase in the price of crude palm oil last year

	   KUALA TERENGGANU, Fri. - Out of nearly 7,000 patients admitted
into the hospital here annually, about 35 per cent were respiratory
cases.
	   The State Environmental, Health and Consumers Affair Committee
chairman Wong Foon Meng said among the types of respiratory
problems were pneumonia (728 cases), asthma (596 cases) and other
respiratory complications (782 cases).
	   ``Based on the number of respiratory cases treated at the
hospital, we feel that it is time for the hospital to have a
special unit where patients with respiratory problems can be given
proper treatment,'' he said after receiving a RM30,000 cheque from
Esso Production Malaysia Incorporation medical adviser Dr Abu
Hassan Ahmad yesterday.
	   Wong said due to the shortage of equipment, the hospital had to
borrow the apparatus from other hospitals to treat patients.
	   To have a respiratory unit complete with equipment, the hospital
requires at least RM300,000 and is appealing to the private sector
to contribute.

	   PENANG, Fri. - At least half of the 11,000 participants
registered for the International Penang Bridge Run collected their
numbers, vests and runners' guides at the Youth and Sports Complex
in Batu Uban yesterday.
	   Most of the runners who lined up to collect their numbers were
from here and neighbouring States.
	   ``There was no rush; everything went smoothly,'' Penang Amateur
Athletic Association secretary Paul Subramaniam said.
	   The booth was operated by Penang AAA officials from 5pm to 9pm.
	   A regular participant from Sungai Petani, K. Nadarajah, said
that he was impressed with the way the numbers were given out.
	   ``There was absolutely no rush, things went on properly,'' said
the 52-year-old teachers' college lecturer from Sungai Petani.
	   Meanwhile, India's favourite runner Sunita Godara is confident
of another victory in the Open category of the women's marathon.
	   The 38-year-old Sunita from New Delhi is no newcomer to Penang
as she has won the Penang MAS International Marathon five times.
	   ``If there are runners from Myanmar and Thailand, they will pose
a stiff challenge,'' said Sunita, who arrived two days ago.
	   The full marathon, introduced for the first time this year, will
see the participation of about 1,000 runners, half of whom are
foreigners.
	   Runners from the United States, Britain, Iran, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia are among those who
have signed up for the event.
	   Meanwhile, the public is reminded that several roads leading to
the Penang Bridge will be closed to traffic on Sunday for the run.
	   Georgetown deputy district traffic chief, Assistant
Superintendent Ahmad Termizi Abdul Haq, said roads will be closed
from 4.30am to 9.30am.
	   The coastal highway leading to the Bayan Lepas Industrial Free
Zone factories will also be closed.
	   Motorists are advised to use alternative routes to reach their
destinations.
	   Participants and their supporters are advised to keep to the
runners' guide provided by the organisers.
	   About 200 police personnel will be stationed at all
intersections in Georgetown and on the mainland to assist traffic
flow.
	   Detour and temporary road closure signs will also be placed in
these areas.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Economic and political uncertainty in the country
has put more commercial property projects on hold in the second
quarter of this year, according to property consultants First
Pacific Davies Indonesia (FPDI).
	   The company said that many projects stopped as economic and
political uncertainty mounted.
	   ``The majority of projects have been suspended for an indefinite
period, while others have slowed down and have revised completion
dates,'' the company said in its latest study.
	   According to the study, the retail sector has been worst hit,
with almost all new retail projects put on hold until 2000.
	   The company said that 93 percent of the total of 473,862 square
meters of retail developments that were planned have now been
suspended.
	   There is, however, 31,000 square meters still under
construction, although the rate of progress has slowed
considerably, the report said.
	   In the office sector, 1.03 million square meters or 66 percent
of confirmed developments have been put on hold. Delayed projects
are expected to increase to 84 percent of confirmed developments by
the end of 2000.
	   About 57 percent of the confirmed supply of apartments, some
14,943 units, are currently on hold. Within the next two years the
number of suspended projects will increase and an extra 3,857 units
consequently put on hold. The total number of delayed units will
then amount to 72 percent of the confirmed supply.
	   In the hotel sector, most of the projects put on hold are
four-star hotels. Seventy two percent of three-star hotel
developments have continued with construction.
	   Of all confirmed hotel projects to 2000, delayed developments
now represent 4,350 rooms, or 54 percent of the confirmed supply.
	   The number of delayed hotel projects is expected to increase to
the equivalent of 5,018 rooms, or 62 percent of the confirmed
supply for the next two years, the report said.
	   Hotel projects that are currently on hold consist of 1,483
five-star rooms, 2,416 four-star rooms and 450 three-star rooms.
	   The study shows that only 193,244 square meters of office space
will be added to the city during the rest of this year, including
10,500 square meters of strata titled offices, 51,190 square meters
of leased premises, and 131,554 square meters of strata/leased
projects.
	   Two office projects, Gedung Data Script and one tower of Taman
Perkantoran Kuningan, are due to open in the second quarter of this
year.
	   In the residential sector, Puri Imperium came on stream this
month, and FPDI estimates that 6,800 new units will enter the
market over the remainder of this year.
	   A total of 5,935 strata titled units, 108 leased units and 784
serviced units made up the new apartment units supply.
	   Of these units, 90 percent are located outside the central
business district.
	   The totals include Kempinski Plaza and Eksekutif Menteng III and
IV which are due to be completed shortly.
	   Because many of the hotel projects are already well advanced,
construction is continuing as planned.
	   The study estimates that by the end of this year, the central
business district will have an additional 360 five-star rooms and
287 four star-rooms.
	   Other areas of the city will gain an extra 915 four-star rooms
and 441 three-star rooms.
	   The hotels include the five-star Kempinski and The Park Lane,
and the four-star Menara Peninsula, all of which are expected to
open in this quarter.)

Jones wins Rochester International by two shots 
</HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Rosie Jones recovered from
consecutive bogeys down the stretch Monday to capture the Rochester
International for the second time in seven years.
	   Picking up on the back nine after thunderstorms forced the
suspension of final-round play Sunday, Jones reopened a four-stroke
lead with a 35-foot (11-meter) birdie putt on No. 10 and a 5-footer
(1.5-meter) for birdie on No. 12.
	   She bogeyed No. 14 after getting tangled in the rough and No.
15, where she three-putted, then settled down to complete an
even-par round and finish at 9-under 279, two ahead of Juli
Inkster.
	   Jones, 38, won the Rochester International in 1991 and lost in a
playoff to Kathy Whitworth in 1984. Her ninth victory in 16 years
on the LPGA tour was worth dlrs 105,000.
	   ``I cherish every win _ you wouldn't believe it,'' she said. ``I
don't get to win as much as the really great players. I have a lot
of good tournaments but I don't win as much as I'd like.''
	   Hollis Stacy, who had cut Jones' lead to two on Sunday, dropped
to third place with a 70 to finish at 6-under. Stacy captured 17
tournaments between 1977 and 1985, but she has won just once since
_ in 1991.
	   Tied for fourth at 5-under were Moira Dunn, Sherri Steinhauer
and Meg Mallon, who closed with the day's best round of 67. Another
stroke back was Alicia Dibos of Peru.
	   Jones barely matched par on the first nine Sunday, when swirling
winds, flashes of lightning and intermittent downpours stopped play
four times for a total of 5 1/2 hours.
	   Her birdie putt from just off the fringe on the 10th hole gave
her a quick boost.
	   ``I was not so nervous _ I felt pretty good _ but that just kind
of freed me up a little bit,'' she said.
	   ``It was nice that I made a couple of birdies before I made a
bogey so I felt like I had a little cushion,'' Jones said. ``I
wasn't real worried ... after two bogeys. I didn't let it get to
me.''
	   Inkster vaulted into second place with a 68, rubbing out an
opening bogey on No. 14 with a birdie putt on No. 16 and a birdie
putt on the next hole to finish at 7-under.
	   ``I was so wired last night, I didn't sleep well at all,'' she
said.
	   Defending champion Penny Hammel slumped to 4-over, one ahead of
South Korean rookie Se Ri Pak, who led the LPGA Championship from
start to finish two weeks ago.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Parliamentary Secretary Datuk Tan Chai Ho today urged insurance
companies to provide low-premium policies for lifetime healthcare.
	   Tan told a Press conference at the Putra World Trade Centre that
this was because the cost of healthcare was expected to increase.
	   ``For diabetics alone, there is an increase of 2,000 patients
per year needing regular haemodialysis,'' he said after launching a
charity art exhibition by Shirley Chu at the PWTC.
	   The exhibition, open until Sunday, is part of the National
Association of Malaysian Life Insurance Agents (Namlia)
haemodialysis charity project.
	   Tan suggested individual policies to cover single diseases which
should also meet the cost of healthcare through a patient's
lifetime.
	   Policies should distinguish between, say, heart cases which
require major surgery once or twice in a lifetime, and diabetics
who need haemodialysis three times a week.
	   Tan added he would take up the matter with relevant parties such
as associations of insurance companies and Bank Negara.
	   Namlia president Paul Naidu admitted that so far no such
policies had been introduced in Malaysia although it was common in
developed countries.
	   ``What we have so far is the critical illness policy which
covers some 30 types of illnesses,'' he said.
	   Naidu said he supported Tan's suggestion, but a policy to
support patients for the rest of their life might be unrealistic.
	   Tan suggested insurance companies work out the necessary
calculations to make the best possible policy to cover continuous
treatment.
	   ``Anyway, I think insurance companies do make a lot of money.
Why not expand it a bit for social responsibility,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Naidu said Namlia's haemodialysis centre would be
operational in two months time, starting with six haemodialysis
machines.
	   Another four would be added by the end of the year, he added.
	   Naidu said the cost of setting up the centre would be met
through a series of charity drives. Namlia had set a target of
RM1.5 million in collections, of which more than RM100,000 had been
collected so far.
	   Today's exhibition of some 80 Chinese water colours done by Chu
is expected to raise another RM100,000 as the artist intends to
donate all proceeds from her paintings to the cause.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - A retired teacher has won an international
award for his book, An Anthology of Poems, which was selected as
the Book of the Year by the University Professors Association in
south India.
	   Murasu Nedumaran of Klang will receive the award plus a
substantial amount of cash at a ceremony in south India soon.
	   His 1,080-page book which contains a collection of 650 poems of
over 250 poets covering a century (1887-1987) plus a brief
Malaysian history, was adjudged the best among 100-odd books from
all over the world, taken for review by the association last year.
	   His book portrays the history, contemporary society, politics,
economics, education, religion, culture, arts and literature of
Malaysian Indians.
	   He has won gold medals at national level on four occasions in
poem writing competitions and was awarded gold medallion by the
Malaysian Tamil Writers Association for his literary contribution
in 1986.
	   Nedumaran, 62, who has written over 20 books on poems, dramas
and stories, said his latest book which is more like a
mini-encyclopaedia, is the result of 40 years of research.
	   Nedumaran, a father of two sons and two daughters, is currently
doing his Ph.D.
	   His award-winning book will be launched by MIC president Datuk
Seri S.
	   Samy Vellu at Wisma Tatt Khalsa, Jalan Raja Bot, at 3.30pm on
Sunday.
	   Nedumaran has been contributing scripts and songs for use by the
Schools Broadcast Division (Radio) of the Education Ministry for
language programmes over the last 30 years.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings from plywood
exports is expected to fall by 25 percent this year to about US$2.6
billion from $3.58 billion last year, the Association of Indonesian
Wood Panel Producers (Apkindo) said Saturday.
	   Apkindo chairman Abbas Adhar said yesterday the lower estimate
was partly due to a 20 percent fall in export volume, caused by
sluggish demand and a reduction in production.
	   ``If the market remains unfavorable throughout the year, plywood
exports are expected to stand at about $2 billion, a record low
since 1990,'' Abbas said.
	   Last year, Indonesia exported 7.58 million cubic meters of
plywood worth $3.58 billion.
	   He said the 25 percent fall was based on an assumption that
plywood prices in the world market would increase to $300 per cubic
meter in the third quarter of this year.
	   He added that international prices of Indonesian plywood had
slightly increased last month to $270 per cubic meter from $260 per
cubic meter in March.
	   Many Indonesian plywood producers cut their production this year
following sluggish demand and an increase in production costs. But
Abbas said Apkindo would not revise its target to export eight
million cubic meters this year.
	   Indonesia is the world's biggest plywood producer, turning out
10 million cubic meters of plywood annually.
	   He said some plywood importing countries had started buying
Malaysian plywood due to the declining volume of Indonesian plywood
in the past few months.
	   But Abbas is optimistic that Malaysia, the world's second
biggest plywood producer, will not replace Indonesia's position due
to its higher prices.
	   ``Malaysian plywood is more expensive because the price of their
logs are higher than our logs,'' Abbas said, adding that Malaysian
logs sold at $90 per cubic meter while Indonesian logs sold at Rp
300,000 ($30) per cubic meter.

	   THE economic downturn may have hampered Sheraton Subang Hotels
and Towers Kuala Lumpur from organising a grand launching ceremony
for its new ballroom, but the ceremony was nonetheless an affair of
fun and good food.
	   The Selangor ballroom was officially opened on May 19 during a
cocktail reception attended by about 500 guests comprising
corporate executives, travel agents, members of a Sheraton travel
arranger programme called Choice as well as the Press.
	   On hand to greet the guests were Sheraton Subang general manager
John L.
	   Eaton, its public relations manager Stephanie Ng, its reception
manager S.
	   Puvan and Sheraton Langkawi Beach Resort sales and marketing
director Jasmine Heng.
	   The ballroom is located on ground level next to the main hotel
building on the 3.756-hectare site of Sheraton Subang.
	   It has a foyer designed like an observatory with
floor-to-ceiling glass windows, allowing maximum light to penetrate
during the day.
	   Guests were seen appreciating the new concept of the ballroom.
	   It has a unique feature of having a separate entrance and is
also accessible from the hotel lobby.
	   Eaton said the separate entrance provided convenience and
privacy to private functions.
	   He said the observatory-like design is purely for the
convenience of those using the premises.
	   ``Normally, a ballroom would either be underground or in the
centre of a hotel where it is totally enclosed.
	   ``Most people feel they are being trapped. They feel
uncomfortable and stuffy but they couldn't complain because they
think that is what a ballroom is,'' Eaton said.
	   ``With our concept, they can enjoy the sunlight and refreshing
view during a break from conference or meeting.''
	   The ballroom can seat up to 1,500 theatre-style, and 1,050 for
banquet dining.
	   It can also be divided into three smaller function halls.
	   The evening was made merrier by ``live'' performances by an
in-house band and generous offerings of Western and local food.
	   Some caricaturists were also seen going around sketching
portraits of guests while others were seen chasing their hors
d'ouevres as the tables walked away! It was, however, a gimmick. A
table was specially made and attached to a waitress and as she
walked, she carried the table with her. The table ``stopped'' when
there's a request for hors d'ouevres.
	   Also present at the function were Faber Group Bhd director Datuk
Moehamad Izat Emir and management and directors of Faber Hotels
Holdings Sdn Bhd and Renong Group of Companies.

	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The Netherlands put on a powerful
display of attacking soccer to crush Paraguay 5-1 in a clash of two
World Cup bound sides in the Philips Stadium here Monday.
	   After being criticized by coach Guus Hiddink for squandering
chances in last week's lackluster 0-0 draw with Cameroon, the Dutch
struck the target almost at will Monday.
	   ``After the Cameroon game, we needed a result like this,''
Hiddink said. ``It was important for us and for the supporters.''
	   But Hiddink said his team needed to keep its concentration in
defense even when attacking.
	   ``We gave away too many chances today,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The banking industry, a sector most affected by
the economic turmoil, suffered further when more than 500 bank
offices were damaged or burned down in the recent riots.
	   Angry mobs rampaged and burned not only the buildings, but also
ATMs. Bank Central Asia, the biggest private bank in the country,
was a major target. Almost 150 ATMs and 122 branch offices were
rampaged, looted and/or burned down.
	   As a result, as reported by the media, there were long queues in
front of the bank's ATMs still in operation. Customers waited for
hours to get to the head of the queues.
	   BCA has the most sophisticated online system out of all the
country's banks. The bank, which had almost eight million customers
before the riots, relies on its almost 1,800 ATMs.
	   Unlike ATM services provided by several other banks which allow
withdrawals only, BCA customers can also pay their telephone,
electricity and pager bills or transfer money to other BCA branches
which are online. This helps accelerate business transactions
across the country.
	   ATMs became widely used here only a few years ago. Things are
very simple, just push in your pin and account numbers and make a
transaction. When you need money, you can withdraw from an ATM
machine any time of day. Customers do not need to keep a lot of
money at home and there is no need to go to the bank frequently.
	   Due to the ease, it is not surprising that more and more people
are using ATMs. People have become used to ATMs, even dependent.
	   Over the last three years, there has been a growing focus on
core business among large users. Indonesian executives are slowly
seeing information technology as a strategic tool, which can
contribute to business performance. They are beginning to look into
information technology to help reduce costs and increase revenue.
	   The introduction of ATMs banks spread widely and a dependency on
technology grew.
	   From a customer's viewpoint, the simplicity and various features
offered by ATMs create more dependency on technology.
	   It was not easy, though, to convince the public about the
benefits of ATMs. Banks actually introduced ATMs a long time ago,
but it took years before people accepted the technology.
	   When the riots rocked Jakarta in the middle of last month, the
reliability of ATMs broke down due to vandalism. Many customers had
to delay telephone bill payments or postpone business transactions.
	   There are lots of benefits in online systems, but once the
system is interrupted, business is affected. This indicts how
dependent we have become on technology.
	   Obviously, a lot of money was spent on preparing the
infrastructure and applying the technology.
	   Now the banks which were affected by the recent riots have to
invest in new machines, rebuild branch offices and install new
systems. Even though the destruction of ATMs and branch offices
does not affect a central computer system, a backup system has to
be set up and disaster recovery system implemented.
	   However, technology needs infrastructure readiness and therefore
bringing back normalcy will take some time.

	   KLANG, Fri. - Pupils of Sekolah Menengah Tengku Ampuan Rahimah
performed a good deed by donating RM740 for the purchase of
artificial limbs for a cancer patient.
	   The idea stemmed from the plight of Rosdalilah Yaacob, a bone
cancer patient, who needed RM9,300 to buy an artifical limb.
	   Her left leg was amputated at the hip when she was five.
	   Her plight was highlighted in the New Straits Times in January
and RM18,000 has been collected so far.
	   The purchase of the limb was arranged by the New Straits Times
Press (M) Bhd.
	   The donation from the schoolchildren was organised by the
school's Welfare Club in conjunction with Teacher's Day
celebration.
	   Principal Siti Aishah Ismail presented the cheque to an NST
representative.

	   JAKARTA (JP): First of all, if you buy a new branded notebook or
desktop computer, don't forget to check the list of goodies that
should be included in the shipping box. You can usually find it in
the manual. Make sure that you have all of them, including the CDs
and diskettes of bundled programs.
	   My friend Billy bought a Toshiba 430 CDT notebook a couple of
months ago. The dealership, which was located in what was once the
venerable Computer City, delivered the notebook to his home in
Rawamangun. There was nothing wrong with the notebook until one day
he found out that he had forgotten the password he had entered when
he first set up Windows 95.
	   I told him that the easiest solution would be to use the
Recovery CD -- an installation CD-ROM that would erase everything
on the hard disk and copy the original, factory-installed operating
systems onto it. Since Billy had not been using the notebook very
much, there wouldn't be much data to back up, and this would be the
most convenient way to start over.
	   The problem was that the Recovery CD was not in the box. In
fact, the dealer had not given Billy any CD or diskette when he
bought the notebook. Since Billy and his wife had never bought a
branded notebook before, they were not aware that actually they
should also get the Recovery CD and the startup diskettes for the
notebook.
	   When Billy contacted me, it was already too late to call the
dealer and ask for the CD-ROM, as the store went up in flames on
May 14. On my suggestion, Billy took the notebook to Toshiba's main
distributor on Jl. A. M. Sangaji, Central Jakarta. Needless to say,
they had no problem restoring the hard disk back to the factory
condition. The only problem was that Billy had to cough up Rp
100,000 for the 30 minutes work. Worse, he would have to do the
same thing again if a virus strikes or the hard disk becomes too
jumbled with additional software.
	   The same story also befell another friend of mine who bought
herself a 'jangkrik' PC. She was not given the software drivers for
the PC. I have not been able to properly reinstall her PC's
operating system because the guy who assembled the PC for her did
not use a market standard mouse, video card and CD-ROM drive. I do
not have the software drivers for the brands and types of
components that he put in it.
	   When I told her to contact the guy and ask for the appropriate
software drivers, she said it wouldn't be easy to get them from
him. So, she's stuck with standard VGA display, a Logitech mouse
that I lent her, and a CD-ROM drive that cannot read MPEG files,
and there's nothing I can do for her except make sure that she can
at least work with the PC.
	   So, remember that when you buy a new PC, you should also ask for
all the necessary software drivers for the mouse, the video card,
the sound card, and perhaps even the CD-ROM drive. Consult friends
who have bought PCs in the past and write down the list of what you
should be getting in addition to the hardware.
	   Typing
	   I've also noticed that many people are hesitant about learning
to use a PC simply because they are not familiar with the keyboard.
When I first learned to use a computer, I was lucky because I had
already completed a course in typing back in the early 1970s.
Migrating from a typewriter to a computer was thus fairly easy.
	   Today it is actually much easier for people to learn touch
typing, as the skill is usually called nowadays. Several different
computer software programs allow you to learn to master the
keyboard on your own PC without the help of others. The
high-resolution graphics of today's computers also make learning a
lot more fun than it used to be. One of the best software packages
for those who want to be able to type without looking for the
individual keys is Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing from Mindscape.
	   This multimedia software comes on a CD-ROM, therefore you'll
need a PC with a CD-ROM drive and sound capabilities to really get
the maximum benefits. Installing is easy. You just pop the CD-ROM
into the drive, push the tray in and the Autorun program will load
automatically. All you have to do is click on the ``Install''
button. You could also copy the entire contents of the CD-ROM onto
your hard disk and install it from there, but I wouldn't recommend
it since it will take up a lot of hard disk space.
	   Once the program is installed, you'll have to sign in. Then you
can proceed to Beacon's classroom. You can choose to sit a test to
determine your current level of typing proficiency or you can
directly plunge into the water and follow Lesson 1. If you go for
the lessons, you'll see a keyboard with eight transparent fingers
resting on the home row. To know which finger you have to use to
type the letter that Beacon tells you to type, you can look at this
keyboard at the bottom of the screen. The appropriate key -- or
keys, if you need to press and hold down the Shift key at the same
time -- will be highlighted in green. This method of providing
examples is really intuitive.
	   Practice
	   With typing it is undoubtedly true that practice makes perfect.
For your children, this program includes seven games to make
learning really exciting. The graphics are great and will be
captivating for children, especially if your PC has a true color
display.
	   If you play music, you can choose the game called ``RagTime''. A
metronome will keep ticking as you type in the characters that
appear on the screen, and you learn to type rhythmically as true
professional typists do.
	   Or, if the games are too childish for you, you can go to the
section containing customized lessons. You can go to the English
department, where your assignment will be to type in some parts of
a dictionary. This lesson is very interesting, as you can practice
increasing your speed and accuracy while at the same time also
enrich your vocabulary.
	   By the way, while you learn, play the games or take the tests, a
rich background music will also play continuously. You have a
selection of blues, classical, country, reggae and many other beats
to type to, which you can set if you go to the Setting section.
	   Other members of the family can also sign in individually, and
they can specify their own password if they like. This way, you can
always monitor your own progress. If you want to have more
interesting and challenging games and materials to type, you can
even log on to Mavis Beacon's Internet site.
	   The ability to type is the first requirement in computer
literacy. If you have children at home, you can use this program to
teach them how to use the keyboard as early as possible. With this
excellent software, they will learn not only the location of each
key but also which finger they should use to press that key. By the
time they enter college, they'll be able to type at least as fast
as most of the secretaries in our offices today.
	   And for yourself, if you still have to search for the letter
``x'' and the character ``  '' before you can type them, you are
still ineffective in using your computer. You should also grab this
program and spend some hours on it. It's highly recommended.

	   HONGKONG Bank Malaysia Bhd reported a group pre-tax profit of
RM118.26 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 1998,
compared to a pre-tax loss of RM60.8 million recorded in the
previous quarter.
	   The first quarter's pre-tax profit figure was lower compared to
RM138.93 million recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 1997.
	   In a statement, the bank said interest income for the period
under review was at RM526.03 million, up from RM468.82 million in
the previous quarter and RM363.44 million for the first quarter of
1997.
	   Profit after tax was at RM71.22 million compared to a post-tax
loss of RM53.01 million previously and a profit after tax of
RM95.62 million in the first quarter of 1997.
	   It said total net non-performing loans, which was at 2.5 per
cent of total loans, for the period was at RM383.79 million
compared to RM289.7 million previously and RM141.52 million in the
first quarter last year.
	   General provision stood at RM269.47 million from RM228.48
million in the previous quarter.
	   Total loans provisions surged from a mere RM1 million in the
first quarter of last year to RM122 million, but added that this
was lower than the RM207 million provision in the last quarter of
1997.
	   Interest in suspense stood at RM74.81 million compared to
RM124.86 million previously and RM113.06 million in the 1997 first
quarter.
	   Hongkong Bank deputy chairman and chief executive officer Tim
O'Brien said the bank's results fo the first quarter were affected
by a recognition of emerging credit facilities.
	   ``The current economic conditions have led to a requirement for
higher general and specific provisioning. A conservative view has
been taken on specific non-performing advances and we have
increased the level of general provisions to 1.75 per cent of
advances.''
	   O'Brien added the underlying business of the bank has been
resilient and its strength has been rewarded through market share
growth income business areas.
	   ``The bank's capital position and liquidity remain strong
enabling us to continue with the steady development of our business
in 1998.''
	   Earnings per share was at 35.61 sen compared to a loss of 26.51
sen previously and 47.81 sen in the quarter ended March 31, 1997.
	   For the first three months of this year, deposits at the bank
stood at RM17.06 billion compared to RM17.99 billion previously and
RM13.80 billion in the same period last year.

	   ALAM Flora Sdn Bhd will meet with Kuala Lumpur City Hall
officers to resolve the issue of unsatisfactory garbage collection
in the ouskirts of the city.
	   The company's acting chief executive officer Mohammed Siraj
Abdul Razak said the meeting would be held as soon as possible.
	   Responding to a statement by Kuala Lumpur City Hall
director-general Datuk Noordin Razak last Tuesday that he was
unhappy with services provided by Alam Flora in the outskirts of
the city, Mohammed Siraj said the issue would be raised at the
weekly meeting next week.
	   As for the cleaning ofdrains, Mohammad Siraj said in the month
of April, Alam Flora was able to complete 95 per cent of the job.
	   ``We have a regular schedule for cleaning drains and this part
of our routine,'' he said.
	   Noordin had said that services provided by Alam Flora were far
from satisfactory based on complaints received by the local
authority's computerised complaints centre.
	   He had also said that he would raise the issue of garbage
collection and drain cleaning services with Alam Flora.

Turkish police returns blind human rights activist back to prison 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police on Monday put a blind human rights
activist back in prison after he declined to provide a medical
report for his possible pardon on health reasons, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   Esber Yagmurdereli was released from prison last November after
the government, bowing to pressure from international human rights
activists, suspended his 22-year prison term for one year because
of his high blood pressure and other unspecified health problems.
	   But Yagmurdereli, insisting he is innocent, has refused to
undergo a medical check-up and rejected an amnesty offer on health
reasons.
	   ``Freedom of expression should not be a crime,'' Yagmurdereli
told reporters as plainclothes took him away. ``We have to fight
for it.''
	   Yagmurdereli, 52, was arrested after criticizing the government
in a live television talk show last October and imprisoned near the
town of Cankiri, 130 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Ankara.
	   Yagmurdereli, a lawyer-turned-activist, was first imprisoned in
1978 on charges of trying to overthrow the government. He was freed
on parole in 1991, only to be arrested soon afterward on charges of
spreading Kurdish separatist propaganda. His arrest last year was a
parole violation that earned him a prison sentence.

	   ALAM Flora Sdn Bhd will take over urban services in Kajang,
Semenyih, Beranang, Ulu Semenyih, Hulu Langat and Cheras areas
under the Kajang Municipal Council's jurisdiction, from July 1.
	   The company will also buy over all 16 lorries and other
machinery from the council's urban services department.
	   Council president Mohd Yusup Bador told councillors at the full
board meeting yesterday that all 78 urban service contractors and
95 council workers would also be absorbed by the company.
	   He said while the physical takeover would begin on June 28,
training of contractors and workers would begin today.
	   ``Alam Flora will provide special training and briefings to
contractors and workers.
	   ``The company will also clear all illegal dumps in the district
within a month of the take over,'' he added.
	   Alam Flora senior manager Kamariah Mohd Noor, in her briefing to
councillors, said the company had been given three months to
improve cleanliness in Kajang and other urban centres in the
district.
	   She said the Kajang Municipal Council had about 53,000 property
holdings which needed such services.
	   She said services provided by Alam Flora included rubbish
collection, drain cleaning and grass cutting along roads.
	   She said before the Commonwealth Games, the company would also
provide special services in areas outside the council's
jurisdiction including grass cutting along Jalan Balakong and other
roads under private concessionaires.
	   Kamariah said the council would launch road shows, meet local
social organisations and brief residents according to zones before
the takeover.
	   She said residents can call the company's toll free hotline
1-800-880880 in Kuala Lumpur for details.

Arab ministers seek joint strategy ahead of Euro-Med conference 
</HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Foreign ministers of Arab Mediterranean
countries met here Monday to chart a common strategy against Israel
at a European-Mediterranean conference this week.
	   Israel is participating along with the Palestinian territory and
10 other Mediterranean basin countries in the June 3-4 foreign
ministers' conference in Palermo, Italy. These ministers will meet
with counterparts from the 15 European Union nations.
	   In Palermo, Israel ``will definitely try'' to keep the stalled
Middle East peace process separate from economic relations so that
it can ``continue getting economic gains (from the EU) at the
expense of any political linkage,'' Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris
Bweiz told the Arab ministers.
	   Their two-day meeting is being attended by foreign ministers of
Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and the
Palestinian Authority. Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel
Meguid also is invited.
	   Jordan is represented by its housing and public works minister,
and Mauritania by its permanent representative at the Arab League.
The 12th Mediterranean participant at Palermo is Cyprus.
	   Bweiz later said the Arab ministers agreed that it was
``impossible to separate the political aspects of the (Middle East)
peace process from the other security, economic or social
aspects.''
	   Discussions in Palermo will focus on the Euro-Mediterranean
partnership agreement, which was launched in Barcelona in 1995 to
forge closer political, economic and social ties between the two
regions.
	   Citing its dlrs 2.3 billion annual aid to the region, including
to Israel and the Palestinians, the EU is seeking a greater role in
Arab-Israeli peace-making efforts, which have been largely led by
the United States since 1991.
	   But Israel and the United States are not in favor of that.
Israel views the Europeans, especially France, as too pro-Arab.
	   Bweiz said he supported a European role in the Mideast peace
process. ``Europe is concerned with security in this region and
with nuclear situation in this region,'' he told reporters after
the three-hour meeting. He was referring to Israel's undeclared
nuclear arsenal.
	   Local newspapers said Monday the Arab ministers would discuss a
plan for dealing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
hard-line policies, which have been blamed by Arab countries for
the current stalemate in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
	   They will try to persuade the EU to take action, mainly
economic, to force Netanyahu to advance the peace process, the
reports said.
	   Bweiz said Lebanon supported current efforts to convene an Arab
summit aimed at reviving the peace process.

U.N. envoy says Angolan rebels still have armed forces 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations envoy to Angola said
Monday that the country's former rebels maintain armed units in the
bush and have failed to meet the latest deadline in the delayed
peace process.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye said UNITA was hiding troops in several of
the vast southwest African nation's 18 provinces. He declined to
specify the areas, or estimate the size of the forces.
	   Sunday's deadline for UNITA to hand over to the government the
four remaining areas it still controls had also passed unfulfilled,
Beye told a news conference.
	   Under the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace pact, UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ agreed to relinquish its control over more than half of the
country it seized during the two-decade civil war.
	   ``UNITA doesn't feel that the current context is favorable to
the extension of the state administration (to the final four
areas),'' Beye said.
	   The U.N. envoy said that the government had complied with his
demands to tone down hostile propaganda against UNITA and clamp
down on human rights abuses by the police.
	   UNITA has tabled a new proposal to hand over control of its four
strongholds by June 30, according to Beye.
	   He said he would travel to New York later this week to discuss
the proposal with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   But a speech by UNITA Deputy President Antonio Dembo on Monday
fueled uncertainty over the former rebels' stance.
	   Dembo said the government was attempting to ``wipe out'' UNITA
through ``manhunts, arbitrary detentions and the torture and murder
(of the movement's officials).''
	   UNITA's number two provided no concrete evidence for his claims
made when he formally reopened the movement's refurbished offices
in Luanda. A two-floor house that was partially destroyed in the
fighting that followed the rebels' refusal to accept defeat in 1992
elections that plunged the country back into civil war.
	   Beye said he ``disliked the tone'' of Dembo's comments.
	   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has refused to leave his central
highland stronghold at Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south
of the capital, saying he fears for his safety in Luanda.
	   War first broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal.

<TEXT>
	   ERNIE Country, 62, who calls himself the other kid from Hoboken
was at Pinky's, a second-hand store selling knick-knacks from
plastic toys to used cassettes at 156 Monroe Street belting out
``Come Fly With Me'', accompanied by music from his portable
cassette player.
	   He received applause as he sang a phrase or two that was
distinctively familiar. If you were to close your eyes, and let
your imagination run a bit, then you could have sworn that Ol' Blue
Eyes was back in town.
	   But that was not the case. It was the Friday when world woke up
to the news that Frank Sinatra had died. And Hoboken, a small town
in New Jersey across the Hudson River from Manhattan, was suddenly
the centre of media attention. It was here that 82 years ago, at
151 Monroe Street beside Pinky's, Francis Albert Sinatra was born.
	   The scores of television camera and journalists were parked near
an empty lot where a star with a picture of Sinatra had been placed
on the ground two years ago to mark the hallowed ground. There was
to be a tenement building there, a walk-up apartment complex
occupied by first and second-generation poor Italian immigrants who
decided to quit Manhattan to live there.
	   Country, who impersonates Sinatra for a living, got the call at
4.30am that Friday. It was a television reporter who broke the news
to him and wanted his comments. Of course he was sad, he said. The
man was his hero.
	   At six in the morning, Country, who now lives in Staten Island,
was in Hoboken. He was soon on television, one station after
another, sharing his grief with the millions watching the morning
news and singing ``In The Wee Small Hours of the Morning''.
	   He knew that while it was a sad occassion, it was also a chance
for some publicity. With Sinatra gone, some die-hard fans might
find him a good substitute.
	   Sinatra's death was not a tragedy. He had been ill for a while
and had not recorded any new tunes for years. But the mystique and
magic of the man, that oh so effortless singing that made him the
legend he was, remained. The New York tabloids ran special editions
that day; the Daily News simply said ``Sinatra Dead''.
	   At Pinky's, the girl behind the counter was apologetic. It must
have been the hundredth time that day that she had to tell
customers they had ran out of Sinatra's stuff. Since the star was
unveiled, there had been a constant flow of Sinatra fans paying
homage to Hoboken and the spot next door.
	   Ever the shrewd businessman and owner Pinky Cato, whose burly
figure seemed inappropriate for the name, decided to sell Sinatra
T-shirts, Sinatra mugs, pins and hats to the visiting fans.
	   But that Friday morning, when news of Sinatra's demise spread in
Los Angeles some 3,000 miles away, mourners started snapping
everything Sinatra, so much so that by 10am he sold everything.
	   Like Country, Cato sensed that even on that dark day there was a
silver lining for him. He called his supplier and told them to
start cranking as much Sinatra stuff as possible and bring them
over. People were dying for something to remember Sinatra by, and
he was not fulfilling their needs.
	   He would tell them that by the next day he would have them.
	   Just to remind the mourners who came, he had one last T-shirt
hung over a Sinatra shine that was soon beginning to grow around
the spot. There was an Italian flag, pictures of the young crooner,
letters to friends in the neighbourhood, flowers, candles, notes,
even a loaf of Italian bread -Sinatra was said to have liked them
so much he had them flown to California every once in a while.
	   At Picollo, a 15-minute walk from Monroe Street, there was also
a group of television reporters. On the restaurant window the owner
wrote ``We will always rememeber you Frank.''
	   Apart from its superb cheesesteak sandwich, the place had been
an unofficial home of the Hoboken Sinatra appreciation society. In
the backroom there was a rather tacky ensemble with wall to wall
pictures of Sinatra. Sinatra the teeny booper, the Swinging Frank,
the Cool Frank with the hat tilted somewhat, Frank as the leader of
the Rat Pack, Frank as the music's elder statesmen, etc.
	   The Hispanic cook and waiters, more comfortable with Spanish
than Italian, were slightly amused by the attention the restaurant
was getting.
	   But they looked more amused at the boss' wife, who that day was
in a dress too fine to run a restaurant in. The television cameras
must have done the trick.
	   But at Picollo that day, there was no music. For years, there
would be Sinatra's music daily from the time it openened its doors
in the morning right to the time it closed. No one else would
serenade its clients, but that local boy who made good. But that
day, only the sound of dishes being arranged could be heard.
	   Up in the Bronx, at the Yankees Stadium that night, there was a
moment of silence to remember Sinatra. The baseball players and
fans lowered their heads and had their caps to their chest. Sinatra
lives forever in Yankees Stadium where after each game his anthemic
``New York, New York''
	   would be played to send the fans home humming in the subway
trains and in their cars.
	   That night they had a series of songs between innings to keep
the place swinging. ``Luck Be A lady Tonight'' was blared through
the public announcement system, and in the cool night in the
expanse of the stadium, it sounded so right. But luck was not with
the Yankees that night. Even with a sign that read ``Win One for
Frankie'', they lost to the Minnesota Twins 7-6.
	   In Manhattan that Friday night, the Empire State Building had
its spire bathed in blue light in honour of Ol' Blue Eyes.

	   THE Kajang Municipal Council is waging war against illegal video
game parlours, some of which operate in houses, in the Hulu Langat
district.
	   Council president Mohd Yusup Badul said many of the outlets that
had been closed had re-opened at other premises.
	   He said the Selangor State Government was enacting new laws that
would allow local authorities to prosecute owners of houses used
for illegal video game operations.
	   He was speaking to reporters after witnessing the destruction of
320 video game machines confiscated by the council.
	   Mohd Yusup said 80 per cent of the machines were taken from
shophouses and the rest from homes.
	   He said the council had stopped issuing licences to video game
parlours in the district since 1995.
	   ``All video game parlours operating in the district are illegal
and action will be taken against them.''

<TEXT>
	   THE American columnist and political philosopher Walter Lippmann
once remarked that, in politics, there can be no concluding chapter
because there is always more future out in front than recorded
history behind.
	   At no point is there a pause when all problems, upheavals and
conflicts are solved and every good idea finds its proper place.
	   In Asia, with the overthrow of Suharto and the detonation of the
Indian H-bomb we have just had another jolting reminder of the
truth of this observation. At the same time, barely noticed, in
Latin America there is another event afoot that reaffirms the other
side of political life, the often successful quest for a more
orderly, self-disciplined and far-sighted world, that certainly
India and Pakistan could benefit from in their own fraught
relationship over Kashmir and Indonesia likewise with its continued
occupation of East Timor.
	   Very soon one of the world's last remaining inter-state
conflicts, between Peru and Ecuador, will be laid to rest with the
signing of an historic peace agreement.
	   For many decades Latin America has received more than its fair
share of disapprobation because of its declining relative economic
standing after the high hopes of the early years of the century
when its growth was spectacular, its penchant for dictatorship over
democracy and its leanings towards the worst income distribution of
the world's five continents.
	   Much of the critique was accurate - and part remains apposite
even now, despite widespread economic reforms, when one observes
the medieval attitudes towards the poorer classes and much of the
continent seemingly intent on diluting the benefits of its return
to democracy that marked the 1970s and 80s and the onset of a Latin
renaissance.
	   Today there seems to be a vogue for an era of ``democratic
Caesars'' -elected politicians who ask their legislatures to
re-write the constitution so they can stand for a second or even a
third term, or for voting for president, as in Bolivia last year, a
former harsh military dictator or, as looks increasingly likely in
Venezuela, a colonel who all but carried out a coup in 1992.
	   But there was always another side of Latin America that put it
in the forefront of civilisation - its belief in international law,
the avoidance of war and the supremacy of diplomacy and
negotiation.
	   It has always been a contradiction, too rarely perceived by
outsiders, that while Latin America may seem to have a life-long
fascination with the caudillo/general, its paucity of international
conflict makes it this century's most peaceful continent, a state
of being that is reflected not least in the relatively low
percentage of national income that Latin America spends on military
hardware. (Which makes it all the more contemptible that the
Clinton Administration, as a favour to the US arms industry, tried
to stoke up Latin American arms spending by reversing President
Jimmy Carter's ban on the sale of advanced warplanes to the
continent).
	   The Latin American ``gift'' to the world community of this
notion of law before war was fashioned by a distinctive group of
scholars active in the years leading up to World War II, including
Ricardo Alfaro of Panama, Antonio de Bustamente of Cuba, Epitacio
Pessoa of Brazil, Francisco Urrutia of Colombia and most important,
the Chilean, Alejandro Alvarez. It was Alvarez who led the effort
to show how the basis of international law as it developed after
World War 1 was fundamentally wrong, with its stress on the
independence of states. His emphasis was on the ``Interdependence
of states''. ``This is'', he wrote, ``the foundation of their
reciprocal relations, and mutual assistance is the condition for
their peaceful co-existence and their mutual and moral
development''.
	   Although World War II appeared to suffocate this thinking it did
in fact survive to play an important part in the post-war order,
not just in the proclamations of international law societies but in
the way that states went about formulating their ideas of their own
relations and the rules that ought to govern them.
	   This historic peace agreement points up the relevance of these
political ideas. Ecuador and Peru have been arguing about a piece
of (oil-rich) Amazon forest since Spanish colonial times - which
puts India's and Pakistan's quarrel or Indonesia's and East Timor's
or, come to that, Israel's and the Palestinians' into perspective.
In 1995 the two countries briefly went to war which animated
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the US, working together to broker a
series of peace negotiations.
	   Ecuador has now given up its claim, but Peru, embracing
Alvarez's principles, will give Ecuador permanent access to the
Amazon - a permeable border in effect.
	   Latin America now wants to make money, not war. If Asia and
Africa, not to mention Greece, Turkey and ex-Yugoslavia in Europe,
could learn from Latin America about the superiority of law over
war not only would there be more peace, there would be more
prosperity - and the world will have taken a great step away from
Lippmann's sophisticated pessimism towards Alvarez's more
considered optimism.

	   PAKISTAN has ignored world opinion not to take the same path
that India travelled two weeks ago in testing nuclear its
capability. At 5-5 in one month alone, the score is tied and honour
has perhaps been satisfied.
	   Has the detonation of nuclear devices been worth it in a
tit-for-tat grudge match? Pakistanis themselves will have to weigh
the answer against the larger risk of economic and social
repercussions, and decide if pride alone will suffice to sustain a
population of 140 million. The bite of an immediate shutdown of
external humanitarian and development aid will be felt long after
the euphoria fades. Pakistan's only consolation may be that its
erstwhile neighbour is dealing with the same fallout.
	   Not too long ago, there was a glimmer of hope that India and
Pakistan were finally meeting on common ground to resolve an enmity
that has stretched over 50 years. The nuclear tests need not mean
an end of this, but could become yet another area in which they
work towards a lasting understanding that is beneficial to both
countries. And it could begin with them signing the 1996
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   India's earlier assurance that it would conduct a strategic
review of its nuclear programme must be met with a similarly
unequivocal undertaking by Pakistan. Indeed, both must further
declare a moratorium against taking that next step which would
result in nuclear weapons being designed and built. Regional
stability depends on this, as does the protection of humanity from
the disastrous outcome of playing with nuclear warheads.
	   With the latest episode, the global community can no longer
afford to dither over tough decisions. The five major nuclear
powers especially have to show greater seriousness in implementing
nuclear arms disarmament conventions. The US, Britain, Russia,
China and France can hardly preach when they have practised all
that they now seek to ban. It is time to disband the club. For so
long as this is not done, there will always be some ambitious
country or other trying to make a point, just for the sake of doing
so.
	   Pakistan and its leaders can expect to feel the same stinging
denouncement by world leaders that accompanied India's venture into
what is considered forbidden territory. As it is, the response has
been predictable and instantaneous - the US imposing sanctions,
Japan withdrawing aid, Australia cutting military ties and dropping
official visits, and Germany stopping talks on economic
development. Pakistan, now in a state of emergency, has battened
down the hatches and is looking to wait out the storm of
disapproval.
	   The nuclear arms race does the world no good at all. There are
more productive ways in which mankind can utilise resources for its
own progress, to leave a constructive rather than destructive
legacy. More is to be gained from investing in peace than preparing
for the eventuality of war. After two World Wars and numerous armed
conflicts, no further proof is needed that war is a wanton waste of
the earth's most precious resource -life.
	   If national leaders refuse to see this, then the potential
victims of aggression must claim their rights through national
democratic processes.
	   Economic, social and health arguments will prevail over military
insecurities and political posturing. Long after the dust settles
on test sites, it will be ordinary citizens who will continue to
carry the burden of the nuclear arms race.

	   KUALA Lumpur City Hall, preparing for the 16th Commonwealth
Games to be held between Sept 11 and 21, has stopped issuing new
permits for road digging and other work that might mar the beauty
of the city.
	   Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said many roads in the
federal capital, in particular those outside the city centre, had
been resurfaced.
	   He said all roads in the city will be resurfaced before the
Games.
	   He was speaking to reporters after chairing the Kuala Lumpur
City Hall Advisory Board meeting on Saturday.
	   Kamaruzzaman said contrary to criticism from the media that
Kuala Lumpur has too much built-up area and too few green lungs,
the city had more than 450ha of parks and playgrounds that were in
good condition.
	   He said Kuala Lumpur will be presented as the ``Garden City of
Lights''for the Games.
	   Kamaruzzaman said landscaping work was being carried out all
over the city with the International Garden project in Bukit Jalil
an added attraction.
	   He said he has asked the contractor for the turnkey project,
Seri Merga Construction Sdn Bhd, to finish part of the garden in
time for the Games although this was not specified in the contract.
	   He was confident that the garden, which will feature a boating
pond, an ornamental lake, a picnic site and a cascading waterfall,
will be completed in time for the Games.
	   The garden will have 28 international themed gardens with 10
expected to be ready.
	   The international gardens include those depicting English,
Japanese, Iranian, Dutch, Peruvian, Indonesian, Thai, Canadian,
Chinese and Malaysian themes and will cost a total of RM30 million.
	   Kamaruzzaman said more areas in Kuala Lumpur will be turned into
gardens under a City Hall plan to create a bigger green belt.
	   He had said a total of 400ha in several areas including Pudu
Hulu, Taman Metropolitan, Kepong, Jinjang Utara, Taman Manjalara
and Taman West Valley in Bukit Kiara had been identified for the
project.
	   He said the 400-metre long and 30-metre wide pedestrian mall
project at Jalan P. Ramlee was still on the cards.
	   City Hall is in the process of signing a privatisation agreement
with the contractor undertaking the project.
	   ``The project is very much on and we hope it will be ready for
the Games.
	   It will be an added attraction to both local and foreign
tourists visiting the city.
	   ``The mall, situated behind Holiday Inn on the Park and other
commercial buildings, will be landscaped with indigenous plants, of
both the flowering and non-flowering variety. It will also be lined
with kiosks selling refreshments and souvenirs.''
	   The mall, Kamaruzzaman said, would be an ideal place to take a
stroll.
	   He sees local and foreign tourists relaxing amidst the lush
greenery.
	   He added that the mall was unique as it would actually be
sitting on a box drain culvert covered with earth.
	   Kamaruzzaman said as part of the on-going beautification
campaign, he will launch the ``Love Your Drain and River'' campaign
on the banks of the Sungai Gombak near the Putra World Trade Centre
on Aug 8.
	   This year, City Hall has a RM53 million development budget, of
which RM11 million will be for the maintenance and upkeep of
rivers.
	   From the RM11 million, RM3 million is being spent on keeping
rivers clean while the rest is for the deepening, maintenance,
canalising and infrastructure work on eight rivers passing through
the Federal Territory.
	   Kamaruzzaman said City Hall was also intensifying efforts to get
building owners to repaint their buildings by the end of next
month.
	   Those failing to do so will be billed after the local authority
has undertaken the task for them.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - Poultry farmers should live in harmony with the
environment and society, says Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr
Sulaiman Daud.
	   He said he would like to see a commitment by the industry to
restructure itself further so that conflict could be reduced.
	   Poorly managed farms too close to housing projects made for a
negative image, as they caused pollution, he said.
	   Dr Sulaiman said the industry would have to be realistic about
the complaints of pollution and make efforts to overcome the
problems associated wth poultry farming.
	   The industry would do well to consider the possibilities of
integrating itself with other major agriculture sector activities.
	   ``For instance, poultry operations should consider relocating
their farms into the oil palm plantations.
	   ``This arrangement would not only create a more friendly
environment away from human habitat but would also provide good
protection as the trees could act as buffer zones between farms,''
he said at a dinner hosted by the Leong Hup Holdings Bhd held in
conjunction with its 10th anniversary.
	   ``In a modernising society where industrialisation and
manufacturing is in the forefront of economic growth, we should be
proud that the poultry industry has not lagged behind in the
development of its growth potential.
	   ``With no direct subsidies from the Government, the poultry
sector has the vision to seek business partners from overseas to
help build a production system.''
	   He added that from the estimated RM1.4 billion import bill for
feed ingredients, Malaysia produced RM4.18 billion ex-farm value of
livestock, of which poultry and eggs were valued at RM2.82 billion.
	   He said the ministry would continue to look for an economically
viable local substitute for expensive imported feed.
	   ``Looking into the future, the major poultry producers will have
to be more vertically and horizontally integrated. This will be a
part of the on-going transformation process of the industry.
	   ``I would also like to see a win-win situation created between
the existing small and independent scale farmers and producers and
the integrators.''
	   He said one way was for independent farmers to be clustered or
become contract growers to integrators. In the transformation, the
big producers must continue to ensure that the independent farmers
had an equal chance of continuing their operations.
	   Also present were Leong Hup Holdings executive director Datuk
Francis Lau, Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk
Dr Hadi Hashim, Arbor Acres Asian division manager and
vice-president Gordon Lawrence and Arbor Acres Pacific Area manager
David Hutchinson.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The pegging of regional currencies to the
US dollar was a major contributor to the financial problems in
several Asean member states.
	   ``Pegging to the US dollar was the biggest problem,'' said Prof
Jomo K.S., of Universiti Malaya's economics faculty.
	   He added that the peg allowed foreign fund managers to gain
access to some of the economies.
	   ``This resulted in economies in the region continuing to record
positive growth rates and thrive,'' he said.
	   He was addressing international students at the final day of the
four-day Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations
Conference at Putra World Trade Centre today.
	   The conference, entitled Asia in Transition: Beyond the Miracle
saw a gathering of top students from renowned universities
worldwide to exchange perspectives on critical international
issues.
	   Another issue which should be resolved is whether current
account deficits contributed to the problem.
	   ``This is not possible as it was covered by the entry of foreign
funds,'' he said.
	   Citing Malaysia, Joko said the Labuan International Offshore
Financial Centre enabled the circulation of foreign currencies in
the country.
	   ``It allowed easy entry of foreign funds.''
	   On claims by certain quarters that ``crony capitalism''
contributed to the regional problem, Joko said this was a matter of
interpretation.
	   ``It (crony capitalism) cannot explain the crisis,'' he said,
adding that it did not undermine the rapid growth that took place
in the region.

Dodgers designate Nomo for assignment AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hideo Nomo's career with the Los Angeles
Dodgers came to an abrupt halt Monday when the team designated the
Japanese right-hander for assignment.
	   Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, met with Dodgers executive vice
president Fred Claire on Sunday and asked for a move to be made.
	   Nomo, who put Japan on the U.S. major league map in 1995 when he
signed a contract with the Dodgers and became an immediate star,
was just 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA this season.
	   The move removes Nomo from the Dodgers' 40-man roster
immediately. The team has 10 days to either trade the 29-year-old
right-hander or assign his contract.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Pakistan feared an Israeli air strike on its
nuclear installations hours before it detonated five nuclear
devices last week, Israeli media reported Monday.
	   State-run Israel television said Pakistan's foreign minister
informed the United States about the plans last Thursday, hours
before it carried out the tests. Pakistan believed that Israeli
F-16 warplanes were in bases in India, and would operate from
there, the report said.
	   The United States told Pakistan that Israel was not planning any
such attack, Israel's Channel Two Television said. The report said
Pakistan informed United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
China, which Israel's prime minister was visiting last week.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied an attack was planned. ``These reports are totally
baseless,'' he told Israel TV. Israel radio reported that Israel's
ambassador to Washington Eliyahu Ben Elissar contacted his
Pakistani counterpart Monday to deny the report.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - The Immigration and Customs and Excise
departments have been told to improve their services at the Bukit
Kayu Hitam checkpoint so that vehicles transporting goods are
cleared faster for entry into Thailand.
	   Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Wira Mohd Ali Rustam said he had
received complaints that enforcement officers took a long time to
inspect the vehicles.
	   ``I have been told that sometimes they take half a day to
inspect just one vehicle. Their counterparts at the Causeway take
only two hours to clear each vehicle.''
	   He was speaking after closing the orientation programme at
Universiti Telekom yesterday.
	   Mohd Ali said the departments could assign more manpower to
handle the task.
	   ``This was brought up at a post-Cabinet meeting a few weeks ago
and I hope the departments could work together to improve their
services.''
	   He also said he had not received any memorandum from the
Pan-Malaysian Lorry Association on difficulties which their members
faced in view of the economic downturn.
	   The association, who claims to have 100,000 members, had
recently stated that some of its members, had been forced to quit
due to the downturn.
	   It wanted the ministry to assist them by offering the 5,000
lorry permit holders, haulier licences.
	   Mohd Ali said the ministry could not offer such assistance.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - State Governments have been told to abide by the
Agriculture Ministry's guidelines when gazetting their islands as
marine parks.
	   Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud said the ministry had
received many applications from the States to gazette their islands
this year.
	   ``We will only approve those which follow our guidelines to
ensure that once the islands are gazetted as marine parks, no
fishing is allowed in the two-kilometre radius around the island.''
	   He said some States dictated their own terms and conditions in
their applications.
	   ``The ministry has its own guidelines and the States must follow
them.
	   The guidelines are to make the islands a breeding ground for
fish as well as for the growth of corals.
	   ``We would like to have more marine parks. But before the island
is gazetted, we must ensure that we do not pose problems to
fishermen,'' he said, commenting on the proposal by Malacca to
gazette Pulau Besar and Tanjung Tuan as fish and coral conservation
zones.

U.N. envoy says Angolan rebels still have armed forces 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations envoy to Angola said
Monday that the country's former rebels maintain armed units in the
bush and have failed to meet the latest deadline in the delayed
peace process.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye said UNITA was hiding troops in several of
the vast southwest African nation's 18 provinces. He declined to
specify the areas, or estimate the size of the forces.
	   Sunday's deadline for UNITA to hand over to the government the
four remaining areas it still controls had also passed unfulfilled,
Beye told a news conference.
	   Under the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace pact, UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ agreed to relinquish its control over more than half of the
country it seized during the two-decade civil war.
	   ``UNITA doesn't feel that the current context is favorable to
the extension of the state administration (to the final four
areas),'' Beye said.
	   The U.N. envoy said that the government had complied with his
demands to tone down hostile propaganda against UNITA and clamp
down on human rights abuses by the police.
	   UNITA has proposed to hand over control of its four strongholds
by June 30, according to Beye.
	   He said he would travel to New York later this week to discuss
the proposal with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   But a speech by UNITA Deputy President Antonio Dembo on Monday
fueled uncertainty over the former rebels' stance.
	   Dembo said the government was attempting to ``wipe out'' UNITA
through ``manhunts, arbitrary detentions and the torture and murder
(of the movement's officials).''
	   UNITA's number two provided no concrete evidence for his claims
made when he formally reopened the movement's refurbished offices
in Luanda. A two-floor house that was partially destroyed in the
fighting that followed the rebels' refusal to accept defeat in 1992
elections that plunged the country back into civil war.
	   Beye said he ``disliked the tone'' of Dembo's comments.
	   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has refused to leave his central
highland stronghold at Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south
of the capital, saying he fears for his safety in Luanda.
	   War first broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal.

Flights continue as government intervenes in airline strike

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Aeromexico flights remained on schedule
Monday after the government took over operations of Mexico's
largest airline and striking flight attendants agreed to work.
	   The government's decision to temporarily seize the airline left
the 1,033 unionized flight attendants with little choice but to
continue working and wait for negotiations to resume, said Lizette
Clavel, a spokeswoman for the Unionized Association of Flight
Attendants. But she said the move put the union at a disadvantage
in bargaining.
	   The union declared the strike at midnight Sunday, charging the
airline was unwilling to negotiate better working conditions and
pay.
	   The government responded by taking over management control and
appointing an acting general administrator. Mexico's constitution
gives the government the right to temporarily seize companies vital
to the nation's economy or security.
	   Aaron Dychter, undersecretary of transportation, said at a news
conference that the government was not taking sides in the dispute,
but was protecting the public interest in taking over an airline
that carries about 30,000 passengers a day.
	   ``We cannot allow, or think about, putting in risk the national
economy,'' he said.
	   The government had been prepared to use replacement workers and
non-union flight attendants to maintain as much of its schedule as
possible.
	   Union members decided it would be ``the lesser evil'' to return
to work, the union's secretary-general, Alejandra Barrales
Magdaleno, told the Televisa television network.
	   Although close to agreement on wage issues, the union and
airline are fighting over benefits and working conditions. Flight
attendants want a pension plan, better health benefits and
guarantees on flight staffing. Aeromexico wants to increase shifts
by two hours and reduce the time between shifts.
	   Labor problems weren't evident at Mexico City's airport Monday
morning. No pickets were in sight and television monitors listed
Aeromexico's flights as ``on time.''
	   Jose Luis Nieves, traveling on Aeromexico to Acapulco for a
business convention, said he was relieved to hear that flight
attendants were still on the job.
	   ``I hope that there aren't any last-minute surprises,'' he said.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - The Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council will
seek public support in dealing with tough problems, including those
involving squatters and illegal hawkers.
	   Incoming KKMC president Datuk Dayang Adeline Leong said this
after taking over the post from Stephen Shee today. Shee had served
as the president for 10 months.
	   ``Squatters are bound to sprout anytime and anywhere but the
KKMC cannot give up on that situation.
	   ``I believe we need to get co-operation from the public,
especially on giving information on new squatter settlements.''
	   She said there was a `whole range of departments' in the KKMC
which must work as a unit to achieve goals.
	   Leong, who had been the director of the State Library for 25
years, is the first woman in Sabah to hold a municipal council
president's post.
	   She is also chairman of the Sabah Information Technology
Committee's Working Committee on IT in Social Development.
	   Leong, 48, a mother of two, obtained her Bachelor of Arts in
Asian Studies at the Australian National University, Canberra and
Post-Graduate Diploma in Librarianship at the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology.
	   She has headed various organisations like the Toastmasters Club,
Sabah Women Advisory Council, Sabah Women Entrepreneurs
Professional Association, Sabah Government Officers Association,
Intan Jaycees and is a member of the International Federation of
Library Association and the Institute for Development Studies
Sabah.
	   She will start work on Tuesday.

	   SILICON Navigator Sdn Bhd has been appointed the distributor for
US company Internet Security Systems Inc's products and security
consultancy services for Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, following
a signing ceremony between both parties yesterday.
	   Silicon Navigator is a hub for research and development
activities within the Silicon group of companies, and began
offering internet security services 18 months ago.
	   ISS, listed on Nasdaq, focusses on protecting network and
information from any malicious intent and action.
	   Following the partnership, Silicon Navigator will provide
security consulting services based on ISS products and will be the
major distributor for SAFESuite products, namely RealSecure.
	   RealSecure is an automated, real-time attack recognition and
response system for enterprises. It protects information assets by
automatically detecting and responding to both internal and
external security breaches.
	   Potential customers include those from banking and finance,
telecommunications, internet service providers, and government
agencies which handle a lot of data and corporations with large
networks.
	   Silicon Navigator chief executive officer Kho Han Mien said
security breaches are serious as they are difficult to detect.
	   Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
witnessed the signing ceremony in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Later at a Press conference, Leo Moggie, citing statistics from
International Data Corporation, said electronic commerce in
Malaysia, which accounted for just US$4 million(RM15.2 million)
worth of sales in 1997, was expected to grow to US$95 million next
year, and US$1 billion by 2001.
	   He said the explosive use of the Internet had led to its
acceptance as a practical medium of communication for individuals,
corporates, and others.
	   ``As more and more people begin to conduct business on the
Internet, security has emerged as a crucial factor for the
successful conduct of electronic commerce.''
	   Last year, Malaysia pioneered the enactment of several cyberlaws
to ensure a fair, stable and secure environment free from fraud,
counterfeiting and piracy.
	   He said the Data Protection Act, being considered and drafted,
was likley to be tabled in Parliament by year end.
	   ``It is our intention to make sure that data will be properly
secured.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hideo Nomo's career with the Los Angeles
Dodgers came to an abrupt halt on Monday when the team removed the
Japanese right-hander from the roster.
	   Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, met with Dodgers general manager Fred
Claire on Sunday and asked for a move to be made.
	   Nomo, who put Japan on the U.S. major league map in 1995 when he
signed a contract with the Dodgers and became an immediate star,
was just 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA this season.
	   Los Angeles designated Nomo for assignment. The move removes him
from the Dodgers' 40-man roster immediately. The team has 10 days
to either trade or assign the 29-year pitcher, or seven days to
place him on unconditional release waivers.
	   Nomo, who became the fastest pitcher in U.S. Major League
history to record 500 strikeouts when he accomplished the feat in
444 2-3 innings 13 months ago, had gone downhill since 1995, when
he was the National League Rookie of the Year.
	   He was booed in his most recent start _ against Cincinnati on
Saturday when he allowed seven hits and six runs in 3 2-3 innings
while walking three and striking out three.
	   Nomo has lost four straight decisions, and he has allowed 18
earned runs in his last 26 2-3 innings.
	   Claire said Nomura called him Saturday night and asked for a
meeting.
	   ``Hideo had expressed the thought that it would be best to make
a move,'' Claire said at a Dodger Stadium news conference. ``This
was the best move to accommodate that request.''
	   Nomo is signed through the end of the season and is earning dlrs
2.7 million this year _ his fourth with the Dodgers. He is not
eligible to become a free agent.
	   ``Maybe a chance of scenery would be beneficial for Hideo,''
said Nomura, who cited recent trade rumors, causing his client to
want to pitch somewhere else. ``Just a change in the environment.''

Netherlands puts on powerful attacking show to crush Paraguay

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ The Netherlands put on a powerful
display of attacking soccer to crush Paraguay 5-1 in a clash of two
World Cup bound sides in the Philips Stadium here Monday.
	   After being criticized by coach Guus Hiddink for squandering
chances in last week's lackluster 0-0 draw with Cameroon, the Dutch
struck the target almost at will Monday.
	   ``After the Cameroon game, we needed a result like this,''
Hiddink said. ``It was important for us and for the supporters.''
	   But Hiddink said his team needed to keep its concentration in
defense even when attacking.
	   ``We gave away too many chances today,'' he said.
	   Marc Overmars scored twice and set up another goal before being
substituted to a standing ovation in the 71st minute.
	   Paraguay took a surprise lead in just the second minute when
Jorge Campos chested down a headed pass from Jose Cardozo and
immediately volleyed the ball low to Edwin van der Sar's right.
	   Van der Sar, appearing to think the ball was going wide, made no
effort to save it and watched helplessly as the shot hit the back
of the net.
	   The Netherlands gradually clawed its way back into the game as
Arsenal's Overmars repeatedly beat defenders down the left flank.
	   In the 8th minute, Patrick Kluivert tipped an Overmars cross
just over the bar and five minutes later Overmars headed on a pass
to Ronald de Boer who controlled the ball on is chest and volleyed
just over the bar in a near repeat of Paraguay's opening goal.
	   It was Overmars, the Netherlands' most dangerous player, who
scored the equalizer, shooting low into the corner of Paraguayan
goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert's net after a deft pass from
Kluivert in the 26th minute.
	   Kluivert and Overmars combined again in the 29th minute to give
the Netherlands a 2-1 lead. Kluivert's powerful drive was well
saved by Chilavert but Overmars was on hand to tap in the rebound.
	   And it was the same pair who teamed up two minutes later to give
the Netherlands a 3-1 lead. Overmars beat two defenders and took
the ball to the touch line before squaring it to Kluivert who shot
home from close range.
	   The Netherlands continued its trademark fluent attacking soccer
after the break.
	   Substitute Boudewijn Zenden set up the fourth Dutch goal,
crossing in the 58th minute for captain Frank de Boer to head in.
	   Paraguay should have pulled a goal back in the 67th minute when
Miguel Benitez found himself with only replacement goalkeeper Ed de
Goey to beat, but put his shot wide.
	   Zenden came close to scoring a spectacular goal in the 72nd
minute. He picked up the ball on his own halfway line and beat
tackle after tackle before unleashing a powerful shot that beat the
goalkeeper but crashed off the inside of the post and rebounded to
safety.
	   Jimmy Hasselbaink made it 5-1 in the 83rd minute, calmly sliding
in a pass from Kluivert.
	   The Netherlands takes on Belgium, South Korea and Mexico in
World Cup qualifying Group E while Paraguay has a tough task in
Group D where it meets Spain, Bulgaria and Nigeria.
	   The Dutch take on Nigeria Friday in their last warm-up match
before leaving for France.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar (Ed de Goey, 45), Michael
Reiziger, Jaap Stam (Winston Bogarde, 45), Frank de Boer, Arthur
Numan, Clarence Seedorf (Boudewijn Zenden, 45), Aron Winter,
Phillip Cocu (Edgar Davids, 45), Marc Overmars (Jimmy Hasselbaink,
71), Ronald de Boer, Patrick Kluivert.
	   Paraguay: Jose Luis Chilavert, Francisco Arce, Catalino Rivarola
(Pedro Sarabia, 45), Carlos Gamarra, Celso Ayala, Jose Cardozo
(Cesar Ramirez, 56), Carlos Paredes, Miguel Angel Benitez, Julio
Cesar Enciso, Denis Caniza, Jorge Campos (Hugo Brizuela, 63).

Fifteen condemned to death for sedition in Equatorial Guinea 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A military court sentenced 15 people to
death for sedition in Equatorial Guinea on Monday at the end of a
mass trial of more than 100 people, according to Spanish news
reports.
	   The sentences were revealed in Madrid by representatives of the
opposition to President Teodoro Obiang who also reported that the
remaining defendants had received jail sentences of between six and
24 years, Spanish national radio said.
	   The charges stemmed from an attack in January on a military
barracks on the Guinean island of Bioko _ the home of most of the
ethnic Bubi minority in this tiny central west African country.
	   Many of the condemned belong to the Bioko Autonomy Movement, an
outlawed political group that strongly opposes Obiang.
	   ``The sentences are outrageous'' a spokesman for the group said
on Spanish radio, claiming that confessions had been forced out of
accused with torture.
	   ``This can only bring instability to Equatorial Guinea'' he
said.
	   The human rights group Amnesty International, along with several
European countries and the United States, has long accused Obiang's
government of human rights violations.
	   Obiang seized power in this oil-rich country wedged between
Cameroon and Gabon in 1979 by overthrowing his uncle Francisco
Macias Nguema.
	   Some 500 people, mostly Bubi, were arrested in the military
crackdown that followed the January attack, which left four
soldiers and one civilian dead.
	   Amnesty claimed four of the detained died in custody and sent
two observers to the mass trial in Malabo _ the capital of this
former Spanish colony of about 400,000 inhabitants.
	   Calls to Amnesty on Monday went unanswered.
	   Spanish journalists covering the trial were asked to leave the
country last Friday after they reported that some of the accused
had been tortured. A precise figure for the number of those tried
could not be obtained.
	   Monday's sentences prompted Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes to send a letter to his Guinean counterpart calling on
Obiang to pardon the lives of the 15 condemned to death, national
radio said. The Spanish Socialist Party issued a statement
describing the trial as ``full of irregularities.''
	   The trial was of particular interest in Madrid because four
Spaniards of Guinean origin were among the defendants. They were
absolved of all charges, the radio reported.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Although she lost her bid to become
Colombia's first female president, Noemi Sanin jolted the two-party
system that has dominated the nation's politics for more than a
century.
	   Hers was the first independent candidacy to seriously challenge
the Liberal and Conservative parties' power monopoly, giving Sanin
unprecedented influence over the country's political future.
	   The No. 1 question today in Colombia is ``What will Sanin do?''
	   A former Conservative and foreign minister, Sanin placed third
in Sunday's first round behind Liberal Horacio Serpa and
Conservative Andres Pastrana. Now, Serpa and Pastrana, each of whom
got 35 percent of the vote, will be courting the 2.8 million
voters, or 27 percent of the electorate, that backed the upstart
Sanin.
	   ``They are drooling over Noemi's votes,'' said Andres Franco, a
Javeriana University political analyst.
	   In speeches Sunday, both Serpa and Pastrana made thinly
disguised overtures to Sanin voters, who analysts say will go
mainly to Pastrana.
	   Sanin, one of 15 children from a middle-class family, has
refused to endorse either man.
	   ``It would be wrong for me to tell the millions of Colombians
who voted for me whom they should vote for in the second round,
because their very nature is independent,'' Sanin said after
recognizing defeat Sunday.
	   But even refusing the role of kingmaker, Sanin may wield
tremendous power for someone who just lost an election.
	   At minimum, analysts say, she has toppled gender barriers and
tapped into social changes that may threaten the two-party system
in this violence-wracked country, where politicians must grapple
with a 34-year-old leftist insurgency, drug traffickers and rampant
corruption.
	   ``Noemi Sanin has demonstrated that soon a woman will become
president,'' said Pastrana.
	   Chief campaign advisor Miguel Silva said Sanin's media-based
campaign resonated among a booming urban population that clamors
for change and refuses to take instructions from party machines.
	   Indeed, Sanin won the vote in Bogota and the country's
next-largest cities, Cali and Medellin.
	   She attracted far fewer votes in the rural heartland, which
holds about two-thirds of the vote and where the party machines are
strongest.
	   ``In the small towns, you still need a party. You need a
political organization,'' said Silva.
	   Previous attempts to breathe fresh air into the two-party
structure have been squashed or fizzled out.
	   But even if she is up against history, Sanin is determined to
make her mark.
	   ``We will become the political conscience of the nation,
demanding a fight against corruption, economic recovery and the
search for peace,'' Sanin said Sunday.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hideo Nomo's career with the Los Angeles
Dodgers came to an abrupt halt on Monday when the team removed the
Japanese right-hander from the roster.
	   Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, met with Dodgers general manager Fred
Claire on Sunday and asked for a move to be made.
	   ``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Claire
said. There is a time frame. That being said, there is also a great
demand for pitching.''
	   Nomo, who put Japan on the U.S. major league baseball map in
1995 when he signed a contract with the Dodgers and became an
immediate star, was just 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA this season.

	   Nomo said little during a brief news conference. But, through an
interpreter, he said it was true he ``definitely needed a change of
scenery, a change of environment,'' and that the boos he heard
Saturday were not significant.
	   ``I'm truly grateful for everything the Dodgers did provide me,
with an opportunity to fulfill a dream.''
	   Nomo was the 1995 National League Rookie of the Year and struck
out 500 faster than any other pitcher, accomplishing the feat in
444 2-3 innings. But he's stumbled of late and was booed in his

request.''
	   Nomo is signed through the end of the season and is earning dlrs
2.7 million this year _ his fourth in the big leagues.
	   To fill Nomo's roster spot, the Dodgers purchased the contract
of 25-year-old left-hander Gary Rath from Albuquerque of the
Pacific Coast League.

	   The trial was of particular interest in Madrid because four
Spaniards of Guinean origin were among the defendants. They were
absolved of all charges, the radio reported.

Thousands of refugees flee fighting in Kosovo; dozens reported dead,0620

RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details. EDITS to tighten.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees from Serbia's
Kosovo province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to
escape some of the deadliest fighting in months. Dozens of people
were reported killed.
	   Albania appealed to the United States and European Union to
intervene in what it said was a ``massacre'' in Kosovo.
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragic dimensions,'' the
Albanian government said in a statement.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the bloodshed appeared the worst since
March, when Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on militants among the ethnic Albanian majority in
Serb-ruled Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of villages near the border with Albania.
He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars being fired into the
villages.
	   Refugees said a 3-year-old child died en route to Albania.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians were killed over the
weekend. Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were
killed when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 45
miles west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Serb sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The fierce fighting forced about 2,000 Kosovo Albanians _ mostly
women, children and the elderly _ across the border into Albania's
Tropoja (pronounced Tro-POH-yah) region on Sunday and Monday,
Albania said. They said more were arriving by the hour.
	   In Tropoja, some refugees said they had walked for up to 20
hours to reach the Albanian town. They said Serb tanks were
positioned inside Decani, and that Serb forces were besieging the
town.
	   Tropoja, although some three miles inside Albanian territory,
resembled a community under siege, with most of the men carrying
rifles or other weapons. Some men displayed the insignia of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the militant Kosovo organization
spearheading the fight against Serbia.
	   Andrew Harper, a U.N. aid worker, said he purchased three tons
of flour, rice and other basics on the local market to provide for
the refugees, and more aid was expected from Tirana, the Albanian
capital, on Tuesday.
	   ``I am very worried about providing for all these people,'' said
Isa Memia, the town leader. ``We have grave (supply) problems
ourselves, but they are our kinsmen, and we will help them.''
	   Authorities in Serbia are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The conflict has killed more than 200 people in Kosovo since the
beginning of March. About half of the province is believed
controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked off,
either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 15 miles
west of Pristina. It said one had had his throat slit.
	   According to the ethnic Albanians' account, Serb police burst
into Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to, ``Go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in the
Yugoslav federation.

Sore back knocks Woods from Kemper AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the U.S. Open just two weeks away, Tiger
Woods withdrew Monday from the Kemper Open with a sore back and
flew to Las Vegas for treatment.
	   ``His physical therapist advised him that with the U.S. Open
coming up he could aggravate the condition by playing this week and
suggested he come to Las Vegas for treatment,'' said Bev Norwood, a
spokesman for Woods with International Management Group.
	   Las Vegas is also where Woods' coach, Butch Harmon, is based.
	   Woods played last week at the Memorial Tournament in Dublin,
Ohio, finishing 51st. He flew home to Orlando, Florid on Sunday
night.
	   ``This is a precautionary measure to ensure that he is ready and
able to play in the U.S. Open,'' Norwood said.
	   Ben Bundred, Kemper Open tournament chairman, said Woods felt
his back stiffen on the flight from Ohio to Orlando. He said the
pain worsened when Woods hit balls in Orlando on Monday morning.
	   ``He thought nothing of it, went to bed, and this morning when
he went to work out, it hurt worse,'' Bundred said.
	   Bundred added that Woods recently had an MRI on his back and
that his therapist, Keith Kleven, suggested Woods fly to Las Vegas
for treatment of what could be a ``potential chronic problem.''
	   Woods has played in 39 PGA Tour events since turning pro in
1996, and this was the first time he withdrew because of injury. He
pulled out of the 1995 U.S. Open as a amateur after one round
because of a sore wrist.
	   He also withdrew from the Buick Challenge in 1996 because of
exhaustion.
	   ``Tiger has had back pains on and off but his parents have
always assumed they were growing pains,'' Norwood said. ``But the
therapist he has been working with for six months said there was
some irregularities in his lower back.''
	   Woods, 22, has already won seven tournaments, including the 1997
Masters, and nearly dlrs 4 million in less that two years on the
PGA Tour. Tall and lanky, his enormously hard swing clearly puts
strain on his back.
	   The treatment will consist of stretching, back stabilization,
heat and ice, his spokesman said. He said it was not immediately
clear how the injury would affect Woods' practice routine for the
U.S. Open.
	   The U.S. Open will be played June 18-21 at the Olympic Club in
San Francisco, a course Woods knows well from his college career at
Stanford.

New Dutch Antilles government sworn in 
</HEADLINE>
By NORMAN SERPHOS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ After a five-month political
deadlock, a prime minister was sworn in Monday to head a new
government in the Netherlands Antilles.
	   Suzy Camelia-Romer, 38, is the youngest-ever prime minister of
the territory's five Caribbean islands: St. Maarten, St. Eustatius,
Saba, Bonaire and Curacao. Together, the islands are an autonomous
member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
	   Six political parties united to form the new government after
Jan. 30 elections failed to produce a clear winner.
	   The center-right Antillean Restructuring Party won four of 22
parliamentary seats in the elections, more than any other party but
not enough to govern. It was left out of the new coalition.
	   Camelia-Romer, a former justice minister, pledged to erase a
dlrs 70 million budget deficit and increase spending for the Dutch
Antilles Coast Guard, which is charged with stopping drug smugglers
from South America.
	   She and six Cabinet members were sworn in Monday by Gov. Jaime
Saleh in Willemstad.
	   The coalition government includes the Curacao-based Popular
Crusade Labor Party, which won three seats, the National Party of
the People, with two seats, and the May 30 Workers Liberation
Party, also with two seats.
	   It also includes the St. Maarten Democratic Party, with two
seats, the Bonaire Democratic Party with one seat and the Windward
Islands People's Movement from Saba with one seat.
	   Popular Crusade Labor Party leader Errol Cova was named
president of parliament, charged with control over movement of
legislation.

Amid grim days, Couples finds his game AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ There must be times when Fred Couples looks
at Ernie Els, Tiger Woods, David Duval and Justin Leonard and
thinks back to those days when he was considered the best golfer in
the world.
	   In the first five years of this decade _ 1990-94 _ Couples
finished in the top three 25 times in only 99 starts, with eight
victories, including the 1992 Masters.
	   Then it seemed like nothing could go right.
	   From 1995 through '97, Couples had only two top-three finishes
in 48 tournaments and won just once.
	   At times during that stretch it seemed as if life was conspiring
against Couples. A series a personal tragedies made his chronic
back pain seem almost an afterthought.
	   Soon after his Masters victory he went through a very public and
very expensive divorce with his wife of 11 years, Deborah.
	   ``I go to sleep thinking about it and I wake up thinking about
it,'' Couples, an affable and private person, admitted before the
1993 Masters.
	   The next year, his mother Violet died of cancer. And last year,
on Thanksgiving Day, his father Tom died after eight years of
treatment for leukemia.
	   In between, there was an engagement that didn't work out and
then last year his girlfriend, Thais Bren, was diagnosed with
breast cancer.
	   Through it all _ or because of it all _ Couples emerged as a man
more at peace with himself, and perhaps has emerged as a better
golfer that he was even back then when he was the No. 1 ranked
player in the world.
	   ``It's given me a kind of peace,'' Couples said. ``I feel
comfortable with my father. He had a long life and I realize how
lucky I am to be doing what I'm doing. And I have the best girl in
the world.''
	   His golf this year has been as impressive as it was in 1991-92
when he was twice voted the PGA Tour player of the year by his
fellow players.
	   In 11 tournaments in 1998, Couples has finished first twice,
second twice _ including the Masters _ and third once. In his last
five tournaments he has finished second, third, second, 18th and
first, playing 17 of 20 rounds under par.
	   ``I think I'm very capable of playing at 38, 39, 40 as well as I
did when I was 32,'' Couples, 38, said after winning the Memorial
Tournament over the weekend.
	   Clearly, Couples is pleased with what he has achieved this year,
but just as clearly he wants to roll up numbers as good _ or better
_ than those he once achieved.
	   ``I've had a great month, two months, but two months does not
create a whole year of good golf,'' Couples said at Muirfield
Village, where he shot four consecutive rounds in the 60s and hit
32 of 36 greens in the weekend rounds.
	   ``I just had one great year,'' Couples said perhaps too modestly
about his early success. ``And people keep trying to get me back to
that year, and it's not easy to do.''
	   But Couples seems capable of doing it.
	   If not for two bad swings _ one at the Masters and one at the
Byron Nelson _ Couples would be on the verge of a monster year. But
it was a hopeful sign that he was able to put those recent failures
behind him and protect a lead in the final round at the Memorial.
	   His back problems seem under control and he has reduced his
playing and travel schedule in an effort to prolong his career by
reducing the wear and tear on his back.
	   And clearly he has many goals he still wants to achieve.
	   Only Greg Norman and Tom Kite have won more than the dlrs 10.4
million Couples has earned. And another major championship or two
would enhance his standing among the best players of his era.
	   ``Great players have great records,'' Couples said. ``I consider
myself right underneath them, which is fine.''

Belfour: Wings lucky to be up 3-1 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DENNE H. FREEMAN
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Ed Belfour is a tough man to convince. He thinks
the Detroit Red Wings should be thankful for their 3-to-1 edge over
Dallas in the Western Conference finals.
	   ``The last two games we've dominated but they've had a lot of
luck,'' the Dallas goalie said. ``A lot of our shots have hit goal
posts, cross bars, shafts of Chris Osgood's stick. That's just
luck.''
	   The defending champion Red Wings can clinch the best-of-7
Western Conference series with the Stars on Wednesday night in
Reunion Arena.
	   While Belfour believes Detroit is surviving on luck, some of the
blame for back-to-back losses falls directly on the feisty and
defiant Dallas goaltender.
	   Belfour, signed as a free agent last July to provide the big
playoff victories that Andy Moog couldn't produce, was involved in
two plays in Detroit that led to critical goals for the Red Wings.
	   In Game 3, Belfour ventured into the corner to play the puck and
fell after he hit Martin Lapointe. Not drawing a penalty, Belfour
scrambled back into the crease just as Lapointe took a pass and
shot the puck between Belfour's legs. It stopped a Dallas comeback
in an eventual 5-3 Detroit win.
	   On Sunday with Dallas trailing 1-0, Belfour slashed Lapointe and
the Red Wings scored on the ensuing power play.
	   ``I shouldn't have taken that penalty,'' Belfour said. ``That
was a bad penalty to take at that part of the game with Detroit
already leading.''
	   Center Mike Modano, who has scored only one goal against
Detroit, is worried about the Stars getting bad bounces and
starting slowly.
	   ``The last two games have been tough-luck games,'' said Modano,
who hit a post on one of his shots. ``You can pinpoint little
things that aren't going our way.''
	   But he admitted the Stars need to get off to a quick start
Wednesday.
	   ``We keep painting ourselves in the corner at the start of the
game,'' he said. ``We have to come out and control the game early.
We have two days to regroup. We know what we have to do.''
	   The Stars may have to do it with fewer skaters without
defenseman Richard Matvichuk, who was knocked out of Game 4 with a
shoulder injury, and defenseman Shawn Chambers who is out with an
injured knee.

British Prime Minister Blair invited to speak to Irish Parliament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair has
been invited to address the Irish Houses of Parliament, the first
British leader since Ireland won independence in 1921 to receive
such an invitation.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern confirmed the invitation
Monday evening when he met with Blair in the Irish capital to
discuss the Northern Ireland peace process and European Union
business ahead of an EU conference in Cardiff, south Wales, later
this month.
	   Blair said he would be ``honored and privileged'' to speak to
the parliament.
	   ``I believe a new era in UK-Irish relations is opening up,''
Blair said.
	   Previous world leaders to have spoken to lawmakers from the Dail
and Senate have included U.S. presidents John Kennedy, Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Blair is likely to make his historic address to the Dail and
Senate houses of the parliament in the autumn.

Elway says he'll play another year AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ John Elway is coming back.
	   The quarterback ended four months of speculation on Monday when
he announced he would return for a 16th season with the Broncos.
	   ``The bottom line is I wasn't ready to quit competing,'' Elway
said. ``I've got a lot of years to live in retirement and the last
thing I want to do is pass up the opportunity to play one more year
of football.''
	   The suspense began in January after Elway led Denver to its
first Super Bowl championship in five tries.
	   The victory left him with the choice of ending his career at the
top or returning to defend the title with several personal
milestones within reach.
	   Elway, who will turn 38 on June 28, needs 1,311 passing yards to
join Dan Marino as the only National Football League quarterback to
reach 50,000. He also is 22 touchdowns from 300 and 87 completions
from 4,000.
	   Team owner Pat Bowlen was delighted by the announcement.
	   ``I've got to keep pinching myself here because I've been
waiting and hoping for this announcement for a long time,'' Bowlen
said.
	   In 15 seasons, Elway guided his team to more victories (138)
than any other quarterback in NFL history.
	   He is the only player ever to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for
200 yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91).
	   Famous for improbable late-game comebacks, he had rallied his
team to 44 game-saving drives in his career _ more than any
quarterback ever.
	   He was selected to eight Pro Bowls and was the NFL's Most
Valuable Player in 1987. He affixed his name to 54 Broncos'
regular-season or postseason records.
	   But one goal consistently eluded him. He suffered three
increasingly ugly Super Bowl losses and, at 37, had begun to wonder
if he would get another opportunity.
	   It came on Jan. 25 in San Diego against the defending champion
Green Bay Packers. Despite mediocre statistics, Elway set the tone
by scrambling and diving into two defenders for a first down to set
up a Denver touchdown late in the third quarter.
	   In the closing minutes, Elway accounted for his 45th game-saving
drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Howard Griffith to help set up
Terrell Davis' go-ahead scoring run in the 31-24 victory.
	   ``I know that I've been labeled as the guy who's never been on
the winning Super Bowl team,'' a jubilant Elway said then. ``Boy,
am I glad to get rid of that.''
	   Elway had minor surgery on his throwing shoulder in February,
six months after rupturing a biceps tendon in his shoulder in a
preseason game that was first feared to be career-threatening.
	   To some, that operation was a tipoff Elway was coming back,
although he maintained as recently as Friday that he had not made
up his mind.

Play it again: Jazz and Bulls in finals AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The teams are the same, the MVPs are
different and the home-court advantage doesn't belong to the Bulls
anymore.
	   Chicago and Utah begin their rematch in the National Basketball
Association Finals at the Delta Center on Wednesday night, with
Michael Jordan going after his sixth ring and Karl Malone and John
Stockton looking for their first.
	   The Jazz will be coming off 10 days of rest since sweeping the
Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. It is the
longest layoff in NBA playoff history.
	   ``They're waiting, they're hungry and they feel the pain from
when we beat them last year,'' Jud Buechler said after Chicago
defeated the Indiana Pacers 88-83 Sunday night in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
	   ``We may be a little tired, but our hearts are not tired,''
Jordan said.
	   Therein may lie the key, the one intangible on which this series
may turn. No one has ever doubted the heart and unstoppable will of
Jordan.
	   And then there's Karl Malone. He, too, plays with much heart.
But he is not Jordan.
	   During last year's finals, one significant storyline was the MVP
debate. Malone beat Jordan in the MVP vote and almost seemed
surprised that he would be expected to back up the honor.
	   It was the sort of pressure Jordan routinely thrives on. Malone
didn't.
	   In Game 1, he missed two free throws with 9.2 seconds left that
could have given Utah a three-point lead. Jordan then hit a jumper
at the buzzer for the one-point win. Malone sheepishly admitted
afterward that Jordan is a better player.
	   In Game 5, Malone had as many baskets (one) as air balls in the
fourth quarter, then selfishly refused to commit his sixth foul
when the Jazz needed to stop the clock with less than 10 seconds
left. Scottie Pippen dribbled around Malone, fed Luc Longley for a
dunk and the Bulls went ahead 3-2 in the series.
	   In Game 6, Malone shot 8-for-15 from the line as the Bulls
clinched the championship, 90-86.
	   This year, Malone won't have to justify any awards. But he'll
still be going for the championship that has eluded him through an
otherwise magnificent 13-year career.
	   That goal will be at odds with the Bulls' quest to add to their
jewelry collection before they go their separate ways.
	   Coach Phil Jackson has been calling these playoffs the ``Last
Dance,'' with the expectation the Bulls will be broken up at after
the season despite chairman Jerry Reinsdorf's stated inclination to
offer everyone one-year contracts if the team wins a championship.
	   It's another similarity to last year's finals, when Jackson was
using his off days to interview for coaching jobs.
	   Even so, the felling of an impending breakup has been stronger
this spring. Practically the entire team will be free agents this
summer.
	   Scottie Pippen has wanted a megacontract for years, and his
dissatisfaction with Bulls management appears irreparable.
	   Jordan has mulled retiring, and the All-Star game and every
Bulls road trip was treated like a farewell tour before he backed
off his earlier stance that he would refuse to play for any coach
but Jackson.
	   Utah and Chicago finished the regular season with 62-20 records.
The Jazz have the home-court advantage because they swept the
two-game season series.

Fortune magazine: Michael Jordan pumps dlrs 10 billion into economy AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER ALAN HARPER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan has had a dlrs 10 billion impact
on the U.S. economy, Fortune magazine estimates.
	   From peddling sneakers, underwear and cologne, Jordan also has
an influence on rising television ratings and gate receipts for
basketball teams, increased sales of National Basketball
Association paraphernalia and a lineup of sports videos and books.
	   The sports business is ``a fundamentally different industry from
the one he came into,'' the magazine quoted the National Basketball
Association's chief marketer, Rick Welts, as saying. ``How you
figure out what he benefited from based on the industry's growth
and what he contributed to the growth of the industry is a question
for the ages.''
	   The stats for Jordan, who begins the 1998 NBA Finals Wednesday
for perhaps the last time, cover a wide range. He was the league's
most valuable player five times and scoring champion 10 times.
	   Since 1990, when the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls took their first
of five championships, television ratings, ticket sales, television
rights fees, NBA retail sales and player salaries have all risen.
	   With help from outside economists, Fortune estimates the Jordan
persona and product line has been worth dlrs 5.2 billion to sneaker
and sports apparel manufacturer Nike Inc. Other companies whose
products he endorses got an estimated dlrs 408 million lift.
	   The magazine also credits dlrs 3.1 billion in increased sales of
NBA-licensed caps, shirts, jerseys and related objects since Jordan
entered the league in 1984.
	   Then there's the hundreds of millions more in added NBA
attendance and TV and cable revenue attributed to Jordan's drawing
power, the magazine said in a cover story of its June 22 edition,
which reaches newsstands Tuesday.
	   Jordan's sports videos, which have sold more than 4 million
copies, have generated dlrs 80 million in sales. His movie ``Space
Jam,'' sharing the big screen with Bugs Bunny and other Warner
Bros.' animated pals, brought in dlrs 230 million at the box office
and dlrs 209 million in video sales, the report said.
	   Average NBA salaries have risen from the low six-figures in
1983-84, the season before Jordan's debut, to above dlrs 2.6
million this season.
	   Even Jordan's agent, David Falk, is cashing in. Falk's agency
recently was sold for about dlrs 100 million, and Fortune estimated
half of that represents the ``Jordan Effect.''
	   At the end of the day, Jordan is mystified by it all, Fortune
said.
	   ``I never really envisioned myself having any kind of major
impact on people,'' Jordan told the magazine. ``Even now, when I
see kids wearing my shoes, it's kind of wild. Sometimes I still
feel shocked.''

Jazz are rested and ready for champs AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Well rested and way past ready, the Utah
Jazz finally went through a practice on Monday knowing who their
opponent will be in the National Basketball Association Finals.
	   Now the Jazz realize that if there was ever a time they were
poised to dethrone the Chicago Bulls, it is this year.
	   While the Bulls were sweating through a seven-game Eastern
Conference finals series with Indiana, the Jazz were resting,
waiting, waiting and waiting.
	   Now they've got a weary Chicago team coming into a series where
Utah, not the Bulls, has the home-court advantage in one of the
loudest buildings in the NBA.
	   ``In the back of all our minds, it's got to be _ this is the
year,'' Utah's Greg Foster said. ``We've played great. We put
ourselves in a position that we always wanted to be in. So there's
no excuses. If we go out there and blow it, we blow it.''
	   And the finals are no mystery to the Jazz this time. A year ago,
Utah was in uncharted territory against Chicago, but still played
the Bulls tough before losing in six games.
	   This year, the Jazz say, they know what to expect.
	   ``We know that every ball counts for something _ every loose
ball, every rebound,'' Antoine Carr said. ``You've got to get all
the little things done. If you get all the little things done,
everything else will take care of itself.''
	   But don't try to convince the Jazz that they are the favorites.
Not against the Bulls, not against Michael Jordan.
	   ``They're the championship team,'' coach Jerry Sloan said.
``They're the guys who know how to win, and have won, championship
games. Until you beat them, they're still the champions.''
	   Karl Malone said he heard Chicago's Jud Buechler say the Bulls
were underdogs.
	   ``Yeah, right,'' Malone said. ``Maybe if we were a younger team,
they would have gotten us on that, but we're not going to listen to
it.''
	   Foster said he's trying not to notice how many people are
picking Utah to end the Jordan dynasty.
	   ``That just puts unneeded pressure on us,'' Foster said. ``I
still feel that we're in a situation where we have everything to
gain and nothing to lose. They're the team that if the Jazz win,
it's `Oh man, what happened to the Bulls?' I still think we're the
rabbit going after the hunter, as Charles Barkley would say.''
	   Last year's loss to the Bulls is no added motivation, Jeff
Hornacek said.
	   ``We're not the type of team that worries about revenge,'' he
said. ``As Jerry would say, that's playing in the past. Our goal is
to try to win the championship this year and really forget about
last year.''
	   By the time Game 1 tips off on Wednesday night, the Jazz will
have been idle for 10 days since they completed their four-game
sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals.
It's the second-longest layoff in NBA history. Only the Lakers'
12-day respite between the conference finals and NBA Finals in 1982
was longer.

Capitals can wrap up first-ever trip to finals AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Washington Capitals, the oldest National
Hockey League team never to reach the Stanley Cup finals, are
tantalizingly close to getting there.
	   On Monday, for the first time in the franchise's 24-year
history, the Caps donned skates and pads in their practice
facility's locker room and sent pucks flying off the boards in the
month of June. With a 3-1 series lead over the Buffalo Sabres, a
victory Tuesday night is all that's needed to smother the memories
of years of mediocre seasons and first-round playoff flops.
	   ``I've never got this far,'' said seven-year center Joe Juneau,
who scored the winning goal in Saturday's 2-0 Game 4 victory in
Buffalo. ``It's a great feeling to have a chance to be in the show.
We all know what's waiting for us, and I don't think anybody's
going to relax yet.''
	   The Capitals are to the point where the one-game-at-a-time
cliche has become intertwined with the team's unprecedented
success. The locker room clipboard that had 16 sheets on it at the
start of the playoffs has been stripped down to sheet No. 5 _ as in
five games to go to win the Stanley Cup _ and coach Ron Wilson said
he doesn't mind his players thinking ahead to the glory of playing
in the finals.
	   ``I think it's good to look at that because it motivates you to
get the job done,'' Wilson said. ``We've put ourselves in a very
good position with three games to win one. We'd obviously like to
get it done at home.''
	   By no means are the Capitals writing off the Sabres. After all,
if goaltender Dominik Hasek can beat the United States, Canada and
Russia in consecutive games to win an Olympic gold medal with the
Czech Republic, then he certainly can lead the Sabres back from a
3-1 deficit.
	   ``Their confidence is probably shaken a little bit,'' Wilson
said. ``But I don't think anybody outside of their locker room
feels they can come back, so that takes away some of the pressure.
They're a young team. They're going to play with desperation
because they realize that if they lose another game, they're
finished. We have to match their desperation with a sense of
urgency.
	   The Caps have been in this position twice already in the
playoffs, putting away Boston in six games and Ottawa in five after
taking 3-1 leads. Those were liberating victories because of
Washington's history of blowing 3-1 leads _ it's happened three
times in the last 11 years _ and Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff and his
players are hoping to revive the hex one more time.
	   ``We've got them right where we want them,'' forward Dixon Ward
said. ``We set them up perfectly for this situation. Everything is
going as planned. Now all we have to do is win three in a row.''

Report: Australia to become worst greenhouse gas emitter 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will be the world's worst
per capita greenhouse gases polluter within 12 years, a report
released Monday found.
	   Australia was one of only three developed countries which won
approval at the international conference on global warming in
Kyoto, Japan, last December to increase greenhouse gas emissions by
2010.
	   The outcome was hailed by the federal government as a major
victory for Australian industry, but an analysis of the Kyoto
agreement by the liberal think-tank the Australia Institute said
the victory may be at huge environmental cost.
	   The institute's report says Australia's per capita emissions
from energy consumption and industrial uses will rise from 21
(metric) tons per head to 26 tons in 2010, making Australia easily
the world's biggest greenhouse gas polluter.
	   Institute Executive Director Clive Hamilton said Australia had
tricked the rest of the world into giving it special treatment and
had seriously jeopardized attempts to involve developing nations in
future climate change agreements.
	   ``If they had been aware of the facts, other nations would not
have agreed to Australia's demand for an increase in emissions but
would have required us to cut our emissions by more than other
countries,'' Hamilton said.

Travelers Group takes 25 percent stake in top Japanese brokerage 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout and tightens

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Travelers Group Inc. is buying a quarter of Nikko
Securities Co., the third-largest Japanese brokerage house,
expanding its worldwide presence and placing a dlrs 1.6 billion bet
on Japan's financial future.
	   The American financial behemoth joins a growing number of
foreign firms, including securities rival Merrill Lynch and Co.,
that are strengthening their position here.
	   With the Japanese government loosening regulations and scandals
tarnishing the image of domestic brokers, foreign firms are gaining
unprecedented opportunities in one of the world's biggest financial
markets.
	   Monday's deal comes less than a month after Travelers unveiled
an dlrs 82 billion merger with Citicorp to create the world's
largest financial services company. The partnership with Nikko will
enhance the global businesses of both companies.
	   ``Our creating a partnership with Nikko will allow us to be more
productive not only in this marketplace but all around the world,''
Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of Travelers
Group, said at a press conference in Tokyo.
	   New York-based Travelers will become Nikko's biggest
shareholder, taking over from top Japanese lender Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. Nikko will buy a smaller stake in Travelers
Group to solidify the broad-based tie-up.
	   The deal is one of the most aggressive moves to date by an
American financial firm in Japan amidst a major effort to
liberalize the Japanese financial industry by 2001. The reforms,
dubbed the ``Big Bang,'' are expected to open up a pool of personal
financial assets worth an estimated dlrs 9 trillion.
	   A number of other big names on Wall Street have also expanded in
Japan. In February, Merrill Lynch and Co. hired 2,100 former
employees of the failed Yamaichi Securities Co. to staff 33 retail
outlets nationwide. Fidelity Investments Co. has announced similar
plans.
	   The foreign firms hope to generate big business by persuading
Japanese consumers to shift the bulk of their assets from
low-yielding savings accounts and by winning support from the
public because of the financial problems and other scandals
plaguing domestic companies.
	   As part of their strategic alliance, Travelers and Nikko plan to
link their worldwide securities sales and trading businesses. They
will also set up a jointly-owned Tokyo-based securities company
with working capital of more than 140 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion).
	   The Japanese venture, to be called Nikko Salomon Smith Barney
Ltd., will incorporate the investment banking, consumer product and
research operations of Nikko Securities, one of Japan's ``Big
Three'' brokers.
	   Masashi Kaneko, president of Nikko Securities, said that he does
not expect the tie-up will trigger a drastic job cuts or branch
closures in the immediate future.
	   The venture will be headed by Yuji Shirakawa, currently
president of Nikko Research Center. Toshiharu Kojima, chief
executive of Salomon Smith Barney in Japan, will become co-chief
executive of the venture, along with a Nikko Securities official.
	   Investors reacted positively to the news. Nikko Securities
shares rose 11 percent in Tokyo to close at 482 yen (dlrs 3.46).
Travelers shares rose dlrs 1.75, or 3 percent, to close at dlrs 63
on the New York Stock Exchange.
	   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange launched an investigation
Monday over possible insider trading involving Nikko shares after
the price of its stock jumped Friday, an exchange official said.
	   Nikko shares closed at 436 yen (dlrs 3.16) Friday, up 4.8
percent from Thursday's close. At one point during trading Friday,
the shares rose as much as 10 percent. A total of 8.59 million
Nikko shares were traded, about 5.9 times the amount traded on
Thursday.
	   Both Travelers and Nikko denied any involvement in insider
trading.

Thousands of refugees flee fighting in Kosovo; dozens reported dead,0620

RETRANSMITTING to fix slug

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees from Serbia's
Kosovo province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to
escape some of the deadliest fighting in months. Dozens of people
were reported killed.
	   Albania appealed to the United States and European Union to
intervene in what it said was a ``massacre'' in Kosovo.
	   ``This is just the start of a war with tragic dimensions,'' the
Albanian government said in a statement.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the bloodshed appeared the worst since
March, when Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on militants among the ethnic Albanian majority in
Serb-ruled Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard spoke of ``heavy and
indiscriminate shelling'' of villages near the border with Albania.
He said U.N. workers could see heavy mortars being fired into the
villages.
	   Refugees said a 3-year-old child died en route to Albania.
	   Ethnic Albanian officials said 37 Albanians were killed over the
weekend. Twenty-seven died in clashes in Decani while 10 were
killed when Serb police stormed a village elsewhere, they said.
	   Two Serb policemen also died in the fighting around Decani, 45
miles west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Serb sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The fierce fighting forced about 2,000 Kosovo Albanians _ mostly
women, children and the elderly _ across the border into Albania's
Tropoja (pronounced Tro-POH-yah) region on Sunday and Monday,
Albania said. They said more were arriving by the hour.
	   In Tropoja, some refugees said they had walked for up to 20
hours to reach the Albanian town. They said Serb tanks were
positioned inside Decani, and that Serb forces were besieging the
town.
	   Tropoja, although some three miles inside Albanian territory,
resembled a community under siege, with most of the men carrying
rifles or other weapons. Some men displayed the insignia of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the militant Kosovo organization
spearheading the fight against Serbia.
	   Andrew Harper, a U.N. aid worker, said he purchased three tons
of flour, rice and other basics on the local market to provide for
the refugees, and more aid was expected from Tirana, the Albanian
capital, on Tuesday.
	   ``I am very worried about providing for all these people,'' said
Isa Memia, the town leader. ``We have grave (supply) problems
ourselves, but they are our kinsmen, and we will help them.''
	   Authorities in Serbia are using Serbian police and the Yugoslav
army to try to crush militants and maintain control over the
province, where 90 percent of the population of 2.2 million is
ethnic Albanian.
	   The conflict has killed more than 200 people in Kosovo since the
beginning of March. About half of the province is believed
controlled by militant Albanians and many regions are blocked off,
either by Serbs or Albanians.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, released the names of the 10 people it said were killed
Sunday when Serb police stormed the village of Poklek, 15 miles
west of Pristina. It said one had had his throat slit.
	   According to the ethnic Albanians' account, Serb police burst
into Poklek houses, pulled out villagers and told them to, ``Go to
Albania and never return.''
	   Afterward, Serb police allegedly set 26 homes ablaze.
	   Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in the
Yugoslav federation.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move
on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks edged higher Monday, but
technology shares took another drubbing as the delay of the new
Intel chip compounded worries about the impact of a weak Asian
economy on computer industry profits. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 22.42 points _ or 0.25 percent _ to 8,922.37 after
retreating from an 81-point advance to within 20 points of 9,000.
Broader indexes fell, with the technology-laden Nasdaq composite
plunging nearly 2 percent as the recent exodus from big
computer-related names picked up steam. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American Home Products Corp., a leading drug and
health care products concern, is buying biotechnology giant
Monsanto Co. for stock valued at about dlrs 33 billion. The deal
announced Monday would create a life sciences behemoth with dlrs 23
billion in annual sales, more financial muscle for research and
marketing and ambitions for getting products out faster in a
fiercely competitive market. American Home Products makes the pain
reliever Advil, Chap Stick lip balm and Robitussin cough syrup as
well as a range of prescription drugs and medical devices. Monsanto
makes ingredients for agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and
foods including the Lasso and Roundup herbicides and the Nutrasweet
sugar substitute. (US-MONSANTO-AMERICAN HOME)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian stocks plunged more than 10 percent Monday
in a frenzy of selling by Russian banks and a cold shoulder from
foreign investors wary of the market's turmoil. The Russian Trading
System index closed 10.2 percent lower after late panic selling
gripped the market and reassuring comments from government
officials failed to calm jittery investors. Monday's close matched
the 10-percent fall last Wednesday, when hectic selling caused the
stock market to plummet and threatened a run on the national
currency, the ruble. The market has fallen 44 percent since the
beginning of May, making it the worst performing market in the
world, and there are fears of further losses before calm is
restored. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ In normal times, an Air France strike would merely
cause havoc. But the walkout by the carrier's pilots Monday was
worse: a deep embarrassment for a country preparing to host in just
nine days the world's biggest sporting event, the World Cup.
Despite pressure from leftist government ministers, most of the
state-run carrier's 3,200 pilots stayed out of their cockpits to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
They are threatening to stay out for two weeks or more. That's well
into the World Cup, which begins June 10 and lasts a month. On just
the first day Monday, 100,000 passengers were sent scrambling. And
it could be only the beginning: French train workers were planning
to strike at the end of the week. (AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The Karachi Stock Market hit a record
low on Monday falling 128.76 points to close at 911.44. ``There was
massive liquidation by foreign investors and this put immense
pressure on the market,'' said Hasan Davar, a trader with UBS
Securities. The Karachi Stock Exchange opened Monday for the first
time since Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices last Thursday and
a sixth one on Saturday, bringing global condemnation and threats
of economic sanctions. Within hours of the first five explosions,
Pakistan's president declared a state of emergency and froze all
foreign currency accounts to try to prevent a panic exodus of
foreign capital from the country. Pakistan's foreign reserves stand
at dlrs 1.2 billion, which is barely enough to pay for the next six
weeks of imports, say financial analysts. (PAKISTAN-STOCK MARKET)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday decided to retain ownership of
51 percent of the national air carrier El Al, despite
recommendations the unprofitable company be sold off. A statement
from the ministerial committee overseeing Israel's privatization
plans quoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying the
decision ``will protect our national interests.'' Israel radio said
national security and emergency situations were key factors in the
decision to retain a majority share of the airline. The decision
ensures that El Al flights will continue to be grounded during the
Jewish Sabbath _ from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown. The
Sabbath groundings have been cited as a factor in the company's
losses. (ISRAEL-EL AL)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of refugees from Serbia's
Kosovo province streamed into neighboring Albania on Monday to
escape some of the deadliest fighting in months. Dozens of people
were reported killed. Albania appealed to the United States and
European Union to intervene. Reports from Serb and Albanian sources
often were contradictory and could not be independently verified.
But with 39 people reported killed over the weekend, and fighting
apparently continuing, the bloodshed appeared the worst since
March, when Serbian police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on militants among the ethnic Albanian majority in
Serb-ruled Kosovo. The latest fighting forced about 2,000 Kosovo
Albanians _ mostly women, children and the elderly _ across the
border into Albania's Tropoja region on Sunday and Monday, Albania
said. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite
nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new
security situation'' on the nearby Asian subcontinent, the defense
minister said in comments published Monday. India tested five
nuclear devices last month, which were followed by six explosions
by neighbor and rival Pakistan. Iran denies repeated U.S. and
Israeli allegations that it is close to building an atom bomb,
saying its nuclear program is peaceful. (IRAN-NUCLEAR)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing increased pressure to clean up
past misdeeds, Indonesia's new government announced a broad-based
inquiry Monday into corruption under ex-President Suharto. However,
it stopped short of meeting demands by student protesters and
others who want the wealth of Suharto and his super-rich family
specifically targeted. Critics say the Suhartos blatantly used
their power and position to amass billions of dollars by dominating
the now ailing economy. Thousands of students staged peaceful
protests in several cities Monday calling for an end to both local
and national graft. (INDONESIA)
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Some hobbled on makeshift crutches,
a few carried stretchers and others broke into a run as helicopters
carrying emergency aid landed Monday in remote northern
Afghanistan, devastated by an earthquake that killed more than
3,000 people. On a small distant hillock, a woman cuddled her
infant, a toddler sat nearby wailing. Crouched behind, her head
buried in a bright orange shawl, a woman sobbed. The quake, which
hit Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, flattened entire
villages, sliced mountains and triggered landslides. The estimates
of the dead vary from 3,000 to 5,000 people. Thousands more were
homeless and missing. Aftershocks lingered in the region Monday,
sending frightened residents scrambling outdoors.
(AFGHANISTAN-QUAKE)
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah arrived Monday
in Jordan for talks aimed at resolving differences between key Arab
leaders on a proposed summit on the Middle East peace process.
Abdullah came from Damascus where he met at least twice with Syrian
President Hafez Assad to persuade him to accept an open agenda at
the proposed summit, Arab diplomats said. Such a demand also has
been made by Jordan and some Gulf nations. But all agree that the

Eds: Contains items on Hitler and potato chips, Jerry Seinfeld,
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency apologized for
using Adolf Hitler's image to sell potato chips in Thailand, and
was talking with the chip-maker Monday over whether to pull the
ads.
	   The TV commercial for ``X'' potato chips shows Hitler giving a
Nazi salute and a shot of a swastika transformed into the ``X''
product logo.
	   Posters for the chips suggest that eating the snacks would
transform even Hitler himself into a fun-loving, likable character.
	   ``The commercial ... is designed to communicate that the world
would be a better place if happiness ruled. It was never intended
to offend and the agency apologizes to anyone who finds it
insensitive,'' the international ad agency, Leo Burnett Bangkok,
said in a statement Sunday, after Israeli diplomats complained.
	   Talks were under way Monday between the agency and the Thai
client, Food Processing Co.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The array of snacks Jerry Seinfeld
reportedly requires backstage is idiosyncratic enough to inspire an
episode of the popular U.S. television show ``Seinfeld.''
	   The superstar comedian is scheduled to do eight live shows in
Australia this month, but only if he gets certain foods, according
to The Daily Telegraph.
	   The paper quotes an unnamed promoter as saying Seinfeld's
``essential backstage items'' include: 18 small bottles of water on
ice (any brand except Evian is fine), one bag of Rold Gold
pretzels, one vegetable tray for four people, one small jar of
mayonnaise, and a small amount of pasta salad _ hold the
mayonnaise.
	   ``By superstar standards, it's not that demanding a list,'' the
promoter told the Telegraph.
	   ___
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Mark Lenney now owns a little piece of
Mars.
	   The engineer from Santa Clara, California, shelled out dlrs 700
for a Mars rock at an auction on Sunday that included dinosaur
bones, rare gems, minerals and several meteorites.
	   ``It was reasonably priced,'' said Lenney, who added that the
mystery of the universe propelled him to his first auction ``to be
in touch with the wonder of it all.''
	   Lenney also picked up a dlrs 450 slice of meteorite created at
the dawn of our solar system and a dlrs 325 rock from a 1969 meteor
shower that contains dozens of amino acids, the building blocks of
proteins.
	   The biggest seller at the auction was a 995-pound (450-kilo)
boulder that was part of a vast meteorite shower that fell on the
edge of the Kalahari Desert thousands of years ago. It sold for a
whopping dlrs 101,500.
	   Not to be outdone by more experienced collectors, 9-year-old
Caleb Kauffman of San Francisco won the bidding for a sample of
Sikholite-Alin meteorite, an iron specimen that fell on Siberia in
1947.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was all over the tabloids Monday, and the
quality papers, too. Questions were asked in the House of Commons:
Geri Spice is out. So's Gazza.
	   Geri Halliwell, 25, was the eldest member of the Spice Girls,
the inventor of ``girl power,'' the gorgeous pouting idol of
millions of pre-adolescent girls. She quit after a series of fights
with the other four members of the group _ and after earning a
reported dlrs 20 million in two years.
	   Paul Gascoigne, 31, was a sometimes brilliant soccer player who
won the nation's heart with his tears when he was ejected from the
1990 World Cup. But the nation often had to think again: Gazza
drunk, Gazza posing at a urinal on his wedding day, Gazza's wife
walking out of the marriage with a bruised face.
	   England manager Glen Hoddle dropped Gascoigne from the World Cup
squad because of his poor physicial condition.
	   In the House of Commons, Labor lawmaker Gareth Thomas urged the
government to encourage Geri ``to think again.''
	   Conservative lawmaker Anne McIntosh managed to work Gascoigne
sad situation into a discussion of the ``social exclusion'' of
Britain's down and out.
	   ``I wonder if you would like to comment on the impact on the
England football team of excluding Gazza from the squad?'' she
said, drawing laughter from her colleagues.
	   ___
	   WEST HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ The mayor has pulled the plug on
a flashing sign that warned people to keep quiet at the beach. It
was too loud.
	   The sign was turned on for the first time Friday, then
disconnected a few hours later because the generator used to power
it made enough noise to defeat the sign's purpose, said Mayor H.
Richard Borer Jr.
	   ``It wasn't that loud, but it was a generator,'' Borer said
Sunday. ``It makes noise.''
	   The sign stands about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground flashes
a warning advising motorists driving into the city that the
beachfront road is a quiet zone.
	   Town workers may connect the sign to a nearby electrical outlet
for a quieter power source, the mayor said.

Britain's state prosecution agency faces major shake-up, government says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government has said it will back proposals for
a shake-up of Britain's public prosecution organization _ which
would include the introduction of American-style district attorneys
_ in an effort to stop so many serious cases being dropped before
they get to court.
	   A damming report on the 12-year-old Crown Prosecution Service
issued Monday said it was too bureaucratic and centralized to do
its job, with lawyers spending too much time on paperwork and not
enough fighting cases.
	   ``Our assessment of the CPS is that it has the potential to
become a lively, successful and esteemed part of the criminal
justice system, but that, sadly, none of these adjectives applied
to the service as a whole at present,'' the report, written by
former judge Sir Iain Glidewell, said.
	   Glidewell said that prosecutors failed to pursue one in eight
cases, and that about a quarter of people charged with more serious
offenses had their prosecutions dropped.
	   In contrast, only 1 in 100 motoring offenses was dropped by the
CPS, the report said.
	   The service's critics, including police officers, say that has
happened because the service's lawyers prefer to pursue easy-to-win
cases and engage in plea-bargaining in more serious cases to avoid
the expense of going to court.
	   The report made 75 recommendations, including the establishing
of 42 new Chief Crown Prosecutors, one for each police force area
in England and Wales, which British newspapers reported Tuesday
would be modeled on the U.S. system of district attorneys. Scotland
has its own state prosecuting service.
	   ``The Government accepts the thrust of the report's proposals
for reordering CPS priorities to focus more on the core business of
prosecuting, greater separation of management from legal work,
greater autonomy for the areas, and better prospects for the
staff,'' Attorney General John Morris told the House of Commons on
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican separatist group
responsible for bombings in the 1970s and 1980s on Monday promised
to fight to prevent the sale of the public telephone utility to GTE
Corp. and other investors.
	   ``The sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company is nothing more
than a declaration of war,'' the People's Boricua Army said in a
letter sent to the Associated Press. ``Now they will know what war
is.'
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello announced a dlrs 1.9 billion deal last week
to sell part of the telephone company to investors and give GTE
control over management. The sale must be approved by the Puerto
Rican legislature.
	   The guerrilla group is also known as the Macheteros, or
``cane-cutters.'' Founded in 1978, it claimed responsibility for
several bombings and other attacks on U.S. government installations
through the early 1980s.
	   ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A bomb exploded outside
the headquarters of the Dominican Republic's main anti-drug agency
early Monday, leaving a bucket-sized crater in the pavement but
causing no injuries.
	   Explosives experts took samples from the site Monday morning in
Santo Domingo, but nobody was immediately arrested.
	   The blast came days after a visit to Santo Domingo by Barry
McCaffrey, U.S. drug policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. The
explosion also followed cocaine seizures totaling 1,980 pounds (900
kilos). The cocaine was believed to have come from the Cali Cartel
in Colombia.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ A major drug trafficking suspect who
was the focus of a political scandal in Panama has been extradited
to Florida, officials said Monday.
	   In a radio interview, Interior Minister Raul Montenegro said
Castrillon Henao, a Colombian, was flown to Florida on Sunday,
where he was also wanted on money laundering charges.
	   Local newspapers reported that Jose Castrillon Henao had
contributed to the 1994 campaign of President Ernesto Perez
Balladares. The president denied knowledge and vowed to tighten
rules on campaign financing and against money laundering.
	   Police arrested Castrillon Henao in April 1996, accusing him of
being head of the Cali drug cartel's operations in Panama.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian drug stores saw brisk
sales of Viagra on Monday, the first day the anti-impotency drug
was legally sold in the country.
	   Pharmacies that had not yet received the drug reported waiting
lists with as many of 40 names. Several others had opened telephone
hot lines for home delivery of the drug.
	   By early afternoon, Gilberto Silvany, a Rio pharmacist, reported
his store had already sold out 80 percent of its stock.
	   ``I think we'd probably sell more but a lot of people are too
embarrassed to ask for a drug that affects them down there,''
Silvany said.
	   Although Monday marks the first day that Viagra was sold legally
in Brazil, it has been available for some time on the black market
for as much dlrs 22 a pill. In the drug stores, the drug sells for
about dlrs 48 for a box of four pills.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexicans continue to hold a generally
favorable image of President Ernesto Zedillo, despite skepticism
about the success of key policies, according to a poll published
Monday by the daily Reforma.
	   Asked the rate the president on a scale of one to 10, those
polled gave Zedillo an average rating of 6.4, down from 6.5 in
March and 6.7 in December, but higher than the ratings in his first
two years after taking office in December 1994.
	   The poll found that 54 percent approved of Zedillo's
performance, down from 59 percent in September 1997, while 39
percent disapproved, up from 32 percent in September.
	   However those polled overwhelmingly said the government had
achieved little success in halting corruption, solving the
rebellion in Chiapas, improving the economy, attacking pollution or
fighting drug trafficking.
	   Reforma said its polling unit surveyed 1,190 adults across
Mexico in late May. It gave a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Bandits blocked the road from Acapulco to
Zihuatanejo and robbed passengers aboard a luxury tourist bus of
more than dlrs 2,200, newspapers reported Monday.
	   The daily Reforma reported that one of the passengers, Isolina
Sanchez, was shot in the thigh during the incident and was being
treated at a hospital.
	   Federal Highway Police told Reforma that the incident occurred
at 3:30 a.m. Saturday on the outskirts of Acapulco.
	   Six heavily armed men blocked the highway and forced the driver
to leave the road. Passengers were then robbed of their belongings.

Explosion destroys three buses near Tokyo airport, no injuries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pre-dawn explosion Tuesday at a bus depot just
outside Tokyo destroyed three buses, two of which were used for
shuttling passengers to Tokyo's main international airport, a
police spokesman said.
	   Atsushi Henmi of the Chiba Prefectural, or State, Police, said
the explosion occurred in the bus depot at the Matsudo office of
Keisei Electric Railway's motor vehicle department at around 3:30
a.m. (1830 GMT Monday).
	   The explosion set two limousine buses and one regular passenger
bus in the depot on fire, destroying them, Henmi said. There were
five bus company employees on night at the time of the explosion,
but none was hurt, Henmi said.
	   Police suspect anti-airport radicals may have been involved in
the explosion as fragments of lead cables and batteries were found
near the explosion site.
	   The airport at Narita, 65 kilometers (40 miles), east of Tokyo,
opened in 1978 with a single runway.
	   Left-wing activists, opposed to the expansion of the airport,
claim that the government has planned to use the airport for
military purposes.
	   In April, a pre-dawn explosion damaged the home of an official
at the airport, while in February the ultra-leftist Revolutionary
Workers Association claimed responsibility for three homemade
rockets fired into a cargo plane area at Narita airport.
	   One airport worker was injured in that attack, which came as
athletes and other officials were arriving at the airport for the
Winter Olympic Games in Nagano.

Can Venus and Hingis be the next Chris and Martina? 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Could there be, finally, a rivalry to match Evert
vs. Navratilova? Surely that's what the tennis world hopes.
	   Not so fast, says Martina Hingis. She isn't ready to call Venus
Williams a true rival yet.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
says. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   ``I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   True. But Williams is playing so well at this year's French Open
that their match Tuesday is the most anticipated of the tournament.
	   Hingis and Williams will meet in the quarterfinals, but many see
it as worthy of the final.
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically to Hingis' comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, including a 6-0, 6-4
win in the final of the U.S. Open last summer in their only
previous Grand Slam meeting.
	   They are 2-2 this year. But Hingis won their only career
encounter on clay, the final of the Italian Open in May.
	   ``It was a good victory for me there,'' Hingis said. ``I hope
she will remember that, too.''
	   Statistically speaking, the two have had an almost identical run
through the early rounds here. Hingis has lost just 14 games while
averaging 56 minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and
averaged 58 minutes per match.
	   But stylistically speaking, they are totally different.
	   Hingis has a masterful touch, moving opponents around the court
with precise groundstrokes. Williams is pure power.
	   Power is what Marat Safin has, in spades. The 18-year-old
qualifier stormed his way through the first three rounds, but lost
in the fourth Monday, in five tough sets.
	   The French fans chanted wildly for his opponent, Frenchman
Cedric Pioline. ``Allez Cedric!'' they yelled.
	   But as the match wore on, there were growing chants of ``Ma-RAT!
Ma-RAT!''
	   It was in tribute to the remarkable run by the young Russian
playing his first Grand Slam event. He began the tournament ranked
116th, but won't be there much longer.
	   ``I think I can beat good players now,'' he said after Pioline
ended his run, 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Safin's tournament started with three qualifying matches just to
get into the main draw.
	   Next up was Andre Agassi. With the American star hot on a
comeback, Safin wasn't given a chance. But he thwarted the
comeback, and then ousted defending champion Gustavo Kuerten,
ranked eighth in the world, in another five-setter.
	   In the third round, Safin, by now the story of the tournament,
had a slightly easier time _ a four-setter over Daniel Vacek of the
Czech Republic.
	   That set up the match with Pioline. The 28-year-old Frenchman is
erratic, but brilliant on occasion. He's reached the finals of
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, both times losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Pioline has a reputation for choking at the end of matches. He's
reached 12 finals but has only two singles titles.
	   Safin knew nothing of that.
	   ``Nobody told me,'' he said.
	   It didn't matter. This time, Safin unraveled. Pioline broke
serve three times, including once in the fifth set. That was
enough.
	   Safin said he wasn't thrown by the 16,000 or so fans at Roland
Garros shouting for Pioline.
	   However, the presence of soccer star Ronaldo in the VIP box was
another matter. Asked if he'd been distracted by the Brazilian, in
town for the World Cup, Safin thought for a moment, then announced:
``Yes.''
	   ``I'd never seen Ronaldo so close up before,'' he explained.
	   Then again, maybe it was the presence next to Ronaldo of Anna
Kournikova, the blonde Russian teenager who also lost Monday.
	   ``She's so beautiful, unbelievable,'' Safin said.
	   Whatever the reason, Safin said he'd learned a lesson on center
court.
	   ``You have to be a little bit clever on the important points,''
he said. ``You can't lose your serve when you are 5-3 up.''
	   Olga Morozova, the former Russian champion, played with Safin's
mother, Rauza. She said Safin was the new great hope for Russian
tennis.
	   ``It's really quite unbelievable, what he did here,'' she said.
	   Safin himself was more down to earth. What makes him happy is
that he broke into the top 100 this week.

Rugova calls for greater UN role, independence for Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With violence escalating in Kosovo, the
head of the self-declared government of the Kosovo Albanians is
calling for an international civilian administration for the
Serb-ruled province as a first step toward independence.
	   ``The independence of Kosovo is the best solution,'' Ibrahim
Rugova told reporters Monday after meeting Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. He said he asked Annan for ``more support for Kosovo'' and
unspecified ``preventive measures'' to prevent further
deterioration and ``massacres and massive ethnic cleansing.''
	   Rugova said independence for Kosovo, which has a 90 percent
majority Albanian population, would help stabilize ``even Serbia,
although at this stage they think in a different way.''
	   Serbia rejects independence and considers Kosovo the cradle of
Serb culture. The United States and other major countries also
oppose independence but have called for self-rule for the Kosovo
Albanians within Serbian borders.
	   But Rugova said an independent Kosovo could guarantee the safety
of Serbs living within its borders. Pending independence, he
suggested creation of ``some kind of international civilian
administration, or a protectorate, as an interim measure.''
	   He also called for an end to Serb military and police operations
against Albanian separatists who have been fighting for
independence for the Albanian-majority region, which is now a
province of Serbia. Serbia, together with Montenegro, forms
Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova arrived in New York after a visit to Washington in which
he conferred with President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   His visit coincided with a sharp escalation of violence in the
troubled province. Thousands of refugees streamed Monday into
neighboring Albania to escape some of the deadliest fighting in
months. Dozens of people were reported killed.
	   Albania appealed to the United States and European Union to
intervene in what it said was a ``massacre'' in Kosovo. ``This is
just the start of a war with tragic dimensions,'' the Albanian
government said in a statement.
	   The bloodshed appeared the worst since March, when Serb police
killed more than 80 people in a crackdown on militants among the
ethnic Albanian majority.
	   On Monday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said 1,300 people arrived
Sunday at the Albanian border town of Tropoja, the largest number
in a single day. Eckhard said an undetermined number of others were
believed trapped by the fighting and unable to cross the border.
	   During the press conference, Rugova applauded U.S. mediation to
promote a dialogue between the Kosovo Albanians and President
Slobodan Milosevic. Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
	   ``In order for the negotiations to be successful, it is critical
that police and military operations stop,'' Rugova said. ``Serb
police and military actions have been continuing, resulting in many
people killed.''

Nomo's career with Dodgers over AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Nomomania'' came to a shocking, abrupt end
in Los Angeles.
	   Hideo Nomo, who brought thousands of Japanese fans to major
league baseball after joining the Dodgers in 1995, was cut loose by
the team Monday.
	   The Dodgers designated Nomo for assignment, removing him from
the team's 40-man roster immediately. They have 10 days to either
trade or assign the 29-year-old right-hander, or seven days to
place him on unconditional release waivers.
	   The decision marked another major move since the Fox Group
purchased the Dodgers from the O'Malley family 2 1/2 months ago.
	   Catcher Mike Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile were traded to
the Florida Marlins on May 15 for outfielders Gary Sheffield and
Jim Eisenreich, third baseman Bobby Bonilla, catcher Charles
Johnson and a minor league pitcher.
	   And last week, the Dodgers were reportedly close to acquiring
left-hander Randy Johnson from Seattle. Nomo's name was mentioned
prominently, and agent Don Nomura said at a Dodger Stadium news
conference Monday those rumors caused his client to want to leave
Los Angeles.
	   Nomo's popularity among Asian fans was similar to the kind of
fan support _ ``Fernandomania'' _ received in the Mexican community
after the emergence of left-hander Fernando Valenzuela, who pitched
for the Dodgers from 1980-90.
	   Nomura met with Dodgers general manager Fred Claire on Sunday
and requested a move be made. A day earlier, Nomo was booed during
a 7-3 loss to Cincinnati in which he allowed seven hits and six
runs in 3 2-3 innings.
	   Afterward, manager Bill Russell said, ``Today was the fastball,
it just wasn't there. We're told that he's healthy, but he's not
the same.''
	   Nomo, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow
last fall, was just 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA, although he struck out 73
in 67 2-3 innings and pitched two complete games.
	   He lost his last four decisions, allowing 18 earned runs in 26
2-3 innings.
	   ``Hideo had expressed the thought that it would be best to make
a move,'' Claire said. ``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps
all teams. There is a time frame. That being said, there is also a
great demand for pitching. Hideo is an outstanding pitcher.''
	   Nomo said little at the news conference. But, through an
interpreter, he said it was true he ``definitely needed a change of
scenery, a change of environment.''
	   ``I'm truly grateful for everything the Dodgers did provide me,
with an opportunity to fulfill a dream,'' he said.
	   Nomo is signed through the end of the season and is earning dlrs
2.7 million this year _ his fourth in the major leagues.
	   Nomo was the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year, and recorded 500
strikeouts faster than any other pitcher in major league history,
accomplishing the feat in 444 2-3 innings. He was 13-6 with a 2.54
ERA and 236 strikeouts in 1995; 16-11 with a 3.19 ERA and 234
strikeouts in 1996, and 14-12 with a 4.25 ERA and 233 strikeouts
last year.
	   When asked if Monday's move meant Nomo's career with the Dodgers
was definitely finished, Claire said, ``That is safe to say. It's
not a move you can turn back from.''

Dollar higher, stocks bounce back moderately in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher in early trading Tuesday
from its levels late in Tokyo on Monday, though off record highs
reached overnight in New York. Tokyo stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 139.42 yen in early trading, up 0.30 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo. In New York overnight, the dollar settled at
139.70 yen, its highest closing level since June 24, 1991, when it
reached 139.82 yen.
	   Traders said the dollar's retreat from its New York level came
on profit-taking after a Japanese newspaper said Tuesday that
officials from the major industrialized nations may meet as early
as this week to discuss the weakness of the yen.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, quoting unnamed international sources,
said the deputies of the Group of Seven major nations may hold a
meeting to stem the yen's slide.
	   Japan's Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, meanwhile, expressed
renewed concern about the current level of the yen against the
dollar.
	   ``In any case, I have strong concern about an excessively weak
yen, and we will take appropriate and decisive action against it,''
Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   On the stock market, sentiment improved slightly after Monday's
announcement that Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese brokerage,
and Travelers Group of the United States were planning an equity
tie-up.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 125.82
points, or 0.82 percent, to 15,446.85 in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Monday, the index had lost 349.75 points, or 2.23
percent.
	   ``The market welcomed Nikko's alliance, as it will likely
trigger more Japanese financial institutions' tie-ups with foreign
institutions,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities.
	   Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy had
triggered Monday's fall.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.27 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,202.97. The
TOPIX fell 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.165 percent from Monday's record low
finish of 1.155 percent, driving its price down to 112.33 yen from
112.41 yen.

Talks set Tuesday, but can pilots be enticed to return to skies?

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France, the official World Cup carrier, moved
into its second day of a strike Tuesday, setting talks to find
common ground with angry pilots and save face ahead of the soccer
championships next week.
	   The strike caused chaos for almost 100,000 passengers on its
first day Monday, worries for fans and teams attending the
month-long World Cup starting June 10 and embarrassment for all.
	   The state-run carrier's main pilots' union called the 15-day
action to protest against 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in
annual pay cuts. Most of the 3,200 Air France pilots did not work
Monday.
	   Departure screens at airports around the nation flashed the bad
news: ``annule'' and ``canceled'' next to list upon list of
flights. Air France planes, many decorated with giant paintings of
soccer players representing the 32 competing teams, sat idle.
	   Air France predicted a slight improvement in traffic Tuesday
with 15 percent of long-haul flights taking off, compared to 10
percent Monday, and up to 35 percent of short- and medium-haul
flights scheduled.
	   ``I think that all the French without exception, and naturally
the pilots ... hope the (World Cup) will be a great fete, a great
fete for world soccer and a great fete for France,'' said the
airline's president, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, in a television interview
Monday night.
	   ``And I don't see who would take responsibility to wreck this
great fete by a strike which can't be understood.''
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France, and the company has said if the
strike continues it will probably use outside carriers to enable it
to meet its obligations.
	   Spinetta appeared to be counting in part on World Cup ardor to
convince pilots to return to the cockpit in talks set for 3:30 p.m
(1330 GMT) Tuesday -- the first since failed 11th hour talks last
Thursday.
	   But he gave no hint that Air France, which almost went bankrupt
in 1993, was ready to withdraw its controversial plan to cut
pilots' salaries in exchange for shares in Air France.
	   Pilots also want Air France to do away with salary cuts for
starting pilots, a system in force for the past year.
	   Nicolas Minvelle, waiting at Charles de Gaulle Airport for a
flight to Senegal, said it wasn't fair the pilots were striking
just before the World Cup.
	   ``They use an international event to bother everyone. It's too
bad,'' he said.
	   The airports in Lyon and Marseille, France's second and
third-largest cities, were virtually deserted. Rental car agencies
did brisk business.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is sending the U.S. team on an American Airlines flight to Paris
that connects to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses for all their travel plans in France.
	   ``After the draw, everyone was scared,'' federation president
Alan Rothenberg said Monday. ``We've gone out and spent to set up
our own system ... to take care of ourselves.''
	   Passengers ``are being taken hostage,'' the French passenger
association ADUA said in a statement. It called the walkout by the
pilots, among the highest-paid in the world, ``a strike by the
privileged of the skies.''
	   Air France pilots earn around 60,000 francs (dlrs10,000) per
month, 20 to 30 percent more than pilots from other European
countries.
	   The walkout would be Air France's longest in 27 years if it
lasts the projected two weeks.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main union, the SNPL,
admitted Monday the strike's consequences were ``disastrous.''
	   ``But when you're confronted by an attack you have no choice but
to defend yourself,'' he told French television.

Iran: Muslims worldwide welcome Pakistani nuclear tests With US-Pakistan-India, Arabs-Nuclear Tests 
</HEADLINE>

By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister praised
Pakistan for its nuclear tests _ offering some solace amid
near-worldwide disapproval.
	   Muslims in the Middle East long had worried about Israel's
nuclear capability, said Kamal Kharrazi, the first foreign
dignitary to visit Pakistan since the blasts occurred. ``Now, they
feel confident,'' because a fellow Islamic nation possesses the
know-how to build nuclear weapons, he said.
	   Other Islamic nations expressed concern about the nuclear arms
race between Pakistan and India, citing the threat to peace.
	   In New Delhi on Monday, India announced an increase in its
defense spending, despite the hardships expected from international
sanctions imposed after its own nuclear tests.
	   Also Monday, India rejected reports it was planning another
nuclear test.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh said Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan's claims that India was surreptitiously
preparing to conduct more tests next month was ``surprising'' _ and
wrong.
	   ``India has declared a moratorium on testing, and this has been
reiterated by the prime minister himself,'' Singh said.
	   His ministry reiterated India's long-standing call for
international talks on reducing nuclear weapons in a statement
Sunday.
	   India's five tests May 11-13 escalated the long-standing
Indo-Pakistan rivalry to the nuclear level. Pakistan reponded with
what it said were six detonations of its own; five on Friday and
one on Saturday. Pakistan has not said whether it will test again;
U.S. intelligence sources say they have detected no signs that
either Pakistan or India is readying new tests.
	   Speaking at a news conference Monday, Kharrazi defended
Pakistan's tests, saying India left Pakistan no choice.
	   ``As a matter of its national security and to create a balance
in the region,'' Pakistan had to respond with its own nuclear
tests, he said. ``Over the world, Muslims are happy that Pakistan
has this capability.''
	   The leader of the militant Palestinian Hamas group, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, echoed the Iranian leader, calling Pakistan's nuclear
capability ``an asset to the Arab and Muslim nations.''
	   But a leading Islamic organization expressed ``deep concern''
over the tests and urged immediate talks by India and Pakistan.
	   The ``international community must seriously encourage both
India and Pakistan to expediently conclude a nonaggression
agreement with the aim of ensuring the promotion of peace and
security in the region,'' the Organization of the Islamic
Conference said in a statement Monday in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
	   China, an ally of Pakistan, said it would urge world powers to
find a way to halt the nuclear arms race when foreign ministers of
the U.N. Security Council's permanent members meet later this week
in Geneva.
	   Kharrazi dismissed suggestions that Iran was preparing to follow
Pakistan with tests of its own.
	   ``We don't have any nuclear weapons program,'' Kharrazi said.
``What we have is for peaceful purposes.''
	   Iran has repeatedly denied U.S. and Israeli allegations that it
is close to building a nuclear weapon. Kharrazi said Iran's nuclear
facilities are open to international inspectors.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged last week to
safeguard his country's nuclear technology and not to share it with
any other nation.
	   Meanwhile, India's new Hindu nationalist government unveiled a
budget Monday that included a 14 percent increase in defense
spending _ and a hefty 68 percent increase in spending on atomic
energy.
	   The country's space program, which includes missiles, also got a
62 percent budget increase.
	   India has threatened to step up military activity on its side of
the troubled Kashmir border _ the flash point of two previous wars
between the two countries. They fought a third war in 1971 over
Bangladesh, or what was then East Pakistan.
	   Pakistan accused India of preparing to attack its nuclear sites
last week, and scrambled its own air force and put its soldiers on
alert.
	   The latest accusation came from Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub who said his country had ``credible evidence'' that
India was preparing a second site to test nuclear weapons. India
denied the accusation.

Poll: Hanson splits conservatives, Labor Party to take Queensland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A new poll released Tuesday predicted
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party will split the conservative vote
in Queensland's June 13 election, lifting the opposition Labor
Party to power.
	   If Labor ousts conservative Premier Rob Borbidge's government,
it will be a bad omen for the nationwide chances of Prime Minister
John Howard and his conservatives in the federal election expected
later this year.
	   Whether or not Hanson's party, famous for its anti-gun control,
anti-Asian immigration, and anti-Aboriginal welfare policies wins
any seats itself, it would have made a major impact on Australia's
political landscape.
	   In an effort to win back potential One Nation voters, Borbidge
has been talking tough on crime, unveiling new legislation to make
sure violent criminals serve their entire sentence with new parole.
	   Labor and Borbidge's conservatives currently hold 44 seats each
in the state's 89-seat Parliament; Borbidge has governed only
because a single conservative independent member of Parliament has
voted with his side.
	   The Newspoll survey in The Australian newspaper shows support
for the governing conservative coalition in big-city Brisbane seats
dropped from 42 percent to 25 percent while Labor had soared from
49 to 54 percent.
	   The Newspoll showed support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation
Party had tripled to 15 percent in the past six months statewide,
and almost doubled to 7 percent nationally in the past two weeks.
	   In Queensland rural areas, support for the governing
conservatives had slumped from 54 percent to 41 percent.
	   Borbidge told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Tuesday that
it looked like his party was ``behind the eight ball.''
	   The poll was conducted last weekend by telephone to 1,007
Queensland households. Newspoll said the margin of error on various
questions ranged from 3 to 4.4 percent, depending on the number of
respondents.
	   The poll suggests the Labor Party under Peter Beattie would gain
enough seats to hold a comfortable majority even if One Nation
Party wins several seats on its own, thus denying Hanson the
balance of power.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Much of the Arab world greeted with concern
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan but blamed the arms race on the
West for turning a blind eye to Israel's secretive nuclear arsenal.
	   Echoing the worldwide condemnation of the tests last month by
the two South Asian enemies, several Arab nations urged them to
show restraint from now on and start a dialogue to end their
conflicts.
	   The Muslim world's main group, the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, issued a statement Monday expressing ``deep concern
over this serious development.''
	   India's five tests May 11-13 escalated the long-standing
Indo-Pakistan rivalry to the nuclear level. Pakistan reponded with
what it said were six detonations of its own; five on Friday and
one on Saturday.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since they were carved
from the same British colony 50 years ago. They are divided by
religion _ Pakistan is officially Muslim and India is predominately
Hindu _ and a simmering territorial dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir, which is divided between them and claimed by
both countries.
	   The world ``must seriously encourage'' India and Pakistan to
quickly sign a non-aggression treaty to prevent regional
instability, the OIC, a 55-nation group that includes Arab as well
as other countries such as Iran and Indonesia, said in a statement.
	   But the Arabs were quick to point out that Israel, located in
the center of a hostile Arab world, has most likely possessed
nuclear bombs for decades without facing any punishment from the
rest of the world.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi defended Pakistan's
tests, saying India left Pakistan no choice.
	   At a news conference during a visit to Pakistan on Monday,
Kharrazi also said Muslims in the Middle East long had worried
about Israel's nuclear capability and could now feel confident that
a fellow Islamic nation possessed similar abilities.
	   ``As a matter of its national security and to create a balance
in the region,'' Pakistan had to respond with its own nuclear
tests, he said.
	   The leader of a radical Palestinian guerrilla group also boasted
that the Muslims now have an Islamic bomb to counter Israel.
	   ``Pakistan's possession of nuclear power is to be considered an
asset to the Arab and Muslim nations,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas movement, said.
	   But if other Arab nations felt any pride in that fact, they
didn't show it.
	   Kuwait, which has good relations with Pakistan and India, said
it expresses its ``extreme regret and worry about this arms race
... and its dangerous consequences on the security and stability of
the area.''
	   The Saudi Arabian government issued a statement Monday claiming
``double standards by the international community through excluding
Israel from nuclear inspections have encouraged the nuclear arms
race.
	   The United States imposed harsh sanctions on Libya, Iraq and
Iran _ and now on India and Pakistan _ for trying to acquire
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Similar statements were made earlier by the United Arab Emirates
and Lebanon.
	   Egypt, the Arab world's stalwart, criticized neither Pakistan
nor its traditional ally India. But Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said their explosions have proved that an international treaty
banning nuclear tests ``has gone with the wind.''
	   Israel is believed to have 100 nuclear warheads. Successive
Israeli governments have refused to either confirm that or allow
the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog,
to inspect its facilities.
	   Israel has warned that the Indian and Pakistani tests could
encourage Iran to follow suit.
	   But Kharrazi said his government has no intention of developing
a bomb and that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

Eds: Includes items on Bierhoff challenging Ronaldo; Hoddle defends
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff held off Brazilian star
Ronaldo in the race for the scoring champion in the just-concluded
Serie A season in Italy, and says he can do the same at the World
Cup.
	   ``I have always looked for a rival as a point of reference. Even
as a boy,'' the German told Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday. ``It
gave me the motivation to commit myself. Hopefully I can beat
Ronaldo again _ at the World Cup and in the league.''
	   Bierhoff tallied 27 goals for third-place Udinese this season,
while Ronaldo had 25 for runner-up Inter Milan. They'll be
neighbors next year, though, with Bierhoff having transferred to AC
Milan.
	   ___  
	   LA MANGA, Spain (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle said Monday he
dropped controversial midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the final
22-man World Cup team solely because he wasn't fit.
	   On Sunday, Hoddle stunned England with his decision not to
include the 31-year-old Gascoigne, rated by some as the best
midfielder in English history.
	   The story was one of the biggest soccer items to hit England
since the team won its sole World Cup in 1966.
	   As well as Gascoigne, Hoddle also dropped five other players _
Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker, Manchester United's Phil Neville
and Nicky Butt, Coventry's Dion Dublin and Everton's Andy
Hinchcliffe _ to get down to the final 22-man team.
	   ___  
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Brazil is favored to win its fifth World
Cup, but Norwegian Coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said Monday there is
a chance the defending champions would not make it through Group A.
	   ``Brazil is not as good as the FIFA ranking suggests, and it is
not unthinkable that they will be beaten by two of the teams in
group A. But I don't think that will happen,'' Olsen said.
	   Brazil tops FIFA's ranking, Norway is seventh.
	   Brazil opens the World Cup against Scotland on June 10.
	   In May 1997, Olsen's team stunned the world beating Brazil 4-2
in Oslo.
	   ___  
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria, losers 3-0 on Friday to
Yugoslavia, may be looking for a new goalkeeper.
	   Radio talk shows and daily newspapers were filled Monday with
criticism of goalkeeper Abiodun Baruwa, who allowed in all three
goals in the Friday's loss.
	   Many fans called for the return of Peter Rufai, who plays for
Spanish side Deportivo La Cornua, to the No. 1 spot on Nigeria's
World Cup-bound squad.
	   Former national team captain Segun Odegbami said goalkeeping was
merely part of a larger problem _ growing team apathy.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff says France's
public recognition of the 1915 genocide of ethnic Armenians in
Turkey inspired his spectacular goal in a 2-2 draw against Morocco
last week.
	   Djorkaeff, whose mother is Armenian, said he came on as
substitute determined to score after hearing the news that
lawmakers had passed a motion recognizing as ``genocide'' the
deaths of 1.5 million Armenians.
	   ``It was a great day for me because France acknowledged the
genocide of Armenians,'' Djorkaeff said in an interview published
Monday with sports daily L'Equipe.
	   ``I thought of it as I went onto the pitch. I wanted to do
something special, and that's how goals like that are scored.''
	   ___  
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav Coach Slobodan Santrac on
Monday dropped striker Anto Drobnjak and midfielder Albert Nadj
from Yugoslavia's 22-man World Cup squad.
	   Drobjak, of French champion's Lens, and Nadj, of Betis in Spain,
will not travel to France, where Yugoslavia faces the United
States, Germany and Iran in the preliminary rounds.
	   Nadj, angering Santrac, reportedly refused to start on defense
before Yugoslavia's friendly warm-up with Nigeria last Friday which
the Yugoslav team won 3-0.
	   Santrac had a large choice of strikers and Drobnjak lost his
place in competition with Predrag Mijatovic and Darko Kovacevic.
	   The Yugoslav team up front includes forwards Predrag Mijatovic,
Savo Milosevic, Darko Kovacevic, Perica Ognjenovic.
	   ___  
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ On Germany's team of oldies, whose
average age is over 30, one new face may have cracked the starting
lineup.
	   Defensive midfielder Jens Jeremies, the team's baby at 24,
turned in an outstanding performance in the European champion's 3-1
victory over Colombia Saturday.
	   ``Our best player was our youngster Jens,'' coach Berti Vogts
said. ``The way he worked for (offensive midfielders) Andreas
Moeller and Thomas Haessler, how he gave commands and stripped
players of the ball _ that impressed me a lot.''
	   Jeremies played for 1860 Munich last season and will transfer to
cross-town rival Bayern Munich next season.

	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Tunisian coach Henri Kasperczak Monday
announced his squad for the World Cup, including four
European-based players he hopes will give the team vital
international experience.
	   It will be the second time Tunisia has played in a World Cup,
coming 20 years after its debut in Argentina. Many observers say
the current squad is the most talented Tunisia has ever fielded.
	   Kasperczak, from Poland, chose four players from European
leagues: striker Adel Sellimi of Spanish second division team Jaen,
the Freiburg (Germany) duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mahdi Ben Slimane,
and France's Bastia goalkeeper Ali Bou Mnijel.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's players were ecstatic after
their convincing 3-1 win over Colombia Saturday, saying it revealed
the potential of their World Cup team.
	   ``We've very well prepared and we've got a good troop together _
now we want to prove it in France,'' said team captain Juergen
Klinsmann.
	   But Colombia coach Dario Gomez wasn't as happy with his players,
who seemed overwhelmed by Germany's pressure tactics. Within 16
minutes, the South Americans were down 2-0 on two Oliver Bierhoff
goals.
	   Before the match, Colombia's players chose to warm up in the
dressing rooms instead of on the field.
	   ``Germany unquestioningly has the potential to reach the
semifinals again _ but that showed how passive my players were,''
Gomez said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Angelo Peruzzi will be playing during the World Cup
_ playing a role in a TV ad, that is.
	   Italy's starting goalkeeper, out of France '98 with a calf
injury, is the star of an adverstisement for Gatorade. The spot is
centered on Peruzzi's thoughts before facing a penalty kick.
	   ``I am happy that my injury did not make them change their minds
about using the ad,'' said Peruzzi, who hurt himself while training
Sunday. ``It would have been a shame not to see the fruit of our
work.''
	   The ad will air for the first time Tuesday night, during Italy's
World Cup tuneup match at non-qualifier Sweden.

	   SAFTICA, Romania (AP) _ Romania's soccer team hopes to make it
into the semi-finals of this summer's World Cup in France, topping
its performance of four years ago, when it fell in the
quarter-finals.
	   ``We might qualify for semi-finals if we play well,'' said
Gheorghe Popescu, a key part of Romania's defense, who plays
professionally for Turkey's champion Galatasaray.
	   His teammate with Galatasaray, Gheorghe Hagi, known as ``the
Maradona of the Carpathians,'' said Romania's most difficult game
would be its first one, June 15 against Colombia.

<SLUG> BC-Newspaper: Contracts to be signed for high-speed rail link to </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>
Channel Tunnel 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Contracts to build a 5.4 billion pound (dlrs 8.9
billion) high-speed rail link from London to the Channel Tunnel are
expected to be signed Tuesday, the Financial Times has reported.
	   The newspaper predicted Tuesday that Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott would tell the House of Commons on Wednesday that his
search for new backers to rescue the troubled 68-mile
(110-kilometer) link has been successful.
	   A spokeswoman for Prescott's Department of Environment,
Transport and the Regions would not confirm the Financial Times
report.
	   ``The Deputy Prime Minister said he wanted to make an
announcement as soon as possible after the (Parliament) recess,''
said the spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
``But I am not in a position to confirm any particular date at this
stage.''
	   London and Continental Railways Ltd., which won the contract to
build the link in February 1996, said in January that it was 1.2
billion pounds (dlrs 1.9 billion) short.
	   The government refused to provide the funds and said that unless
the money could be raised, the state would take over the project.
	   The government has already committed 1.8 billion pounds (dlrs
2.8 billion) to the link, which would carry trains at 300 kph (186
mph) through southeast England and is due for completion in 2003.
	   Currently, passengers who ride the Channel Tunnel trains from
Paris to London whiz at high speed through France, only to slow
down after they cross under the sea and amble along British
commuter tracks.
	   Under the reported deal, London  Continental Railways would
receive financial backing from rail infrastructure group Railtrack.
	   The Financial Times said the company would build the link in
stages, with Railtrack agreeing to buy the first phase _ from the
tunnel to Ebbsfleet in north Kent _ at a price reflecting
construction costs.
	   Railtrack would take an option over the later, more expensive
sections of the line into central London, the newspaper said.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid organizations struggled to
deliver emergency supplies and treat injured survivors of an
earthquake in a remote region of northern Afghanistan that killed
at least 3,000 people and left thousands more homeless.
	   Landslides cut off roads to the hardest-hit areas, where 16
villages were destroyed, blocking aid trucks, Martin Griffiths,
U.N. deputy emergency relief coordinator, said Monday in New York.
	   ``This is a scenario from hell,'' Griffiths said. ``It's a
region which is extremely inaccessible.''
	   As aftershocks rumbled through the region Monday, frightened
residents scrambled out of the few homes still standing and refused
to go back inside.
	   The quake, which hit Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of
6.9, flattened entire villages, cracked mountains and unleashed
landslides across this rugged, remote region of struggling farmers.
Estimates of the dead ranged from 3,000 to 5,000.
	   Thousands more were missing or homeless. About 45,000 of the
area's 70,000 people have no shelter, Griffiths said.
	   The quake sent houses tumbling down mountainsides into the
valleys below. Up to 80 villages were estimated to be heavily
damaged, and another dozen obliterated.
	   In Chaujan, a village near the quake's epicenter, the scene was
horrific. Thousands of homes were gone. People wandered, dazed,
through the rubble.
	   In the middle of the devastation, a lone wooden door stood
erect, clumps of mud on it the only reminder of the home that once
stood. The family of four who lived there was dead.
	   Tending to the injured was a priority Monday. The International
Red Cross and the United Nations set up mobile medical units in
Shari Basurkh, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Faisabad, the capital
of northern Badakhshan province.
	   Doctors Without Borders were operating a clinic there.
Helicopters ferried the wounded, many of them with broken bones,
most of them small children and the elderly.
	   Aid workers distributed blankets, tents and plastic sheeting.
	   Among the hardest-hit areas was Rostaq, the site of a Feb. 4
earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left another
8,000 homeless.
	   Many residents were living in tents even before the quake,
having lost their homes in the February quake.
	   The region is in the control of an alliance fighting the Taliban
religious army, which holds the Afghan capital, Kabul. Anti-Taliban
soldiers say they have recovered 1,650 bodies, but added that
thousands more were dead.
	   Aid workers said people were traumatized, their eyes unfocused,
their hands automatically searching through the rubble. With poor
sanitation and recent rains, the risks of malaria, cholera and
hemorrhagic fever were rising as each day passed.
	   Many homes simply crumbled into dust in Saturday's violent
shaking, after being cracked by the February quake and pounded by
recent, relentless rains.
	   Cargo aircraft from neighboring Pakistan, packed with emergency
supplies, reached Faisabad on Monday. A U.N. disaster coordination
team was flying in Monday to help manage the aid operation.
	   France was sending about 35 tons of aid to Dushanbe, Tajikistan,
to be transported to the disaster area. Japan, the European Union,
and the Netherlands were also sending assistance.
	   ``The key here is to respond very, very quickly,'' Griffiths
said. ``The key thing we learned from the last time is to get air
transport in quickly.''

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Australian Susie Maroney became the first person
to swim from Mexico to Cuba, completing the estimated 197-kilometer
(122-mile) crossing in less than 39 hours.
	   Maroney, 23, touched Cuban soil at 5:03 a.m. on Monday, walking
onto the beach at Las Tumbas in eastern Cuba. She said Monday
afternoon that she was still feeling a bit weak.
	   ``I'm just really relieved that it's all over,'' she told The
Associated Press in Havana.
	   Maroney said she crossed the Yucatan Channel in 38 hours and 25
minutes, swimming in a shark-proof cage towed by her support team.
	   She suffered jelly fish stings and bruised wrists from hitting
the cage, but otherwise was in good shape.
	   Last year Maroney became the first woman to swim from Cuba to
Florida when she completed 190 kilometers (118 miles) in a record
24 hours and 34 minutes.
	   The crossing from Mexico's Isle Mujeres, near Cancun, to Cuba
was more difficult, she said.
	   The water was very choppy, Maroney said. She swallowed a lot of
sea water and suffered from seasickness, she said.
	   ``It was definitely the hardest swim,'' she said.
	   Though she said there were moments when she feared she wouldn't
finish, Maroney's spirits were boosted by the sight of dolphins and
turtles and the goal of becoming the first person to make the
crossing.
	   ``You do it for yourself personally,'' she said. ``It's just the
best feeling when you touch the sand and you realize you've swam
the furthest.''
	   Australian media reported that if the 197-kilometer (122-mile)
distance is verified, Maroney will be able to claim the record for
the longest distance ever swum at sea: In 1976, American marathon
swimmer Walter Poenisch swam 196 kilometers (121.5 miles) wearing
flippers in the Straits of Florida.
	   Maroney has been swimming long distance since she was 14, and
has crossed the English Channel twice. She set the women's record
for longest distance covered in 24 hours without the aid of ocean
currents _ 58.5 miles (94 kilometers) _ set in a swimming pool in
Brisbane, Australia on July 2-3, 1993.

Child marchers breathe new life into old U.N. agency 
</HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An exuberant group of children who have been
rescued from mines, sweatshops and servitude around the world
descended on Geneva Tuesday to breathe new life into an old U.N.
agency.
	   The children will be among the first speakers at the annual
meeting of the 174-nation International Labor Organization, which
is considering a new world convention aimed at abolishing the most
extreme forms of child labor.
	   The children, including a 15-year-old boy from Bangladesh who
lost a leg in a coal mine accident and an 11-year-old former
domestic servant from Nepal, are culminating a six-month campaign.
	   ``Go, go, global march,'' shouted the children Saturday as they
led more than 1,000 demonstrators through the streets of Geneva.
	   The campaign, sponsored by the ILO, the U.N. Children's Fund,
Scouts and other organizations, began last January in the
Philippines and has included marches in 62 countries in Asia,
Africa, North and South America and Europe.
	   Child labor tops the agenda of the annual two-week ILO meeting,
which brings together representatives of government, labor and
management. The ILO draws up and monitors conventions on a wide
range of labor issues.
	   The campaign against child labor was a boost for the ILO,
showing that the oldest U.N. agency stemming from the 1919 creation
of the former League of Nations is still needed to stop labor
abuses around the world.
	   The ILO has been singled out by the United States in its
campaign to reform the world organization. Some U.S. Republicans
have accused the ILO of being irrelevant.
	   Another visitor expected at the meeting was newly freed
Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan, who was imprisoned from
1996 until last week on charges relating to civil unrest and
alleged subversion. Other speakers were to include U.N. human
rights chief Mary Robinson and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.
	   The meeting will work on a declaration committing countries to
work toward collective bargaining and the elimination of forced
labor. The new child labor convention would call for criminal
penalties, specify preventative measures and rehabilitation of
child victims, according to the organization.
	   The labor organization also has called for new international
legal standards on child labor that would halt slavery and
slavery-like practices, forced labor and debt bondage. The
standards also would prevent children being used in prostitution
and pornography or any activity likely to jeopardize their health
or morals.
	   ILO surveys have found that a quarter of all children ages 5-14
are economically active, with many of them doing hazardous jobs.
	   ``Children are employed simply because they are cheaper and more
compliant than adults,'' said Neal Kearney, general secretary of
the Brussels-based International Textile, Garment and Leather
Workers Federation.

Asian crisis fuels current account deficit, Aussie dollar slumps 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian currency crisis fueled a
massive U.S. dlrs 1.22 billion (2 billion Australian dollars) rise
in Australia's current account deficit in the first three months of
1998, the government said Tuesday.
	   While the figure was within the range of expectations, it is
edging closer to 6 percent of gross domestic product, a level that,
back in 1986, then-Treasurer Paul Keating said was indicative of a
``banana republic.''
	   The overall economic problems also undermined the Australian
dollar, which slumped to 61.15 U.S. cents, a 12-year low.
	   The slump in Asian prices for Australian products pushed the
current account deficit to a three-year high of U.S. dlrs 4.57
billion (7.5 billion Australian dollars), widening by 33 percent
since the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
said.
	   Economists had predicted the blowout, blaming the Asian currency
crisis and struggling exports.
	   Net foreign debt rose to U.S. dlrs 137 billion (225 billion
Australian dollars), the Bureau said.
	   The All Ordinaries stock index lost 45 points, 1.6 percent of
its value, by midday Tuesday.

Newspaper: Contracts to be signed for high-speed rail link to Channel Tunnel 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Contracts to build a 5.4 billion pound (dlrs 8.9
billion) high-speed rail link from London to the Channel Tunnel are
expected to be signed Tuesday, the Financial Times has reported.
	   The newspaper predicted Tuesday that Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott would tell the House of Commons on Wednesday that his
search for new backers to rescue the troubled 68-mile
(110-kilometer) link has been successful.
	   A spokeswoman for Prescott's Department of Environment,
Transport and the Regions would not confirm the Financial Times
report.
	   ``The Deputy Prime Minister said he wanted to make an
announcement as soon as possible after the (Parliament) recess,''
said the spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
``But I am not in a position to confirm any particular date at this
stage.''
	   London and Continental Railways Ltd., which won the contract to
build the link in February 1996, said in January that it was 1.2
billion pounds (dlrs 1.9 billion) short.
	   The government refused to provide the funds and said that unless
the money could be raised, the state would take over the project.
	   The government has already committed 1.8 billion pounds (dlrs
2.8 billion) to the link, which would carry trains at 300 kph (186
mph) through southeast England and is due for completion in 2003.
	   Currently, passengers who ride the Channel Tunnel trains from
Paris to London whiz at high speed through France, only to slow
down after they cross under the sea and amble along British
commuter tracks.
	   Under the reported deal, London  Continental Railways would
receive financial backing from rail infrastructure group Railtrack.
	   The Financial Times said the company would build the link in
stages, with Railtrack agreeing to buy the first phase _ from the
tunnel to Ebbsfleet in north Kent _ at a price reflecting
construction costs.
	   Railtrack would take an option over the later, more expensive
sections of the line into central London, the newspaper said.

Palestinian security firm patrols east Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On their first night on the job, a team of
Palestinian security guards dressed in matching black jackets
bearing the company emblem _ the Dome of the Rock Mosque _ hit the
streets of east Jerusalem in search of trouble.
	   With crime on the upswing and no Palestinian police allowed in
the eastern sector of Jerusalem, a group of Arab residents decided
to take security into their own hands and turn a profit.
	   Abdul Razzaq Ghazzawi, co-owner of the newly founded Jerusalem
Security Services, and a former Israeli police officer said his
company could fill the niche. ``We will protect the property
here,'' he said.
	   In March, professional thieves broke into a bank by drilling
holes through three neighboring stores. And recently, robbers
managed to walk out of a building in the area's busiest street with
a giant safe.
	   The Israeli police, who have jurisdiction in the area are
investigating the crimes, but they maintain a small presence in
east Jerusalem and often do not receive the full cooperation of
Palestinians, distrustful of the Israelis who took over the area in
the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Israel annexed east Jerusalem shortly after the war, but the
Palestinians want it as the capital of a future state. Palestinian
leaders have for years been calling for a civilian Palestinian
police force.
	   Peace accords with Israel allowed Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority to operate in all Palestinian cities, but prevented it
from working in Jerusalem and left the city's status open for
future negotiations.
	   The security company received verbal approval from Israeli
authorities to go ahead ``as long as it does not break the law or
establish relations with the Palestinian Authority,'' the company's
lawyer, Jawad Bulous, said.
	   That agreement is fine with the owners.
	   ``We will not get involved in politics. Already some of our
customers are afraid that the Israelis will close us down, and we
do not want that to happen,'' Ghazzawi said.
	   In the past, Israel has tried to prevent Palestinian security
forces connected to the Authority government from operating in
Jerusalem. Shmuel Ben Ruby, a spokesman for the Jerusalem police
said he was checking into the company's approvals.
	   The 25 young men of the security firm are armed with batons,
flashlights, stun guns and small mace canisters and only work at
night. Firearms were not provided however, ``to avoid any legal
wrangling with the Israeli police.''
	   On Monday, four guards rode on scooters past store fronts, while
others patrolled the unlit streets and winding stone alley ways on
foot. They received no formal training, but Ghazzawi said he gave
them two directives: Protect the stores and do not get involved in
police work.
	   The Palestinian Chamber of Commerce has already given the
company its blessing and sent out letters to over 1000 business in
east Jerusalem touting the new company's services.
	   Ali Tazziz, who chairs the chamber said it was Israel's
disregard of the traditionally Palestinian side of the city which
led to the need for the company.
	   ``The west side gets all the attention, protection and
services,'' Tazziz said. ``We were forced to do this because of
their neglect,'' he said.

Dollar higher, stocks bounce back moderately in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday currency, stock and bond prices
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher in morning trading
Tuesday amid continuing pessimism about Japan's economy, though it
retreated from seven-year highs reached overnight in New York.
Tokyo stocks rose.
	   The dollar bought 139.53 yen in early trading, up 0.41 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo. In New York overnight, the dollar settled at
139.70 yen, its highest level since June 24, 1991.
	   The dollar has gained steadily in recent weeks against the yen
as sluggish consumer spending and the write-off of some 76 trillion
yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad loans by the nation's banks cloud the
outlook for Japan's economy.
	   But the dollar ceded some of its gains in early Tokyo trading
amid a rising chorus of concern for the weakening yen by Japanese
finance officials.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told reporters Tuesday the yen
is too weak and Japan will take decisive action to defend it. The
same day, Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's international
finance bureau, said the pace of the Japanese currency's decline is
too fast.
	   ``In any case, I have strong concern about an excessively weak
yen, and we will take appropriate and decisive action against it,''
Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   On the stock market, sentiment improved slightly after Monday's
announcement that Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese brokerage,
and Travelers Group of the United States were planning an equity
tie-up.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 120.58
points, or 0.79 percent, to 15,441.61 at the close of the morning
session. On Monday, the index had lost 349.75 points, or 2.23
percent.
	   ``The market welcomed Nikko's alliance, as it will likely
trigger more Japanese financial institutions' tie-ups with foreign
institutions,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities.
	   Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy had
triggered Monday's fall.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 9.33 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,206.03. The
TOPIX fell 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.130 percent from Monday's record low
finish of 1.155 percent, driving its price up to 112.59 yen from
112.41 yen.

Forget gas guzzlers: kids, countryfolk drive lean and license-free 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LES HERBIERS, France (AP) _ For landlocked countryfolk without
driver's licenses and chic Parisian teen-agers evading parental
chauffeuring, a tiny contraption has been a boon.
	   At first sight, it's cute as a bug and not much bigger. The
two-seat Microcar has to be to stay under the weight and speed
limits of a ``voiturette,'' or ``quadricycle.''
	   Owners don't seem to mind that it's like riding atop a
lawnmower. They like the legal loophole: you don't need a driver's
license.
	   Never mind that Americans are embracing gas guzzlers thanks to
rock-bottom prices at the pump. Europe's ``micro'' and larger
``mini'' car markets are benefiting from gasoline prices that can
top dlrs 1.10 a liter (dlrs 4 a gallon).
	   Microcar and eight other ``micro'' producers in France and Italy
expect to sell 25,000 units this year, up from about 16,000 last
year.
	   At the assembly plant in this village outside Nantes in western
France, lines of red, blue, gray and green Microcars hang from a
yellow overhead conveyor belt that cranks out about 30 a day.
	   A well-heeled subsidiary of the pleasure boating giant Jeanneau
_ bought out in 1995 by another yachting giant, Beneteau _ Microcar
glues together a featherweight body from nine pieces of reinforced
polyester, using parts from regular automakers. The cars are
limited to 350 kilograms (770 pounds).
	   The Yamaha diesel engine powers the car up to 43.5 kph (27 mph)
and uses 3.5 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers (gets about 68
miles per gallon).
	   The micros aren't much cheaper than some of their slightly
larger competitors _ the minis like the Rover 100, Renault Twingo
and Fiat Cinquecento. Microcar's sticker price starts at about
50,000 francs (dlrs 8,300).
	   But the edge is, you don't need a license. Anyone 16 and over
can drive them.
	   ``I'm 16, and it's changed my life,'' says Emmanuelle Bousquet,
whose family lives in the upscale western Paris suburb of Boulogne.
``I don't have to depend on taxis, buses, the subway, my parents.''
	   With Mom and Dad's help, she's added electric windows and
leather upholstery to her trendy gray voiturette _ options Microcar
offers to attract the Gucci crowd.
	   Outside Orleans in the Loire Valley, Jacqueline Bourgeot has
been driving micros since 1984. As an epileptic, she can't get a
license.
	   ``I'm independent with this car. I'm not forced to wait for my
husband,'' said Bourgeot, 49, a nurse who works nights.
	   She doesn't deny her Microcar is a bit loud, ``but it makes less
noise than my Aixam and my Erade'' _ earlier versions of other
makes.
	   Microcar also makes a quiet electric version that looks like a
small beach buggy, and some hybrid models use electric and diesel
motors.
	   So far, European officials don't see micros as a road hazard.
They're already banned from freeways because they have to stay
under 45 kph (28 mph).
	   But it's anyone's guess how many owners may have lost their
licenses because of drunk driving or other offenses, and no
accident statistics are available.
	   Up to now, there's been no clamor to do away with the legal
loophole in France, Italy, Spain and a handful of other countries.
But Britain and the Netherlands are among those that require
licenses, and the European Union is studying how to standardize
regulations on licenses and safety.
	   The micros are part of the smaller-is-beautiful trend in
Europe's car market. Analysts expect Europe's overall subcompact
auto sales to rise more than 9 percent in 1998.
	   Of course, Emmanuelle dreams of her 18th birthday, when she
hopes to get a Volkswagen Golf. In the meantime, her parents can at
least be happy she's riding on four wheels.
	   ``A scooter is too dangerous for Paris,'' she says.

	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ Suzanne Nesbit knows pantyhose problems.
	   Snags, runs, rips and tears _ always at the most inconvenient
times _ are always followed by the traditional quick fix with
smelly nail polish.
	   ``And when you do use nail polish ... it sticks to your leg and
you end up tearing off layers of skin when you try to take the hose
off,'' Nesbit said.
	   But Nesbit, a 36-year-old pharmacist who says she often snags
her hose on desk corners and other equipment at Akron General
Hospital, has found a new product that may be a boon to
long-suffering women.
	   RunFree Instant Hosiery Repair is an odor-free, colorless liquid
that comes in a small tube and is applied with a brush like nail
polish.
	   It was created by Robert Horning and Deborah Vollmer who are
betting that women are looking for better ways to patch their
stockings and cut down on their hosiery costs. Industry experts
believe it may be the first run-repair product of its kind.
	   Horning and Ms. Vollmer, both of Akron, were on a date at a
restaurant when she discovered she had a run in her stocking. She
borrowed some nail polish from a woman in the ladies room.
	   ``When I returned to the table, I told Bob I hoped the nail
polish odor wasn't too strong, and he wanted to know why I was
putting on nail polish in the middle of dinner,'' she said.
	   Horning said he couldn't believe there wasn't a product to
repair runs in women's hosiery. ``I guess, being a guy, I just
never had thought about it,'' Horning said.
	   They began brainstorming and decided they would give it a try.
After consulting with chemists and physicists and testing more than
400 compounds, RunFree was developed in 1994.
	   The next few years were spent working on packaging and
marketing, and in November 1997, RunFree went on the market,
retailing for dlrs 4.95 a bottle. A bottle will fix more than 60
runs and 100 snags.
	   The clear liquid has only slight scent for second or two when
first applied, then is odor-free. It can't be seen on hose the way
nail polish can, and doesn't become hard. It also seems to
withstand washings.
	   Ann Coburn, 65, likes it so much she ordered 15 tubes to give
out as party favors.
	   ``It's nice to have something you can use for quick repairs,
especially since you inevitably get runs and tears when you are
running late or on your way to something important,'' she said.
	   Susan Stromberg, manager of the Capezio Dance Theater Shop in
the Cleveland suburb of Lyndhurst, has sold about 30 bottles and is
on her second order.
	   ``I've sent samples to our stores in New York, Dallas and Boston
and it seems to be selling well if you bring it to customers'
attention,'' she said. ``We sell products for adult ballroom and
ballet dancers and for children in dance classes, and those
stockings and tights can be really expensive to replace, with some
costing as much as dlrs 23.''
	   Ms. Stromberg says her customers like RunFree because it can be
used before runs even start to reinforce toes and panty.
	   ``RunFree will outlive your pantyhose,'' she said. ``The threads
will eventually wear thin in other parts of the stockings before
the area with the run or snag treated with RunFree gives out.''
	   Sid Smith, president and chief executive officer of the National
Association of Hosiery Manufacturers, said women have tried a wide
range of techniques to extend the life of their stockings _ even
putting hosiery in the freezer with the hope that it will help
prevent runs.
	   But Smith knew of no other product aimed specifically at
patching runs. He said he hasn't taken a look at RunFree yet.
	   He did have an answer for the age-old question: Why can't
manufacturers make pantyhose that won't run?
	   ``Women would like pantyhose that don't run, but they also want
sheerness,'' said Smith. ``The strength of hosiery is directly
related to the size of the yarn, and the heavier yarn you use, the
less sheerness you are going to have.''
	   Smith said there is nothing on the horizon to suggest a no-run,
sheer pantyhose will be available in the near future.
	   And that, say the makers of RunFree, is what they are counting
on.

Up, up and away _ adult fees for U.S. amusement parks on the rise AP Business Writer

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ When Disneyland opened its gates in
1955, it cost dlrs 1 to get in.
	   Four decades later, the California landmark and amusement parks
around the United States are charging prices that on popular
vacation days in the past could have bought admission for the whole
neighborhood.
	   Nowhere is the steep rise in prices more pronounced than in
Orlando, the theme park capital of the world. In the past month,
the area's three major parks _ Disney, Seagram's Universal Studios
Florida and Anheuser-Busch's Sea World _ have each raised the price
of admission for an adult by more than dlrs 2, to dlrs 44.52,
including tax.
	   The fees leave some visitors as breathless as a roller-coaster
ride.
	   ``I was quite surprised. It was very expensive,'' said Pippa
Timmins, a British tourist visiting Orlando with her husband and
three children. During their two-week vacation, the family from
Peterborough, England, visited Magic Kingdom, Disney-MGM Studios
and Sea World.
	   The scenario is the same nationwide. Knott's Berry Farm outside
Los Angeles has raised its adult ticket price dlrs 1 to dlrs 36.
Paramount's Kings Dominion near Richmond, Virginia, and Cedar Point
in Sandusky, Ohio, raised adult ticket prices dlrs 2 to dlrs 32.
	   Over the past decade, some parks have increased admission fees
by as much as 75 percent. In 1989, a ticket to Sea World cost dlrs
25, Walt Disney World charged dlrs 30.50 and a visitor could get
into both Kings Dominion and Cedar Point for dlrs 20, according to
the trade publication Amusement Business.
	   The higher prices haven't hurt business. A record 167.2 million
people passed through the 50 most-frequented amusement parks in
North America last year, Amusement Business said.
	   Most theme parks raise their prices every two years or so, said
Donna Ross, executive vice president of the Florida Attractions
Association.
	   Theme park owners and managers say they aren't to blame _
increases come from the higher minimum wage and the public's desire
for something new.
	   Both Knott's Berry Farm and Cedar Point, for example, are
launching new tower rides which drop patrons into a controlled
free-fall from several hundred feet in the air. Each costs several
million dollars to build and customers pick up the tab.
	   In central Florida, Disney has added a new theme park, Animal
Kingdom; Universal added a multimillion-dollar Twister ride based
on the film; and Sea World added Journey to Atlantis, a roller
coaster-water flume ride.
	   ``It's a continued investment in our business,'' said Tom
Schroeder, a Universal spokesman. ``We're in the business of
creating fresh, innovative attractions and to do that requires
money. We need to get a return on our investments.''
	   Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Florida, raised its adult
admission by dlrs 1 to dlrs 31 because of the increase in the
minimum wage, co-owner Sharon Creedon said.
	   ``We don't live in a vacuum. Your costs keep growing,'' she
said. ``If all those costs remained stagnant, we could have our
prices remain stagnant.''
	   There are discounts that couldn't be found a decade ago, too.
	   Both Sea World and Universal have ``second-day free'' offers and
there are off-season discounts for state residents. Tourists in
Orlando can even get tickets as low as dlrs 17.50 if they listen to
a 90-minute pitch from a salesman trying to sell them a vacation
home first.
	   Despite the costly tickets, the parks are going to have to
charge a lot more money before they scare the Timmins family away.
Mrs. Timmins and her husband, Peter, spent dlrs 5,000 on a two-week
tourist package that included airfare, hotel, a rental car and
theme parks admission.
	   ``When they start charging dlrs 100, that's when we'll think
twice,'' Timmins said.

Thai inflation expected to fall by year's end, deputy premier says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's soaring inflation rate is
likely to fall in the second half of the year and will be below IMF
targets by year's end, a deputy prime minister predicted.
	   Supachai Patichpakdi, who is also commerce minister, said in an
interview late Monday on the ITV television station that declining
inflation would allow high interest rates to fall as well.
	   ``That will benefit the entire economic system,'' Supachai said,
without giving any estimated figures.
	   High interest rates are crippling Thai businesses struggling to
survive the current recession, which the government said last week
will be far deeper and probably longer than previously expected.
	   The International Monetary Fund has demanded that Thailand keep
inflation at an average of 10.5 percent for the year as a condition
of receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package.
	   The economy has begun to stabilize under the administration of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but new declines in the currency and
stock market this week on fears of a deeper recession underscored
how far the country still has to go.
	   The Commerce Ministry released data Monday that showed Thai
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, the worst
inflation in more than three years. It was the fifth consecutive
month this year that the index has risen.
	   Inflation has worsened steadily since July 1997, when Thailand
abandoned its fixed-exchange rate system under attacks by currency
speculators and triggered a chain reaction of crises across Asia.

Premier rejects anti-loitering laws for Olympics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The state government has criticized a
push by Olympic mayors to clear the streets of hawkers, beggars and
loiterers before and during the 2000 Olympics.
	   The group of mayors representing Olympic areas has lodged a
submission for more powers to deal with loiterers with the state's
local government minister Ernie Page.
	   But New South Wales premier Bob Carr said ``unfortunates'' would
not be removed from Sydney streets just to create a good
impression.
	   ``Any idea that we behave like Hitler in 1936 by getting
unfortunate people off the streets to present a false image to the
world should not be embraced,'' Carr said Tuesday. ``It's not going
to be done as a special artificial, cosmetic measure for the
Olympics.''
	   Carr said it was wrong to make special loitering laws for the
games. Atlanta enacted such laws for the 1996 games.
	   ``I reject the notion that we ought to be doing anything special
in this respect for the Olympics,'' Carr said.
	   ``We ought to be meeting the problem of the homeless because
it's the good thing to do, not because it's related to the
Olympics.''

Severe water rationing for parts of Kuala Lumpur 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Residents in large parts of the
Malaysian capital may get water only once every three days as a
severe draught forces authorities to consider drastic rationing, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Rationing water may be the only way of stretching reserves that
have fallen sharply in the absence of rain, the Star newspaper said
quoting the Selangor Waterworks Department.
	   One major reservoir near Kuala Lumpur has only enough water to
supply city residents for another 10 days, the newspaper warned.
	   ``The dam level now is only 1.26 meters (4.1 feet) above the
critical level of 204.2 meters (673.8 feet),'' V. Subramaniam of
the department said. Below the critical level it is difficult to
pump water.
	   The dam that normally supplies 477 million liters a day to the
city was able to pump out only 191 million liters on Monday, the
daily said.
	   Three other dams that provide water to the city were also
depleted and pumping out far less water than usual.
	   Nearly two million or one-third of the population of Klang
Valley, as Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs are known, have been on
water rationing for three months.
	   Residents have to wait with pails, plastic containers, urns and
even bottles for water trucks to arrive.
	   The worst drought in decades is being blamed for the water
shortage in the city that depends mainly on rain-fed reservoirs.
But experts also say that indiscriminate logging has affected the
traditional rainfall in the area.

Indians defeat Tigers 2-0, Red Sox beat Blue Jays 9-5 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Jaret Wright pitched a three-hitter for his first
career shutout as the Cleveland Indians continued their domination
of the Detroit Tigers with a 2-0 victory Monday night.
	   Manny Ramirez homered for the Indians, who are 3-0 against
Detroit this year and 39-11 since the start of the 1994 season.
	   The Indians have won 13 of their last 17 games overall and eight
of their last nine on the road.
	   Wright (4-3) won his third straight decision, striking out seven
and walking three. The only hits he allowed were a bloop single to
Tony Clark in the second, a fifth-inning double by Frank
Catalanotto and Paul Bako's bad-hop single in the eighth.
  Red Sox 9, Blue Jays 5  
	   In Toronto, Nomar Garciaparra hit a tiebreaking home run off
Randy Myers in the ninth inning to propel the travel-weary Boston
Red Sox to their third straight win.
	   The Red Sox didn't get much rest Sunday night because bad
weather in New York delayed their flight by more than 12 hours.
	   Carlos Delgado hit two homers and drove in four runs for
Toronto.
  Devil Rays 4, Rangers 1  
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Rookie Rolando Arrojo won his eighth
game for Tampa Bay, reaching the mark faster than any pitcher for a
first-year expansion team.
	   The former Cuban national team star allowed four hits, struck
out a season-high nine and walked one in seven innings to win for
the sixth time in his last seven starts.
	   Quinton McCracken had his eighth three-hit game of the season,
including a three-run homer that broke up a scoreless pitching duel
between Arrojo (8-3) and John Burkett (3-5) in the fifth inning.
	   By getting his eighth victory in Tampa Bay's 55th game, Arrojo
became the quickest pitcher to get that many during a team's
inaugural season. Florida's Chris Hammond won his eighth in the
Marlins' 70th game in 1993.
  Orioles 10, Mariners 9  
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro hit the last of three Baltimore
home runs in the eighth inning and the Orioles overcame four
Seattle homers to defeat the Mariners.
	   The Orioles, who also finished with four homers, trailed
throughout the game before pulling ahead with a four-run eighth.
	   Brady Anderson hit a two-run homer off Bob Wells and Eric Davis,
after arguing a called strike, homered to left. One out later,
Palmeiro hit a shot off Tony Fossas (0-3) over the center-field
wall, his 13th homer of the season.
	   Palmeiro got four hits, one day after going 0-for-5 and
stranding nine runners. Roberto Alomar had four hits, including a
home run, and four RBIs.
  Yankees 5, White Sox 4, 10 innings  
	   In New York, Tim Raines scored from first on Chad Curtis' double
with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Yankees
snapped a two-game losing streak.
	   Tino Martinez went 3-for-5 with a two-run homer, and Jorge
Posada and Curtis also homered for the Yankees.
	   Matt Karchner (1-2) got the first two outs in the 10th before
walking Raines. Curtis followed by lining a 2-1 pitch into the
left-field corner that Albert Belle played off the carom as Raines
was heading into third.
	   Third-base coach Willie Randolph waved Raines around and he slid
home safely when shortstop Mike Caruso's relay throw slipped
through catcher Chad Kreuter's legs. Raines initially missed the
plate before reaching back to touch it as the Yankees came out of
the dugout to mob him.
  Angels 6, Royals 3  
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, rookie shortstop Felix Martinez
misplayed Jim Edmonds' bases-loaded ground ball in the ninth
inning, allowing two runs to score as the Anaheim Angels beat the
Royals.
	   The Angels loaded the bases with no outs against reliever
Hipolito Pichardo (2-4) on singles by Gary DiSarcina and Darin
Erstad and a controversial hit-by-pitch. Kansas City manager Tony
Muser was ejected after arguing that the ball first hit Craig
Shipley's bat as Shipley was ducking out of the way.
	   Matt Whisenant replaced Pichardo and coaxed the groundball from
Edmonds, but Martinez, playing in for a play at the plate, had the
ball roll between his legs. Tim Salmon added an RBI single for the
Angels in the ninth.
  Athletics 8, Twins 5  
	   In Minneapolis, Matt Stairs hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the
sixth inning and Oakland's bullpen preserved the lead as the
Athletics beat the Twins.
	   With Oakland trailing 4-3, Stairs hit the first pitch from
rookie Eric Milton (3-5) over the right-field fence to put the
Athletics ahead 5-4.
	   The A's made it 6-4 in the eighth on Mike Macfarlane's homer and
added two runs in the ninth on Scott Spiezio's homer and Stairs'
RBI single.
	   Despite allowing a runner to reach scoring position in the first
five innings, Mike Oquist (2-3) got the victory. He lasted 5 2-3
innings, giving up nine hits, two walks and four earned runs.
	   Buddy Groom and Mike Fetters each pitched a scoreless inning of
relief, and Billy Taylor got the final four outs for his ninth save
in 10 attempts.

Japan's finance minister hints of action to prop up yen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga expressed
``strong concern'' on Tuesday about the current level of the yen
against the U.S. dollar and warned Japan will take appropriate
action to stem its currency's fall.
	   Matsunaga declined to comment on what he sees as an appropriate
exchange rate for the American currency and the yen.
	   ``But in any case, I have strong concern about an excessively
weak yen, and we will take appropriate and decisive action against
it,'' Matsunaga told a regular news conference.
	   The dollar rose to its third straight seven-year high against
the yen in late New York overnight, trading at 139.70 yen. That's
its highest closing level since June 24, 1991, when it traded at
139.82 yen.
	   By late morning in Tokyo, Matsunaga's comments had helped push
the dollar back down to 139.53 yen.
	   While a stronger dollar makes Japan's exporters more competitive
by allowing them to cut prices overseas, it is also seen a vote of
no confidence in the Japanese economy. The dollar has gained in
recent sessions as investors sell yen to shift funds out of Japan's
moribund markets and into high-flying U.S. assets.
