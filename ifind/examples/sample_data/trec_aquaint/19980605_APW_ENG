Priest who officiated at wedding of another priest also wants to
</HEADLINE>
marry  

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Catholic priest who officiated at
the wedding of another priest has told his bishop that he too plans
to get married later this year, church officials said Friday.
	   The Rev. Jesus Siva officiated at the May 31 wedding of Hector
Canto, who defiantly wore his priest's robes when he exchanged vows
with engineer Cynthia Diamante in the town of Lambunao in central
Iloilo province.
	   Canto was defrocked after the wedding, and Siva is awaiting
punishment for having participated.
	   Now, however, because of his wedding plans, Siva will also be
asked to leave the priesthood, said Msgr. Pedro Quitorio, assistant
secretary-general of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the
Philippines.
	   Quitorio said Siva had informed the bishop of his diocese about
his desire to get married.
	   ``It leaves a bad taste in the mouth,'' Quitorio said of the
weddings.
	   He said the Church is not ``buckling'' to calls to accept
married priests.
	   Very few Filipino priests ask permission to leave the priesthood
to get married, he said.
	   ``It is a matter of the law of the Church,'' he said. ``Once a
priest does (marry) he is dismissed.''
	   A priest who wants to marry can ask permission from his bishop,
who in turn asks for dispensation from Pope John Paul II to
recognize the wedding. The priest is then asked to leave the
priesthood because of the end of his vow of celibacy.
	   If he fails to do that, the wedding is not recognized by the
Church.
	   There are about 6,000 priests in the Philippines, serving about
60 million Filipino Catholics.
	   Siva is assistant parish priest of Lambunao, about 420
kilometers (260 miles) south of Manila. Canto was assistant parish
priest of Dumangas, a town about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from
Lambunao.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado hit two-run homers
and Ed Sprague had a three-run double as the Toronto Blue Jays beat
the Detroit Tigers 9-6 on Thursday, Detroit's fifth straight
losses.
	   Woody Williams (7-2) won his fourth straight decision despite
giving up six runs and seven hits in six innings. Randy Myers
pitched the ninth for his 14th save. Brian Moehler (5-5) took the
loss.
	   Tony Clark and Damian Easley homered for Toronto.
  Athletics 6, Rangers 1  
	   In Oakland, California, Rickey Henderson homered for the third
time in as many games and Jimmy Haynes and Bill Taylor combined on
a five-hitter, leading the Athletics past the Rangers.
	   Haynes (4-2) allowed one run on five hits in 7 1-3 innings.
Taylor got five outs for his 10th save. Rick Helling (7-3) failed
in his third try for his eighth victory, allowing four runs on
eight hits in seven innings.
  White Sox 7, Royals 1  
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jamie Navarro pitched a complete game
eight-hitter and Jeff Abbott hit a three-run home run as Chicago
beat Kansas City, the White Sox's 11th straight victory at Kauffman
Stadium.
	   Navarro (5-6) snapped a personal three-game losing streak,
walking two and striking out one. He benefited from inning-ending
double plays in the first, second, sixth and seventh. Glendon Rusch
(3-8) took the loss.
  Red Sox 9, Orioles 1  
	   In Boston, Bret Saberhagen allowed one run in seven innings and

three in his longest outing of the season. Lewis went 3-for-5 with
an RBI single that put Boston ahead 3-0 in the second and his third

	   B.J. Surhoff homered for the Orioles. Sidney Ponson (0-3) took
the loss.
  Yankees 6, Devil Rays 1  
	   In New York, Hideki Irabu held Tampa Bay to one run in 7 1-3

  Indians 3, Twins 2  
	   In Minneapolis, Dwight Gooden won for the first time with
Cleveland, making Jim Thome's three-run homer stand up against
Minnesota.
	   Gooden (1-2) allowed one run and six hits in six innings,
allowing the lone run to score on Marty Cordova's second-inning
home run.
	   The 33-year-old right-hander was making his third start of the
season after opening the year on the disabled list because of
biceps tendinitis in his pitching shoulder.
	   Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 13th save.
	   Thome hit his 14th homer of the season off Brad Radke (7-4) in
the fourth. Otis Nixon also homered for Minnesota.

Philippine inflation rises to 10.3 percent in May
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS background on new consumer price index in grafs 6-9,
CORRECTS day in 1st graf to Friday

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine consumer prices rose 10.3
percent in May from a year earlier using a new base year of 1994
instead of the previous 1988, the government said Friday.
	   The consumer price index was also recalibrated to reflect
changing consumer spending patterns over the past decade, with
different weightings given to the goods and services that make up
the index. Food, beverage and tobacco continue to have the heaviest
weighting, but were reduced to 55.1 percent from 58.5 percent.
	   Using the old index, inflation in May was 9.2 percent after
April inflation was revised to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent. The
May figure was the highest since June 1996, when inflation was 9.8
percent.
	   The government has set an inflation target of between 7.5
percent and 8.5 percent for this year.
	   The government said the food, beverage and tobacco component of
the new CPI rose 8.9 percent in May from a year earlier while
services jumped 15.9 percent. Fuel, light and water rose 5.0
percent.
	   The National Statistics Office is expected to issue two separate
inflation figures until August, after which it will use only the
1994-based CPI data.
	   NSO administrator Tomas Africa earlier said the new CPI may
prompt the government to review its economic targets because of the
higher inflation figures. Inflation data are a factor in
determining interest rates and money supply.
	   ``But we are leaving that decision to the new economic team,''
said Africa, referring to the economic managers of newly elected
President Joseph Estrada, who assumes office June 30.
	   Average inflation between January and April based on the new CPI
was 8.175 percent compared with 7.2 percent under the old index.

Experts confirm suspect in Mexican police custody died of head
</HEADLINE>
wound  

<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ Forensics experts have confirmed that a
prisoner whose body was found being dumped by Mexican police on a
highway died a severe brain injury brought on by a beating.
	   The scandal that erupted after Morelos state police were caught
with the body of Jorge Nava Aviles in January forced the state
governor, Jorge Carrillo Olea, to resign last month.
	   Criminologist Alejandro Benitez told a district judge Thursday
that Nava died from grave brain inflammation, and the body had
multiple internal and external bruises indicating torture.
	   The former Morelos state attorney general and the former leader
of the state's judicial police have been accused of covering up the
killing by officers. Several other people, including top law
enforcement officials, also have been charged.
	   Former Morelos Judicial Police Chief Jesus Miyazawa admitted
knowing about the torture killing of a prisoner by his officers.
	   Miyazawa said he accompanied officers involved in the killing to
a January meeting with Carlos Peredo Meredo, then attorney general
for Morelos. Miyazawa said the prosecutor not only failed to open a
criminal investigation of the case, but told police to remove the
body from the police station and get rid of it.

Nomo traded to Mets in four-player deal
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN NADEL  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Nomomania'' is moving to the Big Apple.
	   Hideo Nomo, whose career with the Los Angeles Dodgers came to a
sudden end early this week when he was designated for assignment,
was traded to the New York Mets late Thursday in a deal involving
four right-handed pitchers.
	   Nomo will be reunited in New York with former Dodgers catcher
Mike Piazza and pitcher Masato Yoshii, a teammate with the Kintetsu
Buffaloes in Japan before Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995.
	   Nomo and Yoshii are both represented by Don Nomura.
	   The Mets will also receive 27-year-old reliever Brad Clontz, who
has been pitching for the Dodgers' Albuquerque farm club of the
Pacific Coast League. Clontz was 2-0 with a 5.66 ERA in 18 games
with the Dodgers before being farmed out last month.
	   Moving to Los Angeles are starter Dave Mlicki, who turns 30
Monday, and 31-year-old reliever Greg McMichael. Mlicki is 1-4 with
a 5.68 ERA in 10 games, all starts. McMichael is 1-2 with a 3.97
ERA in 22 games, all in relief.
	   Nomo, 29, the NL Rookie of the Year in 1995, was 2-7 with a 5.05
ERA before the Dodgers cut him loose after the Japanese pitcher
asked for a trade.
	   He has lost his last four decisions, allowing 18 earned runs in
26 2-3 innings.
	   When the Dodgers designated Nomo for assignment on Monday, that
left them with 10 days to make a move. They only needed three.
	   The trade marked another change for the Dodgers, who have a much
different look in the 2 1/2 months since the Fox Group purchased
them from the O'Malley family.
	   Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile were traded to the Florida
Marlins on May 15 for outfielders Gary Sheffield and Jim
Eisenreich, third baseman Bobby Bonilla, catcher Charles Johnson
and a minor league pitcher.
	   Piazza was traded to the Mets a week later for three prospects.
	   Nomo reportedly was unhappy about the trade of Piazza, and
apparently asked to be traded several times before Dodgers general
manager Fred Claire acted Monday.
	   Nomo's popularity among Asian fans in Los Angeles was similar to
the kind of fan support _ ``Fernandomania'' _ generated in the
Mexican community after the emergence of left-hander Fernando
Valenzuela, who pitched for the Dodgers from 1980-90.
	   Nomura met with Claire on Sunday and requested a move be made. A
day later, Claire obliged.
	   Nomo, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow
last fall, was booed during his last start as a Dodger on Saturday
during a 7-3 loss to Cincinnati in which he allowed seven hits and
six runs in 3 2-3 innings.

Mexican woman kidnapped by grandson suffocates to death

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 65-year-old woman suffocated to death after
she was gagged by a band of kidnappers, one of whom was her own
grandson, police in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo said.
	   Luz Maria Amado Palomo died Thursday while she was being held by
her 21-year-old grandson, Norberto Palomo Aguirre, and three other
young men, the government Notimex news agency quoted police as
saying.
	   The men had kidnapped the woman early Thursday and demanded a
ransom of 1 million pesos, or dlrs 115,000. The made the demand in
a telephone call from a restaurant in Pachuca, 60 miles (95
kilometers) northeast of Mexico City.
	   Police traced the call and caught the men. They then found the

  Korean president to try to forge new partnership with U.S.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung said Friday he
will seek more economic assistance and propose a new policy of
engagement toward North Korea when he meets President Clinton next
week.
	   The first opposition leader to take power in South Korea, Kim
leaves for the United States Saturday for a nine-day visit. It will
be his second overseas trip since taking office in February. He
visited London in April to attend an Asia-Europe summit.
	   ``I will stress that Korea-U.S. relations should be developed
beyond the partnership in security and trade to a new partnership
on a higher level based on a shared belief in the principles of
democracy and a free market economy,'' Kim told a nationally
televised news conference marking his first 100 days in office.
	   Kim said his talks with Clinton in Washington on June 9 will
focus on U.S. assistance to help rebuild South Korea's battered
economy and measures to lead North Korea to open its closed
communist society.
	   He also said he will appeal for U.S. and other international
investment in South Korea, whose economy was bailed out by the
International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Kim said Seoul would support any moves by the United States to
promote political and economic detente with North Korea.
	   ``As was shown in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
the engagement policy of the United States and the sunshine policy
of the new South Korean government will be more effective for North
Korea,'' he said.
	   Kim's remarks were a departure from the policy of past South
Korean governments which tried to contain North Korea rather than
engage it.
	   Inter-Korea relations remain chilly because of military and
political tensions on the peninsula. The North has shunned South
Korea as a dialogue partner while pushing vigorously to improve
ties with Washington.
	   Kim said he would not oppose a move by Washington to ease or
lift U.S. economic sanctions on North Korea.
	   Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, U.S. companies are
prohibited from doing business with North Korea. The United States
fought on South Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   ``I'm not pessimistic at all about our relations with North
Korea,'' Kim said.
	   The president said there were signs that North Korea would
change its hard-line policy toward South Korea but declined to
elaborate.
	   Kim said South Korea has largely succeeded in overcoming a
foreign exchange crisis but the country still has a long way to go
to rebuild its shattered economy.
	   To restore investor confidence, Kim said he would accelerate
reforms in the latter part of this year to restructure the economy.
	   The reforms, he said, will include faster liquidation of
financially weak banks and companies and a disintegration of South
Korea's bloated, family-oriented conglomerates, or chaebol.
	   Chaebol, which typically control 40 to 50 subsidiaries, are
largely blamed for causing South Korea's financial crisis. At least
eight of them collapsed in the past year, saddling banks with
billions of dollars in bad loans.

Nomo traded to Mets in four-player deal

  Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Fred Claire

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Nomomania'' is moving to New York.
	   Hideo Nomo, whose career with the Los Angeles Dodgers came to a
sudden end early this week when he was designated for assignment,
was traded to the New York Mets late Thursday in a deal involving
four right-handed pitchers.
	   Nomo will be reunited in New York with former Dodgers catcher

a 5.68 ERA in 10 games, all starts. McMichael is 1-2 with a 3.97
ERA in 22 games, all in relief.
	   ``I think it's an outstanding trade for us,'' Dodgers general
manager Fred Claire said. ``In Dave Mlicki, we get a starting
pitcher with outstanding ability. In Greg McMichael, we get one of
the league's top setup men.
	   ``I think we've helped our pitching staff to a large degree by
getting two experienced guys. They have experience, they have
ability, they'll fit in great.''
	   When the Dodgers designated Nomo for assignment on Monday, that
left them with 10 days to make a move. They only needed three, and
announced the deal after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2.
	   Claire said the Dodgers were contacted by 20 teams following
Monday's announcement, and that Nomo and Nomura ``were very happy''
about going to the Mets.
	   ``I spoke to Don Nomura and he was thrilled,'' Claire said. ``I
think the New York Mets were the No. 1 choice. This was a win-win
proposition for both sides.''
	   Claire said Mlicki will join the Dodgers in Seattle during a
three-game weekend series, but didn't say whether Mlicki would
pitch against the Mariners.
	   McMichael, at home in Georgia with his wife, who is expecting,
was given permission to join the team Monday in Los Angeles when it
opens a three-game series against Oakland.
	   Nomo, 29, the NL Rookie of the Year in 1995, was 2-7 with a 5.05
ERA before the Dodgers cut him loose after the Japanese pitcher
asked for a trade.
	   He has lost his last four decisions, allowing 18 earned runs in

Monday.
	   Nomo's popularity among Asian fans in Los Angeles was similar to
the kind of fan support _ ``Fernandomania'' _ received in the
Mexican community after the emergence of left-hander Fernando
Valenzuela, who pitched for the Dodgers from 1980-90.
	   Nomura met with Dodgers general manager Fred Claire on Sunday
and requested a move be made. A day later, Claire obliged.
	   Nomo, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow
last fall, was booed during his last start as a Dodger on Saturday
during a 7-3 loss to Cincinnati in which he allowed seven hits and
six runs in 3 2-3 innings.

Japan's Parliament approves ``Big Bang'' deregulation bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament approved four financial
deregulation bills Friday, intensifying the nation's ``Big Bang''
program of opening financial markets to greater competition.
	   The measures are designed to make Japanese financial
institutions more efficient and globally competitive, while
offering foreign financial companies wider access to the Japanese
market.
	   Friday's action by the upper house followed similar approval of
the four bills in the more powerful lower house last month.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told a news conference that
the enactment of the reform legislation will help create a
``favorable environment'' for Japan's economy by revitalizing the
slumping Tokyo markets and benefiting consumers as well.
	   But the Big Bang reforms, nicknamed after similar British
financial reforms in the 1980s, come at a tough time for Japan's
weakening economy.
	   Stock prices remain far below record highs, and banks and other
financial institutions are saddled with massive bad debts left over
from a 1980s speculative land price boom that went bust.
Unemployment and corporate bankruptcies are at record highs.
	   Among measures endorsed by the 252-member House of Councilors:
	   _ Non-life insurance premium rates will be liberalized starting
July 1.
	   _ Banks can sell investment trust funds from their own windows
from December 1.
	   _ A ban on trading derivatives will be lifted Dec. 1.
	   _ Brokers' commission fees will be completely liberalized by the
end of 1999, while further liberalizing sales of mutual funds and
securities.
	   _ Greater disclosure of corporate management information.
	   _ A registration system will be introduced for securities firms,
from the current license system.
	   As part of the sweeping financial deregulation program, Japan
put a revised foreign exchange law into effect on April 1, allowing
Japanese individuals and businesses for the first time to handle
foreign currencies freely.

Juneau ends Hasek's long but successful season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Just like that, the ride ended for
Dominik Hasek. It was one rebound he could not control, one
scramble in front of the net he did not win.
	   The all-world goaltender who led the Czech Republic to the
Olympic gold medal and brought the Buffalo Sabres one series
victory away from the NHL Stanley Cup Finals skated off the ice
defeated and exhausted.
	   ``Always if you lose the last game of the season, it's
disappointing,'' said Hasek after Joe Juneau scored in overtime to
give the Washington Capitals the Eastern Conference title. ``We
were close, but I have to give the Capitals credit.''
	   Brian Bellows moved around Darryl Shannon and and set up the
game-winner when he tried stuffing the puck past Hasek. Once,
twice, three times, the puck stayed in the crease before Juneau
picked it up and sent it under the fallen goaltender's glove.
	   ``I saw Juneau sneak in,'' Hasek said. ``I had a feeling he had
lots of time so I put my catching glove a little bit up. He put it
in under my glove. I knew right away it was over.''
	   It was swift, sudden, and decisive.
	   Gone was Hasek's opportunity for a rare double _ an Olympic gold
medal and a Stanley Cup. Former New York Islanders defenseman Ken
Morrow remains the only player in history to accomplish the feat.
	   After establishing a team record with 13 shutouts during the
regular season, Hasek did so only once in the playoffs. He still is
the favorite to become the first goaltender in history to be named
most valuable player in consecutive years. He's also expected to be
named top goalie for the fourth time in five years.
	   ``I was awfully nervous about Game 7 if we lost,'' Capitals
coach Ron Wilson said. ``If you had to pick a goalie for a Game 7,
it would probably be pretty unanimous that Dominik would be the
choice.''
	   Hasek played well but was beatable against the Capitals.
Washington's top line of Peter Bondra, Richard Zednik, and Andrei
Nikolishin combined for seven of Washington's 13 goals in the
series. Bondra's goal Thursday night with 5:59 remaining in the
third period sent the game to overtime.
	   ``They were probably the best line in the series,'' said Hasek,
who allowed three overtime goals in the series after giving up none
in the regular season.
	   ``You play 60 minutes, it's a tie game, you come in the locker
room and think if you get a goal you win the game,'' Hasek said.
``Unfortunately, three times they won the overtime game.
	   Buffalo had taken a 2-1 lead 7:40 into the third on Paul Kruse's
first playoff goal. In the second period, Michael Peca gave the
Sabres a 1-0 lead with 5:56 to go with his third playoff goal. Esa
Tikkanen tied the game 22 seconds later with his third.
	   ``You can't fault (Hasek) for any of the goals,'' said Sabres
coach Lindy Ruff. ``I'm extra proud of the way we played. It wasn't
meant to be.''
	   Hasek was the guy who many thought caused the offseason problems
surrounding the Sabres. He denounced former coach Ted Nolan, who
was given a one-year contract he immediately rejected.
	   He was booed at home to start the season and revered after
returning a hero in the Olympics. Almost everybody understands the
Sabres would not have been in the conference finals without Hasek.

Volcanic sea mountains could be Australia's first deep sea marine

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A recommendation to protect unique
marine life on undersea mountains south of Tasmania may lead to
Australia's first deep-sea marine protected area.
	   The recommendation follows a three-year study by Australia's
federal science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial
Research Organization, announced Friday, on the life on the
seamounts and the impact of deep sea trawling.
	   Research leader Tony Koslow said the study, on extinct undersea
volcanoes that rise 650-1,650 feet (200-500 meters) above the sea
floor at depths of 3,200-6,500 feet (1,000-2,000 meters), found a
rich diversity of life forms which were highly vulnerable to
trawling.
	   They are about 60 miles (100 km) south of Tasmania.
	   Koslow said a single research cruise found 259 species of
invertebrates such as coral, seastars and crabs, about a third of
which were new to science. About 40 percent of the new species are
thought to live only on these seamounts.
	   Thirty-seven species of fish were also found.
	   Fishing for orange roughy has occurred over shallower seamounts
in the area.
	   But the bigger mounts have never been fished, partly because of
a 1995 interim moratorium on fishing over a 143-square-mile (370
sq. km.) area that includes the bigger mounts.
	   The research showed a greatly reduced coral cover and species
variety in heavily trawled areas outside the protected region.
	   The report recommends that the interim protected area be
permanently protected from all fishing and other activities that
could disturb the sea life.
	   Neville Exon of the Australian Geological Survey Organization
said the seamounts made up the most extensive cluster known to
occur in any one place anywhere within Australia's Exclusive
Economic Zone.

Philippines  

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Muslim rebel leader and
his followers resisted his arrest by 200 government agents Friday
in a clash that left two people dead and two wounded, including a
4-month-old baby girl, officials said.
	   Police said about 200 soldiers and police were sent to the
village of Taluksangay near Zamboanga to serve an arrest warrant on
Kamlon Awolon, who faces kidnapping, extortion, murder and robbery
charges.
	   Awolon, who was expected to resist arrest, is a former commander
of the Moro National Liberation Front, which signed a peace pact
with the government in 1996.
	   Brig. Gen. Dominador Resos said Awolon and his men shot at the
arresting officers. In an exchange of gunfire, a former rebel and
the wife of another ex-rebel were killed and a 4-month-old baby
girl being carried by her mother was wounded.
	   A government agent who led the police to Awolon's house was also
wounded, police said.
	   Awolon and the rest of his men broke through the security cordon
and escaped, Resos added. They were being pursued by police, he
said.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   The government has begun peace talks with the MILF but the talks
have been put on hold until President-elect Joseph Estrada takes
office on June 30.

Vietnam floats cashew nut price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has floated the price of cashews
due to a shortage of nuts to keep processing plants running, an
executive of the Vietnam Cashew Nuts Association said Friday.
	   Cashews have been trading at 8,000 dong to 10,000 dong (62-80
cents) per kilogram (2.2 pounds), well up from the ceiling price of
6,500 dong (50 cents) set by the government, the executive said.
	   The executive, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
foreign sellers have raised their offer for raw nuts to more than
dlrs 700 per ton from dlrs 650 earlier.
	   He said the price has been pushed up because there aren't enough
cashews available to run the 60 nut-processing plants, which have a
capacity of more than 200,000 tons per year.
	   Vietnam produced about 110,000 tons in the February-May crop,
down from the average of 150,000-180,000 tons, largely because of
the country's worst drought in a century.
	   Cashews are planted only in southern Vietnam, which was
particularly parched.
	   Vietnam never has imported cashews for processing for re-export
but plans to import 30,000 tons this year to fill the shortfall.
	   Vietnam exported 33,000 processed cashew nuts last year,
fetching dlrs 133 million. About 4.5 kilograms of raw cashews can
produce one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of refined nuts.
	   The cashew association has 50 members.

Chinese police officer sentenced to death for fatal shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese court has sentenced a policeman to
death for shooting two people, one fatally, the state-run newspaper
China Youth Daily reported Friday.
	   The Intermediate Court in eastern Anhui province's Huzhou city
issued the death sentence after finding Wang Jialong guilty of
killing one man and injuring the victim's brother when he opened
fire during a streetside fracas, the report said.
	   At the request of a third party involved in a dispute with the
brothers, Wang had gone to question the men, even though the
disagreement was not in his jurisdiction, the newspaper said.
	   When they demanded that Wang show his police badge and resisted
his efforts to drag them to the police station, the policeman
became enraged and shot them, the report said.
	   The report did not say if the sentence had been carried out.

Protesters stage demonstration at US Embassy in Indonesia

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shouting ``Allah is great,'' about 100
Muslim protesters and shook the gates of the U.S. Embassy in the
capital Friday, accusing Washington of interfering in the internal
affairs of crisis-ridden Indonesia.
	   The demonstration follows similar anti-American protests in
recent days as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years
continues to spiral.
	   On Thursday, in the second largest city of Surabaya, a group
pulled down the U.S. flag from outside the U.S. consulate and tore
it up.
	   On Friday in Jakarta, a group calling themselves the ``Young
Generation for Indonesian Development'' sat outside the embassy as
a small group of police and soldiers looked on.
	   ``The United States should not intervene in our sovereignty
because we are not a beggar nation,'' said protest organizer
Mohamad Rudi.
	   The group alleged that Washington was trying to delay the
restarting of a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout plan put together
for Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund.
	   It also accused the United States government of funding
anti-government groups, a charge flatly denied by Washington.
	   An IMF team is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta on Monday to
assess Indonesia's crisis in the wake of last month's resignation
by former leader President Suharto.
	   Suharto ended 32 years of authoritarian rule on May 21 after the
world's fourth most populous nation was shaken by a wave of
protests and riots triggered by soaring inflation and mass
unemployment. An estimated 1,188 people died in the violence.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's largest Islamic nation.
	   On Thursday, visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, Stanley Roth, categorically denied that
Washington had dabbled in Indonesia's political turmoil.
	   However, he called on new President B.J. Habibie to carry on
with promises to reform Indonesia's rigid political system and to
hold free elections.
	   Roth also warned that international economic assistance for
Indonesia would be fruitless unless political stability was
established.
	   Meanwhile, American diplomats evacuated from Indonesia last
month are not going back despite a decline in violence, the State
Department said Thursday. And American travelers were advised to
avoid travel to the Southeast Asian country unless the trip is
essential.
	   Many employees of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and the U.S.
Consulate in Surabaya were evacuated in May, leaving only essential
American government workers behind. Hundreds of U.S. expatriates
and other foreigners also left the country.

Report: Japan's Fanuc to supply 390 industrial robots to Peugeot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fanuc Ltd., Japan's top machine tool maker, has
received an order for 390 industrial robots from automaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen of France, a Japanese economic newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The order, valued at several billion yen (dlrs several dozen
million), is Fanuc's first from a major French manufacturer, the
Nihon Keizai quoted company officials as saying.
	   Fanuc officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Beginning in September, Fanuc will deliver robots for welding,
conveying and processing to a Citroen plant in Rennes.
	   Peugeot wants to introduce a large number of robots to step up
plant automation in an effort to survive increasingly stiff
competition in the European auto industry, analysts said.

India studying demands by five nuclear powers
</HEADLINE>
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By ASHOK SHARMA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Friday was closely studying
demands by the five original nuclear powers that it and Pakistan
give up their nuclear ambitions and instead sit down together to
resolve issues fueling their rivalry, including the dispute over
the border region of Kashmir.
	   India will give its response after ``closely examining'' the
Thursday's joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States, the Press Trust of
India news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh as
saying.
	   Last month India conducted a series of nuclear tests, citing its
fear of Pakistan and China. Pakistan responded with its own tests,
setting off fears the long-standing South Asian rivalry could
culminate with nuclear war.
	   Meeting Thursday in Geneva, the foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council offered to help
India and Pakistan resolve their differences, especially their
competing claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   But the main responsibility for making peace is theirs, said
Tang Jiaxuan of China, who chaired the meeting.
	   New Delhi has in the past rejected any outside pressure to
settle the Kashmir dispute, the flash point of two of India's three
wars with Pakistan in the past 50 years. Pakistan, though, has
pressed for it to be taken up in international fora, believing it
is at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its larger and more
powerful neighbor.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Parliament on
Thursday that his government was prepared to discuss the
contentious issue bilaterally with Pakistan.
	   The Geneva statement also asked India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without conditions.
	   Soon after conducting its tests, India said it planned no more
but wouldn't sign the treaty in its present form because it allows
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to keep their
nuclear arsenals.
	   Pakistan, which responded with nuclear tests of its own, says it
will sign the CTBT only if India adhered to it.
	   Though India and Pakistan now claim to be capable of building
nuclear bombs, the five nations who were the first to perfect
weapons of mass destruction refused to welcome any new members into
their club, the U.N. Security Council.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters they
could not let any other nation on the nuclear threshold believe it
``can test its way in.''
	   Pakistan and India, Albright and the other ministers said,
should refrain from any more tests, from building or deploying
nuclear weapons, or from testing missiles to carry nuclear bombs.
Many fear the next stage of the costly, potentially catastrophic
South Asian nuclear arms race will be developing delivery systems.
	   The ministers did not threaten sanctions, which the United
States has been alone among the five in imposing.
	   Sanctions only hurt the people and neighboring countries and
``have little effect on leaders who often act in isolation and
sometimes unpredictably,'' said Russia's Yevgeny Primakov.

Nomo traded to Mets in four-player deal
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Nomura, Phillips quotes  
  By JOHN NADEL  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``Nomomania'' is moving to New York.
	   Hideo Nomo, whose career with the Los Angeles Dodgers came to a
sudden end early this week when he was designated for assignment,
was traded to the New York Mets late Thursday in a deal involving
four right-handed pitchers.
	   Nomo will be reunited in New York with former Dodgers catcher
Mike Piazza and pitcher Masato Yoshii, a teammate with the Kintetsu
Buffaloes in Japan before Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995.
	   Nomo and Yoshii are both represented by Don Nomura.
	   The Mets will also receive 27-year-old reliever Brad Clontz, who
has been pitching for the Dodgers' Albuquerque farm club of the
Pacific Coast League. Clontz was 2-0 with a 5.66 ERA in 18 games
with the Dodgers before being farmed out last month.
	   Moving to Los Angeles are starter Dave Mlicki, who turns 30
Monday, and 31-year-old reliever Greg McMichael. Mlicki is 1-4 with
a 5.68 ERA in 10 games, all starts. McMichael is 1-2 with a 3.97
ERA in 22 games, all in relief.
	   ``I think it's an outstanding trade for us,'' Dodgers general
manager Fred Claire said. ``In Dave Mlicki, we get a starting
pitcher with outstanding ability. In Greg McMichael, we get one of
the league's top setup men.
	   ``I think we've helped our pitching staff to a large degree by
getting two experienced guys. They have experience, they have
ability, they'll fit in great.''
	   When the Dodgers designated Nomo for assignment on Monday, that
left them with 10 days to make a move. They only needed three, and
announced the deal after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2.
	   Claire said the Dodgers were contacted by 20 teams following
Monday's announcement, and that Nomo and Nomura ``were very happy''
about going to the Mets.
	   ``He's very excited to become a Met,'' Nomura said. ``The Mets
are one of the teams he's wanted to play for.''
	   Said Mets general manager Steve Phillips: ``The obvious
questions are about his health and performance this year. Once we
looked at eveything, we were easily able to work up a justifcation
for bringing him in and expecting him to do well.''
	   Claire said Mlicki will join the Dodgers in Seattle during a
three-game weekend series, but didn't say whether Mlicki would
pitch against the Mariners.
	   McMichael was given permission to join the team Monday in Los
Angeles when it opens a three-game series against Oakland.
	   Nomo, 29, the NL Rookie of the Year in 1995, was 2-7 with a 5.05
ERA before the Dodgers cut him loose after the Japanese pitcher
asked for a trade.
	   He has lost his last four decisions, allowing 18 earned runs in
26 2-3 innings.
	   The trade marked another change for the Dodgers, who have a much
different look in the 2 1/2 months since the Fox Group purchased
them from the O'Malley family.
	   Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile were traded to the Florida
Marlins on May 15 for outfielders Gary Sheffield and Jim
Eisenreich, third baseman Bobby Bonilla, catcher Charles Johnson
and a minor league pitcher.
	   Piazza was traded to the Mets a week later for three prospects.
	   Nomo reportedly was unhappy about the trade of Piazza, and
apparently asked to be traded several times before Claire acted
Monday.
	   Nomo's popularity among Asian fans in Los Angeles was similar to
the kind of fan support _ ``Fernandomania'' _ received in the
Mexican community after the emergence of left-hander Fernando
Valenzuela, who pitched for the Dodgers from 1980-90.
	   Nomura met with Dodgers general manager Fred Claire on Sunday
and requested a move be made. A day later, Claire obliged.
	   Nomo, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow
last fall, was booed during his last start as a Dodger on Saturday
during a 7-3 loss to Cincinnati in which he allowed seven hits and
six runs in 3 2-3 innings.

Man jailed 15 years for slavery, rape of wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A man convicted of enslaving,
raping and torturing his wife for more than four years was
sentenced Friday by the High Court to serve 15 years in jail.
	   The man, a 31-year-old former bus driver and pastor, was found
guilty last month after a two-week trial. He had denied all counts.
	   The court has suppressed publication of his name and the names
of his wife and children.
	   During the trial, prosecutor Richard Marchant said the woman,
now 24, was held in ``two homes of horror'' for four years until
she escaped in March 1997.
	   The woman testified that she was confined in her room with her
three children for up to 22 hours a day.
	   She said she had boiling water poured over her, had salt rubbed
in her wounds, had her head rammed against a door jamb and
cigarettes stubbed out on her.
	   The man maintained his innocence and claimed the injuries were
caused when he tried to prevent the woman from harming herself.
	   The High Court sentenced the man to concurrent 10-year terms on
slavery and rape charges, and added additional sentences ranging
from five years to one year on 12 other charges involving violent
offenses.
	   The judge said the case brought to public attention the issue of
battered women's syndrome, which was still not widely understood
despite being accepted by the courts in recent years.
	   Justice Tony Randerson said the man had regarded the woman as
his personal property and had exercised almost total control over
her.
	   ``It is hard to credit that this state of affairs could exist in
a modern society.'' he said.
	   The judge said the psychiatric report noted that the man had not
accepted the jury's verdicts against him and had failed to show any
remorse.
	   The prosecutor said the woman and her children had been
undergoing counseling and she was ``freaking out'' over the freedom
she now had to do even simple things.

Indonesia announces details of privatization plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Battling to overcome massive financial
problems, the Indonesian government Friday named U.S. investment
banks Goldman Sachs and Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as
overall advisers on the partial privatization of 12 state-owned
companies.
	   State-owned Companies Minister Tanri Abeng also named a list of
investment banks to assist in the sale of the 12 companies
individually.
	   The minister said 22 international institutions and 17 domestic
securities firms had submitted proposals for the sales.
	   The sell-off is in line with the terms of a dlrs 43 billion
economic bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund.
	   An IMF team is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta next week with a
view to restarting the bailout in the wake of political turmoil and
riots that climaxed last month with the resignation of ex-President
Suharto.
	   Under the IMF deal, Indonesia agreed to divest its holdings in
12 state companies to a minimum of 51 percent. Five of the
companies, PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, PT Indosat, PT Tambang
Timah, PT Aneka Tambang and PT Semen Gresik are listed on the
Jakarta Stock Exchange.
	   Merrill Lynch and Co. and Lehman Brothers were appointed as
advisers on the Telkom sale, while Goldman Sachs will advise on the
sale of Indosat.
	   Lehman Brothers was also appointed as adviser for toll road
operator PT Jasa Marga, and Goldman Sachs for port operator PT
Pelabuhan Indonesia II.
	   Credit Suisse First Boston was named as adviser to port operator
PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III.
	   Jardine Fleming will advise on listed cement producer PT Semen
Gresik and plantation company PT Perkebunan Nusantara IV.
	   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co. and Paribas will jointly
advise on the partial privatization on all the state mining
companies: coal company PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam, gold
company PT Aneka Tambang and tin miner PT Tambang Timah.
	   UBS/SBC Warburg Dillon Reed will advise on airport-management
company PT Angkasa Pura II.
	   Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Travelers Group Inc. of the
U.S., will advise on PT Kratakau Steel.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years.
	   The confirmed death toll rose to 95 after rescue crews recovered
two additional bodies early Friday from the last major part of
wreckage to be excavated, a dining car that was buried when an
overpass collapsed during Wednesday's pileup.
	   Police spokesman Peter Hoppe said rescuers did not expect to
find additional bodies.
	   State authorities originally had estimated that as many as 100
or more were killed when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884
derailed near the small town of Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles)
north of Hanover.
	   There has been no indication of human error, but a break in a
wheel is emerging as the possible cause of the accident, said Horst
Stuchly, president of the federal railway office.
	   After jumping the tracks at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour,
the ICE crashed into part of the bridge and sparked a smash-up of
train cars.
	   ``I remember only that people and seats were all over the
place,'' an unidentified woman told n-tv television in one of the
first interviews with one of the scores of injured survivors
evacuated to hospitals in helicopters.
	   ``A glass pane fell on me, and I was lying on top of somebody,
and all around was chaos,'' said the bandaged woman, speaking
softly from a hospital bed. ``As I later lay there in silence, the
door was open and I watched the sky, until the first helicopter
came.''
	   State officials said 200 people were injured, of whom 95 were
treated in hospitals.
	   Ninety-two bodies were recovered at the scene, and three people
had died in hospitals.
	   Rescue crews managed to reach parts of the dining car only after
carefully lifting a huge chunk of the collapsed concrete bridge
with cranes overnight.
	   Some train parts remained under the bridge, but not an entire
first-class car as previously had been reported, and no additional
bodies were expected, officials said.
	   Further excavation of the bridge was halted until later Friday
to give exhausted crews a break, crisis management spokesman Klaus
Weswe said.
	   Deutsche Bahn said it was removing all 60 of its
first-generation InterCity Express trains, introduced in 1991, from
service after they finished their runs Thursday, idling more than
half of the nation's fastest trains.
	   Forty-three trains built since 1996 remained in service. It was
unclear how quickly normal service would resume.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said.
	   Earlier, officials had lowered the speed limit for all ICE
trains from 280 kilometers (175 miles) per hour to 160 kph (100
mph) until the entire fleet could be inspected.
	   There were one- to three-hour delays Thursday along the
2,175-mile ICE system, which links Germany's key cities and give
business commuters a convenient alternative to the country's
clogged autobahns.
	   A spokeswoman for the federal transport ministry told The
Associated Press that a broken wheel on the first car behind the
lead locomotive may have been a factor in the accident. She did not
elaborate.
	   Stuchly also cited a broken wheel, and said that part of the
train derailed 300 meters (yards) before the train reached the
overpass.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found on the track
six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no
details on the parts and were uncertain whether they were from the
crashed train.
	   Officials said it appeared that the fifth car of the 12-car
train hit the bridge as it went through. The back end of the car
was broken off; the fourth car veered off the rails and rolled onto
its side, while three other cars jackknifed further up the line.
	   The lead locomotive remained on the tracks and the driver
apparently was unaware of the incident, coming to a stop only after
the station master at Eschede activated an emergency brake. The
rest of the train was squashed beneath or against the collapsed
overpass.
	   Officials said a detailed, forensic investigation would begin
only after all victims had been removed the debris.
	   Authorities set up a reception center for worried relatives in a
sports hall in Eschede. The window shades were drawn and a sign
warning ``No Press'' was attached to plastic sheets covering the
door.
	   Bodies and body parts were taken to Hanover for identification.
	   ``I've never seen so many injured, so much destruction and so
many dead. I believe this is what all of us are experiencing,''
Rev. Cristoph Kuenkel told a few hundred people who gathered
Thursday evening for a memorial service at the town's Lutheran
church, the Johanniskirche.
	   Germany's deadliest train accident prior to Wednesday's
derailment came in 1967, when 94 people were killed after a barrier
closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline, causing it to
explode.

World Cup ticket company faces closure after fans receive no
</HEADLINE>
tickets

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A company that has taken 2.4 million pounds (dlrs
3.9 million) selling tickets to the World Cup soccer tournament,
but has failed to deliver all the tickets, faced closure Friday
after a court-appointed liquidator took it over.
	   London-based Great Portland Entertainments Ltd. sold 40,000
seats to fans wanting to see England and Scotland play in the
tournament, which gets under way in France later this month, but a
court appointed an official receiver Thursday after the government
stepped in when fans did not receive tickets they had paid for.
	   ``We became aware that the tickets had not been delivered by the
dates promised and so we took action to stop the company trading,''
said a spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``They were taking orders for tickets to all the England and
Scotland matches, but the company was not an authorized supplier of
World Cup tickets and the tickets have not materialized,'' the
spokesman said. ``We will not know if fans will get their money
back until the official receiver has investigated the company.''
	   It is not yet known how many fans have not received tickets they
paid for.
	   The Daily Telegraph reported Friday that the company is believed
to have obtained up to 17,000 tickets for the tournament and that
it is reported to have charged up to 500 pounds (dlrs 820) for a
25-pound (dlrs 40) ticket.
	   The court-appointed liquidator will take charge of the company
until a hearing scheduled for July 22.
	   The issue of World Cup tickets for British fans has been
controversial, with fans complaining they have not been able to
obtain enough tickets through official channels.
	   A French court is expected to rule Friday on a complaint by
British members of the European Parliament that the ticketing
arrangements for the tournament violate European legislation.

Japan approves law to allow troops more peacekeeping activity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan approved Friday a bill that would revise its
current peacekeeping law to expand the international peacekeeping
activities of the nation's military.
	   The law, approved by the upper house of Parliament, is scheduled
to take effect next month. The revision was already passed by the
more powerful lower house in May.
	   Under the revised Peacekeeping Law, Japanese troops can be sent
to a disputed area where there is no ceasefire, which is banned
under the current law.
	   The revision also allows the nation's military, called the
Self-Defense Forces, to participate in election monitoring
organized by various organizations other than the United Nations,
the only organization under which Japan can send its troops
according to the current law.
	   Japan has sent members of its Self-Defense Forces to Cambodia,
Mozambique, Zaire and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights under the
1992 law that permitted Japanese troops to go abroad for the first
time since its defeat in World War II _ but only for peacekeeping
missions and never for combat.
	   Opposition lawmakers and pacifist activists criticized the law
as a step toward the nation's military expansion overseas.
	   Japan's postwar pacifist Constitution prohibits use of military
force as a means of settling international disputes.
	   Also, unlike the current law that left the decision to use
weapons for self-defense up to individual soldiers, the revision
gives a troop commander the right to make decisions for his entire
men in case of danger.

North Korea says no missing Japanese in its territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea said Friday a lengthy
investigation found no evidence that missing Japanese citizens are
in its territory, despite allegations of kidnappings by its agents.
	   Acting on Japanese requests, North Korea's Red Cross and
government have conducted an ``intensive'' five-month search for 10
missing Japanese since early this year, said the North's official
Korean Central News Agency.
	   But none of those sought by Japan was found, a North Korean Red
Cross spokesman told KCNA.
	   ``The results of the search finally proved that the persons
wanted by Japan do not exist in the (North Korean) territory and
that they never entered nor temporarily stayed here,'' the
spokesman said.
	   The status of the 10 missing Japanese is a key pending issue
between Japan and North Korea, which have no diplomatic ties.
	   Talks aimed at normalizing Tokyo-Pyongyang relations have
stalled over the issue of the missing persons. Japan believes that
North Korean agents abducted the Japanese, including a 13-year-old
girl, over the past two decades to use them as language teachers
for their spies.
	   North Korea has dismissed the alleged kidnappings as ``faked-up
cases.''
	   But during talks with a delegation of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's ruling coalition last November, Pyongyang's ruling
(communist) Workers Party agreed to launch an investigation.
	   Police and other officials conducted the search throughout North
Korea ``in a responsible way from the humanitarian point of view,''
the Red Cross spokesman told KCNA.
	   They investigated the personal data of all foreign citizens
staying in North Korea and naturalized people as well as their
families overseas, comparing them with identities of the 10 people
sought by Japan, he said.
	   North Korea resents Japan's colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, support for the United States in the
1950-53 Korean War, and close ties to the rival South Korean
government.
	   After tortuous negotiations, North Korea allowed 15 Japanese
women married to North Korean men to visit Japan late last year and
early this year. Their visits were the first of their kind.
	   On Friday, North Korea demanded that the Japanese Red Cross help
find out the fates of many Korean women forced to work as sex
slaves in front-line brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army
during World War II.

Scientists may have found some of the universe's `missing mass'
</HEADLINE>

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An international team of scientists working from a
revamped mineshaft in central Japan said Friday they may have
unlocked one of the biggest mysteries of physics _ evidence that an
infinitesimally small subatomic particle called the neutrino has
mass.
	   The finding would be revolutionary because it would force
physicists to rethink a central theory of modern science: That the
universe began expanding at the Big Bang and will keep expanding
forever.
	   The Super-Kamiokande Experiment research team, a group of 120
scientists from around the world, presented their findings Friday
at a physics conference in Takayama, a city in central Japan.
	   The findings had the physicists almost giddy.
	   `I think they have definitely made a discovery,'' said Paul
Langacker, chairman of the department of physics and astronomy at
the University of Pennsylvania.
	   He said he has never seen physicists so excited about a
discovery in his 20-year career.
	   ``Everybody just senses that this is a winner and that it's
right,'' he said.
	   But Arthur McDonald, who is professor of physics at Queen's
University in Kingston, Ontario and heads another team conducting
similar research, cautioned that it will take time to verify the
Japanese results.
	   Neutrinos are one of nature's basic building blocks but they are
very tricky to track. They have no charge and are so small that
they pass right through matter.
	   The Kamiokande group, which includes researchers from Japan, the
United States, Germany and Poland, used a 50,000-ton tank filled
with purified water to catch a glimpse of some of the trillions of
particles that pass through the earth every second.
	   Collisions between neutrinos and atoms in the tank create a
spark detected by equipment surrounding the tank. The equipment was
buried in a kilometer (half-mile) of rock to block cosmic rays and
radiation.
	   Though the scientists have not measured neutrino mass, they say
they detected that some neutrinos oscillate, or change type, as
they pass through space or matter. A widely accepted theory says
anything that oscillates must have mass.
	   ``We are very confident that this proves it,'' said Chang Kee
Jung, member of the project team and a professor of Physics and
Astronomy from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
	   Physics' ``standard model'' theory of how fundamental particles
work decrees that neutrinos should weigh nothing at all.
	   But if the findings presented Friday can be repeated
independently, researchers say they'll have firm evidence the
theory needs to be reconsidered.
	   ``This is definitely something new beyond our standard theory,''
said the University of Pennsylvania's Langacker.
	   Langacker said he believes the finding will eventually give more
credence to the unified theory.
	   The unified theory is an effort to combine in one set of
mathematical equations all of the fundamental forces in nature:
gravity; electromagnetic energy, such as light; and the
interactions between subatomic particles.
	   The concept was first proposed by Albert Einstein. The search
for a unified theory has failed so far because of uncertainties _
such as the mass of neutrinos.
	   Neutrino mass could help explain why astonomers can't find 90
percent of the matter that's supposed to exist in the universe.
	   Given the speed at which the universe is expanding, physicists
think the universe should be of a certain mass. But when they add
up the weight of the planets, stars and all other known stuff in
the cosmos they get a number only 10 percent as large as their
theory predicts.
	   That inconsistency has lead many to conclude either that much
more of the universe is hidden in mysterious dark spots or that the
theory is seriously flawed.
	   The mass of an individual neutrino is perhaps billions of times
less than an electron, the particle with the smallest known mass.
But together all the neutrinos could account for a big part the
universe's mysteriously missing mass.
	   If the universe has enough mass, it must contract at some point
because of the pull of its own gravity.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado hit two-run homers
and Ed Sprague had a three-run double as the Toronto Blue Jays beat
the Detroit Tigers 9-6 on Thursday, Detroit's fifth straight
losses.
	   Woody Williams (7-2) won his fourth straight decision despite
giving up six runs and seven hits in six innings. Randy Myers
pitched the ninth for his 14th save. Brian Moehler (5-5) took the
loss.
	   Tony Clark and Damian Easley homered for Toronto.
  Athletics 6, Rangers 1  
	   In Oakland, California, Rickey Henderson homered for the third
time in as many games and Jimmy Haynes and Bill Taylor combined on
a five-hitter, leading the Athletics past Texas.
	   Haynes (4-2) allowed one run on five hits in 7 1-3 innings.
Taylor got five outs for his 10th save. Rick Helling (7-3) failed
in his third try for his eighth victory, allowing four runs on
eight hits in seven innings.
  White Sox 7, Royals 1  
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Jamie Navarro pitched a complete game
eight-hitter and Jeff Abbott hit a three-run home run as Chicago
beat Kansas City, the White Sox's 11th straight victory at Kauffman
Stadium.
	   Navarro (5-6) snapped a personal three-game losing streak,
walking two and striking out one. He benefited from inning-ending
double plays in the first, second, sixth and seventh. Glendon Rusch
(3-8) took the loss.
  Red Sox 9, Orioles 1  
	   In Boston, Bret Saberhagen allowed one run in seven innings and
Darren Lewis drove in three runs as Boston rebounded from its only
shutout loss of the season with a victory over Baltimore.
	   Saberhagen (7-3) allowed seven hits, walked one and struck out
three in his longest outing of the season. Lewis went 3-for-5 with
an RBI single that put Boston ahead 3-0 in the second and his third
homer of the season, a two-run shot that made it 5-0 in the sixth.
	   B.J. Surhoff homered for the Orioles. Sidney Ponson (0-3) took
the loss.
  Yankees 6, Devil Rays 1  
	   In New York, Hideki Irabu held Tampa Bay to one run in 7 1-3
innings and Bernie Williams was 3-for-4 with two RBIs as New York
beat the expansion Devil Rays to extend its winning streak to four
games.

Dollar climbs above 139 yen on rumors, stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed back above 139.00 yen
Friday, bought on a series of unfounded rumors about crises in the
Japanese political and financial world. Tokyo stocks finished the
day's trading lower.
	   The dollar bought 139.24 yen, up 1.08 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 138.27 yen
overnight.
	   The dollar held firm throughout the day through cross trading,
in which foreign and Japanese institutional investors bought the
German mark against the yen, after fresh data showed robust German
economic performance in the first quarter.
	   But traders said the dollar's advance was accelerated when
several groundless rumors circulated in Tokyo around midday,
prompting U.S. hedge funds and Japanese trust funds to buy the U.S.
currency.
	   One of the rumors was that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may
resign on charges of receiving illegal political donations when he
was finance minister, and another that a Japanese long-term credit
bank might go bankrupt.
	   ``The rumors seem totally unfounded, but nonetheless provided
another reason for players to close dollar-short positions,'' said
Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank.
	   Earlier in the morning, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said
finance authorities will carefully watch the dollar-yen rate, and
if necessary may make the yen's weakness a topic of discussion at
the G-7 meeting.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, pessimism over Japan's economy
continued to weigh on sentiment, traders said, in continued light
activity.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 103.04 points,
or 0.67 percent, closing the week at 15,323.43 points. On Thursday,
the index had gained 79.47 points, or 0.52 percent.
	   On Thursday, Mitsui Wharf Co., a harbor-transport company,
applied to the Yokohama District Court for protection from
creditors, increasing pessimism about the health of Japan's
companies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,201.94.
The TOPIX closed up 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.160 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.135 percent, driving its price down to 112.35 yen from 112.54
yen.

India studying demands by five nuclear powers
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: SUBS 12th graf to CORRECT that club defined by
nonproliferation treaty sted UN Security Council.  
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By ASHOK SHARMA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Friday was closely studying
demands by the five original nuclear powers that it and Pakistan
give up their nuclear ambitions and instead sit down together to
resolve issues fueling their rivalry, including the dispute over
the border region of Kashmir.
	   India will give its response after ``closely examining'' the
Thursday's joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States, the Press Trust of
India news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh as
saying.
	   Last month India conducted a series of nuclear tests, citing its
fear of Pakistan and China. Pakistan responded with its own tests,
setting off fears the long-standing South Asian rivalry could
culminate with nuclear war.
	   Meeting Thursday in Geneva, the foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council offered to help
India and Pakistan resolve their differences, especially their
competing claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   But the main responsibility for making peace is theirs, said
Tang Jiaxuan of China, who chaired the meeting.
	   New Delhi has in the past rejected any outside pressure to
settle the Kashmir dispute, the flash point of two of India's three
wars with Pakistan in the past 50 years. Pakistan, though, has
pressed for it to be taken up in international fora, believing it
is at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its larger and more
powerful neighbor.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Parliament on
Thursday that his government was prepared to discuss the
contentious issue bilaterally with Pakistan.
	   The Geneva statement also asked India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without conditions.
	   Soon after conducting its tests, India said it planned no more
but wouldn't sign the treaty in its present form because it allows
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to keep their
nuclear arsenals.
	   Pakistan, which responded with nuclear tests of its own, says it
will sign the CTBT only if India adhered to it.
	   Though India and Pakistan now claim to be capable of building
nuclear bombs, the five nations who were the first to perfect
weapons of mass destruction refused to welcome any new members into
their club of nuclear powers, as defined by the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.

Israeli doctors petition Supreme Court to deem tobacco ``dangerous
</HEADLINE>
drug''  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Nicotine and tobacco should be declared and
treated as a ``dangerous drugs,'' Israeli doctors and citizens
allegedly sickened or killed by cigarettes said in a petition filed
to the Supreme Court.
	   ``We are saying that nicotine and tobacco are dangerous drugs no
less addictive than heroine or cocaine,'' said Shlomo Erdman, the
lawyer who filed the petition Thursday on behalf of the Israeli
Medical Association, citing a similar 1988 declaration by the U.S.
Surgeon General.
	   In the petition, the Israeli Medical Association has asked the
judges to instruct the Health Ministry to clamp down restrictions
on the production and marketing of cigarettes and other tobacco
products as they would on any other health threatening substance.
	   The IMA has been forced to turn to the courts for a ruling on
the matter in light of strong resistance it has encountered by the
powerful tobacco lobby in Israel's legislature, Erdman said.
	   ``Because of the economic interests posed by the tobacco
companies we see the Knesset is not dealing with the issue so we
are turning to the court to force the Health Ministry to take
action,'' said Erdman.
	   Also targeted in the petition is the Israeli cigarette
manufacturer Dubek as well as overseas cigarette manufacturers and
importers.
	   The IMA seeks limit the importation and distribution of
cigarettes as a dangerous substance in an attempt to reduce smoking
among Israelis overall.
	   According to the IMA some 5,000 Israelis die every year from
smoking related illnesses and the habit costs the economy over 500
million dollars a year in lost work days and damage caused by fires
started by cigarettes.
	   Twenty-eight percent of Israel's 5.6 million citizens smoke.
	   A spokesman for the the Health Ministry said the petition was
under review and no comment was available.

Long ostracized, Indonesian Chinese found political party
</HEADLINE>
  With Indonesia-US
  AP Photo JAK103-104
  By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Emboldened by the new openness
sweeping Indonesia, a group of ethnic Chinese launched a political
party Friday to battle the ostracism they have suffered for
decades.
	   The Chinese minority has long been a scapegoat in Indonesia,
largely because it dominates the economy. Last month, rioters angry
over price increases burned and looted hundreds of Chinese shops in
Jakarta, the capital, and other big cities.
	   But with Indonesia's new government pledging democratic reform,
a small coalition of Chinese entrepreneurs said that now was the
time to carve out a political niche. Chinese make up only 4 percent
of Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   ``All of us have to rise, to defend our rights,'' said Ponijan
Liaw, a language school director and a founder of the Indonesian
Chinese Reform Party. At a news conference, organizers said they
planned to back their own candidates in general elections which new
President B.J. Habibie has said he will stage next year.
	   It was a startling turnabout from Chinese who kept a low profile
under former authoritarian leader Suharto, ousted last month amid
riots and student protests that were fueled by Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in decades. Many other political parties are
springing up in the new climate of freedom.
	   Anxious to avoid ethnic conflict, Suharto suppressed the Chinese
minority's culture, banning Chinese New Year celebrations and
newspapers and closing down their schools in the 1960s.
	   At the same time, the president crafted close ties with wealthy
Chinese tycoons, helping his children build business empires which
now face corruption allegations.
	   ``Not all of us are economic animals,'' Liaw said. ``Just
because of a few conglomerates which colluded with the government,
we get the blame as scapegoats.''
	   The new party wants to promote harmony between Chinese and
indigenous Indonesians, and although anybody can join, its ethnic
exclusivity may hinder the task.
	   The party ideology is based on Pancasila, the national
philosophy enshrined in the 1945 constitution, which mandates a
belief in God and respect for democracy and social justice.
	   A Chinese political party existed early this century under Dutch
colonial rule, but political participation faded after Suharto, a
former army general, rose to power.
	   ``We realize we're a minority, but it's better to do something
than nothing,'' said Julianus Juta, a computer scientist and
co-founder of the new Chinese party. ``We just want the goverment
to treat us fairly.''

  APEC adopts mutual recognition for telecoms equipment
  By LAURINDA KEYS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations on Friday adopted
cross-border acceptance of testing for all telecommunications
equipment as a way to lower the costs and time involved in bringing
new products to the market.
	   The Mutual Recognition Arrangement, adopted by government
ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, is the
industry's first such agreement.
	   It allows already tested and certified products to be exported
without requirements for retesting in the import country and will
speed up marketing of technologies that are rapidly changing.
	   The agreement ``will boost trade in telecommunications and
information equipment goods among members of APEC, affecting
roughly dlrs 45 billion in current trade flows, or one-third of the
global market,'' the the U.S. Trade Representative office said in a
statement from Washington, D.C.

Korean prosecutors indict two former top officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors indicted two top economic
advisers to former President Kim Young-sam on Friday for allegedly
lying to cover up their mishandling of South Korea's economy.
	   Former Finance Minister Kang Kyong-shik and former presidential
economic secretary Kim In-ho were arrested and jailed in mid-May
pending trial.
	   Wrapping up a two-month investigation, prosecutors said Friday
they have found enough evidence to charge that the two lied to the
ex-president about the severity of the nation's financial problems.
	   Their indictment was expected to be followed later this year by
a separate parliamentary probe into the origins of the collapse of
what had been the world's 11th-largest economy.
	   The two denied the charges of negligence, arguing that they kept
their boss properly informed and a policy failure or misjudgment
cannot be subject to criminal punishment.
	   Charges against the two ex-presidential aides also included
influence-peddling in connection with millions of dollars in
preferential bank loans extended to three insolvent companies last
year.
	   If found guilty, they could face a prison term of up to three
years.
	   Both were fired two days before South Korea was forced to accept
a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund from the International Monetary Fund
late last year.
	   Prosecutors said that inefficiency and negligence of duty by
officials had worsened the crisis.
	   They said former President Kim was kept in the dark about the
full scale of the financial crisis and was warned of its severity
by sources outside his presidential Blue House.
	   The new government of President Kim Dae-jung, inaugurated in
February, openly held the two former aides responsible for the
economic collapse.
	   Thousands of South Korean companies have collapsed since then,
driving more than 1.5 million people out of their jobs.

	   The APEC telecommunications and information ministers released a
declaration specifying dates for 16 of the 18 member nations to put
the agreement into effect.
	   Chile and New Zealand indicated that their regulations for
telecommunications equipment are simple enough that they do not
need to change them.
	   Testing and certification are expensive procedures for
exporters, importers and regulators, and those costs are often
passed to buyers and users. Simplified procedures reduce costs.
	   ``At the same time, regulators need to have confidence in the
quality of testing that provides the basis for certification of
equipment,'' the U.S. Trade Representative said.
	   The Mutual Recognition Arrangement sets up a framework for that
confidence to be given, and provides remedies for when something
goes wrong.
	   The arrangement covers all equipment subject to
telecommunication regulations, including wireline and wireless,
terrestrial and satellite equipment.
	   The agreement is part of a voluntary liberalization process that
APEC leaders launched last November in Vancouver.
Telecommunications is one of the nine sectors targeted for early
action in the first half of this year.
	   APEC trade ministers will meet in Kuching, Malaysia, on June
22-23 to discuss the remaining eight target sectors: environmental
goods and services, medical equipment and instruments, chemicals,
energy sector, forest products, fish, gems and jewelry, and toys.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Candidate members are Russia, Vietnam and Peru.

Yeltsin promises to hold down inflation, but urges Russians to pay
</HEADLINE>
taxes  
  By MAURA REYNOLDS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin promised his countrymen
Friday that he won't let Russia's financial crisis fuel new
inflation, but said they must be prepared to do something in
return: pay their taxes.
	   ``The financial crisis threatens to destabilize the Russian
ruble,'' Yeltsin warned in his weekly radio address to the nation.
``And that means a return to rising prices and a higher cost of
living. That is something we simply can't allow.''
	   But Yeltsin said that unless Russian businesses and individuals
start accepting their responsibility to pay taxes, there could be a
return to Soviet-style ration cards and lines in the stores.
	   ``The government exists on the money paid by taxpayers,'' he
said. ``And you are right to demand effective work from the
executive, legislative and judicial powers.''
	   ``But the government is right to expect citizens to have a
responsible attitude to their obligation to pay taxes
voluntarily.''
	   Russia's financial crisis has eased this week, in part because
the government has taken aggressive actions to raise revenue,
including a surprise bond offering and issuing extremely short-term
treasury bills.
	   In a sign of confidence, the Central Bank lowered two key
interest rates late Thursday after hiking them to an unprecedented
150 percent last week.
	   All the same, the new rates of 60 percent are still double what
they were before the crisis intensified two weeks ago. And while
the stock market has gained this week, it is still down about 50
percent since the beginning of the year.
	   Russia's tax collection troubles are at the heart of the crisis.
The country's new tax chief has said that fewer than 3 percent of
Russian citizens filed income tax declarations last year, and tax
evasion is the norm among Russian businesses.
	   ``The time has come to demand and punish, including filing
criminal charges,'' Yeltsin said ominously. ``If we don't collect
taxes, we can't pay salaries.''
	   The government's chronic inability to pay wages to state workers
has led to labor protests, including strikes by coal miners last
month that shut down parts of the country's rail system.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan off-cutter Kumara Dharmasena
rocked New Zealand with three quick wickets to leave the tourists
with a lunch time total of 162 for 8 on the third day of the second
Test at the Galle cricket stadium on Friday.
	   Resuming from an overnight 122 for 5, New Zealand hit trouble
when Dharmasena dismissed Nathan Astle (53), Chris Cairns (0) and
Chris Harris (4).
	   Astle was held by Hashan Tillekaratne at short-leg soon after he
reached his half century which had four boundaries and one six off
as many as 191 balls.
	   Cairns was caught by Sanath Jayasuriya at leg-slip and Harris
was taken by Pramodya Wickremasinghe at mid-on.
	   The match started after an hour's delay after a sudden shower
just five minutes before the scheduled commencement.
	   More than eight hours of play has been lost due to wet
conditions at the ground, which was debuting as the world's 79th
Test venue.

Japan's emperor returns after three-nation European trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's emperor and empress returned to Tokyo on
Friday after a two-week European trip that took them to Britain,
Denmark and Portugal, an Imperial Household Agency spokesman said.
	   Reiterating comments he made to former British prisoners of war,
Emperor Akihito said after arriving at Tokyo's Haneda airport that
deep scars remain from Japan's role in World War II, the spokesman
said.
	   His visit to Britain was marked by protests from angry British
veterans who were interned in Japanese prisoner camps during the
war. They have demanded a straightforward apology and compensation
from Japan.
	   Japanese officials argued that the emperor is not a political
figure, and therefore is not in a position to offer an apology.
Under Japan's postwar constitution, the emperor officially serves
as a symbol of the state.
	   Speaking to reporters Friday afternoon, the emperor noted that
Japan enjoys strong postwar ties with Britain and other European
nations.
	   Akihito and wife Empress Michiko were greeted at the airport by
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Crown Prince Naruhito
and Crown Princess Masako.
	   Chief government spokesman Kanezo Muraoka hailed the imperial
couple's European trip for having helped advanced Japan's relations
with the trio of nations.

Iglesias opens Lebanon summer concert season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After an absence of 20 years, Spanish
singer Julio Iglesias is back in Lebanon to perform at two concerts
in the Lebanese capital.
	   Iglesias arrived Thursday and met with Lebanon's president and
prime minister in a ritual for returning celebrity performers that
is part of Lebanon's effort to restore its prewar status as the
Arab world's entertainment and commercial hub.
	   The Spanish crooner, accompanied by 35 musicians and dancers,
will perform in the Forum de Beyrouth hall on Friday and Saturday.
The hall is built in the Karantina district, site of some of the
worst fighting in the early days of the 1975-1990 civil war.
	   Also accompanying him is his 1-month-old baby.
	   ``I bring him to Lebanon to show to everyone how much I love,
care and believe in this country,'' he said in comments carried
Friday by the English-language Daily Star.
	   Tickets for the concert run dlrs 50, dlrs 75 and dlrs 150 _ well
beyond the means of many Lebanese.
	   Iglesias, known in Lebanon as ``Khoolio,'' last performed in
1978 in the Christian port city of Jounieh north of Beirut during a
lull in the civil war.
	   In September, tenor Luciano Pavarotti will give his first Middle
East concert in Beirut. Singers Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey, and Jose
Carreras, the band Gypsy Kings and cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch
are among those who have played Lebanon in the past few years.

Khmer Rouge guerrillas mark official return to the fold

	   ANLONG VENG, Cambodia (AP) _ More than 1,000 former Khmer Rouge
rebels on Friday changed out of their communist-style olive drab
gear and into the uniforms of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces,
marking their official return to the government fold.
	   The ceremony went peacefully, despite what a government officer
described as an attempt at disruption by some of the few hardcore
guerrillas still holding out along the border with Thailand.
	   Chea Sarun, armed forces chief of operations, said there had
been sporadic fighting with seven or eight Khmer Rouge rebels about
15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) west of the former guerrilla base of
Anlong Veng where the reintegration ceremony was held.
	   He said the fighting involved an exchange of automatic weapons
fire and the detonation of a land mine, but did not provide further
details.
	   The incident did little to dampen hopes that the ceremony may
stand as a funeral for the bloody Khmer Rouge movement, shattered
by defections and the loss of its last stronghold.
	   The guerrilla group held power from 1975 to 1979, killing as
many as two million Cambodians with overwork, illness, starvation
and systematic execution during a reign of terror.
	   After years of failed government attempts to defeat the
Maoist-inspired rebels directly on the battlefield following their
fall from power, the end of resistance at Anlong Veng was triggered
by a mutiny in March by disgruntled guerrillas.
	   The defectors, supported by government troops, were able to
drive out hard-liners loyal to Ta Mok, the tough and wily successor
to the late Pol Pot, their longtime leader.
	   Ta Mok and a handful of loyalists are believed to be hanging on
somewhere along the Thai border, though their exact numbers and
whereabouts are unknown.
	   Chea Sarun told reporters Friday that he had no idea where Ta
Mok was, but he suspected he might be on Thai territory, since he
could not be found inside Cambodia.
	   Thailand denies harboring Ta Mok and his forces.
	   More than 1,000 former guerrillas took part in Friday's
celebration, discarding their old uniforms as they were inducted
into the government armed forces. They were accompanied by 3,000
civilian followers.
	   Chea Sarun said the guerrillas stood in for a total of 3,665
defecting fighters, and that in total, 20,000 people were being
officially welcomed back to the government side.
	   The ceremony marked the beginning of three days of celebrating
with music and dance, but Anlong Veng is a reminder of the
brutality of the Khmer Rouge, who carried out widespread atrocities
when they held power.
	   The ceremony included a speech by Yim Phanna, former commander
of Khmer Rouge division 980, who led the March mutiny and is thus
credited for what many believe will prove to be the final
unraveling of the guerrilla movement.
	   He vowed that they be determined not to allow a recurrence of
the ``killing fields'' of the Khmer Rouge.
	   He also urged the crowd to follow the ways of the government,
obey the rules of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, and support the
election upcoming in July in order to reduce poverty.

Lynagh prepares report on England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian fly-half Michael
Lynagh has helped plot England's downfall in Saturday's test as the
Wallabies continue their search to properly replace him.
	   Australia will gamble on fullback Stephen Larkham in the
fly-half position against a much-maligned and inexperienced English
side.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen said Lynagh, the Wallaby's last
outstanding fly-half who retired in 1995, had warned his team about
complacency against an English side missing several regulars and
featuring five new caps.
	   Lynagh made a timely return home after two years with the
Saracens club in London and he has been on vacation just a short
drive up the highway from the Wallaby team's base at Caloundra.
	   He was grilled about the side of virtual unknowns while Wallaby
coach Rod Macqueen sifted through various videos trying to get a
handle on the young Englishmen.
	   ``The main difficulty is the unknown,'' Macqueen said Friday.
``Normally you've got a known combination where you can plan and
prepare. The reality is that we haven't been able to do that.
	   ``The people who do know about these players, like Lynagh, are
the people who are putting out the warning bells.''
	   Of particular interest was Lynagh's young Saracens teammate Ben
Sturnham, a big flanker who has the speed of a winger and regularly
joins the backline.
	   Sturnham is one of the new caps along with flanker Pat
Sanderson, scrum half Scott Benton, winger Spencer Brown and center
Steve Ravenscroft.
	   While the English have expressed some disappointment with the
criticism by Australian authorities, they have also played up their
supposed inadequacies.
	   ``There is a huge area of doubt _ to be honest, we are scared,''
said England's assistant coach John Mitchell. ``I cannot fault the
boys' enthusiasm or desire, but we've had little previous
experience to work on for this match. The whole week has been
totally focused on organization. I've felt a little bit like a
school teacher both in the team room and outside on the training
pitch.''
	   Both teams are gambling at fly-half, with England's Jonny
Wilkinson given the role despite just four minutes of test rugby.
	   ``Larkham is new in that position so that's an unanswered
question,'' Macqueen said. ``I don't think short term it's as big a
punt as some of the younger players we could have put in there.
What we are looking for long term is stability. He'll be the answer
to that.''
	   Larkham is hopeful he won't have to resort too much to his
untested tactical kicking game.
	   ``I'm sure the (English) coach has realized it's my first test
in the position so the flankers will be putting a lot of pressure
on,'' Larkham said. ``With our game plan, as long as it's not
raining, we won't be kicking the ball too much.''
	   Lineups:
	   Australia: Matthew Burke; Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan,
Joe Roff; Stephen Larkham, George Gregan; Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales (capt), Tom Bowman, Andrew
Blades, Phil Kearns, Richard Harry. Reserves: Chris Whitaker,
Nathan Grey, Jason Little, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Dan
Crowley, Jeremy Paul.
	   England: Tim Stimpson; Spencer Brown, Matt Perry, Steve
Ravenscroft, Austin Healey; Jonny Wilkinson, Scott Benton; Tony
Diprose (capt), Pat Sanderson, Ben Sturnham, Gareth Archer, Danny
Grewcock, Phil Vickery, Richard Cockerill, Graham Rowntree.

Lebed inaugurated as governor of Siberian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was
sworn in Friday as governor of a huge region in central Siberia _ a
post seen by many as a springboard to the presidency.
	   During the solemn inauguration ceremony, Lebed took an oath on
the Bible and was blessed by Bishop Antoniy, leader of the Russian
Orthodox Church in the Krasnoyarsk region.
	   Lebed, a gravel-voiced former paratroop general, ran for
president in 1996 and has long said he plans to run again. However,
he played down those ambitions during the gubernatorial race,
saying he would only run for president in 2000 if he succeeds in
improving the economy in Krasnoyarsk.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian business mogul who
supported Lebed's run for governor, attended his inauguration and
hailed him as a ``serious Russian politician.''
	   However Berezovsky, now serving in government as executive
secretary of the alliance former Soviet republics, quickly added
that Lebed would be a ``big problem for the nation'' if elected
Russian president.
	   Berezovsky has previously said that he helped Lebed's election
in Krasnoyarsk so he would get bogged down in the region's problems
and be less able to run for president in 2000.
	   Lebed has denied he received any financial assistance from
Berezovsky.
	   Lebed finished a strong third in Russia's last presidential
election in 1996. Later that year he received nationwide acclaim
for his role in negotiating the end to the deeply unpopular war in
secessionist Chechnya.

Police warnings to dissidents don't deter Tiananmen commemoration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police interrogated dissidents in Shanghai but
didn't deter a small group of democracy campaigners from gathering
to remember the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, a rights
group reported Friday.
	   At least three dissidents were questioned by police Thursday,
the ninth anniversary of the military assault that ended the
student-led protest movement on June 4, 1989, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.
	   One of those questioned, Zhou Jianhe, was last seen being taken
from his home by police at 8 p.m. and is presumed to still be in
custody, the group said.
	   Police went Thursday morning to Yao Zhenxian's home to take him
away, but relented because he recently underwent surgery, the group
said. Yao finished a two-year stint in a labor camp in April.
	   Police questioned Yao at his home for five hours and warned him
not to take part in any activities connected to the anniversary,
the group said. In spite of the warning, Yao later met with six
others to share memories of the protest movement.
	   The military assault ended six weeks of demonstrations and
killed hundreds if not thousands of people. Thousands more were
arrested across China in the crackdown. The Communist Party has
never provided a full accounting of the assault nor divulged the
death toll.
	   Party leaders have feared ever since that the anniversary will
be used to rally opposition. Police rounded up about two dozen
dissidents nationwide this year to prevent commemorations.
	   One Beijing dissident, Xu Wenli, was detained on his way to
visit his sister in southeastern Shenzhen city, next to Hong Kong,
the Information Center said. Police held him at a hotel in
Guangdong province for several days and sent him back to Beijing on
Thursday.
	   In eastern Zhejiang province, some one painted ``Don't Forget
the '89 Democracy Movement'' and ``Redress June 4'' in meter-
(three-foot-) tall red characters across a bridge in Anji county,
the group said.
	   It said about 100 police were seen scouring the bridge, and
passersby were ordered not to read the slogans.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A simple, tragic car accident, caused by a drunk
driver. Is that the whole answer?
	   That's what Judge Herve Stephan wants to find out Friday from
the key witnesses in the Princess Diana case: the photographers
under investigation, their lawyers, and Mohamed Al Fayed.
	   Stephan summoned the parties for a closed-door hearing to try to
clarify the main question in the case: Who was at fault?
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But what was the responsibility of the paparazzi trailing
Diana's Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and a press motorcyclist have been placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for
both manslaughter and failing to come to the aid of a person in
danger.
	   The hearing which brings together most all major figures in the
case was likely to stand as an important step.
	   Even Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, showed up for the
hearing.
	   Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a Mercedes,
surrounded by four other cars and about 10 body guards.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' Al Fayed said
before disappearing into the ornate building.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said he felt annoyed.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,'' said
Arsov. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have to do their
job.''
	   Arsov was supposed to be shooting pictures Friday at the French
Open tennis tournament.
	   Police with two lists, one bearing the names of the
photographers, the other about 10 witnesses, checked off the
arrivals.
	   In contrast to previous hearings, television cameras were kept
outside the grounds of the Palais de Justice surrounded by police.

Suspected Basque separatist dies in shoot-out with police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUERNIKA, Spain (AP) _ A woman believed to be a member of the
armed separatist group ETA died in a shoot-out with police early
Friday, authorities said.
	   A police agent was shot in the arm in the exchange of fire
triggered by a raid on a suspected separatist hideout the town of
Guernika located in the heart of Spain's troubled northern Basque
region, a police spokesman said.
	   The woman, who was not identified, opened fire on police before
agents returned fire and she fell to the ground, the spokesman
reported speaking with customary anonymity.
	   A second suspected ETA member was injured and detained after
attempting to escape by jumping from the second floor apartment in
Pablo Picasso Street, the spokesman said.
	   Police said they arrested a further 12 people later in the
morning in the surrounding area and seized firearms and cash from
the apartment following the raid that took place at 2 a.m.
(0000gmt).
	   Authorities said the operation had destroyed the operative
capacity of an important ETA commando.
	   In recent months the government has claimed several major blows
to the ETA _ an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom. ETA has
killed five people so far this year and nearly 800 since beginning
its violent campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.

APEC adopts mutual recognition for telecoms equipment

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations on Friday agreed to trim
the testing requirements for imported telecom equipment in a pact
aimed at cutting costs and bringing new products to the market more
quickly.
	   The Mutual Recognition Arrangement, adopted by government
ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, is part
of a program aimed at eliminating tariffs on all information
technology products by 2000.
	   A similar agreement between the United States and the European
Union was signed May 18.
	   The APEC agreement allows already tested and certified products
to be exported without requirements for retesting in the import
country and will speed up marketing of technologies and products
that are rapidly updated.
	   The agreement ``will boost trade in telecommunications and
information equipment goods among members of APEC, affecting
roughly dlrs 45 billion in current trade flows, or one-third of the
global market,'' the U.S. Trade Representative office said in a
statement from Washington, D.C.
	   The arrangement sets up a framework for manufacturers and
exporters to test according to the standards of the importing
country, and provides remedies for when something goes wrong.
	   The arrangement covers all equipment subject to
telecommunication regulations, including wireline and wireless,
terrestrial and satellite equipment.
	   The APEC telecommunications and information ministers released a
declaration specifying dates for 16 of the 18 member nations to put
the agreement into effect. Chile and New Zealand indicated they
would not put the agreement into effect because their regulations
are already simple enough for imports.
	   Usually, testing and certification are expensive procedures for
exporters, importers and regulators, and those costs are often
passed to buyers and users. Simplified procedures reduce costs.
	   ``At the same time, regulators need to have confidence in the
quality of testing that provides the basis for certification of
equipment,'' the U.S. Trade Representative said.
	   The agreement is part of a voluntary liberalization process that
APEC leaders launched last November in Vancouver.
Telecommunications is one of the nine sectors targeted for early
action in the first half of this year.
	   APEC trade ministers will meet in Kuching, Malaysia, on June
22-23 to discuss the remaining eight target sectors: environmental
goods and services, medical equipment and instruments, chemicals,
energy sector, forest products, fish, gems and jewelry, and toys.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Candidate members are Russia, Vietnam and Peru.

Air France strike into fifth day, labor unrest spreads

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup approaching, Air France
officials and pilots worked early Friday to end a strike that has
threatened to disrupt the global soccer tournament.
	   The third round of talks between Air France and pilots' unions
began at the company's Paris headquarters about 7 p.m. Thursday and
ended at 4:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). There were no signs of an immediate
breakthrough as the strike entered its fifth day Friday.
	   After the talks, Rene Philippeau, a pilot's spokesman, said the
proposals made by Air France were ``much too vague'' and thus
``unacceptable.''
	   Air France spokesman Francois Brousse, speaking to reporters
after Thursday's meeting began, said there were ``constructive
foundations'' for an agreement to prosper.
	   The pilots are prepared to strike for at least 15 days,
coinciding with the start of the June 10-July 12 soccer
championship which will attract an estimated 1 million visitors.
	   Despite the strike, Air France, the World Cup's official
carrier, has guaranteed transport for the 32 teams taking part.
	   With just six days until the World Cup begins, France is plagued
by labor disputes.
	   Rail workers were set to begin a strike Friday which was to last
through the weekend, seriously hampering rail travel through
France.
	   Paris subway drivers and railway workers in southern France
staged minor strikes Thursday, heaping further misery on visitors
already in France for the World Cup, as well as other tourists.
	   Baggage handlers have been on strike for three days at Charles
de Gaulle airport in Paris, and airline mechanics also planned a
walkout.
	   The transport woes were causing embarrassment and anger among
French officials who feared for the country's image.
	   Michel Charasse, a Socialist senator, accused the pilots of
being ``egotistical, and not loving their country'' in an interview
with Europe 1 radio.
	   Leading conservative lawmaker Philippe Seguin said the strike
risked making France ``the laughing stock of the entire world.''
	   The highly paid pilots are protesting planned salary cuts. The
company wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts.
	   The strike posed a big test for the Socialist-government of
Lionel Jospin. But the government was standing firm.
	   The airline ``has the full support of the government,'' the
Socialist Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told the
National Assembly.
	   The company said it planned 17 percent of its long-distance
flights Friday, 30 percent of its short and medium-distance routes
from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40 percent from Orly.

State Department pulls out non-essential staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ The U.S. State Department has ordered all
dependents of U.S. government employees and all non-essential staff
to leave Eritrea because of the worsening border conflict between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, the U.S. Embassy said Friday.
	   The embassy also ``strongly advised'' other U.S. citizens in the
country to leave and discourged U.S. citizens from travelling to
Eritrea.
	   A flight out of the country has been chartered for Friday at 7
p.m local (1600gmt).
	   The border conflict erupted a month ago in areas of southwestern
and southeastern Eritrea, but it was not made public until May 13
when Ethiopia accused Eritrea of invading and occupying its
territory.
	   On that date, Ethiopian Airlines suspended all its flights to
Asmara. Eritrea does not operate its own airline.
	   Following several days of cross-border artillery and rocket
battles in which an undetermined number of Eritreans and Ethiopians
died, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on Thursday agreed to a
four-point proposal by the United States and Rwanda to end the
conflict peacefully.
	   One of the points recommends that Eritrea withdraw to positions
it held before May 6.
	   The reaction of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki was not
immediately known.

Drought continues in the south; government orders help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The drought is officially over, but parts
of southern Vietnam still are suffering from the prolonged dry
spell, the Thanh Nien newspaper reported Friday.
	   The paper quoted the southern weather forecast center as saying
that after the onset of the rainy season in late May, precipitation
has dropped sharply this month, with half of the southern provinces
getting no rain in the last five days.
	   The report said rain was expected to resume Saturday.
	   The government has estimated damage from the drought, the worst
in a century, at dlrs 385 million and said it affected more than 1
million farmers and family members, with 450,000 suffering from
serious hunger.
	   The Vietnam Economic Times said Friday that 175.5 billion dong
(dlrs 13.5 million) is needed to fight the drought's affects in the
Mekong Delta, the country main rice-growing area.
	   The Ministry of Agiculture estimates the money would be needed
to buy fuel and electricity to run water pumps and pay for the
labor.
	   The 12 Mekong Delta provinces already have spent 276 billion
dong (dlrs 21 million) on dredging irrigation canals.
	   The Liberated Saigon newspaper, meanwhile, reported that the
government has outlined nine measures to overcome the severe
consequences of the drought.
	   They include allocating 3,400 tons of rice for badly affected
families, 5.6 billion dong for farmers and 250-300 billion dong
(dlrs 19 million-dlrs 23 million) for crucial irrigation projects.
	   The State Bank of Vietnam also is making loans available to
farmers. Commercial banks have been asked to reschedule outstanding
debts for badly affected farmers.
	   The government also instructed local governments to work out
immediate and long-term measures to fight drought in their
localities.

Soccer-mad Vietnam gears up for World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Bars are offering World Cup specials. TV
repairmen will be on call at all hours _ except during matches, of
course _ to help desperate viewers. The French Embassy will be
staffed 24 hours a day to answer questions.
	   Vietnam doesn't have a team at the World Cup that starts next
week in France, but it seems that everyone in the soccer-mad
country is gearing up for soccer's premier event.
	   Employers already know to expect bleary-eyed workers while the
tournament is on.
	   State television plans to show every match, most live, others on
tape delay if there are two matches on at the same time. The
schedule means some matches will be aired at 2 a.m. local time.

India studying demands by five nuclear powers

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Friday was closely studying
demands by the five original nuclear powers that it and Pakistan
give up their nuclear ambitions and instead sit down together to
resolve issues fueling their rivalry, including the dispute over
the border region of Kashmir.
	   India will give its response after ``closely examining'' the
Thursday's joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States, the Press Trust of
India news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh as
saying.
	   Last month India conducted a series of nuclear tests, citing its
fear of Pakistan and China. Pakistan responded with its own tests,
setting off fears the long-standing South Asian rivalry could
culminate with nuclear war.
	   Meeting Thursday in Geneva, the foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council offered to help
India and Pakistan resolve their differences, especially their
competing claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   But the main responsibility for making peace is theirs, said
Tang Jiaxuan of China, who chaired the meeting.
	   New Delhi has in the past rejected any outside pressure to
settle the Kashmir dispute, the flash point of two of India's three
wars with Pakistan in the past 50 years. Pakistan, though, has
pressed for it to be taken up in international fora, believing it
is at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with its larger and more
powerful neighbor.
	   In Geneva, the local government of Pakistan-held Kashmir
welcomed the mention of Kashmir by the five foreign secretaries,
saying in a resolution that ``without a permanent solution of the
Kashmir issue peace in the region cannot be guaranteed.''
	   Pakistan's national government did not immediately react to the
Geneva deliberations.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Parliament on
Thursday that his government was prepared to discuss Kashmir
bilaterally with Pakistan.
	   The Geneva statement also asked India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without conditions.
	   Soon after conducting its tests, India said it planned no more
but wouldn't sign the treaty in its present form because it allows
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to keep their
nuclear arsenals.
	   Pakistan, which responded with nuclear tests of its own, says it
will sign the CTBT only if India adhered to it.
	   Though India and Pakistan now claim to be capable of building
nuclear bombs, the five nations who were the first to perfect
weapons of mass destruction refused to welcome any new members into
their club of nuclear powers, as defined by the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters they
could not let any other nation on the nuclear threshold believe it
``can test its way in.''
	   Pakistan and India, Albright and the other ministers said,
should refrain from any more tests, from building or deploying
nuclear weapons, or from testing missiles to carry nuclear bombs.
Many fear the next stage of the costly, potentially catastrophic
South Asian nuclear arms race will be developing delivery systems.
	   The ministers did not threaten sanctions, which the United
States has been alone among the five in imposing.
	   Sanctions only hurt the people and neighboring countries and
``have little effect on leaders who often act in isolation and
sometimes unpredictably,'' said Russia's Yevgeny Primakov.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Foreign ministers of the world's five major
nuclear powers are urging India and Pakistan to meet at the
bargaining table and refrain from intensifying their dangerous
nuclear arms race.
	   ``We have no illusions,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told reporters after an emergency meeting Thursday with her
counterparts from Britain, China, France and Russia. ``But the
process has begun.''
	   A joint statement demanded the South Asian neighbors refrain
from further nuclear tests and resolve their differences with
direct talks. India, followed by Pakistan, set off a series of
nuclear tests last month, escalating tensions on the subcontinent.
	   Albright said such testing left the people of India and Pakistan
less secure and cost both nations respect around the world.
	   ``They might not have expected this kind of very widespread
condemnation of what they have done,'' she said.
	   The ministers said the two nations also didn't make it into the
so-called ``nuclear club,'' which is restricted to the five nations
by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty signed by 186 nations, not
including India or Pakistan.
	   To allow them into the club would, in effect, reward them for
testing nuclear weapons and encourage other nations to defy global
arms reduction efforts, the ministers said.
	   ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons
states,'' the statement said.
	   The ministers called for direct negotiations between India and
Pakistan on such issues as the hotly disputed northern territory of
Kashmir. The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said India and Pakistan
must take the lead in solving their own differences.
	   In a pointed reference to India's role in setting off the
exchange of nuclear tests, Tang said, ``It is up to the one who
tied the knot to untie it.''
	   The communique threatened no new sanctions but urged the two
nations to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to refrain
from exporting nuclear weapons and missile technology or expanding
their own nuclear arsenals.
	   ``We are prepared to help India and Pakistan maintain peace if
they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said Albright.
	   The ministers didn't discuss sanctions, which the United States
has been alone in imposing.
	   U.S. officials said Albright wanted to make sure Russia's
traditional lean toward India and China's support for Pakistan did
not prevent the five powers from producing a strong joint
statement.
	   The statement, hammered out Wednesday night by experts from the
five countries, was approved ``without change or controversy'' by
the ministers, according to British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   India will respond after ``closely examining'' the statement,
Press Trust of India quoted foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh
as saying. Pakistan had no immediate comment.

Rebels say they killed 100 Sri Lankan soldiers
</HEADLINE>
  By NIRESH ELIATAMBY  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger rebels claimed Friday they
killed at least 100 soldiers in the latest flare-up in fighting in
northern Sri Lanka. The government broadcast appeals for blood for
the wounded.
	   The guerrillas' clandestine radio said they lost 20 fighters as
they beat back a government offensive Thursday in the North.
	   The military spokesman didn't confirm the casualties but
reported heavy fighting after government troops attacked rebel
defenses near Kilinochchi, 275 kilometers (170 miles) to the north,
in a two-pronged assault to capture the region's main highway from
guerrilla control.
	   Some army officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 34
soldiers were killed and 420 wounded in 24 hours of fighting that
saw troops advance one kilometer (half a mile) into
rebel-controlled territory.
	   In Colombo, state-run radio announced that hospitals were in
urgent need of blood donations from the public. On Thursday,
ambulances raced to hospitals in the Sri Lankan capital with
wounded soldiers who had been airlifted from Kilinochchi.
	   Government forces have been battling since May last year to
capture a vital highway that would connect the Jaffna Peninsula
with the rest of Sri Lanka. The army captured the
1,000-square-kilometer (400-square-mile) peninsula in 1996 from the
Tamil rebels, who had run the area like a mini-state for five
years.
	   So far, the troops have captured about two-thirds of the
highway, with another 27 kilometers (17 miles) to go. At present,
Jaffna's half million people rely on air and sea deliveries of food
and other supplies.
	   The clandestine radio, Voice of Tigers, monitored in
government-controlled town of Vavuniya, 210 kilometers (130 miles)
north of Colombo, said the rebels have found the bodies of 40 Sri
Lankan soldiers and would like to hand them over to the
International Committee of the Red Cross later Friday.
	   The radio also said government troops carried away nearly 60
bodies. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claim
since the area is out of bounds for civilians.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland, accusing the
Sinhalese majority of oppressing the Tamil minority. The war began
in 1983 and has so far claimed 52,000 lives.

Indonesian government critic pulls out of president's advisory
</HEADLINE>
panel

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pressure on President B.J. Habibie to
speed up an election timetable mounted on Friday after a
presidential adviser quit saying the pace of reform was too slow.
	   Habibie has pledged to push through democratic reforms in the
wake of the ouster last month of his mentor, former President
Suharto. The new leader inherited a nation wracked by political and
economic turmoil after three decades of autocratic rule.
	   Opposition figure Emil Salim, who agreed to guide Habibie on
policy decisions from time to time, said he was backing out of an
advisory panel because the 61-year-old technocrat was waffling.
	   Bowing to calls for new leadership, Habibie promised to stage
general elections as soon as possible. Then he said the poll would
take place by the end of 1999 after Parliament overhauls rigid
electoral laws from the Suharto era.
	   ``He's taking a very long time,'' Salim said in a speech Friday
at Jakarta's Atma Jaya University. He urged Habibie to hold the
general elections in December.
	   Indonesians, meanwhile, tested their newfound political
freedoms, staging a string of rallies for separate causes. A group
of ethnic Chinese launched a political party to battle the
ostracism they have suffered for decades.
	   Chinese are resented because they dominate the economy, and
rioters burned and looted hundreds of Chinese-owned shops during
unrest in Jakarta and other cities last month.
	   Uncertainty about Indonesia's political and economic future
lingers, and Salim and others say a new president, untainted by the
association with Suharto, is needed. Habibie, a former Cabinet
minister, was a close friend and ally of Suharto, who quit amid a
swell of protest against his long rule.
	   The fate of Habibie's advisory panel, made up of half a dozen
government critics, was in doubt. Prominent opposition leader Amien
Rais pulled out of it last month, saying he did not want to be
coopted by the government and could work better from outside it.
	   In one Jakarta protest Friday, dozens of protesters shook the
gates of the U.S. Embassy, accusing Washington of interfering in
the internal affairs of their crisis-ridden country.
	   The group alleged that Washington was trying to delay the
restarting of a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout plan put together
for Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund.
	   About 30 demonstrators also marched to a toll road in a protest
against its owner, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of
Suharto. They urged motorists not to pay the toll, saying Suharto
family businesses are corrupt and have sapped the economy of much
of its wealth.
	   About 150 people also rallied against Environment Minister
Panangian Siregar outside his office, saying he was a lackey of the
old government.

Hong Kong Democrats call for deficit budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's largest party called on the
government Friday spend more and prepare for a deficit budget to
boost the recession-bound economy.
	   Democratic Party economic spokesman Sin Chung-kai said the
government needs to break from its tradition of tying spending
directly to economic growth.
	   Traditionally, officials have limited growth in the budget
according to growth in the economy and kept a budget surplus. But
now, the economy is shrinking.
	   ``If the government reduces expenditure it affects the whole
economy,'' Sin said on Radio Hong Kong. The economic downturn will
worsen if the government doesn't prime the economy, he said.
	   Democrats, who are broadly critical of the Beijing government
and Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, hold 13 seats in the
legislature that was elected May 24. With smaller allies, they
account for one-third of Hong Kong's 60-seat legislature.
	   Tsang Yok-sing of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong _ the largest pro-Beijing party that relies on grassroots
support _ also said laws were flexible enough to allow an increase
in government spending exceeding economic growth, the South China
Morning Post reported.
	   Tsang called on the government to raise taxes or introduce a
deficit budget if it needed extra money to cover expenditures, the
Post said.
	   Officials say the economy, which contracted 2 percent in the
first quarter of the year, is likely to slide even further in the
second quarter. Two consecutive quarters of economic contraction
would technically put Hong Kong in recession.

Arthur C. Clarke cautions against asteroid hitting the earth
</HEADLINE>
  By DILIP GANGULY  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Science fiction writer Arthur C.
Clarke said Friday that scientists should do more to prepare for
the possibility of the earth getting hit by an asteroid.
	   ``We should be talking more about it and we should be finding
out more about it,'' said Sir Arthur, 80, who has made this island
country in the Indian Ocean his home for about four decades.
	   ``During the past weeks, the sun was hit by asteroids,'' Sir
Arthur said. ``There is a need for more work.''
	   The International Astronomical Union has identified 108
asteroids that orbit close enough to Earth to be called potentially
hazardous objects. Some researchers have proposed sending a rocket
carrying a nuclear explosive to nudge a dangerous asteroid into a
safer orbit.
	   An asteroid 10 kilometers (6 miles) to 16 kilometers (10 miles)
across collided with the Earth about 65 million years ago and is
thought by some to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs,
along with 75 percent of all other species.

Momentum building for Cambodian genocide trial: UN rights envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A top United Nations human rights
envoy said Friday that leaders of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
movement could be tried by an international tribunal as early as
next year for crimes against humanity.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, a special representative of the U.N.
secretary general, said at a press conference that the momentum for
an international trial has picked up pace and he is increasingly
``optimistic about the possibilities.''
	   ``If there is political will (in Cambodia), it could happen
within the next year,'' Hammarberg said, adding that there appears
to be a consensus across Cambodia's political spectrum that an
internationally-assisted trial should take place.
	   As many as 2 million Cambodians were killed during the guerrilla
group's 1975-79 regime through overwork, illness, disease and
execution.
	   The longtime leader of the group, Pol Pot, died of a reported
heart attack in April but an estimated 20 influential Khmer Rouge
leaders who scholars and legal experts believe should be tried are
still at large.
	   Three experts working with the U.N. _ including a former judge
in the Yugoslav tribunals _ are expected to arrive in Cambodia as
early as September to assess the strength of evidence which has
been complied against suspected war criminals, he said.
	   The findings could be raised before the U.N. General Assembly
this December, Hammarberg said, adding, that it is crucial that
Cambodia make clear that they want to see the Khmer Rouge leaders
tried.
	   ``Political unity internationally will be very weak if there are
any question marks here,'' he said.
	   Hammarberg said that if the Cambodian parliament adopts a legal
act calling for the trial of the top Khmer Rouge leaders, and
accepts an invitation by the U.N. to provide the judges and
prosecution, ``the Security Council will not be able to block'' the
proceedings.
	   Fears have previously been expressed that China, a permanent
member of the Security Council with veto power, would stand in the
way of the U.N.'s efforts to try Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   It has in the past said it would protest such a tribunal as
interference in Cambodia's internal affairs.
	   Hammarberg said that he thought, if possible, Cambodia should be
the venue for the trial.
	   ``I don't think it is appropriate to come and hijack (suspected
war criminals) and put them in a Dutch prison,'' Hammarberg said,
adding that the process of trying genocide suspects could serve as
a healing process for survivors. ``I think participation here is
important.''
	   Ironically, as Hammarberg spoke at the Royal Phnom Penh hotel,
Ieng Sary, who was deputy prime minister during the Khmer Rouge's
1975-79 regime, was strolling the hotel's hallways.
	   Ieng Sary defected to the government in 1996 with some 10,000
war-weary guerrillas. In exchange, he received a royal pardon for a
1979 death sentence handed down in absentia by a Phnom Penh court.
	   That pardon does not, however, protect him from prosecution
before an international tribunal.
	   Until trials are held, said Hammarberg, ``possible suspects will
walk around free, and we just have to live with that.''
	   Asked what it was like eating breakfast a few tables down from
Ieng Sary, one of the people experts agree should stand trial, he
smiled, and said, ``I wondered if that could happen in any country
other than this one.''

Report: More than 1,000 taxi drivers strike in Shenzhen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 1,000 taxi drivers went on strike in
the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen to protest high fees and
penalties, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The taxis converged on an empty lot in the Futian district of
Shenzhen, the freewheeling capitalist city bordering Hong Kong, to
protest what they said were high rental and maintenance fees, as
well as high penalties for minor offenses charged by taxi
companies, the Apple Daily reported.
	   Police in Futian customarily refuse to comment.
	   The paper said that strike was called off by midmorning after
police went to the site threatening to tow the cars away.
	   It said some taxi drivers refused to participate, and took their
cars to the outskirts of the city for a silent protest, fearing
government reprisals for what they called a non-political strike.
	   Millions in mainland China have already been laid off as the
government seeks to boost debt-ridden state firms with
capitalist-style methods such as mergers, stock issues, and
bankruptcies.
	   Unemployment has been accompanied by frequent outbreaks of
unrest, including strikes and worker protests, raising fears of
widespread instability.

Israeli soldier wounded in south Lebanon attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas wounded an Israeli soldier
in an overnight attack on an Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese and Israeli officials said Friday.
	   The guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at the Israeli
patrol near the village of Sojod inside an Israeli-occupied border
enclave in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said.
	   One soldier was wounded in the 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) attack, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said a soldier was
``lightly wounded'' in the attack. The wounded soldier was
evacuated by helicopter to an Israeli hospital for treatment, the
spokesman said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
which is believed to have been carried out by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group.
	   Another Israeli soldier was wounded Thursday in a roadside bomb
attack claimed by Hezbollah, which also announced the death of one
of its guerrillas in fighting.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to try to
oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from
the occupied zone, which Israel established in 1985 with the aim of
preventing cross-border attack on its northern towns.
	   Elsewhere in south Lebanon, two Nepalese soldiers serving with
the United Nations peacekeeping force in the region were killed and
two others wounded in a traffic accident, the U.N. force said
Friday.
	   Since it was dispatched to south Lebanon in 1978 following an
Israeli invasion, 222 members of the 4,500-strong U.N. force have
died in fighting and accidents.

President appoints new head for central bank

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ President Martti Ahtisaari on Friday
appointed Matti Vanhala as the Bank of Finland's new governor, to
succeed Sirkka Hamalainen who joined the European Central Bank.
	   The appointment takes effect immediately.
	   The central bank's supervisory council, which is chosen by
Parliament, on Wednesday proposed that the president appoint
Vanhala, who has a 25-year career in the bank.
	   Vanhala, 52, has been a member of the central bank's board since
1992. From 1977 to 1980, he was a member of the International
Monetary Fund's board, including its director.
	   Hamalainen, who had been governor of the Bank of Finland since
1992, resigned when she was elected to the six-member board of the
European Central Bank, which started work June 1.

Japanese nuclear reactor shuts down automatically
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A nuclear reactor in western Japan shut down
automatically Friday after heavy water levels at the facility fell
below accepted standards, a company official said.
	   The Fugen thermal reactor in Tsuruga, 323 kilometers (202 miles)
west of Tokyo, stopped operating at 1:47 p.m., said Jinmo Otaka, a
spokesman for the semi-public Nuclear Development Corp., or Donen.
	   There was no danger of radioactivity escaping into the
environment, Otaka said.
	   Officials were still investigating why the water level dropped
and triggered the shut down, he said.
	   Last year, Fugen was ordered to close down for 51 days after
Donen officials failed to report a radioactive tritium leak.
Confidence in Japan's ambitious nuclear power program has been
battered in recent years by a series of accidents and coverups.

Aid workers to begin counting Afghan survivors

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ With thousands of people still
going hungry, relief efforts were again delayed by rain Friday, but
officials said that once the clouds lift food will begin flowing
faster to earthquake-ravaged villages in the mountains of northern
Afghanistan.
	   The region still rumbled daily with aftershocks of the horrific
quake that struck six days ago _ the second in four months in this
forlorn and undeveloped region. Local officials estimate the death
toll at 4,700 people. International aid agencies have still not
reached dozens of damaged and isolated villages.
	   The relief effort received a major boost Thursday when aircraft
fuel was flown into the regional center of Faisabad. The fuel was
caught in a standoff with customs authorities in Tajikistan that
delayed the stationing of fuel barrels here by at least a day.
	   But the fuel arrived Thursday evening, too late to stop the four
small helicopters on relief patrols from returning to Tajikistan to
refuel. On Friday, a rainstorm kept them grounded there and once
again paralyzed the operation.
	   A U.S. promise to lease two big Russian helicopters brought
cheer to relief workers. The planes, operated by a private company
in Russia, will have 10 times the capacity of the aged fleet of
four choppers that the United Nations and the Red Cross scraped
together.
	   Once the flow of food resumes, aid workers hope to begin
reaching outlying areas of the 1,750-square-kilometer
(700-square-mile) quake zone to begin counting survivors and
assessing needs.
	   In the 15-minute stops to unload food packages, aid workers have
not had time to take an accurate reading of the death toll,
concentrating instead on the needs of the living and the evacuation
of injured.
	   So far, 91 severely injured people were flown out on the tiny
helicopters to local clinics or to the two-story hospital in
Faisabad, which is struggling with shortages of medicine and food.
Patients have beds, but the wards and corridors are crammed with
relatives.
	   In their brief stops, aid workers have found many injured people
who have not come forward for help or treatment, said Red Cross
official Juan Martinez. In one village, one team found a woman with
severe bruises over half her face. But she did not want to be
touched by a male doctor, he said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest old marque of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, looks like it's about to have German bosses behind the
wheel.
	   Shareholders in corporate parent Vickers PLC gathered Friday to
vote on Volkswagen AG's 430 million pound (dlrs 700 million) bid
for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. that management has accepted.
	   The deal appeared headed for approval, after a tough fight
against rival bidder BMW and emotional objections from some
Rolls-Royce and Bentley owners who did not want to see the producer
of the fabled hand-made cars fall under foreign ownership.
	   ``It is a very sad day,'' shareholder Paul Mallier said,
arriving for Friday's meeting. ``It's a part of English history and
tradition going.''
	   Even more angry, investor Ralph Humphreys called the chairman a
traitor, adding ``I am a true Briton. We didn't go through the war
for nothing.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ A simple, tragic car accident, caused by a drunk
driver. Is that the whole answer?
	   That's what Judge Herve Stephan wants to find out Friday from
the key witnesses in the Princess Diana case: the photographers
under investigation, their lawyers, and Mohamed Al Fayed.
	   Stephan summoned the parties for a closed-door hearing to try to
clarify the main question in the case: Who was at fault?
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But what was the responsibility of the paparazzi trailing
Diana's Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and a press motorcyclist have been placed
under formal investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for
both manslaughter and failing to come to the aid of a person in
danger.
	   The hearing which brings together nearly all of the major
figures in the case was likely to stand as an important step.
	   Even Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, showed up for the
hearing.
	   Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a Mercedes,
surrounded by four other cars and about 10 body guards.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' Al Fayed said as
he left the Ritz Hotel for the courthouse.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said he felt annoyed.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,'' said
Arsov. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have to do their
job.''
	   Arsov was supposed to be shooting pictures Friday at the French
Open tennis tournament.
	   Police with two lists, one bearing the names of the
photographers, the other 10 witnesses, checked off the arrivals.
Eight of the witnesses showed up.
	   In contrast to previous hearings, television cameras were kept
outside the grounds of the Palais de Justice surrounded by police.
	   Those close to the case believe the photographers will soon be
exonerated _ at least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Al Fayed, the father of Dodi Fayed, has filed as a civil party
in the case, and therefore has access to documents and proceedings.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``This is a process to decide if the paparazzi should go to
trial,'' said Al Fayed spokesman Lawrie Meyer at the Palais de
Justice on Friday.
	   Mr. Al Fayed ``is still a grieving parent and is here to find
out what happened to his son,'' said Meyer.
	   In a statement issued by Meyer in London on Thursday, Al Fayed
said he was ``determined to get to the truth'' about whether the
crash was an accident or a plot to kill Diana and his son.
	   But French judicial sources said recently Al Fayed has backed
off his contention that the crash stemmed from a plot, and now
thinks the paparazzi are to blame.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   Investigators also recently conducted road tests on a race track
near Paris to reconstruct the crash. Police revealed no details of
those tests.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

Israeli soldier wounded in south Lebanon attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas wounded an Israeli soldier
in an overnight attack on an Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese and Israeli officials said Friday.
	   The guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at the Israeli
patrol near the village of Sojod inside an Israeli-occupied border
enclave in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said.
	   One soldier was wounded in the late night attack, the officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said a soldier was
``lightly wounded'' in the attack. The wounded soldier was
evacuated by helicopter to an Israeli hospital for treatment, the
spokesman said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
which is believed to have been carried out by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah group.
	   Another Israeli soldier was wounded Thursday in a roadside bomb
attack claimed by Hezbollah, which also announced a guerrilla was
killed in fighting.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to try to
oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from
the occupied zone, which Israel established in 1985 with the aim of

Suspected Basque separatist dies in shoot-out with police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUERNIKA, Spain (AP) _ A woman believed to be a member of a
militant Basque separatist group died early Friday in a shoot-out
with Spanish police.
	   A police agent was shot in the arm during the raid on a
suspected ETA separatist hideout in the town of Guernika, in the
heart of Spain's troubled northern Basque region, a police
spokesman said.
	   The woman, who was not identified, opened fire on police before
agents returned fire, the spokesman reported speaking with
customary anonymity.
	   A second suspected ETA member was injured and detained after
attempting to escape by jumping from the second floor apartment in
Pablo Picasso Street, the spokesman said.
	   Police said they later arrested 12 more people nearby and seized
firearms and cash from the apartment following the early morning
raid.
	   Authorities said the operation had destroyed the operative
capacity of an important ETA commando.
	   In recent months the government has claimed several major blows
to the ETA _ an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom. ETA has
killed five people so far this year and nearly 800 since beginning
its violent campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Telrad Telecommunications of Israel will
hook up 10,000 cellular phones in the Himalayan state of Nepal,
officials said Friday.
	   A government board accepted Telrad's bid after overturning an
earlier award to Siemens, said Sushil Kant Jha, secretary in the
communication ministry.
	   Telrad's final bid was evaluated at dlrs eight million, against
Siemens' of dlrs 11 million.
	   Though lower, Telrad's bid was earlier rejected because it
offered a different Mobile Switching System than the one specified
in the tender document. Telrad officials later convinced Nepal
Telecom Corporation (NTC) that their system met the requirements.

Trial of an Indian guerrilla leader begins next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A Bangladesh court rejected a political
asylum request and ordered an Indian separatist guerrilla leader to
stand trial on immigration charges next month, his lawyer said
Friday.
	   Anup Chetia, a top leader of an outlawed rebel group fighting
for independence of India's eastern state of Assam bordering
Bangladesh, made his asylum request Thursday in Dhaka's Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate Court, according to attorney Abdul Hasib.
	   Chetia, Secretary General of United Liberation Front of Assam,
told the magistrate he fled to Bangladesh to escape arrest by the
Indian authorities.
	   Magistrate Shamsul Huq said he had no power to grant political
asylum and set the trial for July 9.
	   Police have charged Chetia with illegal entry and unlawful
holding of Bangladeshi passports and foreign currencies. He was
arrested at a rented house in Dhaka, the capital city, on Dec. 21.
	   The trial puts on hold India's request that Chetia be extradited
to face Indian murder and kidnapping charges.
	   Human rights groups in Bangladesh oppose Chetia's extradition,
comparing his cause with Bangladesh's own independence war against
Pakistan in 1971.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee
Hwa is heading to Australia and New Zealand on his campaign to
assure the world that the former British colony still has a bright
future.
	   Tung has already taken the same message to the United States,
Japan and Britain. He arrives in Australia on June 14 for a
three-day visit, before flying on to New Zealand.
	   Now a special administrative region in the Peoples Republic of
China, Hong Kong has not completely escaped the economic troubles
that have swept many Asian countries.
	   Philip Chok, director of the Hong Kong economic and trade office
in Sydney, said Friday that the former colony had suffered a 2
percent reversal in its economic growth in the first three months
of 1998, a year for which annual growth of 3.5 percent had been
forecast.
	   Chok said in a briefing on Tung's upcoming visit, that the
original growth target for 1998 would now be difficult to achieve.
	   But he said Hong Kong's long term prospects are still good.
	   ``It is possible, in fact, that things will get worse before
they get better,'' he said. ``In fact, it is quite likely.''
	   Chok said Tung would visit Australia and New Zealand to explain
what is happening in Hong Kong.
	   ``After the transition, there are still a lot of doubts in
people's minds,'' Chok said.
	   But Chok said Hong Kong still has major public works on its
books, including construction of a new container port and virtually
doubling its railways.
	   He said Hong Kong is also undertaking very ambitious housing
projects.
	   All of these things offer important opportunities to foreign
investors, Chok said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
higher in thin trading Friday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 11.04 points, or 0.12 percent, to 8,569.47. On Thursday, the
index had slumped 260 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.47 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
445 million), down from Thursday's 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 578 million).
	   Brokers attributed the uptrend to selective bargain-hunting
following Wednesday's sharp falls in share prices.
	   They said trading remained thin because many investors were
staying on the sidelines to await the release later Friday of
employment data in the United States.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 2 Hong Kong dollars to 187.00,
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 65 cents to 26.30, and Hong Kong Telecom
rose 15 cents to 13.60.
	   Among losers, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 40 cents to 34.70,
and Hang Seng Bank fell 25 cents to 50.50.

``Whingeing Poms'' to get collective voice with launch of new
</HEADLINE>
organization

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For decades, English migrants have been
derided here as ``whingeing Poms,'' a derogatory term meaning they
complain too much about Australia: it's too hot, there are too many
flies _ it's not England.
	   But the Poms' whinges may soon have to be taken more seriously,
after the launch next week of a new organization that aims to
create one of the largest ethnic lobby groups in the nation.
	   The English were the first migrants to Australia, starting with
the first fleet of convict settlers in 1788. Now more than 870,000
English-born people live in Australia _ almost as many as the next
five biggest migrant groups combined _ New Zealanders, Italians,
Vietnamese, Scots and Greeks.
	   But unlike many other new settlers, the English had no
organization to represent them. Until now.
	   On Monday, the Queen's birthday holiday, The English in
Australia _ TEA _ organization will be launched at an afternoon tea
party complete with scones, jam, cream and cucumber sandwiches.
	   TEA is the brainchild of Claire Haines, 30, who left Devon seven
years ago with a one-way plane ticket, 50 British Pounds and a
backpack. After half a dozen trips home she eventually settled in
Canberra with her English husband and infant daughter.
	   ``So many immigrant groups openly celebrate their cultural
heritage, yet the English disappear into the wallpaper,'' she said
Friday. ``We don't get together, we don't do anything.''
	   Since writing to newspapers and airing her views on radio,
Haines said she has been inundated with calls of support from
throughout Australia.
	   ``There are so many of us we could become a powerful lobby
group,'' Haines said. ``We could probably change the result of
elections.''
	   But TEA is non-political, Haines said. It will be a non-profit
group that encourages social networks around the country, helps new
migrants and organizes cultural events.
	   Launches in other capitals will include lunches with roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding. Academics will give talks on Jane Austen and
Shakespeare.
	   In Berrima, on New South Wales state's south coast, a festival
with double-decker buses, London cabs and a speaker's corner is
planned.
	   Also in the pipeline are Wimbledon parties and FA Cup Final
nights.
	   ``We feel that embracing multiculturalism should mean accepting
and respecting that English migrants also have a distinct set of
beliefs and cultural practices to celebrate,'' Haines said.

	   DALLAS (AP) _ Harut Karapetyan scored three goals within five
minutes and the Los Angeles Galaxy beat the Dallas Burn 8-1 at the
Cotton Bowl on Thursday night.
	   The Galaxy set a team record for goals in a game and handed
Dallas its worst defeat. The Galaxy also set a Major League Soccer
record for largest margin.
	   Karapetyan scored the fastest three goals by one player in
league history. The second-half substitute found the back of the
net in the 82nd, 85th and 87th minutes.
	   Ezra Hendrickson scored twice for the Galaxy.
	   Damian scored the lone goal for Dallas in the 44th minute,
becoming the first player in league history to send a corner kick
directly into the net. The score cut the Galaxy's lead to 2-1.
	   Mauricio Clenfuegos assisted on all three of the Galaxy's
first-half goals, and MLS scoring leader Welton added a goal and
two assists.

President appoints new head for central bank

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ President Martti Ahtisaari on Friday
appointed Matti Vanhala as the Bank of Finland's new governor, to
succeed Sirkka Hamalainen who joined the European Central Bank.
	   The appointment takes effect immediately.
	   The central bank's supervisory council, which is chosen by
Parliament, on Wednesday proposed that the president appoint
Vanhala, who has a 25-year career in the bank.
	   Vanhala, 52, has been a member of the central bank's board since
1992. From 1977 to 1980, he was a member of the International
Monetary Fund's board, including its director.
	   Hamalainen, who had been governor of the Bank of Finland since
1992, resigned when she was elected to the six-member board of the
European Central Bank, which started work June 1.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Battling to overcome massive financial
problems, the Indonesian government Friday named U.S. investment
banks Goldman Sachs and Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as
overall advisers on the partial privatization of 12 state-owned
companies.
	   State-owned Companies Minister Tanri Abeng also named a list of
investment banks to assist in the sale of the 12 companies
individually.
	   The minister said 22 international institutions and 17 domestic
securities firms had submitted proposals for the sales.
	   The sell-off is in line with the terms of a dlrs 43 billion
economic bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund.
	   An IMF team is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta next week with a
view to restarting the bailout in the wake of political turmoil and
riots that climaxed last month with the resignation of ex-President
Suharto.
	   Under the IMF deal, Indonesia agreed to divest its holdings in
12 state companies to a minimum of 51 percent. Five of the
companies, PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, PT Indosat, PT Tambang
Timah, PT Aneka Tambang and PT Semen Gresik are listed on the
Jakarta Stock Exchange.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament approved four financial
deregulation bills Friday, intensifying the nation's ``Big Bang''
program of opening financial markets to greater competition.
	   The measures are designed to make Japanese financial
institutions more efficient and globally competitive, while
offering foreign financial companies wider access to the Japanese
market.
	   The Big Bang reforms, nicknamed after similar British financial
reforms in the 1980s, include the following measures:
	   _ Non-life insurance premium rates will be liberalized starting
July 1.
	   _ Banks can sell investment trust funds from their own windows
from December 1.
	   _ A ban on trading derivatives will be lifted Dec. 1.
	   _ Brokers' commission fees will be completely liberalized by the
end of 1999, while further liberalizing sales of mutual funds and
securities.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine consumer prices rose 10.3
percent in May from a year earlier using a new base year of 1994
instead of the previous 1988, the government said Friday.
	   The consumer price index was also recalibrated to reflect
changing consumer spending patterns over the past decade, with
different weightings given to the goods and services that make up
the index. Food, beverage and tobacco continue to have the heaviest
weighting, but were reduced to 55.1 percent from 58.5 percent.
	   Using the old index, inflation in May was 9.2 percent after
April inflation was revised to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent. The
May figure was the highest since June 1996, when inflation was 9.8
percent.
	   The government has set an inflation target of between 7.5
percent and 8.5 percent for this year.
	   The government said the food, beverage and tobacco component of
the new CPI rose 8.9 percent in May from a year earlier while
services jumped 15.9 percent. Fuel, light and water rose 5.0
percent.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Daiwa Bank will enter into a limited tie-up
with Chase Manhattan Bank to sell an investment account to
individual savers from August, a spokesman for Daiwa said Friday.
	   Daiwa will collect money from Japanese savers looking for higher
returns than offered on simple bank accounts and pool it into a
trust fund which Chase will manage, said the spokesman, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Daiwa already offers many similar funds which it manages on its
own. The new fund would be different only in that Chase would have
full discretion in how to invest the money collected, the spokesman
said.
	   The tie-up would be the latest in a series between Japanese and
foreign financial institutions. U.S. and European firms are
scrambling to get a foothold in Japan as a series of deregulations,
known as the ``big bang,'' is expected to give foreign companies
greater access to Japan's huge pool of personal savings.
	   Chase will guarantee the principle amount on the yen-denominated
accounts, so that investors will get back what they originally
invested even in the case of severe market decline.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fanuc Ltd., Japan's top machine tool maker, has
received an order for 390 industrial robots from automaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen of France, a Japanese economic newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The order, valued at several billion yen (dlrs several dozen
million), is Fanuc's first from a major French manufacturer, the
Nihon Keizai quoted company officials as saying.
	   Fanuc officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Beginning in September, Fanuc will deliver robots for welding,
conveying and processing to a Citroen plant in Rennes.
	   Peugeot wants to introduce a large number of robots to step up
plant automation in an effort to survive increasingly stiff
competition in the European auto industry, analysts said.
	   ___
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has floated the price of cashews
due to a shortage of nuts to keep processing plants running, an
executive of the Vietnam Cashew Nuts Association said Friday.
	   Cashews have been trading at 8,000 dong to 10,000 dong (62-80
cents) per kilogram (2.2 pounds), well up from the ceiling price of
6,500 dong (50 cents) set by the government, the executive said.
	   The executive, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
foreign sellers have raised their offer for raw nuts to more than
dlrs 700 per ton from dlrs 650 earlier.
	   He said the price has been pushed up because there aren't enough
cashews available to run the 60 nut-processing plants, which have a
capacity of more than 200,000 tons per year.
	   Vietnam produced about 110,000 tons in the February-May crop,
down from the average of 150,000-180,000 tons, largely because of
the country's worst drought in a century.
	   ___
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Telrad Telecommunications of Israel will
hook up 10,000 cellular phones in the Himalayan state of Nepal,
officials said Friday.
	   Telrad's bid was accepted by a government review board which
overturned an earlier contract awarded to Siemens, said Sushil Kant
Jha, secretary in the communication ministry.
	   Telrad's final bid was evaluated at dlrs eight million, against
Siemens' of dlrs 11 million.
	   Though lower, Telrad's bid was earlier rejected because it
offered a different Mobile Switching System than the one specified
in the tender document. Telrad officials later convinced Nepal
Telecom Corporation (NTC) that their system met the requirements.

Nuclear processing plant that took Georgia material to shut down,
</HEADLINE>
government says  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dogged by Scottish nationalists and antinuclear
campaigners, Britain's Labor Party government announced Friday it
will shut a nuclear processing plant which just months ago accepted
spent nuclear fuel from Georgia, a restive Soviet republic.
	   In a surprise announcement, the government said the Dounreay
plant on the coast of northern Scotland will accept no more foreign
nuclear material, and the facility with 1,300 people will be
rundown over several decades that it will take to process material
already there.
	   ``There is no economic case for supporting commercial
reprocessing over the longer term,'' Energy Minister John Battle
said in a statement.
	   Dounreay, which opened in 1957 and produced electricity for 30
years, will complete the reprocessing of its own material,
including nuclear waste from its reactors, the Georgia material,
and existing commercial contracts.
	   The independence-seeking Scottish National Party, running
neck-and-neck with Labor in opinion polls in Scotland, claimed
victory.
	   ``We have objected to any idea that this plant was fit enough to
deal with its own waste far less taking on anyone else's,'' said
Winifred Ewing , a Scottish nationalist lawmaker whose Highlands
and Islands constituency includes sparsely populated Caithness
where Dounreay is located.
	   The shipment of the Georgia material in April _ 4.3 kilograms
(9.46 pounds) of highly enriched uranium and 0.8 kilograms (1.76
pounds) of spent nuclear fuel _ caused a particular stir, partly
because the story broke in the United States.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain was helping to prevent
the threat of nuclear proliferation by taking material that might
wind-up with terrorists or would-be nuclear powers, and argued that
the United States and Russia have accepted far more.
	   Two days ago, Blair accused the Scottish nationalists of being
``irresponsible and extreme'' during another flap over reports that
enough uranium to make a half-dozen nuclear warheads was missing
from Dounreay.
	   The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which runs the
plant, confirmed that an internal inquiry listed 170 kilograms (374
pounds) of uranium as missing from work in the mid-60s, but said it
was a paper technicality _ the amount of material that went into
the plant was overestimated by one percent.
	   SNP leader Alex Salmond taunted the government with making a
``huge turnaround.''
	   ``Anyone with an interest in these matters has known for some
considerable time that Dounreay is not in a condition where it is
safe to take any extra nuclear material to it,'' said Salmond.
	   In the 13 months since Labor won a landslide victory over the
previous Conservative Party government, the party's popularity has
eroded in its Scottish strongholds, largely because of
disappointment with Blair's centrist policies. The SNP has been the
chief beneficiary of disgruntled left-wing Laborites.

Dollar surges amid rumors on political crisis, stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A slew of unfounded rumors about political and
financial crises in Japan pushed the U.S. dollar back above 139.00
yen on Friday. Tokyo stocks prices fell in continued light trading.
	   The dollar bought 139.42 yen in late afternoon, up 1.26 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
138.27 yen overnight. It ranged between 138.38 yen and 139.50 yen
in Friday's trading.
	   The dollar initially gained ground through cross trading, in
which foreign and Japanese institutional investors bought the
German mark against the yen, after new data showed robust German
economic performance in the first quarter.
	   But traders said the dollar's rise was accelerated when several
groundless rumors circulated in Tokyo around midday, prompting U.S.
hedge funds and Japanese trust funds to buy dollars.
	   Among the rumors were that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may
resign on charges of receiving illegal political donations when he
was finance minister, and another that a Japanese long-term credit
bank may go under.
	   ``The rumors seem totally unfounded, but nonetheless provided
another reason for players to close dollar-short positions,'' said
Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank.
	   Earlier in the morning, Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said
finance authorities will carefully watch the dollar-yen rate, and
if necessary may make the yen's weakness a topic of discussion at a
meeting of the G-7 meeting.
	   Fear of Japanese intervention to stem the yen's slide and
speculation that deputy finance ministers of the G-7 industrialized
nations meeting in Paris next Tuesday will may agree to joint
action were holding the dollar below 139.00 yen level until early
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the persistent pessimism over the health of Japan's
economy continued to weigh on sentiment on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 103.04 points,
or 0.67 percent, closing the week at 15,323.43 points. On Thursday,
the index had gained 79.47 points, or 0.52 percent.
	   In another sign of pessimism over the economy, Mitsui Wharf Co.,
a harbor-transport company, applied to the Yokohama District Court
on Thursday for protection from creditors.
	   Also hurting sentiment was a yen's weakening, which is seen
bearish for Japanese stocks as it reduces value of yen-denominated
assets against assets in foreign currencies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,201.94.
The TOPIX closed up 2.17 points, or 0.18 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.165 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.135 percent, driving its price down to 112.31 yen from 112.54
yen.

  PUERTO RICO: Dam break in Puerto Rico forces evacuations  

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A dam lock at a lake that supplies
most of San Juan's drinking water smashed open Thursday, sending
powerful torrents of water downstream and forcing hundreds of
people to abandon their homes.
	   A steel gate at the 35-year-old Lake Carraizo reservoir broke
shortly after noon (16:00 GMT), pouring water into a tributary of
the Loiza River. There were no immediate reports of injuries at the
dam, in suburban Trujillo Alto. By late Thursday, officials said
the danger had passed.
	   More than 2 million gallons of water poured from the break in 3
1/2 hours, Puerto Rico's water authority said.
	   Police and civil defense workers checked homes in low-lying
areas of the river basin to urge residents to move to higher
ground, said authority spokeswoman Zaima Negron.
  PUERTO RICO: Independence activist can't renounce U.S. citizenship
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rican independence activists
can't renounce their U.S. citizenship if they insist on living in
Puerto Rico and won't register as aliens, the U.S. State Department
has concluded.
	   Since Juan Mari Bras will do neither, Washington won't recognize
his 1994 renunciation of citizenship, Katherine H. Peterson, acting
deputy assistant secretary of overseas citizens services, told Mari
Bras in a letter.
	   The finding, released by Mari Bras on Thursday, is sure to anger
a host of Puerto Rican independence activists who have renounced
their citizenship, arguing that they are Puerto Rican citizens
instead.
	   Their cause was strengthened last year by Puerto Rico's Supreme
Court, which ruled that a local citizenship does exist in this U.S.
territory and that it entitled Mari Bras to vote in local
elections.
  BAHAMAS: Striking hotel workers flood onto bridge, blocking
traffic
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Chanting ``more money,'' hundreds of
striking hotel workers flooded onto a bridge linking Nassau to
Paradise Island resort area Thursday, backing up traffic for miles
(kilometers).
	   Police, some armed with machine guns, tried to persuade the
strikers to stop.
	   The protesters finally left the bridge after 90 minutes.
	   About 4,000 workers at five of Nassau's biggest hotels joined a
wildcat strike Wednesday to demand higher pay. Wednesday night, the
union rejected hotel owners' offer of an 18 percent raise over five
years.
	   Workers staged what they called a ``sit-in'' at the 1,250-room
Atlantis Resort belonging to Sun International and the Marriott's
Crystal Palace resort, both on Paradise Island.
	   By Thursday, many workers at the Sheraton British Colonial, the
Nassau Marriott and other hotels on Cable Beach, a Nassau resort
district, joined the strike.
  UNITED STATES: Coast Guard allows Big Red Boat to sail
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard gave the
green light for the Big Red Boat to sail Thursday, three days after
the cruise ship was grounded because it couldn't prove that it met
new fire codes.
	   The Coast Guard suspended cruises on Premier Cruise Lines'
32-year-old vessel Monday as it prepared to sail to Nassau and Port
Lucaya in the Bahamas.
	   Premier Cruise Lines failed to turn in the proper inspection
documents on time, said Marilyn Barnett, a company spokeswoman.
Inspectors have since confirmed that the ship meets new fire safety
standards.
	   ``It was something that was of great disappointment to our
passengers and certainly to ourselves,'' Barnett said.
	   The cruise cancellation left more than 1,000 angry passengers
stranded in central Florida.

Ramos advances resignation of prosecutor who urged reversal of
</HEADLINE>
Marcos conviction  

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Fidel Ramos on Friday
ordered the resignation of the government's top prosecutor, who had
recommended that a graft conviction of former first lady Imelda
Marcos be overturned.
	   Last week, Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz submitted a
courtesy resignation to Ramos effective June 30, the president's
last day in office. Such resignations allow new administrations a
freer hand in making appointments and are often not accepted.
	   But Ramos approved de la Cruz's resignation on Friday and made
it effective next Monday.
	   ``I have exercised my prerogative to make the effective date
earlier,'' he said in a letter to de la Cruz.
	   Ramos gave no reason, but there has been widespread criticism of
de la Cruz's recommendation to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that
it overturn the conviction of Mrs. Marcos, the widow of former
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Mrs. Marcos was convicted of graft in 1993 and sentenced to up
to 12 years in prison.
	   De la Cruz said he became convinced after reviewing the case
that there was no strong evidence proving Mrs. Marcos was guilty of
the charge.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he favors a pardon
or dismissal of the case against Mrs. Marcos, and some analysts
speculate that de la Cruz's abrupt turnaround was an attempt to
stay on as solicitor general in Estrada's administration.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted of graft, although she faces numerous other criminal and
civil cases related to the 20-year rule of her husband.
	   She and her husband have been accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986 ``people
power'' revolt and Marcos died three years later in exile in
Hawaii.
	   Mrs. Marcos was convicted of having granted leases on
government-owned land at improperly low rates to the Philippine
General Hospital Foundation, which she headed. The land was then
sublet to another company at much higher rates.
	   Mrs. Marcos _ who insists she did not personally benefit from
the deal _ said the money gained from the leases helped finance
construction of the Philippine Heart Center. Prosecutors did not
challenge this, but maintained that the foundation should have been
charged more.
	   A five-judge Supreme Court panel upheld her conviction in
January, but ruled that she could appeal one more time to the
entire court before going to prison. It sentenced her to nine to 12
years in prison and ordered her to pay 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.9
million) in damages to the government.
	   The Supreme Court has up to two years to decide the appeal.

Luck and rangers save British tourist from falling off Ayers Rock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A British university student thought he
was being mugged as four rangers grabbed him to stop the tourist
falling several hundred yards (meters) to the base Ayers Rock _ and
almost certain death.
	   Anthony Leedale, 23, of Blackpool, blacked out after climbing
about 1,150 feet (350 meters) up the Rock, also known by its
Aboriginal name of Uluru, along the safety chain and started to
slide back down the steep slope.
	   He was incredibly lucky to survive, one of his rescuers, ranger
Gordon Waight, said Friday, and ``incredibly lucky we were in just
the right place at just the right time.''
	   The four rangers were just 15 feet (five meters) below Leedale
and his two companions going through their regular rescue practice
when they noticed the tourist was in trouble.
	   Waight said Leedale only had a few scratches and bruises from
the accident early last month.
	   Ayers Rock _ or Uluru _ is a huge stone monolith in arid central
Australia which is one of the country's most recognizable symbols
and a destination for thousands of tourists every year.
	   There are usually a handful of deaths at the rock each year,
mostly from heart attacks occurring when people attempt the
rigorous climb.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pressure on President B.J. Habibie to
speed up an election timetable mounted on Friday after a
presidential adviser quit saying the pace of reform was too slow.
	   Habibie has pledged to push through democratic reforms in the
wake of the ouster last month of his mentor, former President
Suharto. The new leader inherited a nation wracked by political and
economic turmoil after three decades of autocratic rule.
	   Opposition figure Emil Salim, who agreed to guide Habibie on
policy decisions from time to time, said he was backing out of an
advisory panel because the 61-year-old technocrat was waffling.
	   Bowing to calls for new leadership, Habibie promised to stage
general elections as soon as possible. Then he said the poll would
take place by the end of 1999 after Parliament overhauls rigid
electoral laws from the Suharto era.
	   ``He's taking a very long time,'' Salim said in a speech Friday
at Jakarta's Atma Jaya University. He urged Habibie to hold the
general elections in December.
	   Indonesians, meanwhile, tested their newfound political
freedoms, staging a string of rallies for separate causes. A group
of ethnic Chinese launched a political party to battle the
ostracism they have suffered for decades.
	   Chinese are resented because they dominate the economy, and
rioters burned and looted hundreds of Chinese-owned shops during
unrest in Jakarta and other cities last month.
	   Uncertainty about Indonesia's political and economic future
lingers, and Salim and others say a new president, untainted by the
association with Suharto, is needed. Habibie, a former Cabinet
minister, was a close friend and ally of Suharto, who quit amid a
swell of protest against his long rule.
	   The fate of Habibie's advisory panel, made up of half a dozen
government critics, was in doubt. Prominent opposition leader Amien
Rais pulled out of it last month, saying he did not want to be
coopted by the government and could work better outside its
parameters.
	   In a meeting Thursday with university rectors, Habibie
reportedly appealed to them to curb political activity on campuses,
which were the focal point of opposition to Suharto.
	   The Jakarta Post on Friday quoted Habibie as saying he would ask
education officials ``not to allow campuses to be turned into
political arenas.''
	   In one Jakarta protest Friday, dozens of protesters shook the
gates of the U.S. Embassy, accusing Washington of interfering in
the internal affairs of their crisis-ridden country.
	   The group alleged that Washington was trying to delay the
restarting of a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout plan put together
for Indonesia by the International Monetary Fund.
	   About 30 demonstrators also marched to a toll road in a protest
against its owner, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the eldest daughter of
Suharto. They urged motorists not to pay the toll, saying Suharto
family businesses are corrupt and have sapped the economy of much
of its wealth.
	   About 150 people also rallied against Environment Minister
Panangian Siregar outside his office, saying he was a lackey of the
old government.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian Dragoslav Stepanovic has taken
over first division soccer team AEK, the Athens club announced
Friday.
	   Stapanovic, who has coached German and Spanish teams, will
replace Romania's Dumitru Dumitriu, whose cooperation with the
Athens club was suspended on April 2 after a series of poor
performances both in the Greek league and European competitions.
	   The club said Stepanovic signed a three-year contract, but
declined to announce the financial terms. Local media said his
annual income will be about dlrs 470,000.
	   AEK, one of the most popular Greek clubs, finished third last
season behind Olympiakos Piraeus and Panathinaikos Athens and will
participate in the UEFA Cup.

Japanese military chief visits Far Eastern port

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's military chief paid a visit Friday to the
Pacific port city of Vladivostok, the main base of Russia's Pacific
Fleet as part of an eight-day trip to boost military cooperation.
	   Adm. Kazuya Natsukawa, chairman of Japan's Joint Chiefs of
Staff, spent the first five days of his visit in Moscow, meeting
with Russian military officials.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto pledged last fall to increase military contacts as part
of effort to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
	   In Vladivostok, Natsukawa was to meet with regional officials
and the visit the Admiral Vinogradov anti-submarine ship. On
Saturday, he is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Pacific Fleet
Combat Glory memorial, commemorating Russian victims of two wars
fought against Japan this century.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of a dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of the war.
	   Natsukawa is expected to return to Japan on Sunday.

Mahathir: No rift with deputy
</HEADLINE>
  By ALVIN UNG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday denied there was a rift between him and his annoited
successor over the handling of the nation's economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who as finance minister has
pushed for higher interest rates while the prime minister has
repeatedly talked about lowering them.
	   ``There are no differences between the DPM and me,'' Mahathir
told reporters at the international airport upon his return from a
five-day visit to Tokyo.
	   He added, however, that interest rates were still too high.
	   ``We have seen the effect of tight monetary policy applied in
the last three months,'' Mahathir said. The government announced
last week that economic growth in the first quarter had shrunk by
1.8 percent.
	   Interest rates currently stand between 12 percent to 16 percent
in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar and the central bank have said interest rates have to be
kept high to prevent an outflow of currency reserves and to control
inflation. Malaysian businesses, however, have clamored for lower
rates, saying the high cost of borrowing was choking growth.
	   The policy dissonance over interest rates has been watched
closely because earlier this week Mahathir had said he would step
down as Asia's longest-serving leader once the currency turmoil had
stabilized in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Mahathir has continued to rebuff the International Monetary
Fund's call for higher interest rates, saying that the agency's
reform policies could eventually debilitate the country's
businesses and economic growth.
	   The IMF says Malaysia needs higher interest rates to stabilize
the currency, which has depreciated by more than 35 percent since
the currency crisis struck last July.
	   Anwar has continued to call for a tough monetary policy, high
interest rates and taxes _ a move which Mahathir and his closest
economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, say would derail the nation's
economic recovery.

Report: Kurdish rebels kill 20 Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey _ Kurdish guerrillas said they killed 20 Turkish
troops in a raid in northeastern Iraq earlier this week, a
pro-Kurdish paper reported on Friday.
	   Turkey launched a new offensive against Kurdish rebels in
northern Iraq two weeks ago.
	   The guerrillas killed the soldiers in a surprise attack on a
Turkish military unit near the village of Yekmal in the Metina area
on Wednesday, the daily Ulkede Gundem said.
	   Military officials were not available for comment.
	   Turkish troops have gone into northern Iraq several times in the
last few years, trying to wipe out the rebel presence. Each time
they withdraw, the guerrillas return to the mountainous terrain.
	   Also on Wednesday, the rebels killed 20 Democratic Party
fighters near the village of Gise also in Metina, the newspaper
said. The rebels put their own loses at two.
	   Democratic Party is allied with Turkey against the Kurdish
rebels, and sees the rebels as a challenge to their authority in
the area.
	   Baghdad lost control over the region following the Gulf War and
Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast took
advantage of the power vacuum by setting up bases to launch
cross-border attacks at Turkey.
	   The Turkish-Kurdish war has claimed some 37,000 lives since
1984.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fanuc Ltd., Japan's top machine tool maker, has
received an order for 390 industrial robots from automaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen of France, Fanuc said Friday.
	   The order is Fanuc's first from a major French manufacturer, and
it would help Fanuc develop a new market in Europe, said Masayuki
Tomita, a Fanuc spokesman. He refused to say how much the order is
worth.
	   Japan's leading economic newspaper Nihon Keizai said the order
is several billion yen (dlrs several dozen million), quoting
unnamed company officials.
	   Beginning in September, Fanuc will deliver robots for welding,
conveying and processing to a Citroen plant in Rennes, Tomita said.
	   Peugeot wants to introduce a large number of robots to step up
plant automation in an effort to survive increasingly stiff
competition in the European auto industry, analysts said.

  Eds: UPDATES with three soldiers killed, 5 others wounded in
separate clash with Muslim rebels in Lanao del Norte province  

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Muslim rebel leader and
his followers resisted an attempt by 200 government agents to
arrest him Friday in a clash that left two people dead and two
wounded, including a 4-month-old girl, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, an army team sent to help another army patrol pinned
down by Muslim rebels was ambushed in another southern province.
Three soldiers were killed and five wounded, the army reported.
	   Police said about 200 soldiers and police were sent to the
village of Taluksangay near Zamboanga to serve an arrest warrant on
Kamlon Awolon, who faces kidnapping, extortion, murder and robbery
charges.
	   Awolon, who was expected to resist arrest, is a former commander
of the Moro National Liberation Front, which signed a peace pact
with the government in 1996.
	   Brig. Gen. Dominador Resos said Awolon and his men shot at the
arresting officers. In an exchange of gunfire, a former rebel and
the wife of another ex-rebel were killed and a 4-month-old baby
girl being carried by her mother was wounded.
	   A government agent who led the police to Awolon's house was also
wounded, police said.
	   Awolon and the rest of his men broke through the security cordon
and escaped, Resos added. They were being pursued by police, he
said.
	   In the ambush in Lanao del Norte province, Lt. Ruben Dangpilen
and two of his men were killed by Moro Islamic Liberation Front
guerrillas in Sapad, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) northeast of
Zamboanga, the military said.
	   Five of Dangpilen's men were also wounded, the armed forces
headquarters reported in Manila.
	   The report did not say if there were casualties on the rebel
side.
	   The MILF is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups still fighting
the government. The other is the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf.
	   The government has begun peace talks with the MILF but the talks
have been put on hold until President-elect Joseph Estrada takes
office on June 30.

Air France strike into fifth day as labor unrest spreads

  Eds: UPATES with pilot union spokesman saying `back to zero',
clarifies to show talks resume at 1600 GMT; show rail conductors'
strike means only reduced service

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup looming, Air France officials
and pilots worked to end a strike that has threatened to disrupt
the global soccer tournament, negotiating into the early hours
Friday and setting new talks for evening.
	   Railway conductors demanding higher pay called their own work
stoppage until Saturday morning, forcing reduced service on
numerous lines.
	   That was but the latest in a series of strikes disrupting the
pace at a critical moment. Hundreds of thousands of visitors were
expected in France for the soccer championships, along with summer
tourists.
	   The third round of talks between Air France and pilots' unions
began at the company's Paris headquarters about 7 p.m. Thursday and
ended at 4:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). There were no signs of an immediate
breakthrough as the strike entered its fifth day Friday.
	   A new round of talks was set for 6 p.m. (1600 GMT).
	   Negotiators will ``start nearly at zero,'' said the spokesman
for the main pilots' union, the SNPL. Christian Paris was referring
to what he said was a ``very clear toughening'' of the position of
Air France.
	   ``We have avoided the worst by maintaining the essential,''
Paris said, ``that is, we didn't reach the point of collapse.''
	   After the talks, Rene Philippeau, a pilot's spokesman, said the
proposals made by Air France were ``much too vague'' and thus
``unacceptable.''
	   Air France spokesman Francois Brousse, speaking to reporters
after Thursday's meeting began, maintained there were
``constructive foundations'' for an agreement to prosper.
	   The pilots are prepared to strike for at least 15 days,
coinciding with the start of the June 10-July 12 soccer
championship which will attract an estimated 1 million visitors.
	   Despite the strike, Air France, the World Cup's official
carrier, has guaranteed transport for the 32 teams taking part.
	   With just six days until the World Cup begins, France is plagued
by labor disputes.
	   Railway conductors went on strike Thursday evening and planned
to continue their action until 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Saturday. The
state-run SNCF train authority expected reduced service on
so-called ``fast trains'' and on regional lines.

Mahathir: No rift with deputy
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with more details, Moody's rating, yen loan  
  By ALVIN UNG  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Friday denied there was a rift between him and his annoited
successor over the handling of the nation's economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who as finance minister has
pushed for higher interest rates while the prime minister has
repeatedly talked about lowering them.
	   ``There are no differences between the DPM and me,'' Mahathir
told reporters at the international airport upon his return from a
five-day visit to Tokyo.
	   He added, however, that interest rates were still too high.
	   ``We have seen the effect of tight monetary policy applied in
the last three months,'' Mahathir said. The government announced
last week that economic growth in the first quarter had shrunk by
1.8 percent. In the last quarter of 1997, the economy grew by 6.9
percent.
	   The international rating agency Moody's on Friday said it was
reviewing for possible downgrade Malaysia's debts denominated in
foreign currency. A lower rating would make borrowing foreign
currency more expensive for Malaysia.
	   Interest rates currently stand between 12 percent to 16 percent
in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar and the central bank have said interest rates have to be
kept high to prevent an outflow of currency reserves and to control
inflation. Malaysian businesses, however, have clamored for lower
rates, saying the high cost of borrowing was choking growth.
	   The policy dissonance over interest rates has been watched
closely because earlier this week Mahathir had said he would step
down as Asia's longest-serving leader once the currency turmoil had
stabilized in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Mahathir, prime minister for 17 years, has continued to rebuff
the International Monetary Fund's call for higher interest rates,
saying that the agency's reform policies could eventually
debilitate the country's businesses and economic growth.
	   The IMF says Malaysia needs higher interest rates to stabilize
the currency, which has depreciated by more than 35 percent since
the currency crisis struck last July.
	   Anwar has continued to call for a tough monetary policy, high
interest rates and taxes _ a move which Mahathir and his closest
economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, say would derail the nation's
economic recovery.
	   Mahathir on Friday also said Malaysia was planning to get dlrs 1
billion to dlrs 2 billion worth of loans in Japanese yen. He didn't
offer any further details, though Thursday he was reported as
saying yen loans would be taken out by the government and private
sector.

North Korea says no missing Japanese in its territory
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Japanese reaction, 5-7 grafs bgng `In Tokyo,
Chief Cabinet...,'  

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea said Friday a lengthy
investigation found no evidence that missing Japanese citizens are
in its territory, despite allegations of kidnappings by its agents.
	   Acting on Japanese requests, North Korea's Red Cross and
government have conducted an ``intensive'' five-month search for 10
missing Japanese since early this year, said the North's official
Korean Central News Agency.
	   But none of those sought by Japan was found, a North Korean Red
Cross spokesman told KCNA.
	   ``The results of the search finally proved that the persons
wanted by Japan do not exist in the (North Korean) territory and
that they never entered nor temporarily stayed here,'' the
spokesman said.
	   In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka was quoted as
saying the North Korean announcement was ``extremely deplorable''
and that Japan can not accept the results of the North Korean
investigation.
	   ``Japan intends to persistently ask North Korea to handle the
issue seriously and honestly,'' Muraoka was quoted as saying by
Kyodo News.
	   Ruling Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Koichi Kato was quoted
by Kyodo as saying North Korea's failure to properly investigate
the case of the abducted Japanese could hurt negotiations to
normalize ties between Japan and the North.
	   The status of the 10 missing Japanese is a key pending issue
between Japan and North Korea, which have no diplomatic ties.
	   Talks aimed at normalizing Tokyo-Pyongyang relations have
stalled over the issue of the missing persons. Japan believes that
North Korean agents abducted the Japanese, including a 13-year-old
girl, over the past two decades to use them as language teachers
for their spies.
	   North Korea has dismissed the alleged kidnappings as ``faked-up
cases.''
	   But during talks with a delegation of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's ruling coalition last November, Pyongyang's ruling
(communist) Workers Party agreed to launch an investigation.
	   Police and other officials conducted the search throughout North
Korea ``in a responsible way from the humanitarian point of view,''
the Red Cross spokesman told KCNA.
	   They investigated the personal data of all foreign citizens
staying in North Korea and naturalized people as well as their
families overseas, comparing them with identities of the 10 people
sought by Japan, he said.
	   North Korea resents Japan's colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, support for the United States in the
1950-53 Korean War, and close ties to the rival South Korean
government.
	   After tortuous negotiations, North Korea allowed 15 Japanese
women married to North Korean men to visit Japan late last year and
early this year. Their visits were the first of their kind.
	   On Friday, North Korea demanded that the Japanese Red Cross help
find out the fates of many Korean women forced to work as sex
slaves in front-line brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army
during World War II.

Three students charged with killing police officer freed
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police have conditionally
released three university students accused of beating a police
intelligence officer to death during a recent anti-government
protest.
	   The three students from Djuanda University were freed Thursday
in West Java town of Bogor, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of
Jakarta, police said Friday.
	   Lt. Col. Ruslan Riza, Bogor's police chief said the three still
faced murder charges.
	   Police accuse them of killing a plainclothes policeman during an
anti-government protest on May 9.
	   However, an autopsy later found the officer had died of a heart
attack.
	   ``Whether they are convicted on not will be decided by the
court, not merely by the autopsy.''Riza said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 20 people were missing and feared dead
after a ferryboat capsized in south China's Guangdong province, the
Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.
	   A privately run ferry designed to carry 10 people had about 30
on board, most of them miners, when it tipped over Thursday morning
while halfway across the Zhen river in Chaoguan city. Other ferries
rescued 11 people, and about 20 were reported missing, the
state-run news agency said.
	   Police arrested the owner of the boat, the report said.

Settlers intensify campaign against West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
  By KARIN LAUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Senior members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Likud Party flew over the West Bank on Friday in planes
chartered by Jewish settlers trying to scuttle an Israeli troop
pullback in the disputed territory.
	   Settler leaders have intensified their campaign among growing
signs that Netanyahu is close to accepting a U.S. plan that would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full or partial Palestinian
control and restrict Jewish settlement expansion.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister would present a possible agreement to parliament, even
though he is not required to do so. ``Even if there is a risk of
coalition problems, if he feels that the package deal is good, he
will present it,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   An agreement is likely to pass with the votes of the dovish
opposition. However, far-right lawmakers have said that if
Netanyahu agrees to a withdrawal, they would try to bring him down
at the next opportunity, in this case the next motion of no
confidence in the government.
	   The opposition would vote against the government in such a
motion, and would be joined by at least 10 legislators from the
hawkish Land of Israel Front, enough to deprive Netanyahu's
66-member coalition of a majority in the 120-member parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Friday that Netanyahu would soon try to
form a national unity government in which the opposition Labor
Party would serve as a junior partner. Such a coalition would have
to be formed immediately after a parliament vote on a troop
withdrawal and before the next motion of no confidence.
	   The Jewish settlement movement, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to
block a withdrawal.
	   On Friday, dozens of members of the Likud Central Committee were
flown across the West Bank in planes chartered by settlers trying
to persuade them to oppose any pullback as a danger to Israel's
security. Maps in hand, they were given explanations by settler
guides, said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   Domb said the aim was to generate support for holding a Likud
convention that would vote on a withdrawal. Most Central Committee
members are staunch Netanyahu supporters and it was not clear
whether they would go against him on a major policy decision.
	   Last week, settlers began mailing 1 million brochures containing
West Bank maps to Israeli homes in hopes of turning public opinion
against a troop pullback.
	   In diplomatic activity, two senior Palestinian negotiators
returned Friday from two days of meetings in London with the U.S.
envoy, Dennis Ross, and were to brief Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. Details on London talks were not immediately available.
	   Israel army radio said Ross asked the two Palestinians, Arafat
deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia, to accept
some changes in the original U.S. proposal that had been approved
by the Palestinians. Abbas and Qureia reportedly said they would
not agree to deviations from the original plan.
	   In other developments:
	   _ Israel's Antiquities Authority signed an agreement with a
Jewish settler group, Ateret Cohanim, to carry out a joint salvage
dig on a plot of land in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's walled
Old City. The deal formalizes the group's presence on the land.
Last week, municipal workers tore down seven shacks erected by
Ateret Cohanim as part of their campaign to establish Jewish
bridgeheads in Arab neighborhoods of the disputed city.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Serbian Dragoslav Stepanovic has taken
over first division soccer team AEK, the Athens club announced
Friday.
	   Stapanovic, who has coached German and Spanish teams, will
replace Romania's Dumitru Dumitriu, whose cooperation with the
Athens club was suspended on April 2 after a series of poor
performances both in the Greek league and European competitions.
	   The club said Stepanovic signed a three-year contract, but
declined to announce the financial terms. Local media said his
annual income will be about dlrs 470,000.
	   AEK, one of the most popular Greek clubs, finished third last
season behind Olympiakos Piraeus and Panathinaikos Athens and will
participate in the UEFA Cup.

Rights prize goes jointly to Italian, Turkish, Ulster activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The Council of Europe has awarded its
1998 European human rights prize jointly to two organizations - one
Turkish and one Northern Irish - and an Italian activist.
	   The prize was awarded Thursday to the Human Rights Foundation of
Turkey, the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of
Justice in Northern Ireland and Chiara Lubich, an Italian human
rights activist.
	   They will get the award at a Sept. 2 ceremony commemorating the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Lubich founded the Focolare Movement in 1943. Present in 180
countries, it ``works for unity among people through dialogue and
concrete action in favor of peace without frontiers,'' the Council
of Europe said.
	   It lauded the Turkish group for its ``outstanding'' contribution
to the protection of human rights in Turkey since 1990 and said the
Northern Irish group, set up in 1980, ``has worked impartially to
defend the human rights of all in Northern Ireland.''
	   The award is intended to ``uphold the merits of a person, group
of persons, institution or non-governmental organization which has
been active in promoting or protecting human rights in accordance
with the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and
the rule of law.''
	   Past winners include former Polish president Lech Walesa and
Russia's former human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov.
	   The Council of Europe was created in 1949 and is best known for
its European Human Rights Convention.

	   GUERNICA, Spain (AP) _ A woman believed to be a member of the
armed separatist group ETA died in a shoot-out with police early
Friday, authorities said.
	   A police agent was shot in the arm in the exchange of fire
triggered by a raid on a suspected separatist safehouse the town of
Guernica located in the heart of Spain's troubled northern Basque
region, a police spokesman said.
	   The woman shot at police prompting agents to return fire before
she fell to the ground, the spokesman reported with customary
anonymity. He refused to confirm reports on national Spanish
television that identified her as Ignacio Ceberio.
	   A second suspected ETA member was injured and detained after
attempting to escape by jumping from the second floor apartment in
Pablo Picasso Street, the spokesman said.
	   Police said they arrested a further 12 people later in the
morning in the surrounding area and seized firearms and cash from
the apartment following the raid that took place at 2 a.m.
(0000gmt).
	   Authorities said the operation had destroyed the operative
capacity of an important ETA commando.
	   In recent months the government has claimed several major blows
to the ETA _ an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom. ETA has
killed five people so far this year and nearly 800 since beginning
its violent campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.

Soccer stars return home after being dropped from national squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's biggest soccer stars returned home
Friday after the surprise announcement this week that they had been
dropped from Japan's World-Cup-bound national soccer team.
	   Veteran forward Kazuyoshi Miura, 31, and midfielder Tsuyoshi
Kitazawa, 29, told a press conference in Tokyo that their lives
would go on and that they remained with the national team in
spirit.
	   ``Our pride as national team members and our soul are still (in
France),'' said Miura.
	   Miura's failure to make the team came as a particular shock in
Japan and was front-page news in many Japanese newspapers.
	   Miura _ or ``Kazu'' as he is known in Japan _ had long enjoyed a
reputation as Japan's top player and is the country's second
all-time goal-scorer in international matches.
	   But his form has suffered lately and his performance was
lackluster during the World Cup qualifying rounds.
	   Miura has also played for the Brazilian soccer team Santos and
spent a year on the roster of the Italian serie-A club Genoa.
	   Miura and Kitazawa both play for the Japanese league team Verdy
Kawasaki.
	   Defender Daisuke Ichikawa, 18, who plays for the Shimizu
S-Pulse, was also axed from the final selection.

Dozens of Germany's fast trains idled after crash

part found near crash, comment from survivor, edits and trims

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years.
	   The confirmed _ possibly final _ death toll rose to 95 after
rescue crews recovered two bodies early Friday from the last major
part of wreckage to be excavated, a dining car that was buried when
an overpass collapsed during Wednesday's pileup.
	   ``It would appear that the restaurant car was closed for some
reason, otherwise there would have been more people in it,''
Eschede police spokesman Joachim Haack told reporters Friday.
	   Police spokesman Peter Hoppe said rescuers did not expect to
find more bodies. Ninety-two were recovered at the scene, and three
people died in hospitals.
	   A special commission of police, rail and other experts,
supervised by prosecutors, were working to identify the cause of
the disaster, and investigators were aggressively searching for
evidence in an area extending 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) down the
line, Haack said.
	   ``I think at this moment we can say it's a mechanical reason,''
Haack said.
	   Horst Stuchly, president of the federal railway office, said
Thursday that a break in a wheel was emerging as a possible cause.
	   Attention centered on the steel ``tires'' which are fitted to
the wheels, and which must be replaced from time to time. The
flanged tire is the part of the wheel which is in direct contact
with the rail.
	   The mass-circulation Bild daily quoted Johannes Ludewig,
director of the federal railways, as saying that a piece of a wheel
was found 6 kms (3.7 miles) from the bridge.
	   Police in Celle said parts from a train were found six
kilometers (3.7 miles) from the bridge, but they gave no details.
	   State authorities originally estimated that as many as 100 or
more were killed when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884
derailed at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour near the small town
of Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   Whatever caused the accident set off a catastrophic chain of
events: part of the train knocked down a highway overpass, the
collapsing bridge crushed some of the trailing cars, and the rest
of the train jackknifed against the concrete.
	   State officials said 200 people were injured, of whom 95 were
treated in hospitals. Survivors have told of loud noises or
vibrations for a minute or more before the accident.
	   ``Before everything happened, I felt a rumbling and suddenly a
horrible cracking. The lights went out and the carriage sprang from
the tracks,'' said Angelika Hauser, 32, a pharmacist from Augsburg.
	   Hauser, who was quoted in Bild, suffered a fractured skull and
broken back.
	   ``I remember only that people and seats were all over the
place,'' an unidentified woman told n-tv television in one of the
first interviews with one of the scores of injured survivors
evacuated to hospitals in helicopters.
	   Police found nicks in concrete ties and trackside signal
equipment which confirms that some part of the train had derailed
before reaching the bridge.
	   Five cars got through the overpass, though the back end of the
fifth car was torn off. The lead locomotive broke free of its cars
and the driver apparently was unaware of any mishap until the
station master at Escheden activated an emergency brake.
	   Deutsche Bahn removed all 60 of its first-generation InterCity
Express trains, introduced in 1991, from service after they
finished their runs Thursday, idling more than half of the nation's
fastest trains.
	   Forty-three trains introduced since 1996 remained in service. It
was unclear how quickly normal service would resume.
	   ``We are going to do everything possible to make sure that this
tragic accident won't happen again,'' rail spokesman Martin Katz
said.
	   Earlier, officials lowered the speed limit for all ICE trains
from 280 kilometers (175 miles) per hour to 160 kph (100 mph) until
the entire fleet could be inspected.
	   There were one- to three-hour delays Thursday along the
3,500-kilometer (2,175-mile) ICE system.
	   Germany's deadliest train accident prior to Wednesday's
derailment came in 1967, when 94 people were killed after a barrier
closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline, causing it to
explode.

Sudan holding gunmen who attacked Mubarak, Egypt says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan is harboring three Muslim militants
wanted in the 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, a senior Egyptian official was quoted as saying
Friday.
	   ``These elements have a presence in and a relationship with
Sudan,'' Interior Minister Habib el-Adly told the London-based
Al-Hayat newspaper in an interview.
	   The Minister's comments were the toughest accusation against
Sudan since the two countries began last summer patching up
relations that plummeted after the attack against Mubarak in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   At the time Sudan denied it was harboring the gunmen who took
part in the attack. It said they were not in the country.
	   In recent weeks Egyptians have complained that Sudan has failed
to hand over Muslim militants, but this is the first time an
official has specified the demand was for militants involved in the
attack against Mubarak.
	   Egypt demanded improved security cooperation between the two
countries as a condition for improved relations, and diplomats and
security officials began shuttling between the two countries last
summer.
	   The relationship recently hit a new rough spot over Egypt's
demand for the return of its properties in Sudan, some of which the
Sudanese government is now using for other purposes.

U.N. court to rule in Cameroon-Nigeria border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court said Friday it
will rule next week whether it has the authority to decide a bitter
territorial dispute between feuding West African neighbors Nigeria
and Cameroon.
	   Cameroon has asked the court, the United Nations' highest
judicial body, to resolve a quarrel over the oil-rich Bakassi
peninsula that once brought the two nations to the brink of war and
has led to scattered armed clashes.
	   Cameroon, which took the case to the World Court in early 1996
after a series of bloody skirmishes, has asked the 15-judge panel
to order an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian
troops and has demanded reparations.
	   But Nigeria, a West African political and petroleum giant,
contends the countries should settle all boundary disputes
themselves. It has challenged the court's authority to get
involved, claiming it has no jurisdiction.
	   The court will release its decision on June 11 on whether to
proceed further with the merits of the case, and on whether
Cameroon's case is admissible. If so, a definitive ruling would not
come for several more years.
	   Both nations claim ownership of the peninsula jutting into the
Gulf of Guinea where their borders meet. They laid out their
preliminary arguments before the court in March.
	   The neighbors almost went to war over Bakassi in 1981, and there
have been scattered hostilities ever since.
	   Last month, Nigeria accused Cameroon of trying to enlarge its
borders and provoke war by amassing more than 2,000 troops on
Bakassi, and by allegedly attacking unarmed villagers in the
disputed section of the peninsula.
	   Unconfirmed clashes between Nigerian and Cameroonian soldiers in
the region reportedly flared in April, resulting in the deaths of
at least 18 people. At least 87 people have been killed in sporadic
clashes since 1994, in open defiance of a 1996 World Court order to
cease hostilities.
	   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
has no enforcement powers and relies on nations to voluntarily
comply with its rulings.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It's hot. You're thirsty. There's a vending
machine, but you don't have any change.
	   What to do?
	   Whip out the Nokia Card Phone, dial the vending machine's phone
number, and out pops a Coca-Cola. The cost of the drink shows up on
the mobile phone bill.
	   Plans are underway for commercial trials of the vending machine,
on display at Nokia's showroom during the CommunicAsia '98 trade
fair, which ends Saturday.
	   ``The Nokia Card Phone used in this unique vending machine turns

Settlers intensify campaign against West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
  By KARIN LAUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Senior members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Likud Party flew over the West Bank on Friday in planes
chartered by Jewish settlers trying to scuttle an Israeli troop
pullback in the disputed territory.
	   Settler leaders have intensified their campaign among growing
signs that Netanyahu is close to accepting a U.S. plan that would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full or partial Palestinian
control and restrict Jewish settlement expansion.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister would present a possible agreement to parliament, even
though he is not required to do so. ``Even if there is a risk of
coalition problems, if he feels that the package deal is good, he
will present it,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   An agreement is likely to pass with the votes of the dovish
opposition. However, far-right lawmakers have said that if
Netanyahu agrees to a withdrawal, they would try to bring him down
at the next opportunity, in this case the next motion of no
confidence in the government.
	   The opposition would vote against the government in such a
motion, and would be joined by at least 10 legislators from the
hawkish Land of Israel Front, enough to deprive Netanyahu's
66-member coalition of a majority in the 120-member parliament.
	   Israeli media speculated Friday that Netanyahu would soon try to
form a national unity government in which the opposition Labor
Party would serve as a junior partner. Such a coalition would have
to be formed immediately after a parliament vote on a troop
withdrawal and before the next motion of no confidence.
	   The Jewish settlement movement, however, stepped up efforts to
block a withdrawal.
	   On Friday, dozens of members of the Likud Central Committee were
flown across the West Bank in planes chartered by settlers trying
to persuade them to oppose any pullback as a danger to Israel's
security. Maps in hand, they were given explanations by settler
guides, said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   Last week, settlers began mailing 1 million brochures containing
West Bank maps to Israeli homes in hopes of turning public opinion
against a troop pullback.
	   In diplomatic activity, two senior Palestinian negotiators
returned Friday from two days of meetings in London with the U.S.
envoy, Dennis Ross, and were to brief Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. Details on London talks were not immediately available.
	   Israel army radio said Ross asked the two Palestinians, Arafat
deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia, to accept
some changes in the original U.S. proposal that had been approved
by the Palestinians. Abbas and Qureia reportedly said they would
not agree to deviations from the original plan.

New Swiss bank chief hopes merger complete late June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The designated chief executive officer
of planned banking giant United Bank of Switzerland was quoted
Friday as saying he expects the merger to be completed around the
end of June.
	   In an interview with the Basel daily Basler Zeitung, Marcel
Ospel also said that merging partners Union Bank of Switzerland and
Swiss Bank Corp. had lost some 2 percent of their total 5 million
customers since the merger was announced six months ago.
	   But the new bank ``lost practically no customers abroad,'' Ospel
was quoted as saying.
	   He welcomed Thursday's vote by New York State banking
authorities to allow the two Swiss banks to combine their New York
operations, and expressed confidence the new bank will clear the
final hurdle of approval by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
	   Shareholders of both banks approved the merger in February, and
the Swiss government has also approved it.
	   The new United Bank of Switzerland would be the world's second
largest bank with assets of dlrs 627 billion, behind Japan's Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The move will cost 13,000 jobs of the 56,000 combined workforce
worldwide, more than half of them in Switzerland.
	   That process will begin with the merger's completion and ``take
place over a period of three to four years,'' Ospel told the Basler
Zeitung.
	   He stressed the new bank's commitment to Switzerland's retail
banking sector and warned that investment banking ``will be much
less attractive once the boom on world financial markets is over.''
	   The new UBS has no acquisition plans ``in the pipeline'' outside
Switzerland, Ospel said. ``First we want to consolidate.''

Ukrainian government moves against gas debtors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ In a bid to collect some of the dlrs 3.8
billion in gas debts, Ukrainian government ordered regional
officials to crack down on consumers irregularly paying their gas
bills, a news report said Friday.
	   In a resolution approved this week, the Cabinet told local
administrators to suspend gas supplies to state-run organizations
and institutions that consume gas and fail to pay for it, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Bohdan Klyuk, head of the Ukrgazprom state gas monopoly, said
his company has requested regional administrations and Interior
Ministry departments to continue gas supplies only to those
consumers who have paid up.
	   ``The administrations will either help us cut off non-paying gas
consumers or we will start suspending gas supplies to cities, towns
and villages,'' he said.
	   The state is currently owed dlrs 3.8 billion for supplied gas.
The debt situation has worsened sharply this year, with dlrs 1
billion of the debt accumulated since Jan. 1, according to the
State Oil and Gas Committee.
	   Ukraine desperately needs the money to cover its growing gas
debt to Russia, which provides much of the former Soviet republic's
energy needs.
	   The Russian side estimates Ukraine's debt at dlrs 1.2 billion.
Ukraine has pledged to pay dlrs 750 million of it by Oct. 1.

Philippine peso slips; stocks end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso slipped against
the dollar in thin trading Friday, with the local currency
underpinned by slack corporate demand for the U.S. currency,
dealers said.
	   However, participants closely watched pressure building on the
Thai baht and the Japanese yen, they said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.154 pesos for the day, up from 39.098
pesos on Thursday.
	   Considerably worse-than-expected May inflation data had little
direct impact on the peso-dollar rate, although the sharp rise in
consumer prices is expected to break the declining interest-rate
trend of recent weeks.
	   Dealers said the peso market will be closely monitoring next
week's meeting of deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations, and whether the yen tests the sensitive
level of 140 yen to the dollar early next week.
	   However, peso losses are expected to be cushioned by the
market's reluctance to buy the dollar at around 39 pesos.
	   In stock trading, shares closed mixed as selective buying offset
the negative impact of the higher-than-expected inflation data,
market participants said.
	   Sharp increases in food prices caused by the El Nino drought
pushed inflation in May to 9.2 percent from 7.8 percent in April.
The May data was based on the 1988 inflation series which will soon
be phased out.
	   The new inflation series introduced Friday uses 1994 as the base
year and showed inflation in May higher at 10.3 percent.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index edged up 3.88
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,957.76 after gaining 24.89 points on
Thursday.
	   Losers, however, were ahead of gainers 41 to 35, with 47 issues
unchanged.
	   Analysts said the absence of fresh market incentives coupled by
the damping effect of the inflation data forced many investors
further to the sidelines.
	   ``The trend is still down,'' said Nestor Aguila, president of
Market Capital and Securities Inc. ``We're more negative than
neutral at this time, particularly when it comes to external
factors,'' he added.
	   Aguila advised against bargain-hunting for the moment, warning
that the market hasn't reached bottom. ``It's like catching a
falling knife,'' he said.

Sudan holding gunmen who attacked Mubarak, Egypt says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan is harboring three Muslim militants
wanted in the 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, a senior Egyptian official was quoted as saying
Friday.
	   The Minister's comments were the toughest accusation against
Sudan since the two countries began last summer patching up
relations that plummeted after the attack against Mubarak in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia.
	   ``These elements have a presence in and a relationship with
Sudan,'' Interior Minister Habib el-Adly told the London-based
Al-Hayat newspaper in an interview.
	   At the time of the attack, Sudan denied it was harboring the
gunmen who took part. It said they were not in the country.
	   In recent weeks Egyptians have complained that Sudan has failed
to hand over Muslim militants, but this is the first time an
official has specified the demand was for militants involved in the
attack against Mubarak.
	   Egypt demanded improved security cooperation between the two
countries as a condition for improved relations, and diplomats and
security officials began shuttling between the two countries last
summer.
	   The relationship recently hit a new rough spot over Egypt's
demand for the return of its properties in Sudan, some of which the
Sudanese government is now using for other purposes.

Rights prize goes jointly to Italian, Turkish, Ulster activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The Council of Europe has awarded its
1998 European human rights prize jointly to two organizations _ one
Turkish and one Northern Irish _ and an Italian activist.
	   The prize was awarded Thursday to the Human Rights Foundation of
Turkey, the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of
Justice in Northern Ireland and Chiara Lubich, an Italian human
rights activist.
	   They will get the award at a Sept. 2 ceremony commemorating the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Lubich founded the Focolare Movement in 1943. Present in 180
countries, it ``works for unity among people through dialogue and
concrete action in favor of peace without frontiers,'' the Council
of Europe said.
	   It lauded the Turkish group for its ``outstanding'' contribution
to the protection of human rights in Turkey since 1990 and said the
Northern Irish group, set up in 1980, ``has worked impartially to
defend the human rights of all in Northern Ireland.''
	   The award is intended to ``uphold the merits of a person, group
of persons, institution or non-governmental organization which has
been active in promoting or protecting human rights in accordance
with the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and
the rule of law.''
	   Past winners include former Polish president Lech Walesa and
Russia's former human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov.
	   The Council of Europe was created in 1949 and is best known for
its European Human Rights Convention.

New Swiss bank chief hopes merger complete late June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ The designated chief executive officer
of planned banking giant United Bank of Switzerland was quoted
Friday as saying he expects the merger to be completed toward the
end of June.
	   In an interview with the Basel daily Basler Zeitung, Marcel
Ospel also said that merging partners Union Bank of Switzerland and
Swiss Bank Corp. had lost some 2 percent of their total 5 million
customers since the merger was announced six months ago.
	   But the new bank ``lost practically no customers abroad,'' Ospel
was quoted as saying.
	   He welcomed Thursday's vote by New York state banking
authorities to allow the two Swiss banks to combine their
operations there, and expressed confidence the new bank will clear
the final hurdle of approval by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
	   Shareholders of both banks approved the merger in February, and
the Swiss government has also approved it.
	   The new United Bank of Switzerland would be the world's second
largest bank with assets of dlrs 627 billion, behind Japan's Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The move will cost 13,000 jobs of the 56,000 combined workforce
worldwide, more than half of them in Switzerland.
	   That process will begin with the merger's completion and ``take
place over a period of three to four years,'' Ospel told the Basler
Zeitung.
	   He stressed the new bank's commitment to Switzerland's retail
banking sector and warned that investment banking ``will be much
less attractive once the boom on world financial markets is over.''
	   The new UBS has no acquisition plans ``in the pipeline'' outside
Switzerland, Ospel said. ``First we want to consolidate.''

Yeltsin promises to hold down inflation, but urges Russians to pay
</HEADLINE>
taxes  
  Eds: UPDATES with stock market steady Friday, tax chief to crack
down on rich and famous.  
  By MAURA REYNOLDS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin promised his countrymen
Friday that he won't let Russia's financial crisis fuel new
inflation, but said they must be prepared to do something in
return: pay their taxes.
	   ``The financial crisis threatens to destabilize the Russian
ruble,'' Yeltsin warned in his weekly radio address to the nation.
``And that means a return to rising prices and a higher cost of
living. That is something we simply can't allow.''
	   But Yeltsin said that unless Russian businesses and individuals
start accepting their responsibility to pay taxes, there could be a
return to Soviet-style ration cards and lines in the stores.
	   ``The government exists on the money paid by taxpayers,'' he
said. ``And you are right to demand effective work from the
executive, legislative and judicial powers.''
	   ``But the government is right to expect citizens to have a
responsible attitude to their obligation to pay taxes
voluntarily.''
	   Russia's financial crisis has eased this week, in part because
the government has taken aggressive actions to raise revenue,
including a surprise bond offering and issuing extremely short-term
treasury bills.
	   In a sign of confidence, the Central Bank lowered two key
interest rates late Thursday after hiking them to an unprecedented
150 percent last week. All the same, the new rates of 60 percent
are still double what they were before the crisis intensified two
weeks ago.
	   Stocks were steady in early trading Friday after regaining some
ground earlier in the week. Traders said the market appeared to be
awaiting the outcome of a Tuesday meeting when Russia's financial
woes will top the agenda at a meeting of G-8 finance officials.
	   All together, Russia's stock market is down about 50 percent
since the beginning of the year.
	   Russia's tax collection troubles are at the heart of the crisis.
The country's new tax chief has said that fewer than 3 percent of
Russian citizens filed income tax declarations last year, and tax
evasion is the norm among Russian businesses.
	   ``The time has come to demand and punish, including filing
criminal charges,'' Yeltsin said ominously. ``If we don't collect
taxes, we can't pay salaries.''
	   The tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has announced plans to crack down
on Russia's 1,000 richest citizens.
	   ``Well-known people should be examples for other citizens,''
Fyodorov told the Kommersant daily in an interview published
Friday.
	   The government's chronic inability to pay wages to state workers
has led to labor protests, including strikes by coal miners last
month that shut down parts of the country's rail system.

Red Cross advises Israel to remove tags from humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross
suggested that Israel remove identifying tags from an aid shipment
to earthquake victims in Afghanistan to avoid distribution problems
in the Islamic country, a spokeswoman for the group said Friday.
	   Israel plans to send 15 tons of tents, blankets, food and
medicine to earthquake victims on Sunday. Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aviv Shiron said a decision had not yet been made on
whether to mark the supplies as originating in Israel.
	   Israel has no diplomatic relations with Afghanistan and the
supplies are to be flown first to Dushanbe, Tajikstan and from
there delivered and distributed to Afghanistan.
	   An estimated 5,000 people were killed last weekend in the 6.9
magnitude earthquake in northern Afghanistan.
	   Helen Anderson, the deputy head of the Red Cross in Israel, said
it is routine for the group to discuss the issue of markings with
donor governments to avoid possible complications.
	   During the war in Bosnia, the European Union refrained from
tagging supplies for such reasons, she said.
	   In Israel's case, the Red Cross suggested not to mark the aid
shipment to Afghanistan.
	   ``If the objective is to distribute goods to those in need it is
better to do so without any markings,'' said Anderson.
	   ``It could cause problems not from our point of view, but
because of the reality of Afghanistan,'' she said in a reference to
the country's Islamic rulers.

London Underground union calls two-day strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ London Underground workers have called a 48-hour
strike in an attempt to gain assurances over the government's move
to privatize parts of the tube system.
	   Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, including
drivers and station staff, will not show up for shifts from 6:29
p.m. (1529 GMT) on Sunday, June 14, to 6:29 p.m. (1529 GMT) on
Tuesday, June 16, the union's leadership announced Thursday.
	   The strike threatens to cause the worst disruption to tube
services since a dispute over pay two years ago. More than 2
million travelers, including commuters and tourists, use the London
Underground every day.
	   Union members voted for the action after pressing for assurances
that conditions of service, jobs and pensions will not be affected
by plans for private firms to become involved in running parts of
the tube system.
	   ``We very much regret the inconvenience that this decision will
cause, but it is a direct result of London Underground's total
disregard of the very real concerns expressed by our members about
jobs, terms and conditions,'' said Jimmy Knapp, the union's general
secretary.
	   Knapp predicted the walkout would cause a ``complete stoppage''
on the tube.
	   London Underground officials said only that they were
considering the implications of the planned strike.

U.N. rights envoy says conditions to ensure Cambodia polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With Cambodia's elections just seven
weeks away, a top United Nations human rights envoy warned on
Friday that conditions are not yet in place to assure the world
body that the July polls will be free and fair.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, special representative for human rights in
Cambodia, said ``there are serious problems'' in meeting criteria
set by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as crucial for determining
if the polls are to be seen as credible.
	   He said that opposition parties do not have equal access to the
broadcast media _ which is under the tight control of the ruling
political party _ and there are reports of intimidation against
prospective voters.
	   At the same time there has been no progress by the government in
investigating acts of political violence, he said.
	   As many as 90 of ousted Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
supporters were killed in the wake of a coup 11 months ago,
apparently by Cambodian leader Hun Sen's forces. None of the
killers have been arrested.
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a coup d'etat last
July that shattered the tense coalition government they formed
after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   By scheduling elections for July 26, Hun Sen hopes to win back
legitimacy and aid from the international community lost after his
violent takeover. Critics charge the polls have been skewed in
favor of Hun Sen.
	   Hammarberg said a decision will likely be made in the first week
of July as to whether or not the U.N. _ which is coordinating
monitoring of the election _ will re-evaluate its role and possibly
pull out.
	   Hammarberg noted that even if the U.N. continues to oversee some
450 election monitors during the electoral campaign, the
international body could still reach a judgement after the ballots
were cast that the polls were neither free nor fair.
	   The inaugural meeting of the government body charged with
solving election-related disputes meanwhile was postponed for a
second time Friday, and officials warned that a further deadlock
could affect the polls.
	   Failure to convene the meeting of the nine-member Constitutional
Council was caused by absence of all three members appointed by
King Norodom Sihanouk, who appeared to be boycotting the meeting in
protest of the body's make-up.
	   The other six members of the Constitutional Council were
selected by the Supreme Council of Magistracy and the National
Assembly, and are affiliated with Cambodian leader Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party, leading critics to charge that the body
is skewed in his favor.
	   The former chairman of the Supreme Court, Chan Sok, who also
sits on the body, warned Friday that a further deadlock ``will
affect the elections.'' He said King Sihanouk might be asked to
intervene if the stalemate continues.
	   He said no date has been set for the next meeting.

Ukraine's trade unions warn of social `explosion'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's federation of trade unions urged
the government Friday to take immediate action to meet the needs of
striking miners and other workers or risk a social ``explosion.''
	   In a statement, the federation accused the government of
pursuing economic reform without considering the social
consequences.
	   ``To our sorrow, the authorities are not listening to the voice
of the trade unions and are not taking effective measures,'' it
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The crisis in the production sphere is deepening, the
unemployment issue is becoming more acute, the wage debt has
reached catastrophic dimensions,'' the statement said.
	   It attacked the government for a recent decision to raise
electricity and telephone rates that ``has only complicated the
situation and brought social tensions to the brink of an
explosion.''
	   The cash-strapped government has been trying to quell social
unrest since last month, which saw major strikes by coal miners and
scattered protests by teachers and other workers.
	   Demonstrations by miners demanding overdue wages continue in the
capital, Kiev, and several towns in the coal-producing eastern
Ukraine. On Thursday, the miners blocked traffic in downtown
Luhansk, a regional center in the east.
	   Besides back wages, the miners demand more state support for
their struggling industry. Parliament on Thursday instructed the
government to come up with 600 million hryvna (dlrs 300 million) to
meet some of the workers' demands.
	   The government has promised a much lower sum, 400 million hryvna
(dlrs 200 million), citing the need to slash the budget deficit.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with the key idex in Seoul surging 2.7 percent following
the landslide victory by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
ruling coalition in local elections.
	   Kim's party and its coalition partner took 10 of the 16 mayoral
and gubernatorial posts at stake in Thursday's local elections,
including the key race in Seoul, the capital.
	   Traders said the victory would strengthen Kim's political clout,
spurring him to push political and economic reforms more
vigorously. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 9.07 points
to 341.53.
	   Malaysian share prices slumped in reaction to Moody's Investors
Service Inc.'s decision to place Malaysia's foreign currency
ratings on review for a possible downgrade.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 13.56
points, or 2.6 percent, to 505.05.
	   The Malaysian ringgit slipped steadily lower against the U.S.
dollar on fears that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad could force a
change in the central bank's relatively tight monetary policy.
	   The dollar was quoted at 3.9860 ringgit, up from 3.9615 late
Thursday.
	   Share prices in Tokyo fell on persistent pessimism over the
health of Japan's economy.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 103.04 points,
or 0.67 percent, closing the week at 15,323.43 points. On Thursday,
the index had gained 79.47 points, or 0.52 percent.
	   Also hurting sentiment was the yen's weakening, which is seen
bearish for Japanese stocks as it reduces value of yen-denominated
assets against assets in foreign currencies.
	   The dollar was trading at 139.42 yen in late afternoon, up 1.26
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 138.27 yen overnight.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower on widespread
selling by foreign investors. The benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index fell 19.28 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,168.46.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher in volatile dealings. The
market's key Weighted Price Index rose 79.62 points, or 1.1
percent, or 1.1 percent, to 7,505.58.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices shares reversed early
morning gains to closed lower following a rise in local wholesale
interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 16.34 points, or
0.76 percent, to 2,135.70.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally higher in thin trading.
The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, rose
11.04 points, or 0.12 percent, to 8,569.47. On Thursday, the index
had slumped 260 points.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed as buying on some
selected issues offset the negative impact of the
higher-than-expected inflation data for May. The Philippine Stock
Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose 3.88 points, or 0.2
percent, to 1,957.76.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower amid worries over
the slide in the Australian currency, which has scared off some
foreign investors. The All Ordinaries Index fell 15.6 points, or
0.58 percent, to 2,642.8.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed mixed. The key Composite
Index rose 3.185 points, or 0.8 percent, to 409.516.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices sightly lower on profit-taking. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slipped 0.65 points to
318.16.

Red Cross advises Israel to remove tags from humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross
suggested that Israel remove identifying tags from an aid shipment
to earthquake victims in Afghanistan to avoid distribution problems
in the Islamic country, a spokeswoman for the group said Friday.
	   Israel plans to send 15 tons of tents, blankets, food and
medicine to earthquake victims on Sunday. Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aviv Shiron said a decision had not yet been made on
whether to mark the supplies as originating in Israel.
	   Israel has no diplomatic relations with Afghanistan and the
supplies are to be flown first to Dushanbe, Tajikstan, and from
there delivered and distributed to Afghanistan.
	   An estimated 5,000 people were killed last weekend in the
6.9-magnitude earthquake in northern Afghanistan.
	   Helen Anderson, the deputy head of the Red Cross in Israel, said
it is routine for the group to discuss the issue of markings with
donor governments to avoid possible complications.
	   During the war in Bosnia, the European Union refrained from
tagging supplies for such reasons, she said.
	   In Israel's case, the Red Cross suggested not to mark the aid
shipment to Afghanistan.
	   ``If the objective is to distribute goods to those in need it is
better to do so without any markings,'' said Anderson.
	   ``It could cause problems not from our point of view, but
because of the reality of Afghanistan,'' she said in a reference to
the country's Islamic rulers.

Report: Japanese ruling party official admits donations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The top policy-maker of Japan's ruling party told a
Parliament panel on Friday he accepted 225 million yen (dlrs 1.6
million) from an indicted oil dealer, a news report quoted
legislators as saying.
	   Taku Yamasaki said he received the money between 1991 and 1994
as donations for the now-defunct political faction led by the late
former Deputy Premier Michio Watanabe, according to panel members
and other legislators who attended the session, Kyodo News
reported.
	   One lawmaker quoted Yamasaki as telling the House of
Representatives' Council on Political Ethics that of the sum, a
total of 11.25 million yen (dlrs 80,000) was for himself.
	   Yamasaki, head of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research
Council, said he had invitations for entertainment by oil
wholesaler Junichi Izui several times but claimed he did not
receive any favors.
	   He also he has returned 10 million yen (dlrs 71,940) he borrowed
from Izui in 1995, Kyodo reported.
	   Izui, testifying last November at the lower house Budget
Committee, said he gave a total of 278 million yen (dlrs 2
million), 78 million yen (dlrs 560,000) of it going to Yamasaki.
	   Izui, an Osaka-based wholesaler, has been indicted with bribery,
fraud and tax evasion. He is now free on bail.
	   Speaking to reporters after Friday's testimony, Yamasaki said he
properly documented the donations under the law regulating money
used for political activities.
	   ``There is only one truth. I discussed (the situation) frankly,
and I believe they understood,'' Yamasaki was quoted as saying by
Kyodo.
	   The donations were used as part of the funds for the LDP
presidential election and Diet elections, he said.
	   Yamasaki personally requested the hearing, making him only the
second to face questioning before the panel since it was set up in
1985. LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato was questioned in September
1996 about political donations.
	   Yamasaki will not be subject to legal action even if he made
false statements during his unsworn testimony Friday. The LDP has
refused to comply with opposition demands to make him testify as a
sworn witness.

Big pre-EU summit gathering highlights `democratic' face of Europe
</HEADLINE>
  By MAUREEN JOHNSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Romanian gypsy describing discrimination. A
Bosnian telling a north England town councilor how things got
turned round in Tuzla. A Belgian talking greater autonomy with a
Welsh nationalist.
	   This is the People's Europe, a gathering of some 1,200 voluntary
workers, trade unionists, businessmen, youth organizers, groups for
the elderly, local government officials and a smattering of
lawmakers.
	   They all meet this weekend ahead of a European Union summit that
takes place in the Welsh capital of Cardiff shortly before the
union's six-month rotating presidency passes from Britain to
Austria.
	   Politically, the 1,200 delegates coming to London scarcely rank
with the prime ministers and presidents going to Cardiff. But,
emotionally, many feel they are the democratic, real face of a
wealthy 15-nation club that can seem both remote and interfering to
its 370 million citizens.
	   ``There's a whole level of cooperation going on within Europe
... literally thousands of people from desperately energetic civic
bodies who are organizing themselves on a European basis,'' said
Shirley Williams, a British former Cabinet minister who is
co-chairwoman of the London meeting.
	   Delegates include people from the EU's would-be members _ 10
East European nations and Cyprus. And some are coming from further
afield, including ethnic Albanian students from the troubled Serb
province of Kosovo showing up for sessions on conflict resolution.
	   Lady Williams, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker dismayed by Britain's
increasing isolation in Europe under Conservative Party
governments, considers Britain an appropriate host: The onetime EU
loner turned European again _ although cautiously _ following the
Labor Party's national election victory 13 months ago.
	   ``On the continent, there was a sense of despair about the
Conservative government in the last year,'' she said. ``So when the
Labor government came and said, `We're going to be polite now.
We're going to stop rubbishing everything you do' ... even if the
Labor government had done nothing at all, it would have seemed an
agreeable alternative.''
	   Not that Prime Minister Tony Blair's Britain is a fully paid-up
Euro-enthusiast. Britain is one of four EU countries that won't
adopt the EU's single currency, the euro, next year.
	   Organizers of this weekend's meeting, being funded by the EU and
the British government, hope a People's Europe gathering will be a
permanent feature associated with EU summits.
	   What critics might see as merely talking shop, enthusiasts
regard as a vital reflection of the building of a pan-European
identify for the next century on a continent that tore itself apart
in two world wars during this one.
	   Take, for example, the gypsies.
	   ``We can learn from each other,'' said Lady Williams, noting
that many West European countries provide sites with utilities for
gypsies. ``If this is not solved in East Europe, the gypsies
actually will have a strong case for saying they are political
refugees, because they are suffering discrimination.''
	   The meeting ends Sunday with participants questioning British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.

World Cup: Sheringham caught out drinking, dancing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English F.A. will investigate front-page
reports in two tabloid newspapers, backed by photos that show
England striker Teddy Sheringham in a Portuguese night club with a
cigarette in his mouth and his arm around a young woman.
	   The reports say Sheringham _ one of England's top players _
spent two straight nights in the club on the southern Algarve coast
drinking and dancing with witnesses saying he was wobbly and
staggering at 6:45 a.m.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle had told his players they were to
spend three days at home between breaking training camp in Spain
earlier this week and assembling in England on Friday.
	   The Sun said Sheringham followed the woman pictured in the front
page photographs into the women's toilet ``and made a pass'' at
her.
	   Hoddle was to meet with Sheringham later Friday.
	   ``We want to establish the facts before we make any comment,''
an F.A. spokesman said.
	   On Sunday, Hoddle dropped midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the
22-man team, saying he was out of shape. Gascoigne admitted at the
time he had been drunk the night before at a team party.
	   Meanwhile, one of England's greatest players _ Sir Bobby
Charlton _ ripped Sheringham.
	   ``I am really disappointed about Teddy and I hope he feels
suitably embarrassed,'' said Charlton, a director at Sheringham's
Manchester United team.
	   ``He has been given the responsibility of being one of our 22
players for the World Cup but is just not acting his age.
	   ``Any foreign media watching what has happened here in the last
couple of weeks, what with this and the Paul Gascoigne saga, would
say forget about England's chances in France because they don't
even have any self-discipline.''
	   ``Players should realize the World Cup is so important that you
cannot do anything in the few weeks leading up to the World Cup
because the media are picking up everything you do.
	   ``You are the focus of the whole country and if the players
don't have the common sense to behave themselves and act in a
reasonable manner it is absolutely nonsensical to think we have a
chance of winning it.''

Singapore stock market continues to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Foreign investors, wary of plunging regional
currencies, engaged in widespread selling Friday on Singapore's
Stock Exchange.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index hit its lowest
level since Jan. 13, closing 1.6 percent lower than Thursday.
	   The Malaysian ringgit and the Singapore dollar threatened to
fall below key support levels, as the Thai baht did, crashing
through the level of 43 to the U.S. dollar.
	   Dealers said a breakthrough in talks over the restructuring of
Indonesia's corporate debt was largely ignored by a market awash in
negativity. Bearish sentiment is overcoming the lure of bargains,
and dealers expect the Singapore indexes to keep falling.
	   Property shares, affected by a construction and occupancy slump,
were dumped, along with bank stocks.
	   Singapore's major banks are believed to have significant
uncollectible Indonesian loans, but their practice of withholding
information made investors even more nervous.
	   Overseas Union Bank's foreign shares shed 5.9 percent of its
value on trading volume of 4.7 million. Development Bank of
Singapore's foreign tranche lost 2.1 percent.

Israeli Arabs to boycott products made in Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a show of solidarity with the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's Arab community on Friday
announced a boycott of 120 goods made in Jewish settlements.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West
Bank and Gaza, and fear independence will be increasingly difficult
to attain with the expansion of the Jewish settlements.
	   Israel's nearly 1 million Arabs often have split identities.
While citizens of Israel, many also support the aspirations of
their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The decision to boycott settlement products was made by a group
of Israeli Arab leaders, including legislators and mayors, on
Thursday. Starting Monday, a list with 120 products to be
boycotted, including ice cream, canned foods and sweets, will be
posted in Arab-owned shops and published in Arabic-language media,
Ahmed Saad, a member of Israel's parliament, said Friday.
	   ``We expect that the citizens will fully comply with the boycott
because they are politically aware of our goal,'' Saad said.
	   Jewish settler leaders said they might retaliate by not
employing Arabs in the settlements. About 17,000 Palestinians from
West Bank and Gaza as well as thousands of Israeli Arabs work in
the settlements, the Jerusalem Post daily said.

Russian parliament ratifies European convention on minorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament ratified a European
convention Friday to protect the rights of ethnic minorities.
	   Russia signed the convention in 1996 when it joined the Council
of Europe, the continent's leading human rights organization, but
the document needed formal ratification by the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
	   ``The convention will have a serious political impact,'' said
Igor Ivanov, a deputy Russian foreign minister who presented the
convention to the house. It passed by a vote of 314-2.
	   He argued that the document will allow the government to better
protect the rights of ethnic Russians abroad, specifically in the
Baltics. Russia has long accused Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for
discriminating against their sizable ethnic Russian minorities.
	   Russia itself has over 100 ethnic groups, some of which have
clashed in recent years. The largest such conflict was the war of
secession waged by the southern Muslim republic of Chechnya, which
has been running its own affairs since the war ended in a political
stalemate.
	   While joining the Council, Russia also signed a convention
outlawing the death penalty. However, President Boris Yeltsin's
efforts to pass legislation outlawing executions have been blocked
by the Duma's hard-liners, who argue that capital punishment is
needed to rein in soaring crime.
	   According to official information, 92 people have been executed
since Russia signed the convention, but none since Yeltsin imposed
a moratorium later that year.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dogged by Scottish nationalists and antinuclear
campaigners, Britain's Labor Party government announced Friday it
will shut a nuclear processing plant which just months ago accepted
spent nuclear fuel from Georgia, a restive former Soviet republic.
	   In a surprise announcement, the government said the Dounreay
plant on the coast of northern Scotland will accept no more new
nuclear material.
	   Reprocessing material already at the facility, which employs
1,600 people, will take until 2006, and the cleanup many years
more, officials said.

Philippine inflation jumps to 10.3 percent in May
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with analyst comment

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sharp increases in food prices caused
by the El Nino drought pushed Philippine inflation to its highest
level in two years in May, the government said Friday.
	   The consumer price index, newly adjusted to better reflect
spending trends, rose by a higher-than-expected 10.3 percent
compared to a year earlier.
	   ``I was surprised at the magnitude of the increase, but not with
the trend,'' said Peregrine Securities Philippines Inc. economist
Luz Lorenzo.
	   Lorenzo said the inflation was pressured mainly by higher food
prices _ especially rice and poultry _ but campaign spending for
May 11 national elections also weighed in.
	   With the impact of El Nino subsiding, Lorenzo said the inflation
rate may have peaked in May, but could remain high for some time.
	   For the May data, the government recalibrated the consumer price
index to reflect changing consumer patterns over the past 10 years.
The base year was changed to 1994 from 1988, and the individual
weightings of the goods and services that make up the index were
also adjusted.
	   Food, beverage and tobacco continue to have the heaviest
weighting in the index, but were reduced to 55.1 percent from 58.5
percent.
	   Using the old index, inflation in May was 9.2 percent after
April inflation was revised to 7.8 percent from 7.9 percent. The
May figure was the highest since June 1996, when inflation was 9.8
percent.
	   The government has set an inflation target of between 7.5
percent and 8.5 percent for this year.
	   Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the
changes to the CPI may compel the government to adjust its existing
1998 inflation target. Inflation data are a factor in determining
interest rates and money supply.
	   Average inflation between January and April based on the new CPI
was 8.175 percent compared with 7.2 percent under the old index.

Three earthquakes shake Iceland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) _ Three sharp earthquakes shook southern
Iceland, followed by hundreds of aftershocks that continued Friday.
No injuries or serious damage were reported.
	   The quakes, which began about 1900 GMT Thursday, ranged in
magnitude from 4.3 to 5.3, said Einar Kjartansson, a geophysicist
with the National Weather Bureau.
	   By midday Friday about 1,000 aftershocks had registered over
magnitude 1, Kjartansson said.
	   ``We are measuring a shock every two minutes,'' he said. Asked
if scientists expected any more big quakes, he said, ``We cannot
exclude it, but we don't think so.''
	   The three quakes, which occurred within about four hours
Thursday night, had epicenters approximately 20 miles (30 km)
east-southeast of the capital, Reykjavik, within about 5 miles (10
km) of each other, Kjartansson said.
	   The quakes rattled crockery on shelves, and people ran out into
the streets. But there was only minor damage in one village,
Hberagerei, near the epicenter, which lost electric power, said
journalist Karl Blondal of the newspaper Morgunbladid.
	   He said rigorous building safety standards mean earthquakes of
this severity did not present a danger.
	   Iceland's southern lowlands have a history of destructive
earthquakes, Kjartansson said.

Blood donor infects 132 people with HIV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Blood donated by an 18-year-old carrier of HIV
spread the virus to 132 other people, leading health authorities to
urge stricter control of the blood supply, official reports said
Friday.
	   Alarmed by the rapid spread of AIDS, China banned the sale of
blood beginning this year. Blood collection centers are supposed to
rely solely on voluntary donations.
	   The discovery that 132 people recently had been infected by a
single person who had donated blood many times in northern Shanxi
province has raised the alarm, prompting the Health Ministry to
urge local officials to take more precautions, the Beijing Youth
Daily reported.
	   The Health Ministry reported that as of the end of March, 9,970
Chinese were confirmed to be HIV carriers. Of that number, 290 had
developed AIDS and 173 had died, the report said. That compared
with reports of 8,803 cases of HIV infection in October.
	   Government AIDS experts have acknowledged that the real number
of people infected may be as high as 200,000.
	   The HIV virus was first detected in China in 1985. About
two-thirds of reported cases of HIV infection are due to
intravenous drug use _ a growing problem in China _ with another 8
percent attributed to sexual relations, it said.
	   The rapid spread of AIDS and hepatitis prompted the government
to halt purchases of blood since sales were often made by drug
users and others at a high risk for AIDS who were desperate for
cash.

Militant South Korean labor group cancels strike plans
</HEADLINE>
  By SANG-HUN CHOE  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Abandoning its hardline stance, a
militant labor group on Friday withdrew plans for a nationwide
strike and said it will sit down for government-sponsored talks to
discuss layoffs and other disputes.
	   The decision sharply defused concern about recurring labor
unrest, which President Kim Dae-jung said will worsen his country's
financial crisis by scaring off badly needed foreign investment.
	   Kim leaves Saturday for the United States, where he will try to
drum up new investment. And his deputies had engaged in last-minute
talks to persuade labor leaders to retract their plans to call
massive strikes in car plants, shipyards and other key industries
beginning next Wednesday to protest widespread layoffs.
	   ``We agreed to cancel the strikes because the government
promised to make efforts to reduce layoffs,'' said Lee Gap-yong,
head of the maverick Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which
claims a membership of 500,000 in key industries.
	   Lee said his group will also join a government-sponsored
committee that began meeting this week to discuss layoffs and other
labor problems.
	   The committee's 15 members were supposed to be drawn from labor,
management and government. The labor confederation's
representatives had stayed away, however, demanding the government
first halt layoffs.
	   The confederation backed down when the government agreed that
the committee will discuss a key labor demand, namely cutting work
hours to reduce layoffs.
	   Management representatives immediately accused the government of
making ``unacceptable concessions.''
	   To drive home its demands, the labor group first staged a
two-day strike last week that paralyzed Hyundai Motors Co., South
Korea's largest car plant, and dozens of smaller work sites.
	   A similar committee, formed in January, agreed to make South
Korea's rigid labor markets more flexible. That subsequently led to
the adoption of a law that makes layoffs easier.
	   The new committee is supposed to follow up on what was agreed on
in January and adopt additional measures, including how to speed up
a restructuring of bloated, family-oriented Korean conglomerates,
or chaebol.
	   With unemployment rising more sharply than they expected, labor
leaders accused businesses and the government of abusing the new
labor law.
	   In accepting a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund in December, South Korea agreed to liberalize its
labor market and force the restructuring of the chaebol to make
them more competitive.
	   Government figures show that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the
end of the year.
	   Also Friday, President Kim said he will accelerate liquidation
of financially weak banks and companies and a disintegration of
South Korea's conglomerates, another labor demand.

Rabbi rules transsexual diva can be counted as a man in worship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ She's man enough for them.
	   The head of a rabbinical court ruled that Dana International,
Israel's celebrated transsexual singer, could be counted in a
minyan, the group of 10 men required for Jewish prayer services.
	   Whoever is born male remains so his entire life, the Maariv
daily quoted Rabbi Eliyahu Abergal as saying.
	   However, the sultry winner of this year's Eurovision contest
would have to become religiously observant before qualifying for
prayer group, the rabbi said.
	   Dana International, who had a sex change operation 5 years ago,
has become a symbol for the increasingly bitter rift between
Israel's secular majority and its ultra-religious minority.
	   The country's Orthodox establishment has denounced her as an
abomination while secular Israelis embraced her in a sign of
increasing mainstream acceptance of the country's gay community.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with the key idex in Seoul surging 2.7 percent following
the landslide victory by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
ruling coalition in local elections. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index rose 9.07 points to 341.53. Malaysian share prices
slumped in reaction to Moody's Investors Service Inc.'s decision to
place Malaysia's foreign currency ratings on review for a possible
downgrade. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell
13.56 points, or 2.6 percent, to 505.05. In Tokyo, share prices
fell on persistent pessimism over the health of Japan's economy.
The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 103.04 points, or
0.67 percent, closing the week at 15,323.43 points. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Battling to overcome massive financial
problems, the Indonesian government Friday named U.S. investment
banks Goldman Sachs and Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as
overall advisers on the partial privatization of 12 state-owned
companies. State-owned Companies Minister Tanri Abeng also named a
list of investment banks to assist in the sale of the 12 companies
individually. The minister said 22 international institutions and
17 domestic securities firms had submitted proposals for the sales.
The sell-off is in line with the terms of a dlrs 43 billion
economic bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fanuc Ltd., Japan's top machine tool maker, has
received an order for 390 industrial robots from automaker PSA
Peugeot Citroen of France, Fanuc said Friday. The order is Fanuc's
first from a major French manufacturer, and it would help Fanuc
develop a new market in Europe, said Masayuki Tomita, a Fanuc
spokesman. He refused to say how much the order is worth. Japan's
leading economic newspaper Nihon Keizai said the order is several
billion yen (dlrs several dozen million), quoting unnamed company
officials. Beginning in September, Fanuc will deliver robots for
welding, conveying and processing to a Citroen plant in Rennes,
Tomita said. (JAPAN-ROBOTS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The grandest old marque of British motoring,
Rolls-Royce, looks like it's about to have German bosses behind the
wheel. Shareholders in corporate parent Vickers PLC gathered Friday
to vote on Volkswagen AG's 430 million pound (dlrs 700 million) bid
for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. that management has accepted. The
deal appeared headed for approval, after a tough fight against
rival bidder BMW and emotional objections from some Rolls-Royce and
Bentley owners who did not want to see the producer of the fabled
hand-made cars fall under foreign ownership. (BRITAIN-ROLLS-ROYCE)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations on Friday agreed to trim
the testing requirements for imported telecom equipment in a pact
aimed at cutting costs and bringing new products to the market more
quickly. The Mutual Recognition Arrangement, adopted by government
ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, is part
of a program aimed at eliminating tariffs on all information
technology products by 2000. A similar agreement between the United
States and the European Union was signed May 18. The APEC agreement
allows already tested and certified products to be exported without
requirements for retesting in the import country and will speed up
marketing of technologies and products that are rapidly updated.

category codes:
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Foreign ministers of the world's five major
nuclear powers are urging India and Pakistan to meet at the
bargaining table and refrain from intensifying their dangerous
nuclear arms race. ``We have no illusions,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters after an emergency meeting
Thursday with her counterparts from Britain, China, France and
Russia. ``But the process has begun.'' A joint statement demanded
the South Asian neighbors refrain from further nuclear tests and
resolve their differences with direct talks. India, followed by
Pakistan, set off a series of nuclear tests last month, escalating
tensions on the subcontinent. Albright said such testing left the
people of India and Pakistan less secure and cost both nations
respect around the world. (UN-INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years. The confirmed _ possibly final _ death toll
rose to 95 after rescue crews recovered two bodies early Friday
from the last major part of wreckage to be excavated, a dining car
that was buried when an overpass collapsed during Wednesday's
pileup. ``It would appear that the restaurant car was closed for
some reason, otherwise there would have been more people in it,''
Eschede police spokesman Joachim Haack told reporters Friday.
Police spokesman Peter Hoppe said rescuers did not expect to find
more bodies. Ninety-two were recovered at the scene, and three
people died in hospitals. (GERMANY-TRAIN DERAILS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup looming, Air France officials
and pilots worked to end a strike that has threatened to disrupt
the global soccer tournament, negotiating into the early hours
Friday and setting new talks for evening. Railway conductors
demanding higher pay called their own work stoppage until Saturday
morning, forcing reduced service on numerous lines. That was but

presidential adviser quit saying the pace of reform was too slow.
Habibie has pledged to push through democratic reforms in the wake
of the ouster last month of his mentor, former President Suharto.
The new leader inherited a nation wracked by political and economic
turmoil after three decades of autocratic rule. Opposition figure
Emil Salim, who agreed to guide Habibie on policy decisions from
time to time, said he was backing out of an advisory panel because
the 61-year-old technocrat was waffling. (INDONESIA)
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ With thousands of people still
going hungry, relief efforts were again delayed by rain Friday, but
officials said that once the clouds lift food will begin flowing
faster to earthquake-ravaged villages in the mountains of northern
Afghanistan. The region still rumbled daily with aftershocks of the
horrific quake that struck six days ago _ the second in four months
in this forlorn and undeveloped region. Local officials estimate
the death toll at 4,700 people. International aid agencies have
still not reached dozens of damaged and isolated villages.

Black Sea forum leaders sign group's charter, declaration
</HEADLINE>
  By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Leaders from the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation forum on Friday signed a joint declaration and a
charter formally proclaiming the 11-nation group as a regional
economic organization.
	   The documents signed at the BSEC summit in the Black Sea resort
of Yalta stressed the determination of member countries to promote
peace, stability and economic cooperation in the strategic region.
	   They also spoke of advancing cooperation with the European Union
and said all BSEC nations would seek membership in the World Trade
Organization as the first step in that direction.
	   The ultimate goal of the new organization is the creation of a
European- Black Sea economic zone, the declaration said.
	   The two-day gathering in Yalta began Thursday with a meeting of
senior officials from member countries, followed by a session of
foreign ministers and bilateral meetings between heads of state.
	   The BSEC, set up in 1992 to promote regional cooperation and
economic projects, includes Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria,
Greece, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, addressing the summit, said
BSEC has already produced some joint projects in the spheres of
energy, transportation and environment.
	   He also mentioned ``ambitious'' plans to use BSEC as a link in a
future transportation system connecting China and Central Asia with
Europe, and proposed a plan for transporting Caspian Sea oil from
Azerbaijan to Ukraine via the Black Sea and then on to Europe.
	   Kuchma also called on other group members to create an
ecological safety forum, take joint measures to combat organized
crime and drug trade, and to strive for a free trade zone in the
Black Sea region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, also speaking in Yalta,
praised the decision to set up a Black Sea trade and development
bank in Greece. He also spoke in favor of setting up a free trade
zone in the region and linking BSEC electricity systems.

Turkish parliamentary commission approves secular dress code bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament's judiciary commission has
approved a proposed bill providing prison terms for men wearing
Islamic headgear in public. Approval by the full Parliament is
expected within days.
	   The measure provides for prison terms of between six months and
one year for men caught wearing turbans and other Islamic-style
headcovering and fines of up to 100 million lira (dlrs 400).
	   Women remain free to cover themselves in Islamic-style dress,
except in public offices, schools and universities.
Government-approved clerics would also be allowed to wear
Islamic-style dress.
	   The bill would also impose fines on persons posing as clerics or
religious sect leaders to between 50 million lira (dlrs 200) and
250 million lira (dlrs 1000).
	   The measure, which the commission approved Thursday on a vote of
11-10, is part of a wider package of proposals to curb Islamic
radicalism. They include increasing government control over mosques
and closing radical Islamic institutions.
	   The curbs are backed by the fiercely secular military, which has
carried out three coups since the 1960s and forced an Islamic-led
government to resign a year ago.

APEC adopts mutual recognition for telecoms equipment
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: INSERTS new grafs 4-5 with other items agreed and some
countries not implementing agreement until 2006. Picks up 6th graf,
`Industry executives ...
  By LAURINDA KEYS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations on Friday agreed to trim
the testing requirements for imported telecom equipment in a pact
aimed at cutting costs and bringing new products to the market more
quickly.
	   The Mutual Recognition Arrangement, adopted by government
ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, is part
of a program aimed at eliminating tariffs on all information
technology products by 2000.
	   A similar agreement between the United States and the European
Union was signed May 18.
	   The APEC agreement allows already tested and certified products
to be exported without requirements for retesting in the import
country and will speed up marketing of technologies and products
that are rapidly updated.
	   In a statement called ``The Singapore Declaration,'' the APEC
ministers adopted an action plan to promote electronic commerce
within the group and also called for transparent,
non-discriminatory interconnection of telecoms services from one
country to another at rates that reflect costs.
	   Industry executives, many of them attending the CommunicAsia '98
trade show that ran concurrently with the APEC meeting, praised the
agreement but regretted that some countries will not implement it
until 2006.
	   The agreement ``will boost trade in telecommunications and
information equipment goods among members of APEC, affecting
roughly dlrs 45 billion in current trade flows, or one-third of the
global market,'' the U.S. Trade Representative office said in a
statement from Washington, D.C.
	   The arrangement sets up a framework for manufacturers and
exporters to test according to the standards of the importing
country, and provides remedies for when something goes wrong.
	   The arrangement covers all equipment subject to
telecommunication regulations, including wireline and wireless,
terrestrial and satellite equipment.
	   The APEC telecommunications and information ministers released a
declaration specifying dates for 16 of the 18 member nations to put
the agreement into effect. Chile and New Zealand indicated they
would not put the agreement into effect because their regulations
are already simple enough for imports.
	   Usually, testing and certification are expensive procedures for
exporters, importers and regulators, and those costs are often
passed to buyers and users. Simplified procedures reduce costs.
	   ``At the same time, regulators need to have confidence in the
quality of testing that provides the basis for certification of
equipment,'' the U.S. Trade Representative said.
	   The agreement is part of a voluntary liberalization process that
APEC leaders launched last November in Vancouver.
Telecommunications is one of the nine sectors targeted for early
action in the first half of this year.
	   APEC trade ministers will meet in Kuching, Malaysia, on June
22-23 to discuss the remaining eight target sectors: environmental
goods and services, medical equipment and instruments, chemicals,
energy sector, forest products, fish, gems and jewelry, and toys.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Candidate members are Russia, Vietnam and Peru.

Lady Diana makes top 10 name list for Norwegian cows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Lady Diana has emerged as one of the most
popular names in Norway. For cows that is.
	   Dairy farmers in Norway frequently name their milk cows after
celebrities. After the death of Britain's popular princess last
year, hundreds of farmers paid a final tribute by naming their
beloved cows after her, the Nationen newspaper reported Friday.
	   Other names that made the 1998 top ten list for cows included
Yegorova, after Nordic skiing great Lyubov Yegorova of Russia, and
Isometsa, after Finnish cross-country skier Jari Isometsa, the only
male on the list. Such traditional Norwegian cow names as Dagros,
Litago and Rosa were also strong finishers.
	   Alexis and Krystle, from the 1980's Dynasty television series,
failed to make the top 10 for the first time in a decade.

Government imposes censorship on war reporting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ News reports on Sri Lanka's civil war
will have to be cleared by military censors, President Chandrika
Kumaratunga ordered Friday.
	   The government gave no reason for the measure, which it has used
in the past. It also did not say how long censorship would last.
	   In a statement, the government said Major General J. Nammuni,
appointed chief censor Friday, can order the closure of a Sri
Lankan media organization if it violates the regulations. It did
not specify what penalty would apply to journalists working for
foreign media.
	   Censorship, which has been periodically imposed since militants
among the country's minority Tamil took up arms in 1983, was last
imposed in April 1996. Censors deleted whatever was considered
sensitive information. Newspapers often left blank spaces on their
pages in protest.
	   Militants are fighting for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka's
north and east, claiming the Tamil minority is oppressed by the
majority Sinhalese, who control the government and the military.
The government denies the charge and accuses the main separatist
group, The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, of trying to divide
the country.
	   More than 52,000 people have been killed in the war since 1983.
	   Reporting on the insurrection is already difficult because
journalists must get approval from the defense ministry before
visiting the country's north, the main theater of the war.

Yeltsin promises to hold down inflation, but urges Russians to pay
</HEADLINE>
taxes  
  Eds: UPDATES with premier saying crisis is over; TRIMS.  
  By MAURA REYNOLDS  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin promised his countrymen
Friday that he won't let Russia's financial crisis fuel new
inflation, but said they must be prepared to do something in
return: pay their taxes.
	   His prime minister, meanwhile, declared the crisis over.
	   ``The financial crisis threatens to destabilize the Russian
ruble,'' Yeltsin warned in his weekly radio address to the nation.
``And that means a return to rising prices and a higher cost of
living. That is something we simply can't allow.''
	   But Yeltsin said that unless Russian businesses and individuals
start accepting their responsibility to pay taxes, there could be a
return to Soviet-style lines and ration cards.
	   ``The government exists on the money paid by taxpayers,'' he
said. ``And you are right to demand effective work from the
executive, legislative and judicial powers.''
	   ``But the government is right to expect citizens to have a
responsible attitude to their obligation to pay taxes
voluntarily.''
	   Russia's financial crisis has eased this week, in part because
the government has taken aggressive actions to raise revenue,
including a surprise bond offering and issuing extremely short-term
treasury bills.
	   In a sign of confidence, the Central Bank lowered two key
interest rates late Thursday after hiking them to an unprecedented
150 percent last week.
	   ``We have stopped the crisis and reached a turning point,''
Russian premier Sergei Kiriyenko said Friday at a conference in
Ukraine, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   All the same, the new rates of 60 percent are still double what
they were before the crisis intensified two weeks ago.
	   Stocks were steady in early trading Friday after regaining some
ground earlier in the week. Traders said the market appeared to be
waiting for Tuesday when Russia's financial woes will top the
agenda at a meeting of G-8 finance officials.
	   All together, Russia's stock market is down about 50 percent
since the beginning of the year.
	   Russia's tax collection troubles are at the heart of the crisis.
The country's new tax chief has said that fewer than 3 percent of
Russian citizens filed income tax declarations last year.
	   ``The time has come to demand and punish, including filing
criminal charges,'' Yeltsin said ominously. ``If we don't collect
taxes, we can't pay salaries.''
	   The tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, has announced plans to crack down
on Russia's 1,000 richest citizens.
	   ``Well-known people should be examples for other citizens,''
Fyodorov told the Kommersant daily in an interview published
Friday.
	   The government's chronic inability to pay wages to state workers
has led to labor protests, including strikes by coal miners last
month that shut down parts of the country's rail system.

Chinese arrest Catholic priest, detain followers, group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police arrested a Catholic priest, beat
him and then detained more than 40 worshipers after they tried to
help him, a rights advocacy group reported Friday.
	   Police arrested the Rev. Lin Rengui after he finished
celebrating Christmas midnight Mass on Dec. 25 in southeastern
Fujian province's coastal Pingtan county, Washington-based Freedom
House reported, citing unidentified Christian sources.
	   The group gave the following account of the aftermath of his
arrest:
	   Members of the congregation went to the police station the
following day and demanded to see the priest. When police refused,
the worshipers pushed by the guards and found the priest beaten and
unconscious on the floor. The next day police arrested more than 40
Catholics in Pingtan.
	   An official charged with monitoring religion in Pingtan partly
confirmed the incident, but denied many of the details.
	   Freedom House said the priest and the other Catholics were
detained because they openly declared allegiance to the pope. China
bans religious services outside the government-controlled Catholic
church, which does not recognize the Vatican's authority.
	   The group said the whereabouts and well-being of the priest and
the detained Catholics remain unknown.
	   Qiu Jiusheng, vice director of Pingtan's Religious Affairs
Bureau, said a minister and 30 to 50 of his followers had been
arrested in December for being part of ``an underground religious
group.''
	   The group was arrested on Pingtan's Yutou island, which the
official described as a hotbed of illegal religious activity.
	   The official said the minister was not from Pingtan. His
followers were released soon after their detention and the minister
was let go after a dozen or so days, the official said.

Witnesses, paparazzi, Al Fayed converge on Paris courthouse
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of hearing; quotes.

  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A simple, tragic car accident, caused by a drunk
driver. Is that the whole answer?
	   That's what Judge Herve Stephan was trying to find out Friday as
he gathered the key parties in the Diana case for a closed-door
hearing.
	   Grouped together for the first time were the photographers under
investigation in the case; eight witnesses to the crash; Mohamed Al
Fayed; and, according to defense lawyers in the room, Diana's
mother, Frances Shand Kydd. They were accompanied by a platoon of
lawyers.
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But what was the responsibility of the paparazzi trailing
Diana's Mercedes that night? Nine photographers and one press
motorcyclist have been placed under investigation _ a step short of
being formally charged. They have remained in legal limbo for
almost a year, continuing their work.
	   In what was seen as a last-ditch effort to clarify their roles,
Stephan was examining each photographer one by one Friday.
	   Lawyers emerging from the courtroom described the process. Two
hours into the hearing, the judge had already dealt with two
photographers: Romuald Rat and Stephane Darmon. Each gave an
account of their activities that night. The judge then questioned
them, questioned witnesses as to what they had seen, then opened
questions to other lawyers.
	   Stepping outside for a break, Al Fayed, Dodi's father, would say
only: ``It's going fine. Great judge.''
	   He is a civil party in the case, meaning he has access to
documents and proceedings. Diana's mother was also there but said
nothing, said lawyer Virginie Bardet.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   ``It's very well organized. It's calm, thorough, and clear. I am
persuaded it will serve a purpose,'' said lawyer Jean-Louis
Pelletier, who represents photographers David Ker and Fabrice
Chassery.
	   The policemen said during the hearing that Rat had hindered
their work, lawyers said on condition of anonymity.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many close to the case believe they will soon be exonerated, at
least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but that he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,'' said
Arsov. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have to do their
job.''
	   Arsov was supposed to be shooting pictures Friday at the French
Open tennis tournament.
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the grounds of the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily
guarded by police.
	   Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a Mercedes,
surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   His spokesman, Lawrie Meyer, said ``This is a process to decide
if the paparazzi should go to trial.''
	   Mr. Al Fayed ``is still a grieving parent and is here to find
out what happened to his son,'' he said.
	   In a statement issued in London on Thursday, Al Fayed said he
was ``determined to get to the truth'' about whether the crash was
an accident or a plot to kill Diana and his son.
	   But French judicial sources said recently Al Fayed has backed
off his contention that the crash stemmed from a plot, and now
blames the paparazzi.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   Investigators also recently conducted road tests on a race track
near Paris to reconstruct the crash. Police revealed no details of
those tests.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

EU increases capital of investment bank to 100 billion ECU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers agreed
unanimously Friday to increase the capital of the European
Investment Bank to 100 billion European Currency Units (dlrs 111
billion) to help it cope with challenges posed by EU's single
currency and expansion into Eastern Europe.
	   The increase in capital from 62 billion ECU (dlrs 68.8 billion)
will take effect from Jan. 1. It raises the statutory ceiling on
EIB lending to 250 billion ECU (dlrs 277.5 billion).
	   ``The capital increase will allow us to continue to finance
long-term investment in priority areas,'' said EIB President Brian
Unwin.
	   ``This is all the more necessary if the Union is to meet

World Cup: tight security greets U.S. soccer team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ The U.S. soccer team arrived at the World
Cup Friday to an atmosphere in stark contrast to four years ago,
when the Americans were host of the tournament.
	   After an overnight flight from New York to Paris, the Americans
took a specially chartered plane to avoid the Air France pilots'
strike and arrived at Lyon's Satolas Airport shortly before noon.
	   There were as many soldiers and police toting machine guns and
pistols as there were soccer players. Officials allowed French
people to greet the team inside the terminal, but left outside the
three dozen Americans who came for its arrival.
	   ``How `bout the American kids?'' yelled Bob Kennedy of
Greenwich, Conn., head of the American club of Lyon.
	   Hours earlier, fans had no such problems getting autographs as
the team mingled with other passengers amidst virtually no security
as they waited to board their flight at JFK Airport in New York.
	   But in Lyon, players were surrounded by police on motorcycles,
and in cars and vans. A bomb-sniffing dog went through the bus
before the players boarded.
	   ``We're happy to be here,'' coach Steve Sampson said.
	   The team looked tired after a flight that included the movie
``Grease.'' The team flew coach _ ``There was no room'' in first
class, said Sampson.
	   ``My eyes are red,'' midfielder Joe-Max Moore said.
	   The players later reached across the barricade to sign
autographs for the American kids.
	   ``All right, yeah, cool,'' defender Alexi Lalas said.
	   To beat the top teams, such as Germany and Yugoslavia, who along
with Iran are in the American's first-round group, the United
States will have to improve on its scoring. The team has 14 goals
in 12 games this year, posting a 6-3-3 record primarily on the
strength of its defense and goalkeeping from Kasey Keller, who has
four consecutive shutouts.
	   ``I'd be much more concerned if we weren't creating
opportunities,'' Sampson said. ``I think the goals will come.''
	   But Sampson said Thursday that midfielders Claudio Reyna,
Frankie Hejduk and Brian Maisonneuve have all healed after missing
last weekend's warmup match against Scotland.
	   The only remaining injury question is forward Eric Wynalda, the
leading career goal scorer for the U.S. team, who is battling back
from knee surgery, but should be healthy for the opener against
Germany.
	   After Monday's opening match in Paris, the Americans will take
on Iran (June 21 in Lyon) and close out the opening round against
Yugoslavia (June 25 in Nantes).
	   ``Four years ago we hoped we'd do well, this time we expect
it,'' said midfielder Tab Ramos, playing in his third World Cup.
``But we have two of the best teams in the world in our group. For
us to advance, we will have to upset a very good team.''

EU increases capital of investment bank to 100 billion ECU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers agreed
unanimously Friday to increase the capital of the European
Investment Bank to 100 billion European Currency Units (dlrs 111
billion) to help it cope with challenges posed by EU's single
currency and expansion into Eastern Europe.
	   The increase in capital from 62 billion ECU (dlrs 68.8 billion)
will take effect from Jan. 1. It raises the statutory ceiling on
EIB lending to 250 billion ECU (dlrs 277.5 billion).
	   ``The capital increase will allow us to continue to finance
long-term investment in priority areas,'' said EIB President Brian
Unwin. ``This is all the more necessary if the Union is to meet
successfully the enormous challenges it faces in establishing
economic and monetary union and preparing for enlargement.''
	   Unwin presented the annual report of the EU's lending arm, which
showed EIB lending increased by 13 percent in 1997 to 26.2 billion
ECU (dlrs 29 billion). Of that, 23 billion ECU (dlrs 25.5 billion)
was in the 15 EU member nations.
	   In its annual meeting, the bank's board _ made up of finance
ministers from the 15 EU nations _ agreed the bank will use the

nations adopt it as their shared currency.
	   Of the 3.244 billion ECU (dlrs 3.6 billion) loaned to non-EU
nations, about half went to the Cyprus and the 10 Eastern European
nations who opened membership negotiations with the Union in March.
	   The bank was set up in 1958 to raise funds on capital markets
and fund investments in areas such as development of poorer
regions, trans-European transport, telecoms and energy networks,
and environmental protection.

Air France strike into fifth day as labor unrest spreads

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup looming, Air France officials
and pilots worked to end a strike that is already disrupting the
run up to the soccer championships that starts next week.
	   Railway conductors demanding higher pay called a work stoppage
until Saturday morning, forcing reduced service on numerous lines.
	   That was but the latest in a series of strikes fouling the run
up to the World Cup. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected
for the soccer championship, along with summer tourists.
	   The third round of talks between Air France and pilots' unions
at the company's Paris headquarters ended at 4:30 a.m. (0230 GMT)
after nearly 10 hours. There were no signs of an immediate
breakthrough as the strike entered its fifth day Friday.
	   A new round of talks was set for 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) Friday.
	   Negotiators will ``start nearly at zero,'' said Christian Paris,
spokesman for the main pilots' union, the SNPL, referring to what
he said was a ``very clear toughening'' of Air France's position.
	   The pilots are prepared to strike for at least 15 days,
coinciding with the start of the June 10-July 12 soccer
championship.
	   Despite the strike, Air France, the World Cup's official
carrier, has guaranteed transport for the 32 teams taking part.
	   But the strike has already caused problems for some teams.
	   Many French players could not get back to their training base on
time Monday after a three-day holiday weekend. The U.S. team, which
arrived Friday, took a special charter to avoid the strike.
	   Ordinary travelers were outraged.
	   ``These strikes are deplorable ... To do this at World Cup time,
holding the public hostage, it's terrible,'' said Roger Hoarau, 82,
who was trying to fly home to La Reunion, the Indian Ocean island.
	   With just six days until the World Cup begins, France is plagued
by labor disputes.
	   Railway conductors went on strike Thursday evening and planned
to continue their action until 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) Saturday. The
state-run SNCF train authority expected reduced service.
	   Paris subway drivers and railway workers in southern France
staged minor strikes Thursday, heaping on further misery.
	   Baggage handlers went on strike this week at Charles de Gaulle
airport in Paris, and airline mechanics threatened to.
	   The transport woes infuriated French officials who feared for
the country's image.
	   Michel Charasse, a Socialist senator, accused the pilots of
being ``egotistical, and not loving their country.''
	   Leading conservative lawmaker Philippe Seguin said the strike
risked making France ``the laughing stock of the entire world.''
	   The highly paid pilots are protesting planned salary cuts. The
company wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) in pay cuts.
	   The strike posed a big test for the Socialist-government of
Lionel Jospin.
	   The company said it planned 17 percent of its long-distance
flights Friday, 30 percent of its short and medium-distance routes
from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 40 percent from Orly.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections after investigators pointed to a wheel
failure as a possible cause of the country's worst rail accident in
more than 50 years.
	   The confirmed death toll rose to 96 at midday Friday after
rescue crews found a body beneath a 10-meter-long section of a
collapsed bridge.
	   ``We have to fear that we will find more bodies under here as we
go along,'' said Eschede police spokesman Joachim Haack. In
addition to the train passengers, rescue workers are also looking
for two maintenance men who were working on an adjoining track at
the time of the crash.
	   Two other bodies were recovered earlier in the day from the last
major part of wreckage to be excavated, a dining car that was
buried when an overpass collapsed during Wednesday's pileup.
	   ``It would appear that the restaurant car was closed for some
reason, otherwise there would have been more people in it,'' Haack
said earlier.
	   Before the latest discovery, police had said they hoped they had
located all the victims. Ninety-three bodies have been recovered at
the scene, and three people died in hospitals.

Federico Garcia Lorca: small-town poet with worldwide following
</HEADLINE>
  By MAR ROMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   FUENTEVAQUEROS, Spain (AP) _ Federico Garcia Lorca is the most
translated Spanish poet ever, but the people in the white-painted
village where he was born 100 years ago on Friday just call him
Federico.
	   ``Federico is like one of the family,'' said Celia Ramos, who
has a portrait of Garcia Lorca hanging in her living room.
	   The village ``family'' prepared to host a battery of Spanish
artists and political figures for the nighttime celebrations Friday
that were expected to attract up to 20,000 people, and surviving
friends and relatives were invited to an intimate gathering in the
house were Garcia Lorca grew up.
	   While Spaniards and intellectuals around the world analyze his
lyrical creations, the villagers claim a personal link with the
legendary poet who was killed in 1936 by Gen. Francisco Franco's
Nationalist troops during the opening days of the Spanish Civil
War.
	   ``Federico was an excellent and very open person with a very
good sense of humor, although he was also a clumsy and rather
fearful child,'' recalled Ramos, 58, repeating the words of her
aunt and his nanny, Carmen Ramos.
	   Like the majority of the 4,000 habitants of Fuentevaqueros,
Ramos can recite some of Garcia Lorca's poems by heart, although
she has read little of his work.
	   ``Because of Franco we didn't know about the great talent of
Federico,'' said Amparo Garcia, 82, a distant relative of the poet,
``the foreigners who came to the town knew more about of him than
we did''.
	   Relegated to the cultural shadows during Franco's 40-year
regime, the first anniversary celebration in Fuentevaqueros did not
take place until 1976, a year after the dictator died.
	   Residents recall how police watched from rooftops as the crowd
clapped and wept when one of the poet's nephews shouted, ``Federico
lives! He is still with us.''
	   Two decades on, the Spanish cultural mainstream no longer fears
the poet's compassion for the poor, and 1998 has been designated
``Lorca year.''
	   Publishing houses have printed new biographies and reprinted the
old, including the seminal work ``Federico Garcia Lorca: A Life,''
written by Irish writer-historian Ian Gibson. Gibson was so
attracted by his study of the poet's life that he adopted Spanish
citizenship and moved to the nearby city of Granada, where he lives
today.
	   Lorca, as he is more commonly referred to in English (dropping
his first surname), abandoned his law studies to immerse himself in
literature, painting and music.
	   By his early 20s he was rubbing shoulders with the artistic
vanguard of his generation, and was friends with surrealist painter
Salvador Dali, filmmaker Luis Bunuel and poet Rafael Alberti.
	   International fame, but not happiness, came in 1928 with the
publication of ``Romancero Gitano'' (``Gypsie Ballads'').
	   The poet fled to the United States and Cuba in 1929-30, and
wrote ``Poeta en Nueva York'' (Poet in New York), published
posthumously in 1940.
	   The Lorca centennial has also filled Spanish theaters with
productions of his famous dramatic trilogy that began in 1933 with
``Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding) and was followed by ``Yerma'' in
1934 _ that focuses on the social stigma suffered by a sterile
woman.
	   Two years later, Lorca rounded off the trio with a tragic tale
of repressed sexuality in a house dominated by a strong-willed
mother in ``La Casa de Bernarda Alba'' (The House of Bernarda
Alba).
	   Love and lust, death, motherhood and above all, cruelty and
violence are running themes throughout his work.
	   Lorca's own homosexuality, outcried by the Franco's fascist
regime, is still controversial today among the villagers.
	   ``I don't believe it, although my aunt said she found him quite
effeminate'' said Ramos.
	   Lorca returned frequently to Fuentevaqueros, an inspiration and
solitary refuge surrounded by tobacco fields and orchards in the
fertile Granada plain in Andalusia.
	   About eight million people have visited his former house since
it was turned into a museum in 1986 _ the pilgrims ranging from
British/Indian writer Salman Rusdhie, American singer Leonard Cohen
to former Portuguese premier Mario Soares.
	   Celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, 38
years from now, will be less easy to organize than this year's
centennial. The exact date and place of his murder are still a
mystery.
	   ``The fascists killed him because they were jealous of him, he
didn't deserve to be killed, he was not politically minded and he
helped everyone in need,'' Ramos said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake that hit a remote part of the
Xinjiang region in northwest China on May 29 injured 28 people,
killed 5,000 head of livestock and caused heavy damage, an official
report said Friday.
	   The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 and was the strongest on
record in remote Pishan and Moyu counties, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   More than 2,000 buildings toppled and 3,000 others were heavily
damaged, the report said.
	   Local government and Communist Party leaders organized efforts
to rescue and house the homeless in tents, the report said.
	   It is not unusual for China's state media to wait days before
reporting damage from natural disasters.

Rabbi says transsexual diva can be counted as a man in worship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ She's man enough for them.
	   The head of a rabbinical court says Dana International, Israel's
celebrated transsexual singer, could be counted in a minyan, the
group of 10 men required for Jewish prayer services.
	   Whoever is born male remains so his entire life, the Maariv
daily quoted Rabbi Eliyahu Abergal as saying during a lecture in a
Jerusalem synagogue about how Jewish law applies to transsexuals.
	   However, the sultry winner of this year's Eurovision contest
would have to become religiously observant before qualifying for
prayer group, the rabbi said.
	   Dana International, who had a sex change operation five years
ago, has become a symbol for the increasingly bitter rift between
Israel's secular majority and its ultra-religious minority.
	   The country's Orthodox establishment has denounced her as an
abomination while secular Israelis embraced her in a sign of
increasing mainstream acceptance of the country's gay community.

Blues level Origin series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ New South Wales turned on a classy
attacking display to level the State of Origin rugby league series
against Queensland with a 26-10 victory at Suncorp Stadium on
Friday.
	   With test captain Laurie Daley, lock Brad Fittler and scrum half
Andrew Johns all in imposing form, and prop Rodney Howe making
destructive runs, the Blues ran in five tries to Queensland's two.
	   ``It's always difficult to win up here but we're a pretty
determined bunch and we were embarrassed by losing the first
game,'' said Daley.
	   As in the first game, which Queensland sneaked 24-23 with a
last-minute try, the Maroons started impressively in Origin II with
Allan Langer kicking them ahead. Langer chipped a cross field kick
over Adam MacDougall for a Wendell Sailor try in the corner in the
third minute. Darren Lockyer converted from the sideline but the
Blues responded quickly.
	   MacDougall scored the Blues first try on nine minutes when he
finished off some good support play after Queensland failed to
clean up a kick from Johns.
	   Johns missed the conversion and failed again after center Paul
McGregor crossed in the 16th minute.
	   McGregor's second strong thrust for the goal line produced a
21st minute try while lock Brad Fittler put on a fourth try with a
dazzling dummy and sidestep to give the visitors a 20-6 half-time
lead.
	   Queensland came from 13-6 down at the break in Origin I but was
unable to make a similar comeback.
	   The Blues pushed further ahead three minutes into the second
half when Queensland winger Matt Sing fumbled a high kick from
Fittler and Tim Brasher picked up the loose ball for the try.
Johns' third goal put the Blues out to an unbeatable 26-6 lead.
	   Sing closed the gap with a try on 60 minutes after a weaving run
to raise the Maroons hopes, and while the home side finished the
game the stronger, it was unable to break a superb Blues defensive
line.

Indonesian government relaxes restrictions on media
</HEADLINE>
  With Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Relaxing longtime curbs on the press,
the government on Friday recognized an independent journalists'
union and revoked its right to ban publications by decree.
	   The moves fall in line with President B.J. Habibie's pledge to
implement democratic reform following the ouster May 21 of his
autocratic predecessor, Suharto, amid political and economic
turmoil.
	   During three decades in power, Suharto often muzzled and banned
media organizations for reports that he said threatened national
stability. In his final weeks as president, newspapers grew more
critical of the government, openly demanding new leadership.
	   The information ministry agreed to recognize the Independent
Journalists' Alliance, a group that rivaled a government-backed
association, spokesman Naina Akmadsyah said.
	   Previously, all journalists were required to register with the
government union in order to work.
	   Akmadsyah also said the ministry could only close down a
publication with legal action, instead of government decree. In
1994, Suharto shut down Tempo, Indonesia's most respected magazine,
after it published critical articles that angered Habibie, then a
Cabinet minister.
	   The government will grant publishing licenses to editors who
want to restart Tempo as well as two other banned magazines, Detik
and Editor, Akmadsyah said.

Mir, shuttle crews unload supplies
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNA DOLGOV  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cosmonauts and astronauts packed up space shuttle
Discovery Friday for its final trip home from Russia's Mir space
station.
	   Space officials said the two crews were happy to see each other
but saddened by their impending departure on Monday.
	   Cosmonauts and astronauts cheered when the U.S. space shuttle
Discovery docked with the Mir on Thursday to ferry home the last
American to live on the Russian orbiter, astronaut Andrew Thomas.
	   The Mir itself is also nearing its last year in service, as
Russian space officials plan to abandon the station in the end of
1999 and later let it burn in the atmosphere.
	   ``It's too bad that the Mir is almost finished,'' said Russian
Mission Control spokeswoman Vera Medvedkova. ``We will work with
Americans again, at the international space station, but we're
sorry about the Mir.''
	   ``Although this is a mixed feeling,'' she added. ``The Mir has
been flying for quite a time _ 12 years.''
	   Thomas has already settled in for his ride back home, sleeping
aboard the shuttle Thursday night.
	   On Friday, the two crews were transferring the shuttle's cargo
of water and food to Mir, and moving U.S. scientific equipment from
Mir to Discovery.
	   The cosmonauts and astronauts will also work on several
scientific experiments before the shuttle leaves, and the Russians
will continue doing research under a NASA program some time into
the fall.
	   The Discovery's arrival brought the number of visitors to the
Russian space station to more than 100, according to Mission
Control.
	   But it was unlikely that any one person would claim the
distinction of being the 100th visitor since Discovery's six-member
crew included four first-timers.
	   Among them is the Russian co-director of the Mir-shuttle program
and a designer of the Mir station, Valery Ryumin.
	   Ryumin has made three space flights in the past, the last of
them 18 years ago, but had never before been to the Mir.
	   ``I think I have a right to see what happened to something that
I spent all my life developing,'' the 58-year-old Ryumin has said.
	   ``Ryumin has worked well on the Russian-U.S. manned flight
program, and this mission is a sort of a reward,'' Ryumin's boss,
president of the Energiya company Yuri Semyonov, was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency as saying.
	   The Mir has been running smoothly in the past few months. Last
year, the Mir suffered a fire, chemical leaks in its cooling system
and a rupture from a collision with a cargo ship.

Activists: Iraq to evict 120 Kurdish families from north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq plans to evict a new group of 120
Kurdish families from the northern city of Kirkuk starting June 15,
the Iraqi Communist Party said Friday.
	   Provincial police in Kirkuk ordered the evictions after a
government committee on May 28 said that deportees were ``relatives
of saboteurs and elements who joined the hostile bands,'' the party
said in a statement.
	   ``The impending wave of mass deportation is further evidence
(of) the ethnic cleansing campaign pursued by the dictatorial
regime,'' said the statement, faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo.
	   The families were informed of the orders ``in the last couple of
days,'' Kawa Rashid, a spokesman for the Party told The Associated
Press by telephone from Britain. He said the group had lists of the
families to be deported.
	   The Iraqi government admitted in January that it had expelled a
number of Kurdish families from Kirkuk, but said the action was
legal as they had violated transfer laws in moving to Kirkuk.
	   Iraqi opposition groups and Kurds say the forced resettlement is
part of a government campaign to ``Arabize'' Kirkuk, a center or
the oil industry.
	   The city lies 240 kilometers (145 miles) north of the capital,
Baghdad, in the government-controlled sector of northern Iraq. It
has a Kurdish majority.
	   An earlier report by the Iraqi Communist Party said authorities
had already expelled 114 Kurdish families from Kirkuk and another
1,468 families have been told they eventually will be evicted.

World Cup: English F.A. switches and backs Blatter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Football Association, after early
support for Lennart Johansson for the FIFA presidency, came out
Friday behind his rival Sepp Blatter.
	   On Monday, the FIFA Congress meeting in Paris will vote on a new
president to succeed Brazilian Joao Havelange.
	   ``After careful deliberation... England will cast its vote in
favor of Sepp Blatter,'' the F.A. said in a brief statement.
	   The English F.A. had initially backed Johansson, president of
Europe's governing body of soccer UEFA, when he was the lone
candidate. Blatter, the FIFA general secretary, declared his
candidacy only a few months ago.
	   Neither candidate has backed England's bid to land the 2006
World Cup.
	   Blatter, now favored to win Monday's vote, said earlier this
week he wants Africa to host the 2006 World Cup. Johansson has
favored Germany over England to be the European bidder for 2006.
	   As recently as January, F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly
supported Johannson.
	   ``Lennart Johansson has always been a friend to England and at
this stage we are maintaining our support for him,'' Johannson said
in Ghent, Belgium.

Japan's Parliament approves ``Big Bang'' deregulation bills
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS more comments from finance minister, other details,
byline  
  By KOZO MIZOGUCHI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament approved four financial
deregulation bills Friday, accelerating the country's ``Big Bang''
program of opening financial markets to greater competition.
	   The measures are designed to make Japanese financial
institutions more efficient, globally competitive and on par with
those in New York and London by 2001. The reforms also will offer
foreign financial companies wider access to the Japanese market.
	   Friday's action by the upper house followed similar approval of
the bills in the more powerful lower house last month.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told a news conference that
the reform legislation will help create a ``favorable environment''
for Japan's economy by revitalizing slumping Tokyo markets and
benefiting consumers as well.
	   ``It will become even more important for firms and individuals
to make their own investment judgments, based on full recognition
of risks and characteristics of each product and service,''
Matsunaga said in a separate statement.
	   The Big Bang reforms, nicknamed after similar British financial
reforms in the 1980s, come at a tough time for Japan's weakening
economy.
	   Stock prices remain far below record highs, and banks and other
financial institutions are saddled with massive bad debts left over
from a 1980s speculative land price boom that went bust.
Unemployment and corporate bankruptcies are at record highs.
	   One key reform bill approved Friday is the liberalization of
non-life insurance premium rates that will take place July 1.
	   The United States and Japan agreed in 1996 on steps to open
Japan's dlrs 341 billion insurance market to greater competition to
U.S. and other foreign companies.
	   Japan's insurance market has been tightly regulated. Premiums
rates are set by industry panels, ruling out price competition, and
the types of policies that can be offered are also very limited.
	   Among other measures approved by the 252-member House of
Councilors:
	   _ Banks can sell investment trust funds from their own windows
from Dec. 1.
	   _ A ban on trading derivatives will be lifted Dec. 1.
	   _ Brokers' commission fees will be completely liberalized by the
end of 1999, while further liberalizing sales of mutual funds and
securities.
	   _ Greater disclosure of corporate management information.
	   _ A registration system will be introduced for securities firms.
	   Matsunaga also said an independent Finance Supervisory Agency
will be set up June 22, a move that will wrest supervision of
financial institutions from the scandal-plagued Finance Ministry.
	   The powerful ministry has been under intense pressure to give up
supervisory functions, but it has only recently agreed to do so in
the wake of a series of scandals involving cozy ties between the
ministry and finance institutions.
	   As part of the sweeping financial deregulation program, Japan
put a revised foreign exchange law into effect on April 1, allowing
Japanese individuals and businesses for the first time to handle
foreign currencies freely.

EU to boost Kosovo aid to cope with refugee exodus
</HEADLINE>

  By ANNA SATHIAH  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Friday it will
increase its dlrs 2.2 million aid package for Kosovo to help
Albania cope with an influx of refugees from the Serbian province.
	   ``We'll have to increase the (Kosovo aid) budget. It could even
be doubled,'' EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said.
	   Additionally, the EU foreign ministers are to approve spending
of dlrs 990,000 enabling ex-Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez
to act as EU envoy to the Western Balkans.
	   At a meeting in Luxembourg Monday, the ministers are expected to
proceed with this though Belgrade has said it will bar Gonzalez if
he meddles in internal affairs, such as Kosovo.
	   Also, the EU may ban investments in Serbia. Until now, it has
shied away from that, together with the United States, to encourage
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic from reaching a negotiated
settlement for Kosovo _ a strategy that has not worked.
	   The EU and the United States have frozen Yugoslav assets abroad,
banned arms sales and export credits to Yugoslavia and limited
travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country holds the EU
presidency, said Friday the Europeans were mulling how to stop the
fighting in Kosovo. ``We are looking very carefully at how we can
send a strong message ... that we regard this as an extremely
important strategic interest,'' he said after a meeting with Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok in The Hague.
	   The EU currently channels its aid for Kosovo through three
humanitarian agencies in northern Albania: Britain's Oxfam and
Children Aid Direct, and the Belgian branch of Doctors without
Borders.
	   The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated Thursday there
are some 10,000 refugees in Albania.
	   A further 20,000 people are in Kosovo near the border with
Albania and ``could pour into Albania at any moment,'' said
Petrucci. In Kosovo, the UNHCR is assisting 44,627 people who have
fled their homes because of the Serb campaign to crush militants in
the breakaway province, he said.

Botha lawyers blame state killings on ``bad apples''
</HEADLINE>
  AP Photos GEO101-102

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ An angry Desmond Tutu on Friday
objected to the suggestion that apartheid-era killings of black
activists were the work of ``bad apples'' _ or rogues _ in the
State Security forces.
	   ``How many `bad apples' are you going to concede?'' the Nobel
Laureate minister asked during cross examination by defense lawyers
for former President P.W. Botha. ``No, no. We cannot now say that
these are `bad apples.' They are people who were sitting on the
State Security Council.''
	   Botha is on trial for snubbing the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which is probing atrocities committed during white
rule. But the case has focused on allegations that Botha and the
shadowy State Security Council he headed coordinated a crackdown on
anti-apartheid activists and directly ordered bombings and killings
during the 1980s.
	   Grilling Tutu, who heads the Truth Commission, defense lawyer
Lappe Laubscher said there were no direct assassination orders in
any of the Council's minutes, indicating the killings were the work
of ``bad apples'' in the police and army who misunderstood orders.
	   Prosecution witnesses, including police death squad commander
Eugene de Kock, testified earlier this week that the council's use
of phrases like ``eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' sanctioned the
murder of the white-run state's opponents.
	   Botha and other top members of the SSC claim they only meant
people should be arrested.
	   Botha has been implicated by a former national police
commissioner who in earlier Truth Commission hearings alleged that
he ordered the 1988 bombing of the Johannesburg headquarters of an
anti-apartheid group.
	   Since his trial began Monday, Botha sat impassively throughout
the exchange, occasionally looking behind him at members of his
legal team and family.
	   Botha, 82, ignored three subpoenas to testify before the
commission on the role of the SSC, which Botha chaired during 11
years as head of state. Due to his age and frail health the trial
is being held in the southern coastal city of George, near Botha's
retirement home.
	   The former hard-liner has called the Truth Commission ``a
circus,'' claiming it is victimizing him by wanting him to appear
in person when he has submitted more than 1,700 pages of written
answers to commission questions.
	   If convicted, Botha likely faces a hefty fine.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the ANC, which had been waging a guerrilla
campaign against apartheid.
	   The talks culminated in all-race elections in 1994, which the
ANC won.

Lebed inaugurated as governor of Siberian region

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was
sworn in Friday as governor of a huge region in central Siberia _ a
post seen by many as a springboard to the presidency.
	   During the solemn inauguration ceremony, Lebed took an oath on
the Bible and was blessed by Bishop Antoniy, leader of the Russian
Orthodox Church in the Krasnoyarsk region.
	   He dressed in a tuxedo for the occasion _ a significant choice
of clothes in a country where tuxedos were once deemed unacceptably
``bourgeois.''
	   Lebed, a gravel-voiced former paratroop general, ran for
president in 1996 and has long said he plans to run again. However,
he played down those ambitions during the gubernatorial race,
saying he would only run for president in 2000 if he succeeds in
improving the economy in Krasnoyarsk.
	   Speaking to reporters after his inauguration, he criticized
Moscow for keeping the lion's share of the country's money, but
said he hoped to reach agreement with the federal government over
funding rather than provoke a confrontation.
	   ``All the blood is in the head. I fear the country may suffer a
heart attack,'' he said, in one of his typically homespun
aphorisms.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian business mogul who
supported Lebed's run for governor, attended his inauguration and
hailed him as a ``serious Russian politician.''
	   However Berezovsky, now serving in government as executive
secretary of the alliance former Soviet republics, quickly added
that Lebed would be a ``big problem for the nation'' if elected
Russian president.
	   Berezovsky has previously said that he helped Lebed's election
in Krasnoyarsk so he would get bogged down in the region's problems
and be less able to run for president in 2000.
	   Lebed has denied he received any financial assistance from
Berezovsky.
	   Lebed finished a strong third in Russia's last presidential
election in 1996. Later that year he received nationwide acclaim
for his role in negotiating the end to the deeply unpopular war in
secessionist Chechnya.

Taiwan invents device to test couple's compatability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese company has come up with a
``Love Magician'' machine that promises to electronically determine
if a couple are truly meant for each other, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The gadget is a pocket size electronic device that compares a
couple's vital statistics and then announces whether they are a
suitable match, the China Times reported.
	   Couples eager to know if their relationships are heading toward
marital bliss _ or a dead end _ punch in their heights, weights,
blood types, birthdays, astrological signs, hobbies, and favorite
foods and colors.
	   If the two are compatible, the screen will flash ``successful
connection,'' and a doll face will appear, the width of whose smile
indicates the degree of compatibility, the paper said.
	   For the superstitious, the device comes installed with
electronic tarot cards, dice and other fortune-telling devices, the
paper said.
	   The report, which did not name the manufacturer, said the device
has not gone on the market yet. The report also did not name a
price.

German diplomat urges quick international aid for Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
  By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania is incapable of handling the
waves of refugees fleeing the Serbian offensive in nieghboring
Kosovo province and only immediate international aid can halt a
potential humanitarian crisis, a German diplomat warned Friday.
	   Wolfgang Ischinger, a regional political director for the German
Foreign Ministry, acknowledged that diplomatic efforts to end the
unrest have collapsed in the latest Serbian ``expulsions and
military operations.''
	   ``They must be stopped,'' he told a news conference.
	   ``Serbia has undertaken an ethnic cleansing. There is not a
different name to call it, and that is unsupportable,'' he added,
using a phrase for forced expulsions that is widely associated with
the battles for territory in the former Yugoslavia.
	   The United Nations refugee agency says 40,000 people in Kosovo
have fled their homes following the campaign by Serb forces to
crush separatist rebels in the southern province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since the Serbs stepped up
their drive in March to destroy the militant Kosovo Liberation
Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of Kosovo.
	   About 12,000 refugees have crossed into an impoverished and
remote corner of northeastern Albania, officials in the region
estimate. The number is expected to rise as the offensive in Kosovo
continues.
	   Ischinger urged the United Nations and other international
groups to mobilize humanitarian aid and increase pressure to halt
the fighting.
	   ``My impression is that the Albanian government cannot face by
itself the new situation,'' he said. ``Our intention is opening the
way to those refugees back to their home. If they will be pushed
thousands of kilometers away from their homeland, the return back
will be difficult.''

PAL pilots strike over early retirement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Pilots at Philippine Airlines went on
strike Friday over an alleged violation of job security and bad
faith in mediation talks, forcing the cancellation of domestic and
international flights.
	   Florendo Umali, spokesman of the 620-strong Airline Pilots
Association of the Philippines, said the union is protesting a new
management policy of retiring pilots who have reached 20 years of
service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   This policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of being
``retired,'' he said.
	   PAL called the strike illegal because the Department of Labor
has assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute.
	   ``Those who participate will be deemed to have abandoned their
employment status,'' PAL Executive Vice President Manolo E. Aquino
said.
	   He said PAL was attempting to shift affected passengers to other
airlines and asking pilots not supporting the strike to report for
work.
	   The labor department has called for a meeting between the two
sides Saturday morning, he said.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced plans
earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent, slash
flights, and sharply reduce its work force. The airline hasn't
disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but employees
fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   The union filed a notice of strike in December following the
company's early retirement of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a senior
pilot. But it said it delayed the strike after considering its
impact on the company.
	   In calling the strike Friday, the union accused management of
filing administrative charges against another pilot and union
officer who delayed a flight by returning to the gate for
refueling, and of delays in turning over union dues.
	   The refueling delay will be investigated under proper
procedures, Aquino said.
	   The union said the actions occurred despite an order from the
Department of Labor inhibiting both parties from exacerbating the
situation.
	   ``We do not want to disrupt the operations of PAL and the
routine of our lives,'' the union said. ``But there is a limit to
the harassment and insincerity we can take.''
	   PAL is controlled by Chinese Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan. It was
semi-privatized in 1992 after being completely owned by the
Philippine government since 1941.

Norwegian company buys biggest Romanian machine maker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Norway's Kvaerner acquired a 90
percent share of IMGB, the biggest Romanian manufacturer of heavy
machines and turbines, an official said Friday.
	   Kvaerner paid only dlrs 500,000 for its stake in IMGB, but
agreed to invest dlrs 65 million to modernize the company and pay
its dlrs 35 million debts, Mircea Tudor, an IMGB director, said by
telephone.
	   ``There is the most significant privatization document signed
until now by the Romanian state,'' Privatization Minister Sorin
Dimitriu said.
	   Kvaerner employs more than 55,000 in 100 countries, and is
involved in areas such as engineering, construction, shipbuilding
and real estate.
	   In the first quarter of the year, it reported pre-tax profits of
dlrs 30.2 million.
	   IMGB has 2,600 employees and capital stock of nearly dlrs 21
million.
	   Its machinery is sold both domestically and in other former
communist countries.
	   Economic analysts predict more foreign investors will come to
Romania if the government offers similar firms with high debts for
privatization.
	   ``In this case, the share price does not matter, but the
company's future,'' said Carmen Rudnitchi, economic analyst of the
financial weekly, Capital.
	   Kvaerner also bought a 51 percent stake this week in FENCE,
which produces equipment for nuclear power plants. Terms of the
deal were not disclosed.

EU to boost Kosovo aid to cope with refugee exodus
</HEADLINE>
  With Yugoslavia-Kosovo; Albania-Kosovo; Blair-Kosovo  
  By ANNA SATHIAH  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union said Friday it will
increase its dlrs 2.2 million aid package for Kosovo to help
Albania cope with an influx of refugees from the neighboring
Serbian province.
	   ``We'll have to increase the (Kosovo aid) budget. It could even
be doubled,'' EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said.
	   Tens of thousands of Kosovo residents have been left homeless by
fighting in the secessionist province, and many are still hiding in
forests hoping to escape.
	   Additionally, the EU foreign ministers are to approve spending
of dlrs 990,000 enabling ex-Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez
to act as EU envoy to the Western Balkans.
	   At a meeting Monday in Luxembourg, the ministers are expected to
proceed, though Belgrade has said it will bar Gonzalez if he
meddles in internal affairs, such as Kosovo.
	   Also, the EU may ban investments in Serbia. Until now, it has
shied away from that, together with the United States, to encourage
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic from reaching a negotiated
settlement for Kosovo _ a strategy that has not worked.
	   The EU and the United States have frozen Yugoslav assets abroad,
banned arms sales and export credits to Yugoslavia and limited
travel visas for Yugoslav officials.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country holds the EU
presidency, said Friday the Europeans were mulling how to stop the
fighting in Kosovo. ``We are looking very carefully at how we can
send a strong message ... that we regard this as an extremely
important strategic interest,'' he said after a meeting with Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok in The Hague.
	   The EU currently channels its aid for Kosovo through three
humanitarian agencies in northern Albania: Britain's Oxfam and
Children Aid Direct, and the Belgian branch of Doctors without
Borders.
	   The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated Thursday there
are some 10,000 refugees in Albania.
	   A further 20,000 people are in Kosovo near the border with
Albania and ``could pour into Albania at any moment,'' said
Petrucci. In Kosovo, the UNHCR is assisting 44,627 people who have
fled their homes because of the Serb campaign to crush militants in
the breakaway province, he said.

  Eds: UPDATES with another soldier and five Muslim rebels killed in
the Lanao clash in 2nd graf  

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Muslim rebel leader and
his followers resisted an attempt by 200 government agents to
arrest him Friday in a clash that left two people dead and two
wounded, including a 4-month-old girl, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, an army team sent to help another army patrol pinned
down by Muslim rebels was ambushed in another southern province.
Four soldiers and five rebels died and five other soldiers were
wounded in the clash, the army reported.
	   Police said about 200 soldiers and police were sent to the
village of Taluksangay near Zamboanga to serve an arrest warrant on
Kamlon Awolon, who faces kidnapping, extortion, murder and robbery
charges.
	   Awolon, who was expected to resist arrest, is a former commander
of the Moro National Liberation Front, which signed a peace pact
with the government in 1996.
	   Brig. Gen. Dominador Resos said Awolon and his men shot at the
arresting officers. In an exchange of gunfire, a former rebel and
the wife of another ex-rebel were killed and a 4-month-old baby
girl being carried by her mother was wounded.
	   A government agent who led the police to Awolon's house was also
wounded, police said.
	   Awolon and the rest of his men broke through the security cordon
and escaped, Resos added. They were being pursued by police, he
said.
	   In the ambush in Lanao del Norte province, Lt. Ruben Dangpilen
and three of his men were killed by Moro Islamic Liberation Front
guerrillas in Sapad, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) northeast of
Zamboanga, the military said. Five rebels were killed.
	   Five of Dangpilen's men were also wounded, the armed forces
headquarters reported in Manila.
	   The MILF is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups still fighting
the government. The other is the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf.
	   The government has begun peace talks with the MILF but the talks
have been put on hold until President-elect Joseph Estrada takes
office on June 30.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb ripped through a theater
in the heart of the Punjab capital on Friday, killing one person
and injuring 13 others, authorities said.
	   The bomb went off during a matinee movie in a congested central
district of Lahore, the ancient capital of Pakistan's Punjab
province, they said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility.
	   Previously, the government has accused neighboring India of
masterminding explosions, particularly in Punjab province, which
borders India.
	   Uneasy neighbors, who have fought three wars since the Asian
subcontinent gained its independence in 1947, Pakistan and India
routinely blame each other for acts of terrorism.

Duma passes bill tightening control over foreign adoptions
</HEADLINE>
  By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament passed a bill
Friday designed to encourage Russians to adopt more children and
tighten control over foreign adoptions.
	   The State Duma voted 337-0 in favor of the bill, which needs to
be approved by parliament's upper house and President Boris Yeltsin
before it becomes law.
	   Alevtina Aparina, a Communist deputy who initiated the bill, has
said the restrictions are needed to better protect Russian
children.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies who dominate the Duma have
accused foreign agencies of bribing Russian officials to arrange
illegal adoptions.
	   The bill has been strongly criticized by adoption workers and
human rights activists in Russia and abroad. They have warned that
it could discourage prospective adoptive parents and leave most
Russian orphans with no hope of finding a home. Currently there are
many more Russian orphans than prospective Russian parents.
	   The critics specifically assailed a proposal that adoption
procedures must be codified in formal agreements between Russia and
each country with prospective parents. They argued that would
result in a bureaucratic quagmire that would effectively freeze
most foreign adoptions.
	   However, that provision appeared to be eased in the final
version of the bill. Unlike the original draft which set a deadline
of Sept. 1, 1999 for other nations to reach such agreements with
Russia, the current bill contains no time limit. That means
currently pending adoptions will not be stalled by the measure.
	   Still, adoption advocates said the new bill still might leave
loopholes which would allow local officials to block adoptions.
	   ``Some regional authorities are strongly against any adoptions
by foreigners and they may use some vague clauses of the bill to
stall them,'' said Boris Altshuller, a Russian human rights
activist who runs the Child's Rights pro-adoption program.
	   He cited one recent example of officials in the Orenburg region
in southern Ural Mountains banning U.S. citizens from adopting a
hemophiliac child. ``They would rather have him die in his native
land than live on foreign soil,'' Altshuller said in a telephone
interview.
	   The bill would allow foreign adoption agencies to operate in
Russia only after their nation signs an agreement with Russia
setting out the rules. In the interim, prospective foreign parents
can use the services of proxies and interpreters.
	   According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign
adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia,
usually operating through Russian intermediaries.

Court rejects demand to redistribute tickets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A court on Friday rejected a demand to redistribute
World Cup tickets that some European lawmakers contend were
unfairly allocated in favor of French fans.
	   The court said it could not rule in the case. The reason was not
immediately clear.
	   The French Organizing Committee for the World Cup sold 961,000
of the 2.5 million tickets for the soccer championship to French
residents. A further 673,000, about 26 percent, went to national
federations and tour operators, while sponsors grabbed 436,000, or
17 percent.
	   A group of 32 members of the European Parliament went to court
May 20 to argue that the allocation left too few reasonably-priced
tickets for ordinary fans. The court had deferred its ruling until
Friday.

Trade union provides temporary support for bank strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Ionian Bank workers cajoled support from
one Greece's largest trade unions to continue their month-long
strike Friday, despite a court decision declaring it illegal.
	   The strike, staged to protest plans to privatize Greece's
fourth-largest bank, has threatened to derail government efforts to
streamline the economy and meet criteria to join the European
Union's single currency. Ionian Bank workers walked off the job May
8.
	   The court ruling Thursday was the second to declare the strike
illegal on the grounds that workers failed to appoint a skeleton
staff to serve clients.
	   In order to circumvent the court ban, workers appealed to GSEE,
one of the country's largest trade unions, to cover the strike.
	   The union vouched its support until next Wednesday, despite
internal dissent and the reluctance of the union's president, local
media reported.
	   ``The decision to extend the strike is completely unjustified,''
said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas, who added the bank's
management could go to court again for a further ruling against the
strikers.
	   If GSEE does not extend its support after Wednesday, workers
will have to decide between returning to work or risk losing their
jobs by continuing with an illegal strike.
	   Employees vowed to continue their walkout until June 19, when
shareholders will vote on the bank's sale.
	   Strikers were not swayed by a government offer Tuesday to
provide current Ionian employees with a guaranteed job until the
retirement age of 62.
	   Ionian workers are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss further
plans.

Only ``touches'' remain to conclude Hezbollah-Israel swap
</HEADLINE>
  By HUSSEIN DAKROUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Only ``final touches'' remain before a
deal is worked out to exchange the remains of Israeli soldiers for
Lebanese prisoners, the guerrilla group said Friday. One news
report said the swap was only days away.
	   Nayef Koraim, a spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, said
the deal also included Israel returning the bodies of 40 slain
Lebanese guerrillas, including that of the son of Hezbollah's
leader.
	   ``Major progress has been made in the past two days. What is
left is final touches before a prisoner exchange deal can be
concluded,'' Koraim told The Associated Press.
	   ``Such a deal can be reached soon if Israel responds positively
to these final touches,'' he said.
	   Koraim declined to say if the ``final touches'' were related to
the number or names of prisoners to be released or to give an exact
number of those expected to be freed.
	   The body of Hadi Nasrallah, the eldest son of Hezbollah
Secretary-General Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, would be among the dead
returned, Koraim said. Hadi Nasrallah, 18, was killed in fighting
with Israeli troops on Sept. 12.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross has been relaying
messages between Israel and Lebanon for months on a possible swap,
but Hezbollah has pushed for freeing a greater number of prisoners.
	   Sheik Nasrallah said in a TV interview Wednesday that a deal was
near involving more than 30 Lebanese prisoners.
	   Beirut's leftist daily As-Safir on Friday quoted unidentified
Lebanese sources as saying a prisoner swap will take place ``within
a few days.''
	   Agreement has been reached in principle on the release of 10
prisoners held in Israel and 30 others from the Khiam detention
camp in the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon, the paper said.
	   In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared less
optimistic. Asked if there was progress, Netanyahu told reporters
Thursday: ``I hope so, but it's hard to say that it's a closed
matter.''
	   Israel wants back the body parts of more than one Israeli
soldier left behind after botched operation in southern Lebanon
Sept. 5 in which a total of 12 Israeli commandos were killed.
	   Nasrallah, whose group is fighting to oust Israeli forces from
the occupied zone, said Israel holds about 210 Lebanese, 60 of them
in Israel and the rest in Khiam. The prisoners are mostly held on
suspicion of being guerrillas or aiding in attacks against Israeli
forces.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG apparently won shareholder approval
Friday to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. for 430 million pounds
(dlrs 700 million), despite angry bursts of nationalism from small
investors who wanted to keep the luxury carmaker British.
	   Proxy votes and votes from big institutional shareholders
apparently made the approval a done deal, but Vickers PLC, the
corporation selling Rolls-Royce, delayed any announcement to
formally count the ballots from the little shareholders who made
the big noise.
	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' shareholder Rodney Crowe
asked during Vickers' special meeting, in just one of the bitter
shareholder outbursts.

	   Some investors sounded like they were ready to refight World War

pounds (dlrs 554 million) from rival German automaker BMW.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers in the packed auditorium when he
referred to Volkswagen's history in Nazi Germany.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two Ethiopian military aircraft on Friday
twice bombed an Eritrean air force base in the capital Asmara.
	   On the first run, the bombers hit two hangers used as workshops,
the tarmac and a nearby junkyard.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was wearing
thin because of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory
Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   ``I am not declaring war in Eritrea. I am only saying enough is
enough to Eritrean aggression,'' Meles said after announcing that
the army had orders to ``take all necessary measures against
repeated Eritrean aggression.''
	   Meles was speaking to the press to announce acceptance of a
four-point proposal by the United States and Rwanda to end a
festering border conflict peacefully.
	   One of the recommendations of the proposal was that Eritrea
withdrawn to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea has always claimed it remains inside its own territory
as determined by Italian colonial boundaries.

Latvia says citizenship vote will improve Russian relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvia's parliament has given preliminary
approval to changes in the citizenship which have so angered Russia
that it has threatened trade sanctions against the small Baltic
state.
	   The Saeima passed the changes late Thursday by a vote of 57-16
after nine hours of often-heated debate. The measure must pass a
final reading before becoming law.
	   Russia, which accounts for about 20 percent of Latvia's foreign
trade, in April said it would impose sanctions against Latvia
unless it took quick and substantial steps to improve the status of
Latvia's ethnic Russians, about 400,000 of whom do not have
citizenship.
	   Russia's complaint was couched in harsh words _ Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov even accused Latvia of ``genocide'' _ raising fears in
Latvia that its giant neighbor was becoming increasingly
domineering.
	   ``This vote was pivotal ... and we believe the decision to
change the law will improve our relations with Russia,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Andrejs Pildegovics said Friday.
	   President Guntis Ulmanis has called on the parliament take a
final vote on the bill before the start of summer recess in two
weeks.
	   When Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991, it
granted citizenship to people who had lived there before World War
II and to their descendants. That left nearly a third of the
country's residents stateless _ most of them ethnic Russians who
had moved there under Josef Stalin's Russification drive or their
descendants.
	   The current citizenship law requires many of them to wait up to
several years before being allowed to apply for naturalization.
	   The proposed changes would grant citizenship to all children
born in Latvia since independence and would elimnate the waits for
other aspirants.
	   But naturalization would still require a proficiency test in the
Latvian language _ a sensitive issue for the ethnic Russians, many
of whom lived and worked in communities where Russian was the only
language.

World Cup: FIFA presidential hopeful says he's near victory
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY SIDDONS  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When Sepp Blatter launched his last-minute bid for
the biggest job in the world's biggest sport 2 1/2 months ago, he
was a longshot at best. Even he said so.
	   But on Friday, three days before FIFA elects a new president to
run international soccer, Blatter said something much different. He
said he was ready to win.
	   ``On Monday, I shall have enough votes to be president,'' he
said. ``Right now, I may have a little bit less. But I am very
confident.''
	   At a news conference with Michel Platini, the former French
soccer star and co-chairman of the World Cup that begins in a
gleaming new stadium north of Paris next Wednesday, Blatter refused
to estimate his votes or whether he could defeat Lennart Johansson,
the president of the European soccer union UEFA, on the first
ballot.
	   But he said a globe-trotting campaign that drained his bankbook
of almost dlrs 300,000 had won him virtually all the votes from
Asia and the Americas, gained solid support in Oceania and cut
deeply into Johansson's strongholds in Europe and Africa.
	   In a separate interview, Blatter said he was certain he had at
least 20 of the 51 votes from Europe, once virtually conceded to
Johansson.
	   In a surprise move, the English Football Association announced
Friday its support for Blatter, after initially backing Johansson's
candidacy.
	   Blatter said that the support of Platini and other officials
from France, reportedly including phone calls from President
Jacques Chirac, had swayed voters in French-speaking African
nations.
	   A candidate needs two-thirds of the expected 190 votes to win on
the first ballot and a simple majority on subsequent rounds.
Blatter's supporters have talked recently of a second-ballot
victory
	   Blatter is an insider, the secretary general of FIFA for 17
years and a high-ranking member of the staff for almost the entire
length of Joao Havelange's 24-year tenure as president.
	   But when he spoke of his plans if he wins, the man who often has
been soccer's televised face and voice sounded like a rebel.
	   Without criticizing Havelange, who urged him to battle
Johansson, Blatter said that FIFA's top job had to change, from a
part-time president to a full-time CEO.
	   ``FIFA is a company,'' he said. ``It is an industry. It is a
commercial endeavor. It is above all dedicated to those who play
football.''
	   While Havelange, a wealthy Brazilian industrialist, and his
predecessors served as non-paid presidents with hefty expense
accounts and accompanying hints of corruption, Blatter said his
CEO-style leader should be paid up front.
	   ``It's cleaner and clearer,'' he said. ``It's transparent.''
	   Platini, who would be head of soccer events in Blatter's
streamlined administration, said FIFA has become too remote from
the world's 300 million players and must do more at the grassroots
level.
	   ``What does FIFA mean to today's players? Nothing!'' Platini
said. ``The people they see are figureheads, staying in 5-star
hotels and eating in expensive restaurants. We want to change
that.''
	   Platini's organizing committee paid for the news conference,
held in a meeting room of a 4-star hotel and offering champagne and
ritzy hor d'oeurves afterward.
	   The Blatter-Johansson campaign has been an unusually dirty one
for international sports, where political decisions often are made
behind closed doors. Blatter said he was hopeful that, once the
votes were cast, the two sides would make peace.
	   ``I am sure that all will return to calm and the backhanded
tactics will be put away once this is over,'' he said.

England 321 for four at lunch on the second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa produced two crucial
blows Friday before lunch, but not before England had consolidated
its position on day two of the first cricket test at Edgbaston.
	   Resuming at 249 for one, England lost the former skipper Mike
Atherton who failed to add to his overnight 103, new captain Alec
Stewart, and Nasser Hussain to be 321 for four at lunch.
	   After losing Atherton to the 10th ball of the day, Stewart and
Hussain continued to frustrate the South Africans by scoring 60
runs in 93 minutes.
	   But with lunch in sight, medium paceman Lance Klusener and
left-arm wrist spinner Adams removed the third wicket pair in the
space of five balls.
	   Stewart (49), edged Klusener to Daryll Cullinan at first slip
and Adams trapped Hussain (35) leg before wicket with a ball that
hardly bounced.
	   The pair had hit five boundaries apiece.
	   Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash survived 15 minutes before the
break to remain unbeaten on four and two respectively.
	   Fast bowler Allan Donald, who remained a doubtful starter on the
second day due to an ankle injury, took the field and had Atherton
caught behind with the fourth ball of his first over.
	   Atherton, having remained characteristically impassive on the
first day, edged a catch to wicket keeper Boucher.
	   His 12th century lasted six minutes over six hours and he hit 12
boundaries off 279 balls.
	   According to South African team physiotherapist Craig Smith,
Donald took the field after an injection on a troubled left ankle,
a recurrence of an injury that had troubled him in Australia early
this year.
	   Adams has been the most successful bowler so far with 2-49 in 21
overs, while Klusener's wicket cost him 63 runs.

Dutch to request return of APC being used by Serbs in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Serb forces involved in the
violent crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are using an
armored personnel carrier stolen from Dutch troops, the Dutch
government admitted Friday.
	   Current affairs program Nova made the claim Thursday night after
studying video images of a recent Serbian attack on a Kosovo
village. Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Peter Mollema said the
Dutch ambassador in Belgrade would request the return of the
vehicle Friday.
	   ``We will await the outcome of this and then see what other
steps are necessary,'' Mollema added.
	   A defense analyst told Nova he was 95 percent certain that one
of the armored personnel carriers was a YPR765 taken by Bosnian
Serb forces from Dutch United Nations forces during the July 1995
attack on eastern Bosnia's Srebrenica enclave.
	   ``We expected that they would turn up somewhere,'' Defense
Ministry spokesman Bert Kreemers said. ``It is regrettable ... but
we have known for three years that these were stolen.''
	   Kreemers said that Bosnian Serbs stole 14 of the armored
vehicles following the fall of Srebrenica. Five have since been
recovered by NATO forces in Bosnia, but nine are still missing.
	   Most of the 900,000-guilder (dlrs 450,000) APCs were armed with
a heavy machine gun, and Kreemers said Serb forces could easily add
extra armaments to the vehicles.
	   More than 250 people have been killed since March, when Serbs
stepped up efforts to destroy the pro-independence Kosovo
Liberation Army, which now claims to control about 40 percent of
Kosovo's territory.

Lebanon announces Eurobond issue, financial rating downgraded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has named Merrill Lynch as lead
manager in a dlrs 500 million Eurobond issue to be launched by the
end of September, newspapers said Friday.
	   State Minister for Finance Fuad Saniora said the bond issue is
part of a plan approved by Parliament to borrow dlrs 2 billion
abroad to restructure part of the dlrs 14 billion national debt.
	   He said the bond will have a minimum seven-year maturity.
	   The announcement was made at a joint press conference Thursday
with Winthrop Smith, chairman of Merrill Lynch International, who
is on his first visit to Lebanon.
	   Another dlrs 500 million Eurobond issue will be announced later
this year, Saniora said.
	   So far, the government has issued five bonds with total value of
about dlrs 1 billion to finance the rebuilding of Lebanon's
infrastructure, which was devastated in the 1975-90 civil war.
Merrill Lynch has lead-managed issues by the Lebanese government
and banks since 1994.
	   Meanwhile, Fitch IBCA, one of the top international rating
agencies, said it was downgrading the country's financial outlook,
which is a blow to Lebanon's effort to improve economic
performance.
	   The agency said in London that it was lowering Lebanon's
long-term currency rating from BB to BB-, citing a deterioration in
the country's fiscal position in 1997 and a high deficit.
	   ``Post-war growth remains below initial expectations, reflecting
continued regional instability,'' said the agency's report carried
Friday by the English-language Daily Star.
	   Merrill Lynch Chairman Smith, speaking Friday after a meeting
with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, said he disagreed with Fitch's
decision. A day earlier, Smith said he was impressed with Lebanon's
reconstruction drive.

	   Rolls-Royce PLC, a separate company that makes jet engines,
controls the brand name and logo and has made it clear it would
rather see the deal go to BMW, which happens to be its partner in a
jet engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC has not said whether it will negotiate with
Volkswagen or try to block its use of the brand name.
	   Asked about that, the Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler,
insisted that a 25-year-old contract that would let Rolls-Roye PLC
veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Ltd. by a foreign
buyer is legally unenforceable.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the Flying Lady and Bentley.''
	   But some shareholders expressed worries that the Rolls
production line could be halted by the dispute.
	   One shareholder expressed disgust at the fight over a name that
epitomizes handmade British luxury.
	   ``It's harmful for Rolls-Royce PLC and it's harmful for Vickers
and they don't seem to care,'' Carol Day said. ``They're behaving
like 6-year-old children.''

Ethiopian jets bomb Eritrean air base; no injuries reported

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two Ethiopian military aircraft on Friday
twice bombed an Eritrean air force base in the capital Asmara.
	   On the first run, the bombers hit two hangers used as workshops,
the tarmac and a nearby junkyarair.
	   Eritrean soldiers moved in to clear civilians out of the base
which adjoins Asmara's international airport.
	   As far as could be determined, the airport itself was not hit.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was wearing
thin because of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory
Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   ``I am not declaring war in Eritrea. I am only saying enough is
enough to Eritrean aggression,'' Meles said after announcing that
the army had orders to ``take all necessary measures against
repeated Eritrean aggression.''
	   Meles was speaking to the press to announce acceptance of a
four-point proposal by the United States and Rwanda to end a
festering border conflict peacefully.
	   One of the recommendations of the proposal was that Eritrea
withdrawn to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea has always claimed it remains inside its own territory
as determined by Italian colonial boundaries.

Court throws out demand for ticket redistribution
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with case thrown out on technical legal grounds;
CORRECTS spelling to Jenkinson; ADDS background, byline  
  By RAF CASERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A court on Friday threw out a demand by a group of
European lawmakers to redistribute 700,000 World Cup tickets they
claim were unfairly allocated in favor of French fans.
	   The court said it could not rule in the case on legal grounds.
	   ``It was thrown out on a technical grounds. The court has not
dealt with the matter as such,'' said Phillip Jenkinson, attorney
for the 32 lawmakers who brought the case.
	   The court ruled that under French law, there can be no class
action-style suit involving the tickets.
	   To take the ticket matter to court, one can only seek tickets
for oneself, Jenkinson said, explaining the court's decision to
throw out the case.
	   ``By asking the court for 700,000 tickets, we were asking the
court to change the law,'' he said.
	   The French Organizing Committee (CFO) for the World Cup sold
961,000 of the 2.5 million tickets for the soccer championship to
French residents. A further 673,000, about 26 percent, went to
national federations and tour operators, while sponsors grabbed
436,000, or 17 percent.
	   The European lawmakers went to court May 20 to argue that the
allocation left too few reasonably-priced tickets for ordinary
fans. The court had deferred its ruling until Friday.
	   The CFO's ticket policy breaks three clauses in the Treaty of
Rome, Jenkinson said at the first hearing -- those that outlaw
discrimination on grounds of nationality, restraint of movement of
goods and services, and abuse of dominant position.
	   The parliamentarians also asked that the Paris court pass on the
complaint to the European Court of Justice, which could ensure that
future event organizers make no discrimination between EU
nationalities on ticket allocation.
	   They also sought ``symbolic'' damages of 250,000 francs (dlrs
41,600).

World environmentalists stress prevention over fire-fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ International environmentalists said Friday
that no amount of fire-fighting will solve the problem of burning
Indonesian jungles, only concerted and comprehensive prevention.
	   ``If there is a resurgence of fires with the continuation of the
drought ... it is unlikely that any sort of emergency measures to
put those fires out will work,'' said Jeffrey Sayer, Director
General of the Indonesian-based Centre for International Forestry
Research.
	   He was speaking to reporters in Singapore at the end of a
two-day meeting of non-governmental environmental organizations on
the Southeast Asian fires.
	   Fires last year swept through millions of hectares of Indonesian
forest, and caused billions of dollars in damage globally as haze
shrouded the region and greenhouse gases spread into the
atmosphere.
	   Simon Tay, a chairman at the Singapore Environment Council, said
there was a tendency to only react to the problem after the fires
have been set and when haze spreads across the region.
	   Tay said that ``when the haze shifts ... our attention shifts,''
and that a lack of consistent focus on the problem was a key
failure of governments and inter-governmental groups hoping to
combat the haze.
	   You can't simply ``throw water at the problem,'' but must come
up with a comprehensive, long-term solution, he said.
	   Experts at the meeting said efforts must center on promoting
alternatives to clearing land by fire, both by large industries and
small farmers in Indonesia, and on enforcing existing environmental
laws there and reforming outdated ones.
	   They also mentioned the need to tie current international aid
for Indonesia, such as packages from the International Monetary
Fund, to environmental considerations.
	   The various groups attending the conference agreed that more
international aid earmarked for preventative measures, rather than
fire fighting, would be required to avoid massive fires and ensuing
haze in the future.
	   Although their recommendations were focused at medium- to
long-term solutions, they admitted the need to start now, as the
region enters its traditional dry season and the chance of more
fires in Indonesia rises.
	   ``There is concern that the fires are still burning in places
where the weather conditions might not improve as hoped, and that
we are all at risk, and that we need therefore to get working
yesterday,'' said Nicholas Robinson, a chairman at the Swiss-based
International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
	   The non-governmental organizations said they have been invited
to future environmental meetings of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, and hope to be present at the next ASEAN gathering
on June 18 and 19 in Singapore.

Train engineers slow down to protest low wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Trains slowed down Friday across Croatia
as part of a drivers' protest against the government's refusal to
raise their wages.
	   The head of the train drivers union, Vladimir Gjurec, said all
1,448 Croatian train engineers joined the protest, slowing down
their trains by 20 kilometer (12.5 miles) per hour.
	   The union requested a 20-percent increase of their average wage
of an equivalent dlrs 250, but the management of the state-run
railroad company has failed to meet the demand.
	   The move caused delays of up to 40 minutes of all trains, Vlado
Carevic, head of the train traffic services, told the state-run
news agency HINA.
	   The union did not immediately say whether the protest would
continue.
	   The government of President Franjo Tudjman recently has been
faced with increasing popular dissatisfaction. The majority of
Croats' average salary is dlrs 350 a month, while a newly-enriched
elite emerged after the war, reportedly through corruption and
financial scandals.
	   On Thursday, teachers went on one-day strike, requesting the
government to raise their incomes by 12.5 percent.
	   The pensioners also announced protest rallies if the government
does not increase their pensions.

Dai-ichi Kangyo to buy shares in Kankaku Securities
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES throughout with announcement of purchase, details,
quotes  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. will buy 300 million new
shares in Kankaku Securities Co. for 30 billion yen (dlrs 215.8
million), boosting its share in the brokerage to 37.1 percent,
Kankaku announced Friday.
	   DKB, one of Japan's biggest banks, is already the largest
shareholder of the second-tier securities company. With the July 17
payment, the DKB group of companies will hold a 54 percent stake in
Kankaku.
	   The DKB-Kankaku deal is the first case of a major bank acquiring
a securities as a subsidiary since Japan's Antimonopoly Law was
revised last year to allow such holdings by banks.
	   Kankaku's president, Chuichi Numata, said the fund injection was
part of efforts to strengthen its financial position as the
Japanese government moves forward with financial deregulation and
market reform.
	   Numata said the increase in DKB's share in Kankaku will also
serve to clarify to investors the already-strong relationship
between the bank and the securities company.
	   Kankaku announced a restructuring program in November last year,
under which it will withdraw from overseas operations, restructure
its domestic retail network, cut costs, and reduce staff.
	   Kankaku also said Friday it will reduce its capital by 20
billion yen (dlrs 143.9 million) by transferring some funds to its
capital reserves. The company's capital will stand at 46 billion
(dlrs 331 million) after the fund injection from DKB.
	   Kankaku said its capital-adequacy ratio will rise to 330 percent
after receiving the new funds from DKB. The company's
capital-adequacy ratio was 215 percent at the close of the fiscal
year ended March.
	   Friday's news comes only a few weeks after Dai-Ichi Securities,
another second-tier Japanese brokerage house, said it will issue 80
million new shares worth 8 billion yen (dlrs 57.6 million) in July
to five group companies of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   Numata said that Kankaku and DKB Securities, a fully-owned
subsidiary of DKB, would concentrate on different segments of the
securities industry.

	   Around 680 refugees are due to travel back to Ethiopia in
convoys organized by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva.
	   Some of the refugees have been in exile in Sudan for 20 years
after fleeing fighting which broke out between Ethiopian government
forces and Eritrean independence fighters.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.
	   The final convoys bring to an end a five year UNHCR repatriation
program which has helped some 71,000 Ethiopian refugees to return
to Ethiopia.
	   An additional 8,500 still in Sudan have told UNHCR they want to
stay there and are having their cases reviewed, agency spokesman
Paul Stromberg said.
	   UNHCR has also discussed with Eritrea's government the
possibility of returning some 150,000 Eritrean refugees still in
Sudan, Stromberg said. If all goes well, the return could take
place this autumn.
	   Meanwhile, another UNHCR repatriation program in Africa was
completed this week, the agency said.
	   Some 370 Tuareg refugees, described by UNHCR as ``mostly nomadic
people,'' were returned from Algeria to Niger, the last of some
4,000 who have returned after fleeing armed conflict and drought in
Niger in the early 1990s.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 50 Kosovo Albanians have
been killed and about 200 are missing since Serbian government
forces started an offensive in the independence-minded province a
week ago, an ethnic Albanian leader said Friday.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so Kosovo Albanians who trekked into neighboring Albania
overnight had reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people,
said to have died of exhaustion, and three small children. About
10,000 refugees are now gathered around Tropoja in northern
Albania.
	   In the reported government offensive in Kosovo, four villages
populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed, and another eight
badly damaged, said Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main party.
	   Sixteen other villages are deserted as residents fled, Cacaj
added.
	   He listed more than 50 dead and some 200 missing from the latest
offensive, concentrated around Decani, some 70 kilometers (45
miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   In Novi Poklek, a village much closer to Pristina, residents
said Serbian police attacked on Sunday, taking away some 25-30 men
after a four-hour blitz, Associated Press photographer Santiago
Lyon reported.
	   Three-quarters of the homes in the village, some 25 kilometers
(12 miles) west of Pristina, were burned and destroyed, Lyon said.
Residents said women and children had been allowed to flee. Only
about 15 people, mostly men, could be seen in the razed settlement
Friday.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts such as Cacaj's are impossible to verify independently,
as both Serbian police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ fighting for independence _ block adequate access to
journalists and even humanitarian workers.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders say information comes from individuals
who manage to pass Serbian roadblocks and reach Pristina.
	   Telephone access to the area of the offensive has been cut for
days.
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro, which with
Serbia, forms Yugoslavia.
	   Late Thursday, an unidentified elderly Albanian in the area who
had remained in his village shot dead three Serbian policemen
trying to loot his house, Cacaj said.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina, close to the Serbian
authorities, said meanwhile that a Yugoslav army general, Nebojsa
Pavkovic, made a surprise visit to a still-inhabited village in the
area, Batusa, inviting any Albanians who fled to return on
condition armed men turn in weapons and halt attacks on police and
army.
	   During Bosnia's 1992-95 war, such warnings were often a prelude
to a Serb attack on grounds that the community in question failed
to comply.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.
	   The clandestine KLA, which first surfaced in 1996, says the
peaceful principles of the top Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are futile.
	   A delegation picked by Rugova and officials chosen by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad
autonomy in 1989, opened a dialogue under Western pressure last
month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts. The Serbs showed up anyway for the talks,
to which Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is serving as unofficial mediator.
	   Hill noted that it is ``extremely difficult'' to get a true
picture of events around Decani.
	   ``The problem is you talk to one side, you get one view, you
talk to the other side, you get a view of 180 degrees,'' he said.
	   Rugova's aides are showing more and more sympathy for the KLA,
which only weeks ago they shunned.
	   ``Serbs systematically shell the villages in the war zone, burn
and destroy Albanian settlements,'' said Rugova's spokesman Xhemail
Mustafa. ``The Serb regime has declared and imposed war on ethnic
Albanians.''
	   ``Therefore, we understand the people's self-organizing on the
ground and their efforts to defend from aggression,'' Mustafa
added.

	   TROPOJA, Albania (AP) _ Men taking their families across the
border from Kosovo to Albania to escape a Serb artillery offensive
are purchasing arms and other supplies _ and then are returning to
fight the enemy.
	   They all have the same objective: to fight the Serbs and defend
what is left of their homes in Kosovo, a province in the Serb
republic of Yugoslavia where ethnic Albanians overwhelmingly
outnumber Serbs.
	   ``This is not a surrender,'' said a 30-year-old man as he
registered his wife and four children as refugees at the town's
mosque. ``All men will go back and fight,'' he said, on condition
of anonymity.
	   The men say they are tired of waiting for foreign powers to
force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the assault on
their villages, which have caused tens of thousands to flee.
	   ``We waited for years for the international community to prevent
the outbreak of this war,'' said Shaban Lukja, 48, from Decani, a
battlefield town in Kosovo. ``But now that there is little hope
left, we shall take care of it ourselves.''
	   Horses and mules loaded with guns, vans without license plates
transporting young men in camouflage uniforms and the sound of
sporadic gunfire make this border town look like a military base.
	   While thousands of women, children, and elderly have found
refuge with families or in makeshift shelters, the men, with few
exceptions, are gearing up for war.
	   Youths under age 20 are being trained to handle guns, and no
attempt is being made to hide the military preparations.
	   The Kosovo Liberation army, an underground guerrilla force
fighting for Kosovo's independence, is not much in evidence. Only a
few men believed to be KLA members have been seen in the area.
	   But whether or not the Kosovo men are members of the clandestine
army seems irrelevant. They all have one and the same objective: to
fight back the Serbs and defend what's left of their homes.
	   In Tropoja, guns are changing hands in the central piazza. One
Kalashnikov sells for 350 German marks (almost dlrs 200), whereas a
camouflage uniform costs 50 marks (30 dlrs).
	   The parties in the business are happy _ the Albanians who make
money so crucial to survive in Europe's poorest country, and Kosovo
Alabanians who get weapons needed desperately in order to resist
what they call ``ethnic cleansing,'' _ the Serbian attempt to drive
out ethnic Albanians, at least from the border region.
	   Tropoja is a small town in the impoverished north of Albania,
where about 10,000 ethnic Albanian refugees fled to escape a Serb
offensive that has devastated dozens of villages in the besieged
region of Decani. Newcomers are directed to other towns because
Tropoja is overflowing.
	   The Albanian government can do little to stop the Kosovo men
from organizing and arming on Albanian territory.
	   About a million guns were looted in Albania last year when the
country descended into chaos and lawlessness following the collapse
of pyramid schemes in which most people lost their life savings.
	   ``The government cannot stop the arms smuggling, guns are out
there,'' said Capt. Astrit Madani, a border police commander.
	   The Albanian government has called for a NATO presence along its
northern border, admitting it cannot stop or control all the
traffic across its northern border. It lacks both equipment and
trained personnel.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Dozens of Germany's fastest trains were
idled Friday for inspections as investigators confirmed that a
wheel failure appeared to be the most likely cause of the country's
worst rail accident in more than 50 years.
	   The confirmed death toll rose to 96 at midday Friday after
rescue crews found a body beneath a 10-meter-long section of a
collapsed bridge.
	   Ninety-three bodies have been recovered at the scene of
Wednesday's disaster, and three people died in hospitals.
	   ``We have to fear that we will find more bodies under here as we
go along,'' said Eschede police spokesman Joachim Haack. In
addition to the train passengers, rescue workers are also looking
for two maintenance men who were working on an adjoining track at
the time of the crash.
	   Deutsche Bahn took all of its its first-generation InterCity
Express trains, introduced in 1991, out of service Thursday night
for urgent inspections. Ten of the 59 surviving trains returned to
duty Friday.
	   In Bonn, federal railway authority spokesman Jens Boehlke
confirmed that a steel tire encircling the wheel disc on the first
car behind the lead locomotive had broken. A piece of the tire _
which forms the rolling surface of the wheel _ was found wedged
into the chassis of the coach, Boehlke said.
	   There was no indication whether the tire failed because of metal
fatigue or because of damage from an outside force, Boehlke said.
There had been no similar failure since the high-speed InterCity
Express trains went into service, Boehlke said.
	   Damage to track and ties indicated the wheel apparently
fractured about 6 kms (3.7 miles) from the overpass in Eschede.
That tallied with reports from survivors that they heard a loud
noise and felt vibrations minutes before the crash.
	   Boehlke indicated that the damaged tire was torn away, which
meant there was nothing to prevent the disc from straying off the
rail.
	   It is possible that the damaged first car struck the bridge, but
that several cars got through in the moment before the massive
concrete deck crushed the train, Boehlke said.
	   The first car broke away from the locomotive, but came to rest
upright with the second and third cars. Officials say the greatest
number of dead were in the fourth car, which got through the bridge
but flipped over on its side.
	   Two bodies were recovered earlier in the day from the last major
part of wreckage to be excavated, a dining car flattened by the
overpass.
	   ``It would appear that the restaurant car was closed for some
reason, otherwise there would have been more people in it,'' Haack
said earlier.
	   A special commission of police, rail and other experts,
supervised by prosecutors, were working to identify the cause of
the disaster, and investigators were aggressively searching for
evidence in an area extending 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) down the
line, Haack said.
	   Attention centered on the steel ``tires'' which are fitted to
the wheel discs. The tires must be replaced from time to time
because of wear.
	   State authorities originally estimated that as many as 100 or
more were killed when the Hamburg-bound InterCity Express 884
derailed at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour near the small town
of Eschede, 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   On Thursday, officials lowered the speed limit for all ICE
trains from 280 kilometers (175 miles) per hour to 160 kph (100
mph) until the entire fleet could be inspected.
	   Whatever caused the accident set off a catastrophic chain of
events: part of the train knocked down a highway overpass, the
collapsing bridge crushed some of the trailing cars, and the rest
of the train jackknifed against the tangle of steel and concrete.
	   State officials said 200 people were injured, of whom 95 were
treated in hospitals.
	   ``Before everything happened, I felt a rumbling and suddenly a
horrible cracking. The lights went out and the carriage sprang from
the tracks,'' said Angelika Hauser, 32, a pharmacist from Augsburg.
	   Hauser, who was quoted in Bild, suffered a fractured skull and
broken back.
	   ``I remember only that people and seats were all over the
place,'' an unidentified woman told n-tv television in one of the
first interviews with one of the scores of injured survivors
evacuated to hospitals in helicopters.

	   FOR Tan Sri Bernard Giluk Dompok, his appointment as Sabah's new
Chief Minister for a two-year term under the rotation system is
significant.
	   This is because he will have to lead the State Barisan Nasional
into the next State election, scheduled to be held by next March.
	   As head of the State Government and chairman of the nine-member
State BN, Dompok has to demonstrate his vigour and vitality to
ensure a victory for his party in the election.
	   With less than a year for the current term of the State Assembly
to expire, and with analysts saying Parti Bersatu Sabah is slowly
gaining momentum, especially with the Kadazandusun community, the
election is seen as an opportunity for Dompok to prove that he
commands the majority support.
	   Already questions have been asked about whether Dompok is
capable of leading the BN into the next State election considering
he has yet to prove his political strength after leaving PBS to
form Parti Demokratik Sabah.
	   Dompok and the 10 Assemblymen from the PDS won their State
Assembly seats as PBS candidates in the 1994 State elections.
	   This will be the first State election under the rotation system
of the Chief Ministership introduced by the BN in 1994 after it
took over the State administration from the PBS.
	   Under the system, the Chief Ministership will be rotated for a
two-year term among the Bumiputera Muslims, Chinese and non-Muslim
Bumiputeras.
	   Tun Sakaran Dandai, who is now the Yang di-Pertua Negri of
Sabah, became the first Chief Minister under the system, and
Dompok's appointment last week completes the first phase of the
rotation.
	   It is said that Dompok's surprise defeat to unknown Paul
Nointien of PBS in the 1995 parliamentary elections was because the
constituents were unhappy with him. And some say it was due to his
decision to leave the PBS.
	   The State BN expects Dompok's appointment as Chief Minister to
strengthen the support and belief of the Kadazandusun community of
the BN's power-sharing concept.
	   If Dompok hopes to gain the respect and confidence of the other
component parties, it would be important that he provide leadership
based on consultation and trust.
	   It will be wise to take heed of the advice of Sabah Umno liaison
committee chief, Datuk Osu Sukam, that the fulfilment of the
promise to rotate the Chief Ministership should not be allowed to
overshadow efforts to win the State elections.
	   He said what matters was the ability of the State BN Government
to unite the people and to bring about progress.
	   It is imperative that Dompok recognises the fact that it is
crucial for the BN Government to provide an effective
administration to gain the confidence of the people.
	   Shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
announced his appointment, Dompok acknowledged that he would be
shouldering a ``very heavy burden''.
	   Dompok said he would have the difficult task of putting Sabah's
economy back on track as the State had not been spared the current
economic problems affecting the country.
	   To ensure continuity in the smooth implementation of policies
and programmes that had been laid out by the BN, Dompok retained
all the Ministers and his predecessor Datuk Yong Teck Lee in his
new Cabinet line- up.
	   Dompok will, however, have to appoint a new Muslim Bumiputera
Finance Minister and Deputy Chief Minister to fill the vacancy left
by Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh who declined re-appointment.
	   It was a wise decision for Dompok to retain all the Ministers
because to do otherwise would be disruptive to the State
administration.
	   However, there had been questions as to why Dompok made the
unprecedented move of including Yong into the Cabinet.
	   Yong is now the Minister in the Chief Minister's Department and
he is to oversee the State Economic Planning Unit.
	   Nevertheless, Yong's inclusion did not come as a surprise as on
his last day as Chief Minister he told a Press conference that he
was ready to continue serving the Government.
	   Perhaps, Dompok sees Yong as an asset because he could share his
experience as the immediate pastChief Minister and provide input to
accelerate economic development.
	   Dompok needs a reliable and action-oriented Cabinet to deal with
the many complex and controversial problems and issues affecting
the State, such as the problems posed by illegal immigrants and
foreign workers.
	   While the smooth transition of power between Yong and Dompok was
seen as proof of maturity, it remains to be seen if the people at
the grassroots have the same level of understanding.
	   The next State election will determine whether or not the
rotation of the Chief Minister's position is well-received by the
people.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Separatist Tamil Tiger rebels claimed
Friday to have killed at least 100 soldiers in the latest fighting
in northern Sri Lanka, and army officers said over 400 soldiers
were wounded.
	   Also Friday, President Chandrika Kumaratunda ordered all news
reports on Sri Lanka's civil war be cleared by military censors.
The government gave no reason for the measure, which it has used in
the past. It also did not say how long censorship would last.
	   The guerrillas' clandestine radio said they lost 20 fighters as
they beat back a government offensive Thursday.
	   The military spokesman would not confirm the casualties, but
reported heavy fighting after government troops attacked rebel
defenses near Kilinochchi, 170 miles to the north. The two-pronged
assault aimed to wrest the region's main highway from guerrilla
control.
	   Some army officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 34
soldiers were killed and 420 wounded in 24 hours of fighting that
saw troops advance only a half mile.
	   In Colombo, state-run radio announced that hospitals were in
urgent need of blood donations for the wounded. On Thursday,
ambulances raced to hospitals in the Sri Lankan capital with
wounded soldiers who had been airlifted from Kilinochchi.
	   Government forces have been battling since May 1997 to capture a
vital highway connecting the Jaffna Peninsula with the rest of Sri
Lanka. The army captured the peninsula in 1996 from the Tamil
rebels, who had run the area like a mini-state for five years.
	   So far, the troops have captured about two-thirds of the
highway, with 17 miles to go. At present, Jaffna's 500,000 people
rely on air and sea deliveries of food and other supplies.
	   The clandestine radio, Voice of Tigers, said the rebels found
the bodies of 40 Sri Lankan soldiers and plan to hand them over to
the Red Cross later today. It also said government troops carried
away nearly 60 bodies.
	   Their claims could not be verified, since the military has
sealed the area off.
	   The rebels, who are fighting for a separate homeland in the
north and east, accuse the Sinhalese majority of oppressing the
Tamil minority. The war has claimed 52,000 lives since it began in
1983.

Senior EU official calls on Japan to jump-start its economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Concerned that Japan has not done enough to bolster
its sagging economy, a senior European Union official on Friday
urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand with permanent tax cuts
and more deregulation.
	   ``Our overall interest is to avoid a major crisis in Japan,''
said Hans Friedrich Beseler, EU director general for external
relations, after two days of talks between European economic
officials and Japanese counterparts.
	   Nurturing the Japanese economy back to good health is vital for
helping the rest of the Asian region recover from its recent
financial crisis, added Beseler, the head of the EU delegation.
	   Beseler called on Japan to speed planned economic reforms
designed to deregulate its economy and suggested that permanent tax
cuts could provide a needed boost to lift consumer spending.
	   The Japanese government has implemented a series of temporary
income tax cuts, but has been reluctant to make these permanent due
to fears of a ballooning budget deficit.
	   The European trade official expressed concern over Japan's
mounting trade surplus with EU member nations and the dramatic
weakening of the yen in recent months, which makes Japanese imports
less expensive in Europe.
	   During the two-day talks, the EU team met with Eisuke
Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, and Sakuya Fujiwara, deputy governor of the Bank of Japan,
among other Japanese officials.

Latvia says citizenship vote will improve Russian relations
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Restores word `laws' in first graf.  

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvia's parliament has given preliminary
approval to changes in the citizenship laws which have so angered
Russia that it has threatened trade sanctions against the small
Baltic state.
	   The Saeima passed the changes late Thursday by a vote of 57-16
after nine hours of often-heated debate. The measure must pass a
final reading before becoming law.
	   Russia, which accounts for about 20 percent of Latvia's foreign
trade, in April said it would impose sanctions against Latvia
unless it took quick and substantial steps to improve the status of
Latvia's ethnic Russians, about 400,000 of whom do not have
citizenship.
	   Russia's complaint was couched in harsh words _ Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov even accused Latvia of ``genocide'' _ raising fears in
Latvia that its giant neighbor was becoming increasingly
domineering.
	   ``This vote was pivotal ... and we believe the decision to
change the law will improve our relations with Russia,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Andrejs Pildegovics said Friday.
	   President Guntis Ulmanis has called on the parliament take a
final vote on the bill before the start of summer recess in two
weeks.
	   When Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991, it
granted citizenship to people who had lived there before World War
II and to their descendants. That left nearly a third of the
country's residents stateless _ most of them ethnic Russians who
had moved there under Josef Stalin's Russification drive or their
descendants.
	   The current citizenship law requires many of them to wait up to
several years before being allowed to apply for naturalization.
	   The proposed changes would grant citizenship to all children
born in Latvia since independence and would elimnate the waits for
other aspirants.
	   But naturalization would still require a proficiency test in the
Latvian language _ a sensitive issue for the ethnic Russians, many
of whom lived and worked in communities where Russian was the only
language.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Consortiums operating the public transport
service at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport have submitted a
separate fare structure for passengers travelling between the
airport and the Federal capital's outer limits.
	   Similar to the zone system being implemented at the Sultan Abdul
Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang, KLIA's zone fare
structure would cover a minimum radius of 15km and a maximum of
105km.
	   It is learnt the respective demarkations have been identified
and submitted to the Entrepreneur Development Ministry for
approval.
	   The proposed zones are surrounding KLIA Sepang and Salak Tinggi
(Zone 1); Banting, Beranang, Dengkil, Labu, Mantin and Sepang (Zone
2); Bangi, Beranang, Nilai, Subang Jaya and USJ (Zone 3); Kajang,
Morib, Serdang, Seremban, Sungei Besi and Shah Alam (Zone 4).
	   The remaining proposed zones are Bangsar, Cheras, Damansara, KL
City Centre, Klang, Jalan Klang Lama, Petaling Jaya, Port Dickson
and Taman Tun Dr Ismail (Zone 5); Jalan Duta, Linggi, Sungai Buloh
(Zone 6); Ampang, Kuala Pilah, Segambut, Teluk Kemang (Zone 7);
Setapak, Kuala Selangor, Wangsa Maju (Zone 8) and Batu Caves,
Jinjang, Kepong, Selayang, Genting Highlands (Zone 9).
	   It was learnt the proposed fare structure, under the zone
system, ranged from RM30 to RM120 for a one-way trip for those
using the limousine service.
	   It could not be immediately established if executive coaches
would be introduced to service them.
	   This afternoon, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed announced a fare structure, ranging from RM6.50 to RM88
one-way, from KLIA to the Klang Valley, including the city centre.
	   Although the Minister affirmed the trial runs would commence
tomorrow, an industry source expected problems.
	   ``While the Minister may have announced the rates, one wonders
what the midnight charges would be,'' the source said.
	   Explaining, the source said there were late flights at Subang
and once the passenger checks out past midnight, a different rate
is imposed.
	   ``KLIA Sepang would also have late flights ... what would the
rates be then?''
	   Besides this, the source added, KTM Bhd's Komuter service and
stage bus services begin at dawn and end at midnight.
	   ``What options would passengers have between midnight and
dawn,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - KUB Holdings Bhd has suspended its
operation of Somatel (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd's office in Mogadishu,
Somalia, following the murder of its Malaysian manager on Monday.
	   In the incident, Lt Commander (Rtd) Mohamed Rashid Musa, 40, was
walking to a mosque to perform the Magrib prayers when three men
dragged him to a van.
	   He was shot in the head when he resisted and died at the Digfair
Hospital, about 30 minutes later.
	   KUB Holdings corporate communications general manager Natrah
Abdullah said today the company had decided to suspend Somatel's
operations and had recalled two other Malaysians working with the
firm.
	   ``We have directed our staff, Sabri Hashim and Azhar Othman, to
return to Malaysia before a decision on Somatel is made.
	   ``At this juncture, we cannot say when Somatel will resume
operation.''
	   KUB Holdings is the majority shareholder of the
telecommunication company while the remaining 30 per cent is held
by Somali Telecommunications Services.
	   Somatel has a staff of 96, of whom four are Malaysians. The
other Malaysian with the company returned about two weeks ago.
	   On the funeral arrangements, Natrah said Rashid's remains,
accompanied by Sabri and Azhar, had been flown to Dubai and would
be brought to Kuala Lumpur tomorrow.
	   While describing Rashid as a ``committed and dedicated man'',
Natrah said he was the first Malaysian to be based in Somalia, on
completion of the United Nations Operations in Somalia (Unosom)
peacekeeping mission in 1995.
	   Rashid was Malaysia's naval representative for the Special
Technical Team which planned and co-ordinated the withdrawal of
about 20,000 multinational soldiers from Somalia, following the end
of the UN's mandate in the country.
	   In Klang, Rashid's mother, Hasnah Mohamad, 57, said he had
called four times on Monday, speaking to her thrice, and once to
his wife, Hasnah Mohamed Sharkan.
	   ``Rashid told me that he intended to return to Malaysia in two
weeks as he had several matters to attend to,'' she said, when met
at her home in Taman Sri Andalas today.
	   Rashid's wife, Hasnah, said her husband had advised her to look
after their four children and ensure that they did not miss their
daily prayers.
	   The children are Masturah, 14, Abu Bakar, 13, Mohamed Ali, 10,
and Ahmad Umar, six.

Volkswagen apparently wins control of Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with BMW reaction, enthusiast group's bid also
rejected; combines previous  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG apparently won shareholder approval
Friday to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. for 430 million pounds
(dlrs 700 million), despite angry bursts of nationalism from small
investors who wanted to keep the luxury carmaker British.
	   Proxy votes and votes from big institutional shareholders
apparently made the approval a done deal, but Vickers PLC, the
corporation selling Rolls-Royce, delayed any announcement to
formally count the ballots from the little shareholders who made
the big noise.
	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' shareholder Rodney Crowe
asked during Vickers' special meeting.
	   ``What are we going to have? A flying lady on the front of the
Beetle?'' Crowe said later.
	   Some investors sounded like they were ready to refight World War
II in a session where they first rejected a bid of 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) from rival German automaker BMW.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers in the packed auditorium when he
referred to Volkswagen's history in Nazi Germany.
	   Volkswagen faces not just vocal objections but some real
potential hurdles at it moves to take over production of luxury
Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, which cost about dlrs 250,000 each.
	   The jilted suitor, BMW, supplies some engines to Rolls-Royce and
has threatened to cut off deliveries. BMW spokesman Uwe Mahla said
in Munich that Friday's developments were ``for us a very suprising
situation,'' and BMW sources said executives were holding an
emergency meeting.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC, a separate company that makes jet engines,
controls the brand name and logo and has made it clear it would
rather see the deal go to BMW, which happens to be its partner in a
jet engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC has not said whether it will negotiate with
Volkswagen or try to block its use of the brand name.
	   Asked about that, the Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler,
insisted that a 25-year-old contract that would let Rolls-Roye PLC
veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Ltd. by a foreign
buyer is legally unenforceable.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the Flying Lady and Bentley.''
	   But some shareholders expressed worries that the Rolls
production line could be halted by the dispute.
	   And at least one expressed disgust at the fight over a name that
epitomizes handmade British luxury.
	   ``It's harmful for Rolls-Royce PLC and it's harmful for Vickers
and they don't seem to care,'' Carol Day said. ``They're behaving
like 6-year-old children.''
	   The takeover announcement also was delayed by a Rolls-Royce
enthusiasts group, Crewe Motors, which claimed it was on the verge
of putting together a 500 million pound (dlrs 815 million) offer
from private backers.
	   Its chairman, Michael Shrimpton, who has failed to put together
previous bids, forced Vickers to adjourn the meeting for nearly one
hour, but the Vickers chairman was unconvinced and refused any
further delays.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Terrestrial television stations have been
given a grace period of six months from now to fully abide by the
Information Ministry's recent directive to air only local
programmes during prime time.
	   However, Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat said today
the stations had to enforce the ruling partially.
	   He made the decision following an appeal from the stations.
	   ``They are willing to adhere but they are facing many problems.
At this stage, they can only implement the ruling partially,'' he
told reporters after attending the Cabinet meeting.
	   Among the problems cited by the stations' officials were getting
local programmes. This is because many production houses are facing
economic problems.
	   Mohamed said the television stations also stated that they
needed time to reschedule their programmes.
	   Last month, Mohamed had announced that all terrestrial
television stations must air local programmes during prime time
from 8pm to 10pm beginning from Monday or face having their
licences revoked.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Cabinet today ordered the National
Disaster Management and Relief Committee to call for an immediate
meeting with Indonesia for steps to tackle forest fires and the
haze to be implemented fast.
	   Committee chairman Datuk Mohamed Rahmat said this was to allay
fears among participants of Sukom '98 and convince them that
measures were being taken to prevent the haze during the event.
	   ``There are less than 100 days to the Games. Steps have to be
taken to convince them,'' he said after the Cabinet meeting.
	   As such, he would arrange for the meeting to be held in
Indonesia this month.
	   The meeting, to be the first for the recently formed joint
action committee, is to discuss the implementation of measures
stipulated under the memorandum of understanding on disasters
between Malaysia and Indonesia.
	   The MoU was signed by Mohamed and Indonesia's then National
Disaster Management Co-ordinating Board chairman Azwar Anas on Dec
11.
	   The initial objective of the MoU was for Malaysia and Indonesia
to collectively tackle the haze problem but it was later decided to
include other areas of co-operation.
	   It now covers all natural or man-made disasters.
	   Indonesia will be represented by its Minister for People's
Welfare and Poverty Alleviation Haryono Suyono and Mohamed will
lead Malaysia's delegation.
	   ``We have to implement the measures under the MoU so that
Indonesia's open burning problems can be tackled collectively to
prevent a recurrence of the haze,'' said Mohamed, who is also the
Information Minister.
	   Mohamed said a change in wind direction, from northeasterly to
southwesterly, would bring smoke to Malaysia if there were fires in
Indonesia. Therefore, early measures need to be taken to prevent a
haze.
	   Mohamed said latest satellite images showed several hotspots in
Sumatra.
	   Meanwhile, France has agreed to assist Malaysia with expertise
in fighting land and forest fires.
	   This was made possible with the disaster management and relief
agreement signed between Mohamed and French Home Minister Jean
Pierre Chevenement in Paris last Monday.
	   Among others, Malaysia is planning to make use of France's
training institutes to train local fire-fighters.
	   Mohamed said he had seen France's sophisticated fire-fighting
equipment.
	   Asked if Malaysia had to purchase or borrow the equipment, he
said: ``They are willing to negotiate terms.''
	   Malaysia is also planning to purchase aircraft, not necessarily
from France, which can be used to fight land and forest fires
locally and across the border.

	   KUANTAN, Wed. - A routine check at a police roadblock led to the
discovery of two bodies in a car at the km100 Kuantan-Segamat
highway yesterday.
	   Both were male and believed to have been murdered.
	   One body, with a stab wound in the chest, was found wrapped in a
blanket in the boot of the white Toyota Corolla. The other victim,
suspected to have been strangled, was found in the rear seat.
	   The driver and a passenger, both Singaporeans, were arrested.
	   The car was heading towards Kuantan when it was stopped by
policemen near the junction to Bandar Muadzam Shah about 3.30pm.
	   Police have declined to give the identities of the deceased, who
were Malaysian businessmen aged 30 and 29, of Malacca.
	   They have obtained a three-day remand order to detain the
foreigners, aged 28 and 32.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Cabinet today approved public
transportation fares ranging from RM6.50 to RM88 for a one-way trip
to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang.
	   The fares structure for KTM Bhd Komuter trains, executive
coaches, limousine and multi-purpose vehicle service was
comparatively lower than that of airports in the region and
globally, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed
said.
	   ``After numerous reviews, we have concluded that this would be
the most appropriate fare structure,'' he said.
	   Speaking to reporters after opening the Ministry's Small
Entrepreneur Service Centre at Mara headquarters in Jalan Raja
Laut, he said: ``When compared to similar services offered at
airports in the region, it (fare structure at KLIA) is among the
lowest.''
	   For limousines, passengers who pay for the budget service will
travel in a Proton Wira, while those who opt for the premier
service will ride in a Proton Perdana, Mercedes Benz or the Fiat
Ulysses MPV.
	   ``The consortium overseeing the limousine service has prepared
350 Wiras, 200 Perdanas, 150 Mercedes Benz and 100 MPVs to
complement the fleet,''
	   Mustapa said.
	   ``An added incentive for passengers who opt for the limousine
service is the chance to purchase a return trip ticket at RM98 and
RM140 for the budget and premier services respectively,'' he said.
	   Asked to comment on the reduction in the number of vehicles
complementing the fleet from the previous figure of 1,100, Mustapa
said: ``They (the consortium) revised the figures based on their
forecast of passenger traffic.''
	   However, he gave the assurance that there would be sufficient
public transportation at KLIA.
	   Red-and-white taxis operating in the Klang Valley will also
allowed to ferry passengers to the new airport at RM46.
	   ``A surcharge, which is yet to be decided, will be imposed as
these the drivers are not allowed to fetch passengers from the
airport,'' he said.
	   Mustapa said the executive coaches, to be operated by Kuala
Lumpur City Bus, would offer two types of service.
	   ``The dedicated service between KLIA and KLCB's temporary
terminal in Jalan Duta will operate semi-luxury and luxury
fleets,'' he said.
	   ``Those travelling from KLIA to the city aboard the executive
coach (luxury service) will be given the option to alight at the
temporary terminal or at any six designated hotels along the
route.''
	   Mustapa said KLCB would also operate a stage bus service from
its temporary terminal to KLIA to cater to the needs of employees
there.
	   Charging RM7.70 per trip, the stage bus will pick up passengers
at Subang and Kampung Subang before proceeding to KLIA. It is also
available to the public.
	   Those using the KTM Komuter service will board at the Kuala
Lumpur station and alight at the Batang Benar station (Nilai)
before boarding a KLCB shuttle service to the airport.
	   ``We have instructed the companies to commence trial runs for
the respective services this Friday and Saturday,'' Mustapa said.
	   A final trial run will be carried out about four days before the
KLIA's official opening on June 29.

Lebed inaugurated as governor of Siberian region

Lebed vowing to reorganize administration.  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was
sworn in Friday as governor of a huge region in central Siberia _ a
post seen by many as a springboard to the presidency.
	   During the solemn inauguration ceremony, Lebed took an oath on
the Bible and was blessed by Bishop Antoniy, leader of the Russian
Orthodox Church in the Krasnoyarsk region.
	   He dressed in a tuxedo for the occasion _ a significant choice
of clothes in a country where tuxedos were once deemed unacceptably
``bourgeois.''
	   Lebed, a gravel-voiced former paratroop general, ran for
president in 1996 and has long said he plans to run again. However,
he played down those ambitions during the gubernatorial race,
saying he would only run for president in 2000 if he succeeds in
improving the economy in Krasnoyarsk.
	   Speaking to reporters after his inauguration, he criticized
Moscow for keeping the lion's share of the country's money, but
said he hoped to reach agreement with the federal government over
funding rather than provoke a confrontation.
	   ``All the blood is in the head. I fear the country may suffer a
heart attack,'' he said, in one of his typically homespun
aphorisms.
	   Returning to a campaign theme, he promised a dramatic
reorganization of the regional administration, and said all
government workers in the region will have to prove their worth or
face dismissal, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian business mogul who
supported Lebed's run for governor, attended his inauguration and
hailed him as a ``serious Russian politician.''
	   However Berezovsky, now serving in government as executive
secretary of the alliance former Soviet republics, quickly added
that Lebed would be a ``big problem for the nation'' if elected
Russian president.
	   Berezovsky has previously said that he helped Lebed's election
in Krasnoyarsk so he would get bogged down in the region's problems
and be less able to run for president in 2000.
	   Lebed has denied he received any financial assistance from
Berezovsky.
	   Lebed finished a strong third in Russia's last presidential
election in 1996. Later that year he received nationwide acclaim
for his role in negotiating the end to the deeply unpopular war in
secessionist Chechnya.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 50 Kosovo Albanians have
been killed and about 200 are missing since Serbian government
forces started an offensive in the independence-minded province a
week ago, an ethnic Albanian leader said Friday.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so Kosovo Albanians who trekked into neighboring Albania
overnight reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people, said
to have died of exhaustion, and three small children. About 10,000
refugees have gathered around Tropoja in northern Albania.
	   In the reported government offensive in Kosovo, four villages
populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed, and another eight
badly damaged, said Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main party.
	   Sixteen other villages are deserted as residents fled, Cacaj
added.
	   He listed more than 50 dead and some 200 missing from the latest
offensive, concentrated around Decani, some 70 kilometers (45
miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with Montenegro.
	   Accounts such as Cacaj's are impossible to verify independently,
as both Serbian police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ fighting for independence _ block adequate access to
journalists and even humanitarian workers.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders say information comes from individuals
who manage to pass Serbian roadblocks and reach Pristina.
	   Telephone access to the area of the offensive has been cut for
days.
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro.
	   The Serb Media Center in Pristina, close to the Serbian
authorities, said meanwhile that a Yugoslav army general, Nebojsa
Pavkovic, made a surprise visit to a still-inhabited village in the
area, Batusa, inviting any Albanians who fled to return on
condition armed men turn in weapons and halt attacks on police and
army.
	   During Bosnia's 1992-95 war, such warnings were often a prelude
to a Serb attack on grounds that the community in question failed
to comply.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.
	   The clandestine KLA, which first surfaced in 1996, says the
peaceful principles of the top Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are futile.
	   A delegation picked by Rugova and officials chosen by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad
autonomy in 1989, opened a dialogue under Western pressure last
month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts. The Serbs showed up anyway for the talks,
to which Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is serving as unofficial mediator.
	   Hill noted that it is ``extremely difficult'' to get a true
picture of events around Decani.
	   ``The problem is you talk to one side, you get one view, you
talk to the other side, you get a view of 180 degrees,'' he said.
	   Rugova's aides are showing more and more sympathy for the KLA,
which only weeks ago they shunned.
	   ``Serbs systematically shell the villages in the war zone, burn
and destroy Albanian settlements,'' said Rugova's spokesman Xhemail
Mustafa. ``The Serb regime has declared and imposed war on ethnic
Albanians. Therefore, we understand the people's self-organizing on
the ground and their efforts to defend from aggression.''

Turkmen president invites Clinton to visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Turkmenistan issued an invitation
Friday to President Bill Clinton to make an official visit to
Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital, a Russian news agency reported.
	   The invitation by President Saparmurat Niyazov is to be relayed
to Clinton by his envoy to former Soviet states, Stephen
Sestanovic, who is visiting Turkmenistan, the Interfax new agency
said.
	   Niyazov met with Clinton in April during an official visit to
Washington. Despite concerns over Niyazov's human rights record,
the United States is eager to cultivate good relations with
Turkmenistan because of its strategic position on the oil-rich
Caspian Sea.
	   Sestanovic said he had given Niyazov messages from Clinton, U.S.
Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Interfax reported.
	   The envoy said he and Niyazov discussed prospects for
Turkmen-U.S. cooperation in energy and other matters.

	   MOTHERLY LOVE ... Twenty-eight-year-old sun bear Tina cuddling
her healthy newborn, Juma, at Zoo Negara yesterday.
	   Juma was named after the day and month (in Bahasa Malaysia) she
was born. She was delivered on Friday, March 27, and is the first
surviving sun bear (helarctos malayanus malayanus) cub at Zoo
Negara in 21 years.
	   Juma's birth was a pleasant surprise as her mother's pregnancy
was not known to any of the zoo keepers. There are seven sun bears
at the zoo, two males and five females.
	   Zoo keeper Ishak Bakar said it was by chance that the mother was
separated from the rest of the sun bears before she gave birth.
Cubs born in a group have little chance of survival.
	   Sun bears are solitary animals, preferring to be alone, except
for mating. In a group they often fight over territory dominance.
	   Cubs born in a group are usually eaten or stepped on by their
mother to protect them from other bears. ``One morning, I found her
cuddling her newborn. They have since remained isolated in a
cubicle,'' Ishak said.
	   Sun bears are one of the smallest of the world's eight bear
species and are affectionately known as the ``honey bears'', which
refers to their favourite food.
	   They stand less than a metre at the shoulder and weigh between
25 and 65 kilogrammes. Besides honey, they feed on carrots,
papayas, milk, sugar cane, bananas and eggs.

U.N. refugee agency says five year refugee return operation ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The last of thousands of Ethiopian refugees who
fled to nearby Sudan to escape fighting in their country are
leaving for home Friday, the U.N. refugee agency said.
	   Around 680 refugees are due to travel back to Ethiopia in
convoys organized by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva.
	   Some of the refugees have been in exile in Sudan for 20 years
after fleeing fighting which broke out between Ethiopian government
forces and Eritrean independence fighters.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.
	   The final convoys bring to an end a five-year UNHCR repatriation
program, which has helped some 71,000 Ethiopian refugees to return
to Ethiopia.
	   An additional 8,500 still in Sudan have told UNHCR they want to
stay there and are having their cases reviewed, agency spokesman
Paul Stromberg said.
	   UNHCR has also discussed with Eritrea's government the
possibility of returning some 150,000 Eritrean refugees still in
Sudan, Stromberg said. If all goes well, the return could take
place this autumn.
	   Meanwhile, another UNHCR repatriation program in Africa was
completed this week, the agency said.
	   Some 370 Tuareg refugees, described by UNHCR as ``mostly nomadic
people,'' were returned from Algeria to Niger, the last of some
4,000 who have returned after fleeing armed conflict and drought in
Niger in the early 1990s.

	   VENDORS dealing in illegal software will soon find it more
difficult to set up operations in Selangor as the State authorities
go ahead with their plan to ramp up enforcement activities.
	   Specifically, the State Consumer Affairs Department (SCA) will
start mounting operations to nab illegal software vendors and
manufacturers after June 14, said State Executive Councillor Datuk
Tang See Hang.
	   He added that the use of illegal software is still rampant, and
the State's aim is to ensure that all commercial vendors are aware
of the legal aspects of using pirated software.
	   ``Even with the Copyright Act 1997, many commercial vendors and
manufacturers still seemed to be unaware of the implications of
using illegal software,'' he said.
	   Before the enforcement drive takes place, Tan said the SCA would
first try to raise awareness on the matter through an educational
campaign in the form of a seminar.
	   The seminar aims to create awareness on the importance of using
legal software among traders, manufacturers and software
developers.
	   ``In addition to that, software developers as well as members of
the public can also learn about their rights in using legal
software from the seminar,'' Tang said.
	   The seminar, to be held in Petaling Jaya on June 14, is being
organised by the SCA, the Selangor MCA Youth High Tech Bureau and
Malaysia Cyber Youth.

Pamphlets spark Hindu-Muslim rioting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Muslims incensed by pamphlets
denigrating their religion stormed from Friday prayers to attack
Hindus, police in the southern city of Hyderabad said. Twenty-five
people were injured.
	   The mob dispersed when police fired into the air.
	   Hyderabad police chief Ram Pratap Singh said several hundred
worshippers emerged from the main weekly prayers at the city's
historic Mecca Masjid, or Mecca Mosque, protesting the pamphlet.
Some in the crowd began throwing stones at city buses carrying
Hindus, and three Hindus were stabbed, Singh said. Four shops
belonging to Hindus were burned, Singh said.
	   Pamphlets that first turned up on the streets of Hyderabad
earlier this week included a drawing of Islamic holy places under
the foot of the Hindu god Ganesh, with Hindi-language text claiming
Ganesh as the god of all. It was unclear who has been distributing
the pamphlets.
	   Hyderabad, about 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) south of New
Delhi, has a history of religious tension. Its population of nearly
4.5 million people is half Muslim, while Hindus are the
overwhelming majority elsewhere in India.

	   BUTTERWORTH, Wed. - Lack of co-operation among the various State
fisheries departments' enforcement units has been identified as the
major cause for the rampant smuggling of cockle spats from several
west coast States to a neighbouring country.
	   State Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment Committee chairman
Datuk Abdul Rashid Abdullah said today by failing to liaise with
one another, efforts to check the smuggling of the shellfish, which
have run into several million ringgit over the past few years, had
proved futile.
	   ``For example, we have found out that some State fisheries
department's enforcement units had failed to alert their
counterparts in another State when several lorry-loads of cockle
spats had left for another State enroute to its destination.
	   ``The errant units might have learnt about the attempted
smuggling of late, but they should still inform their counterparts
in other States to nab the perpetrators,'' he said without naming
the errant State fisheries departments' enforcement units.
	   Abdul Rashid was asked to comment on a memorandum submitted to
him recently by the Seberang Prai Fishermen's Association over the
rampant smuggling of cockle spats from several States in the west
coast to a neighbouring country. He said checks also showed that
the smugglers, preferring to carry out their activity by land,
travelled through special routes in Perak and Kelantan to reach
their final destination, usually Hatyai in southern Thailand.
	   ``Consumption of cockles in Thailand is very high and the people
there prefer our cockles to their home-bred shellfish.
	   ``The smugglers usually cart away several hundred gunny sacks of
cockle spats at any one time.
	   ``It is a very lucrative activity which, if left unchecked,
could adversely affect the local cockle-breeding industry,'' he
said.
	   Abdul Rashid also said lack of enforcement by the units had
contributed to the rampant encroachment of fishermen from other
States in Penang waters.

million), despite angry bursts of nationalism from small investors
who wanted to keep the luxury carmaker British.
	   Vickers PLC, the corporation that owns Rolls-Royce, announced at
the end of a stormy meeting that investors had agreed to sell
Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen, Europe's biggest automaker.
	   Proxy votes and votes from big institutional shareholders had
made the approval a done deal, but Vickers held off the
announcement until it had counted ballots from the little
shareholders who made the big noise.

U.N. refugee agency says five year refugee return operation ends
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: MOVES UP pvs 5th graf to CLARIFY that refugees in Sudan for 20
years are among the 71,000 total, not the last returnees.  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The last of thousands of Ethiopian refugees who
fled to nearby Sudan to escape fighting in their country are
leaving for home Friday, the U.N. refugee agency said.
	   Around 680 refugees are due to travel back to Ethiopia in
convoys organized by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva.
	   The final convoys bring to an end a five year UNHCR repatriation
program which has helped some 71,000 Ethiopian refugees to return
to Ethiopia.
	   Some of the refugees have been in exile in Sudan for 20 years
after fleeing fighting, which broke out between Ethiopian
government forces and Eritrean independence fighters.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.
	   An additional 8,500 still in Sudan have told UNHCR they want to
stay there and are having their cases reviewed, agency spokesman
Paul Stromberg said.
	   UNHCR has also discussed with Eritrea's government the
possibility of returning some 150,000 Eritrean refugees still in
Sudan, Stromberg said. If all goes well, the return could take
place this autumn.
	   Meanwhile, another UNHCR repatriation program in Africa was
completed this week, the agency said.
	   Some 370 Tuareg refugees, described by UNHCR as ``mostly nomadic
people,'' were returned from Algeria to Niger, the last of some
4,000 who have returned after fleeing armed conflict and drought in
Niger in the early 1990s.

	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' shareholder Rodney Crowe
asked during Vickers' special meeting.
	   ``What are we going to have? A flying lady on the front of the
Beetle?'' Crowe said later.
	   Some investors sounded like they were ready to refight World War
II in a session where they first rejected a bid of 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) from rival German automaker BMW.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers in the packed auditorium when he
referred to Volkswagen's history in Nazi Germany.
	   Volkswagen faces not just vocal objections but some real
potential hurdles at it moves to take over production of luxury
Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, which cost about dlrs 250,000 each.
	   The jilted suitor, BMW, supplies some engines to Rolls-Royce and
has threatened to cut off deliveries. BMW spokesman Uwe Mahla said
in Munich that Friday's developments were ``for us a very suprising
situation,'' and BMW sources said executives were holding an
emergency meeting.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC, a separate company that makes jet engines,
controls the brand name and logo and has made it clear it would
rather see the deal go to BMW, which happens to be its partner in a
jet engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC has not said whether it will negotiate with
Volkswagen or try to block its use of the brand name.
	   Asked about that, the Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler,
insisted that a 25-year-old contract that would let Rolls-Roye PLC
veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Ltd. by a foreign
buyer is legally unenforceable.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the Flying Lady and Bentley.''
	   But some shareholders expressed worries that the Rolls
production line could be halted by the dispute.
	   And at least one expressed disgust at the fight over a name that
epitomizes handmade British luxury.
	   ``It's harmful for Rolls-Royce PLC and it's harmful for Vickers
and they don't seem to care,'' Carol Day said. ``They're behaving
like 6-year-old children.''
	   The takeover announcement also was delayed by a Rolls-Royce
enthusiasts group, Crewe Motors, which claimed it was on the verge
of putting together a 500 million pound (dlrs 815 million) offer
from private backers.
	   Its chairman, Michael Shrimpton, who has failed to put together
previous bids, forced Vickers to adjourn the meeting for nearly one
hour, but the Vickers chairman was unconvinced and refused any
further delays.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's latest batting discovery
Mahela Jayawardena frustrated New Zealand with an unbeaten 88 as
his team overtook the touring side's first innings total of 193
Friday, the third day of the second Test at the Galle cricket
stadium.
	   The home team ended the day at 197 for 3. The 21-year old
Jayawardena occupied the crease for 177 minutes, hitting eight
fours for his third successive half century in the series.
	   Although reducing New Zealand to a low total, Sri Lanka did not
produce the best of starts. Opener Sanath Jayasuriya was back in
the pavilion in the 13th over of the innings for just 21 runs.
	   But Jayawardena and Marvan Atapattu lifted the side with a
62-run stand for the second wicket before off-spinner Paul Wiseman
broke the alliance by having the latter caught by Vettori at short
fine-leg for 36.
	   Earlier in the day off-cutter Kumara Dharmasena made inroads
into the New Zealand batting when he plucked three quick wickets in
the morning session to leave the tourists at a lunch time score of
162 for 8 from an overnight 122 for 5.
	   Bowling his first over for the day, Dharmasena had Nathan Astle
picked up by short-leg Hashan Tillekaratne for 53 and in his
following over got rid of Chris Cairns who glanced a ball into
leg-slip Sanath Jayasuriya without scoring.
	   Dharmasena then sent back Chris Harris, caught at mid-on for
four runs, and wrapped up the New Zealand innings shortly after
lunch by claiming the wickets of Adam Parore for 30 and Paul
Wiseman for 23.
	   Parore top-edged at sweep shot and was caught at fine-leg after
which fell Wiseman who was stumped while attempting a big hit.
	   Dharmasena finished with career-best figures of 6 for 72, the
best by a Sri Lankan against New Zealand.
	   More than eight hours of play has been lost in the match so far
due to wet conditions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Inland Revenue Board today launched its
new corporate logo in line with its corporatisation exercise which
took place on March 1, 1996.
	   IRB chief executive officer Najirah Mohd Tassaduk Khan said the
board's directors chose the new logo from among a few other entries
on Dec 17 last year.
	   The logo was created by IRB assessment officer Nasruddin Mat
Nasir.
	   Najirah said the triangle shaped logo showed the board's
determination to increase tax collection and quality service.
	   ``It also shows IRB as better tax managers in the region and to
be the best Government agency in the country,'' she said.
	   She said each angle of the triangle showed there was a just tax
system, which was transparent and respected by the public.
	   The three angles, she said, denoted IRB's vision, corporate
mission and corporate values of the board.
	   The blue colour of the front triangle reflects the board's
corporate status while the yellow colour in the back triangle shows
that Malaysia is a sovereign state.
	   The letters ``H'' and ``R'' in the triangle represent the word
hasil (income) and ringgit Malaysia - stating the fact that the IRB
is the biggest revenue collector for the Government.
	   The half circle from outside the triangle which crosses into it
shows that IRB is moving into the computerisation era and heading
towards Vision 2020.

Poland will not make Auschwitz memorial extraterritorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland will not consider a suggestion by a
Jewish leader to grant extraterritorial status to the memorial of
the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz, an official said Friday.
	   Krzysztof Sliwinski, a foreign ministry official for dialogue
with the Jewish Diaspora, said in a telephone interview that the
suggestion is an isolated idea that was never made or discussed
officially.
	   ``It does not mean, when a place is listed on the UNESCO list as
an historic heritage, that the sovereignty of the state can be
limited,'' Sliwinski said.
	   Kalman Sultanik, deputy head of the World Jewish Congress, said
on Polish private Radio Plus Thursday that ``a way must be found to
make Auschwitz extraterritorial.''
	   He said that local authorities do ``not always remember what
Auschwitz means to the Jews. Auschwitz is the symbol of Shoah and
the Holocaust.''
	   Some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died in the camp's gas
chambers or from hunger, disease and forced labor there between
1940-45.
	   Jewish protests have led to the removal of a convent from the
museum's neighborhood and to changing plans to build a mini mall
across from the museum to a visitors' center. Jewish leaders
continue to protest the presence of a tall cross in the former
camp's vicinity.
	   A special committee of Jewish leaders, Auschwitz survivors,
historians and Polish officials was formed three years ago to
advise on decisions concerning the museum's future.

	   ONE uses mercury to measure the temperature. Thais rely on eggs
to gauge the state of the economy, or more precisely the parity
between their pocketbooks and price levels.
	   The public went up in arms when the price of an egg rose beyond
the Bt1-mark -- the first time in the country's history -- during
the Kriangsak Chamanan administration in 1977-1980.
	   A little over a decade later, former prime minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh was called a feeble leader when egg prices rose beyond
Bt2.
	   Now, after spending barely seven months in office, Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai probably wishes to trade places with an egg
since he's in the frying pan already. In the last month egg prices
leapt from Bt3 to a record high of Bt5 for the largest egg.
	   ''Eggs are off the menu now; prices are not only high, they are
unbelievable,'' commented a food vendor in Praves market.
	   However, to be only fair, there are cheaper eggs than the Bt5
variety. Smaller eggs, size one to five could cost between Bt2.3
and Bt3. A mid-size egg, the most popular, would be slightly over
Bt3 while the smallest one is most sought after due to its low
price.
	   Even though consumers choose sizes to match their budget they
sometimes have to do without because the smaller eggs are often out
of supply.
	   Chachoengsao Chicken Cooperatives' president Manoch Chutaptim
reasoned that the sudden jump in prices had probably been triggered
by the 40-per cent rise in the cost for chicken feed and this
year's severe dry season which stopped hens from laying eggs.
	   A worker wryly posed the question of what the underprivileged
should eat. ''Pla Thu and egg used to be the favourite food for the
poor. The fish got out of reach years ago. Now eggs are becoming
expensive,'' she said.

	   MORE than 40,000 people rallied in driving rain to commemorate
the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown for the
first time under Chinese rule.
	   The turnout at the candlelight vigil was smaller than last
year's 55,000 but organisers said it was the spirit and not the
numbers that mattered.
	   Torrential rain was blamed by organisers for the smaller crowd.
	   The annual vigil, at which exiled Chinese dissidents Wang Dan
and Wei Jingsheng appealed to Hong Kong to continue the fight for
democracy in the mainland, started under an amber rainstorm signal
and a thunderstorm warning.
	   The rainstorm forced the organisers _ the Hong Kong Alliance in
Support of Patriotic Democratic Movement in China _ to cut the
vigil back to just over one hour.
	   The Democratic Party's Szeto Wah, who heads the alliance, said:
``This (crowd) shows Hong Kong people's consistency in supporting
the June 4 (memorial).
	   ``It proves that there is a wish for democracy.'' Sitting under
umbrellas, the demonstrators sang along with pro-democracy
legislators Mr Szeto, Andrew Cheng Kar-foo, Lee Cheuk-yan, Lee
Wing-tat, Albert Ho Chun-yan and Lau Chin-shek, to mourn those
killed in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
	   Under a banner that read ``Vindication of June 4'', the crowd
lit candles after university students from the Hong Kong Federation
of Students lit a flame.
	   The vigil started after a giant wreath was presented in front of
a stage to remember those killed.
	   Wreaths were also placed under the ``Pillar of Shame''.
	   In Victoria Park, prominent dissidents Mr Wang and Mr Wei, who
were freed by Beijing on medical parole, addressed the crowd via
telephone link from the US.
	   Speaking from New York Mr Wang said the vigil meant a lot to the
democracy movement in China and wished he could be there. ``Within
China, only people in Hong Kong can enjoy freedom and democracy. It
is very important that Hong Kong people keep this up,'' he said.
	   Mr Wei said: ``Now Hong Kong is part of China, the democratic
movement of Hong Kong determines the future of China. If people in
Hong Kong protect their democracy, it will set an example to the
whole of China.'' Democratic Party leader Martin Lee Chu-ming said
the rain had never dampened the people's faith in democracy. ``It
does not matter that it is raining. The quest for democracy in Hong
Kong was born in the rain,'' he said.
	   In Japan, visiting Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan
Fang On-sang said the vigil proved the government was determined to
maintain the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people. ``There has
been no attempt whatsoever on the part of leaders in Beijing to
interfere in any way in the exercise of these rights and
freedoms,'' Mrs Chan said.
	   In the US, Chinese dissidents and US legislators marked the
event by urging President Clinton to avoid Tiananmen Square during
his upcoming visit to China.

	   MR A, who received a master's degree in finance from a famous
university in the United States, was fired last year when the
finance and securities company he worked for was shut down.
	   After receiving a salary of Bt45,000 a month from the company,
Mr A, a former investment banker, now earns only Bt7,700 per month
from a state agency. Mr A would certainly be unable to command the
same high salary if he still worked for the private company due to
the bearish stock market sentiment which has caused reductions in
the securities companies' brokerage fees and other income.
	   According to a recent report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the 22 finance and securities companies' annual
overhead was Bt429,908 for each of the 7,051 employees. Meanwhile,
21 securities companies' annual overhead was Bt588,564 for each of
3,689 employees, or Bt49,047 a month.
	   Data released by the report indicated operators of the
securities businesses are in deep trouble.
	   Revenue of all finance and securities companies dropped sharply
from 1996 levels. In 1996, they earned a total of Bt51.3 billion,
while last year the 25 companies earned only Bt12.3 billion, a 76
per cent drop. The revenue generated by the suspended companies was
negative Bt7 billion, mainly because of the shorter interest
accrual period and investment losses.
	   Securities companies' revenue also dropped sharply from Bt4.8
billion a year earlier to minus Bt6.124 billion last year due to
lower broking fees, fee-based income, as well as net interest and
dividend income and investment losses.
	   Last year, operating securities companies earned only Bt11.6
billion in net interest and dividend income while the suspended
companies' was minus Bt7.3 billion. In 1996, their interest and
dividend income reached Bt39 billion.
	   Their broking fees were only Bt7.4 billion -- Bt5.6 billion
generated by still-operating companies and Bt1.8 billion by the
suspended companies. In 1996, broking fees were Bt11.1 billion.
	   Of the 43 operating companies, there were only nine whose
broking fees were between Bt200 and Bt550 million, while the other
34 companies recorded broking fees below Bt200 million.
	   The fee-based income of the 43 companies was only Bt1.5 billion,
compared to Bt5.1 billion a year earlier.
	   Their investments also generated much less revenue. The 23
finance and securities companies had an outstanding investment
value in the stock market of Bt41 billion at the end of last year.
They recorded a loss of Bt6 billion.Securities companies performed
much more poorly. While their outstanding investment in the
corresponding period was Bt17 billion, their investment churned out
Bt11.8 billion in losses.
	   No one in the securities business dares say when the black cloud
hovering over the industry will disappear. What they fear most is
their deteriorating conditions, which could make them attractive
targets for foreign investors.
	   If he had remained in the closed company, Mr A might have
benefitted from his fluent English but he would not be able to
command the same salary he once received.

	   APPLE Computer is ready to regain its footing in the consumer
market space, with the forthcoming launch of several new products
targeted for users in that particular market segment.
	   Its South Asia Pte Ltd's general manager Chng Poh Hwa said the
company has over the last 12 months been streamlining its product
line to better suit the needs of the consumer market while at the
same time, continuing its focus on the professional market.
	   ``The key point is for us to get the product strategy right and
make products that people want. The next step is how to get the
message across.
	   We are today a lot more focused and direct, and plan to roll
this message out with more consistency while ensuring that our
supply and distribution chains are effective,'' Chng told
Computimes in Singapore last week.
	   The company's current focus is to have a product line -
comprising a desktop and a mobile - each for the consumer and the
professional market.
	   ``We want to reach out to consumers, knowing that cost is no
longer the issue - it never really is, actually. The real issue is
value,'' said Chng.
	   One of Apple's key new products is the iMac consumer desktop
computer, which Chng believes will make consumers want to switch
from the personal computer (PC) platform to the Macintosh.
	   ``We've received comments that the iMac is tomorrow's technology
at today's prices and that's true - it's not repackaging technology
in a more exciting shape. There has been no compromise in the
performance, and the shape and the set-up are really exciting,'' he
said.
	   The iMac - short for Internet Mac - is Apple's bid to recapture
consumer market share and is seen by Apple as combining ``the
excitement of the Internet and the simplicity of the Mac'', said
Chng.
	   Featuring a 15-inch monitor, a translucent blue-and-white
casing, easy Internet access and Apple's PowerPC G3 processor, the
iMac is expected to be available in stores in the US in August and
in South Asia around that time-frame as well, he said.
	   Earlier, Apple Computer South Asia launched its latest product
for the mobile market - the PowerBook G3 series of notebook
computers.

Taxi fares in Tokyo high by international standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When you have the chance to take a cab in Tokyo,
check your wallet first. A new survey shows Japan's taxis are the
priciest in the industrialized world.
	   The Transport Ministry compared fares in Japan in October with
those in Britain, France, Germany and the United States _ and found
Japan's taxis sometimes charge twice as much, a news report said.
	   Against a base figure of 100 for Japan, daytime taxi fares over
a distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles) stood at 59 in the United
States, 72 in Germany, 73 in Britain _ and less than half at 45 in
France, Kyodo News reported.
	   A majority of taxi drivers in France, Germany and the United
States are immigrants or part-time workers receiving low wages,
contributing to lower fares, the ministry said.
	   But the subways in Japan are a steal _ compared to some
countries. The ministry reported subway fares came to 86 in Paris,
96 in New York, 123 in Frankfurt and 156 in London against 100 for
Tokyo.
	   Taxi fares, however, are getting cheaper for international
travelers, thanks to the depreciation of the yen against the U.S.
dollar.
	   The ministry's fare comparisons were made at an exchange rate of
121 yen to the dollar, which on Friday bought 139 yen _ meaning a
1,000-yen fare that cost dlrs 8.25 in October is now only dlrs
7.19.

	   TWELVE mega-projects which have a potential of generating 53,000
jobs cannot be brought forward despite high unemployment, according
to Secretary for Works Kwong Hon-sang.
	   He made his comments as he unveiled five projects to be
accelerated by at least two to five months to create an additional
531 jobs late this year.
	   ``Accelerating major infrastructure projects is not always
possible because some key activities do take time, such as
authorisation of works under statutory requirements, thorough
investigation and design works,'' Mr Kwong said.
	   Among the mega-projects which will not be advanced are Kowloon
Canton Railway's West Rail Phase 1 and Ma On Shan Line, Mass
Transit Railway Tseung Kwan O Extension, Route 10 from North Lantau
to Yuen Long, and Route 9 from Tsing Yi and Cheung Sha Wan.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen pledged on
Wednesday to advance public works projects as part of the 12-point
package to solve unemployment.
	   The package which will generate 100,000 jobs in the next 18
months was criticised by trade unionists and academics because it
will have a small effect on reducing unemployment.
	   Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang said
in Tokyo that the government was concerned over the steady increase
in unemployment.
	   Mr Kwong was worried that the construction industry could suffer
from a labour shortage if the major infrastructure projects are
accelerated at the same time.
	   ``We learned that developers may have a problem if these major
projects are advanced,'' he said.
	   Mr Kwong guaranteed that there would be more infrastructure
projects within the next few years after the completion of new
airport projects. ``Hong Kong will not come to a standstill in 20
months,'' Mr Kwong said.
	   ``I can assure you that there will be more infrastructure
projects within the next five to 10 years.'' Independent
legislator-elect Raymond Ho Chung-tai was disappointed with the
government's decision not to accelerate some major infrastructure
projects.
	   ``Infrastructure projects should be speeded up in preparation
for the increase in population,'' he said.
	   Head of the department of economics at Lingnan College Ho
Lok-sang said accelerating projects would not really solve
unemployment.
	   ``You are just advancing the creation of jobs but it will not
have an effect on the jobs available in the long term,'' he said.

	   HONG Kong share prices gained 2.6 per cent yesterday amid easier
interbank rates and the appreciation of the Japanese yen from
seven-year lows, dealers said.
	   ``The sentiment was lifted by the easing of interbank rates with
the strengthening of the Japanese yen,'' said Sean Li, associate
director of Amsteel Securities.
	   The benchmark three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate was
quoted at 8.375 per cent, down from the morning fix of 8.67857 per
cent.
	   The key Hang Seng index gained 221.05 points to close at
8,819.22 after two sessions of losses.
	   The value of turnover amounted to 5.724 billion Hong Kong
dollars (RM2.88 billion) against the previous day's 5.52 billion
dollars.
	   Despite the gains yesterday, dealers cautioned that overall
sentiment remained negative, given wider concerns about the local
and regional economies.
	   Dealers said the rally was driven by short-term trading and
overseas funds were still seen trimming their exposure to the local
market.

	   THE drop in domestic car sales has caused Swedish Motors
Corporation Plc (SMC), distributor of Volvo, to adopt a downsizing
policy which includes closing down five of its eight service
centres in Bangkok and 27 nationwide.
	   Geoffrey Rowe, SMC's senior executive vice president, said the
economic downturn had forced the company to concentrate more on
customer satisfaction.
	   After it experienced a 70 per cent year-on-year slowdown in
sales last September, Auto Technic (Thailand) Co, distributor of
Saab, closed down all but one showroom and service centre in the
country.
	   Rowe said SMC's restructuring would not only help increase its
sales by 10 per cent per annum but would also keep it on track to
become a market leader in the European car segment in the
millennium.
	   Volvo has currently captured around 25 per cent of the market.
However, to hold the first rank SMC would have to outdo Mercedes
Benz's coverage of 30 per cent.
	   Although, the closure of SMC's service centres has helped reduce
costs by Bt10 million per month it has not helped stimulate sales.
	   To compensate SMC has shifted its focus on improvement of
services and efficiency, particularly in the area of workshop
planning and a reduction in repeat repair jobs.
	   SMC has also adopted a pricing policy to bring its component
prices down to the same level as its competitors. In addition, it
has increased its stocks by ordering parts worth Bt60 million in a
bid to offer quick service.
	   Its stock at present, worth Bt185 million, is only able to cover
85 per cent of SMC's capacity. The company plans to raise its
capacity to 93 per cent in the near future, which would increase
the value of its stocks to around Bt200 to Bt210 million.
	   SMC also plans to become a one-stop-shop by providing products
like engine oil, brake oil, car wax, shampoo and carpeting.
	   Under the new structure SMC expects to generate sales of 1,200
units this year, a 70 per cent drop when compared to last year's
sale of 2.843 units.
	   ''Although we recorded the sales of this year's first five
months at 334 units, we believe we will be able to reach the sales
target this year since new products would surge our revenue,'' said
Rowe.
	   In the fourth quarter of this year SMC also plans to launch the
S40 and the V40 models.
	   The sale of European cars is expected to drop to 3,000 units
this year against last year's 5,000 units. Volvo's monthly sales
have fallen to around 10 units per showroom compared to around 30
to 40 units last year.

	   JAPANESE share prices closed 1.3 per cent lower yesterday, as
sellers locked in profits on the previous day's gains, brokers
said.
	   ``Although share prices rallied back yesterday thanks to active
buying support from public funds, these funds took profits today at
above 15,500 points on the Nikkei 225 index,'' a Kaisei Securities
broker said.
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stocks Exchange lost 207.45 points to end at 15,347.00.
	   Buyers retreated to the sidelines due to continued poor investor
sentiment, but share prices closed off their lows on selective
bargain- hunting, brokers said.
	   ``Bargain-hunting was very active at below 15,300 points'' on
the Nikkei 225 index, a broker said.
	   ``Buying was seen in the broader market, but with no leading
sectors and stocks to pull share prices back up sharply,'' the
broker said.
	   Investors remain cautious about active buying due to sustained
concerns about another setback on Asian markets as well as worries
over the bullish Wall Street, brokers said.
	   ``Market participants are still concerned about Asian financial
markets, including the Hong Kong share market, and prospects for
share prices in New York,'' the Kaisei Securities broker said.
	   ``The Hang Seng index has already fallen to near its lows for
the year, and may fall to new lows,'' although share prices in Hong
Kong were firm on the day.

	   THE Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday charged
Thai Modern Plastic Industry Plc (TM) with falsifying its 1997
financial statement.
	   A statement released by the watchdog said the company doctored
the amount of its outstanding loans in its annual financial
statement for the fiscal year ending Dec 31, 1997.
	   The charge has already been reported to inspectors of the
Economic Crime Suppression Unit for further investigation, the
statement noted.
	   The SEC found the actual amount of outstanding loans extended by
31 banks and financial institutions stood at Bt4.7 billion.
However, the audited financial statement reported only Bt2.2
billion.
	   Company executives could not be reached for comment.
	   ''We are not ready to give any details right now. The
investigation process is now ongoing,'' a public relations officer
said.
	   Auditors of the company will also be investigated. According to
a filing to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, TM's financial
statement was audited by Dr Virat Apimateethamrong whose licence
number is 1378.
	   Trading was suspended in TM shares on Thursday. Its latest share
price was Bt1.50.
	   The SEC has also informed the SET of the matter in order that
the information be disclosed to investors.
	   TM is a manufacturer and distributor of plastic products,
including plastic film and sheets, containers, foam flooring,
cushion material and fibreglass insect screens. The company's
paid-up capital is Bt450 million.
	   The Pannamaneechot family is a major shareholder in the company
with its 36 per cent stake. Other shareholders include Thailand
Securities Depository Co Ltd for foreign and local depositors.

	   TECHNOLOGY stocks recovered partially from yesterday's bruising
selloff, but the broad market yesterday again failed to hold most
of their gains as mounting worries about company profits prevailed.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.13 points - or 0.35 per
cent - to 8,891.24 after sliding from an early 54-point gain to a
50-point loss.
	   Broad-market indicators were mixed, with the technology-laden
Nasdaq composite index wiping out about half of Monday's 32-point
plunge.
	   The market has repeatedly failed to build any momentum over the
past month amid growing doubts about whether this year's jump in
stock prices will prove unrealistic with the economic crisis in
Asia eating away at company profits.
	   Several of the Nasdaq technology bellwethers repaired a chunk of
previous day's heavy damage, which came amid the renewed concern
about the group's considerable exposure to Asia and news of a delay
in a key Intel computer chip.
	   Even with yesterday's gain, the Nasdaq composite sits more than
150 points, or eight per cent below the closing record of 1,917.61
set on April 22.
	   There was little reaction to two reports pointing to continued
resilience in the domestic economy despite the Asian drag.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,460 up, 1,503 down and 567
unchanged. Decliners led by a 6-to-5 margin in Nasdaq trading.
	   NYSE volume totaled a brisk 589.21 million shares as of 4 p.m.,
up sharply from 536.57 million on Monday.

Four tortured bodies found in southern port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The bound and tortured bodies of four
men were found Friday in the violent eastern district of Pakistan's
largest city, which has been dominated by an ongoing feud between
rival factions of an ethnic group, police said.
	   Police believe the deaths were linked to the feud in Karachi,
where 30 people have been killed in the past one month, police
said.
	   Two of the victims found Friday belonged to the smaller Haqiqi
faction of the Mohajir Qami Movement, which represents Muslims who
came to Pakistan when it was created from a larger India in 1947 by
the departing British. The other two bodies have not been
identified.
	   The Movement split several years ago. The larger faction is led
by Altaf Hussein, who lives in self-imposed exile in Britain.
	   The government is trying to negotiate with the two factions to
try to curb the violence, officials in Karachi said. Other
government officials have gone to Britain to meet Hussein to ask
him to rein in his activists.
	   The violence accelerated in April after a bloody night of
fighting killed 21 people, many of them Hussein activists.
	   Since then, activists from both factions have been kidnapped,
their bodies found days or hours later often badly mutilated, said
police.
	   The latest round of killings is the bloodiest since Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League won elections in
February 1997.
	   Both factions are adamantly opposed to former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto. Many people hoped Sharif would have been able to
curb the violence.

Private farmers call for government support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Independent farmers picketed outside the main
government building Friday, demanding long-promised loans to help
start private businesses in a country where most land is still
farmed collectively.
	   ``Russian farmers have lost patience,'' the Russian Farmers
Union said in a statement. ``For three years, farmers have been
denied the credits allotted to them in the budget.''
	   Farmers' representatives later met with deputy prime minister
Boris Nemtsov who promised to extend 700 million rubles (dlrs 113
million) in credits to the private farmers.
	   Private farms are still rare in Russia, and they are struggling
for survival.
	   While criticizing the government for failing to come through
with promised loans, the farmers praised President Boris Yeltsin
for vetoing a restrictive land bill passed by the parliament.
	   The issue of land ownership in Russia remains highly
controversial. Since the Soviet breakup, Russians have been
permitted to own land in urban areas, but most agricultural plots
remain state property and are farmed collectively as in Soviet
times.
	   Yeltsin considers land privatization to be essential for
Russia's economic growth, but Communists and other hard-liners in
parliament have balked at allowing the free sale of land. They
argue that would allow foreigners and rich Russians to buy huge
tracts of land and take them out of agriculture use.
	   The bill, drafted by Communists and other hard-liners, prohibits
most real estate deals, including inheritance, grants and other
forms of transferring ownership.
	   Yeltsin's veto of the law can be overridden by a two-thirds
majority in both houses of parliament.

	   IMPORTANT RITUAL ... Rice as staple food is important for the
Dusun Lotud and in their religious ceremonies.
	   The Lotud believe that rice is crucial to the physical and
spiritual well being of the community.
	   Seen here is Odun Rinduman, 75 (standing), leading a rice ritual
during the Harvest Festival celebration held at the Kadazandusun
Cultural Association building in Penampang, Sabah.
	   The community, which hails from Tuaran, 30km north of Kota
Kinabalu, believe that padi is deprived of its spirit in the course
of harvesting.
	   The rice ceremony (Monumbui) is then conducted to restore the
padi's spirit.
	   The ritual is conducted by two or more Tantagas (female ritual
specialists) who perform such rites.
	   The Lotud believe when more rice is produced, it reflects the
future well being and prosperity of the padi field owners.

	   FOREIGN Minister Surin Pitsuwan will hand over ''aide memoirs''
to Bangkok-based ambassadors of India and Pakistan when he meets
them on Friday to express Thailand's deep concern over their series
of nuclear tests last month, a government source said on Thursday.
	   The source said that Surin is scheduled to have separate
meetings with the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors on Friday and
they are expected to discuss both countries' nuclear tests, which
drew outrage from the international community.
	   ''The aide memoirs are to reflect Thailand's deep concern
regarding the tests as they have badly affected the security of
South Asia and the region as a whole,'' the source said.
	   The nuclear tests have led to economic sanctions on India and
Pakistan by major donors including the United States and Japan.
	   Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the
nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan in retaliation for India's
nuclear tests are likely to affect the country's application for
membership of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF).
	   ''Senior Asean foreign ministry officials, meeting in Moscow,
discussed how to deal with Pakistan's application for membership of
the ARF following the country's nuclear tests,'' Kobsak said.
Bangkok was represented by permanent foreign secretary Saroj
Chavanaviraj.
	   However, it they have not yet reached a common stand on the
issue, pending discussion with other ARF members, including Asean's
dialogue partners and consultative partners -- China, the US,
Russia and Germany.
	   Asked about Asean's reaction to the tests, Kobsak said the
grouping would wait for the conclusion of a meeting between eight
economic powers in London.
	   He added that before the nuclear tests by Pakistan, Asean seemed
ready to fully welcome Pakistan into the ARF, but following the
incidents Asean has to reconsider its position.
	   Meanwhile, when Asean's leaders meet at a summit in Vietnam
later this year they will determine a ''Hanoi Plan of Action'' to
outline the cooperation needed to achieve ''Asean Vision 2000'',
Kobsak said.
	   The Hanoi Plan of Action will comprise cooperation in various
fields, including sustainable development, personnel development,
Mekong River basin development and economic integration.
	   To be discussed among Asean leaders at the summit, to be held on
Dec 15 and 16, is a ''Hanoi Summit Declaration'', which will be the
grouping's reaction to recent incidents that have taken place in
Southeast Asia and the world.
	   Kobsak said the Hanoi Summit will be the last of its kind before
2000.

Two Thai police officers taken hostage by armed drug dealers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANG VUOA, Thailand (AP) _ More than 100 armed police officers
took up positions Friday at a village where two undercover
narcotics officers were being held hostage by suspected drug
dealers.
	   The hostage-takers, who unmasked the undercover men Thursday
during an amphetamine deal gone wrong, were armed and demanding 3
million baht (dlrs 75,000) ransom, police said.
	   The messenger who carried the ransom demand said that the five
ethnic Hmong tribesmen who took the officers hostage had beaten the
captives, who were said to be in bad condition.
	   The captors confiscated the guns and pickup truck of the
undercover officers and drove them to a hill near Pang Vuoa, some
370 kilometers (230 miles) northwest of Bangkok.
	   Police said they believed they knew the exact whereabouts of the
men, who are in an extremely rugged area, but were holding off on a
raid, hoping to defuse the situation peacefully.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Government has responded to the
people's protests and rescinded the higher toll rate proposed for
the Kuala Lumpur-Karak highway, Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy
Vellu said.
	   He said the Cabinet today agreed to a new rate which is lower by
between 25 and 30 per cent and which will be implemented on Friday.
	   ``The decision was reached after considering the complaints
received from the public, in particular from Members of Parliament
such as Datuk Lim Ah Lek from Bentong and Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik
from Temerloh.''
	   Samy Vellu, who was speaking to reporters after a post-Cabinet
meeting at his office today, said the Government had also taken
into account the fact that most of the areas along the highway have
yet to be developed.
	   The new toll rates for Gombak toll plaza are RM3 for Class I
vehicles, RM6 for Class II, RM9 for Class III, RM1.50 for Class IV
and RM3 for Class V. The original proposed rates for the respective
classes was RM4.20, RM8.40, RM12.60, RM2.10 and RM4.20.
	   The new toll rate for the Bentong toll plaza are, RM1.90 for
Class I, RM3.80 for Class II, RM5.70 for Class III, RM1 for Class
IV and RM1.90 for Class V. The original proposed rates for the
respective classes was RM2.40, RM4.80, RM7.20, RM1.20 and RM2.40.
	   Class I is for cars, Class II for vehicles with up to six tyres
and two axles, Class III for those with more than six tyres and
three axles, Class IV for taxis and Class V for buses.
	   Samy Vellu said the Government will spend RM14 million annually
to compensate for the losses incurred by the highway
concessionaire, MTD Prime Sdn Bhd, due to the reduction in the toll
rates.
	   He described the new toll rates as reasonable.
	   ``This is not an old road because we spent millions to build a
multi- level interchange for the highway at Bukit Tinggi, new
tunnels and extra lanes such as six lanes along the Gombak-Genting
stretch.''
	   He said the new rate, which stands at nine sen per kilometre,
was the lowest compared to the North-South Expressway which costs
motorist 10.5 sen per km.
	   Samy Vellu said the 27-year concession period remained.

	   THE ROYAL Forestry Department (RFD) recently rejected the
Zoological Park Organisation plan to send 12 female elephants to
China in exchange for the country's indigenous species after
opposition by elephant lovers, a department source said.
	   ''The RFD rejected the proposal because there were many things
that were not transparent. Why is the park organisation willing to
send only female elephants,'' asked the source from the Asean
Elephant Foundation of Thailand.
	   The source, who asked not to be named, said in the past the
organisation has sent many female elephants to China and Japan and
all reproduced in their new environment.''It was reported that they
were already impregnated before being sent. Therefore, it was
suspected that involved officials might have been granted tangible
benefits because the receiving countries gained both the female
elephants and their calves,'' the source said.
	   The organisation wants to exchange the 12 female elephants for
two pairs of red pandas, a yak and a couple of snow leopards from
China.
	   Zoological Park Organisation director general Usum
Nimmanahaeminda, who initiated the proposal, was not available for
comment on Thursday.
	   According to the department source, state officials and private
sector interests involved have operated an illegal elephant trade
for more than a decade.
	   He said they use a loophole in the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) which states that elephants can
only be transferred to another country on a non-profit basis and
under an agreement made on a government-to-government basis. Under
Cites, trade in elephants is absolutely prohibited.
	   Well-trained Thai elephants are in demand on the international
market, where a single animal can be worth Bt1 million or higher.
	   Meanwhile, five out of six elephants sent to Indonesia in
October have been abandoned there without their mahouts, who
returned to Thailand on Wednesday after facing difficulties.
	   Suriya Ruampattana, one of the elephant's owners said, ''I want
the elephants to be brought back. I'm afraid they will [all] die'',
adding that one elephant was already dead.
	   Suriya said that the Zoological Park Organisation, the RFD and
Asian Elephant Foundation of Thailand veterinarian Pakorn Ngomanee,
who asked him to send the elephants to Indonesia, should take
responsibility for bringing home the remaining five elephants.
	   Pakorn, however, argued that he was not involved in sending the
elephants.
	   ''It is true that I went to Surin province together with
organisation director general Usum and RFD deputy director general
Wattana Kaewkhamnerd before the sending of the elephants, but my
duty was only to check their condition.
	   ''I even recommended against sending the elephants to Indonesia
because of the rush and lack of necessary information concerning
their use. I don't know why the organisation still sent them,'' he
said.

	   PHILIPPINES President-elect Joseph Estrada would be glad to know
that he is an inspiration for at least one ambitious Thai
politician -- New Aspiration Party deputy leader Chingchai
Mongkholtham.
	   Chingchai, who always makes his political ambitions public,
declared recently that he would become party leader and
subsequently prime minister in five to seven years.
	   ''The success of Estrada has inspired me to become the country's
leader. He stands by the poor, and so do I,'' he said.
	   Although some candidates in the recent presidential elections
were highly-educated, most Filipinos chose Estrada, he noted.
	   Chingchai, formerly a primary school teacher, said that if he
became premier, he would use local wisdom to guide his
administration's national development efforts.
	   ''Why did our country fail? It's because we have followed
western countries all along,'' he said.
	   CHOKCHAI Farm owner Chokchai Bulkul is probably the country's
biggest collector. His collections of various kinds of priceless
items would definitely make fledging collectors green with envy.
	   Inside his four-storey museum, he stores several vintage cars,
including Peugeots, Rolls-Royces and Mercedes Benzes. He has a
Mercedes SL190 formerly belonging to Luang Phibunsongkram,
Thailand's fourth prime minister.
	   Apart from cars, he has some antique record players, a huge
collection of ceramic handicrafts. He is also an avid collector of
guns, with more than 500 in his possession.
	   ''I began collecting guns when I was 20. One of them previously
belonged to the late former prime minister Gen Chatichai
Choonhavan''.
	   As a cowboy enthusiast, he has a number of stuffed wild beasts
and their horns but insists he has never shot any animal.
	   ''I have never done that [killing animals]. You know why? I'm
grateful to them. I have come this far largely because of them,''
said the dairy farm owner.

Nippon Ham climb into first place with 5-4 win over Lotte
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Nippon Ham Fighters edged the Chiba Lotte
Marines 5-4 Friday night at Tokyo Dome to climb into first place in
the Pacific League standings.
	   Trailing by two runs in the seventh inning, veteran slugger
Hiromitsu Ochiai hit a bases-loaded double to tie the game. The
Fighters added three more runs in the inning to take the lead.
	   In Fukuoka, Akira Okamoto tossed a three-hitter to lead the
Kintetsu Buffaloes to a 6-0 win over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, who
slipped to second place with the loss.
	   Kintetsu infielder Phil Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox,
batted in two runs in the sixth to open the scoring for the
Buffaloes.
	   Seibu Lions slugger Brian Raabe smashed a solo homerun in the
third and Domingo Martinez batted in two runs in the eighth as the
Lions beat the last-place Orix Bluewave 4-2 at Seibu Dome.
	   Raabe played formerly with Colorado Rockies and Martinez played
with Triple-A Rochester.
	   In the Central League, Yomiuri Giants pitcher Hiromi Makihara
gave up no runs over eight-plus innings as the Giants blanked the
Chunichi Dragons 1-0 at Nagoya Dome.
	   Hiroo Ishii batted in the Giants' only run in the first off a
sacrifice fly.
	   With the win, Yomiuri climbed into second place, while the
Dragons slipped to third.
	   No other Central League games were scheduled for Friday.

	   HONG KONG people should take heart at the opportunity to voice
their feelings over the June 4 crackdown on Chinese soil, many who
attended last night's vigil said.
	   They also said the Tiananmen Square crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement was ``very wrong''.
	   Chung Ching-kei, 46, who has participated in the vigil since
1990, said it was special this year.
	   ``This is the first time such a large scale vigil commemorating
June 4 has been held within China.
	   ``It bears special meaning which shows democracy is possible for
the mainland,'' he said.
	   Mr Chung was delighted to see the SAR government being tolerant
towards the vigil at Victoria Park.
	   ``I thought this activity would not be allowed and the Alliance
for the Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China would be
forced to disband,'' he said.
	   This view was shared by Li Kwok-kin, 23, who said he had thought
last year's vigil would be the last.
	   ``The most important thing is that Beijing has to admit the 1989
crackdown was wrong,'' Mr Li said.
	   He was disappointed by the result of a survey that indicated
more people had a neutral attitude towards the event.
	   A 33-year-old female clerk, said the vigil on Chinese soil
indicated it was impossible for Beijing to suppress people's
freedom of expression.
	   Another female participant, aged 45, said Hong Kong people
should treasure this opportunity to express their anger over the
crackdown.
	   Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Student's Union
issued a statement calling on the Central Government to admit it
was wrong in ordering the crackdown and to investigate who should
be held responsible for the tragedy.
	   They also urged the mainland to end the ``single party rule''.
	   Students keep memories alive with giant torchesLED by two
torches held aloft, about 80 college students joined thousands of
others at the June 4 memorial vigil last night to keep the fire of
the 1989 democratic movement ablaze.
	   Organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, participants
from eight higher-education institutions set off from the
University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in
two groups at 5 pm. They merged at Queen's Pier in Central at 6.30
pm.
	   The students arrived in Victoria Park at 8 pm.
	   The two torches, symbolising the spirit of democracy and liberty
pursued by the student movement, hovered in the air throughout the
night as the students passed them round.
	   University of Hong Kong social work student Peter Tang, 24, said
he joined the rally because he wanted to make mainland officials
aware that people believed the crackdown was a crime.
	   ``The students might have made mistakes, but those were only
strategic mistakes.
	   ``But what the government did were moral mistakes.'' Copyright

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Indah Water Konsortium is likely to reduce
its commercial charges by between 30 and 40 per cent while its
28-year concession period to upgrade the sewerage system nationwide
may be extended for at least another 10 years.
	   Department of Sewerage Service director-general Lum Weng Kee
told the New Straits Times the move was to placate disgruntled
consumers while at the same time ensure the business of providing
sewerage service was still economically viable for IWK.
	   ``These are among the proposals submitted to the Economic
Planning Unit following the Government's directive to IWK to review
its commercial charges two months ago.''
	   This will be the second review of IWK rates since it took over
the sewerage service from the local authorities in December 1993.
	   While declining to reveal the exact percentage cut for the
commercial sector, Lum said it would be between 30 and 40 per cent
and not 50 per cent as previously reported.
	   The reduction was reached after taking into account the costs
needed to maintain and upgrade the sewerage plants IWK inherited
from the 144 local authorities, he said.
	   Under IWK's 1997 charges, commercial customers pay their monthly
sewerage bills based on their property value and the amount of
water consumed, which could range between RM10 and RM15,000.
	   Industrial customers, on the other hand, pay according to the
number of employees. Premises with individual septic tank services,
for instance, pay RM2 per head per month.
	   For residential customers, the monthly rates are between RM2 and
RM8, depending on type of houses.
	   Lum also disclosed that the 1993 Sewerage Services Act would be
amended to empower water authorities to disconnect water supply of
customers who fail to settle their sewerage bills.
	   Assessing the situation, Lum felt that IWK's commercial
customers had no grounds to complain about the previous charges.
	   ``We did an analysis comparing IWK's 1994 and 1997 charges and
found the amount incurred by its customers to be insignificant.''
	   In the department's survey involving hotels, coffeeshops,
restaurants, laundries, petrol stations, government offices, office
building and shopping complexes, it was found that the increase was
negligible.
	   Coffeeshop owners, for instance, paid an average of RM0.02 per
customer per day under the 1997 charges and RM0.08 under the 1994
rates. The difference of RM0.06, said Lum, was negligible.
	   For large hotels, the difference was only RM0.70, restaurants
(RM0.02), laundries (RM0.35), petrol stations (RM0.005), government
offices (RM0.001), office buildings (RM0.007) and shopping
complexes (RM0.062) Initially, IWK was to take over only 1,800
sewerage plants. But due to local authorities' poor data
collection, IWK is now faced with the task of refurbishing 5,300
plants and another 2,700 by the year 2002 at the cost of RM1.5
billion.
	   More than 70 per cent of them are malfunctioning, hence, the
inability to meet the Department of Environment's standards for
waste water discharge.
	   Another sum of RM17 billion is needed to build new treatment
plants in Penang, Langkawi, Labuan and Kuala Lumpur, add new sewer
lines, improve existing sewerage system and increase manpower.
	   All in, IWK is serving 11 million users.

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ As Eritrea vowed that it would never give
in ``to the language of force and intimidation,'' two Ethiopian
military aircraft twice bombed an Eritrean air force base Friday in
Asmara.
	   On the first run, the bombers hit two hangers used as workshops,
the tarmac and a nearby junkyard.
	   No injuries were reported although heavy smoke billowed from the
hangar.
	   Hundreds of people on bicycle and on foot rushed to the airbase,
attracted by the sound of the explosions and the heavy smoke in the
air.
	   Eritrean soldiers moved in to clear civilians out of the base
which is right next to Asmara's international airport about 2
kilometers (1.2 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   As far as could be determined, the airport itself was not hit.
	   A U. S. Embassy spokeswoman said plans to evacuate 200 U.S.
citizens, mainly dependents of government employees, non-essential
embassy staff and Peace Corps volunteers, later Friday to Frankfurt
were going ahead as scheduled.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was wearing
thin because of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory
Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   ``I am not declaring war in Eritrea. I am only saying enough is
enough to Eritrean aggression,'' Meles said after announcing that
the army had orders to ``take all necessary measures against
repeated Eritrean aggression.''
	   Shortly before the bombing, the government of Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki had issued a statement expressing ``its firm
commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
	   But it said it would never ``acquiesce to the language of force
and intimidation and weill, if necessary, resolutely defend its
hard-won right to live in peace and freedom.''
	   Meles was speaking Thursday to reporters to announce acceptance
of a four-point proposal by the United States and Rwanda to end a
festering border conflict peacefully.
	   One of the recommendations of the proposal was that Eritrea
withdrawn to positions held before May 6.
	   The Eritrean government statement Friday characterized the four
points as ``not controversial'' but said Eritrea believed there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out.''
	   Eritrea has always claimed it remains inside its own territory
as determined by Italian colonial boundaries.

	   Conclusions and suggestions by the Thailand Development Research
Institute's Working Group on Economic Structure.
	   Problems 1. The working group has concluded that the major
problem confronting the economy is that the country's real sector
is experiencing a lack of competitiveness. This sorry state of
affairs has been reached because Thailand can no longer compete in
the international arena for cheap labour and raw materials. It
needs new factors that will render it competitive again: that is
better productivity in marketing, in agriculture, in industry, in
commerce and in service that is based on technology, skills and
knowledge that increase efficiency and create innovations in
response to demands in the domestic and international markets.
	   During the past three decades the Thai economy has undergone
changes from an agrarian to an industrial economy. Industrial
production has accounted for almost three times as much as
agricultural production. The changes, however, had one important
characteristic: the combination of imported technology and local
labour and natural resources. The products which resulted from the
combination were then exported to be marketed abroad by the trading
arm of foreign corporations.
	   They (the foreign corporations) function as if they were our
''partners'' in business. But the globalisation process has changed
all that. Thailand's former foreign ''partners'' have eyed other
developing countries for their partners under the pull of cheap
labour and fertile natural resources. They have changed positions
from ''partners'' to ''rivals''. There were no longer
justifications for them to convey to Thailand technology and
international marketing facilities.
	   Under some fortunate circumstances, Thailand could sweeten its
incentives to make such foreign partners stay with enactment of
better legislation that boost employees rights and benefits in par
with international standards. All told, if Thailand is to retain
its competitiveness into the next century it must have all of the
above three capabilities and have them in place quick as time for
the transition is running out.
	   2. Another major problem is that the real sector has not worked
to ensure that its developments are permanent in terms of their
impact on the environment and on the wasteful use of raw materials
injurious to natural resources. These two problems are
inter-dependent because they not only cause the scarcity of raw
materials but make international commerce contingent on one
important condition -- products and services must be supplied from
sources that are persistent. Tackling these two problems needs a
revamp of the manufacturing and distribution structures.
	   Main Strategy 3. Since restructuring of such structures is too
wide a scope for this working group to tackle completely given the
time constraint, it has concluded that emphasis should be given
only to areas that become problems. The scope of work covered by
the working group includes making suggestions under the relevant
structural adjustment loan (SAL) and other loan programmes.
	   Planning and implementing an entire macro-economic restructuring
are areas undertaken by the government. Government agencies
directly responsible for these jobs like the Economic and Social
Development Commission is known to be doing just that.
	   This aside, the government has created a commission for
restructuring and boosting competitiveness and a commission for
national industrial development. These two commissions, headed by
deputy prime ministers, are aimed at dealing with overall
structure. This working group will make suggestions on major issues
that lead to a coordinated effort between the agencies routinely
responsible for the jobs and the (special) commissions created by
the government.
	   4. The working group has come of the opinion that
competitiveness needs to be created from quality human resources,
fundamental structures, good governance, management and science and
technology. These factors comprise many constituents. But the most
vital determining factor that would establish permanent
competitiveness for Thailand for now is innovation.
	   An innovation not only means a technological invention but also
introduction of any new product and process that would bring in
advances to activities. An innovation may be a method, a notion, or
an innovative technology arrived at locally or imported and adapted
to suit local needs.
	   Innovations are divided into two kinds: an improvement and a
breakthrough. An improvement is an innovation where industrial
productivity is improved by introducing improved machinery. A
breakthrough is where a new product or service is created, a new
brand name or a new product is developed. Not less important is
where improvement has been made on the process Thailand was
traditionally adept at like growing fragrant jasmine rice and
producing jewellery to a standard accepted internationally. This
kind of effort needs both kinds of innovation. Apart from product
and process, innovation will include the marketing and distribution
system.
	   5. In introducing innovation to streamlining the economy, the
working group has concluded that three vital policy tools should be
used. The first tool involves continuous education and training
needed to construct the base on which to build manufacturing
capabilities and the capabilities to innovate.
	   Capabilities to innovate lead to the application of the other
two tools -- the development of technology and the development of
management. The working group came of the opinion that the
agricultural, the industrial, the commerce and the service sectors
need technological development and that management development is
vital to the restructuring. Besides, conservation of the
environment, in a way consistent with the sustenance of a variety
of activities, needs to be taken simultaneously.
	   6. Economic streamlining under the SAL programme calls for huge
spending because it involves revamps on manufacturing and
distribution in the real sector. An administrative mechanism is
therefor called for.
	   To ensure efficiency in its implementation, a special fund
should be created, called the ''Fund for Economic Streamlining for
the Administration of the Restructuring'' according to the funds
allocated by the government disbursing them from SAL and other
loans, (which may include a portion of the social sector loans).
Since the funds are foreign loans whose principal amount and
interest need to be paid from taxpayers money, they need to be
managed according to a strict rule so the funds are effectively
spent. The management of the funds should be done at two levels --
policy and allocation.
	   6.1 At policy level. A fund policy commission is to be created,
for streamlining the economy. The commission is headed by a deputy
prime minister or finance minister, with ministers or their
deputies at relevant ministries being its directors (Finance,
Science, Agriculture, Industry, Commerce and Labour ministries) and
up to five experts serving as its expert directors. The Office of
Fiscal Economy of the Finance Ministry and the Office of the
National Economic and Social Development Board will act as its
secretaries with the authority to define policies, guidelines, and
scope of the government economic policy.
	   6.2 At fund management level. A commission is to be created for
restructuring the economy, comprising a minimum of five but up to
seven social elites who have earned public trust and who hold no
public or bureaucratic office. The Office of Fiscal Economy and the
Office of National Economic and Social Development Board act as its
secretaries with the authority of allocating funds within the scope
defined by the fund policy commission under 6.1.
	   7. For the sake of continuity of the work, a fund committee
should be set up under a provision of the law, like the Science and
Technology Development Act of 1991. The committee's work will have
to be transparent and subject to monitoring by the mass media and
public.
	   Sectoral Strategy 8. The working committee sees that the
operation should be divided according to economic sectors. That is,
there should be the agricultural sector, industrial sector,
business sector and service sector. There should also be projects
to sustain development and competitiveness in all regions. The
projects should be on environment, education and training. Projects
in each region will not be aimed at solving all problems in the
region, but will seek to tackle the main and critical problems and
should serve as an example of how to create competitiveness and
sustenance with innovations.
	   9. In the agricultural sector, the main question is how to
increase income to farmers by encouraging them to produce products
which are in demand by both consumers and by industry as raw
materials. To achieve this, both the private sector and the
government should try to develop better species and productive
procedures. There should be a system to guarantee investment risks
for farmers and the system to provide loans to farmers should be
overhauled. The loans should be expanded to cover activities
besides farming so that the communities could be developed in a
comprehensive cycle. A system of future markets should be developed
to reduce the uncertainty on prices and amount of products in the
markets.
	   10. In the industrial sector, the main question is how to
re-engineer companies so that they can produce more efficiently and
can make products which are in demand. The solution is to
restructure management, administration, technology and machinery of
companies as well require them to provide training to staff so that
staff could adjust to the new system. The government and private
sector should cooperate in setting up new institutions or launching
pioneer projects to create new skills, like designing, information
technology, development on rubber and foods products.
	   11. In the commercial sector, the main question is how to
restructure the sector so that farm products could be competitive
in the world and Asean markets. Companies should be prompted to
shift their focus on domestic markets to Asean markets by using
Afta as a tool as well as to the world market using regulations of
World Trade Organisation as tools. The companies should develop
their IT expertise to create an efficient consumer response system
as well as applying electronic data exchange to facilitate trade,
which needs fast and efficient transfer of data. The bar code
system should be promoted as a common practice among businesses.
Companies should be prompted to create and develop their own
brands.
	   12. For the service sector, the working committee sees that the
management and technological aspects of the sector should be
restructured. An institute and mechanism should be created to
permit privatisation of telecom, transport and state enterprises.
There should be projects to protect consumers and measures against
monopoly as well as projects for distribution of tourism income to
local communities as well as projects to reduce congestion at
tourist spots and to rehabilitate tourism spots.
	   13. All the re-engineering plans will depend on a key factor --
ability and quality of people at all levels. As a result, education
and teaching new skills should be employed as a tool to develop the
quality of an employee. As an example, the working committee
proposes a tele-education system to train those who already have
jobs. The tele-education could be a virtual system in which
trainees could receive training at any time. Trainees could learn
from real problems. The training system should receive cooperation
from the private sector, educational institutions and the
government.
	   14. To ensure the sustenance of natural resources and society,
measures need to be taken to protect the environment and to prevent
pollution from industry as well as to treat industry and community
waste. To do this, a system to collect fees for waste treatment and
environment protection should be laid down as well as prompting the
private sector to be more competitive in business. New investment
policies should be adjusted as ''green policies'' which should
screen out environmentally unfriendly projects. The working
committee has suggested some projects, like ''green loans'' which
will provide incentives to investors to employ
environmentally-friendly measures; projects to support medium-sized
and small companies to employ environmentally-friendly measures;
projects to treat agricultural chemical wastes; and the
re-engineering of government agencies in line with environmental
management.
	   15. The working group has based its proposals on the preceding
suggestions. The suggestions are divided, according to their
contents, into: (1) agriculture; (2) industry; (3) commerce; (4)
service; (5) continued education and refresher training and (6)
natural resources and the environment. Each sector has its own
action plans, project proposals and the prioritisation of such
plans and proposals, in a bid to clarify the contents of the
proposals and the specific plans. In selecting a proposal it is
believed the fund managing commissions under points 6 and 7 would
invite comments widely from the public and private sectors so the
most beneficial and most appropriate project would be selected.
	   The said plans have not been complete. Working papers containing
the basic plan of action that cannot be freely called comprehensive
or even strategic are used as pilot plans that have the potential
of being upgraded into a concrete national plan.
	   Apart from proposed plans, the working group has considered
factors vital to restructuring, the improvement to legislation, the
reforming of the duties and roles of the bureaucrats, the boosting
of rights and the welfare of workers. All these factors contribute
towards creating a Thailand that is permanently competitive in the
global market and are issues that need continuous tackling by the
government, on top of the plans proposed.
	   Additional information is available in appendices 1 and 2.
Appendix 1 is working papers compiled as part of the suggestions
proposed. Appendix 2 is a compilation of papers intended as
background information for relevant issues.

Volkswagen wins control of Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: COMBINING previous and SUBBING 14th graf to show date Vickers
hopes to close deal, SUBBING 5th graf to add context to Crowe's
quote; minor editing  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG won shareholder approval Friday to
buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. for 430 million pounds (dlrs 700
million), despite angry bursts of nationalism from small investors
who fought to keep the luxury carmaker British.
	   Vickers PLC, the corporation that owns Rolls-Royce, announced at
the end of a stormy meeting that investors had agreed to sell
Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen, the German company that is Europe's
biggest automaker.
	   Proxy votes and votes from big institutional shareholders had
made the approval a done deal, but Vickers held off the
announcement until it had counted ballots from the little
shareholders who made the big noise.
	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' shareholder Rodney Crowe
asked during the special meeting.
	   ``What are we going to have? A flying lady on the front of the
Beetle?'' Crowe said later, conjuring up an image of the
distinctive Rolls-Royce hood ornament placed on a Volkswagen Bug.
	   Some investors sounded like they were ready to refight World War
II in a session where they first rejected a bid of 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) from rival German automaker BMW.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers in the packed auditorium when he
referred to Volkswagen's history in Nazi Germany.
	   Volkswagen faces not just vocal objections but some real
potential hurdles at it moves to take over production of luxury
Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, which cost at minimum around dlrs
250,000 each.
	   The jilted suitor, BMW, supplies some engines to Rolls-Royce and
has threatened to cut off deliveries. BMW spokesman Uwe Mahla said
in Munich that Friday's developments were ``for us a very suprising
situation,'' and BMW sources said executives were holding an
emergency meeting.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC, a separate company that makes jet engines,
controls the brand name and logo and has made it clear it would
rather see the deal go to BMW, which happens to be its partner in a
jet engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC has not said whether it will negotiate with
Volkswagen or try to block its use of the brand name.
	   Asked about that, the Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler,
insisted that a 25-year-old contract that would let Rolls-Roye PLC
veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Ltd. by a foreign
buyer is legally unenforceable.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the flying lady and Bentley.''
	   But some shareholders expressed worries that the Rolls
production line could be halted by the dispute. Vickers hopes to
close the deal by July 3.
	   And at least one expressed disgust at the fight over a name that
epitomizes handmade British luxury.
	   ``It's harmful for Rolls-Royce PLC and it's harmful for Vickers
and they don't seem to care,'' Carol Day said. ``They're behaving
like 6-year-old children.''
	   The takeover announcement also was delayed by a Rolls-Royce
enthusiasts group, Crewe Motors, which claimed it was on the verge
of putting together a 500 million pound (dlrs 815 million) offer
from private backers.
	   Its chairman, lawyer Michael Shrimpton, who has failed in
previous attempts to put together a bid, forced Vickers to adjourn
the meeting for nearly one hour, but the Vickers chairman was
unconvinced and refused any further delays.

	   PENANG, Wed. - An expert on Malay traditional performing arts
today urged the authorities and interested parties to stop making
an issue out of the temporary ban on dikir barat in Kelantan.
	   In making the call, former Universiti Sains Malaysia associate
professor Dr Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof suggested that steps be taken to
preserve the authenticity of the dikir barat.
	   Ghulam, a noted authority on traditional Malay theatre, is
director of the newly established The Asian Centre in Penang and
lecturer at the National Academy of Arts under the Ministry of
Culture, Arts and Tourism in Kuala Lumpur.
	   He was commenting on Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk
Sabbaruddin Chik's statement that Kelantan's decision to ban the
dikir barat might affect tourist arrivals and that it was too early
to determine the impact of the ban.
	   The Kelantan Government banned the dikir barat on May 28.
	   Ghulam said the inclusion of pop culture and pop songs would
certainly threaten whatever little authenticity was left in the
dikir barat.
	   He said it was orginally religious in character but over the
years became secularised and a tool for propaganda.
	   ``However, as the ban is temporary and a policy regarding dikir
barat is being formulated, let us wait for the policy and study it
first.''
	   He said there were certain elements in traditional Malay theatre
which contravened Islamic culture and the issue should be how far
such elements should be tolerated.
	   ``There are also such elements in wayang kulit, mak yong and
menora but the matter can be resolved rationally by determining the
acceptable limits to modification within these art forms,'' said
Ghulam.

	   THANKS to two Americans and the Internet, Maitai, a stray dog,
will find a new home in the United States.
	   Linda Kiel from Madison, Wisconsin, will fly to Thailand in
order to adopt the bitch on June 10 after learning of its
misfortune which was posted on a web site by Mina Sharpe, 18.
	   In January, Maitai was hit by a car in Prachuap Khiri Khan's Hua
Hin district, resulting in a broken back. Fortunately, Sharpe
learned of the accident shortly after it occurred.
	   After learning that Thonglor Veterinary Hospital was likely the
best facility for Maitai, the American woman took the dog there.
She left an initial US$300 with staff for Maitai's treatment before
leaving the country, maintaining contact with the hospital to keep
paying the fees.
	   At the same time, she posted Maitai's story on a web site where
she asked for a new home for the dog. Sharpe said Kiel agreed on
May 21 to adopt Maitai and take her to the US for further
treatment.

	   THE Kulim Hi-Tech Park (KHTP) multi-million IT Centre in Kedah
is set to serve as a platform to bring information technology to
both users and providers of technology in the northern region of
the country.
	   Targeted to be officially launched by Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Dr Mahathir Mohamad in August, the IT Centre will also serve as the
IT hub for Kedah, while providing IT consultancy and other services
to the neighbouring States and the Asean region.
	   The IT Centre is managed by KTM which is a joint venture between
Kulim Technology Park Corporation (KTPC) - the developer of KHTP -
and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).
	   Group general manager of Kulim Technology Management Sdn Bhd
(KTM) Mazlee Md Ramli said the RM13 million IT Centre will be
offering services like training, turnkey projects, sale of
hardware, software development and incubation centres.
	   Soon, he said, the IT Centre will also house the Network
Excellence Centre - a joint networking development project
involving KTM, 3Com Asia Ltd (M) and Stacks Technology Sdn Bhd -
aimed at providing networking solutions for KHTP.
	   The three parties signed a teaming agreement in Kuala Lumpur on
Tuesday, with KTM represented by its director Ahmad Shukri Tajuddin
and Mazlee, 3Com by its South Asia managing director Marcel Jacobs
and country manager Pang Yee Beng, and Stacks Technology by its
managing director Dr Nah Soo Hoe and Penang branch manager Liew
Chin Hock.
	   Under the agreement, 3Com will provide the hardware, technical
knowledge and training to KTM while Stacks Technology, a 3Com
authorised network systems integrator, will serve as network
integrator for the installation of network cabling systems within
the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) of KHTP.
	   Stacks Technology will also provide network-related training to
KTM's personnel and KHTP's tenants.
	   The Network Excellence Centre which involves an initial
investment of RM1.5 million, will be the first site in Malaysia to
implement 3Com's Gigabit Ethernet solution for its LAN
requirements.
	   A Gigabit Ethernet environment, said Mazlee, will enable
effective high- bandwidth delivery within the LAN which, in this
case, comprises anyone who is connected to the IT Centre. In
addition, Gigabit Ethernet also delivers class of service (CoS)
capabilities which allow traffic prioritisation according to
business needs.
	   The investment covers the first phase of the project, that is,
the setting up of the hardware and software infrastructure, due to
be completed by the end of next month.
	   Under this set-up, the network will illustrate the concept of a
collapsed backbone topology that provides a centralised management
information system (MIS) for higher performance interconnectivity.
	   The system is made up of 3Com's SuperStack II Switch 9300 which
serves as the backbone supporting seven collapsed Gigabit Ethernet
segments and servers that are integrated with 3Com's CoreBuilder
7000HD Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) connectivity.
	   For the LAN, 3Com's SuperStack II Switch 3900, 3000 and 1100
will provide 10/100 megabits per second (Mbps) Ethernet to the
desktop. KHTP will engage 3Com's NetBuilder router - offering
flexibility and high bandwidth - for the WAN.
	   KHTP, the country's first hi-tech park and regarded as ``the
science city of the future'', has to date attracted more than RM15
billion worth of investments from 27 multinational hi-tech
companies.

	   The Business Desk examines the Thailand Development Research
Institute's far-reaching reform proposal.
	   The goal is to upgrade the competitiveness of Thai industries
and sustain it. The target is manpower and education development.
The mechanism is a permanent national committee which does not rise
or fall with politics of the day. The vision is to create a more
innovative society.
	   Is it practical and achievable? The researchers at Thailand
Development Research Institute (TDRI), which has presented the
proposal to the government, said there is no other choice because
Thailand is no longer competitive in many export sectors while the
management and labour skills have to be rebuilt from scratch if
they are to move the country forward.
	   The TDRI study is the first of its kind to take a holistic
approach to solving the country's competitiveness problems. Former
science minister Phaichitr Uathavikul was the chairman of a working
group on this study. Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Wednesday
asked his deputy, Supachai Panitchpakdi, to oversee the
implementations.
	   It is a challenge ahead for the coalition government to put it
into effect speedily as the TDRI has pointed out that the
rebuilding of Thai industries is already five years late.
	   The government will also need to find a massive US$2.4 billion
to finance the economic restructuring. The money made available
earlier for industrial restructuring has already been spent
elsewhere, making it necessary to find new funding sources.
	   TDRI has suggested that the national committee to oversee the
restructuring process should be a permanent one. It should also be
staffed with professionals with the relevant knowledge. The
think-tank also warned that the industries must be rebuilt with
awareness not to create environmental problems which would defeat
the purpose.
	   The task ahead is a gigantic one in many respects. The
restructuring is very much a bottom-up process because the real
weakness is in the quality of Thai workers. Seventy per cent of the
workers in the industrial sector have primary education or less and
will be difficult to upgrade without retraining.
	   The roadmap to sustainable competitiveness for the Thai economy
with more quality manpower will henceforth be made up of
innovation, then science and technology development and eventually
management improvement.
	   The TDRI study said that Thailand has insufficient human and
social capital to sustain the entire system in the era of
globalisation. Human resources are not lacking in volume but in the
skills essential to compete in the modern industrial world.
	   The lack of social capital, on the other hand, is due to the
inability of various institutions' work culture and the standards
and values which society places in accumulating wisdom,
responsibility and ethics.
	   ''We also need new human and social capital which can increase
the knowhow in technology transfer and management development.
These are factors vital in making the Thai society a sustainable
one,'' said the study.
	   TDRI suggested revamping the entire agriculture, industry,
commerce and service sectors. The entire process is too large to
undertake given the limited resources. The think-tank proposed that
there ought to be new capabilities for the private sector built up
in production, distribution and services. This also includes the
ability of the public sector to support the private sector and the
people in general to acquire new capabilities.

	   A GOLD rush is anticipated when collectors hurry to buy a coin
commemorating the opening of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok _ at
more than three times its face value.
	   The 22-carat gold coin will on one side feature a design
symbolising the ascent of Hong Kong into the new millennium, and on
the other the Bauhinia.
	   The coin is legal tender with a face value of $1,000.
	   But splashing out on $1,000 worth of anything would be an
expensive mistake, as the coin costs $3,288.
	   HongkongBank is prepared for a rush as the coins are issued in a
limited edition of only 15,000, with 7,000 of these not available
in Hong Kong.
	   HongkongBank has promised to hold a ballot in the event of
over-subscription.
	   Coin purchases are limited to one per Hong Kong ID card holder.
	   Collectors have until 15 June to rush to selected HongkongBank
branches for application forms.
	   Donations will be made to charities from sales proceeds.
	   Coins will be issued on 6 July, the day the airport opens.
	   The collectors items have been produced by the Royal Mint in the
UK.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb ripped through a theater in the
heart of the Punjab capital on Friday, killing three people and
injuring 13 others, authorities said.
	   The bomb went off during a matinee movie in a congested central
district of Lahore, the ancient capital of Pakistan's Punjab
province, they said. About 50 people were in the theater.
Eyewitnesses said 30 seats were blown apart.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility. Pakistan's government
blamed neighboring India. Pakistan and India routinely accuse each
other of sabotage. Relations between the two countries have been
particularly tense since both exploded nuclear devices.
	   ``This act was done by Indians,'' said Miraj Din, a spokesman
for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League. ``We were expecting
something like this.''
	   Din said his government received prior warning from its
intelligence agencies that India sent secret service agents into
Pakistan ``to disrupt law and order.''
	   There was no evidence to substantiate Din's accusations.
	   Police say they believe the bombers died in the explosion.
	   However, it was unclear whether it was a suicide bomber or
someone unknowingly carried the parcel into the theater, said
Police Chief Wahab Ali.
	   Ahmed Raza, 33, who was sitting next to the men who carried in
the bomb and died when it exploded, said he had left his seat to
get a drink of water when he heard a powerful noise.
	   ``I didn't know what it was,'' he said. ``I looked back, and the
two boys were dead. There was blood and body parts.''
	   The guard outside the Mubarak Theater said he checked patrons as
they entered the theater.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the Asian
subcontinent gained independence in 1947.

	   IT won't be until August before Malaysians will know whether
Olympic 100m champion Donovan Bailey and other top Canadian
athletes will be competing in the Commonwealth Games in September.
	   Canadian team manager for the KL Games, Debbie Bryant, who is on
a 10- day pre-Games visit in Kuala Lumpur, said Canada's athletics
squad would only be announced on Aug 3 by their respective
trainers.
	   ``We won't know if Bailey will be coming until after the
selection process,'' said Debbie.
	   ``Some of these athletes would compete in both the World Cup in
Johannesburg and the Kuala Lumpur Games while others may compete in
only one of the events.
	   ``It's up to the individual athlete and their coaches to decide
in relation to their respective training programmes.
	   ``We won't know until they finalise the list,'' said Debbie
after being briefed on the Games' progress by Sukom Ninety-Eight at
Bukit Jalil yesterday.
	   She said that about 150 of the expected 277-member Canadian
contingent will be stationed in Penang from Aug 31 to get
acclimatised to local conditions while the rest will arrive in
batches.
	   ``In North America, the Commonwealth Games are only second to
the Olympics.
	   ``Canada will definitely send their best for all the events.
	   ``Besides, KL is a stepping stone for some of our athletes in
anticipating the Sydney 2000 Olympics.''
	   She said the Canadian Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF)
delegates were impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities at the
Bukit Jalil Sports Complex.
	   ``We are extremely pleased with what we've seen. I think the
facilities are good enough to host the Olympics.
	   ``Malaysia has certainly established a very high standard for
future Commonwealth Games.''
	   The Canadian delegation also praised Malaysia in their
preparations to ensure that competitors are received in a
comfortable environment.
	   However, their main concern is adapting to the hot and humid
conditions.
	   ``We are not too concerned about the haze but more on the
tropical weather. We understand that the haze is difficult to
control. It's all part of the environment and we must learn to live
with it,'' she added.

	   ALPHATEC Electronics Plc on Thursday won court approval for its
financial rehabilitation, proposed by six of its major creditors,
becoming the country's first approval under the new bankruptcy law.
	   The court appointed Price Waterhouse, an international auditing
firm, as the ''planner'' who would ensure that the rehabilitation
is conducted as projected.
	   The six creditors assured the Civil Court on Thursday that they
were able to rehabilitate the firm despite its outstanding loans of
Bt15 billion. The company's creditors are Bangkok Bank, Credit
Agricole Indosuez Thailand, ING NV's BIBF in Chon Buri, Nakornthon
Bank, Standard Chartered Bank Thailand, and Sumitomo Bank's BIBF.
	   Over 30 representatives of Alphatech's creditors attended the
hearing on Thursday.
	   Now that the petition has been approved, creditors will now have
to file for repayments with the ''receiver'' within a month after a
planner has been appointed.
	   The planner would then give the receiver a rehabilitation plan
within three months after its been appointed. Creditors will then
hold a meeting to consider endorsement of the rehabilitation plan
and the receiver will then report the result to the court.
	   Chutiporn Chomphuphol, ING Bank's loan department manager who
also acted as chief of the creditors' panel, said she believed that
the firm could be rehabilitated because ''Alphatech was known for
its impressive performance. However, it suffered huge net losses in
1997 due to the economic slowdown, liquidity crunch, management
problems, excessive short-term loans and huge expenditure''.
	   Last year, Alphatec's net loss was Bt15.4 billion while
outstanding loans exceeded US$450 million.
	   Chutiporn said rehabilitation would be easier if the creditors
could change short-term debts to long-term ones and inject more
cash into the company.
	   ''Without rehabilitation, the company will record a rise in
debts and will go bankrupt eventually, affecting many parties,
namely creditors, debtors, the state which cannot collect taxes and
unemployed workers,'' she said in court.
	   She added that so far it appears that Alphatech can be
rehabilitated because its factories are ready for production and a
customer base. Earlier, the creditors could not inject loans into
the company because their was no law supporting the move.
	   ''We filed the petition because the Alphatec's management did
not oppose the move,'' she said.
	   The creditors' petition was approved despite opposition from
Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand (IFCT), another Alphatec
creditor, which was filed on Wednesday saying that the
rehabilitation plan should protect all creditors and should be
supported by all parties.
	   Since the petition had been filed by only six creditors it would
never succeed, IFCT said in its affidavit, adding that the planner
was not yet ready with the plan.
	   In the preliminary plan, the six creditors did not mention how
much would be written off in bad debts. IFCT claimed that suggested
conversion of debts to equity would affect collaterals because it
would prevent creditors from protecting themselves.
	   Another reason for opposition put forward by IFCT was that the
rehabilitation move did not receive cooperation from creditors of
collateralised loans.
	   Price Waterhouse (Thailand) director Siriphong Supakijjanusorn
defended his company saying it had previously rehabilitated 150
companies worldwide.
	   Thaweesak na Takuathung, a lawyer with Kanung  Partners, led
the creditors' support for the rehabilitation plan.
	   He told reporters that IFCT had filed the opposition because it
was afraid it might not win support in the rehabilitation plan.
	   ''IFCT is afraid that its loan to Alphatec will be written
off,'' he said.
	   Senator Sansern Kraijitti, chairman of the House Committee
screening the fourth Bankruptcy Act, said that the court's
procedures were quick and complied with legal requirements. He
added that IFCT did not understand the procedures even though it
was a state enterprise.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Blowing horns and whistles,
waving flags and banners, thousands of fans streamed towards Kosevo
stadium Friday for the final of Bosnia's soccer championship.
	   The duel featured eternal rivals Zeljeznicar and Sarajevo _ but
the real prize is something Bosnia's disunited soccer teams have
not known: a ticket to the European Championship League for the
winner.
	   ``This may not be a World Cup match, but it is incredibly
important for the Bosnian football,'' said Liam McDowall, a U.N.
spokesman.
	   Almost all of the 40,000 tickets were sold out in a match that
served as a final preparation for monitoring the World Cup from
armchairs in front of TV screens.
	   Neighboring Yugoslavia and Croatia are competing in France, but
Bosnia's soccer has been as disunited as the country itself and the
national team had no chance of qualifying.
	   This year, for the first time since war erupted in 1992, soccer
teams from Bosnian Croat- and Muslim-dominated regions competed for
the national championship. Four from the Muslim regions and two
Croat sides competed in two groups.
	   Claiming security concerns, teams from the Bosnian Serb substate
_ Republika Srpska _ refused to participate. But everybody expects
them aboard in the next season.
	   It has taken three years for international sports organizations
and foreign diplomats charged with implementing peace to negotiate
a solution for Bosnia's disunited sports.
	   The 4-2 Muslim-Croat combination was also adopted for this
year's Bosnian basketball championships _ which the Serbs are also
expected to join in 1999. The Croat side Siroki Brijeg defeated
Sarajevo's Bosna, former European champions, for the local
basketball crown.
	   In recent weeks, the two groups in soccer played in Sarjaevo and
the tense southwestern town of Mostar. Hundreds of fans traveled
back and forth without incident _ to the delight of Western
diplomats still trying to overcome ethnic tensions.
	   ``Even a year ago ... it would have been very difficult to
imagine such games take place in Mostar without any trouble,'' said
Martin Garrod, senior international official in Mostar.
	   Fearing ethnic riots, U.N. police closely monitored each game.
	   Fans simply want to see the best players.
	   ``There was the war, but it's over now,'' said Sead Beric, a
Zeljeznicar fan, heading for the stadium. ``Now, without all good
players, whether they are Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Jews,
Eskimos or others, we cannot hope to become something in world
soccer and participate in the next World Cup.''

	   THE Perlis FA have lodged a police report in Kangar after one of
their three foreign players was threatened with bodily harm on
Sunday.
	   The incident occurred in a restaurant when a man, professing to
be a fan, confronted the player to remonstrate about his
performance.
	   In the heat of the moment, some shoving ensued between the two
and harsh words were exchanged.
	   The player claimed that threats were issued against him and
decided to complain to the FA.
	   ``We've lodged a police report to protect his safety,'' said
Perlis FA president Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim.
	   The foreign players in the team are Thai Kiatisuk Senamuang,
Ghanaian Henry Acquah and Moroccan Mohamed Akrane.

	   IF President Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton were to
change their minds and agree to hold a meeting in Hong Kong, one of
them will have to cross the harbour to make it happen.
	   The two presidents will be staying at hotels on opposite sides
of the harbour, when they visit next month.
	   It has been learnt that Mr Jiang will be staying at the Harbour
Plaza Hotel in Hung Hom, while Mr Clinton will be checking into the
J W Marriott in Admiralty.
	   A spokesman for the Harbour Plaza Hotel said Mr Jiang would
probably occupy the presidential suite at the hotel.
	   Arrangements had yet to be confirmed, she added.
	   The hotel, owned by property tycoon Li Ka-shing, has a short but
notable tradition of receiving mainland leaders.
	   Mr Jiang and former premier Li Peng stayed at the hotel when
they attended the handover ceremony last year.
	   Mr Li revisited the hotel with then vice-premier Zhu Rongji when
they attended the World Bank/International Monetary Fund conference
last August.
	   The presidential suite is located in the 19th floor of the
20-storey of the hotel. The charge for one night is $29,500.
	   The J W Marriott Hotel was not available for comment.

	   WHILE many Thai companies are struggling with recapitalisation,
Songkhla Canning Plc (SC) said all of its 18 million capital
increase shares were subscribed to by its existing shareholders.
	   ''The success of the company's capital increase is partially due
to the company's consecutive growth on its performances;
particularly this year in which the company has increased its
exports to markets worldwide,'' Cheng Niruttinanon, SC chairman,
said.
	   SC, a major manufacturer and exporter of canned seafood, earlier
announced it would double its registered capital to Bt360 million
via the issue of 18 million new shares. The new shares were offered
to existing shareholders at the ratio of one old share to one new
share at Bt20.
	   The share price of SC closed unchanged at Bt67.
	   According to Cheng, the new money will increase cash flow for
exports and help the company expand its markets.
	   He said 80 per cent of its main revenue was generated by the
sale of canned tuna while the remaining 20 per cent was derived
from the sale of canned shrimp, crab and clams. The company ranks
as one of the top three canned tuna exporters in Thailand. Almost
all of its products are exported to the United States, Europe,
Japan and the Middle East.
	   The domestic raw materials, including shrimp, crab and clams,
also helps to reduce the company's production costs. Only tuna,
which is the main raw material, has to be imported. The two sources
of tuna for the company are the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
	   Cheng said in 1997, SC was able to pay a dividend of Bt13.50 per
share. In the first quarter of this year, the company and its
subsidiaries together posted Bt144.48 million in profit, 111.9 per
cent higher than its profit of Bt76.29 million in the same period a
year earlier.
	   Songkhla Canning is a subsidiary of Thai Union Frozen Products
Plc, which recently completed its recapitalisation. The parent
company realised around Bt180 apiece from the offering.

  Eds: CORRECTS runs added by Fighters in 2nd graf to 2 from 3  

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Nippon Ham Fighters edged the Chiba Lotte
Marines 5-4 Friday night at Tokyo Dome to climb into first place in
the Pacific League standings.
	   Trailing by two runs in the seventh inning, veteran slugger
Hiromitsu Ochiai hit a bases-loaded double to tie the game. The
Fighters added two more runs in the inning to take the lead.
	   In Fukuoka, Akira Okamoto tossed a three-hitter to lead the
Kintetsu Buffaloes to a 6-0 win over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, who
slipped to second place with the loss.
	   Kintetsu infielder Phil Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox,
batted in two runs in the sixth to open the scoring for the
Buffaloes.
	   Seibu Lions slugger Brian Raabe smashed a solo homerun in the
third and Domingo Martinez batted in two runs in the eighth as the
Lions beat the last-place Orix Bluewave 4-2 at Seibu Dome.
	   Raabe played formerly with Colorado Rockies and Martinez played
with Triple-A Rochester.
	   In the Central League, Yomiuri Giants pitcher Hiromi Makihara
gave up no runs over eight-plus innings as the Giants blanked the
Chunichi Dragons 1-0 at Nagoya Dome.
	   Hiroo Ishii batted in the Giants' only run in the first off a
sacrifice fly.
	   With the win, Yomiuri climbed into second place, while the
Dragons slipped to third.
	   No other Central League games were scheduled for Friday.

	   PETALING JAYA, Wed. - Malaysian Trades Union Congress
secretary-general G.
	   Rajasekaran said today he stood by his statements at a forum in
the United States two years ago that some employers were engaged in
anti-union activities.
	   Saying that he would continue to raise shortcomings of the
country's industrial relations at local and international forums,
Rajasekaran said Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek was
lying when he accused him of spreading lies about the country while
abroad.
	   Speaking at a Press conference at the MTUC headquarters in USJ
following Lim's move last week to make public a video tape of the
forum, Rajasekaran said: ``I have not been telling lies as claimed
by Lim because I have forwarded to the Ministry the identity of the
company - a textile firm operating from the Prai Free Trade Zone -
which had created its in-house union before appointing its
personnel manager as the president.
	   ``Naturally, I am surprised that the Minister has accused me of
not being able to back up my claim. Either he has not read the
letter we sent to the Ministry or he pretended not to know.''
	   Rajasekaran said he was prepared for a public debate over the
matter if Lim continued to ``misrepresent'' the matter.
	   ``Anti-union activities by employers have happened in the past
and are still happening,'' he said, adding that he was prepared to
name the companies involved if requested by the Ministry.
	   This included a firm at the Teluk Panglima Garang Industrial
Zone which concluded a collective agreement with its in-house
union, which turned out to be a sports club whose chairman was the
company's personnel officer.
	   On May 28, Lim made public a video tape as proof that
Rajasekaran had been spreading lies about the country's labour
movement at the forum, organised by the World Bank and
International Labour Organisation.
	   Lim said Rajasekaran's claims that there were companies which
had created in-house unions and appointed their personnel managers
as presidents were baseless.
	   Rajasekaran was also said to have criticised the role of the
National Labour Advisory Council, claiming that the Human Resources
Minister had implemented decisions contrary to those endorsed by
the council.
	   To this, Rajasekaran said the remark was made by the forum's
chairman when summing up input from participants.
	   He said Lim was also wrong when he said that he (Rajasekaran)
had retracted his claims about the NLAC via a letter to the
organiser.
	   ``It was to the contrary. I sent the letter to the forum's
chairman, informing her that she had erred in her summary and
requested that the records be corrected accordingly.''
	   He expressed surprise that Lim continued to make an issue out of
the video tape although the NLAC had considered the controversy
resolved in 1996 following his explanation.
	   When approached by reporters at his office today, Lim said he
might reply to the latest claims by Rajasekaran.

	   FIVE major oil companies have agreed to increase the number of
petrol stations selling 91 octane gasoline this month in support of
the government's policy to promote the use of lower octane gasoline
products, an official from the National Energy Policy Office said
on Thursday.
	   Nepo's Deputy Secretary General Metta Banturngsuk said that
every petrol station in Bangkok and the metropolitan area operated
by PTT, Esso, Caltex and Bangchak will soon start selling 91 octane
gasoline. Shell will increase the number of its stations supplying
the product to 75 per cent of the total from the present 50 per
cent.
	   The five companies dominate the retail petrol industry with 81
per cent of the market.
	   A month ago, Nepo kicked off a campaign to promote the use of
lower rated petrol products in order to save valuable foreign
exchange.
	   ''Previously, the use of 91 octane petrol was confined to
motorcycles, which discouraged petrol station operators from
selling it. But as a result of the government's campaign, many
motorists have now switched to it, prompting oil companies to
adjust their marketing policies,'' Metta said.
	   Shell, however, could not sell 91 octane at all of its retail
outlets as some have relatively small oil storage capacities, he
said.
	   Within one month of the campaign, Metta said consumption of
octane-95 gasoline had fallen by 8 per cent to 65 per cent while
the share of 91 gasoline increased by 7 per cent to 34 per cent.
However, the market share of 87 octane, a new product, amounted to
a low 1 per cent.
	   The changes, he said, helped the country and consumers to save
Bt30 million for the month -- Bt25 million from the higher sales of
91 octane and Bt5 million from the 87 octane. If this continues, it
will save Bt192 million a year through the government's two
mandatory measures implemented earlier, including the withdrawal of
super petrol (premium gasoline with soft value protection additive)
and the abolishment of additives in 87 octane petrol.
	   The 91 petrol is usually Bt0.60 per litre cheaper than 95
petrol.
	   The saving, however, is still far below the government's target
as Nepo has set out to increase the share of 91 and 87 gasoline
products to 65 per cent and 10 per cent while reducing the share of
91 petrol to 25 per cent.
	   Ninety-seven per cent of PTT stations in Bangkok were selling
the 91 petrol, compared with 75 per cent of Shell, 72 per cent of
Esso and 100 per cent in case of Bangchak and Caltex as of May 25.
There were 157 stations in the city selling 87 petrol.
	   PTT, Shell, Esso, Caltex and Bangchak have 223, 237, 205, 185
and 164 outlets respectively in the city.

	   ABOUT 100 mostly young people last night braved torrential rain
to attend Macau's annual candlelight vigil in commemoration of the
1989 Tiananmen crackdown.
	   The New Democratic Macau Association, which organised the event
blamed the low number of participants on the rain.
	   ``In spite of the rain, we carry on,'' said head of the
association, Ng Kuok-cheong. ``The most important point is not to
forget the pro-democracy fighters who died in Beijing nine years
ago.'' Last night's number of participants was the lowest since the
annual candlelight vigil was launched by Macau's pro-democracy
movement in 1990. About 300 people attended last year.
	   About a dozen uniformed policemen monitored the vigil, which
also included a video presentation of the events preceding and
following the 1989 pro-democracy clampdown. There was also a photo
exhibition about the incident.
	   Several participants at the vigil told reporters on condition of
anonymity that the Chinese government should revise its verdict on
the Tiananmen incident. They also appealed to Beijing to respect
human rights.
	   Mr Ng said he was determined to continue the annual Tiananmen
candlelight vigil even after the enclave's reversion to Chinese
rule in December next year.
	   The vigil took place at the Sao Domingos square in the city
centre.
	   Mr Ng is the only deputy to Macau's 23-member legislature who
openly supported the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989.
	   Mr Ng's pro-democracy association garnered 8 per cent of the
direct votes in the legislative election in September 1996.

	   THE Industry Ministry has told the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT) to suspend its plans for injecting additional
capital into the cash-strapped oil-refining subsidiary Thai Oil Co.
	   Plagued by debts worth US$1.5 billion and a capital base as low
as Bt20 million, Thai Oil is said to be in dire straits.
	   Industry Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said on Thursday that PTT
should look into other alternatives apart from its capital increase
plan because it is preparing to privatise and meet the government's
austerity policy for state enterprises.
	   ''PTT is restructuring after which it might not need to increase
capital for Thaioil itself since other sources of funding may be
available,'' Somsak said.
	   PTT had proposed to inject between Bt3 to Bt5 billion into Thai
Oil. The country's largest oil refinery is currently conducting a
number of salvage programmes, mainly negotiating with buyers for a
25 per cent stake, currently held by the Chowkwanyun group, and
restructuring its ownership structure with subsidiaries, namely
Thai Paraxylene Co, Independent Power (Thailand) Co, Thaioil Power
Co, Thai Carbon Products Co and Thai Lubebase Oil Co.
	   Thai Oil's paid-up capital has been kept low because its
previous attempts to increase capital had been stalled by
politicians and by conflicts between shareholders.
	   The Chowkwanyun group, burned badly by its finance company which
was one of the 56 closed down last year, was unable to increase its
25 per cent stake in Thai Oil due to a lack of resources.
	   PTT holds a 49 per cent stake in Thai Oil, Shell Petroleum NV
holds 15.05 per cent and Caltex Trading and Transport 4.75 per
cent.
	   Meanwhile, PTT governor Pala Sookawesh said PTT did not plan to
sell its 24 per cent holding in Bangchak, due to the low prices
quoted in the stock market, unless there were investors proposing
to pay appropriate prices.
	   However, Pala said he had asked Bangchak to do a report on
clearly separated accounts on assets, oil sales and supplementary
businesses as well as the oil market situation since these would
inform investors about Bangchak stocks.
	   Bangchak currently produces 120,000 barrels per day in Bangkok
and operates 1,200 oil retailing networks.

EU approves joint Alcatel-Thomson control of satellite firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The EU approved Friday plans by the
French engineering company Alcatel-Alsthom and the French defense
electronics firm of Thomson CSF to take joint control of a
satellite firm, Societe Commune de Satellites.
	   The European Commission cleared the takeover of after the two
parties made concessions reducing the risk of Thomson gaining a
dominant position in the satellite components market.
	   ``SCS will operate the business activities of its parent
companies, as well as those of (state-controlled aerospace group)
Aerospatiale in the satellites sector,'' a Commission statement
said.
	   The plan by Alcatel and Thomson CSF to take joint control of SCS
was notified to the Commission in April. At the same time, Alcatel
said it planned to buy a minority stake in Thomson CSF, a unit of
the state-owned Thomson SA.
	   The Commission approved the sale to Alcatel on May 26. Under EU
law it can veto alliances or mergers if it judges these hinder fair
competition in the 15-nation EU.
	   The French government said last year it intended to sell a
minority share of Thomson CSF to Alcatel. The move is part of a
plan to privatize Thomson CSF.

	   INSOLVENCY experts from Britain are coming to crisis-hit Asia in
increasing numbers, particularly Thailand.
	   According to a Financial Times report, more than 120 of
Britain's leading experts in company rescues -- 10 per cent of the
senior insolvency profession -- are working in the stricken
economies of Southeast Asia on behalf of international banking
syndicates and financial regulators.
	   FT said the confidential assignments, representing an investment
of up to US$245 million a year in partner and staff time, range
from assessing the repercussions of the current crisis for
developed nations to rescuing companies from failure.
	   The London-based business newspaper said the experts are also
beginning to pick up specific corporate rescue work here in
Thailand as businesses struggle with bad debts from
dollar-denominated borrowings, and a sharp contraction in local
demand.
	   Murdoch McKillop, president of the Society of Practitioners of
Insolvency was quoted as saying: ''There's a lot of the UK
profession out there. We have learnt a lot about rescue culture.
We've moved a long way from shutting doors and getting the
auctioneers in. We have been able to act as a bridge between the
international banking community and local corporates.'' The ''Big
Six'' accountancy firms, including Price Waterhouse, Coopers and
Lybrand, Arthur Andersen, and Ernst and Young, are said to have had
up to 800 staff in Southeast Asia in the past six to nine months
including legal back-up from London-based firms.
	   FT said the insolvency profession expects more work as companies
that have so far survived on operating cashflow turn to overseas
banks for new money.

	   SHOP rentals at Housing Authority commercial premises might be
cut to benefit about 9,200 business owners but only if they apply
for a reassessment.
	   Speaking at the authority's annual special meeting, chairman
Rosanna Wong Yick-ming said the authority was proposing to reassess
the rent for the leases signed or renewed when the property market
was at its peak.
	   The period referred to was between 1 January 1996 and 31 January
this year.
	   The aim of the move is to ease the financial hardship of owners
of businesses whose leases are up for renewal from next year.
	   Back in January, the Housing Department took a similar step by
allowing a one-year freeze on rents.
	   That applied to owners of businesses whose leases were up for
renewal this year. The concession was estimated to have cost the
authority $29 million.
	   The rent cut proposal will be discussed by the Commercial
Properties Committee of the authority today.
	   Ms Wong said the reassessment would only be carried out on the
request of individual tenants.
	   The Housing Authority (HA) would decide the size of the rent
cuts for individual shops, she added.
	   Applications for reassessment will probably be accepted between
July and September.
	   Ms Wong said she expected the new rents could be backdated to
July.
	   She estimated more than 9,200 business owners would benefit from
the new measure.
	   Ms Wong explained a reassessment would be fairer than a rigid
standard rent cut for all tenants because different factors like
the location of the shops and the nature of the businesses would
also be taken into consideration.
	   The Housing Department has recorded $52.6 million in uncollected
rent from its commercial premises between October last year and
March.
	   A total of 204 tenants withdrew from their tenancies in the
six-month period.
	   Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong Shing-wah said the proposed
rent cut could help relieve the financial burden of business
owners.
	   Meanwhile HA member Michael Choi Ngai-min, managing director of
Hong Kong Property Services (Agency), said the proposal would give
tenants of private commercial premises a strong argument to bargain
with landlords for rent cuts.
	   Another member Chan Kam-man slammed the Housing Bureau for
taking over the role of the HA in deciding policy on public housing
rentals.

	   THE Government Lottery Office (GLO) plans to conduct an opinion
poll to legitimise plans to increase the number of lottery tickets
in circulation through automatic lottery dispensing machines, an
official said on Thursday.
	   GLO deputy director Chaiwat Pasokpakdi said Rajabhat Suan Dusit
Poll would complete the survey of 100,000 respondents this month to
determine public sentiment over the introduction of automatic
ticketing machines, dubbed ''huay (lottery) online''. Consumers
will be able to choose numbers and purchase tickets through the
electronic medium.
	   Chaiwat said that if introduced the new distribution system
would not affect the jobs of lottery sellers because it would
handle additional tickets on top of the 31 million in circulation
for each of the fortnightly draws.
	   He did not say how many new tickets the GLO plans to add to the
system.
	   The plan to introduce the dispensing machines, on the drawing
board since 1996, has been shelved many times because of strong
opposition from lottery vendors and academics.
	   The vendors view the plan as a threat to their jobs while
academics oppose it on the grounds that it could increase gambling.
	   Despite the protests, the GLO has steadily pushed for the
introduction of an electronic lottery system, and succeeded in
appointing a Thai-US joint venture to operate it.
	   Before the system got started, the Chavalit administration had
to suspend it following a noisy demonstration by handicapped
lottery vendors. Although the Thailand Development Research
Institute concluded that the system would not serve its purpose of
controlling lottery prices and that it would further spread
gambling, the government ruled against abolishing the distribution
contract for fear of affecting investor confidence.
	   In its latest bid to revive the plan, the GLO is following two
key government guidelines -- that the automatic lottery dispensing
machines must not have an impact on vendors' jobs and that they be
accepted by the public.

	   OWNERS of businesses in the Housing Department's shopping
centres have called for an immediate rent cut as a matter of
urgency.
	   Man Yuk-king, a tenant in Wong Tai Sin Shopping Centre,
expressed concern over the rental reassessment proposed by the
Housing Authority before the cuts are made.
	   ``It will be more practical for the government to offer us a
temporary rent cut,'' she said as she wondered how the review could
benefit her.
	   ``To be fair to the government, I am willing to pay the normal
rent when the economy improves in future.'' The owner of a
stationery business said she had been in the red since March. But
she said she was still hoping to see light at the end of the
tunnel.
	   Ms Man said the rent was now $35,000 a month for the shop of 72
square metres.
	   She estimated the rent should now be 40 per cent lower or
$20,000 a month according to current market prices.
	   She said she would not join the reassessment if it proved
expensive.
	   Another tenant, May Cheong Mei-yi, shared the same view. Ms
Cheong, who is running a beauty parlour on the third floor, said
she preferred an immediate rent cut to a reassessment.
	   Ms Cheong said her business had dropped by half since the
financial turmoil hit Hong Kong.
	   Democrat Lee Wing-tat, also a member of the authority and a
newly elected legislator, called for a 30 per cent rent cut across
the board.

EU claims WTO victory over US in computer equipment battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union claimed victory
Friday over the United States in a dispute over trade in computer
equipment.
	   In a statement, the EU executive Commission said a World Trade
Organization panel ruled Friday that relatively high tariffs in
Britain and Ireland on imports of U.S. computer network equipment
were compatible with WTO rules.
	   The case involves dlrs 467.5 million worth of U.S.
telecommunications equipment exports to the EU, the statement said.
The United States complained to the WTO in 1996 about 1995
decisions by Britain and Ireland to raise tariffs on these imports.
	   In February, a WTO panel ruled in favor of the United States but

	   THE Election Commission, at the national and local levels, will
be the sole authority to organise, administer and supervise future
elections, while civil servants, previously in charge of the polls,
will assume a role on the sidelines, EC member Yuwarat Kamolvej
said on Thursday.
	   Yuwarat, speaking at a seminar for provincial officials about
new electoral rules mandated by the new Constitution, reminded
government officials they have an important duty to facilitate
voting although they are no longer in charge of the elections.
	   ''Provincial and local officials are the core staff to ensure
smooth casting of votes, but the public will not tolerate it if
they interfere to fix the election outcome,'' he said.
	   He pointed out that political reforms, including changes in
electoral rules, were aimed at staging free and fair elections and
doing away with money politics.
	   He called for government officials, especially interior
authorities, to render their utmost cooperation to run a clean
election and absolve themselves from past public criticism that
they had acted as vote canvassers.
	   The EC member emphasised that although the EC will oversee the
polls, it had to rely on about 1 million officials mobilised from
various agencies to help run the polling stations. Police will be
in charge of public safety; interior officials in charge of
administrative works; transport officials in charge of moving
ballot boxes; and postmen in charge of delivering absentee votes,
he said.
	   He also mentioned that although the drawing of 400
constituencies would take some time, the EC was empowered to speed
up the process if there should be a snap election.

	   ROME (AP) _ The European Union intends to send a ``very clear
and very strong'' message to Yugoslavia that peace must be restored
in Kosovo, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday.
	   Britain currently hold the rotating presidency of the EU and
Blair spoke to reporters in Rome after talks with Premier Romano
Prodi.
	   Many fear the explosive situation in Kosovo could lead to
another Balkan war.
	   ``We are well aware of the fact that we can't allow the
situation to develop as we did in Bosnia,'' Blair said. ``We are
examining every possible option.''
	   He said the EU intends to send ``a very clear and very strong
message'' that it wants stability in the region.
	   ``It would be a very serious mistake for people to underestimate
our resolve and determination,'' he said.
	   Tens of thousands of people have fled a fierce Serbs offensive
in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the population. About 12,000 refugees have already
reached Albania and as many as 7,000 others have made it to
Montenegro.
	   Serbia and much smaller Montenegro are the only republics left
in the Yugoslav federation.

	   In his remarks delivered before the recent meeting of Apec
finance ministers in Canada, Sarasin Viraphol proposed policies to
encourage a recovery of private capital inflows to Asia.
	   ASIA is unlikely to witness a repeat of the extraordinary
private capital flows during the decade preceding the current
financial crisis in the region anytime soon, particularly given the
ongoing prospect of Japanese deflation, growing signs of further
economic contraction elsewhere in Asia, and the sustained American
economic boom which has absorbed much of the world capital. In
fact, the IMF predicts that for 1998, net private capital flows to
the affected Asian economies, namely Thailand, South Korea and
Indonesia, will be zero, while that to China will also decline
significantly.
	   The next round of capital flows into Asia, when it occurs, will
mainly depend on how the regional economies are able to inspire
confidence regarding their ability in expeditiously and effectively
dealing with the unprecedented economic crisis and setting clear
directions. Notwithstanding the resultant severe outback in their
growth, these economies have demonstrated their readiness to move
ahead with the globalisation processes, for which they have
benefitted and suffered. While the cycle of boom and bust is a
normal economic occurrence, the one Asia has been confronting is
seen as directly caused by excesses associated with the new
phenomenon of globalisation -- which the erstwhile frenzied pace of
capital flows is one distinct manifestation.
	   It may be relevant to recap the tale of Asia's boom and bust
here. In the heyday of the Asian boom, particularly during the
first half of the 1990s, private capital, encouraged by the
requirement of Asian economies to grow rapidly, was flowing in
profusion into the region's ''real sector'' -- especially in
manufacturing -- as well as speculative sector, seeking rich
returns on interest and exchange rates. But excessive investment in
various business ventures often hastily generated from the regional
bourses or financed by short-term loans -- so-called ''hot money''
-- subsequently strained the capacity of the region's financial
market, leading to the ignominious burst, the flight of external
private capital, and leaving Asia saddled with hundreds of billions
of dollars in private debts.
	   Now 10 months into the Asian financial crisis, the general
picture of the corporate health in the region remains precarious
and is showing signs of further deterioration. Corporate
bankruptcies are now increasing steadily as tight liquidity and
high interest rates are now familiar features in the affected
regional economic landscape.
	   In such a dire situation, a requisite for the return of private
capital flows is the encouragement and facilitation of foreign
participation in trade and investment among the concerned Asian
economies.
	   This may smack of heresy to those who regard the present
economic turmoil as a direct result of over liberalisation, of the
overexposure to external capital flows. According to this
nationalist sentiment, to advocate further indiscriminate
liberalisation would be tantamount to calling for the surrender of
one's autonomy and sovereignty.
	   The truth is the rapidly-growing Asian economies have long
forfeited their ''independence'' in international economic
transactions when they opted for globalisation and went on to
achieve fame with ''Asian miracle'' during the past decades. As has
subsequently been discovered, the new liberalised economic
environment has -- as would be expected under other different
circumstances -- its benefit and cost.
	   Among the emerging market economies of Asia that won
international accolades for their ''miracle growth'', more often
than not one would find businesses that were highly leveraged with
the readily-available external capital. Without fully appreciating
the implications of the new economic order with its stress on rapid
and high-yield growth, governments and enterprises alike threw
caution to the wind and pursued expansion with a vengeance.
	   Under these circumstances then, the affected economies need to
examine a number of policies and measures which the Asian
governments may consider adopting in meeting the challenge of
encouraging the return of private capital flows.
	   First, expeditious structural reforms of the financial sector
are essential. Laws, regulations, procedures and practices aimed at
inducing foreign participation in the manners of equity or
management must be urgently implemented. The restructuring of the
many troubled finance companies will involve the foreclosure laws
being put in place. Thailand has enacted the long-awaited
bankruptcy law for facilitating the resolution of failed
enterprises along the line of the similar US legislation. This move
should bring benefits to the creditor and the debtor. The country
has also facilitated full foreign participation in its financial
sector, which would permit a full takeover of a troubled finance
company or bank, albeit for a limited period of time. Further
liberalisation measures should be instituted to include the
issuance of new banking licences to prospective foreign banks
seeking to set up in Thailand. Such a practice would help Thailand
meet the challenges of globalisation of the financial business in
terms of infusions of fresh capital and management technology. And
that is not to mention benefits befalling clients and customers of
the Thai financial sector.
	   Second, the revival of the imploded property sector is a matter
of great urgency. It is sad legacy that the frenzied property
development, especially over the past decade, has resulted in the
massive creation of outstanding debts. One effective way of
inducing private capital from abroad is to further liberalise
foreign ownership of commercial and residential buildings. Hence,
such legislation as the 40 per cent ownership limit of
condominiums, the one-rai ownership of land, and the 30-year limit
on leaseholds of commercial buildings, should be reviewed. Foreign
property developers are willing to purchase office complexes even
on a temporary basis through an arrangement of continual
rental/occupation and an eventual buy-back by their original
owners. It is important to remind oneself that in such cases, the
observance of local laws remains paramount.
	   Third, serious efforts must be made to reform the inefficient
and corrupt bureaucracy. The bureaucracy's role is too vital to the
recovery and eventual growth of the national economy to be
overlooked. The attractiveness of a career in the bureaucracy must
be enhanced, which should include more attractive incentives such
as adequate remuneration. In an increasingly globalised
environment, the bureaucracy must be sensitised about growing
competition as well as accountability. Efficiency, integrity, and a
sense of pride in, and dedication to, work for the public are
indispensable qualities. Bureaucratic efficiency and integrity is
essential for assuring the proper operation and management of
foreign capital at least from the perspective that the bureaucracy
will not be adversely intrusive.
	   Fourth, promoting exports will inevitably induce the flow of
capital. Much of the growth of the Asian economies over the past
decade is attributable to the dedication to export-led
manufacturing by both the government and private sector. At this
juncture when reliance on export is greater than before, it would
be imperative for the government to provide adequate export
financing -- including loans to purchase raw materials and packing
credits to exporters -- and facilitate export procedures.
	   Now that agriculture-led exports appear to be Thailand's mettle,
the Thai government should undertake necessary measures --
including providing farmers/growers and exporters with attractive
incentives and fewer impediments. In this respect, the Thai
government could eventually use some of the projected Bt70-billion
bonds to be floated in Thailand and abroad over the next several
months for this purpose, which would invariably benefit the welfare
of most Thais who work in the agricultural sector as well. In
addition, the government's efforts to maintain reasonable currency
exchange and interest rates will enable agribusiness exporters to
secure necessary capital in order to export and generate the
much-needed revenue from abroad.
	   The projections about the zero net inflows of private capital to
the affected Asian economies, and the anticipated severe
contraction of growth throughout the region for 1998 will aggravate
corporate bankruptcies and worsen the unemployment situation with
major social implications. In 1998, Thailand is facing the prospect
of a negative economic growth projected at 5-6 per cent, and an
unemployment pool of more than three million. In such a situation,
the primacy of restoring private capital flows back to the region
cannot be emphasised enough. The government and corporate sector,
therefore, must work together to lower and eliminate barriers to
trade and investment in a new nexus of mutual interests. By way of
an analogy, it behooves the Asian countries to try to adjust the
railway gauge of their respective economies to conform with the
standard gauge of the globalised economies, so that the train of
development may run on one harmonised track.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Inland Revenue Board cannot disclose
matters pertaining to investigations of defaulting taxpayers or
whether those who bought properties beyond their means had declared
their taxes correctly as these are confidential.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Wong See Wah said this when asked
by reporters whether the board will investigate former Selangor
Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib who recently admitted
that he had bought properties in Australia and New Zealand under
his wife's name.
	   The Income Tax Act 1967 empowers the board to investigate
individuals, among others, who buy luxury cars or properties beyond
their means to see if these individuals had declared their income
tax correctly.
	   ``The Inland Revenue (Board) knows what to do ... the law
applies to all,'' he told reporters after launching the IRB's new
logo at the Jalan Duta Government Complex.
	   Last week, Anti-Corruption Agency director-general Datuk Shafee
Yahaya said it had completed part of its investigation of Muhammad,
which started the moment Muhammad was detained for failing to
declare more than A$1.2 million (RM2.95 million) when he left
Brisbane International Airport on Dec 26, 1996.
	   The Brisbane District Court had last Friday, acquitted Muhammad
on two charges of falsely declaring the money he took into
Australia in December 1996 and failing to declare more than A$1.2
million when he left the country.
	   During his trial, Muhammad told the court that he had used his
wife's name, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Hasnan, to purchase assets in
Australia and New Zealand.
	   This included a plot of land valued at A$460,000 and a A$460,000
bungalow at Sovereign Island, Gold Coast; a farm in Currajong
valued at A$3.7 million, a NZ$500,000 house (RM1.05 million) and
two plots of land valued at about NZ$4 million in New Zealand.
	   Asked whether the IRB will work with the ACA to pursue
investigations against Muhammad, Wong said: ``I think we should let
them (Inland Revenue Board) do the job.''
	   Citing an example, Wong said the IRB had also queried him on
income tax matters previously.
	   On another note, Wong said the IRB will not investigate
individuals who bring in money from overseas following the move by
the Government to allow them to do so two weeks ago.
	   This, he said, means that these individuals need not declare
these monies when submitting their income tax documents to the
board for assessment.
	   Wong said those interested are given until Dec 31 to bring in
the monies.
	   Asked if action would be taken if there was proof that those who
had taken the money out of the country earlier were now
contemplating to bring it back, he said: ``We are not bothered from
where or how they had obtained the money. The IRB will not
investigate.''
	   He said the money brought in will help increase liquidity in the
market and this will help the country tide over this difficult
period.
	   He said the ministry has, so far, received about 30 queries from
people wishing to bring in their monies from overseas.
	   ``There is an individual who wishes to bring back about RM20
million. The others have between half a million and one million
ringgit,'' he said.
	   Wong said the Government was also glad that the IRB has managed
to collect RM10.3 billion in the first four months of this year
compared to RM9.1 billion in the same corresponding period of last
year.
	   He congratulated the IRB for having collected higher taxes
despite the anticipated reduction in collection due to the economic
slowdown.
	   Earlier in his speech, Wong said the Finance Ministry has
received 232 applications from companies and individuals seeking to
reschedule their tax payments.
	   He said of these 104 were individuals, businesses (78),
companies (48), and property gains tax (two). Together, they owed
the IRB RM36.7 million.
	   Wong said the IRB has also recovered RM117 million after
investigating 209 cases in the first four months of this year.
	   In the same corresponding period last year, the board recovered
RM210.3 million after solving 193 cases.
	   Also present at the launch of the new logo were Treasury
secretary- general Datuk Dr Aris Othman, who is also IRB chairman
and IRB chief executive officer Najirah Mohd Tassaduk Khan.

	   OWNERS of apartments and households in many Bangkok districts
have complained about the Metropolitan Electricity Authority's call
for them to pay their power bills in advance, saying the demand is
unfair given the economic situation.
	   In letters sent to them since February, the MEA says they must
pay an amount equivalent to twice their average monthly bills in
advance. It calls the extra figure ''a deposit for future fees''
which it claims is necessary to prevent loss of income if power
users move and leave their power bills unpaid.
	   It promises to return the money after power users give up their
right to power or transfer their right to others.
	   Defending the much-maligned policy, MEA's Bang Khen district
office chief Samit Nilphai said the MEA had lost several hundred
millions of baht in uncollected bills after residents moved out
without giving the MEA notice.
	   Samit said the fee has been on the books for several years but
never enforced because the ratio of power consumption was low in
the past.
	   Asked about the MEA's demand, Sirithat Klankhwamdee, a
Provincial Electricity Authority assistant governor, said he had no
comment but added he thought the MEA is probably having financial
and cash flow problems.

	   FINANCIAL Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has come under
increasing pressure to raise public spending in a bid to stimulate
the economy.
	   Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong chief Tsang
Yok-sing urged Sir Donald yesterday to relax his stance and post a
deficit budget.
	   Mr Tsang said he believed the people would not mind increased
spending if it was necessary for the revival of the economy.
	   The DAB legislator said the Financial Secretary should abandon
his strict interpretation of Article 107 of the Basic Law, which
forbids overspending by the government.
	   Mr Tsang said letting government expenditure increase at a pace
faster than the gross domestic product growth rate would not
violate the SAR's mini-constitution.
	   Deficit spending was necessary in times of economic recession,
he stressed.
	   Increasing government expenditure means the government should
either raise taxes or prepare for a deficit budget, Mr Tsang said,
adding that he ``believed the people would be more ready to accept
a deficit''.
	   But the pro-Beijing party leader admitted that a deficit budget
would have adverse effects on the international community's
confidence in Hong Kong as it would think the SAR was abandoning
its traditionally prudent fiscal policies.
	   He stressed, though: ``This is a very special time and we have
to make a choice between two undesirable alternatives.'' Article
107 of the Basic Law stipulates that ``Hong Kong shall follow the
principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in
drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance,
avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the growth
rate of its gross domestic product''.
	   The DAB stressed that the term ``commensurate'' did not indicate
whether the growth rate of expenditure should be higher or lower
than GDP growth.
	   Mr Tsang said his party also believed the economy would improve
in the near future, which means the rise in expenditure would not
exceed GDP growth.
	   As the government's method of calculating GDP growth was based
on a specific period of time, it would be inappropriate to restrict
the rise in expenditure to a year's GDP growth, he said. Mr Tsang
hoped government expenditure would be used to create jobs to help
the unemployed.
	   Independent newly re-elected legislator Eric Li Ka-cheng, from
the Accountancy constituency, also proposed a deficit budget last
week by introducing a ``hardship-easing tax return'' measure.
	   This suggests allowing firms that suffer losses this year and
individuals who lose their jobs to claim back taxes paid in the
previous two years from the government to help ease their hardship.

	   IPOH, Wed. - The High Court today upheld the decision of a lower
court to sentence former electronics plant assembly employee Chow
Chung Neng to four years' jail after he was found guilty of
reckless driving which resulted in the deaths of seven people last
year.
	   Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee, after hearing submissions from the
defence and prosecution, said Sessions Court Judge Abdul Aziz
Khaliddin, who sat as magistrate, did not err when he arrived at
the decision.
	   ``Seven lives were lost and two people were seriously injured.
As a result of the accident, one of the injured women who was four
months' pregnant had a miscarriage,'' he said when dismissing the
appeal against sentence and conviction by Chow.
	   Chow, who had been serving his jail sentence from March 6,
appeared calm and composed when Kang dismissed his appeal.
	   The lower court on March 6 (this year) also ordered Chow's
driving licence be suspended for 10 years.
	   Chow, 28, was convicted under section 41(1) of the Road
Transport Act 1987. He committed the offence at 7.20am on March 31,
last year at KM9.5 Jalan Ipoh-Chemor.
	   The crash caused the deaths of workers Sodma Othman, 39, N.
Suppamah, 45, N. Ramlai Dewi, 37, Kung Mooy Lan, 40, S. Walliamah,
36, Liew Ah Kan, 34, and Rukibah Lop, 37.
	   The offence is punishable with a jail term of up to five years
or a maximum fine of RM10,000 or both.
	   Defence counsel C.K. Leong earlier submitted that the magistrate
had erred in law as nobody witnessed the accident.
	   Leong said the magistrate was also wrong in rejecting the
evidence of two defence witnesses who testified that Chow was an
epileptic. He said Chow was in a state of epilepsy when he was
driving the car on the fateful day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chew
Soo Ho said Chow was reckless as adduced evidence showed that he
(Chow) was travelling at high speed.

	   SEREMBAN, Wed. - The total amount of quit rent collected in the
state for the year ending May 31, 1998 has dropped to RM46.43
million compared with RM60.9 million the previous year.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad said today the figure
was 48.72 per cent of the actual amount supposed to be collected
from landowners.
	   Landowners who had not paid their quit rent were advised to do
so, he told reporters after chairing the State Exco meeting here.
	   Mohd Isa said there was no reason for landowners to delay paying
the quit rent since the deadline was May 31 for each year.
	   He said land premium collection had dropped by half from the
RM44 million collected the previous year.

	   SENIOR educators and researchers in the Asia-Pacific travel and
tourism industry will be meeting in Chon Buri on Monday and Tuesday
to strengthen the institutional capabilities of regional tourism
training, education and research institutes.
	   The conference at the Hotel and Tourism Training Institute of
the Tourism Authority of Thailand will be the first for the
executive committee of the Network of Asia-Pacific Education and
Training Institutes in Tourism (APETIT).
	   Now comprising educational institutions from 23 Asia-Pacific
countries, APETIT was set up at a meeting in Tehran last September
to address the significant lack of travel and tourism training,
research and education infrastructure as well as qualified
educators and trainers.
	   Participants at the Tehran meeting recognised that the
Asia-Pacific industry could benefit substantially through sharing
of experiences, ideas, expertise and skills among institutes and
organisations in other countries with common interests.
	   The founding members of APETIT considered that regional
co-operation could be achieved most effectively and successfully in
the form of a network.
	   The establishment of APETIT was well received and drew strong
support from developing and developed countries in Asia-Pacific.
Its creation was considered timely and significant in terms of
Asia-Pacific co-operation.
	   At its meeting in Bang Saen of Chon Buri, the network will be
formally introducing its new Internet website that lists all the
member training and education institutes and creates a database on
courses offered, entrance requirements, contact names and
facilities.
	   It will also be looking to finalise other activities like
regional training programmes, workshops and seminars, exchanging
internship students, and look at opportunities for doing advanced
research and studies.

Witnesses, paparazzi, Al Fayed converge on Paris courthouse
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with interrogation of photographer.

  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Friday brought together for the
first time the main parties in the Diana investigation to try to
finally clarify the role of the photographers in the crash.
	   Grouped together were the photographers under investigation in
the case; eight witnesses to the crash; Mohamed Al Fayed; and,
according to defense lawyers in the room, Diana's mother, Frances
Shand Kydd. They were accompanied by a platoon of lawyers.
	   Judge Herve Stephan was trying to find out whether it was a
simple car accident, caused by a drunk driver.
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her
companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But what was the responsibility of the paparazzi trailing
Diana's Mercedes that night? Nine photographers and one press
motorcyclist have been placed under investigation _ a step short of
being formally charged. They have remained in legal limbo for
almost a year, continuing their work.
	   In what was seen as a last-ditch effort to clarify their roles,
Stephan was questioning each photographer one by one.
	   Lawyers emerging from the courtroom described the process. Two
hours into the hearing, the judge had already dealt with two
photographers: Romuald Rat and Stephane Darmon. Each gave an
account of their activities that night. The judge then questioned
them, questioned witnesses as to what they had seen, then opened
questions to other lawyers.
	   According to lawyers in the room, Rat also was harshly
questioned by lawyers for Al Fayed, who tried to establish he
pursued the Mercedes that night.
	   ``I followed it. I did not pursue it,'' Rat responded, according
to lawyers.
	   Stepping outside for a break, Al Fayed, Dodi's father, would say
only: ``It's going fine. Great judge.''
	   He is a civil party in the case, meaning he has access to
documents and proceedings. Diana's mother was also there but said
nothing, said lawyer Virginie Bardet.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   ``It's very well organized. It's calm, thorough, and clear. I am
persuaded it will serve a purpose,'' said lawyer Jean-Louis
Pelletier, who represents photographers David Ker and Fabrice
Chassery.
	   The policemen said during the hearing Rat hindered their work,
lawyers said on condition of anonymity.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many close to the case believe they will soon be exonerated, at
least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,'' said
Arsov. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have to do their
job.''
	   Arsov was supposed to be shooting pictures Friday at the French
Open tennis tournament.
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily guarded by police.
	   Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a Mercedes,
surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   His spokesman, Lawrie Meyer, said ``This is a process to decide
if the paparazzi should go to trial.''
	   Mr. Al Fayed ``is still a grieving parent and is here to find
out what happened to his son,'' he said.
	   In a statement issued in London on Thursday, Al Fayed said he
was ``determined to get to the truth'' about whether the crash was
an accident or a plot to kill Diana and his son.
	   French judicial sources said recently Al Fayed has backed off
his contention that the crash stemmed from a plot, and now blames
the paparazzi.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   Investigators also recently conducted road tests on a race track
near Paris to reconstruct the crash. Police revealed no details of
those tests.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

Court throws out demand for ticket redistribution
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with court comment showing it appears to back
complaint but can't rule; parliamentarians say individuals can seek
redress  
  By RAF CASERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A court on Friday suggested a demand by a group of
European lawmakers to redistribute World Cup tickets they claim
were unfairly allocated to French fans was not unfounded, but threw
out the case on technical grounds.
	   The court said that under French law there can be no class
action suit involving the tickets.
	   The group of 32 European Parliament deputies had sought to have
700,000 tickets redistributed. The soccer championships start June
10 and run to July 12. They claimed the way was now open for
individuals to file suits for tickets.
	   ``The distribution system is likely to affect the rights of the
ensemble of citizens of the (European) Community,'' the court said.
	   It noted that the largest part of the tickets was reserved for
``French citizens, groups and businesses ... with an address on
French national territory,'' but said it could not rule in the
case.
	   ``It was thrown out on a technical grounds. The court has not
dealt with the matter as such,'' said Phillip Jenkinson, attorney
for the lawmakers.
	   To take the ticket matter to court, one can only seek tickets
for oneself, Jenkinson said, explaining the court's decision to
throw out the case.
	   ``The way is open for other challenges from EU citizens,'' said
Luc Misson, for 32, ``the court said that the access was not
equitable to all the fans.''
	   `We are one nil down at half-time, but the courts have given us
a penalty,'' said Graham Watson, of the Liberal Democrats of
Britain, referring to the possibility for citizens to seek redress
individually.

	   UNIVERSITIES will have to struggle to make ends meet to comply
with the government's request to expand post-graduate courses by 20
per cent, a leading university head said.
	   Vice-Chancellor Arthur Li Kwok-cheung of the Chinese University
of Hong Kong (CUHK) said his institution would have to dig into
private funds and internal resources as the University Grants
Committee (UGC) was unlikely to fund the extra places.
	   ``We are willing to support the government,'' Mr Li said.
	   ``However, it's not a matter of one more set of desks and chairs
when it comes to teaching post-graduate students.
	   ``We need more quality lecturers to teach quality students, but
the government has not promised us more money.
	   ``If we're to support the proposal, we will have to reallocate
internal resources and pull out private funds.'' Prof Li said the
university might be left holding the bag.
	   ``During the good times, the government has cut our funding by
10 per cent, whereas during the bad times, we are asked to pay our
own bill,'' he said.
	   ``I'm worried that the government will not reimburse us even
when the economy revives.'' It costs $20,000 a year to teach a
post-graduate student.
	   The expansion is one of the measures unveiled by Financial
Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen to create more jobs.
	   Under the plan, there will be 1,000 additional places for
post-graduate courses in tertiary institutions this year.
	   In a letter issued to all local higher education institutions,
the UGC urged the school heads to ``consider and implement the
proposal urgently''.
	   They are given two weeks to decide what faculties should be
granted the additional places. The new programs will start this
autumn.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Wed. - Minister in the Chief Minister's
Department Datuk Yong Teck Lee will oversee the State Economic
Planning Unit.
	   Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok said Yong would also be
required to perform certain functions from time to time.
	   ``The EPU does short-term and long-term planning for the State
Government and Yong will be placed there at the moment,'' Dompok
said.
	   The State EPU is under the Chief Minister's Department and its
director is Wong Kee Bun.
	   Speaking at the State Legislative Assembly building in Likas
after chairing his first weekly Cabinet meeting today, Dompok said
no decision had been made on who would replace Datuk Abdul Ghapur
Salleh as Deputy Chief Minister-cum-Finance Minister.
	   Ghapur had requested to be excluded from the State Cabinet
line-up announced by Dompok on May 28 after he (Dompok) took over
as Chief Minister from Yong under the rotation system.
	   On comments by the Opposition that it was a waste of public
funds to appoint Yong as Minister in the Chief Minister's
Department, Dompok said in the eyes of the Opposition, the
Government never did right.
	   ``The Opposition will have to say something. What is more
important is what the Government delivers to the people. How can it
be a waste of funds when I have not increased the number of
Ministries,'' Dompok asked, adding that there were still 10
Ministries and not 11 with Yong's appointment.

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi will fly to Japan in August to ask for an additional
loan from the Japan Import-Export Bank, a Commerce Ministry
official said.
	   JXIM has already extended a US$600 million loan to Thailand to
strengthen exports, which is being re-lent through the Thai
Import-Export Bank and the Industrial Finance Corporation of
Thailand.
	   Meanwhile, the Commerce Ministry plans to meet with the Japanese
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) to gain the
remaining $230 million export guarantee loan, which is due to
terminate in October.
	   Thailand has received a $1 billion export guarantee loan package
from Miti for four major steel and electronic manufacturers.
	   The official said Supachai will also urge Miti to help boost
Japanese imports of Thai goods after the first quarter saw a
significant drop of 15.3 per cent.
	   In addition, the commerce minister will increase efforts to
encourage Japanese investors and multinational companies to set up
their production bases here and invest in the local capital market.
	   Supachai said that despite a decline in the Japanese market and
continued economic gloom, Japan remains a potential market for
exports.
	   The official said the Commerce Ministry recently urged the
central Bank of Thailand to urgently ease the liquidity shortage
facing exporters, especially small and medium-sized industries.
Seeking further foreign loans would be one means of supporting
exporters. According to the fourth letter of intent signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Thailand's export growth this
year is expected to be minus 1.2 per cent. Earlier, the Commerce
Ministry set the export target at 7 per cent growth, but later
adjusted the figure down to 1 to 2 per cent.

	   A crucial decision lies ahead for finance authorities on when
and how interest rates should be brought down, the Finance Desk
reports.
	   THE time bomb is ticking as the worsening economic situation
tightens its grip on coporate Thailand. Local firms are sinking
like the Titanic. But the ''Thai-tanic'' could be salvaged if the
government makes a right decision to cut interest rates.
	   MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
the move hinges mainly on market mechanism and the period of time,
after a meeting between key finance officials and the country's
think-tank, Thailand Development and Research Institute (TDRI), on
the issue.
	   ''Everyone agreed in principle with TDRI's proposal, but when
and how remain big questions.'' ''I understand the TDRI tries to do
the best thing for the country. But it still don't understand how
the market works,'' he said.
	   Chatu Mongol was referring to the dollar/baht exchange rates and
inflationary pressure, the two crucial factors in any decision to
slash interest rates.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, speaking at a symposium
in Tokyo recently, said he would not hesitate to tighten monetary
policy should there be increased pressure on the exchange rate.
	   He noted that the Finance Ministry is in the process of
''cautiously easing monetary policy,'' increasing money supply and
allowing growth in monetary reserve.
	   The TDRI, led by president Anand Panyarachun, proposed to the
economic team that fiscal and monetary policies should be mixed,
giving some breathing space to cash-strapped companies.
	   Former deputy prime minister Virabongsa Ramangkura, one of the
TDRI delegation, said the government should pump a massive amount
of money into the system, given an adequate amount of foreign
reserves.
	   ''Such a move will help raise exports, boost liquidity, rekindle
foreign investments and increased purchasing power, and also lead
to a reduction of interest rates,'' a source quoted Anand as
saying.
	   Analysts said that printing new money will accelerate the rate
of inflation.
	   According to the source, Virabongsa admitted that the negative
impact of such a measure is a depreciation of the baht against the
US dollar. ''But it is still acceptable if the baht does not fall
beyond Bt45 to the greenback,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Dru Narwani, chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Bank,
agreed that a range of Bt42-Bt45 per dollar is appropriate as the
regional economic environment remains unfavourable.
	   The baht yesterday declined to Bt42.60 against the US dollar
from Wednesday's close of Bt42.20, its lowest level in 12 weeks.
	   Despite the baht weakness, analysts said that the government
cannot adopt a 'buy-time' strategy in cutting interest rates as
most of companies are in a 'life-and-death' situation due to the
severe shortage of liquidity.
	   ''If they [the government] are afraid to bring down interest
rates or postpone their decision, most companies would be dead.
There is not much time left. This boils down to whether you should
save currency or let the country die,'' an analyst of a leading
local securities house said.
	   But Chatu Mongol does not think so. He said that a cut in
interest rates may lead to a deterioration of foreign investor
confidence given the region's economic problems.
	   Thailand's miracle economy lurched into a crisis as a result of
the baht flotation last year when foreign capital started flowing
out of the country. Offshore money was a major force to country's
economic growth in the past. ''We cannot live with that [capital
outflows],'' Chatu Mongol said.
	   He admitted that the country is going through a difficult period
and Thai companies need to consolidate to strengthen their
financial position.
	   So far, there has been no answer when interest rates will be
reduced as companies close down one after the other. The reality is
when the government decides on a reduction, there might be no
company left to save.

Fourteen kilograms of heroin seized at Yugoslav-Bulgarian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -Yugoslav border authorities seized 14
kilograms (31 pounds) of heroin late Thursday at a border crossing
with neighboring Bulgaria, the state news agency Tanjug reported
Friday.
	   The alleged smuggler, identified as Ahmet Remzi, an ethnic
Albanian living in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, reportedly
bought the drug in Istanbul, Turkey, and hid it in his Russian-made
Lada sedan.
	   Remzi was arrested at the border crossing of Gradina in
southeastern Serbia. He reportedly said he expected to earn about
dlrs 600 per kilogram by selling the drug to traffickers in Kosovo
who would have taken it to western Europe.

	   A PUBLICITY campaign will be launched soon to raise the
awareness among local computer users of the problem and prevention
of the potentially devastating Y2K millennium bug.
	   When 1999 becomes 2000, most computers will turn their two-digit
internal clocks back to 00, causing conflicts with date-dependant
programs.
	   ``Seventy per cent of businesses have no idea that the
millennium bug exists,'' according to Daniel Lai, president of the
Hong Kong Computer Society and acting director of Information
Technology of the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
	   ``So the Industry Department has provided $70,000 in funds for
the development of millennium bug awareness.'' The campaign will
involve an educational video and CD-rom that will explain to small
to medium-size businesses, the nature of the computer glitch.
	   According to computer programmer and consultant Red
Reid-Pitcher, the millennium bug is not going to pose that much of
a problem to the technologically advanced SAR.
	   He believes the problem can be rectified on three levels.
	   ``The millennium bug is just a technical glitch, which can be
easily solved.'' He states that the first area of concern is
non-compliant computer chips.
	   ``People just have to check with manufacturers of their hardware
to see if they need to replace their chips.'' The second is
store-bought and in-house software.
	   ``Again, people with old programs such as Office 4.5 or Windows
3.1 have to call the software companies or programmers to see if
their software is compliant.'' Mr Reid-Pitcher said software
companies were likely to replace non-compliant products with
improved copies.
	   The third and ``most difficult'' area is the administration
aspect. ``In large networks of hundreds of computers, all the
computers must be checked for the bug.'' He believes computer chips
in some home appliances and cars will be affected but disagrees
that a global computer meltdown will occur on New Year's Eve 1999
because most companies will solve the problem by then.
	   ``But you won't see me on any planes on New Year's Eve,'' he
said.

IOC president to push for change in Olympic soccer format
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN WILSON  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The head of the International Olympic
Committee said Friday he will urge the next FIFA president to drop
the under-23 format for Olympic soccer and open up the competition
to all the world's best players.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he will discuss
scrapping the restrictions with the winner of next Monday's FIFA
presidential election in Paris.
	   Lennart Johansson, head of the European federation UEFA, and
FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter are the two candidates to
succeed outgoing president Joao Havelange.
	   ``This is something we have in our agenda _ to discuss with the
new president the possibility to increase the number of players
without the age limit,'' Samaranch said.
	   FIFA, eager to guard the supremacy of its World Cup, has
restricted the Olympic soccer competition to players under the age
of 23 _ resulting in what amounts to an amateur or youth
tournament.
	   The rule was relaxed for the 1996 Atlanta Games and the 2000
Sydney Games to allow teams to field three players over 23.
	   ``Maybe this figure can be increased,'' Samaranch said. ``Our
dream is to have an open football tournament, but we think we need
some years to (achieve) this aim.''
	   Samaranch said the IOC enjoyed close relations with FIFA and
Havelange, a Brazilian who has been an IOC member since 1963.
	   ``We are sure the next president will follow the same way and
that relations with the IOC will be very friendly,'' he said.
	   On a related matter, Samaranch said he plans to appoint the next
FIFA president as an IOC member.
	   ``FIFA is maybe the most important federation in the world,'' he
said. ``To have the president of FIFA inside the IOC is something
we would like to have.''
	   Samaranch spoke at a news conference at the close of a joint
meeting of the IOC executive board and the Association of National
Olympic Committees, which represents the world's 198 national
governing bodies.
	   Samaranch repeated his message, delivered earlier this week to
the U.S. Olympic Committee, that American athletes must improve
their medal performance to ensure the success of the 2002 Winter
Games in Salt Lake City.
	   The United States won 13 medals, including six gold, at the
Nagano Games in February. The total matched the best ever U.S.
performance at a winter games but was still below expectations.
	   ``All the home teams must get good results, because if not, the
people they are very much disappointed,'' Samaranch said. ``We
reminded the USOC ... they must have an effort to improve their
results. The results were good results but maybe they must be
excellent, not only good.''
	   Samaranch also virtually ruled out the possibility of adding
women's ski jumping for the Salt Lake Games, saying the event has
not yet been established on a world-class level.
	   ``The Olympic Games can not be an experiment,'' he said. ``The
event must be tested in world championships. Many countries must
have participation. I think it's too early for this event.''
	   On an issue affecting the 2000 Sydney Games, Samaranch said the
IOC was powerless to stop price gouging by hotels which are not
contracted by the local organizing committee.
	   A delegate at this week's meetings complained that three-star
hotels in Sydney could charge up to dlrs 550 a night for a room.
	   ``That is the market,'' Samaranch said. ``The market is free. We
can do nothing. We can only ask to respect the prices for the
Olympic family. I'm sure these prices will be respected.''
	   On doping, Samaranch said the IOC could not force international
federations to carry out year-round drug testing programs, and he
ruled out calls for sports to be thrown out of the Olympics unless
they comply.
	   ``We are doing our best to convince them,'' Samaranch said.
``The most important federations are doing their best. We will
follow this way. To say you must do this or you are not in the
Olympics, that is not the way to do things. We prefer to convince,
not to impose.''
	   Samaranch sided with the national Olympic committees in their
dispute with international federations over who has control over
athletes' uniforms during the games. The federations have pushing
to change the Olympic Charter to give them more control.
	   ``It's very simple,'' Samaranch said. ``We have an Olympic
Charter. We have rules and we will abide by these rules.''

	   SOME of us have been fortunate to watch our mothers and
grandmothers grow old without any complaints pertaining to
menopausal symptoms. They just seemed to age gracefully.
	   In retrospect, they probably had symptoms but as prevailing
culture and customs demanded, they must have just suffered in
silence.
	   But times have changed and women are more educated and aware.
Besides, technology and advanced medical science have given women a
better quality of life, better health and more effective treatment
for menopausal discomforts.
	   Women too, on their part, speak up, complain and ask questions
about their health.
	   Doctors say menopause is not a disorder or a disease, even
though it has several clear symptoms. It is only a time of physical
and emotional changes, and it affects all women who live up to that
age.
	   As many know, most women start to experience menopausal symptoms
between the ages of 40 and 45, although the actual menopause occurs
at about age 50.
	   As the female body ages, the ovaries become unresponsive to the
hormones produced by the pituitary gland.
	   As a result, oestrogen and progestogen (the two most important
female hormones produced by the ovaries) decrease and the menstrual
cycle becomes irregular, slows down and then ceases altogether.
	   Naturally, such important changes show themselves in a range of
symptoms (but not all of which are experienced by every woman).
	   Some of the changes that can affect women in menopause, doctors
say, are headaches, insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, irritability,
sweating, heart palpitations, depression, hot flushes, reduced sex
drive, vaginal itch and lack of secretion.
	   They can also experience urinary problem, mood swings, emotional
changes, poor sleeping patterns, pains in the joints and temper
outburts.
	   Dr Eckehard Liske, head of gynaecological endocrinology at the
medical department of pharmaceutical company Schaper  Brummer,
Salzgitter- Ringelheim, said the pattern of symptoms have been
noted to differ slightly between Caucasian and Asian women.
	   ``Headaches, dizziness, insomnia, heartbeat palpitations and
pains in joints are more common symptoms among Asians. A diet high
in soyabean content is widely believed to have generally reduced
the incidence of hot flushes and night sweats among Asian women,
which are prevalent in the majority of Caucasian women,'' said the
51-year-old German, who came to Kuala Lumpur recently.
	   Previously, the only relief from these symptoms for women here
was to undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This is the
replacement of oestrogen and progestogen through tablet intake.
	   While HRT does, no doubt, alleviate menopausal symptoms, it
poses a number of health risks.
	   ``Women on intensive HRT face a higher risk of developing breast
cancer.
	   Moreover, of concern among Muslim women, is the fact that the
oestrogenic component of HRT is mainly sourced from animal extract,
which may not be what you consider halal.''
	   Dr Liske, who has a wry sense of humour, also commented on an
article entitled Oestrogen Therapy: Should Women Go For It Despite
The Risks?
	   where author Isaac Schiff, chief of obstetrics and gynaecology
at Massachusetts general hospital, puts the HRT dilemma in a
refreshing light.
	   ``Basically, you're presenting women with the possibility of
increasing the risk of getting breast cancer at age 60, in order to
prevent a heart attack at age 70 and a hip fracture at age 80,'' he
said.
	   (HRT, while alleviating the menopausal symptoms, reduces the
risk of heart attack and bone thinning or osteoporosis, both due to
hormone deficiency. However, it apparently increases the risk of
breast cancer.) So would you rather have a quick death from heart
attack or a slow agonising death from breast cancer?
	   Fortunately, Malaysian women today have other options. There is
now a proven herbal alternative to HRT in relieving menopausal
symptoms. There is also a means of complementing HRT with the
herbal remedy enabling the use of very low dosage of hormones in
HRT.
	   In general, says Dr Liske, a lower dosage in HRT means lesser
side- effects in the future.
	   That is what many doctors are doing in Germany, he adds, and
``they are working out well''.
	   Dr Liske's visit to Kuala Lumpur recently was to meet medical
professionals here regarding this herbal remedy.
	   It is made from the roots of a plant called black cohosh
(Cimicifugae racemosa) which has its origins in North America.
	   The North American Indians used it to treat a variety of
ailments, like women's cramps, menstrual ills and menopause
problems. Then the American colonists used it further.
	   In Germany, it has been in use for more than 40 years and it has
been exported to the United States, Australia, Sweden, Luxembourg
and Switzerland, amongst others, in recent years.
	   Introduced in Singapore and Malaysia last year, it will soon be
launched in neighbouring Asian countries.
	   This black cohosh root preparation has been approved and
registered by the Ministry of Health here as a herbal medicine for
treatment of symptoms associated with menopause.
	   ``So it is safe to use and can be bought over the counter,''
says Dr Liske.
	   ``This preparation has good pharmaceutical quality, meaning,

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Tunisia's national airline began flights
to Beirut for the first time Friday.
	   A Tunisair Airbus 320 plane landed at Beirut airport at 8:30
a.m. (0530GMT), with Tunisian Transport Minister Hussein al-Shouk
and a 40-member delegation on board. They were received by Lebanese
Transport Minister Omar Miskawi.
	   Tunisair will operate a direct flight to Beirut weekly, Beirut
airport officials said.
	   Tunisair brings to 32 the number of foreign airlines flying to
Beirut. Most foreign airlines shunned Beirut airport during the
1975-90 civil war when it became a haven for hijackers and
kidnappers.

Japan railway to check axles, wheels of 1,100 bullet train cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ East Japan Railway Co. will carry out emergency
inspections of the axles and wheels on all 1,100 of its high-speed
bullet train cars following the deadly train crash in Germany, a
news report said Friday.
	   The inspections come after German federal railway authorities
confirmed that a wheel failure was the most likely cause of the
accident this week that killed at least 96 people, Kyodo News
reported.
	   East Japan Railway officials were unavailable for comment late
Friday. The inspections will be completed by Monday, the report
said.
	   Tokyo-based East Japan Railway operates three main
``Shinkansen'' lines with trains which run up to 270 kilometers
(168 miles) per hour. It is the biggest part of the former national
railway company, which was split up in 1987.
	   JR East sister companies Central Japan Railway Co. and West
Japan Railway Co. operate separate bullet train networks.
	   The two sister companies did not have immediate plans Friday for
emergency inspections of their bullet trains' axles and wheels,
Kyodo said.

	   THE first major financial study of Hong Kong's public health
service has been launched to tackle costs, which have increased
sixfold in the last 10 years.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said last night
the Domestic Health Account would be completed by the end of the
year.
	   The study, which is being carried out by experts from the
Harvard University School of Public Health, will show what
resources are available and how they are distributed.
	   Sir Donald warned that people could not carry on taking public
services for granted indefinitely.
	   He was speaking at the joint annual dinner of the Public
Doctors' Association and Government Doctors' Association. ``We must
define the level of subsidy and set it within clear boundaries
which the economy can sustain over the long term.
	   ``As our population ages and increases, with greater numbers of
people seeking treatment from the public sector, we will simply not
be able to afford it.'' He said the finance study had been launched
after figures showed that in 1988-89, the government spent $5
billion or 10.6 per cent of its total recurrent public expenditure
on health.
	   But in the current financial year, health expenditure is
estimated to be $29 billion, 14.6 per cent, of the budget, he
added.
	   Sir Donald said the elderly population was growing as people
lived longer.
	   At present, 10 per cent of the population is 65-years old or
over but by 2015, it will reach 13 per cent, he said.
	   ``Elderly people need four or five times as much medical
attention and treatment as younger people.
	   Added to this, consumers demand constant improvements in the
quality of services and facilities, as well as access to new
technology, which pushes up the cost of healthcare,'' he said.
	   The world had shown that there were ``no easy answers'' to
healthcare financing, he added.
	   ``There is no single `right' formula. We may find that our
system operates best with a mix of different approaches.
	   ``Healthcare is an issue that concerns every member of
society.''

	   A SENIOR police officer on Thursday denied allegations in a
Canadian court that he had tried to extort money from Rakesh
Saxena, wanted for embezzlement charges related to the Bangkok Bank
of Commerce scandal.
	   The denial from Pol Maj Gen Chalermdej Jomunud, deputy
commissioner of the Immigration Bureau, followed allegations by
Vancouver accountant Les Hammond, who said the officer had asked
for Bt60 million, for bribe and bail, from Saxena just before the
Indian-born banker was arrested.
	   However, Chalermdej said it was not possible for him to demand a
bribe because he had coordinated with Canadian police before he met
Saxena in Vancouver.
	   He added that his meeting with Saxena had been monitored by
plain-clothes Canadian policemen who sat next to their table in a
restaurant.
	   Agence France-Presse reported on Thursday that Hammond, Saxena's
former partner, made the allegations while testifying in Saxena's
hearing for extradition in Vancouver on Wednesday.
	   ''Thai police will ask for bribes regularly,'' said Hammond.
	   Hammond told the British Columbia Supreme Court that the
policeman had used the bank scandal to try and extort money from
Saxena and others charged with embezzlement.
	   He said payments were discussed during meetings with Thai police
at a ski resort in Whistler, north of Vancouver.
	   ''You may not get a fair trial in Thailand but you can always
buy your way out of trouble,'' Hammond said.
	   The latest testimony, under questioning from Saxena's lawyer,
helped portray the fugitive banker as a victim. During questioning
by prosecutors last week, the crown witness revealed the inner
workings of Saxena's financial holdings around the world and his
dubious accounting practices.
	   Saxena, 44, apart from being linked to a US$2 billion bank loan
scandal also faces charges of embezzling $60 million from the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC), where he was once the treasury
adviser.
	   Saxena said that the charges had been filed in revenge after he
had successfully prevented a hostile takeover of the BBC four years
ago.
	   Hammond testified that Saxena had arranged for the money to be
paid in bribes so he could secure bail if he returned to Bangkok.
	   He added that a suitcase containing $100,000 worth of currency
was to be given to Chalermdej and another officer who had travelled
to Vancouver in July 1996 to meet Saxena and convince him to return
to Thailand.
	   Saxena was arrested in Whistler while having lunch with two Thai
policemen in July 1996. Canadian police seized the briefcase
containing the cash.
	   Hammond and Saxena had a falling out later and now Saxena is
suing Hammond for the return of corporate documents which Saxena
claims are his. Hammond is suing Saxena for $138,000 in severance
pay.
	   Saxena fled Thailand on May 18, 1996, one day after the
country's finance minister took control of the bank.
	   He had also been linked to the so-called ''Arms to Africa''
scandal that has rocked the British government.
	   Reports from London say Saxena admitted to paying $1.55 million
to a private British military firm which was instrumental in
staging a military counter-coup in the African nation of Sierra
Leone.

	   Q: I AM 29 years old and a mother of two. In 1995, I was
diagnosed as having an ovarian cyst which measures 2.5cm and
endometriosis. For the past six months, I have been suffering from
abdominal pain and backache.
	   I have blood stains in my discharge. I also have constipation.
Is surgery necessary to remove my endometriosis? Please advise.
	   A: SIMPLE ovarian cysts develop as a result of hormonal
imbalance and are often reabsorbed within a couple of periods.
	   The most common herbs used in the treatment of ovarian cysts are
paeonia and false unicorn root as they help to normalise ovarian
function and development of normal follicles (eggs).
	   Chaste tree, taken in the morning, further helps to regulate the
imbalance of the female hormones, oestrogen and progesterone.
	   If herbal treatment fails, ovarian cysts can be removed
surgically.
	   After removal of the cyst, you can use the same herbs to help
regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce the likelihood of cysts
recurring.
	   The Indian herb gotu kola (Centella asiatica), taken a week
before the operation and for several weeks afterwards, will help
the healing process and reduce scarring.
	   It is not easy to remove endometrial tissue which has found its
way into your abdomen but depending on how advanced your condition
is, surgery may be necessary.
	   It is better to regulate your menstrual cycle with the above
mentioned herbs and thereby reduce the symptoms.
	   However, you should also improve the function of your digestive
system, particularly your bowels. Your diet should be high in fresh
fruits and vegetables and fibre.
	   You should drink plenty of fresh water and you will benefit from
a daily exercise programme.
	   Slippery elm mixed in water or mashed into food (e.g. a banana)
followed by a glass of water helps against constipation and will
also help to restore a proper bowel flora.
	   Then you need to treat your liver. Avoid foods containing
chemicals (food colours, preservatives, pesticides, etc) and use
herbs such as schisandra and St Mary's thistle which support the
liver's ability to break down excess hormones.
	   Other herbs which may be beneficial include evening primrose oil
and ginger extract for the inflammation, cramp bark for the
cramping, pulsatilla for the pain in the ovaries, immune-enhancing
herbs to help prevent and resolve endometriose (such as echinacea
and andrographis) and herbs such as thuja to control benign
growths.

	   TO HELP corporates enhance their liquidity position and manage
their cashflow, Standard Chartered Bank has recently launched a
cheque collection programme, called National Collection Service
(NCS), which will provide funds faster than through the normal
procedures.
	   A corporation, from now on, could receive outstanding monies
within three days of the date indicated on the cheque depending on
the agreement with the bank. Cheques from the provinces may
currently take some seven to 15 days to process. However, NCS will
charge customers 0.2 per cent of the amount due, which is the
regular fee local banks charge their customers.
	   After receiving cheques from customers, NCS will be responsible
for the cheque clearing process with its corresponding banks, Siam
Commercial Bank and Bank of Ayudhya, until the money has been
collected from the cheque issuers.However, in the case of bounced
cheques, NCS would go through the clearing process again. Should
the cheque bounce again, NCS would reject the cheque and debit the
cash it advanced to its customers.
	   ''With increasing competition, most businesses are focusing on
streamlining their operations and on increasing efficiency and
productivity. Standard Chartered Bank understands this need and the
new service will enable companies in Thailand to maximise available
cash resources in order to increase their competitiveness,'' said
Dru Narwani, Standard Chartered Bank's chief executive officer.
	   Meanwhile, Anthony Solimini, the bank's senior product manager
under Corporate and Institutional Banking, said that due to the
sluggish regional economies, it is the perfect time to launch such
a product. The service would help client's manage liquidity and the
use of funds, particular in Thailand where there are number of
cheque clearing zones, and there remains a problem of transit and
clearing time. He added that the service would help customers to
predict the inflow of cash.
	   The service was launched in Malaysia and India early last year
and the bank claims that it has been a successful operation.
	   Despite the bank having less exposure in Thailand due to the
economic downturn, Narwani insisted that the bank has retained its
relationship with its customers and is now concentrating its
business on trade financing and retail businesses such as credit
card operations. The bank's local-currency deposit accounts
currently stand at Bt7-8 billion and while Bt5-10 billion is tied
up with retail and corporate customers.
	   At least 60 per cent of the bank's customers are multinational
corporations, the remainder being local corporations. According to
Mike Wood, the bank's head of Corporate and Institutional Banking,
so far, the bank is focusing on small and medium-sized exporters
and importers.
	   As local banks struggle to boost their capital to cover rising
non-performing loans, several foreign banks, particularly those
that are retail and business-oriented, are shopping around for
cheap stakes in Thai bank's. Standard Chartered Bank is no
exception. According to Narwani, the bank has set three key
stipulations which must be met in acquiring stakes in local banks.
The three factors are high quality books, pricing and strategy. At
present, the bank is in negotiations with some of the domestic
banks.
	   ''We've got a lot of work to do since we're talking about a
potentially huge loss in the future. Pricing is also important. And
we want to extend branches, so we're looking for branch network.
	   ''Currently, I would say there is a 50:50 chance of the deal
going through,'' he said.
	   As the industrial sector is suffering from a liquidity crunch,
the bank has urged the government to ease its monetary policy.
Thippaporn Gertphol, the bank's treasurer, said that the central
bank has been attempting to keep the baht stable since the
beginning of 1997. Currently, she said that there should be a
balance between baht stability and boosting liquidity.
	   ''To ease [monetary policy] a little and inject money into the
industrial sector would be the ideal situation. However, the
monetary policy should not be dropped. The baht has become weaker
and inflation has reached a controllable level. This will make more
cash flow into the market,'' she said.

	   Q: I AM 39 years old, married and with no children. Recently, I
went for a hysterectomy and my doctor advised me to go on hormone
replacement therapy (HRT).
	   She said that if I don't go on HRT, my skin will be wrinkled and
I will look like a 60-year-old in five years' time.
	   I am worried about the side-effects as I do not have any
menopause symptoms at the moment.
	   Is there any risk of breast cancer?
	   What medicine or food supplement do we take to slow down ageing
and bone loss?
	   A: REGULAR weight-bearing exercises have been shown to not only
maintain healthy bone but also improve bone density.
	   Nutrients that are involved in bone structure and re-modelling
include magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, silica, zinc, manganese,
boron and copper, the vitamins A, C and D (sunlight) and
mucopolysaccharides.
	   The correct ratio of nutrients is also important. For example,
the correct ratio of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus is generally
deemed to be two parts calcium to one part magnesium to two parts
phosphorus.
	   An excess of phosphorus can increase the urinary loss of
calcium.
	   A combination of lifestyle management and herbal medicine can
help protect against breast cancer and reduce the severity of
menopausal symptoms.
	   While it is true that the risk of both heart disease and
osteoporosis increases after menopause, they will not necessarily
occur if you partake of a healthy high-fibre, low-fat diet and get
sufficient exercise.
	   Your diet should be high in fresh fruits and vegetables, linseed
and soya bean products. Herbs such as black cohosh will further
reduce the risk of menopausal symptoms and cancer. They will also
probably help prevent osteoporosis, as would a combination of
evening primrose oil and fish oil.

	   LIBERAL Party chief Allen Lee Peng-fei was yesterday appointed
to the Commission on Strategic Development in what was seen as a
move by the government to guard against ``grassroots pressures'' in
the new legislature. The commission is a think-tank that advises
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on a wide spectrum of long-term
development issues.
	   ``Mr Lee's wide experience and experience in the business sector
will be most useful to the work of the commission,'' a government
spokesman said.
	   But an academic believes Mr Lee, a veteran politician, was named
to the commission to maintain his high visibility in public and
keep his pro-business party on the side of the government.
	   James Sung Lap-kung, a lecturer in the department of public and
social administration at the City University, said Liberal
lawmakers could ally themselves with the two major blocs, the
Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong, in the new legislature. Both the Democrats and DAB
support grassroot interest, particularly on livelihood issues.
	   Mr Lee lost in his bid for a Legislative Council seat in the
direct election but 10 of his party members made it through the
functional constituencies and Election Committee.
	   Mr Sung said that with a close relationship between Mr Lee and
Mr Tung in the commission it will be easier for Mr Tung to win over
the 10 LP lawmakers. He said Mr Tung could lobby Mr Lee to prevent
the party from allying with the DP and DAB.
	   Mr Sung added: ``While the Liberal Party advocates an
economic-led strategy, which is in line with the government's
policy, it is important for the government to keep Mr Lee within
its political circle.'' He believes Mr Lee was not appointed to the
Executive Council because the government did not want to cause
conflicts among political parties.
	   It would be better for Mr Lee to exert his influence in the
commission, which covers various issues including education, human
resources, housing and relations between the SAR and Beijing, Mr
Sung said.
	   He said the commission was like a ``super-Exco''.
	   He added Mr Lee's stint with the commission would serve as a
transition to the next polls, which will be held in 2000.
	   Coincidentally, Mr Lee's appointment is from 2 June this year to

	   REAL estate markets in Asia are currently facing a severe
downturn with rentals and capital values falling significantly,
according to the Asia-Pacific Property Digest and the European
Office Index, two recently-published research reports prepared by
international property consultants Jones Lang Wootton (JLW).
	   Craig Plumb, director of Research at JLW (Thailand), commented
that a contrast between the Asian and European office markets is a
clear example of the cyclical nature of the property markets.
	   Asian office markets are suffering from higher vacancies, lower
rents and capital values.
	   According to JLW's Asia-Pacific Property Digest, the office
markets in most Asian cities are witnessing increasing vacancy
rates as many companies in these cities implement rationalisation
and downsizing strategies in response to the regional economic
downturn.
	   During the first quarter of 1998, the Bangkok CBD and Jakarta
office markets experienced negative occupancies, leading vacancy
rates to rise to 26.7 per cent and 13.6 per cent, respectively. The
Kuala Lumpur market witnessed the largest jump among all cities
from 3.7 per cent to 10.6 per cent over the same period. Makati in
the Philippines recorded the lowest rate at 3.5 per cent.
	   Rents fell by 14.2 per cent in Kuala Lumpur, 7.6 per cent in
Hong Kong and 6.6 per cent in Shanghai. Bangkok saw a modest fall
in rents (-4 per cent) over the first quarter. Other cities seeing
a slight drop in rents were Singapore (-3.4 per cent), and Makati
(-3.3 per cent). Tenants in most markets are very cautions about
the expansion of space and relocation though landlords are offering
more incentives.
	   Sales activity has slowed down throughout region. Office capital
values fell in all Asian office markets over the first quarter. The
largest decline in capital values among Asian office markets was in
Jakarta (-30.8 per cent).
	   The Bangkok market saw a drop of only 1.1 per cent during the
last quarter due to a lack of open market volume. In other cities,
capital values fell by 14.6 per cent in Hong Kong, 10.2 per cent in
Singapore, 10 per cent in Kuala Lumpur and 5.2 per cent in Makati.
	   The depreciation of most Asian currencies also have a negative
impact on rents and capital values in the Asian markets.
	   Plumb noted that Thailand was the first country in Asia to
experience the economic downturn and the property market was one of
the first to react with rentals and values falling sharply during
the second half of 1997.
	   ''The rapid economic growth in most Asian countries over the
past five to 10 years generated strong demand for office space in
those countries' major cities, resulting in rapid increase in
rentals and capital values,'' said Plumb.
	   High levels of construction activity followed the market boom,
resulting in significant over-building in most markets. The
situation has been exacerbated by reduced demand as most Asian
countries have been negatively affected by the regional economic
crisis.
	   ''On the other hand, the office markets in Europe are now
emerging from their previous downturn following oversupply and
economic recession, most cities are now experiencing an upturn in
their cycle with rents and capital values picking up,'' he said.

	   Q: MY six-year-old son often has wet palms. Please advise.
	   A: THE most likely cause of sweaty palms in a child is a
condition known as hyperydrosis. This is a condition caused by an
over-activity of the sweat glands. Stress and anxiety increase the
activity of the sympathetic nervous system and can therefore
aggravate the sweating.
	   The herbs traditionally used to treat the nervous system
includes the Chinese herbs zizyphus and rehmannia. Other calming,
nervine tonic herbs such as chamomile and withania may also be of
great benefit.

	   THAILAND-BASED Better CNM International Ltd is set to start
trading in Vietnam, supplying raw materials to five industrial
sectors.
	   Chayanon Kitayachaweng, senior general manager, said the company
will replace its representative office in Ho Chi Minh City with a
head office this year, aiming to boost business through direct
marketing.
	   Founded in 1996, Better CNM is a subsidiary of Thailand's
leading agribusiness conglomerate, Betagro Group.
	   The company's targeted customers are the manufacturing sectors
such as footwear, cosmetics and household items, beer and soft
drinks, sugarcane and beverages, and animal feed meals.
	   Vietnam is in the initial stage of industrial development,
requiring huge amounts of raw materials. Most of the big factories
in Vietnam are operated by parent companies from Europe and the
United States as production bases for exports.
	   He said the company has been working with major international
suppliers including Japan, France, and Britain to supply necessary
raw materials.
	   ''We have gained an edge over our competitors due to our
experienced partners. They (international suppliers) can help seek
out high quality sources of raw materials to cope with demand,''
Chayanon said.

Lebanon announces Eurobond issue, financial rating downgraded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has named Merrill Lynch as lead
manager in a dlrs 500 million Eurobond issue to be launched by the
end of September, newspapers said Friday.
	   State Minister for Finance Fuad Saniora said the bond issue is
part of a plan approved by Parliament to borrow dlrs 2 billion
abroad to restructure part of the dlrs 14 billion national debt.
	   He said the bond will have a minimum seven-year maturity.
	   The announcement was made at a joint press conference Thursday
with Winthrop Smith, chairman of Merrill Lynch International, who
is on his first visit to Lebanon.
	   Another dlrs 500 million Eurobond issue will be announced later
this year, Saniora said.
	   So far, the government has issued five bonds with total value of
about dlrs 1 billion to finance the rebuilding of Lebanon's
infrastructure, which was devastated in the 1975-90 civil war.
Merrill Lynch has lead-managed issues by the Lebanese government
and banks since 1994.
	   Meanwhile, Fitch IBCA, one of the top international rating
agencies, said it was downgrading the country's financial outlook,
which is a blow to Lebanon's effort to improve economic
performance.
	   The agency said in London that it was lowering Lebanon's
long-term currency rating from BB to BB-, citing a deterioration in
the country's fiscal position in 1997 and a high deficit.
	   ``Post-war growth remains below initial expectations, reflecting
continued regional instability,'' said the agency's report carried
Friday by the English-language Daily Star.
	   Merrill Lynch Chairman Smith, speaking Friday after a meeting
with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, said he disagreed with Fitch's
decision. A day earlier, Smith said he was impressed with Lebanon's
reconstruction drive.

Mexico predicts further cuts to boost oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Mexico's Energy Minister Luis Tellez on
Friday said he expected at least two OPEC nations to announce
further production cuts next week to help reduce a global oil glut
that has kept prices low.
	   He declined to specify which countries he expected to make the
reductions.
	   Tellez met briefly with Norwegian Oil Minister Marit Arnstad in
Oslo, one day after Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela announced
plans to cut their total oil production by 450,000 barrels a day as
of July 1 to boost prices.
	   OPEC cut its production quotas by 1.5 million barrels per day in
March. Combined with the expected 150,000-barrel cut by the
unspecified countries, ``this is enough to restore the balance in
the market,'' Tellez said at a news conference.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi
Arabia, reduced its roughly 3-million-barrel daily production by
100,000 barrels to help OPEC reduce supplies but said further cuts
were not immediately planned.

	   PHATRA Thanakit Plc will today sign an agreement to welcome
Merrill Lynch International Holding Inc as the main partner in its
securities company, Phatra Securities Ltd.
	   Sources in the securities industry said Phatra Thanakit will
sell 127.5 million shares to the US company -- or 51 per cent of
its total capital of Bt2.5 billion -- at Bt20.80 apiece.
	   Merrill Lynch International Holding will buy the shares directly
from Phatra Thanakit, which will receive Bt2.65 billion from the
sale, or $63 million.
	   Phatra Securities is 100 per cent owned by Phatra Thanakit, and
the parent company is 49 per cent owned by Thai Farmers Bank.
Merrill Lynch conducted the due diligence in May.
	   The sources said although Phatra Securities has a two-year
partnership with Goldman Sachs, it decided to sell the stake to
Merrill Lynch because it offered a better price.
	   ''Phatra is also impressed with Merrill Lynch's active
operations in securities trading,'' a source said.
	   It has been a vision of Phatra Thanakit chairman Viroj Nualkhair
to build a regional securities house, starting with the selection
of a foreign partner with a worldwide network to strengthen its
securities business.
	   In Thailand, Phatra Securities is among the top five brokerage
houses. Last year it ranked second in terms of broking
transactions, valued at Bt130.5 billion, which drove its market
share to 8.99 per cent. It was second only to Securities One Plc,
which recorded a volume of Bt139 billion, or a 9.59 per cent market
share.
	   But for Viroj the local ranking means nothing if the company
cannot find new markets outside the country so that revenue from
overseas operations can substitute for losses at home.
	   He has been proven right as the economy plunges into recession.
From an annual economic growth of 8 per cent in the past 10 years,
Thailand recorded zero growth last year but the worst is expected
to come this year, with predicted negative growth of 5 per cent.
	   The securities industry is being severely battered as foreign
investors, a major driving force in the local market, disappear due
to a lack of confidence.
	   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, last year
the revenue of 22 operating securities companies dropped sharply
from Bt4.8 billion a year earlier to minus Bt6.12 billion last year
due to lower broking fees, fee-based income and net interest and
dividend income as well as investment losses.
	   ''We need a strong global broker to strengthen our regional
perspective,'' Viroj said three years ago.
	   However, sources in the industry said Phatra might not have
embraced a foreign broker this quickly if the local securities
business remained upbeat.

	   MCSB Education and Training Centre (METC), the information
technology (IT) education arm of MCSB Systems (M) Berhad, has
signed an agreement with Sarawak Information Systems Sdn Bhd
(SAINS).
	   Under the pact, SAINS becomes METC's business partner in
Sarawak, providing IT courses in the State.
	   METC's vice president Jude Tan said the partnership was in line
with the Government's push to promote IT throughout the nation.
	   ``A broad base of the latest IT courses are widely available in
Peninsula Malaysia through education centres like METC.
Unfortunately, the situation is not as compelling in East
Malaysia,'' Tan said in a statement.
	   ``We need to ensure that the entire nation is growing and
learning at the same rate. Geography should not be a barrier since
IT is aimed at bridging this gap,'' she added.
	   Tan expressed confidence that the partnership will invoke
favourable response in Sarawak.
	   ``We were amazed to see the overwhelming response received when
we signed our first agent in Sabah two months ago and we know we
will see a similar response in Sarawak.''
	   Tan said SAINS was selected as METC's partner mainly because of
its team of skilled IT engineers and consultants.
	   ``Technical skills and the ability to transfer knowledge
effectively are key factors in our decision. SAINS clearly meets
our expectations. Their classrooms, for example, are equipped with
the latest hardware and software capabilities,'' she said.
	   Through the collaboration, METC will be sending its certified
training consultants to Kuching to deliver a wide range of both
vendor-oriented and vendor-independent IT courses. Among the
courses that will be made available are those on Novell NetWare,
Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft programming and applications, Lotus
Notes, Lotus applications and Learning Tree certified courses.

	   OUTSPOKEN legislator Chim Pui-chung may be ``pig-headed,
reckless or irresponsible'' but he is not dishonest, his lawyer
told a jury yesterday.
	   John Griffiths, SC, said prosecutors had failed to show the
wealthy politician was guilty of any crime over an allegedly
crooked $350 million property deal.
	   Chim, 50, will take the witness stand today, the 90th day of his
trial on six charges relating to bribery, forgery and conspiracies
to defraud.
	   Mr Griffiths said Chim would explain his actions even though the
defence believed prosecutors had failed to prove criminal
wrongdoing on his part.
	   Introducing the defence case to the jury, Mr Griffiths said Chim
was a well-known personality with a reputation.
	   ``If I said he was outspoken with the radio and press it would
be under-exaggerating.'' Chim had a good character, with his only
conviction 18 years ago when he admitted to being drunk and
disorderly during a spat with a taxi driver on his way home from a
night out.
	   Mr Griffiths said a theme of alleged dishonesty ran through all
charges Chim faced.
	   But he added: ``In 89 days we have not heard a single piece of
direct evidence that Chim was dishonest.
	   ``You can do things because you're reckless, because you're
pig-headed, because you're stupid or you misunderstood the
position.
	   ``But none of these states of mind are good enough to constitute
an intention to commit a crime to defraud.'' Jurors may decide Chim
was ``pig-headed, reckless, irresponsible, but not criminal'', Mr
Griffiths said.
	   Chim is standing trial with Nelson Chan Kai-fung, a director of
Chim's Silver Mountain Company, who denies five charges of fraud
and forgery.
	   Prosecutors allege Chim weaved a massive web of lies out of
``personal greed'' to make tens of millions of dollars illegally.
	   It centres around the build-up to the 1993 sale of Fairmount
Terrace in Repulse Bay, a four-tower block of residential flats.
	   Chim is accused of deceiving minority shareholders of two
companies he controlled _ Mandarin Resources and Lucky Man.
	   The businessman allegedly kept secret an increase in the the
size of building allowed _ making it prime for redevelopment _ and
concealed a $350 million offer from a prospective buyer.
	   He is then said to have snapped up most shares in Lucky Man,
which went on to sell Fairmount Terrace for a massive profit.
	   Mr Griffiths urged jurors not to view the facts with hindsight,
but as they appeared to Chim at the time.
	   The legislator was a wealthy man, but ``it is certainly not a
crime in Hong Kong to make money'', he said.
	   The trial, before Justice Pang Kin-kee, continues.

Dutch government intercepts suspect Pakistan-bound shipments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government has blocked
five export shipments bound for Pakistan because they were
suspected of being destined for ``strategic uses,'' a spokeswoman
said Friday.
	   The government released no details of what was in the shipments
or which companies were trying to export them without the necessary
permits.
	   ``We expected that they would be used for strategic uses,'' said
spokeswoman Paula de Jonge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
	   The shipments were intercepted over the past year she said,
refusing to be more specific. They are still being held in the
Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, Dutch media reported Friday.
	   The suspect shipments came to light this week when Dutch
magazine Vrij Nederland reported that they were destined for
Pakistan's weapons programs.
	   Vrij Nederland reported that the shipments were made by a Dutch
company with links to Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the mastermind of
Pakistan's nuclear program.
	   Khan was convicted in absentia and sentenced to four years in
prison by Amsterdam district court in November 1983 for stealing
confidential information from Urenco, a Dutch-British-German
consortium that enriches uranium for the nuclear power industry.
	   Khan's conviction was later overturned on a legal technicality.
He worked at Urenco in the 1970s.

Britain publishes early release bill for sectarian prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As part of the Northern Ireland
peace settlement, Britain published a bill Friday providing for the
release of up to 400 prisoners belonging to the IRA and pro-British
Protestant paramilitary groups by mid-2000.
	   Reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam stressed that the Irish Republican Army and two
pro-British groups will have to maintain cease-fires and cooperate
with a commission charged with supervising weapons handovers in
order for their supporters to qualify.
	   ``There will be no general amnesty. The gates of the Maze Prison
will not suddenly be thrown open,'' said Mowlam, referring to the
jail near Belfast where most paramilitary prisoners are held.
	   Early releases are a key provision of the peace agreement
endorsed in a May 22 referendum. The accord provides for this
British province to have a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing
assembly and formal links with the Irish Republic.
	   The bill stipulated that each prisoner's case will be reviewed
individually, that prisoners deemed still dangerous to the public
would be kept inside, and that those released will be jailed again
if they commit new violence.
	   The IRA and two Protestant-based groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, have maintained cease-fires
and their political allies endorsed the agreement.
	   Members of dissident groups that have not declared cease-fires,
including the Irish National Liberation Army and Loyalist Volunteer
Force, are not eligible for parole.
	   The province's largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
whose support was vital for the agreement, said it accepted the
wording of the bill, but would suggest some amendments in the House
of Commons ``to try to make it watertight.''
	   ``I accept that for many, particularly the victims and their
families, this is a difficult issue,'' Mowlam said.
	   About 3,400 people have died in nearly 30 years of violence in
Northern Ireland.
	   Publishing the bill is the first step toward introduction in
Parliament.

	   A WOMAN was caught red-handed with pirated compact discs when
they spilled out of a box in front of a Customs and Excise officer.
	   The officer arrested Wong Hung-fan and subsequently searched her
home in Tai Kok Tsui where he found 10,173 pirated discs _ 7,817
video CDs and 2,330 musical CDs.
	   Wong, 45, was convicted in the District Court yesterday of four
counts of possession of copied discs for business purposes without
being licensed by the copyright owner.
	   Judge Bernard Whaley said that under the new ordinance, each CD
could carry a fine of $50,000 and Wong would have to pay a
staggering total of $500 million.
	   Wong's lawyer Newman Wong, however, said his client had to raise
money to support her daughter who was studying at Oxford University
in England.
	   Wong had $20,000 to $30,000 in her account, the court heard.
After considering Wong's financial situation, Judge Whaley imposed
a 12-month jail term instead of imposing a fine.
	   The court was told that Customs and Excise officers placed the
Tai Kok Tsui area under surveillance last July.
	   Wong had been pushing a trolley carrying 12 boxes when a box
tipped scattering the CDs in front of an officer involved in the
surveillance operation.

Moya reaches men's final by defeating Mantilla
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Moya defeating Mantilla  
  By ROB GLOSTER  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carlos Moya, overcoming muggy conditions and a
patient Spanish compatriot, defeated Felix Mantilla 5-7, 6-2, 6-4,
6-2 Friday in the men's semifinals at the French Open.
	   Moya will face yet another Spaniard, Alex Corretja, or Cedric
Pioline in Sunday's final. Pioline is trying to become the first
Frenchman to win at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.
	   Moya mixed his powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots
to throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third set. But Moya won the next five games, losing
just four points during that span, to take control of the match.
	   Moya got to match point with a 205-kph (127-mph) serve that
handcuffed Mantilla, then hit a 197-kph (122-mph) service winner to
finish off the 2-hour, 42-minute match.
	   On Thursday, Monica Seles advanced to the French Open final for
the first time since 1992 and won for the first time against
Martina Hingis, yet showed none of the giddy enthusiasm she had as
a teen-ager.
	   Though Seles flashed a big smile after her 6-3, 6-2 victory in
the semifinals of the event she won three straight times in the
early 1990s, her success was tempered by playing in her first
tournament since her father died of cancer on May 14.
	   ``I do feel happy. I mean, it's really great. But I've tried to
keep a sense of balance,'' said Seles, who pumped her fist in
triumph after Thursday's win over the world's top-ranked woman.
``I'm still going to be missing people. Some things in my life are
not going to be better.''
	   She'll face Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Saturday's final. Sanchez
Vicario celebrated her 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport by blowing a kiss to her Yorkshire terrier in the
VIP box.
	   Seles is 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario, a two-time French Open
champion.
	   Seles is wearing her father's ring on a chain around her neck
and has worn black throughout the French Open. Although the outfit
was chosen before her father's death, she said the color is
fitting.
	   ``I'm really glad it's not a bright color, because it just feels
more appropriate,'' Seles said. ``I try to give respect to Dad.''
	   Seles, who slammed two-handed winners within inches of the
lines, lost all five previous matches against Hingis _ including a
loss in the semifinals here last year.
	   Hingis was overpowering in her run to the semifinals, not losing
a set in the tournament and having little trouble with
eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   But the sixth-seeded Seles was in control throughout, moving
Hingis all over the court with shots that skimmed just over the
net.
	   ``She just hits everything very hard and very aggressively from
every place on the court,'' Hingis said. ``Usually she makes more
mistakes or she gets a little bit tired, but today she just
didn't.''
	   Seles was the aggressor from the start, showing her intensity by
walking back on court first after every changeover. Hingis,
normally composed, scolded herself and bounced her racket on the
clay in frustration.
	   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive,'' Seles
said. ``I knew I had that in me. I wasn't sure if I could do that
today, but I really believed I could.''
	   Hingis won every Grand Slam tournament title last year except
the French Open, losing in the final to Iva Majoli. She said Seles,
who at 24 is seven years older than Hingis, ran her to exhaustion.
	   ``I was probably getting a little bit tired. She just made me
run, and she didn't make any mistakes,'' Hingis said. ``I guess she
surprised everybody.
	   ``I mean, she was around for quite a while, then all of a sudden
she was gone for years,'' Hingis added. ``And here she is back, in
better shape and probably better than ever.''
	   Seles was 17 when she won her first Grand Slam tournament title
at the 1990 French Open, the first of three straight championships
at Roland Garros. She ruled women's tennis in those years, her
victories punctuated with high-pitched grunts. Off the court, she
was a teen-ager with an infectious giggle.
	   But all that changed in April 1993, when a spectator came out of
the stands at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, and stabbed her in
the back. Seles didn't return to the tennis tour until August 1995,
and even then she was subdued and emotionally strained.
	   The last two years have been even tougher because of the failing
health of her father, Karolj, who until shortly before his death
was her only coach. She was at his side in Sarasota, Fla., when he
died.
	   ``Obviously, the last five years have been very difficult in
terms of walking on the court, while before I only had to worry
about winning or losing the tennis match,'' she said. ``It's not
the same as it was before the stabbing. It never will be, and I
don't want it to be.''
	   The other women's semifinal included 15 service breaks in 21
games. Davenport held her serve just twice in 10 attempts and also
was inconsistent with her groundstrokes.
	   ``I know she was very tired, and I just had to just hang in
there,'' said Sanchez Vicario, whose dog lapped up a lunch of ham
and bread chunks while sitting with Sanchez Vicario's mother in the
stands.
	   Leading 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario made one of her
trademark remarkable saves and sent back a high defensive lob.
Davenport had an easy putaway, but her overhead slam sailed wide,
ending the match.
	   ``I guess I beat myself,'' Davenport said, ``but she kind of
forced it on me.''

	   SEEMINGLY feeling secure in his new-found role as a reformist,
Indonesian President Bachuraddin Habibie indicated [on Wednesday]
that he plans to remain in office for a long time yet. Elections
are now unlikely to be held before the end of next year and the new
president hinted he may be a candidate.
	   Habibie has even taken to comparing himself with Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an effort to show
that rising to power through an autocratic system is no bar to
being a radical reformer. The rapid release of political prisoners,
coupled with promises to repeal repressive laws have certainly
played their part in consolidating his position far faster than
anyone expected, with even opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
now offering qualified support.
	   The president has also shown himself to have some political
skills, continually using the nation's economic woes as an excuse
to distract attention from the need for political reform, while
apparently forgetting his part in the failed policies that brought
such chaos to Indonesia. But the most crucial factor has been the
continued backing of powerful military chief General Wiranto.
	   If Habibie continues to make concessions at regular intervals,
he may survive in office far longer than anyone initially expected.
Having originally been written off as a stop-gap solution, the new
president seems to have acquired a surprisingly firm grip on the
reins of power.
	   US empty threatsTHE Clinton administration has said time and
again that it won't permit Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic to extend
his brutal ethnic-cleansing tactics to the independence-minded
province of Kosovo. Now Milosevic's troops are conducting precisely
such atrocities in Kosovo, and the administration's response so
far: more talk.
	   US policy on all this has been pretty clear -- at least in
words. The United States doesn't support Kosovo independence, but
it does support legitimate aspirations for more autonomy. It
favours peaceful dialogue and opposes armed conflict. President
Bush warned in 1992 that the US would use force if necessary to
block ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The Clinton administration
embraced that warning in 1993. And as recently as three months ago,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the US would not ''stand
by and watch the Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no
longer get away with doing in Bosnia.'' US policy in the past three
months has been a confusing mixture of sanctions threatened,
imposed and withdrawn. Such sanctions are in any case mostly beside
the point; only the credible threat of force, and the use of force
if necessary, can deter Milosevic. The US can intervene now, as it
has said it would. Or, as in Bosnia, it can be forced to intervene
later, after much damage has been done and any solution is far more
difficult.
	   The Washington Post No more officialese A MODEST revolution is
under way in Washington, aimed at getting the federal government to
stop using needlessly dense language when it talks to ordinary
people. From now on, official statements, rules and directives are
supposed to be written briefly and in plain language.
	   Redundancy and jargon are out. The passive voice must yield to
the active. Thus we might one day see President Clinton step
forward to concede ''I screwed up,'' instead of reporting obliquely
in the classically Reaganesque phrase that ''mistakes were made.''
Using plain English is an effort not to dumb down government but
rather to make it more accessible, comprehensible and efficient --
in short, to have it serve the citizenry better. Constant vigilance
will be needed to prevent backsliding, for there is something in
the bureaucratic soul that apparently cannot abide directness and
clarity in language, that shies from using a single simple word
when three or four polysyllabic ones come to mind.

	   Last week's decision by the Sangha Supreme Council to curb
Buddhist temples profiteering from funeral rites is not enough. The
Buddhist monastic hierarchy desperately needs drastic reform, Thana
Poopat writes.
	   THE proposal that the Religious Affairs Department submitted
last Friday to the Sangha Supreme Council was unusually audacious;
the Sangha's reaction was predictably defensive.
	   The Religious Affairs Department, prodded by Deputy Education
Minister Arkhom Engchuan, proposed a curb on profiteering and
commercialisation of Buddhism by monks and lay management
committees of temples. The council meeting, chaired by the Supreme
Patriarch, resolved to make it compulsory for all Buddhist temples
to provide funeral rites free of charge to the destitute and to
refrain from profiteering from funerals.
	   But the council, the governing body of Buddhist monks, baulked
at Arkhom's aim to have assets of all Buddhist temples audited as
part of efforts to suppress corruption and ensure transparency in
the management of monasteries.
	   The council said it wants a public hearing on the proposal first
so that it can gauge public opinion before it considers the
proposal.
	   What do ordinary Buddhists have to say about the proposal to
promote good governance in Buddhist temples? Probably, not much --
judging from the prevailing apathy towards religious affairs.
	   Most Buddhists have an extraordinary amount of tolerance for
monastic authorities, who are allowed to run their own affairs as
they see fit.
	   Profiteering, commercialisation, misuse of funds, cheating by
monks and lay management committees are widespread. The public
continues to give the Buddhist monastic order the benefit of the
doubt and to hope that things will get better.
	   But things won't get better unless the Sangha, which has been
criticised for inaction and moral vacillation, changes its ways.
	   There are compelling reasons why the public should care more
about how temples are run.
	   It is true that few people making donations to temples consider
it an investment in the business sense. That's why they feel they
don't need to know what the temples are doing with their money. Not
even the Buddhists who consider their donations an investment for
their next incarnation care where their money goes.
	   In good times, people made merit by giving a lot of money to
temples because it made them feel good contributing to Buddhism.
	   Until recently, people have not felt that temples had any role
except to propagate and teach Buddhism. Only a handful of
idealistic monks, concerned for people and the world around them,
have been doing what they could to improve people's lives.
	   As Thailand slides deeper into the worst economic crisis in
modern history, more and more Buddhists are looking to temples for
solace.
	   It is common knowledge that much of the money donated by
Buddhists has been squandered on building bigger and more
elaborately-designed chanting halls and other buildings. Many
Buddhist temples compete among themselves in their outward,
material pursuits.
	   In these difficult times, should temples that have accumulated
great wealth during the economic boom do nothing to relieve the
suffering of the people?
	   People no longer have as much money as they used to for
donations to temples. And even those who still have some money to
spare expect temples to make better and more efficient use of
donations, such as helping the poor.
	   The Sangha has no justification for blocking or delaying the
reform proposal.
	   At present, the law requires Buddhist temples to keep account
books and report their balances to higher authorities. But few
temples observe it, and monastic authorities do not enforce it.
	   Apart from the corrupt activities of some monks and temple lay
management committees, the generally low education of monks is
cited as a reason for the mismanagement and financial fraud at many
monasteries.
	   According a 1996 Religious Affairs Department survey, almost 80
per cent of abbots as well as tambon, district, provincial and
regional Buddhist monastic chiefs have had only four years of
formal schooling, or up to Prathom 4 level.
	   For ordinary monks, a low education may be made up for with
Buddhist scholastic attainment. But four years of formal schooling
is grossly inadequate for abbots and monastic chiefs who are
supposed to manage their temples and supervise people in their
charge.
	   The Religious Affairs Department is implementing a programme to
train abbots and other monastic chiefs in modern management to help
improve the way temples are run.
	   Arkhom forwarded his proposal following an outcry after a temple
in Bangkok last month refused to provide funeral rites for a man
whose relatives could not afford the price demanded by the temple.
	   The deputy education minister has proposed that the 30,377
temples throughout the country adopt a more transparent management
to prevent ''exploitation'' of Buddhism and to promote financial
prudence of temples in handling donations.
	   A lack of compassion on the part of many Buddhist temples seems
to have come into sharper focus in the economic crisis.
	   The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has complained of the
lack of cooperation of Bangkok temples in its campaign to persuade
them to provide funeral services free of charge for the destitute.
Only 21 out of 426 temples in the capital city participated in the
programme over the past year.
	   Buddhism has always been regarded as the main pillar of society,
the guarantor of public morality.
	   The question that needs answering by the Sangha and the public
is: Why should the public be content with anything less than moral
uprightness, compassion and transparency from the Buddhist monastic
authorities?

	   Q: I AM 57 years old. Lately I have been having difficulty
achieving an erection. Is it because of low testosterone due to
age? Kindly advise on some herbs I could take.
	   A: WHILE it may be due to low levels of testosterone, it could
also be due to a disturbance in circulation.
	   Some men find that the circulation can be improved with
concentrated extracts of ginkgo biloba and ginger.
	   Traditional herbs for impotence include sarsaparilla, damiana
and ginseng. Clinical trials have shown that ginseng in high doses
certainly increases low levels of testosterone.

Volkswagen wins control of Rolls-Royce

  Eds: LEADS with BMW canceling engine deal; background on
Volkswagen's history in Nazi Germany, quotes from Vickers chairman,
EDITS to tighten; no pickup  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG won shareholder approval Friday to
buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. for 430 million pounds (dlrs 700
million), despite angry bursts of nationalism from small investors
who fought to keep the luxury carmaker British.
	   Vickers PLC, the engineering group that owns Rolls-Royce,
announced at the end of a stormy meeting that investors had agreed
to sell Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen, the German company that is
Europe's biggest automaker.
	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' shareholder Rodney Crowe
asked during the special meeting.
	   ``What are we going to have? A flying lady on the front of the
Beetle?'' Crowe said later, conjuring up an image of the
distinctive Rolls-Royce hood ornament placed on a Volkswagen Bug.
	   Some investors sounded like they were ready to refight World War
II in a session where they first rejected a bid of 340 million
pounds (dlrs 554 million) from rival German automaker BMW.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers in the packed auditorium when he
referred to Volkswagen's origins in Nazi Germany. Volkswagen was
founded under Adolf Hitler's guidance in the late 1930s and
manufactured weapons during the war.
	   Volkswagen faced not just vocal objections but some real
potential hurdles at it moves to take over production of luxury
Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, which cost at minimum around dlrs
250,000 each.
	   The jilted suitor, BMW, supplies some engines to Rolls-Royce but
said Friday it was terminating the contract as it had previously
threatened. BMW spokesman Jurg Dinner would not disclose how long
it will still have to deliver the engines.
	   Volkswagen sought to remedy the problem at least in part by
agreeing to also purchase the auto engine maker Cosworth, also from
Vickers, for 120 million pounds (dlrs 196 million).
	   Rolls-Royce PLC, a separate company that makes jet engines,
controls the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo and has made it clear
it would rather see the deal go to BMW, which happens to be its
partner in a jet engine venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC has not said whether it will negotiate with
Volkswagen or try to block its use of the brand name.
	   Asked about that, the Vickers chairman, Sir Colin Chandler,
insisted that a 25-year-old contract that would let Rolls-Roye PLC
veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Ltd. by a foreign
buyer is legally unenforceable.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the flying lady and Bentley.''
	   But some shareholders expressed worries that the Rolls
production line could be halted by the dispute. Vickers hopes to
close the deal by July 3.
	   One investor expressed disgust at the fight over a name that
epitomizes handmade British luxury.
	   ``It's harmful for Rolls-Royce PLC and it's harmful for Vickers
and they don't seem to care,'' Carol Day said. ``They're behaving
like 6-year-old children.''
	   The takeover announcement also was delayed by a Rolls-Royce
enthusiasts group, Crewe Motors, that wanted to keep Rolls-Royce
British. The group claimed it was on the verge of putting together
a 500 million pound (dlrs 815 million) offer from private backers.
	   Its chairman, lawyer Michael Shrimpton, who has failed in
previous attempts to put together a bid, forced Vickers to adjourn
the meeting for nearly one hour, but the Vickers chairman was
unconvinced and refused any further delays.
	   Chandler said he understood the small shareholders' emotional
reaction to the sale, but stressed it was in their best interests
as well as in the interest of Rolls-Royce, which he said needs a
strong automotive owner to compete in the increasingly global
industry.
	   After it was all over, Chandler said: ``For Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars, Volkswagen provides a parent with engineering capability,
resources, expertise in brand management, and a global reach that
matches BMW.''

World Cup: French resort welcomes Japanese team _ and tourists

	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The road signs are in Japanese.
Flags of red and white are on every other street corner. Shop
windows have suddenly taken on an Oriental motif with decorative
fans and folding screens.
	   The southeastern town of Aix-les-Bains was prepared when Japan's
World Cup squad arrived Friday.
	   The picturesque lakeside resort, which will serve as the team's
base training camp during the tournament, also has its eyes on the
thousands of Japanese travelers who are expected to follow.
	   About 45 students from Lamartine elementary school were waiting
at the four-star Park Hotel for the team's bus from Switzerland and
broke into a Japanese song about cherry blossoms called ``Sakura.''
	   The players looked on, some with smiles on their faces. Coach
Takeshi Okada received an honorary medal from the region's leaders.
	   Nine-year-old Cyril Medard was excited to see the Japanese
stars.
	   ``I like Ihara because he is the captain,'' he said, referring
to defender Masami Ihara, 30.
	   He shouted a cheer in Japanese with his classmates, ``Ganbare
Nippon!'' meaning ``Go Japan!''
	   Aix-les-Bains, with a population of 25,000, has spent 800,000
francs (dlrs 136,000) to prepare for the anticipated onslaught of
Japanese soccer fans, estimated to run as high as 10,000 this
month.
	   Besides a telephone information service in Japanese and crash
courses for restaurant owners and shopkeepers on how to serve them,
the city has printed brochures in Japanese about the region and
hired interpreters.
	   An additional 1.5 million francs (dlrs 254,000) went into
renovating the J. Forestier municipal stadium, where the Japanese
team will practice.
	   Michel Albert, director of the Aix-les-Bains tourism office,
believes the publicity the town will get is worth every franc.
	   ``Word of mouth is the best promotion,'' he said. ``It's very
important everything will be good, the best, for the Japanese
team.''
	   To make sure the players get some peace, other Japanese guests
will not be staying at the Park Hotel, said hotel spokeswoman
Nathalie Gagnier.
	   The players will have the indoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi to
themselves during part of the day. The city has even built a
Japanese garden in front of the hotel.
	   ``It's quiet here,'' said Japan Football Association spokesman
Hiroshi Onozawa. ``It's a place where they can focus on their
training.''
	   Marianne Daune, 53, who owns a clothing store near the Park
Hotel, doesn't care much for soccer but was nevertheless glad the
team had chosen her town.
	   ``But I hope it'll be a plus for business,'' she said.

	   SINCE India and Pakistan began their nuclear testing, there have
been a number of serious earthquakes. One of the largest,
registering a massive 7.0 on the Richter scale, took place in
Afghanistan on the same day Pakistan conducted its last nuclear
test, and aid officials put the ''total death toll at more than
4,000''.
	   The site of the earthquake is a few hundred kilometres from the
nuclear testing ground close to Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.
On May 28 when Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests, a series of
eight tremors hit the Russian Kamchatka Peninsular on the north
Pacific coast, registering up to magnitude seven. Minor quakes
registering 3.1 were also felt in Beijing.
	   There is, I am sure, considerable undisclosed evidence that
nuclear weapons do cause earthquakes. One example that they do,
though doubtless not the best, is given in ''Natural Disasters --
Acts of God or Acts of Man?'', a report prepared by the Swedish Red
Cross and the International Institute for Environment and
Development. It says that following ''an underground nuclear test
in Nevada in 1968, which registered 6.3 on the Richter scale, was
followed by a series of tremors of up to 5.0.
	   Another seismic event linked to nuclear testing was the eruption
of a large volcano in New Zealand shortly after the French nuclear
tests in the Pacific a few years ago.
	   If the nuclear weapon tests by India and Pakistan did
precipitate the earthquake in neighbouring Afghanistan, or trigger
a far greater earthquake than would otherwise have happened -- with
the resultant deaths of thousands of innocent people, who is to be
held responsible?
	   If another war -- God forbid a nuclear one -- were to break out
as a result of the resumption of the arms race in South Asia,
itself sparked by right-wing nationalist chest beating, who could
we hold responsible?
	   Will there ever be an end to this kind of militant insanity, and
what further extremes will it lead to?
	   Could it lead to China deciding that the Indian finger-pointing
is justified enough to resume an overt nuclear weapon testing
programme, which in turn could result in Japan's right wing gaining
political power to initiate the construction of a Japanese nuclear
arsenal?
	   I can imagine a scene not too far in the future where a group of
scientists are being showered with rose petals and accorded
national hero status for developing miniature nuclear bombs that
can easily be smuggled into the capitals of other countries, thus
making billion-dollar nuclear submarines, supersonic jet bombers
and ballistic missiles and other weapons delivery systems
redundant. Nuclear weapons at a fraction of the price! Who would
need an army? You too could be sleeping with a nuclear bomb in your
backyard! Anyway, don't worry, our wise leaders will sort things
out. After all, isn't it a sign of enlightenment that we haven't
been subjected to a ''major'' war in 50 years now?
	   Sorry if that disturbs anyone's sleep, but maybe a little
prodding will help us all to act when needed.

	   UNDETERRED by Malaysia's credit crunch, Deraya Corp Sdn Bhd
chief executive Abdul Baith Azman has pressed ahead with plans to
launch a four- star beach resort in Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan.
	   ``We are very confident that we will be able to attract buyers
to take up ownership of the Mayang Sari Beach Resort even during
the economic slowdown. Research showed that the timeshare industry
is still doing well in the country,'' he told reporters at a
preview of the beach resort in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   Abdul Baith is selling the units of the Mayang Sari Beach Resort
based on a concept similar to that of the timeshare industry.
	   ``Unlike the timeshare programme which entitles buyers to the
right of use, however, our joint ownership programme entitles them
to actually own the unit.
	   ``In addition, buyers will enjoy two weeks stay in the unit as
opposed to timeshare's one week stay,'' he said, adding that the
special features give it a competitive advantage over the timeshare
programme.
	   ``For this reason, we believe the response will be good,'' he
said.
	   On top of that, buyers will be entitled to a free membership to
its seasports club known as the Straits Flippers Club, which is
being offered to outsiders for RM2,500.
	   Mayang Sari Beach Resort is located 3.2km away from Port Dickson
town, and requires an hour drive from Kuala Lumpur and 20 minutes
from Seremban.
	   Deraya Corp, which is 100 per cent owned by Abdul Baith, is
currently managing the beach resort through its subsidiary Deraya
Resort Sdn Bhd.
	   Construction of the RM135 million beach resort is divided into
two phases.
	   ``We have begun construction on one of the three apartment
blocks for phase one a year ago. It is expected to be completed by
the end of the year.
	   ``Construction work on the remaining two apartment blocks will
start in three months and is expected to be operational by the end
of next year,''
	   he said. In phase one, there will be a total of 480 one-, two-
and three- bedroom units.
	   But the fate of the second phase, which will comprise 300
corporate units, will depend on the condition of the economy, Abdul
Baith said.
	   ``With the corporate market still weak, we expect to start work
on phase two only next year,'' he said.
	   On the price of the one-, two- and three-bedroom units of the
Mayang Sari Beach Resort, he said, it is being offered at RM9,500,
RM11,500 and RM13,800 respectively.
	   On top of that, buyers are also expected to pay an additional
RM500 management fees per year.
	   ``To date, we have already sold 50 per cent of the total units
for phase one to personal users,'' he said, adding that he is
eyeing families, local holiday-goers and middle income people.

	   Hanson fans racism, Howard adds fuelAustralian Prime Minister
John Howard may moan and whine about how he personally abhors
racism, as he did this week, but few people will believe him. For
when Pauline Hanson warned that Australia risked being swamped by
Asians in her maiden parliamentary speech two years ago, Howard
could have easily knocked the wheels off her racist bandwagon.
	   He didn't. Instead he chose to remain silent, claiming that
Hanson was exercising her freedom of speech. But surely if he was
truly opposed to racism, he should have exercised his own freedom
of speech to condemn her. It was this abrogation of political
leadership that led to the call for Howard's resignation by senator
Mechai Viravaidya in a speech he made at Melbourne University soon
after Hanson unleashed her racist diatribe.
	   Clearly Howard's silence speaks volumes for his unwillingness to
alienate the support of those within his own Liberal Party, many of
whom share Hanson's views. After all, Hanson was a member of the
party before she became a political liability and was
unceremoniously expelled.Howard's folly has now boomeranged into
his face. Since her election as an MP in 1996, Hanson has become a
household name, not only in Australia but in Asia. She has built
her One Nation party with the support of disgruntled conservatives
who would normally back Howard. Which is why Howard is actively
wooing One Nation's supporters, especially in keenly-contested
elections such as next Saturday's polls in the northern Australian
state of Queensland.
	   Last week Howard's Liberals resolved to ask voters to direct
their preferences to Hanson before arch-rival Labor in the
election. And if there is any doubt about this decision, there can
be none after Queensland Tourism Minister Bruce Davidson
uncategorically said he would give his vote to a Nazi candidate
before Labor.
	   Every few years or so, Australia embroils itself in a ritual of
self-flagellation -- one involving a bitter debate on race, and in
particular, Asian immigration. In 1984, Prof Geoffrey Blainey, the
dean of arts at Melbourne University, sparked an uproar when he
cast aspersions on Asians in a speech made in a small country town.
Five years later, John Howard, lobbed another racist bomb when he
called for a curb in Asian immigration.
	   And now there is Hanson. But the Hanson phenomenon, unlike past
racist hyper-ventilation, will not go away. Indeed, Hansonmania has
now become a permanent feature in the political landscape of
Australia. And that spells trouble for a country which prides
itself on its multiculturalism.
	   Like her racist predecessors, Hanson has given a certain sheen
and respectability to racism. After all, if an MP can openly
maligned Asians and Aborigines, there can't be anything wrong for
middle Australia to do likewise. Hanson has no doubt successfully
tapped into the hidden fears of white Australia and become a
lightning rod for the serious concerns about the country's social
and economic problems. According to her homespun philosophy, these
complex problems stem from Asians inundating Australia and from
Aborigines sponging off welfare.
	   Apparently, a sizable proportion of Australians have bought such
Hansonisms. This week, a poll found One Nation commanding the
support of 15 per cent of voters in redneck Queensland -- enough to
give it several seats and the momentum for the upcoming federal
election which Howard must call by mid-next year. This will make
One Nation the third force in Australian politics behind the
conservatives and Labor.
	   On Tuesday, Howard said One Nation was a party which seeks to
attract racists. He is right. And apparently he is one of them. How
else then to explain why he attacks Hanson and yet crawls into bed
with One Nation when it comes to directing preferences? There is
little difference separating Howard from Hanson. Both want cuts in
Asian immigration, to roll back Aboriginal native titles and to
slash social welfare.
	   But while many have no qualms in calling Hanson a bigot, few
dare call Howard a racist. Deputy Labor leader Gareth Evans himself
doesn't believe that Howard is a racist. Howard, he said, was just
being ''insensitive'' to racial issues. But his colleague, John
Della Bosca, is not so magnanimous. At a party conference this
week, the influential secretary of Labor's New South Wales branch
inferred that Howard was a racist pandering to Hanson.
	   We couldn't agree more.

	   SPORTS Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the problem of
unsatisfactory ticket sales by agents appointed by the Commonwealth
Games Federation (CGF) outside Malaysia will be overcome fast.
	   ``I have informed CGF chairman Michael Fennel and he appreciated
our wish to sell the tickets more aggressively,'' he said after
launching `The Big Ticket Show' television programme in Kuala
Lumpur The problem of poor ticket sales overseas arose because some
agents were selling the tickets in packages which includes
transportation and accommodation.
	   This has deterred people who wish to make their own choices of
accommodation to watch the Games on Sept 11-21.
	   Muhyiddin said CGF rules prohibited agents appointed by Games
organisers Sukom Ninety Eight from selling tickets directly in
other Commonwealth countries without CGF consent.
	   ``Fennel is giving it until the end of this month to monitor
ticket sales. If it is still at the old level, he may allow us to
sell directly through our ticketing agent, Ticket Express.''
	   He ruled out the possibility of using Malaysian High Commissions
as overseas ticketing agents.

	   I WAS surprised and perplexed to learn that the Thai foreign
minister would meet the ambassadors of India and Pakistan over the
nuclear issue, although I applaud the efforts. Isn't this unusual
for the Asean's normal practice of non-interference with other
countries, for example, Burma and Cambodia? What is this new spin?
Is Thailand planning to enter the big league? If so, then push
human rights with your neighbours first. Don't use the Asean mantra
one day and do something opposite the next day, or you may wind up
smelling like the US two-faced policy.

	   MALAYSIAN Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) has affirmed the short-term
rating of MARC-3 for HVD Holdings Sdn Bhd's RM70 million revolving
underwritten facility. In a statement, MARC said the rating
reflects the increasing collection delays from a major broadcaster,
the high leverage, and the risk associated with the entertainment
industry. It said support for the facility is provided by the
dominance of HVD's soap operas and television movies in local
programming, the Ministry of Finance's 30 per cent stake and trust
account capturing a two-month interest buffer for the notes.
	   Although HVD remains profitable, MARC is of the opinion that
downward pressure on programme price is imminent as broadcasters
rationalise their operations. However, the agency said the
resultant industry consolidation from this adjustment may improve
HVD's competitive position but margins will moderate. MARC also
said HVD remains reliant on its two major customers, RTM and
Measat, for its viability. It added that expected increases in the
burn-rate of HVD's programmes at RTM is viewed positively.

	   CONGRATULATIONS to Interior Ministry Deputy Permanent Secretary
Prinya Nakchattri, Forestry Department chief Plodprasop Suraswadi
and the Police Department who are cracking down on corruption
within their respective jurisdictions -- including high-ranking
officials. Investigations must be fair, thorough, transparent, and
go to the highest levels of influence. The masterminds must be
jailed for many years -- not just transferred or fined.
	   But for long-lasting good governance, the government must reform
the entire civil service. Not only are there some rotten
individuals, the entire bureaucracy must be re-engineered. Civil
servants and politicians must be paid what they would earn in the
private sector, and meet the same expectations of accountability,
transparency and honesty. Voters should not accept a colonel or
minister who's crooked any more than shareholders would keep a
crooked executive.

	   IT'S a mammoth task for Sukom Ninety-Eight, the Kuala Lumpur
Commonwealth Games organisers, to raise the final 10 per cent of
the RM310 million budget with less than 100 days to go.
	   To achieve that target, Sukom chief operating officer Datuk Seri
Abdul Manaf Ibrahim has called for the support of all Malaysians in
buying the Games tickets when they go on sale next month.
	   ``It's by no means an easy task to raise about RM11 million a
month. We are still short by about RM33 million with only three
months left,'' said Manaf at Bukit Jalil yesterday.
	   ``Our marketing people have been busy trying to accomplish this
to make sure the Games will be a success.
	   ``Any contributions we receive would be timely, especially when
we are living under a cloud of economic uncertainty.
	   ``But I'm sure the worst is over and that local corporations as
well as individuals would help us make the Games the best ever in
this century.''
	   Manap said of the 1.28 million tickets on offer, only 60,000
have been sold and most of the sales were from abroad.
	   ``We are expecting massive local ticket sales once we open shop
next month. The public should come out in full to support the 245
athletes representing Malaysia.''
	   SPORTS Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is confident of a boom
in ticket sales for the KL Games once sales surpass the 100,000
barrier.
	   At the moment, a total of 61,311 tickets had been purchased
through the internet website, official vendors and 80 ticket
outlets set up throughout the country by Ticket Express, the
official ticketing agents of Sukom Ninety Eight.
	   Of the total, 32,267 tickets were booked locally while the
international bookings came up to 29,044.
	   ``This is the first time local bookings have surpassed the
amount booked by the foreign countries and the number could
increase with the nationwide promotions which are underway now,''
said Muhyiddin after launching a quiz show The Big Ticket in Sungai
Besi.
	   Muhyiddin said the 13-episode quiz which will be aired on TV1
and TV2 from June 7 will offer information on the Games and could
boost ticket sales.

	   JAPANESE trading house Nissho Iwai Corp and its Thai subsidiary
will increase their stake in fertiliser company Thai Central
Chemical Plc (TCCC) to almost 42 per cent from the current 25 per
cent.
	   Subjected to shareholders' approval, Nissho Iwai and Thai
Sunrock Co will raise their combined stake in TCCC to 41.78 per
cent by purchasing capital increase shares issued by TCCC at Bt5
apiece.
	   Thai Sunrock will also provide a US$60 million, five-year loan
to TCCC at an interest rate of one percentage point above the
London Interbank Offered Rate, according to a TCCC report filed on
Thursday with the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Nissho Iwai has a 49
per cent direct and indirect holding in Thai Sunrock.
	   However, a TCCC executive said the Japanese stake increase will
not change management and controlling rights in the company. Nissho
Iwai representatives on the TCCC 20-member board of directors will
remain at five.
	   TCCC has a long-established management agreement with Nissho
Iwai for Japanese involvement in management of the company. TCCC's
current president and director Takashi Hirabayashi is from Nissho
Iwai.
	   After the capital increase, the executive said, the Japanese
firms will have a similar stake as Metro Group companies have in
TCCC.
	   TCCC, a Metro Group company, is a leading manufacturer and
distributor of chemical fertiliser.
	   TCCC will use the long-term loan provided by Thai Sunrock as
working capital to support operations and as a reserve for its
US$60 million Euro Convertible Debentures that some holders might
exercise their options on this October. The loan will come with a
two-and-a-half-year grace period.
	   TCCC is currently 24.99-per cent owned by Nissho Iwai, with
23.13 per cent held by the Metro Group, 13.61 per cent by Bangkok
Steel Industry Plc and Bangkok Steel Marketing Co, and 8.33 per
cent by United Flour Mill Plc. The latter three are under the Metro
Group.Metro Group has 10 per cent in Thai Sunrock, which is a
trading company.
	   The loan agreement will be presented for TCCC shareholders'
approval in a meeting scheduled for June 30. Also to be put forward
for approval will be the allocation of 40 million capital increase
shares to Nissho Iwai, Thai Sunrock, and Central Glass Co, another
Japanese firm, at Bt5 apiece.
	   TCCC shares traded on the local stock market closed at Bt3.50
apiece on Thursday, up Bt0.10 on Tuesday.
	   Central Glass will continue to have three representatives on the
TCCC board of directors.

	   ``But I know I'd have to train very hard to get selected and I
must do well at the Asian FIQ championships in Seoul in August to
prove my worth to the coaches.''
	   However, Poh Lian intends to continue with her education and

	   POLICE are preparing for the onslaught of ``cyber terrorism'' as
crime moves off the streets and onto the world-wide web.
	   And illegal Internet gambling may increase with the advent of
the World Cup, which begins next Wednesday. But the law is still
unclear on bets placed on the network and no prosecutions have yet
been made.
	   Newspapers and magazines carrying advertisements for online
gambling dens could also be breaking the law, but legislation is
undefined on this point. Police chiefs are preparing a research
paper which will be presented to the Legal Department to give
guidance on the issue.
	   Although it is illegal to launch a betting site in Hong Kong
there is no legislation preventing a site being set up abroad to
serve Hong Kong.
	   Police are aware of at least one local man operating a site
registered in the United States.
	   And the World Cup may be a timely excuse for operators to open
shop over the web, say police.
	   New technology in electronic cash transfers may make tracing
gamblers and bookmakers difficult.
	   Also of concern is the threat of loanshark activities.
	   ``Loansharking activity follows gambling _ it is just a matter
of time,'' said Superintendent Jeff Herbert of the criminal
intelligence bureau.
	   He said the police would continue to observe the situation and
collect evidence.
	   ``More and more police officers will be walking the electronic
beat rather than the street beat,'' he said.
	   The law does not specify whether an offence is made when the
computer bet is placed or when it is accepted.
	   No-one has yet been charged with Internet betting offences, and
the police are urging service providers to monitor such sites.
	   Supt Herbert said: ``We are very concerned because the local
population is very pro-gambling by nature and we do not want to see
a proliferation. I can foresee people buying computer equipment
specifically for gambling.'' Off-line electronic cash-cards require
no third party in a transaction.
	   Technology is currently being produced to enable electronic
cash-card users to transfer money via the Internet, and it is
feared this might be used for gambling purposes.
	   This has given rise to fears of an increase in cyber crime as
cash transactions can be carried out with complete anonymity.
	   The Hong Kong Police will join with the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology and computer companies later this month for
a seminar on computer crime.

	   THE Department of Industrial Promotion is preparing a Bt224
million rural industrial development project which it said will
create sustainable jobs for 3,000 people in rural areas over a
three-year period.
	   Funding for the project, which is part of the Bt10 billion
social investment programme, is expected to come from the World
Bank this July, said an Industry Ministry official.
	   The Promotion of Rural Industrial Development project (PRID)
will be implemented jointly by the government, private sector and
rural communities. Corporations will be given incentives to
subcontract production to rural areas. The workers in these areas
will also be trained to carry out the allocated work.
	   ''This project is distinguished in that it will create
sustainable jobs unlike other projects, such as the construction of
roads, reservoirs and pathways. Employment will continue after the
project has been completed,'' said the official.
	   According to the department, the PRID programme will comprise 96
projects to create at least 3,000 jobs that offer Bt3,000 to
Bt10,000 a month. The plan is calculated to be economically viable
since it is estimated that it will put Bt341 million into the
pockets of rural people with an investment cost of Bt224 million.
	   Companies participating in the programme will have the incentive
of a loan at a low interest rate of between six and eight per cent.
Export-oriented manufacturing sectors, such as garments, jewellery,
ornaments, footware, and leatherware are targeted.
	   The Department of Industrial Promotion carried out PRID projects
in 1996 and 1997 but the economic downturn forced their suspension
for 1998 until the government recently initiated the social
investment programme.

	   UNITED Engineers (Malaysia) Bhd (UEM) has confirmed in a
statement yesterday that toll collection on the Manila-Cavite Toll
Expressway started on May 24 this year. However, UEM said its
subsidiary, UEM Mara Philippines Corp, was served with an ex-parte
temporary restraining order by the Regional Trial Court of the City
of Makati, Manila, on May 25 to stop toll collection on the
expressway. The petition for a restraining order was filed by a
local resident, Mr Ernesto B. Francisco Jr, and initially effective
for only 72 hours. The petitioner alleged that ``the toll was
grossly exorbitant and unconscionable for people like him who is a
regular user of the expressway''. On May 27, another Makati judge
ordered the toll collection to be stopped for a further 20 days. A
court hearing was held on June 2, and UEM is still awaiting the
outcome of the hearing, it said.

official visit to Vientiane, during which he met his Laotian
counterpart, Somsavat Lengsavad and Laotian Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphan.
	   Vientiane has not yet allowed vehicles from Thailand to travel
directly to Vientiane through the Thai-Laos Bridge for fear they
would cause traffic congestion.
	   Difficulties in driving to Laos include the fact that in Laos
vehicles use the right-hand side of the road.Thailand and Laos are
in the process of drafting a new transportation agreement that will
facilitate the communication between both countries.

Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and the Harbour
Department on 20 boats carrying commuters in Bangkok's Klong Sam Wa
waterway resulted in three passing and 17 failing, city officials
said on Thursday.
	   Only three passed the 100-decibel loudness limit for passenger
boats, while the rest were found to be louder than 100 db, said Dr
Wanchat Supajaturat, the deputy Bangkok governor.
	   The owners of boats failing the test were given 30 days to set
their engines right. If they fail, they risk being suspended from
operating services, he said.
	   Most boat owners showed a willingness to have their boats
repaired, Wanchat said.

	   TAIWANESE showbiz celebrity Pai Bing-bing, whose daughter was
killed by kidnappers last year, has pledged to fight the decline in
moral standards that led to her daughter's tragic death.
	   Pai, 44, is visiting Hong Kong to promote a TV serialisation of
her autobiography, to be broadcast on Cable TV next week.
	   Her eyes filled with tears as she recalled the tragedy and the
devastating effect it has had on her.
	   ``I don't believe in fate. I have always worked hard for what I
have attained, but if I were not a celebrity, my daughter would be
leading a normal life.
	   ``My success became a curse for her,'' she said.
	   Her daughter, Hsiao-yen, 17, was killed in April last year by
kidnappers who demanded US$5 million ($39 million) in ransom.
	   The murder shocked Taiwan and hundreds of thousands of people
demonstrated in the streets, condemning the government's inability
to put a stop to worsening crime.
	   ``I am sure the criminals had very high IQ and EQ ratings, but
they lacked a basic moral value,'' she said.
	   She is supporting the publication of books that promote
traditional virtues and the need for adults to pay more attention
to their children.
	   The TV series, Grace In My Heart, portrays how she won her fame
and overcame adversity, including the death of her daughter.

	   ONE of the most valuable lessons that we can learn from the
present economic problems is the importance of institutions in both
the private and public sectors adhering strictly to the ethics and
principles governing their work and conduct.
	   If certain commercial banks for instance had stuck to the rules
and regulations governing their lending policies, and were not
overawed by the illustrious connections of some of their big
borrowers, there may not be such a serious financial problem today.
	   Likewise, if some of our politicians had more respect for
professional ethics in the banking sector, they would not have used
their influence, however subtly, to persuade certain banks to set
aside prudence and lend huge amounts to certain individuals.
	   The inability of professionals in the banking sector to resist
pressure and the readiness with which political elites wield
influence is a problem that is linked to not only the nature and
structure of power in our society, but also to a culture and
history that venerate authority.
	   It has created an environment in which the devoted professional
determined to defend the ethical principles fundamental to his job,
in the face of the pulls and pressure of power, is often perceived
as an oddity.
	   This situation is more common in the public sector than in the
private sector. And yet it is institutions associated with the
public sector - the Treasury, the Securities Commission, the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange and Bank Negara - which have been put to the
severest test in the defence of professional ethics as they grapple
with the vicissitudes of the economic problems.
	   These institutions will have to make even tougher decisions in
the coming months as new ethical issues come to the fore.
	   As a case in point, a number of ethical considerations have
already begun to loom large as the Government attempts to save
national and strategic assets buffeted by the financial problem.
	   A strictly professional approach to the problem would be to
articulate the criteria used to determine which assets are of
national and strategic importance and how these assets would be
protected.
	   The mechanism employed for this purpose would be independent of
Executive control and decision-making processes would be as
transparent as possible.
	   If such an approach had been adopted at the very outset, it
would have been more difficult for a segment of the public to
accuse the ruling elites of bias and favouritism in the selection
of companies that deserved financial support.
	   Given its experience with saving national and strategic assets,
it is vital that the Government ensure that the recently announced
Asset Management Company is run in a professional manner.
	   The AMC, established to take over some of the non-performing
loans from financial institutions, should be free of political
influence and should be transparent in its operations if it is to
win the confidence of the local and foreign business communities.
	   In this regard, the firm commitment given by the Governor of
Bank Negara, Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don, that the AMC would uphold
professional ethics, is reassuring.
	   Bank Negara itself - one of the few institutions in the public
realm that cherishes its professional integrity - has, right
through the present situation, shown that it is capable of sound
judgement and competent management of the nation's finances.
	   Its handling of interest rates is an example of this. The bank
realises that the question of whether interest rates should be
raised or reduced is a complex one.
	   While it is cognisant of the danger of a recession setting in if
interest rates remain too high, it is equally aware that any
attempt to reduce them drastically at this point could lead to a
flight of capital.
	   Because it has to weigh the pros and cons in a rational manner
without being influenced by extraneous factors, the bank is in the
best position to make a decision about interest rates.
	   All sectors of society should recognise and respect this as a
fundamental right of a nation's central bank. Recognising the
determination of interest rates as the domain of Bank Negara is
acknowledging the supreme importance of professional ethics in
Malaysia's economic life.
	   It is becoming increasingly obvious that only if ethical
principles are observed and professional standards upheld in public
and private institutions do we stand a chance of getting out of the
current economic quagmire.
	   Chandra Muzaffar President, International Movement for a Just
World

Singaporean says SE Asian leaders' actions escalated crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Missteps by leaders in Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand destroyed market confidence in Southeast Asia and worsened
its economic crisis, Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew was
quoted as saying Friday.
	   ``Really it was a lack of understanding by the leaders that this
was a crisis of confidence,'' Lee was quoted by Kyodo News as
telling an international conference in Tokyo.
	   ``The actions were not confidence-building, they were
confidence-destroying,'' said Lee, a former prime minister. ``That
was the simple reason why it began tumbling down finally.''
	   Lee told a Nihon Keizai newspaper-sponsored conference on the
future of Asia that a different reaction from the governments of
the region could have quelled the crisis and cut the damage in
half.
	   For example, the government of then-Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh failed to heed international bankers' warnings in 1996
that Thailand could not maintain a current account balance that was
8 percent in deficit, Lee said
	   When the financial crisis hit, Thailand unsuccessfully tried to
defend the baht, at a huge loss of 30 billion U.S. dollars.
	   Lee said Chavalit also failed to act on the International
Monetary Fund's recommendation to close down 56 weak banks and
finance houses because the election of his seven-party coalition
government was financed by those same banks and finance houses.
	   ``So they dilly-dallied and as a result the market lost
confidence and the baht sank through the floor,'' he said.
	   Lee also criticized Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir for trying
to blame his country's problems on international currency traders,
and former Indonesian President Suharto for delaying and
half-implementing painful reforms required by the IMF.
	   ``So it was a generation of leaders that did not understand the
world around them had changed and they were not operating in the
1960s but in the 1990s,'' Lee said. ``All this need never have
happened.''

	   PERMODALAN Nasional Bhd (PNB) registered a group pre-tax profit
of RM1.97 billion for the year ended December 31 1997 against
RM2.57 billion achieved in the previous year.
	   Group turnover for last year was slightly higher at RM3.033
billion compared with RM2.98 billion recorded in 1996.
	   Group profit after tax was RM1.96 billion from RM2.57 billion
previously.
	   At the company level, pre-tax profit was RM1.95 billion against
RM2.56 billion in 1996 while turnover was RM2.83 billion from
RM2.78 billion previously.
	   For the whole of last year, PNB had invested some RM6.37 billion
in shares, warrants and transferable subscription rights in 148
companies compared with RM3.61 million in 124 companies in 1996.
	   Among its substantial investments were purchases of shares in
Pos Malaysia Bhd and BIMB Holdings Bhd, says PNB's chairman Tan Sri
Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid in PNB's annual report.
	   Of the total investments, RM483.01 million represented
additional investments from existing portfolios, he noted.
	   Ahmad Sarji added that of the RM483.01 million, RM463.95 million
or 96.06 per cent was attributed to the subscription of rights
issues of shares and warrants, while RM18.52 million or 3.83 per
cent was through offer for sale of shares.
	   The remaining RM0.54 million or 0.11 per cent was additional
investments made through the conversion of loan stocks and
transferable subscription rights into ordinary shares.
	   He also said that as at December 31 1997, PNB had invested
RM13.85 billion in 261 companies of which 221 were public listed
companies as compared with an investment of RM9.38 billion the year
before in 222 companies, of which 184 companies were quoted.
	   Ahmad Sarji noted that until the end of last year, PNB had in
its portfolios, investments in quoted companies and unquoted
companies, various venture capital projects as well as investments
in mutual funds.
	   ``Investments in these companies and funds were made for
long-term strategic purposes to take advantage of superior growth
and long-term profits,'' he said.
	   Touching on its four unit trusts namely, Skim Amanah Saham
Bumiputera (ASB); Skim Amanah Saham Nasional (ASN); Amanah Saham
Wawasan 2020 (ASW 2020); and Amanah Harta Tanah PNB (AHB); Ahmad
Sarji said the unit trusts throughout 1997 had continued to receive
encouraging response from unitholders.
	   For 1997, ASB had registered 216,608 new unitholders and new
investments of RM3.93 billion, comprising RM954.41 million from net
investments and RM2.97 billion from dividends and bonuses
re-invested by unitholders.
	   As at December 31 1997, 4.7 million Bumiputera individuals had
participated in ASB with investments of RM29 billion compared with
4.6 million in 1996 with total investments of RM25 billion.
	   Meanwhile, ASN as at December 31 1997 had 1.3 million
unitholders with investments totalling 1.1 billion units.
	   ASN as at the end of last year had invested RM836.5 million in
51 companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, two unit
trusts and one unquoted company. The balance of RM363.34 million
was invested in money market instruments, said Ahmad Sarji.
	   With regards to its ASW 2020, as at December 31 1997, a total of
827,094 unitholders had subscribed to 1.7 billion units in the unit
trust. ASW 2020 had declared its maiden dividend of 10.1 per cent
in 1997 amounting to RM152 million.
	   AHB meanwhile continued to acquire shop premises to help
diversify its property portfolio, said Ahmad Sarji, adding that
currently AHP has invested in 10 properties throughout the country
at a total acquisition cost of RM81.7 million representing 81.7 per
cent of the fund totalling RM100 million.
	   For AHP, total income received in 1997 was RM20.18 million, a
decrease of 14.04 per cent from RM23.48 million recorded in 1996
while total income before tax was RM10.94 million, a decrease of
35.58 per cent from RM16.98 million earned in 1996.
	   The fall was mainly due to the loss of rental income from its
property in Taman Tun Dr Ismail.

	   WITH his ''main mission'' accomplished, now it's time for Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai to visit the Northeast to stop criticism
that he only intends to help the rich and ignore the plight of the
poor.
	   The prime minister has suspended his planned overseas trips for
three months and during that period he will travel to the
Northeast, the country's poorest region, to meet locals and obtain
first-hand information, Amnuay Patise, the premier's deputy
secretary-general, said on Thursday.
	   ''The prime minister will visit the entire Northeast,'' said
Amnuay, who is drawing up a travel plan for the premier.
	   He will primarily go for one-day visits which are expected to
begin before Parliament reconvenes this month.
	   ''The prime minister wants to monitor the work of provincial
officials and the problems to be solved concretely and more quickly
at the provincial level. He also wants to keep in touch with locals
and listen to their problems,'' Amnuay said.
	   Several groups, including farmers, activists and opposition
politicians, have accused the government of trying to solve
problems only of the wealthy and failing to address the hardships
of the poor.
	   Observers say the prime minister's mission to the Northeast was
not only to hit back at his critics but also to win popularity in
the region which is dominated by the New Aspiration Party, the
major rival of Chuan's Democrat Party.
	   Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said the prime minister
had suspended his overseas visits because Parliament was going to
reconvene and there was work to do in the country.
	   ''The prime minister wants to spend time with Thais as much as
he can,'' said the spokesman.
	   Chuan cancelled a trip to Hong Kong where he was to deliver a
speech at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Hong Kong-based
Far Eastern Economic Review on June 10 and 11.
	   He has also cancelled a trip to Manila to participate in
centenary celebrations marking the independence of the Philippines,
scheduled for June 12-13.
	   His first overseas trip after the three-month suspension will be
to attend a Non-Aligned Movement meeting in August.

	   IT's a pity that there are still a few ``bad apples'' among taxi
drivers who enjoy exploiting the public! It is an even greater pity
that it is so difficult to bring these people to task.
	   In the early hours of last Monday, June 1, I was quoted RM15
flat for taxi fare from ``Carlos'' in Jalan Tun Razak to the
ParkRoyal Hotel in Jalan Sultan Ismail.
	   When I asked that the meter must be used, the driver refused,
turned away and sat down with his colleagues.
	   I then approached two others who were talking and was told to
``go away and stop disturbing them''.
	   About 20 yards away I approached a uniformed policeman at the
premises for assistance but was told that it was up to the taxi
drivers to decide and that he could not interfere.
	   I was most surprised and asked if I could note his number in
order to check on the validity of such a statement (which, I noted,
he was very reluctant to provide)! To the taxi drivers: I think you
are an exploitative bunch of people; to the policeman who showed
little interest: at least you could have given a member of the
public some moral support to chastise such taxi drivers! Finally,
after walking towards Jalan Ampang I found a law abiding taxi
operator who used his meter, and the journey cost RM5.55.
	   It is indeed gratifying to note there are still a number of
decent people out there! Geoffrey Cooper Perak

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The European Union will expand aid to
help Congo rebuild decayed hospitals and roads, the leader of a
visiting EU delegation said.
	   Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Tony Lloyd, Britain's
foreign office minister for Africa, said the EU would increase
earlier grants worth dlrs 100 million earmarked for roads and
health facilities.
	   ``The EU is ready to do more,'' said Lloyd without giving
details of the new contribution.
	   The British official was accompanied on the Congo visit by
representatives of Austria and Luxembourg.
	   Responding to questions of Congo's human rights record, Lloyd
said President Laurent Kabila personally assured him that Congo was
committed to uphold rights and hold democratic elections in future.
	   After ousting the late President Mobutu Sese Seko a year ago,
Kabila pledged to hold elections by 1999.
	   Since then, Congo has outlawed political activities and stepped
up a campaign to jail and beat opponents, human rights activists
and journalists.
	   -----
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ The Ministry of Agriculture has
called on Seychellois to be on the alert for locusts _ insects not
normally found in the vast Indian Ocean archipelago.
	   The advisory came earlier this week when a locust was found
eating banana leaves on the main island, Mahe.
	   The ministry said it knew of two recent cases where locusts were
found on flights arriving from Kenya on the African mainland.
	   Heavy rains throughout northeastern Africa have encouraged the
spread of locusts, which are indigenous to that area.
	   Locusts have only been sighted only a few times in Seychelles
this century and never in sufficient numbers to endanger crops.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ The government has closed the search
for a government hangman or hangwoman after being swamped by
applications from around the world.
	   Swaziland Justice Minister Chief Moweni Simulani on Thursday
said his ministry had received hundreds of applications _ although
the post was never advertised.
	   Letters and phone calls came from men and women in France,
Britain, South Africa, Zambia, Malawi and other countries.
	   ----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A new voting law will limit the number
of ballot papers given voters to a single sheet, to curb abuses
that emerged in 1994's first democratic elections.
	   Under the Presidential and Parliamentary Bill passed by Malawi's
Parliament this week, voters will in future receive a single ballot
paper with all candidates' names listed on it.
	   The next elections are in 1999.
	   In 1994, voters were each given a fistful of ballot slips, one
for each rival candidate. Observers reported that parties were
paying voters to bring them uncompleted slips for the candidates
they did not vote for.
	   President Bakili Muluzi was elected in 1994, ending 30 years of
dictatorship of the late Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
	   ------
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police are investigating a private radio
station that has campaigned against a controversial land reform
bill proposed by President Yoweri Museveni, police sources said
Friday.
	   Press reports said police have questioned a popular broadcaster
on the Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) three times over the past
three weeks.
	   Museveni has publicly accused the broadcaster of inciting the
public against the bill.
	   ``The CBS has engaged in invectives against me trying to use the
lack of information of the population to incite them to rise up
against the constitution,'' Museveni said Monday in Parliament.
	   CBS is owned by the traditional monarchy of the Baganda people,
whose land holdings would be most affected if the bill were passed.
	   The Baganda own land in central and southern Uganda, the richest
and most strategic area of the East African nation. They fear that
outsiders would be able to buy their land, including that seized by
the state from a former Kabaka, as the monarch is called.
	   -----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Malawi's Controller of Customs and
Excise Ernest Mtingwi has warned the nation's government ministers
they are not exempt from paying duty just because they are given
``VIP'' facilities at airports.
	   The Finance Ministry had complained earlier it was falling
behind on customs revenue collection, following political pressure.
Donor agencies funding Malawi's economic reconstruction have urged
President Bakili Muluzi's
	   Government to keep tight reins on state spending and ensure
income collection is both efficient and equitable.
	   Mtingwi said ministers and those accompanying them had been
avoiding filling in required forms while others had undervalued
goods they brought into the country.

	   ECONOMIES in other regions will begin to feel the affects of
Asia's financial crisis within the next three months, economists
warned.
	   Dr Somkiat Osotsapa, an economist at Chulalongkorn University,
predicted countries which will be badly affected by the crisis will
seek about US$300 billion in financial aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
	   He said the global economy is then expected to enter a deep
recession.
	   Somkiat said asset prices across the globe are expected to fall
markedly in the third quarter of 1998. Thailand has already seen
its asset prices decline sharply and value in its equity market
drop by $120 billion.
	   ''There would be no more $150 billion a year pouring into Asian
countries for investment expansion,'' he added.
	   Somkiat said Opec countries are feeling the pain as world oil
prices fall sharply. This will cause a spill-over into Australia,
Europe and the United States.
	   Under the worsening economic situation, Somkiat said the Thai
government is likely to face an uphill task in selling its bonds
internationally. The government plans to issue global bonds in July
in an effort to ease liquidity pressure in the country.
	   PM's Office Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said a global recession
is very likely. Thailand should maintain adequate foreign reserves
to protect it in case an emergency arises.
	   However, Dr Aporn Chewakrengkai, economic adviser to Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, disagreed, saying while some countries face
capital outflows, some countries should benefit from those flows.
	   ''Thus, the economic crisis should not spread into the entire
world,'' she said.
	   For Thailand, Aporn said corporates should maintain monetary
discipline and not borrow heavily from foreign sources.
	   She is worried about export industries, dubbed a major engine to
drive Thailand's economic growth. Exporters are facing fierce
competition.
	   So far, the sharp depreciation of the baht has failed to boost
exports as earlier hoped because of other weak currencies.
	   Kiattisak Meechareon, assistant governor of the Bank of
Thailand, is optimistic Asia's economies will recover if
industrialised countries are willing to provide financial help.
	   ''That will help strengthen the Japanese yen and send other
currencies to stability,'' he said.
	   Economists said the government needs to inject fresh money into
the system in order to boost the stalling economy. Grand
restructuring in every sector should also be taken into account.
	   ''We still have to face a further struggle,'' they said.

Islamic leader calls for release of Yeltsin's envoy in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An Islamic leader in Chechnya demanded Friday that
kidnappers release Russian President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to the
secessionist region, a news agency reported.
	   Valentin Vlasov was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1. No one has
claimed responsibility for holding him or made demands for his
release.
	   Akhmad-Khadzhi Kadyrov, a mufti, or religious leader, urged
Chechens to help police find Vlasov and obtain his release.
	   ``You deserve to be despised and damned by people in this life
and to be punished by God in the other world,'' Kadyrov said to the
kidnappers, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Hundreds of of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
neighboring Russian regions since Chechnya's two-year war for
independence ended in 1996. Most are taken by armed gangs motivated
by ransom.

	   A RECENT news report estimated that there are about 300 Thai
women working as sex slaves in Sydney's brothels alone.
	   And last year, in just a single raid, a joint Malaysian-Thai
police team rescued 39 Thai girls and women from a brothel in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   In a country that has the dubious distinction of having a
flourishing sex industry, Thai women are still being duped into
sexual slavery after being trafficked abroad, believing they will
be given legitimate jobs.
	   ``Migration is normal because of the economic situation in
Thailand. A few years ago when the economy was good, we had women
and children trafficked over from Myanmar.
	   ``To overcome the problem of trafficking in women and children,
governmental and non-governmental organisations have to work
hand-in-hand with grassroots women,'' said Usa Lerdsrisantad,
co-ordinator of the Women's Information Network which is the main
project under the Bangkok- based Foundation for Women (FFW).
	   An NGO, the foundation started in 1984 when its Women's
Information Centre provided advice and information to women seeking
a better life abroad following the collapse of the Thai economy.
Two years later, it opened a women's shelter for victims of
domestic violence.
	   Wanting to stem the flow of women into the sex industry, the
foundation later expanded its activities with the launch of a
village-based education project.
	   ``We inform people about the sex industry in order to give women
an informed choice and counter the activities of recruiters.''
	   The project worked with women and children in the north and
north- eastern parts of the country where recruiters were most
active.
	   Using various forms of media including video tapes about the
lives of Thai women trafficked abroad and forced into the sex
trade, FFW publicises the issue of trafficking right down to the
village level.
	   ``While it is important to respect women's right to
self-determination and their desire to travel abroad, we think that
they should be informed about the risks involved. We produced a
video on Thai women who were trafficked into Germany to let people
know that things overseas are not as rosy as they seem. Many of
these women just wanted to send money home to help their
families,'' said Usa who shared the experiences of her organisation
with participants at a recent four-day workshop on trafficking in
women and children held in Kuala Lumpur.
	   The event was jointly organised by Tenaganita and the Global
Alliance Against Traffic in Women.
	   The Women's Information Network that Usa co-ordinates provides
the community with information to help them make informed decisions
about migrating.
	   ``We closed down our shelter a few years ago to concentrate on
gathering and distributing information and campaign work.''
	   How successful has the foundation's work been?
	   ``We've built up a network of NGOs that works on domestic
violence and encourages more people to campaign against child
prostitution. There's also more awareness on the issue of
trafficking in women and children.
	   ``We're also seeing more children stay in school for up to nine
years whereas previously, they would drop out after only six years
of education,'' added Usa.
	   For social activists like Usa, all the hard work would be worth
it if only one woman or child is saved from the clutches of the
highly-organised traffickers.

	   ENERGY, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie
says the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the independent
power producers (IPPs) will only be reviewed if both parties, the
IPPs and Tenaga Nasional Bhd, reach an agreement.
	   ``However, if both parties feel that the contract need to be
maintained, we will do so,'' he said after opening Malaysian
courier provider City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd's headquarters at
Glenmarie-Hicom Industrial Park in Shah Alam yesterday.
	   Leo Moggie was commenting on the statement by Tenaga Nasional
executive chairman Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali that the present
power purchasing agreement was in the way of lower tariffs.
	   Tajuddin had said on Monday that the implementation of trading
and settlement of electricity in a free market scheme would require
the present PPAs to be undone.
	   In an electricity trading and settlement market, IPPs must
inform the independent Grid System Operator (IGSO) of their plants'
available capacity and their selling price each day.
	   The IGSO, which will manage the systems' operations of the
National Grid by the year 2000, will study the demand and supply
before subscribing it from the IPP offering the cheapest price.
	   Asked if ``Penjanabebas'', the Association of IPPs, agreed to
maintain the contract, Leo Moggie said the Government will honour
any contract.
	   On the courier service industry, he said the Government has no
intention to regulate the structure of courier companies and will
leave them to decide on the path of the industry and its rates.
	   He also said the Government will not issue any new courier
service business licence, as the 115 companies already in operation
are sufficient.
	   The minister added that companies which are not performing will
be given a chance to improve.

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ The National Assembly has taken steps
to facilitate transition to a fully representative government a
week before all-party peace talks on Burundi are to begin in
neighboring Tanzania.
	   It amended the 1992 constitution and a decree passed after
President Pierre Buyoya took power in a July 1996 military coup.
	   The changes cement the legitimacy of the mainly Hutu FRODEBU and
the multi-ethnic Uprona parties to pave the way for their
participation in the peace-process.
	   Fighting between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus has claimed
more than 200,000 lives since 1993.
	   FRODEBU holds a majority of the 81 seats in the largely
non-functional parliament. A number of its members have either been
killed or are in exile following Buyoya's coup.
	   Buyoya is expected to participate for the first time in peace
talks that have been held intermittently since his takeover.
	   -----
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A cholera outbreak has claimed at least
80 lives in Congo's eastern province of North Kivu, state radio
reported Friday.
	   In recent weeks more than 2,200 cholera cases have been
registered by North Kivu health officials and another 700 people
have been infected in other provinces, the radio report said.
	   Cholera is common in parts of West and Central Africa, where
sources of clean drinking water are scarce and people are often
forced to drink and bathe in the same polluted water.
	   ------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The head of the U.N. refugee agency has
asked some 55,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in a northern Liberia
border village to relocate to a more accessible _ and safer _ town
in Liberia's interior.
	   UNHCR director Soren Jessen-Petersen said at the end of a
three-day visit to Liberia on Thursday that the Sierra Leoneans had
fled to the Liberian border town of Vahun early this year to escape
rebel attacks in northwestern Sierra Leone.
	   Roads linking Vahun with Liberia's major centers have been
washed away during the rainy season, forcing aid trucks to
discontinue trips to the town, which is also vulnerable to rebel
attacks, Jessen-Petersen said.
	   UNHCR workers had asked the refugees to trek some 70 kilometers
(45 miles) to Kailahun, a Liberian town accessible by road.
	   Jessen-Petersen visited Sierra Leone earlier this week for talks
aimed at eventually repatriating more than a half-million Sierra
Leonean refugees living mainly in Liberia and Guinea.
	   -------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa may participate
in developing Yemen's port of Aden and the Aden Free Zone, a
government statement said Friday.
	   The port development was among subjects discussed by a South
African technical team that arrived back after a week in Yemen,
where they explored cooperation in agriculture, mining,
construction, electricity supply and commerce.
	   During the first 10 months of 1997, South Africa's total trade
with Yemen increased by 75 percent to 230 million rand (dlrs 44
million) over the previous year.
	   The two governments said in a joint statement that they hoped
discussions with a cross-section of businessmen would lead to a
substantial trade increase.

Filly trying to make English Derby history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ Cape Verdi will make English Derby history
just by racing at Epsom Saturday. But but winning England's most
famous flat race would nudge her into a class of her own.
	   The 1,000 Guineas winner is striving to become the first filly
to win the Derby since 1916. But even if she fails, her place in
history is already secured.
	   For the first time since 1917, the winners of the two Newmarket
classics _ the 1,000 Guineas and the 2,000 Guineas _ will go
head-to-head in the Derby, with Cape Verdi and 2.000 Guineas winner
King of Kings both in the field of 15.
	   Cape Verdi, entered late by the Godolphin syndicate at a cost of
75,000 pounds (dlrs 122,250) last Saturday, will join an elite
group of females in racing if she wins.
	   Only six fillies have won the English Derby in its 218-year
history, the last being Fifinella in 1916.
	   In 1912, Tagalia set a record as the only filly to have won the
1,000 Guineas prior to winning the Derby, a feat Cape Verdi is
trying to match.
	   While Cape Verdi is a sentimental favorite, bookmakers have
listed Greek Dance as the favorite.
	   British bookmakers Coral said a flood of money bet on Greek
Dance Friday saw the odds shorten on Michael Stoute's runner from
7-2 to 3-1.
	   Coral spokesman Simon Clare said betting on early favorite
Second Empire had slowed down and the odds had lengthened from 3-1
to 4-1.
	   This is Greek Dance's first big race, a disadvantage against a
more experienced field. Greek Dance has been brought along slowly
by trainer Michael Stoute and after and the colt remains relatively
unexposed.
	   He ran only once as a juvenile, showing promise finishing a
six-length second to Tamarisk over seven furlongs last September.
	   He did not race again until April when he won a 10-furlong
maiden at Newmarket, starting as 6-4 favorite in a field of 18.
	   He also won his last race, competing in better company in the
Glasgow Stakes over an extended mile and a quarter at York.

	   A PRIVATE meeting between top Democrat Martin Lee Chu-ming and
President Bill Clinton has been confirmed, the Hong Kong Standard
learned yesterday.
	   The two will meet on 3 July, one day after the president's
arrival in Hong Kong, which will also be the last day of his China
trip.
	   The Democratic Party chief will talk about the most favoured
nation trading status when he meets the American leader.
	   But he refused to further disclose his agenda.
	   Mr Lee was invited by Mr Clinton to the White House when the
Hong Kong politician visited the US before the handover.
	   It is believed Mr Clinton will also hold meetings with the
leaders of the other political parties, including those from the
pro-Beijing camp, during his brief visit.
	   Legislator-elect Christine Loh Kung-wai, chairwoman of the
Citizens Party, said she would move for a joint environmental
protection project between the US and China, to be launched in
2000.
	   She stressed Hong Kong's participation in the project was vital.
	   Another legislator-elect, Emily Lau Wai-hing, said her concerns
were always about the rule of law and democratisation of Hong Kong
and the mainland's human rights record.
	   But so far, the two have not received any invitation from the
White House.
	   Pro-Beijing party representatives were not available for
comment.

EU approves joint Alcatel-Thomson control of satellite firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The EU approved Friday plans by the
French engineering company Alcatel-Alsthom and the French defense
electronics firm of Thomson CSF to take joint control of a
satellite firm, Societe Commune de Satellites.
	   The European Commission cleared the takeover of after the two
parties made concessions reducing the risk of Thomson gaining a
dominant position in the satellite components market.
	   ``SCS will operate the business activities of its parent
companies, as well as those of (state-controlled aerospace group)
Aerospatiale in the satellites sector,'' a Commission statement
said.
	   The plan by Alcatel and Thomson CSF to take joint control of SCS
was notified to the Commission in April. At the same time, Alcatel
said it planned to buy a minority stake in Thomson CSF, a unit of
the state-owned Thomson SA.
	   The Commission approved the sale to Alcatel on May 26. Under EU
law it can veto alliances or mergers if it judges these hinder fair
competition in the 15-nation EU.
	   The French government said last year it intended to sell a
minority share of Thomson CSF to Alcatel. The move is part of a
plan to privatize Thomson CSF.

	   FOUR foreign parties are interested in acquiring a stake in
Binariang Bhd, the operator of the Maxis Mobile network said.
	   The four parties are Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT),
Cable  Wireless Plc of UK, British Telecoms and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel).
	   Binariang executive director (sales and marketing), Mr C.Y.
Chin, said the company is still in negotiations and has not arrived
at any decision yet.
	   ``Many foreign companies have expressed their interest to us in
many ways,'' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur yesterday after a
ceremony to celebrate Maxis' 400,000th subscriber.
	   It was earlier reported that Binariang was being courted by many
foreign companies after the Government had further liberalised the
telecommunication industry, allowing foreign equity participation
of up to 61 per cent from an initial 49 per cent.
	   The actual equity to be held by the foreign partner, he said,
will depend on the ``appetite'' of the partner.
	   However, Chin declined to reveal further details on the on-going
discussions.
	   Asked on a recent report that Singtel has offered RM1.4 billion
for a 40 per cent stake in Binariang, Chin said, ``This is merely
speculation. I cannot comment as Binariang has yet to finalise a
deal.''
	   Binariang's current foreign partner, US West - which holds a 19
per cent stake in the company - has no intention of increasing its
stake, Chin added.
	   Binariang's other shareholders are Permodalan Nasional Bhd (with
a 5 per cent stake) and Usha Tegas Sdn Bhd (with a 76 per cent
stake), an investment holding company held by trusts associated
with businessman T.
	   Ananda Krishnan.
	   When asked if Binariang will allow a management change if its
foreign partner holds majority control, Chin said: ``We will make
the necessary adjustments within the Government's framework if the
final offer is attractive enough.''
	   Binariang, he said, will be this year to build telecommunication
towers.
	   Funds for this capital expenditure have been secured but the
company still needs to obtain funding for its future investments.
	   Binariang needs more than RM1 billion in capital expenditure for
the next three years for mobile service, fixed line network,
international gateway and satellite services. The company, however,
will concentrate on being a mobile service operator.
	   The company, Chin said, is expecting a 10 per cent revenue
growth and a RM1.1 billion in turnover this year.
	   Binariang is said to be the second largest telecommunication
service provider, holding 19 per cent of the market share with 77
per cent coverage in populated areas.
	   For the mobile service alone, Maxis commands a 15.4 per cent
share of the 2.6 million subscribers in the mobile phone market.
	   ``The industry is based on a long-term investment and we are
confident that the economic situation will not affect the business
much as we are in a growing market. The penetration rate is still
relatively low,'' Chin said, adding that Maxis is expecting an
additional 100,000 subscribers by the year-end.
	   With a strong subscriber base, Binariang will focus on improving
the quality and broadening its services further.
	   The company has also received a recommendation from Sirim Bhd
for ISO 9002 accreditation for its network management centre
located in Subang Hi- Technology Park in Shah Alam.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Actor and director Rano Karno was declared
Indonesia's first national ambassador for the United Nations
Children's Fund (Unicef) yesterday.
	   Rano, 38, a member of the People's Consultative Assembly,
received the honorary title from Coordinating Minister of People's
Welfare and Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono.
	   Recognized largely by Indonesians for his highly rated TV drama
Si Doel Anak Sekolahan (Doel the College Kid), the actor wept
during his acceptance speech.
	   ``I have officially become a servant of the people,'' the
president director of Karnos Film said.
	   Unicef chief representative for Indonesia Stephen J. Woodhouse
said Rano's task would be to help increase awareness on children's
health. Unicef also focuses on the welfare of pregnant women, both
in remote villages and in urban areas.
	   Indonesia has the highest maternal mortality rate and mortality
rate of children under five in Southeast Asia.
	   Woodhouse said Indonesia's mortality rate of children under five
was 80 per 1,000 live births.
	   He said Rano's selection as national Unicef representative was
mainly because of his role in the national anti-polio drive through
television commercials. Characters of Si Doel were depicted in the
commercials.
	   ``Si Doel has played a critical role in immunizing all children
against polio over the last three years,'' Woodhouse said.
	   Woodhouse said that during his travels across the country,
mothers have told him what ``really encouraged them'' to get their
children immunized was Si Doel and his family.
	   Woodhouse further said that there would also be greater focus on
encouraging husbands to give ``utmost attention to wives during
pregnancy''.
	   ``In villages, I still see pregnant women with huge stomachs
drawing pails of water, carrying them and carrying several heavy
things,'' Woodhouse said.
	   ``Husbands eat good food and wives eat less. No nutrition. They
should be educated on prevention rather than emergency cures which
are rare.''
	   Unicef is the leading development agency working for the
interest of children in over 140 countries worldwide.
	   Advocating the protection of children's rights with governments
and civil societies, its global income in 1996 totaled US$944
million, with 64 percent from government funds and 36 percent from
non-governmental funds. (ylt)

	   AS far as Dr B. Sinniah, head of the National Task Force on
Working Children is concerned, the Malaysian brand of child labour
more often than not constitutes abuse and aggression (intended or
otherwise).
	   ``Children are constantly employed to perform work intended for
adults.
	   Employers prefer them over adults because children are generally
more compliant, and they don't expect much renumeration.
	   ``For example, the employers do not have to contribute towards
the Employees Provident Fund, they do not worry about the medical
and social service coverage of the children, and as child workers
do not have any form of collective representation (a union), they
do not demand higher wages,'' says Sinniah.
	   He argues that child labour is often associated with poor health
as children are a lot more susceptible to occupational hazards.
	   He says that although cases of children maimed or injured at
their workplace receive considerable media attention, they are
quicky forgotten.
	   Take, for example, the 1994 case of 15-year-old Chan Yuen Hin
whose right hand was crushed by a pump machine.
	   Conversely, others argue that the extent of exploitation and the
nature of child labour in Malaysia are blown out of proportion.
	   Says Wahab Saleh, director of labour standards at the Human
Resources Ministry: ``What many these days see as exploitative
child labour must be brought back into the cultural context.
	   ``From time immemorial, children have been working to help their
parents.
	   If they lived on plantations, they would help their parents with
plantation jobs.
	   ``Generally, children do light work and this way, they help
their parents earn. They are not directly employed. In urban or
suburban areas, on the other hand, it is not unusual for a child to
help their parents in the latter's enterprises.
	   ``They learn a trade. Children, after school, would help their
mothers to `jual kuih' (sell home-made cakes), for example.''
	   As far as Wahab is concerned, the stipulations of the Children's
and Young Person's Employment Act (1966) adequately protect our
children.
	   ``If you look at the Act closely, you'd see that the hours a
child is allowed to work in a day are very limited. A child is not
allowed to work for more than six hours a day.
	   ``If the child is attending school, she or he is not to work -
including the time spent at school - for more than seven hours. So,
you see, in essence, if the child attends school, he or she is not
allowed to work for more than an hour a day,'' Wahab explains.
	   Those who disagree with Wahab's view point to the abysmal gap
between the ideals stipulated in the Act and reality.
	   In a 1994 case study of the family circumstances of child
workers in Malaysia, anti-child labour activist Ganesh Rasagam
highlighted the fundamental problems social workers and those
against child labour face in raising awareness.
	   ``Child workers are employed in scattered areas, often hidden
from public view. There's also a lack of awareness on the part of
employers, parents, families, schools, and the authorities.
	   ``Many are unable or unwilling to distinguish between the sort
of light work that is within the child's capacity and which helps
in her personal growth and the high-risk, exploitative work that is
detrimental to the well-being of the child,'' Ganesh elucidates.
	   Just because a child works for her parents, it does not
necessarily mean that she is not exploited or overworked. Take, as
a case in point, the `jual kuih' profile of 10-year-old Ahmad from
Butterworth who is afraid to go home for fear of being beaten on
days when his cakes do not sell. (See Page 1) Aside from parents
and employers who cannot or will not recognise exploitative child
labour, one of the largest obstacles social workers face is the
child workers themselves.
	   ``The child workers do not share the same concerns as we who are
trying to help them. Their primary aim is to earn some money either
for themselves or for their families.
	   ``Very often, they feel grateful towards their employers. School
has no real relevance in their lives; they often view going to
school as a hindrance to their work and are only too willing to
drop out of school at the earliest opportunity,'' says Ganesh.
	   To this, Jalaldin Sahul Hameed, secretary of the National Task
Force on Working Children, who also runs a child welfare centre in
Batang Berjuntai, Selangor, says: ``It is really difficult to reach
out to these children. The general response you get from their
employers is `dia mau cari wang, mengapa kacau sama dia?' (he wants
to earn money, why are you interfering?). Usually, the child
workers express the same sentiment.''
	   So where have our society and policies gone awry if the child
workers are themselves conspirators in their own exploitation?
	   Those against child labour in Malaysia feel the need to
consistently state the obvious: our present welfare and educational
systems are clearly inadequate.
	   ``Schools are generally not concerned with working children or
children who drop out. Readmitting a child who has missed school
for some time is a long and arduous task.
	   ``When they are readmitted, they are placed in the class
according to their age group where they are unable to follow the
lessons and end up being miserable and bored,'' Ganesh explains.
	   And, says Sinniah, school should be mandatory until a certain
age. He also suggests that certain poor families be paid to keep
their children in school.
	   While the government policy of not creating a welfare-dependence
mentality is laudable, Ganesh feels that it is equally important to
have effective support policies and programmes that encourage
independence.
	   Currently, the monthly welfare grant of less than RM100 for a
destitute family with a disabled, alcoholic or drug dependent
parent does not allow this.
	   ``Child labour laws also need to be revamped and enforcement
strengthened. As long as there are employers willing to hire
children.
	   there will be child labour.
	   ``A more practical approach would be to recognise and regulate
the child workers through a registration system that permits them
to work under supervised conditions. It can be made mandatory for
employers of children to ensure that their child workers are
registered and regularly attend an informal education programme
while being guaranteed minimum wages,'' says Ganesh.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie has told university rectors
to facilitate campaigns for reform but to prevent campuses being
turned into political arenas.
	   ``I am calling on the minister of education and culture (Juwono
Sudarsono) and the director of tertiary education not to allow
campuses to be turned into political arenas. Have pity on the
'kids','' Habibie told a gathering of 55 rectors of state and
private universities at his office yesterday.
	   ``The students are the hope of their parents and this nation...
they have done their best. They have successfully rattled their
'parents and grandparents','' Habibie said in an hour-long
off-the-cuff speech.
	   Students in major cities began demonstrating in February against
former president Soeharto and his administration's handling of the
economic crisis. The protests spread to remoter areas and students
became involved in clashes with security personnel.
	   The tension came to a head with the May 12 fatal shooting of
four Trisakti University students and rioting in the three days
thereafter.
	   Soeharto resigned on May 21 and handed the presidency to
Habibie, who found on his first day in the job that some students
disliked him and demonstrated against his accession to power.
	   During those demonstrations, rectors faced a dilemma. Previous
education minister Wiranto Arismunandar wanted them to bar students
from demonstrating, the students wanted to have free rein to hold
rallies both on and outside their campuses, while the military
struggled to keep them within the confines of their university
grounds.
	   Also yesterday, Habibie explained to the rectors about his
consultation last week with leaders of the House of
Representatives, during which they discussed the convening of a
special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) and
holding a general election.
	   He invited the rectors to study the draft laws that the
government is currently preparing on political parties and general
elections -- which are meant to replace the existing laws that
govern Indonesian politics. The drafts will eventually be submitted
for deliberation and approval by the House.
	   ``Once the drafts are finished, I will send them to you. I give
you one month. If I don't hear anything from you by the end of the
month, I'll take it that you agree with the drafts,'' he said.
	   Habibie's call against student politics came as students in a
number of cities -- in Jakarta, Surabaya, Purwokerto in Central
Java, Medan in North Sumatra andYogyakarta -- demonstrated for
various causes. Those in Medan, for instance, demonstrated against
alleged sexual harassment by police officers of female students in
a recent rally.
	   The students in Yogyakarta demonstrated against Regent Bantul
Sri Roso Sudarmo for allegedly being involved in the killing of
local journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin in 1996.
	   Also in Yogyakarta, 100 students from Irian Jaya protested at
the local legislative council over what they alleged was the
government's discrimination against indigenous Irianese people
living in Java.
	   Demonstrations also took place in Palangka Raya, Central
Kalimantan, and Indramayu in West Java. The latter, held by
students demanding the resignation of the regent for alleged
corruption, deteriorated into a rampage which left dozens of shops
and other buildings damaged.
	   In Jakarta, about 50 students and environmental activists
gathered at the United States embassy to convey a statement against
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and condemn the U.S.
government for its inconsistency in implementing its antinuclear
policy.
	   The protesters, representing 28 antinuclear groups, gathered at
midday, yelling and unfurling banners that read ``No Nuke'',
``Don't Destroy Our Earth with Your Nuke'' and ``How About Israel,
Clinton -- You're Not the Law, Stop the Discrimination''.
	   ``The U.S. is very hypocritical and it practices double
standards. It only gives strong criticism against India and
Pakistan, but not of Israel which is obsessed with becoming a
powerful nuclear country,'' said a protester while reading the
statement.
	   In Surabaya, student protesters pulled down and defiled an
American flag at the United States consulate. More than 100 members
of Surabaya Muhammadiyah Students Action Association gathered in
the morning to call for an end to what they said was U.S.
interference in Indonesia's domestic affairs.
	   The students alleged that the United States played a role in the
fall of Soeharto, an accusation immediately rejected by visiting
U.S. Assistant State Secretary for East Asia and the Pacific
Stanley Roth.
	   ``Absolutely, it is not true,'' he told a media briefing in
Jakarta following a meeting with Habibie. ``We have consistently
stated that the political situation in Indonesia is up to the
people of Indonesia to decide.
	   ``It is not for the U.S. to pick the leaders of other countries,
and we took no steps to try... to undermine either president
Soeharto personally or the economy of
Indonesia.''(21/23/44/45/prb/swe)

Mexico predicts further cuts to boost oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Mexico's Energy Minister Luis Tellez on
Friday said he expected at least two OPEC nations to announce
further production cuts next week to help reduce a global oil glut
that has kept prices low.
	   He declined to specify which countries he expected to make the
reductions.
	   Tellez met briefly with Norwegian Oil Minister Marit Arnstad in
Oslo, one day after Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela announced
plans to cut their total oil production by 450,000 barrels a day as
of July 1 to boost prices.
	   OPEC cut its production quotas by 1.5 million barrels per day in
March. Combined with the expected 150,000-barrel cut by the
unspecified countries, ``this is enough to restore the balance in
the market,'' Tellez said at a news conference.
	   Norway, the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi
Arabia, reduced its roughly 3-million-barrel daily production by
100,000 barrels to help OPEC reduce supplies but said further cuts
were not immediately planned.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Leading opposition figure Emil Salim has announced
his withdrawal from a presidential consultative group formed by
President B.J. Habibie, and demanded that a general election be
held by December.
	   In a written statement, Emil expressed ``disappointment'' at
recent developments, including Habibie's recent statement that
polls would be held next year.
	   Though he did not directly attribute his withdrawal to the poll
date issue, Emil emphasized that Habibie during meetings with the
group had said he was merely a transitional president and would
hold elections at the soonest possible date.
	   Emil was one of six key figures invited by Habibie on May 23 to
hold periodic consultations with him.
	   The ``Group of Six'' comprises Amien Rais, Adnan Buyung
Nasution, Sudjana Sapi'ie, Nurcholish Madjid, Rudini and Emil.
	   The group held another meeting on May 26 and, based on the
reported content of the two meetings, had apparently been told by
the President that he would hold polls as soon as possible.
	   After the first meeting, Amien said he would not be involved
further. He said he could work better from outside its parameters
and did not want to give the impression that he was being coopted.
	   Despite the presidential assurances, House of Representatives
Speaker Harmoko, after a meeting with Habibie on May 27, said
elections could only be held after an extraordinary session of the
People's Consultative Assembly. This could only be convened at the
earliest by the end of this year or early next year.
	   In subsequent days, Habibie confirmed that polls would only be
held in 1999.
	   Emil said yesterday he was dismayed at hearing these
developments.
	   ``The agreement (between Habibie and Harmoko) clearly fails to
reflect the awareness (from Habibie) on the urgency of holding an
immediate general election.''
	   Emil denounced Habibie, saying the action ``shows a lack of
political will to shorten the transitional time of the presidency
and the legislative body''.
	   In the written statement distributed by associates in Gema
Madani (Echoes of Civil Society) at a news conference here, Emil
also said polls should precede the convening of an Assembly
session.
	   He urged for elections to be held in December and an Assembly
session in February, saying that Habibie could invoke MPR Decree
No. 5/1998 which gives the president special powers to take such
initiatives.
	   Emil said an independent election team, drawn from
representatives from sociopolitical organizations and
non-governmental organizations, should be established to help the
government hold the general elections.
	   Frugality should be at the core of the polls in place of the
ostentatious frills normally found in a campaign, he added.
	   Setting a poll date approved by the public could create a much
needed ``atmosphere of certainty'' also required by the business
community as they sought stability to revive the country's sinking
economy.
	   In preparation for the expedited elections, Emil encouraged the
President to employ government decrees to change the current
electoral law, the law on social and political organizations and
the law on the status of the Assembly and the House.
	   ``The three government decrees, the date for the poll and the
general session should be set by the President after consulting
with public leaders,'' he said.
	   He encouraged the government to allow new political parties to
expand and campaign to recruit members once the decrees were
issued.
	   In closing, Emil called on the nation to also concentrate on
efforts to address critical issues of food scarcity and
unemployment. (aan)

No home for sculpture honoring pro-democracy victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A sculpture by a Danish artist honoring those
killed in the 1989 military crackdown in Beijing was hidden Friday
after villagers refused to store it in a container truck at a
carpark near their village.
	   The government-owned Radio Hong Kong said villagers feared the
scuplture would upset the ``feng shui'', or geomancy, of the area.
The ancient Chinese art is meant to balance humans with their
surroundings.
	   Radio Hong Kong quoted pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan as
saying that the scuplture will now be stored at some other carpark
but that its location would not be disclosed to avoid further
controversy.
	   Earlier this week, city officials refused to give the activists
space in any public parks or museum to display the eight-meter
(26-foot) bronze scuplture, known as the ``Pillar of Shame'' by its
creater Jens Galschiot.
	   Permission was granted only to allow it to be displayed for a
day on Thursday at Hong Kong's Victoria Park when about 40,000
people held a candelight vigil to mark the 9th anniversary of the
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in China.
	   The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Movement in
China, which organized the candlight vigil, had planned to store
the scuplture Friday in a container at a carpark in the New
Territories, bordering China.
	   The art work features 50 twisted faces symbolizing the pain of
the people, and carries a plaque reading: ``How can old people kill
the youth?''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Disappeared activist Rahardjo Waluyo Djati became
yesterday the third person to publicly recount his kidnapping,
which featured torture and interrogation about his political
activities and links.
	   Rahardjo, 28, a member of the National Committee for Democratic
Struggle (KNPD), said he was kidnapped here by several armed men on
March 12 and released on April 25.
	   ``They abducted me at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,'' the Gadjah
Mada University said.
	   Speaking before journalists at the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation (LBH) office in Central Jakarta, Rahardjo said he was
grabbed and then pushed into a red jeep with his head covered by a
black cloth.
	   He was taken to an unidentified location and placed inside a
building where he was tortured and interrogated for the first three
days.
	   ``I was beaten and given electric shocks just like Pius and
Desmon,'' Rahardjo said referring to Pius Lustrilanang and Desmon
J. Mahesa who were also separately abducted and went public with
their experiences.
	   Rahardjo said he was also forced to lie flat on his stomach on
an ice block for at least 10 minutes.
	   Among the information sought by his interrogators was the
whereabouts of activist Andi Arief from the outlawed Democratic
People's Party
	   ``In a weak and depressed state, I finally told them that maybe
they could find Andi in Lampung,'' Waluyo said.
	   As reported earlier, Andi was found in the custody of the
National Police on April 17, almost three weeks after he was
allegedly kidnaped in Lampung.
	   Andi told lawyers from the Commission for Missing Persons and
Victims of Violence (Kontras) that he was only handed over to the
police by his abductors on April 17.
	   Police however maintain that Andi had been in their custody
since March 29, a day after he disappeared, and was arrested for
his alleged involvement in a bomb explosion at a low-cost apartment
in Central Jakarta in January.
	   Rahardjo said he was also asked by his abductors whether retired
army general Benny Moerdani and business tycoon Sofjan Wanandi were
the financial backers of KNPD.
	   ``I told them that we financed the organization from our own
pocket money... Or even our parents' money,'' he said.
	   Sofjan was questioned by authorities in January after the
military claimed his name was found in a document confiscated from
the bombed apartment.
	   Rahardjo said during his captivity he could sometimes hear the
sounds of a people exercising. He said he believed them to be
soldiers.
	   He also said that during his captivity he spoke with a number of
activists, including Pius and Haryanto Taslam.
	   Kontras listed at least seven people as still missing: Yani
Avri, Sonny, Herman Hendrawan, Bimo Petrus Anugrah, Suyat, Noval
and Dedy Umar Hamdun, husband of actress Eva Arnaz. (byg)

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup looming, Air France officials
and pilots worked to end a strike that is already disrupting the
run up to the soccer championships that start next week. But a top
soccer official on Friday expressed confidence the sport would
prove stronger than strikes.
	   Railway conductors demanding higher pay called a work stoppage
until Saturday morning, forcing reduced service on numerous lines.
	   That was but the latest in a series of strikes fouling the run
up to the World Cup. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected
for the soccer championship, along with summer tourists.
	   The third round of talks between Air France and pilots' unions
at the company's Paris headquarters ended at 4:30 a.m. (0230 GMT)
after nearly 10 hours. There were no signs of an immediate
breakthrough as the strike entered its fifth day Friday.
	   A new round of talks was set for 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) Friday.
	   Sepp Blatter, Swiss candidate to head the world soccer governing
body, FIFA, said soccer would prevail.
	   ``I can assure you that football is stronger than all social
movements,'' he told a news conference. He said he had no doubt all
64 matches will be played ``and France will do everything so that
foreigners are warmly welcomed.''

	   THE Negri Sembilan FA (NSFA) have warned they will not hesitate
to act against those responsible in putting up banners criticising
coach M.
	   Karathu.
	   FA secretary Abdullah Sani Abdul Hamid said in Port Dickson
yesterday that they had received information on those behind the
act.
	   ``Although it is not official, the piece of information we have
is enough to inititate an internal inquiry against those behind
this cowardly act irrespective of whether they are players or
officials,'' he said.
	   Banners criticising Karathu first surfaced when Negri played
Pahang in Kuantan last Saturday and appeared again at the Paroi
Stadium last Tuesday.
	   Besides, it was also reported that certain players had
petitioned that the coach be removed. Abdullah Sani said the FA
were happy with Karathu's work and the question of his removal did
not arise.
	   ``I sincerely hope those who harbour ill feelings about the team
and Karathu refrain from indulging in unhealthy tactics.''
	   He said the players are paid to win their matches while the
officials should stay away from football politics which could
affect the team's performance.
	   ``If the players play well and win all their matches, certainly
their opinion about the coach will be heard but when they do not
play up to expectation, they only have themselves to blame and not
others,'' he said.
	   He warned the players that they were bound by their contracts to
play football and that they could be sacked if they acted beyond
that.
	   Meanwhile, State police chief SAC I Amiruddin Embi has football
fans to refrain from displaying banners with negative messages
which could lead to possible unrest during matches.
	   He said fans should uphold the spirit of sportmanship and to
give their undivided support to the State team.
	   He said if they were unhappy over things, the matter could be
raised to the parties concerned using the proper channel. Amiruddin
added that the police will not hesitate to seize banners with
negative messages.

	   The letter, signed by Surakarta branch chairman M. Sangida and
secretary Zaenal Ma'arif, was sent yesterday through the embassies
of the respective countries in Jakarta.
	   ``We hope that the heads of government we sent letters to will
freeze assets belonging to Soeharto and his family in their

	   GLOOMY prospects facing Hong Kong's hotel industry has forced
Wharf (Holdings) to abandon its plan to develop another luxury
hotel in its Harbour City complex in Tsim Sha Tsui.
	   The proposed hotel would have been Wharf's fourth Marco Polo
hotel in Hong Kong.
	   Confirming the change in plan, a Wharf spokesperson said
yesterday: ``The hotel sector is a very difficult market at this
time. Wharf Holdings analysed the market and decided not to proceed
with the plan to develop a fourth hotel.'' An office building will
instead be built on the site earmarked for the hotel which was
tentatively named Marco Polo Grand.
	   Under Wharf's original timetable, Marco Polo Grand was supposed
to open for business sometime in November next year and would form
part of the third tower of the group's massive Gateway II
redevelopment project in Tsim Sha Tsui. The redevelopment scheme,
which began in the fourth quarter of 1994, would be completed in
phases between 1998 and 1999.
	   In Wharf's 1996 annual report, chairman and chief executive
Gonzaga Li said a new world-class hotel, the Marco Polo Grand,
would be developed on the third tower of Gateway II.
	   ``The addition of the Marco Polo Grand Hotel to the development
underlines the close relationship between the group's property
investment and development interests and its hotels ownership and
management arms.'' Following the completion of Gateway II, Wharf
expects to see a total increase of almost 50 per cent in gross
floor area at Harbour City to over 8.1 million square feet
encompassing The Gateway, Ocean Terminal, Ocean Centre and Ocean
Galleries.
	   Gateway II will comprise 1.6 million square feet of Grade A
office and 400,000 square feet of retail space. It will also
contain 505 serviced apartments.
	   In an indication of the group's preference for an office
building instead of a new hotel amid gloomy prospects for this
sector, Mr Li said in Wharf's annual report last year that the
office component of Harbour City has been the profit centre of the
group.
	   Marco Polo marketing manager Juanita Lo declined to disclose the
estimated project cost of the proposed 330-room Marco Polo Grand
hotel.
	   But a hotel analyst estimated that when the proposed hotel was
completed, the project would have been valued at more than $300
million, based on an estimate of about $1 million per room.

EU grants dlrs 11.2 million for reforms in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday granted
dlrs 11.2 million to Georgia to help the former Soviet republic
carry out economic and democratic reforms.
	   Under a 1998 assistance program, the funds will be used to
develop energy and transport infrastructure, private enterprise and
human resources, a statement by the EU executive Commission said.
	   Another dlrs 4.2 million will go to specific projects, such as
improving statistics, city-twinning, educational and social
programs run by non-governmental organizations.
	   The aim ``is to assist and accelerate the transition of Georgia
toward a market economy and a fully developed democracy,'' the EU
statement said.
	   The latest package brings to dlrs 231 million the total amount
of grants the EU has made to the small Caucasus republic, icluding
humanitarian aid.
	   Georgia is recovering from conflicts with its breakaway
provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which declared
independence in, respectively, 1990 and 1992. New clashes broke out
in Abkhazia last month, in which at least 100 people died and many
thousands of Georgians were forced to flee their homes in the Black
Sea province.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  Ed: UPDATES with new deaths reported, other details.
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 50 Kosovo Albanians have
been killed and about 200 are missing since Serbian government
forces started an offensive in the independence-minded province a
week ago, an ethnic Albanian leader said Friday.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so Kosovo Albanians who trekked into neighboring Albania
overnight had reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people,
said to have died of exhaustion, and three small children. About
10,000 refugees are now gathered around Tropoja in northern
Albania.
	   In the reported government offensive in Kosovo, four villages
populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed, and another eight
badly damaged, said Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main party.
	   Sixteen other villages are deserted as residents fled, Cacaj
added.
	   He listed more than 50 dead and some 200 missing from the latest
offensive, concentrated around Decani, some 70 kilometers (45
miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Separately, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian
leaders in the province, said one Albanian was killed and two
wounded in fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina. It said Serb shelling continued in the
Decani area and around the town of Djakovica in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an Albanian woman wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast.
	   In Novi Poklek, a village much closer to Pristina, residents
said Serbian police attacked on Sunday, taking away some 25-30 men
after a four-hour blitz, Associated Press photographer Santiago
Lyon reported.
	   Three-quarters of the homes in the village, some 25 kilometers
(12 miles) west of Pristina, were burned and destroyed, Lyon said.
Residents said women and children had been allowed to flee. Only
about 15 people, mostly men, could be seen in the razed settlement
Friday.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts such as Cacaj's are impossible to verify independently,
as both Serbian police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation
Army _ fighting for independence _ block adequate access to
journalists and even humanitarian workers.
	   Kosovo Albanian leaders say information comes from individuals
who manage to pass Serbian roadblocks and reach Pristina.
	   Telephone access to the area of the offensive has been cut for
days.
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro, which with
Serbia, forms Yugoslavia.
	   There were conflicting reports of Serb casualties, with Cacaj
saying three policemen trying to loot a house had been shot dead by
its Albanian owner, and the Serb Media Center denying any officers
were killed or wounded.
	   In a separate report, the Media Center said that a Yugoslav army
general, Nebojsa Pavkovic, made a surprise visit to a
still-inhabited village in the area, Batusa, inviting any Albanians
who fled to return on condition armed men turn in weapons and halt
attacks on police and army. An unspecified number of villagers did
so and were given food by the army, said the Media Center.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The fate of Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad
Taib as Umno vice-president will depend on the outcome of his
declaration of assets to party president Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   ``We will give him the chance to declare his assets to the
president before acting further,'' Umno secretary-general Datuk
Sabbaruddin Chik said after the Umno management and disciplinary
committee meeting chaired by party deputy president Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim at the Treasury.
	   On reports that Muhammad had while in Brisbane, Australia, said
he had declared his assets to Dr Mahathir, Sabbaruddin said: ``That
is what he said, but we do not know whether it is true.''
	   Muhammad, as former Selangor Menteri Besar, was required to
submit his assets to Dr Mahathir, in his capacity as the Prime
Minister, every two years.
	   Sabbaruddin however said he was aware that most ministers in
Umno had declared their assets to Dr Mahathir either as party
members or due to their position in the Government.
	   Sabbaruddin added that pending the outcome of Muhammad's asset
declaration, his position as the party's vice-president will
remain.
	   ``He will, however, not attend the supreme council meeting on
June 8 as he is still on leave.
	   ``We will keep it that way until the assets declaration is
made.''
	   Sabbaruddin said the committee had also decided not to set any
deadline for Muhammad to declare his assets.
	   The Umno supreme council had on May 10 last year decided to
relieve Muhammad from his functions as Umno vice-president pending
the outcome of his court case in Australia.
	   Muhammad was acquitted on May 30 of two charges of falsely
declaring the money he took into Australia in December 1996 and
failing to declare more than A$1.2 million (RM2.9 million) when he
left the country.
	   Sabbaruddin said the Umno management and disciplinary committee
also decided to recommend to the supreme council the suspension of
Datuk Waad Mansor as Negeri Sembilan executive councillor and
Tampin Umno division chief.
	   Waad was charged in the Seremban Sessions Court on May 28 with
five counts of corruption. The case will be mentioned in the High
Court there on June 22.
	   Sabbaruddin said the committee had also looked into a report by
Sabah Umno about 11 of its members ``getting involved'' with Parti
Bersekutu Sabah and Parti Bersatu Sabah.
	   He said ``appropriate action'' against them will be recommended
to the supreme council if the report is found to be true.

Two U.S. marines charged with assault in Japan granted bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two U.S. marines arrested on charges of assaulting
a man outside of a night club in Okinawa were granted bail Friday,
a U.S. Marine Corps statement said.
	   Pfc. William Costello, of Howell, New Jersey, was handed over to
the U.S. military after paying the 1.7 million yen (dlrs 12,600).
Pvt. Rocky M. Stubbs of Coshocton, Ohio, did not pay and will
remain for now at a detention facility in Naha, Okinawa.
	   At their first hearing on Monday, both defendents pleaded
innocent to assaulting Maiku Nakada outside a bar in a Naha
entertainment district.
	   Stubbs acknowledged striking Nakada and Costello acknowledged
head butting, kicking and hitting the plaintiff in a March 7 brawl
over a cigarette, but they said they did so in self-defense.
	   The case has caught the attention of two U.S. senators and a
House of Representatives member who have written a letter
complaining to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto about the pair's
treatment by Japanese authorities.
	   The defendants' lawyer, Michael Griffith, said the two were
interrogated without legal representation and that they were
treated harshly during their detention.
	   The letter was signed by Sen. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat from
New Jersey, Sen. Mike Dewine, a Republican from Ohio, and Rep.
Christopher Smith, a Republican from New Jersey.
	   The Marine Corps statement says that Costello will now be kept
in pretrial confinement for previous military charges that include
underage drinking, importing anabolic steroids to Japan and
distributing steroids on the military base.
	   Sentencing in the assault case is expected in two weeks.

Moya reaches men's final by defeating Mantilla
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CORRECTS to Moya losing five points in 4th graf  
  By ROB GLOSTER  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carlos Moya, overcoming muggy conditions and a
patient fellow Spaniard, defeated Felix Mantilla 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2
Friday in the semifinals at the French Open.
	   Moya will play either another Spaniard, Alex Corretja, or Cedric
Pioline in Sunday's final. Pioline hopes to become the first
Frenchman to win at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.
	   Moya mixed his powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots
to throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third set. But Moya won the next five games, losing
just five points during that span, to take control of the match.
	   Moya got to match point with a 127-mph serve that handcuffed
Mantilla, then hit a 122-mph service winner to finish off the
2-hour, 42-minute match.
	   On Thursday, Monica Seles advanced to the French Open final for
the first time since 1992 and won for the first time against
Martina Hingis, yet showed none of the giddy enthusiasm she had as
a teen-ager.
	   Though Seles flashed a big smile after her 6-3, 6-2 victory in
the semifinals of the event she won three straight times in the
early 1990s, her success was tempered by playing in her first
tournament since her father died of cancer on May 14.
	   ``I do feel happy. I mean, it's really great. But I've tried to
keep a sense of balance,'' said Seles, who pumped her fist in
triumph after Thursday's win over the world's top-ranked woman.
``I'm still going to be missing people. Some things in my life are
not going to be better.''
	   She'll face Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Saturday's final. Sanchez
Vicario celebrated her 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport by blowing a kiss to her Yorkshire terrier in the
VIP box.
	   Seles is 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario, a two-time French Open
champion.
	   Seles is wearing her father's ring on a chain around her neck
and has worn black throughout the French Open. Although the outfit
was chosen before her father's death, she said the color is
fitting.
	   ``I'm really glad it's not a bright color, because it just feels
more appropriate,'' Seles said. ``I try to give respect to Dad.''
	   Seles, who slammed two-handed winners within inches of the
lines, lost all five previous matches against Hingis _ including a
loss in the semifinals here last year.
	   Hingis was overpowering in her run to the semifinals, not losing
a set in the tournament and having little trouble with
eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   But the sixth-seeded Seles was in control throughout, moving
Hingis all over the court with shots that skimmed just over the
net.
	   ``She just hits everything very hard and very aggressively from
every place on the court,'' Hingis said. ``Usually she makes more
mistakes or she gets a little bit tired, but today she just
didn't.''
	   Seles was the aggressor from the start, showing her intensity by
walking back on court first after every changeover. Hingis,
normally composed, scolded herself and bounced her racket on the
clay in frustration.
	   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive,'' Seles
said. ``I knew I had that in me. I wasn't sure if I could do that
today, but I really believed I could.''
	   Hingis won every Grand Slam tournament title last year except
the French Open, losing in the final to Iva Majoli. She said Seles,
who at 24 is seven years older than Hingis, ran her to exhaustion.
	   ``I was probably getting a little bit tired. She just made me
run, and she didn't make any mistakes,'' Hingis said. ``I guess she
surprised everybody.
	   ``I mean, she was around for quite a while, then all of a sudden
she was gone for years,'' Hingis added. ``And here she is back, in
better shape and probably better than ever.''
	   Seles was 17 when she won her first Grand Slam tournament title
at the 1990 French Open, the first of three straight championships
at Roland Garros. She ruled women's tennis in those years, her
victories punctuated with high-pitched grunts. Off the court, she
was a teen-ager with an infectious giggle.
	   But all that changed in April 1993, when a spectator came out of
the stands at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, and stabbed her in
the back. Seles didn't return to the tennis tour until August 1995,
and even then she was subdued and emotionally strained.
	   The last two years have been even tougher because of the failing
health of her father, Karolj, who until shortly before his death
was her only coach. She was at his side in Sarasota, Fla., when he
died.
	   ``Obviously, the last five years have been very difficult in
terms of walking on the court, while before I only had to worry
about winning or losing the tennis match,'' she said. ``It's not
the same as it was before the stabbing. It never will be, and I
don't want it to be.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The National Commission on Human Rights will soon
begin investigating reports that more than 39,000 Acehnese have
died in various military operations over the past decade and that
1,000 others are still in military detention in Indonesia's
westernmost province.
	   The commission will set up a fact-finding team by the end of
this month to probe the allegations, commission member B.N. Marbun
said when addressing dozens of Acehnese students who took the
reports to commission's office yesterday.
	   Marbun said the commission planned to meet Minister of Defense/
Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto to discuss the current
status of Aceh as a military operation region.
	   ``We will ask ABRI to pull out all soldiers deployed to crush
the separatist rebel movement, as well as lift the military
operation region status in the province,'' he said.
	   Along with Irian Jaya and East Timor, Aceh has been given a
special status of military operation region. It enable the army to
facilitate the suppression of separatism in the three provinces.
	   The Aceh students, who called themselves the Aceh
Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Forum, reported that at least
39,000 women in the province were widowed when their husbands were
shot to death in military operations between 1989 and 1998.
	   They did not say how they came up with their figures.
	   Armed Forces spokesman (ABRI) Brig. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan
told The Jakarta Post that ``even simple logics'' would say that it
was impossible for the military to kill that great number of
people.
	   He admitted there were military operations in the province, and
that some people might have died because they were caught in
crossfire, but ``none were shot at deliberately.''
	   Those who died were the side effects of the military operations,
he said, adding that all of the workers previously detained have
all been released.
	   Yesterday, student Abdul Gani Nurdin said: ``Those women's
husbands -- accused of being members of the separatist disturbance
group or GPK -- were killed in sadistic ways. Most of them were
executed without trial. Their bodies were dumped in roads to be
picked up by passers by.''
	   He said thousands of Acehnese were still going missing while
others were serving jail sentences in two prisons in Lhokseumauwe,
North Aceh, and in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.
	   ``The prisoners are serving between eight and 20 years for their
alleged involvement in the separatist movement,'' he said. He added
that many women have reported being raped by soldiers while their
husbands were being detained.
	   The students rejected that the victims and those who were
missing or jailed were members of the Aceh separatist movement,
saying they were peasants and mostly illiterate.
	   Sorrow
	   Two widows whose husbands were allegedly executed in a 1991
military operation in Pidie, North Aceh, joined the group of
students yesterday. They expressed their sorrow and urged the
government to investigate the alleged military brutality.
	   Ti Aminah said her husband, Muniruddin, was abducted by a group
of soldiers on April 27, 1991. On May 1, 1991, he was brought home
briefly before he was taken away again.
	   On May 7, 1991, he was found dead on a road near their village,
Cat Keng, in Bandar Dua district.
	   Ti Aminah said she herself was interrogated and intimidated by
the soldiers, and was told that her husband belonged to the
separatist group. ``They threatened to kill me if I took (my
husband's death) to court,'' she said.
	   Ti Aminah, a jobless 26-year-old mother of three sons, said her
complaints to the local administration and the military had thus
far been ignored.
	   Juariah, 41, said her husband was ``fetched'' by a group of men
in green fatigues when she was giving birth to her fifth son on May
2, 1991.
	   ``On July, 2, 1991, I heard from the local administration that
my husband had been given a mass burial along with five others,''
she said. She added she was made to pay Rp 50,000 (US$5 at the
current rate) for the burial.
	   The two widows urged the rights body to investigate ``the Aceh
genocide'' and to ask for ABRI's response to the allegations.
	   Fahmi Mada, a member of the Aceh NGO Forum, said that more than
1,000 of around 3,000 Acehnese workers deported by the Malaysian
government recently have been detained in military and police
detention houses in the province for their alleged links to the
Aceh separatist movement.
	   ``The arrests of the workers are groundless. And they cannot be
treated as political detainees because they are not GPK members,''
he said.
	   He acknowledged that many Acehnese people had escaped overseas,
including to Malaysia, South Korea and Brunei Darussalam because of
fears of persecution, torture, arrest and interrogation by local
military authorities over their alleged links to the separatist
movement.
	   During the Malaysian authorities' operations to deport illegal
migrants, thousands of whom were Indonesians working in plantation
sectors, a group of Acehnese refused to be shipped home, citing
persecution. Some forced their way into the local office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees seeking asylum. (rms)

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ International efforts to help
victims of the recent Afghan earthquake sputtered to a halt Friday
as heavy rains grounded helicopters intended to deliever food and
evacuate the injured.
	   The miserable weather dealt one more setback to the already
creaky operation to bring relief to the survivors of May 30 quake,
which is believed to have killed as many as 5,000 people and
injured thousands more in remote mountain villages in northern
Afghanistan.
	   Along with homes and family members, villagers have lost food
stocks and water wells. Some survivors haven't had anything to eat
since the quake struck.
	   The vast majority of damaged and destroyed villages are
accessible only by helicopter. The aid agencies have had only three
helicopters to ferry out the most severely hurt over the last four
days, and to start distributing flour and oil to the exhausted and
hungry.
	   But even those few helicopters have been unable to fly many
sorties due to a severe fuel shortage.
	   On Thursday, they delivered flour and oil to only a dozen
villages before returning to their base in Duchambe in neighboring
Tajikistan.
	   Hours later, a United Nations plane delivered a long-awaited
4,000 liters of fuel to aid headquarters in the provincial capital
of Faisabad, But rainstorms on Friday kept the helicopters from
returning.
	   Judging from the aid workers reception in the 12 villages on
Thursday, earthquake survivors were hungry and growing increasingly
desperate. They appealed for more food, water and material for
shelter.
	   Of the thousands believed injured, just 96 have been evacuated
for treatment. More than 100 villages are estimated to have been
damaged by the quake. Six days after the disaster, the vast
majority have yet to see a United Nations or Red Cross helicopter
land.
	   At the Faisabad airstrip, the center of the earthquake relief
operations, Afghan workers on Friday constructed a shed for aid
supplies that were to be flown in shortly by U.S.-leased planes.
Others struggled in the rain to anchor rugs and plastic over the
piles of flour sacks at each end of the runway, awaiting
distribution.
	   Saddiq Ahmed Kanju, the minister of state for foreign affairs,
landed Friday afternoon in Faisabad. He said he and his delegation
hoped to view the relief effort, but were stymied by the weather.
	   ``We've come to show our heartfelt condolences and grief at the
very sad event in our neighborhood,'' he said, adding that three
Pakistani C-130 aircraft already delivered rice to Faisabad.
	   However Kanju's first priority was apparently to try to further
an initiative to bring Afghanistan's warring parties to peace
talks.
	   On Thursday, he met with leaders of the Taliban movement in
Kandahar in the south. On Friday, he met with Afghanistan's deposed
president Burhanuddin Rabbani and leaders of the northern alliance
in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``We've always been encouraging both factions fighting in
Afghanistan to come together to find a solution,'' he told
reporters.
	   Rabbani was on Kanju's helicopter as well. Members of Kanju's
delegation said they stopped in Faisabad because their helicopter
was running low on fuel. They decamped into an Afghan cargo plane
that was on the runway to continue their journey back to Pakistan.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Women's rights group Mitra Perempuan said
yesterday it would conduct its own inquiry into numerous reports of
sexual abuse of women during the rioting last month.
	   The group's executive director Rita Serena Kolibonso told The
Jakarta Post it was prompted to launch its own investigation
because of the litany of reports of rape, abuse and public
humiliation of women, particularly those of Chinese descent.
	   She said the investigation would proceed despite the fact the
police had not registered any sexual abuse cases during riots which
swept through Jakarta and surrounding areas from May 13 to May 15.
	   ``We have found dozens of cases, but it could be more than 100
by the time we complete the investigation,'' Rita said.
	   Central Jakarta police chief Lt. Col. Iman Haryatna said there
had been no reports of riot-related sexual assaults, but invited
people to speak up with any complaints.
	   ``Don't hesitate to come forward, although we know that they
(sexual assault victims) are in a difficult situation.''
	   Rita said most of the assaults took place in West Jakarta, where
thousands of buildings were looted and burned in three days of
violence sparked by the fatal shooting of four Trisakti University
students by security forces on May 12.
	   In a statement made available here, the group said a mob
stripped and molested a number of Chinese-Indonesian women before
forcing them to swim in a stagnant pond in the Daan Mogot area.
	   It also said that an unspecified number of women were gang-raped
in front of a crowd in the city's commercial district of Glodok and
dozens of others were sexually harassed in their homes.
	   ``I believe that these brutal acts were done by an organized
group,'' Rita said.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights said Tuesday that it
would investigate reports of rape.
	   Commission member Clementino dos Reis Amaral said it would also
investigate reported cases of sexual abuse during recent riots in
the North Sumatra capital of Medan, the Central Java city of
Surakarta and East Java capital of Surabaya.
	   The commission said earlier this week that at least 1,188 people
were killed during the riots.
	   The figure is more than twice official estimates made by the
military, which the rights body accused of doing too little, too
late to quell the violence and save lives.
	   ``The commission had received reports of ... the killings of
1,188 people and 101 injuries along with some cases of rape,'' the
commission said in a report.
	   It said 40 shopping centers, 2,479 shop/houses and 1,604 shops
were attacked, burned or looted, along with 1,119 vehicles, 1,026
private homes and 383 offices.
	   It noted that security forces had failed to anticipate warning
signs rioting would erupt. Moreover, when the violence started
``there were no signs of serious efforts by the security forces to
prevent the spread of the rioting''.
	   The commission urged the government to ``thoroughly investigate
security apparatus for letting, not preventing or immediately
dealing with the riots''.
	   It also called for an inquiry into allegations that much of the
violence had been the work of ``well-organized groups who started
the rioting and burnings''.
	   In a three-page statement, the commission noted that
Chinese-Indonesians were frequent targets in the unrest.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Business leaders briefed President B.J. Habibie
yesterday on the critical condition of the economy and called for
more concerted efforts to revive the banking industry, the source
of lifeblood for economic activity.
	   The government needs to act quickly and firmly to lead the
banking industry out of its virtual paralysis, Aburizal Bakrie,
chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin)
told reporters after a meeting with Habibie at Bina Graha
presidential office.
	   ``The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) should be
further empowered to strengthen the problem banks currently under
its supervision and management,'' Aburizal added.
	   Aburizal led a large delegation of Kadin executives to a first
meeting with the President to appraise him of the dire economic
situation and to suggest ways of resolving the crisis.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics reported Monday that the
country's gross domestic product contracted 8.51 percent in the
first quarter and projected a total negative growth of more than 10
percent for the year.
	   Kadin suggested that the government select a number of private
and state banks, based on a set of criteria, to be quickly
developed into anchor banks which would be fully trusted
domestically and internationally.
	   ``These anchor banks could eventually be merged with the (54)
problem banks currently being restructured by IBRA,'' Aburizal
added.
	   Most Indonesian banks now face extreme financial difficulties as
a result of the 80 percent depreciation of the rupiah against the
American dollar.
	   High interest rates, a severe lack of liquidity and low capital
levels and huge bad loans are further crippling most banks and
consequently the corporate sector.
	   Analysts say most banks currently cannot extend loans and are
desperate to collect on outstanding loans so they can satisfy
depositor and creditor payment demands.
	   The central bank said that as of late last month it had pumped
more than Rp 124 trillion (US$12.4 billion) in liquidity credits to
banks facing severe liquidity problems.
	   Interest rate
	   Kadin suggested yesterday that the central bank lower its
benchmark interest rate from its current 58 percent level because
businesses could not handle such punitively high capital costs.
	   The chamber said the government and businesspeople, irrespective
of company size or ethnic group, should join hands in restoring
production and distribution facilities.
	   A large number of business establishments, including shops,
shopping malls and bank offices in Jakarta, its surrounding areas
and several provincial cities, were severely damaged from looting
and arson last month.
	   Most of the damages were inflicted upon the businesses of ethnic
Chinese businesspeople.
	   Aburizal added that Kadin supported the President's plan to
appoint special envoys with an ambassadorial rank from the private
sector with the specific task of restoring international confidence
in Indonesia's economic prospects and business sector. (vin)

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government says it is launching tough measures
to combat corrupt and collusive practices in the bureaucracy in a
bid to provide the public better services and to create a clean
administration.
	   Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and State
Administrative Reform Hartarto Sastrosoenarto told the media after
meeting with President B.J. Habibie yesterday that government
officials of all levels had been ordered to intensify the campaign
to fight corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   The aim is to ``create a clean and efficient government which is
free from corruption, collusion and nepotism'' and a bureaucracy
which ``gives its best services to society'', Hartarto said.
	   Shortly after he replaced Soeharto on May 21, Habibie promised
to improve the image of the government, which is seen as one of the
most corrupt in the world. Soeharto's fall was attributed by some
to his inability to curb corruption and control his children's
business ventures.
	   ``Our priority is to carry out reform in the government and
state administration,'' Hartarto said.
	   Hartarto said he would soon issue comprehensive criteria on what
actions constitute corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   He said government officials were not allowed to use their
authority to grant special privileges and facilities for their
relatives or friends to win government projects.
	   ``Special privileges include loans, tax breaks, monopolistic
facilities and the purchasing of state assets against prevailing
regulations,'' Hartarto said.
	   The minister, however, pointed out that relatives of any
government official should not be prohibited from conducting
business as long as they did so without receiving special
privileges from the official.
	   ``For instance, if the son of an official opens a school or a
Padang food restaurant or develops an industry or a real estate
business without a special facility and in line with the prevailing
laws, (he should be allowed to do so),'' Hartarto said.
	   ``The 1945 Constitution guarantees the freedom to earn a living
and to have a proper life,'' he said.
	   The minister also urged the media and the public to join the
campaign against corruption and report violations backed up with
strong evidence.
	   In a meeting with rectors of state and private universities from
across the country yesterday, Habibie underlined the importance of
setting up criteria of what constitutes corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   He cited his own experience with his two sons who complained
that they were being accused of obtaining their current positions
merely because they were the sons of the President.
	   ``If Father is president for a long time, I'd rather go abroad
and find a new job maybe in Europe or in Malaysia,'' Habibie quoted
one of his sons as saying.
	   Habibie's eldest son, Ilham, is an executive at the state
aircraft manufacturer PT IPTN in Bandung. Habibie was the president
of the company until his appointment as vice president in March.
	   ``My son asked me not to be president for long since he has
found it uncomfortable to work at IPTN because (people accuse him)
of nepotism,'' he said. (prb)

	   ENJOY the tournament.
	   This as the message given by Malaysian coach Lim Teong Kim to
his charges for the Under-15 Nike International Premier Cup which
begins today at the ITM Stadium.
	   He also said that the boys should use this tournament to gain
exposure from the other teams competing in the three-day
competition.
	   Malaysia open their campaign against neighbours Singapore in the
ITM Stadium at 7.30am today.
	   Lim did not comment on the match but Malaysia should go for
maximum points as they will have to meet two strong teams from
Group A, Japan and China.
	   Malaysia have already made an impact when they won both
categories in the skills competion held yesterday.
	   Striker Amir Shareen Abdul Mubin was chosen as the most skilfull
player while Kam Soon Hong was the best in goalkeeping skills.
	   Japan are represented by the youth side of the J-League team
Shimizu S- Plus, favourites China by Shanghai Oriental Pearl and
Singapore's representatives aare Jin Tai Secondary School.
	   The Chinese players were shocked when their passports and cash
worth US$1,300 (RM4,940) were missing yesterday.
	   The team officials have approached Asian Football Federation
(AFC) for assistance.
	   Group A: Malaysia, Japan, China, Singapore.
	   Group B: Philippines, South Korea, Thailand.
	   Today: Malaysia v Singapore (7.30am), South Korea v Thailand
(7.30am), Japan v China (8.45am).
	   Tomorrow: Malaysia v Japan (7.30am), China v Singapore (8.45am),
Thailand v Philippines (8.45am), China v Malaysia (4.0), Singapore

EU grants dlrs 11.2 million for reforms in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday granted
dlrs 11.2 million to Georgia to help the former Soviet republic
carry out economic and democratic reforms.
	   Under a 1998 assistance program, the funds will be used to
develop energy and transport infrastructure, private enterprise and
human resources, a statement by the EU executive Commission said.
	   Another dlrs 4.2 million will go to specific projects, such as
improving statistics, city-twinning, educational and social
programs run by non-governmental organizations.
	   The aim ``is to assist and accelerate the transition of Georgia
toward a market economy and a fully developed democracy,'' the EU
statement said.
	   The latest package brings to dlrs 231 million the total amount
of grants the EU has made to the small Caucasus republic, including
humanitarian aid.
	   Georgia is recovering from conflicts with its breakaway
provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which declared
independence in, respectively, 1990 and 1992. New clashes broke out
in Abkhazia last month, in which at least 100 people died and many
thousands of Georgians were forced to flee their homes in the Black
Sea province.

Architects of European single currency awarded social science

prize  

<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ The so-called ``parents of the euro'' _
European Commission President Jacques Santer and former Luxembourg
premier Pierre Werner _ shared one of Spain's prestigious Prince of
Asturias prizes Friday.
	   A statement released by the selection jury described Santer, 60,
and Werner, 84, as ``the architects'' of the single European
currency, or euro, which is the symbol of European Economic and
Monetary Union.
	   The jury said the prize, officially for contributions to social
science, recognized their contribution to what it termed ``one of
the continent's most decisive historical achievements.''
	   Santer presided over the birth of the euro in May when the 11
members of the European Union who will begin to use to single
currency in 1999 were elected.
	   Werner headed the commission of experts who conceived the first
formal plan for monetary union in Europe 28 years ago.
	   Both men have presided over the government of Luxembourg. Werner
headed governments between 1959 and 1974, and again between 1979
and 1984, when he was replaced by Santer. Santer resigned in 1995
to take over the presidency of the European Commission.
	   Taking their name from the heir to the Spanish throne, the
Prince of Asturias prizes are considered Spain's equivalent of
Nobel Prizes. Eight prizes are awarded each year.
	   The winners of the arts, communication and literature awards
have already been announced. The arts award went to Brazilian
photographer Sebastiao Salgado, German publisher Reinhard Mohn
received the honor for communication, Spanish writer Francisco
Ayala was awarded the literature prize and two Spanish physicists _
Pedro Miguel Etxenike and Emilio Mendez _ were chosen for the
science prize.
	   The other awards covering sports, international cooperation and
peace are scheduled to be announced in upcoming weeks.
	   All the prizes will be presented by Crown Prince Felipe of
Asturias at a ceremony in the fall in this northern city, the
capital of the Asturias region.
	   The awards include a cash prize of 5 million pesetas (dlrs
33,000) and a bronze statue designed by Catalan artist Joan Miro.

	   COMPETITION has intensified among deposit taking institutions,
with banks biting into the share of other market players.
	   The Asian financial crisis, according to a government official,
is taking market share away from deposit-taking companies (DTCs)
and Restricted Licence Banks (RLBs).
	   Most of the funds are going to banks which are offering
competitive rates.
	   Deposits with RLBs fell 18.5 per cent to $42.31 billion in the
first quarter from the previous quarter, and by 4.7 per cent from
the same period in 1997.
	   The government's 1998 First Quarter Economic Report showed that
deposits with DTCs dropped by 13.7 per cent to $12.53 billion from
the previous quarter, and by 18.4 per cent from the same period in
1997.
	   DTCs and RLBs can accept only wholesale deposits of at least
$100,000 for a minimum period of three months.
	   Deposits with licensed banks grew 2.3 per cent to $2.66 trillion
in the first quarter from the previous quarter and by 7.1 per cent
from the same period last year.
	   Bank analysts said the sharp increase in bank deposits and the
drop in deposits with RLBs and DTCs was due to keen competition for
deposits during the first quarter arising from fears over the Asian
financial crisis.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Udayana Regional Military Commander, Maj. Gen.
Yudomo Sastrosuhardjo, and Col. Salamat Sidabutar, the chief of the
Wira Dharma Military Command in East Timor, were killed yesterday
when their helicopter crashed near Liaruca village in East Timor.
	   Army spokesman Brig. Gen. I Dewa Putu Rai confirmed that all 12
aboard the Bell 205 helicopter were killed.
	   He said the crash occurred at 10:21 a.m. local time, immediately
after the aircraft took off from Liaruca, in mountainous regency of
Viqueque, 197 kilometers east of Dili, in relatively bad weather.
	   Yudomo and his entourage were on a three-day working visit to
several East Timor towns and villages after his appointment as the
new head of the Udayana Regional Military Command on May 27.
	   The Udayana Military Command oversees Bali, East and West Nusa
Tenggara and East Timor.
	   ``Earlier today, Maj. Gen. Yudomo visited Baucau regency before
leaving for Liaruca, Viqueque,'' Putu Rai said.
	   He was quick to dismiss speculation that the accident was
connected to or caused by East Timor separatists still active in
the area.
	   ``The helicopter crash was a pure accident,'' he said.
	   Asked about the exact cause of the accident, Putu Rai said an
Army team was now at the crash site conducting an investigation.
	   Also killed in the accident were the pilot, Capt. Kusmayadi;
copilot, Capt. Mawi Asmawi; assistant for intelligence affairs to
the Udayana Military Command chief of staff, Col. Pangandaran
Napitupulu; assistant for operations to the Udayana Military
Command chief of staff, Col. Satria Buana; and operational staff
members of the East Timor Military Command, Col. Jodi Kusuma and
Lt. Col. Simson G. Sigar.
	   Also listed in the flight manifest were East Timor Military
spokesman Capt. Muhammad, Yudomo's adjutant Second. Lt. Arifin and
two flight technicians, Chief Sgt. Supardi and First Sgt. Sutarjo.
	   Putu Rai said 11 died immediately and Muhammad passed away as he
was being evacuated from the scene.
	   Some of the bodies, including Yudomo's, are due to arrive at the
Halim Perdanakusuma Airbase today. However, as of late yesterday
evening, no decision had been taken on where the bodies will be
buried.
	   Career
	   Yudomo, arrived in Dili Wednesday and was due to return to
Denpasar, Bali, today.
	   Eight days ago he replaced Maj. Gen. Syahrir M.S. as head of the
Udayana Military Command. Syahrir took over command of the Army's
special force (Kopassus).
	   Yudomo, a 1971 graduate of the National Military Academy, spent
most of his career in Kopassus. He continued his military service
in various regional military commands and joined military
operations against separatist movement activities in East Timor and
Irian Jaya.
	   He has also served military postings in Pakistan and India.
	   Yudomo was appointed chief of staff of the Jakarta Garrison in
1996 and assigned intelligence duties as assistant for security
affairs to the Army chief last year.
	   Yudomo, 49 years old, is survived by his wife Sri Mulyaningsih
and two daughters. His third child, a son, died four years ago.
	   Condolence were sent yesterday by Dili Bishop Carlos Filipe
Ximenes Belo and the chairman of the East Timor chapter of the
Indonesian Council of Ulemas, Abdullah M. Sagran.
	   ``As an individual and on behalf of East Timor's religious
community, I'd like to send condolences to Maj. Gen. Yudomo and his
entourage,'' Belo said, as quoted by Antara.
	   ``Hopefully, God may bless all the victims and provide physical
and mental strength to their relatives,'' he added. (imn)

	   FORMER Selangor team manager Datuk Mohamed Aini Taib strongly
feels that the current Pro-League management should be given the
chance to prove themselves.
	   The fans have been pressing for the removal of team manager
Datuk Mokhtar Ahmad's and FAS vice-president Zaini Idris, blaming
them for the team's poor showing.
	   However, Aini, who is the FAS president, said he was far from
happy with the team's performance and said that he was shocked
Selangor were struggling at this stage.
	   Aini promised the fans that he will do all he can to rectify the
matter as soon as possible.
	   Aini spoke to the 100-odd fans who had met him at the Subang
Airport on Wednesday when he returned with the national Under-16
from Yangoon.
	   Selangor finally won a match under new coach Ismail Zakaria when
they beat Sabah 1-0 in Kota Kinabalu last Tuesday after failing to
win their five previous matches.
	   Selangor are now 10th in the league and third from the bottom.
It is their worst performance at the halfway mark since 1992.
	   ``I cannot imagine Selangor can be so low in the league. In my
five terms as a manager, the team were never in this position,''
said Aini.

	   TOKYO, Thurs: Countries where currency traders operate should
place restrictions on their activities that can bring down whole
economies, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.
	   He said these countries must ask themselves what benefit
currency volatility will bring, and whether it contributes anything
to the wellbeing of the world.
	   ``I don't think so. A whole region which is prosperous has been
made poor because currencies are no longer stable. If you think
that is not good, you must think of something that you must do to
restore the situation before, or to create a new and better
condition after,'' Dr Mahathir said.
	   Fielding questions after delivering the keynote address at the
Nihon Keizei Shimbun International Conference on ``The Future of
Asia'' here today, the Prime Minister was asked how the herd
mentality of currency traders could be controlled.
	   He said if these countries feel that people who have the means
to make the most amount of money must not be obstructed in any way,
even if they cause revolutions and unemployment for millions, then
economic turmoil and currency instability will continue forever.
	   ``Because these people can only make money if there is
instability. They do not reward governments by making currencies
stable. By rewarding the governments with currency stability they
would be depriving themselves of a chance to make profit.
	   ``So they will not regulate themselves. Governments can regulate
them, and the governments of the countries where they operate them
can regulate them. Even if they operate offshore we think there are
means of regulating them,'' Dr Mahathir added.
	   Asked by one participant whether this new capitalism is
practised differently in the US, Europe or Japan, the Prime
Minister said there is no difference where it is practised.
	   ``What may happen is that in order to grow bigger, all of them
will coalesce and become huge, and that has its own momentum which
you cannot stop. When they are so big that they can influence
governments and push aside small governments, then there really
will be no democracy in this world,'' he said.
	   Asked if a new round of crisis may be triggered when similar
South-East Asian industries produce more than what is needed by the
market, he said the proportions of such a crisis will not be very
big.
	   ``A few people will go down and that will do people no harm.
That will teach people a lot of lessons. But just imagine if we
have only three huge steel companies in the world and because they
don't cooperate with each other, they produce more than is
required,'' Dr Mahathir said.
	   He said he would rather see a situation where the collapse of
small companies will not affect the whole world, or even the
performance of a country.
	   ``But if one of three giant steel companies of the world
produces a few million tonnes and cannot sell the steel, the
company will collapse and will drag down banks and governments
along with it.
	   ``So we have a choice there, either we allow small companies or
we have only giant companies in this world,'' he added.
	   On the possibility of a common currency for Asia, Dr Mahathir
said this is not something that is easily implemented. There are
other ways for Asian countries to trade without using a common
currency.
	   Asked whether he feels the change in the Indonesian Government
will be good or bad for the region's economic recovery, Dr Mahathir
said mere change of government does not mean things will improve.
	   ``Indonesia is very much in need of funds, and the International
Monetary Fund has promised to give them US$3 billion (US$1   
RM3.96). But this was made conditional upon Indonesia stabilising
itself. One of the things that it must do is change governments,
which Indonesia has done. But funds are still withheld.''
	   As a result he said, people in Indonesia will not have enough
food, medicine, or milk for their children. They will be angry with
the Government and there will be instability.
	   ``And when there is instability the international agencies will
say `We will not release money to you because you are unstable'. We
have to decide to break this cycle. You have to give them the money
now that they have changed their government. You have to take the
new government on trust.You cannot always be suspicious,'' he said.
	   On the spread of nuclear arms in Asia, Dr Mahathir said Malaysia
is against nuclear weapons no matter who owns them.

	   SELANGOR got a reprieve after winning their first match in six
outings on Tuesday. But their troubles are far from over.
	   Fans who openly showed their displeasure with the team
management last week went one step further on Wednesday night when
they turned up in numbers to welcome FA of Selangor president Datuk
Aini Taib at Subang airport. They also demanded that he take over
as team manager from Datuk Mokhtar Ahmad.
	   Aini, on FA of Malaysia duty as team manager of the national
Under-16 team at the Asian Pacific qualifying tournament, returned
from Yangon.
	   The fans have also sent letters to the media and many of their
fans.
	   Worst, there is infighting within the Selangor Soccer Fan Club,
thrice voted the best in the country. Some club members have said
they do not recognise the body anymore.
	   On top all that, several senior players received show-cause
letters yesterday. The senior players who had lost their places in
the first-11 were given verbal warnings last week.
	   In the show-cause letter, the FAS had demanded explanation from
the players why they have been playing below par and behaving
poorly when they were benched.
	   Among the players who have lost their places are Assroff
Hanapiah, Shahril Arsat, Abdul Hadi Tahir, Nazzab Hidzan and Rusdi
Suparman.
	   Mokhtar remained cool yesterday and said they have taken steps
to ensure that the players in the team buck up.
	   But he denied the team management had tried to get support from
their affiliates to stage a vote of no-confidence against Aini last
week.
	   ``This is rubbish. I don't think any of us want the president's
job. We agreed that Aini is still the best man to run the
association,'' said Mokhtar.
	   ``As for the team, I'd like to finish the job.''
	   Mokhtar said he is ready to meet the fans anytime during
Selangor's training sessions in Kelana Jaya.
	   ``This episode is getting out of hand because of some people who
are unhappy with the present situation.''
	   Mokhtar said he will not quit under pressure: ``I'm no Raja
Ahmad Zainuddin (Perak team manager) to quit in that manner. I'll
not leave the side because the fans demand it.''
	   Mokhtar said they have dropped the idea of moving Selangor's
home matches from Shah Alam Stadium to Merdeka Stadium.

	   HONG Kong unit trusts suffered from a net outflow of US$49.18
million (HK$384 million) in April as the Asian financial crisis
reasserted itself, according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (HKIFA).
	   The net outflow in April reversed net inflow of US$93.8 million
in March when the financial crisis stabilised, according to a
survey by the HKIFA.
	   Total unit trust sales plunged 25 per cent to US$294.92 million
during the month as liquidity tightened in the region.
	   ``The drop in sales in April is understandable in view of the
concerns over the weakening economy in Japan, the tight monetary
conditions in Asia,'' said HKIFA chairman Peter Lord.
	   Investors continued to put their money into European equities as
a result of poor market conditions in Asia.
	   European equity funds attracted the highest gross and net
inflows during April.
	   Gross inflows into European equity funds amounted to US$89.42
million, 30.2 per cent of the fund management industry's gross
sales for the month.
	   Net inflows into European equity funds amounted to US$42.83
million during the same period.
	   Mr Lord said this is the first time since last July that
European equity funds have managed to attract the highest monthly
net inflows and three consecutive months of inflows.
	   The reason for the strong result is that investors have become
aware of the robust performance of most European markets when
compared with their Asian counterparts, Mr Lord said.
	   As at the end of April, the median one-year return of European
equity funds, including UK funds, was 42.69 per cent, with the
highest at 52.99 per cent and the lowest of 33.91 per cent.
	   In contrast, inflows into Asia-Pacific funds reached only
US$53.27 million.
	   This is much lower than the inflows of US$144.53 million in
March, which accounted for 36.7 per cent of the total during that
month.

	   FORMER state players Sazali Saad and Norlizam Ali yesterday sued
the Perlis Football Association for terminating their contracts
last February without any good reason.
	   In their originating summons filed in the Kangar High Court,
Sazali, 34, and Norlizam, 22, named Perlis FA president Datuk Seri
Shahidan Kassim and secretary Faezan Omar as defendants. Shahidan
is also the Menteri Besar while Faezan is Deputy State Secretary.
	   The two players, represented by Jamil Mohamad Shafie, are
seeking a court declaration that the termination of their contracts
is unlawful and the termination notice dated Feb 13, 1998 is null
and void.
	   They want the court to declare that they are still under the
employment of Perlis FA and entitled to monthly salaries and
emoluments now enjoyed by other players.
	   Both also want the FA to pay legal costs and other relief the
court deems fit.
	   The players claimed there had been a breach of natural justice
as the defendants had failed to give them an opportunity to speak
against the termination.
	   In his affidavit, Sazali, who now sells nasi lemak to support
his family, said he accepted the FA's offer on Dec 17, 1997 of a
two-year contract with a monthly salary of RM3,900.
	   Unemployed Norlizam, in his affidavit, said he accepted a
one-year playing contract with a RM1,000 monthly salary.
	   On April 11, after their contracts were terminated, the two
players said they issued their respective statements of claim to
the FA but these were ignored by the association.
	   Sazali demanded RM72,600 in compensation and Norlizam RM50,000.
	   Prior to filing the originating summons in the High Court, both
applied to withdraw their legal action against the FA filed earlier
in the Session's Court - with the liberty to file a fresh one in
another court.
	   It was granted by Session's Court Judge Ridwan Ibrahim.

	   THE appreciation of the US dollar will enable wooden and glass
door manufacturer Golden Pharos Bhd to maintain its financial
performance for the current financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   This confidence is supported by the group's continuous efforts
to open up new overseas markets while reducing operations costs and
increasing production efficieny.
	   ``The depreciation of ringgit against US dollar during the third
quarter of last year has been good for the group,'' says chairman
Datuk Seri Mohd Azahar Othman as the group is export oriented and
products are all quoted in US dollars.
	   Golden Pharos posted a group pre-tax loss of RM12.93 million for
the financial year ended December 31 1997, compared to a loss of
RM5.03 million recorded for a period between July 1 1995 and
December 31 1996.
	   Turnover was RM141.84 million compared to RM275.83 million - for
one and a half-year period - as at end of 1996. Loss after tax was
RM19.06 million compared to RM12.79 million in the previous year.
	   Loss per share was 16.4 sen compared to the previous 11.1 sen.
	   Commenting on it's financial results Azahar says that the group
loss after tax was higher compared to the previous year due to the
provisions made on the doubtful debts and the write off of
investment in its associated company in the US.
	   In the group's latest annual report, Azahar says that measures
taken by Golden Pharos last year has helped the group to add more
value to its products.
	   These include the focusing on its high-end doors and
strengthening its existing export market namely Japan, Italy, Spain
and France.

	   THEIR reign at the top only lasted one week. In fact, 14 days
after being the world No 1 pair, Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock
are now ranked fourth.
	   That is probably due to the fact that Yap had been troubled by a
sore shoulder throughout the Thomas Cup Finals in Hong Kong last
month.
	   In fact, Yap had also been undergoing intensive treatment at the
National Sports Council (NSC) medical unit since he returned last
week.
	   According to Yap, he is on the mend and believed that he and
Cheah will once again be among the top three in the world, starting
with the Malaysian Open in Penang next month.
	   Yap said he was not at his best at the Thomas Cup Finals because
his lack of match practise but it will be a different story at
Malaysian Open because he and Cheah will have at least four more
weeks to prepare for the Penang tournament.
	   Cheah and Yap last won the the Malaysian Open in 1996 when they
beat Choong Tan Fook-Lee Wan Wah in the final.
	   But the opposition this time will be tougher for all the top
pairs in the world are expected to compete in Penang, including
Koreans of Lee Dong Soo-Yoo Yong Sung, the All-England champions,
and the impressive pair of Ha Tae-Kwon-Kang Kyung-jin.
	   Indonesian doubles stars Sigit Budiarto-Chandra Wijaya and Rexy
Manaiky- Ricky Subagja are also expected to compete.
	   Yap said presence of the top five pairs in Penang will make
their job tough but is confident that they can win their first
title since winning at the Japan Open in January.
	   ``I know I did not play up to expectation. But the shoulder
injury was hindering my progress,'' said Yap.
	   ``It was not very bad but at that level it was really bad. I
thought I could overcome it but I was wrong.
	   ``But I'm thankful the national coaches have given me a lot of
rest and I believe I will be back at my best soon.''
	   His partner Cheah, the national skipper who had a fine outing in
Hong Kong, said he hopes to have the kind of run he had with Soo
Beng Kiang in 1992.
	   That time, the two won the World Cup, Malaysian Open, Indonesian
Open and United States Open within the space of two months.
	   ``I believe if Yap and I have no injury problems then we can
beat anyone in the world. And I'm sure we will get it right in the
Malaysian Open.''

	   THE Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) said yesterday
a sustained improvement in employment prospects and a consequent
reduction in the unemployment rate can only be achieved with
greater wage restraint and a return to positive growth.
	   ``The chamber appreciates the strategy behind the 12 measures
announced by the government on Wednesday aimed at creating 100,000
new jobs in the private and public sectors this year, but it
recognises these moves are likely to be limited in their effect and
the job numbers are difficult to achieve,'' it said in a statement.
	   Dr Eden Woon, director of HKGCC, said unless the present rapid
growth in the workforce slowed substantially, even the creation of
100,000 jobs a year would either leave unemployment at its present
levels or result in a further rise.
	   He added that a number of measures proposed by the government
this week, including advancing the start-up dates for public sector
projects and strengthening government job programs, were included
in the chamber's own submission on unemployment sent to the
government last Monday.
	   ``But the chamber's submission goes further, recognising that
without more dramatic action, including a wage freeze, and an
overall faster pace of economic growth, the jobs situation cannot
be easily stabilised and turned around,'' Mr Woon said.
	   According to HKGCC's submission, attention should focus on the
needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which employ some 60
per cent of Hong Kong's workforce.
	   Among other measures, HKGCC proposed banks should be encouraged
to cut interest rates when conditions allow.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - A programme for hydroponic cultivation on a
commercial basis will be introduced nationwide to increase food
production and to reduce the import of vegetables.
	   The programme, to be formulated under the umbrella concept, will
be undertaken by Golden Farm Hidroponic Sdn Bhd, which will also
market the produce both domestically and abroad.
	   State Agriculture Committee chairman Datuk Ramly Zahari said
this was the first attempt to assist entrepreneurs with hydroponic
cultivation.
	   ``Golden Farm has the expertise in the cultivation of hydroponic
vegetables.
	   ``The company also has vast experience in advanced and modern
planting techniques which can enhance the planting of vegetables
using the hydroponic method,'' he said.
	   He was speaking to newsmen after opening a seminar on the
production and marketing strategies of hydroponic products, on
behalf of Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib today.
	   The one-day seminar, organised by the State Economic Planning
Unit, was attended by some 200 participants nationwide.
	   Ramly said Golden Farm would also offer technical advice to
interested parties wanting to start up a hydroponic vegetable farm.
	   He also said entrepreneurs need not worry about how to market
their produce as the company would offer a sales contract after the
vegetables had been harvested.
	   In a related development, Ramly said the hydroponic pilot
project introduced by the State Government had shown good results.
	   Since the project started in February, more than 15,000
hydroponic kits had been distributed to individuals and
organisations.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ International efforts to help
victims of the recent Afghan earthquake sputtered to a halt Friday
as heavy rains grounded helicopters intended to deliver food and
evacuate the injured.
	   The miserable weather dealt one more setback to the already
creaky operation to bring relief to the survivors in the May 30
quake, which is believed to have killed as many as 5,000 people and
injured thousands more in remote mountain villages in northern
Afghanistan.
	   Along with homes and family members, villagers have lost food
stocks and water wells. Some survivors haven't had anything to eat
since the quake struck.
	   The vast majority of damaged and destroyed villages are
accessible only by helicopter. The aid agencies have had only three
helicopters to ferry out the most severely hurt over the last four
days, and to start distributing flour and oil to the exhausted and
hungry.
	   But even those few helicopters have been unable to fly many
sorties due to a severe fuel shortage.
	   On Thursday, they delivered flour and oil to only a dozen
villages before returning to their base in Duchambe in neighboring
Tajikistan.
	   Hours later, a United Nations plane delivered a long-awaited
4,000 liters (1,050 gallons) of fuel to aid headquarters in the
provincial capital of Faisabad, But rainstorms on Friday kept the
helicopters from returning.
	   Judging from the aid workers reception in the 12 villages on
Thursday, earthquake survivors were hungry and growing increasingly
desperate. They appealed for more food, water and material for
shelter.
	   Of the thousands believed injured, just 96 have been evacuated
for treatment. More than 100 villages are estimated to have been
damaged by the quake. Six days after the disaster, the vast
majority have yet to see a United Nations or Red Cross helicopter
land.
	   At the Faisabad airstrip, the center of the earthquake relief
operations, Afghan workers on Friday constructed a shed for aid
supplies that were to be flown in shortly by U.S.-leased planes.
Others struggled in the rain to anchor rugs and plastic over the
piles of flour sacks at each end of the runway, awaiting
distribution.
	   Saddiq Ahmed Kanju, the minister of state for foreign affairs,
landed Friday afternoon in Faisabad. He said he and his delegation
hoped to view the relief effort, but were stymied by the weather.
	   ``We've come to show our heartfelt condolences and grief at the
very sad event in our neighborhood,'' he said, adding that three
Pakistani C-130 aircraft already delivered rice to Faisabad.
	   However Kanju's first priority was apparently to try to further
an initiative to bring Afghanistan's warring parties to peace
talks.
	   On Thursday, he met with leaders of the Taliban movement in
Kandahar in the south. On Friday, he met with Afghanistan's deposed
president Burhanuddin Rabbani and leaders of the northern alliance
in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``We've always been encouraging both factions fighting in
Afghanistan to come together to find a solution,'' he told
reporters.
	   Rabbani was on Kanju's helicopter as well. Members of Kanju's
delegation said they stopped in Faisabad because their helicopter
was running low on fuel. They moved into an Afghan cargo plane that
was on the runway to continue their journey back to Pakistan.

	   IT will take sometime before government measures aimed at
stimulating Hong Kong's property market can have any impact on the
secondary market, according to property agents.
	   ``In short term, the secondary property market would progress in
a gradual manner, but a drastic increase in transactions was not
expected,'' said Wong Wai-ming, senior manager at Midland Realty
agent.
	   ``The focus of the property market is still on new properties,''
said a Centaline property agent.
	   On Friday, the government eased measures originally aimed at
curbing property speculation and moved to boost bank liquidity to
help home buyers secure mortgages and to stimulate the sale of
flats.
	   Mr Wong said the new measures had some positive effects on the
market with some people showing signs of interest.
	   ``The number of people visiting flats has increased by 30 per
cent,'' he said.
	   Hui Wai-bond, sales manager of estate agent Centaline Property,
said market sentiment improved after the government announcement.
	   ``Many owners of Dawning Views want to sell their flats in the
secondary market,'' Mr Hui said.
	   However, he said the price of second-hand flats should be above
$3,300 per square foot.
	   ``As the average price of new flats are approximately $3,000
only, the secondary market for Dawning Views lacks support,'' he
said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - This year's week-long Flora Fest, to be
held from July 5, will be watched by about 40,000 visitors and
feature 10 floats representing various government and corporate
organisations.
	   Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik said
the theme for the event this year would be ``Games and Pastimes''.
	   It will be the eighth floral fest to be held since the event was
first held in 1991.
	   Speaking at a Press conference today at the Putra World Trade
Centre here, Sabbaruddin said that this year's fest would have
fewer activities, such as competitions to decorate shopping malls
and hotels, due to the economic situation.
	   He added that with the 25 per cent increase in prices of cut
flowers, many of the shopping malls and hotels were unable to bear
the additional cost.
	   ``Some of them will do it in a small way by having decorations
in their premises.''
	   The organisations that have agreed to participate in the parade
are the Johor Government, Malaysia Airlines, Kuala Lumpur Tourist
Association, Kuala Lumpur City Hall, Negri Sembilan Government,
Pahang Government, Shah Alam Municipal Council, Penang Government,
KFC Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd and Pempena Sdn Bhd.
	   ``We hope that the activities planned for the fest will serve as
an attraction and encourage tourists to visit Malaysia,''
Sabbaruddin said.
	   To allow members of the public to get a closer look at the
floats, a two-day static exhibition will be held from July 5 at
Tapak Pasar Tani, Jalan Ipoh.
	   To encourage the public to visit the fest, special domestic tour
packages have been developed with the co-operation of KTM Bhd and
Transnasional Express Bus.
	   Hotels like Stanford, Grand Centre Point and City Villa will
also participate in the packages formulated for this event.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - One of two gunmen assaulted the assistant
manager of a Hong Leong Bank branch during a RM100,000 robbery in
Setapak today.
	   In the incident, the gunman pistol-whipped the unidentified
executive as he was slow in responding to his demands for money.
	   The 30-year-old victim was taken to a private clinic for
treatment for head injuries.
	   The robbery, in which the gunmen had another accomplice armed
with a parang, occurred about 11.30am.
	   City deputy Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant
Commissioner Baharin Idrus said the robbers, who wore crash helmets
during the robbery, escaped on two motorcycles.
	   Today's incident was the sixth at a Hong Leong Bank branch where
robbers have escaped with a total of about RM734,000, since early
this year.
	   On Jan 6, gunmen robbed a Hong Leong Bank branch in Taman OUG,
Jalan Klang Lama, of about RM100,000.
	   On Feb 3, a gang of robbers struck the bank's Shah Alam branch
and escaped with about RM45,000.
	   A day later, the bank's Taman Kinrara branch was hit by robbers
who grabbed RM170,000 and held two of its staff hostage.
	   On Feb 20, the bank's branch in Jalan Ipoh was robbed of about
RM19,000.
	   On May 6, robbers struck the bank's branch Taman Connaught,
Cheras, and escaped with about RM300,000.
	   In Petaling Jaya, police today detained four teenagers for
allegedly robbing two petrol stations and a convenience store in
Taman SEA, over the past two days.
	   The robberies were believed to have been carried out between
10pm yesterday and 12.15am today.
	   The four, aged between 15 and 18, were in a car when a police
patrol car cornered their vehicle in Kelana Jaya, shortly after
midnight, according to district police chief, Senior Assistant
Commissioner (II) Ahmad Fuaad Sidek.

Aegean security depends on Turkey, Greece says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The success of NATO-backed
confidence-building measures on sharing the Aegean Sea depends on
Turkey upholding its end of the bargain, Greece's foreign minister
said Friday.
	   ``From our side, I have confidence that we will do everything
possible to uphold the agreement,'' Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said. ``As for the other side, I hope _ because that's all
I can do _ that they display equivalent behavior.''
	   The measures, presented by NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
in Brussels on Thursday, are based on a 1988 Greek-Turkish
agreement that was never fully implemented.
	   At the time, both countries agreed to respect each other's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and rights to use Aegean waters
and international airspace.
	   The accord also called for a moratorium on military maneuvers in
the Aegean during July and August. Both Turkey and Greece hold
regular exercises in the area, where they have come to the brink of
war twice in the past 11 years over territorial disputes.
	   Pangalos blamed Turkey for the breakdown of the original
confidence-building measures.
	   ``There is a troubled past,'' the foreign minister said, adding
that the failure of the 1988 agreement stemmed ``from an attempt to
tie other disputes into the specific issues being discussed.''
	   The accord collapsed following accusations of air and sea space
violations by both sides. The only part upheld was a moratorium on
military exercises during the summer tourist season.
	   This time, success depends on Turkey putting into practice what
it has signed, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   ``This is a good first step, but it's not enough,'' he
explained. ``It has to be put into practice with respect for the
national integrity and independence of both countries.''
	   The Turkish foreign ministry on Thursday welcomed the agreement,
saying it could ``contribute to a peaceful solution to all problems
between the two countries.''

	   President B.J. Habibie has been surprisingly generous to the
foreign media. If it were only so with the local news media as
well.
	   Habibie's recent statement to The New York Times saying that he
had a better feel for the younger generation than his predecessor,
Soeharto, sounds a little ironic. The fact that the new President
has stood aloof from the local media and has yet to talk
face-to-face with ordinary Indonesians -- much less, the students
whose reform ideas he had rejected until the eleventh hour of
Soeharto's rule -- is no secret.
	   What Habibie should understand is that his pretentious show,
illustrated in a recent exclusive interview with the Cable News
Network, does little to inspire respect from the people.
	   Since his appointment as the country's third head of state on
May 21, Habibie seems to have been confused as to where to put the
local media and the people within his format. What we have seen is
that he prefers to have his ministers or anybody who comes to pay
him a courtesy call to act as his spokesperson. Such visitors
include, among others, reform advocate Amien Rais, House Speaker
Harmoko and leaders of religious groups.
	   This communication style looks rather odd in this age of modern
mass communications. The President may be copying the style of his
predecessor -- Soeharto never held regular media conferences during
his 32 years in power -- though Habibie certainly has a better
capability to talk to the foreign media.
	   Having watched Habibie's peculiar style since taking the
presidency, this newspaper has tried to advise him to modernize his
approach. Should he be too busy to talk to the public directly, he
could hold a news conference, for example. If he had no time for a
conference, he could grant interviews with a limited a number of
local editors.
	   A Habibie watcher said recently that since starting his new job,
the scientist we once knew had changed: The President had now
started to read newspapers, a thing he was reluctant to do before.
Upon hearing this, many now believe that this significant change
might lead to something else positive: the ability to listen to
other people.
	   We, too, believed that Habibie's reluctance to listen to others
may have become a thing of the past until we heard an account
signaling otherwise from the leaders of the Catholic Bishops
Conference. At a news conference following their meeting with the
President on Monday, the bishops' spokesman said that during the
meeting the bishops hardly had time to elaborate on many of their
comments because ``the President dominated much of the
conversation''.
	   The President's manners are lamentable because put together with
his other incomprehensible styles it is not hard for us to envisage
that he will lead this nation to a standstill in this fast changing
world.
	   It is noteworthy that Habibie's style can be portrayed in the
awkward selection of his ``reform'' cabinet, in which many of the
members represent stubborn antireform elements of the old
administration, and in his refusal to say bluntly that his
government is transitional in nature. This all shows that he is not
in the least sensitive to the people's aspirations. Perhaps, it is
the characteristic of a leader who has both feet firmly planted in
the air.
	   Viewing the fact that Habibie was a steadfast part of the
Soeharto administration, that there are so many legal experts still
questioning the legality of his appointment, that students are
still demanding his immediate departure and that he may well be
prompted to lead a national effort to regain any money Soeharto and
his cronies may have illegally accrued during the New Order regime,
we just cannot understand why Habibie continues with his insipid
and weak management.
	   We are afraid that his refusal to change his tune might inspire
his ministers to follow his example, which would lead to a
rejection of openness and a return to the old tradition of
fabricated truths.

German unemployment rate down in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ More Germans were employed in May than
at any point in the past two years, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said Friday.
	   Between April and May, 220,000 people found jobs, bringing the
number of unemployed to 4.2 million, or 10.9 percent, Kohl told a
group in Essen. It is the first time since 1996 that Germany's
number of unemployed has dropped below 11 percent, down from 11.4
percent in April.
	   Kohl said the main goal of German interior politics is ``to give
people who want to work the chance to work.''
	   The chancellor said his government would continue trying to
create new jobs, but a reform of the tax system was still necessary
after the elections.
	   Last month, thousands of unemployed took to the streets in
Germany's major cities to protest the nationwide lack of jobs.
	   While Kohl revealed the drop in joblessness early, official
unemployment figures from the federal labor office are not expected
until next week.

	   JAKARTA (JP): At least two youngsters were severely injured in
two separate clashes between Betawi (native Jakartan) residents of
Kebon Melati and occupants of the Mess Cendrawasih boarding house
from Irian Jaya in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, yesterday
afternoon.
	   The first clash began at 4.30 p.m. after Farid, a 19-year-old
Betawi resident, was attacked by an unidentified youth who lives in
the boarding house.
	   ``Farid was parking his motorbike near Jl. Mess (now called Jl.
Pala 5) when he was attacked. His back was badly lacerated when he
was struck with a machete.
	   ``Luckily he managed to escape and reported the incident to
local residents,'' Abdul Mutalib, 48, said.
	   The motive for the attack was not clear, but Abdul said that
Betawi and Irianese residents in the area had been involved in an
often bitter feud for a long time.
	   Jl. Mess is opposite Jl. Kebon Melati III where the boarding
house is located.
	   Shortly after news of the attack on Farid spread through the
Kebon Melati area, Betawi (native Jakartan) residents in the area,
including teenagers and housewives, thronged to the boarding house
armed with knives and pans and began to throw stones at it.
	   While the clash was still going on, another brawl involving
youths erupted on the nearby soccer field.
	   Raqif, 19, a Betawi youth, was rushed to Mintohardjo Hospital
after being stabbed in the chest with an arrow by an Irianese
teenager.
	   Chaidir Rohamsyah, 40, said the incident started when a group of
Irianese youths walked onto the field and grabbed the Betawi
youth's football.
	   The second incident inflamed the anger of the crowd outside the
Cendrawasih boarding house and they began to rain bricks and other
missiles down on the boarding house.
	   Nearby Jl. K.H. Mas Mansyur resembled a war zone after Irianese
residents in the area retaliated.
	   ``It was truly chaos,'' Chaidir said.
	   Two hundred police officers and 300 military personnel were
dispatched to the scene to stop the fighting, but were greeted with
stones thrown by Betawi residents.
	   The crowd finally dispersed peacefully at 6.30 p.m.
	   None of the Irianese youths involved in the incidents were
available for comment yesterday.
	   Part of Jl. K.H. Mas Mansyur was temporarily closed by security
officers during the clash.
	   Central Jakarta Police chief Lt. Col. Iman Haryatna said at the
scene: ``These people are desperate to fight. I do not understand
how small incidents can escalate into serious clashes like this.''
	   Both groups of residents promised never to fight again after a
similar brawl about a month ago, recalled Iman, shaking his head.
	   Iman told reporters that the police were getting tired of the
long-running feud between the two groups in the area and he
promised to bring those responsible to justice.
	   No arrests had been made by late yesterday evening and police
were still conducting enquiries.
	   ``We'll summon representatives of both groups,'' Iman said.
	   Central Jakarta Mayor Andi Subur Abdullah once said that the
mayoralty had discussed the status of the boarding house with the
Irian Jaya provincial administration. Irian Jaya authorities are
partly responsible for the Cendrawasih boarding house which is home
to 300 people from the country's easternmost province.
	   No final decision has been taken on by the mayoralty on the
status of the troubled boarding house.
	   Iman said that yesterday's clash took the number of violent
incidents in the area to 15 this year. (edt)

	   SING TAO chairman Sally Aw Sian is not selling her interest in
the company to Mingly Corp but is still in talks with third parties
for the sale of part or all of her stake.
	   ``The parties have failed to reach an agreement and decided on 3
June, 1998 not to proceed with further discussions,'' the two
companies announced yesterday.
	   Miss Aw and Mingly had been in discussions to revise an earlier
conditional agreement.
	   That preliminary deal would have led to the creation of a new
company jointly owned by Mingly and Miss Aw to purchase her shares
in Sing Tao.
	   It would also have led to the new company making a mandatory
cash offer of $1.76 per share for the remaining Sing Tao shares.
	   Sing Tao said it has been informed by Miss Aw that discussions
are continuing with independent third parties concerning the
possible purchase of all or part of Miss Aw's stake.
	   ``The discussions are in preliminary stage. If appropriate, a
further announcement will be made in due course,'' said Sing Tao
company secretary Seaman Kwok Siu-man.
	   Sing Tao and its 43 per cent-controlled Culturecom Holding have
applied to the stock exchange to resume trading in their shares
today.
	   Trading in both shares was suspended on 27 May.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The city administration has been forced to suspend
a number of major development projects included in the 1998/1999
budget because of the prolonged monetary crisis, Governor Sutiyoso
said.
	   Sutiyoso said on Wednesday that among the suspended projects
were the controversial three-tier transit system, the Manggarai
integrated bus terminal and the Jakarta Bay land reclamation
project.
	   ``I don't think that any physical development projects will take
place this year given our current financial condition,'' Sutiyoso
said without giving further details.
	   Head of City Council Commission D for development Ali Wongso
Sinaga welcomed Sutiyoso's decision to suspend the projects.
	   ``These projects have all but been postponed by developers
already,'' he said yesterday.
	   Ali also urged the administration to make private companies
involved in the land reclamation project to declare whether or not
they were able to continue with the work.
	   ``One or two companies have started reclamation work but their
progress has been very slow,'' he said.
	   Ali said it was better if the administration identified other
more capable investors, including foreign firms if necessary, and
asked them to submit a new tender for the project.
	   ``The administration should judge companies by their practical
achievements, not by what they have written on paper,'' he said.
	   Ali also demanded that the administration revoke concessions
awarded to companies on the strength of their political
connections.
	   ``An open tender for the project should be carried out in the
near future. The current concession holders would all be welcome to
meet their competition on a level playing field and prove their
worth,'' he said.
	   Companies which have begun work should be suitably compensated
after their achievements have been evaluated by the administration,
he added.
	   The administration has to date signed seven Memorandums of
Understanding and three development agreements with private
companies regarding the reclamation project.
	   Among companies with an involvement in the project are PT Kapuk
Naga Indah, a Salim Group subsidiary which holds a concession to
reclaim 674 hectares of land; PT Pembangunan Jaya Ancol, a joint
venture between the city administration and property tycoon Ciputra
which holds a 392 hectare concession; PT Manggala Krida Yudha, a
company partly owned by former President Soeharto's youngest
daughter Siti Hutami Endang Adiningsih, which holds a 375 hectare
concession; and PT Jaladri Kartika Eka Paksi, a company associated
with the Armed Forces which holds rights to 200 hectares of land.
	   The company owned by Hutami was the first to win a concession on
the reclamation project. Her company signed an MOU with the
administration in August 1996.
	   The other companies joined later after the city administration
extended invitations to them through the Pantura Reclamation Board.
	   The board was established following Presidential Decree No.
52/1995 which granted the board authority to develop the plan and
issue all project permits.
	   The project aims to transform the northern coastal area into a
future waterfront city by reclaiming 2,700 hectares of inundated
land and revitalizing 13,709 hectares of land along the north
coast. (cst)

World Cup: English F.A. switches and backs Blatter
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS 6th graf to show Blatter believes he's favorite  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Football Association, after early
support for Lennart Johansson for the FIFA presidency, came out
Friday behind his rival Sepp Blatter.
	   On Monday, the FIFA Congress meeting in Paris will vote on a new
president to succeed Brazilian Joao Havelange.
	   ``After careful deliberation... England will cast its vote in
favor of Sepp Blatter,'' the F.A. said in a brief statement.
	   The English F.A. had initially backed Johansson, president of
Europe's governing body of soccer UEFA, when he was the lone
candidate. Blatter, the FIFA general secretary, declared his
candidacy only a few months ago.
	   Neither candidate has backed England's bid to land the 2006
World Cup.
	   Blatter, who believes he is the favorite to win Monday's vote,
said earlier this week he wants Africa to host the 2006 World Cup.
Johansson has favored Germany over England to be the European
bidder for 2006.
	   As recently as January, F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly said
he supported Johansson.
	   ``Lennart Johansson has always been a friend to England and at
this stage we are maintaining our support for him,'' Kelly said in
Ghent, Belgium.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Customs officers at Soekarno-Hatta International
Airport have arrested a 30-year-old Togolese for allegedly
smuggling 8.6 kilograms of first-grade opium alkaloid into the
country inside a 21-inch television set, an official said
yesterday.
	   Head of the custom and excise services unit Conny Sunanto said
Wednesday that the suspect, identified only as KIS, was detained
upon his arrival on Thai Airways flight TG-413 from Bangkok on
Saturday afternoon.
	   The heroin, which has a street value of Rp 10 billion
(US$100,000), is the largest shipment intercepted by the
authorities this year.
	   According to Sunanto, customs officers were not at first
suspicious of KIS until their specially-trained sniffer dogs
approached the man and began to bark furiously.
	   They took him aside for questioning and then later detained him.
	   ``The suspect was unable to turn the television set on when
asked to during questioning,'' he added.
	   The officers later found the narcotics carefully wrapped in
plastic bags and strapped inside the television set, he said.
	   During interrogation the suspect admitted that he had thought
security at the airport was lax and that he would be able to enter
the country unchallenged.
	   The suspect has been handed over to the National Police, who
have now taken responsibility for the case, Sunanto said.
	   Three drug smugglers have been arrested at the airport this
month. On May 9 a Liberian and a Gambian were caught attempting to
bring 765 grams of heroin into the country, Sunanto said. The
heroin was packed into 55 capsules, he added.
	   The two also arrived in Indonesia from Bangkok, he said.
	   ``The drugs had been hidden in a number of different places,
such as in their shorts, wallets and sandals,'' he explained.
	   Last year, customs officers at the airport seized 63,481 Ecstasy
pills, 4.1 kilograms of shabu-shabu (an amphetamine derivative),
5.8 kg of heroin and 3 kg of hashish. (41/edt)

	   THE government has learned valuable lessons from the
liberalisation of various telecommunications market sectors in Hong
Kong, said Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, K
C Kwong.
	   He said these lessons showed that competition will stimulate the
market, increase efficiency and widen choice resulting in price
reductions.
	   In a speech yesterday before the third Apec Ministerial Meeting
on the Telecommunications and Information Industry in Singapore
yesterday, he said the benefits of liberalised competition have
been demonstrated in the mobile telecommunications sector.
	   It has also spurred innovation among the manufacturing companies
around the world which supply Hong Kong.
	   ``A case in point is access to mobile telecommunications on our
underground railway where customers can make and receive mobile
calls on all five cellular systems across different networks, and
eventually on all 11 cellular and personal communication services
networks.
	   ``These innovative applications are equally usable in other
places,'' he said.
	   Turning to the local fixed telecommunications sector which was
liberalised in 1995, Mr Kwong said the government awarded three new
licences for the networks. There are now four companies providing
local phone facilities and basic telephonic service, which include
international call access, on a facilities basis in Hong Kong.
	   ``The operators have all met their roll-out commitments and have
completed their trunk network.
	   Increasingly buildings are being wired up to the new networks
and customers are offered choices in the supply of
telecommunications services,'' Mr Kwong said. There will also be
phased liberalisation of the external telecommunications market.
Competition will be introduced to external services in January 1999
and facilities in January 2000.

Opposition leader resigns in bribery attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ In an attempt at damage control, a
freshly resigned leader of Slovakia's main group of opposition
parties on Friday said he was assuming resposibility for a bribery
affair tainting the coalition.
	   Jozef Paczelt spoke to reporters a day after stepping down as
election manager for the Slovak Democratic Coalition, which is
reeling under accusations of involvement in trying to bribe
journalists in exchange for favorable reporting.
	   Nobody in the party has been directly implicated, and even if
the attempted bribery occurred it is unclear whether it was on the
initiative of an advertising agency handling the coalition's
election campaign.
	   Still, the scandal has hurt the opposition grouping, whose main
asset going into September elections has been the aura of
corruption surrounding the government of authoritarian Premier
Vladmir Meciar.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  Ed: UPDATES with new deaths reported, other details. PICKS UP 6th
graf pvs: Ethnic Albanians form ...
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ More than 50 Kosovo Albanians have
been killed and about 200 are missing since Serbian government
forces started an offensive in the independence-minded province a
week ago, an ethnic Albanian leader said Friday.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so Kosovo Albanians who trekked into neighboring Albania
overnight reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people, said
to have died of exhaustion, and three small children. About 10,000
refugees have gathered around Tropoja in northern Albania.
	   In the reported government offensive in Kosovo, four villages
populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed, and another eight
badly damaged, said Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic
League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main party.
	   Sixteen other villages are deserted as residents fled, Cacaj
added.
	   He listed more than 50 dead and some 200 missing from the latest
offensive, concentrated around Decani, some 70 kilometers (45
miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Separately, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian
leaders in the province, said one Albanian was killed and two
wounded in fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina. It said Serb shelling continued in the
Decani area and around the town of Djakovica in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an Albanian woman wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Head of Golkar's Jakarta chapter Tadjus Sobirin
yesterday responded harshly to criticism by several city councilors
over Governor Sutiyoso's plans to remove collusion, corruption and
nepotism from the city administration.
	   Tadjus said the councilors' criticisms were just political
maneuvering.
	   ``It was just a political ploy. What are their goals? Of course,
to undermine the governor,'' he said.
	   ``They are also devising plans to prepare for the future
election,'' said Tadjus without elaboration.
	   Several councilors, including head of the United Development
Party (PPP) faction Achmad Suaidy, PPP faction member Saud Rahman
and head of the Indonesian Democratic Party faction Lukman F.
Mokoginta, said Wednesday that it was Sutiyoso himself who needed
to be introspective if collusion and nepotism were to be wiped away
from his office.
	   They said Sutiyoso's governorship was achieved through collusion
and admitted that they were forced by the City Council speaker to
vote for him.
	   Tadjus questioned why the councilors did not refuse to obey the
instruction to vote for Sutiyoso from the beginning.
	   ``If they were really against it, then why didn't they say it in
the first place. Why do they have to bring up such things now since
they happened in the past,'' he said.
	   Sutiyoso would have certainly become the governor even if there
was no pressure on the councilors to vote for him, Tadjus said.
``Remember, it is the president's prerogative to choose his
governor,'' he added.
	   He said people must look into each case carefully before
labeling it as being influenced by collusive, corrupt or nepotistic
practices.
	   Tadjus further argued that not all collusive and nepotistic
practices were wrong.
	   ``For example, collusion in which officials let street vendors
freely operate in certain areas without paying levies is OK because
it helps the latter to survive in their daily lives.
	   ``It is also fine for a high profile person's child, who is
capable and professional in what he or she is doing, to get a
certain position. Employers would respect the parents' name but
would give the job to the child because of ability. See, nepotism
is not always wrong,'' he added.
	   Sutiyoso himself looked calm when responding to reporters'
questions on the councilors' criticisms against him.
	   ``Many people now like to condemn senior officials. How will we
be able to peacefully work if they keep trashing us? If (the
accusation) is proven to be correct, it's fine. But, if it is just
slander, then it would only be counterproductive,'' he said.
	   Sutiyoso, however, refused to directly comment on the
councilors' allegations.
	   ``In my heart, I'm just laughing to death,'' said the governor
with a cynical look on his face. (cst)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Three people were injured and Rp 34 million in
cash stolen in separate armed robberies on Monday and Tuesday,
police said.
	   Jakarta Police spokesman Lt. Col. E. Aritonang said one of the
incidents took place on Tuesday in Cipinang Muara, East Jakarta.
	   The victims, Mahadi Hamid, 53, and Sugiyo, 40, were getting out
of a President Taxi after withdrawing Rp 34 million from a nearby
bank to pay the salaries of their high school employees, he said.
	   ``Two unidentified men on a motorbike attacked them, wounding
Mahadi's right hand and striking Sugiyo on the head, before making
off with the money,'' Aritonang said.
	   The other robbery occurred on Monday on Jl. Sumbawa, Menteng,
Central Jakarta, he said.
	   Police arrested the alleged robber, identified as Agus Setiawan,
22, after he was beaten by an angry mob at the scene of the crime.
	   ``He hailed an Express Taxi and attempted to rob the driver,
Karto Mulyono, 65, after stabbing him three times with a bayonet,''
Aritonang said.
	   Aritonang added that a third robbery, in which a con man
relieved a victim of Rp 5 million after first hypnotizing her, took
place on Tuesday.
	   The victim, identified as Patriyani, 32, was put into a trance
by a dandy man as she waited for a taxi at a bus stop on Jl. Gajah
Mada, West Jakarta. (edt)

	   THE recent uncertainty in the property and financial markets as
well as the increase in unemployment, has prompted investors to
consider entering a franchise business.
	   The Hong Kong Franchise Association (HKFA) said it has noticed a
surge in interest in franchising, not just within the SAR, but also
relating to the mainland.
	   The association's president Pang Yiu-Kai said the increase in
the number of inquiries about the franchise industry in the past
two months reflected the public's interest in setting up businesses
in the current downturn and period of high unemployment.
	   Retail analysts, however, warned that during periods of tight
money supply it is not easy to get bank loans to set up businesses.
	   Purchasing power, they said, still remained poor and it was hard
to sustain newly established retail businesses _ except those
involved with some low-end products.
	   Mr Pang said the amount of investment in obtaining franchising
rights can range from several hundred thousand dollars to a couple
of million, and it depends on the nature of the individual
business.
	   The success rate of making a profit is around 70 to 80 per cent
which is higher than the non-franchising business sector, with less
risk.
	   The returns period can be as short as one year or as long as
four years during normal economic times.
	   It could, however, be longer given the poor environment, he
said.
	   The average range of profit margin is around 10 to 15 per cent,
but it is possible that the figure will be lower during periods of
economic downturn where the market consumption power is low, he
said.

	   GOVERNMENTS must regulate or impose restrictions on the
practices of their currency traders to end the current economic
woes and currency instability, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.
	   The Prime Minister said as long as the philosophy of the world
was to accept the unbridled activities of these traders in the name
of free trade, ``then we are going to have economic turmoil and
currency instability forever''.
	   Dr Mahathir was replying to a question about the regional
currency problem during a question-and-answer session at the fourth
international conference on ``Future of Asia'' hosted by Nihon
Keizai Shimbun Inc (Nikkei) at Okura hotel yesterday.
	   He had earlier delivered his keynote address, ``The future of
Asia in a globalised and deregulated world''.
	   He said currency traders cannot regulate themselves and even if
they were operating offshore there were ways to regulate them.
	   ``Everybody lives in some country or other and is subject to
some law or other. If the countries in which these people operate
agree to restrict or regulate their actions I am quite sure we can
overcome the problem.''
	   Dr Mahathir said the question that must be asked was whether the
world wanted ``such volatility'' (in the financial market) that it
could render the currency of a prosperous country unstable.
	   ``I don't think so. If you think that that is not good then you
have to do something to restore the situation or make it better.''
	   On another question on whether there was a difference between
new capitalists in the United States, Europe or Asia, Dr Mahathir
replied that although he believed there was none, what would happen
was that no matter where they were, they would coalesce in order to
grow bigger.
	   When they became huge, that in itself would have its own impetus
and momentum which cannot be stopped.
	   ``When they get big they can influence governments and can
actually push aside small governments. There will be no democracy
in the world. Just like the banana republics in the past, companies
are so powerful in a country that politics will have to bow to the
wishes of the companies. I hope and pray this will not happen.''
	   On whether there was a possibility of the emergence of a common
Asian currency in the wake of the currency problem in the region,
Dr Mahathir said at some stage there would probably be but like in
Europe it would not be easily implemented and would take a long
time before there could be one single Asian currency.
	   But he said there were other ways, without having to resort to
having a common currency.
	   On whether there was a possibility of a whole new round of
problems being triggered in view of the huge market in the auto and
steel production and manufacturing in Southeast Asia, Dr Mahathir
said that while he believed there would be, the proportion would
not be bad.
	   He believed that it was better to have many small companies than
a few giant companies.
	   Dr Mahathir said when a giant company collapsed, it could affect
a country and the world.
	   ``We have seen a lot of companies going bankrupt in Malaysia
without making the country go bankrupt. If, for example a bank with
US$600 billion capital collapses, everybody makes a run on the
bank, no safety net in the world can save the bank and it will fall
right through.''
	   On whether the change in government in Indonesia had positive or
negative effects on the region, Dr Mahathir said a mere change of
government could not correct all the weaknesses of a country if
this change was not accompanied by other factors.

Holyfield fights who's there
</HEADLINE>
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield doesn't see the likes of a
Henry Akinwande or a Vaughn Bean when he looks at the heavyweight
division.
	   Contenders are viewed simply as nuisances to be disposed of as
he seeks his place in heavyweight history.
	   In their place, Holyfield sees Lennox Lewis and a chance to
unify the title. He sees Mike Tyson and a possible third megafight.
And he looks into the past to compare his record to that of
Muhammad Ali, as a champion who fought them all.
	   Still, business must be taken care of. And Saturday night,
Holyfield finds himself with a bit of work to do against Akinwande
before he can continue his improbable late charge into heavyweight
greatness.
	   In a fight almost no one besides Akinwande and the WBA wants,
Holyfield defends the title he won from Tyson in a bout against a
fighter best known for an embarrassing performance in his first
title fight 11 months ago.
	   ``There's no other reason for this fight other than he's ranked
No. 1,'' Holyfield said. ``That's just what the rules are.''
	   Holyfield, coming off two huge wins over Tyson and a revenge win
over Michael Moorer, has a lot on his mind as he maps out what he
figures will be the final two years of what has been a remarkable
pro career.
	   His plan to unify the title before retiring, and thoughts of his
place in history, have seemed just as important to Holyfield as the
6-foot-7 (2.01-meter) fighter he will met in a defense mandated by
the WBA.
	   ``It's a goal of mine to retire as the current undisputed
champion,'' Holyfield said. ``I want to retire that way, relinquish
my belt because I'm tired of doing it.''
	   Holyfield has seemed almost bored during the week leading into
the fight, for which he is being paid dlrs 10 million. Though
always in shape, he weighed 218 1/2 pounds (99.11 kilos) for the
fight, up from 214 pounds (97.07 kilos) for his November bout
against Moorer that gave him the IBF title in addition to the WBA
crown.
	   It might be expected that Holyfield would suffer a letdown
fighting Akinwande, a fighter most renowned for holding Lewis so
much that he was disqualified during their WBC title fight last
July.
	   Not so, says Holyfield, who claims to have more respect for
Akinwande's talents than most boxing observers.
	   ``I tend to bring out the best in other fighters,'' he said.
``I'm preparing for him to be the best he can be. I just don't know
what that is.''
	   Holyfield defends the WBA portion of the title in a scheduled
12-round fight that tops a card at Madison Square Garden. Also is
46-year-old Roberto Duran's challenge for the WBA middleweight
title against William Joppy.
	   The main event begins about 1430 GMT.
	   Holyfield finds himself fighting Akinwande (33-1-1, 19
knockouts) only because talks with Lewis over a unification of all
three belts broke down in disputes over money and television
contracts.
	   He'll give away five inches (13 cms) in height, four inches (10
cms) in reach and some pounds (kilos) to the top-ranked challenger,
who weighed in at 240 1/4 pounds (108.98 kilos) on Thursday. But
Akinwande carries the burden of his performance against Lewis, and
still must prove that be belongs among the top heavyweights.
	   ``People wonder if I can get up for this fight,'' Holyfield
said. ``I'm up for every fight.''
	   Holyfield prepared for the fight in his early training sessions
by having sparring partner James ``Big House'' Gaines, a 6-foot-6
(1.98-meter), 310-pounder (140.62-kilo man) hold on to him like
Akinwande clutched Lewis.
	   But Akinwande vows to fight aggressively in his second title
fight in less than a year. If he doesn't, even ties to promoter Don
King will make it unlikely that he'll get another shot.
	   ``I don't have to be careful about nothing,'' Akinwande said.
``I'm going to come out and make my own fight.''
	   On the undercard, the seemingly ageless Duran fights for a title
nine years after he lost his middleweight crown to Sugar Ray
Leonard. Duran first fought in the Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in
his career at the arena.
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a
decision in Panama in his last fight after being knocked down in
the first round.
	   ``You're going to be certain to see a very different Roberto
Duran than you've seen lately,'' Duran said. ``You're going to be
surprised.''
	   Also fighting on the card were super bantamweight champion
Johnny Tapia and female fighter Christy Martin, whose first
opponent was scratched when a pre-fight physical showed she was
pregnant.

	   DATUK Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad yesterday painted a bleak picture
of Asia's future in a globalised and deregulated world, in which
Asian countries will prosper but their economies will be dominated
and run by ``new capitalists''.
	   The Prime Minister said in such a world the future of Asia would
be so closely intertwined and interlinked with that of the rest of
the world that it could not be distinguished from the world's
future.
	   ``Asian countries will prosper but not as Asian countries. Their
economies would be dominated and run by huge foreign corporations,
practically all owned and managed by non-Asians,'' he said in his
keynote address at the Nihon Keizei Shimbun Inc (Nikkei) The Future
of Asia international conference at Okura Hotel here.
	   This is the second time Dr Mahathir has been invited to address
the conference. The first was in 1995.
	   Dr Mahathir said in a future where Asia could remain intact
after extricating itself from the present situation, there could
indeed be a restoration of the healthy competition among Asia,
Europe and the US.
	   ``But the new capitalists would not want to miss the opportunity
to dominate the world and make lots of money in the process.
	   ``Only if their own countries restrain them will the future of
the world, of which Asia is a part, be peaceful and prosperous.''
	   The Prime Minister, who spoke on The Future of Asia in a
Globalised and Deregulated World, traced the history and
development of the economic systems of the world after the Second
World War and their impact on the less developed nations.
	   Dr Mahathir, in his prediction, sees Southeast Asia providing a
base for the production of low-cost products to compete with those
of certain large Asian economies which refuse to be controlled.
	   ``In the end these countries, too, will give in,'' he said,
adding that the Governments would submit because ``they know they
are up against forces they cannot defeat''.
	   Dr Mahathir said in such a situation, the people would ``show
their resentment against those outsiders who will lord it over them
once again''.
	   ``Sooner rather than later they will think of regaining control
over their economies. They will regard this as a new war of
liberation. Even if they want to avoid violence, violence must come
as the new capitalists disregard the signs.''
	   In a speech that also reflected his contempt for currency
traders for causing the financial problem in the region, Dr
Mahathir said in the push for deregulation and globalisation, it
was not the exploitation of local labour that was the focus of the
new capitalists, but ``the exploitation of the poor countries
worldwide that promises unlimited gains''.
	   ``These capitalists do not talk of millions of dollars of
profits, they talk of billions of dollars. They cannot wait to do
ordinary businesses involving time-consuming research,
manufacturing and exporting.
	   ``They want to make their billions overnight. And currency
trading provides them with mind-boggling profits.''
	   Dr Mahathir said these capitalists had become a force no
Government of developing countries could go against simply because
they had ``trillions at their disposal''.
	   It was not difficult for them to promote ``the legitimacy and
the wholesomeness'' of their concept of the new world order because
they had control of the media that helped them to shape public
opinion and censor criticisms.
	   ``If they say globalism is good, then the whole apparatus will
say so and no one will be allowed to say otherwise.''

	   THE listing division of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK)
may take further action against C P Pokphand over the belated
disclosure of loan transactions involving firms associated with its
directors.
	   The SEHK has already reserved the right to take ``appropriate''
action against the company.
	   The agricultural products trader _ one of the largest foreign
companies doing business on the mainland _ has failed to disclose a
loan worth $129.3 million to two companies associated with two of
its directors, Dhanin Chearavanont and Sumet Jiaravanon.
	   C P Pokphand advanced the loan to the companies through three
subsidiaries on the mainland.
	   While the loans were repaid between 17 April and 18 May this
year, the company said it realised it had violated the Hong Kong
listing rules by not announcing the loans when they were made at
the time.
	   A SEHK spokesman said they would not investigate the case but
rely on the information submitted by the company. ``We'll present
the case to the listing committee and they decide whether or not
further action will be taken according to the rules,'' he said.
	   The loan deal was discovered by auditors Ernst  Young, as it
was reviewing the company's accounts.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A customer of South East Asian Bank (SEAB), which
was liquidated last November, has complained about the difficulty
in recovering a large part of her savings from the bank.
	   The customer, Indrawati Halim, said she had only received some
Rp 30 million of the Rp 100 million in the account, suspecting that
the remainder had been embezzled by irresponsible bank employees.
	   ``I don't know where else I can turn too. I keep going to SEAB,
trying to collect my money, but those bankers are already gone,''
she said.
	   Indrawati said she became a customer of SEAB in February 1995,
and that two of the bank's employees, Sien Cu and Lili, had
convinced her to keep all of her money there.
	   ``At first everything went well. I admitted that I didn't know
anything about banking, and so these two people guided me and
persuaded me to put Rp 100 million in SEAB,'' she said.
	   SEAB was liquidated last November. The two bankers disappeared
and Indrawati became worried about her money.
	   ``I'm going crazy. I still haven't received the rest of the
money,'' she said on Monday.
	   The case was reported to the city police for further
investigation last month. (edt)

Peres edges close to acknowledging Israel's nuclear capability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Edging close to acknowledging that Israel is a
nuclear power, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Friday that
the Jewish state pursued a nuclear option to prevent war.
	   Israel has never acknowledged that it has nuclear weapons,
saying only it would not be the first to use them in the region.
Western intelligence reports say the country is the only nuclear
power in the Mideast and has a significant stockpile.
	   Peres was the main force behind the establishment of Israel's
nuclear reactor in the southern Negev Desert town of Dimona in the
1950s. At the time, he was director general of the Defense Ministry
and a confidant of then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.
	   Asked by Israel TV's Channel Two why Dimona was built, Peres
said he hoped at the time it would help Israel negotiate peace
agreements with its Arab neighbors.
	   ``Even then, I think we had Oslo in mind, and not Hiroshima,''
Peres said, referring to the interim peace agreements with the
Palestinians his government signed between 1993 and 1995.
	   ``No one made a bomb to use it. Instead, we wanted a veiled
nuclear option in order to prevent war,'' Peres said.
	   Excerpts of the interview were broadcast Friday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The MCA International Affairs Bureau
today urged Malaysians studying or working in Japan to register
with the Malaysian embassy there.
	   Its chairman, Datuk Chor Chee Heung, said this was to enable
embassy officials to assist Malaysians during emergency situations.
	   He said that registering with the embassy would help in cases of
Malaysians reported missing in Japan.
	   However, Chor, who is also Transport Ministry Parliamentary
Secretary, said that most cases of Malaysians reported missing in
Japan - which had been brought to the attention of MCA Public
Services and Complaints Department - had been solved.
	   ``This is due to the good relations enjoyed by the department
with the Japanese police,'' he said.
	   Chor was speaking to reporters following a courtesy call from
visiting Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's International
Criminal Investigation Division chief, Inspector Eiji Miyamoto, at
Wisma MCA.
	   He said the department had received reports of seven missing
Malaysians believed to be in Japan. They are: Waitress Ng Poh Choo,
22, of Raub, Pahang. She has been missing since March.
	   Chong Yin Fah, 44, of Pusing in Perak, who has been missing
since December, 1996.

	   Chor said the department had received many reports of Malaysians
missing in Japan over the past few years. However, with the
exception of eight cases, the rest had been solved.
	   Miyamoto said crime involving Malaysians in Japan was one of the
lowest, as compared to those of other nationalities. However, he
could not provide any statistics.
	   According to unofficial statistics provided by the Japanese
embassy in Malaysia, more than 10,000 Malaysians are believed to
have overstayed in Japan this year.
	   This, however, constitutes a decrease in the number as compared
to 1992, when there were an estimated 42,000 Malaysians who were
found to have overstayed there.

	   TANGERANG (JP): About 54 hectares of paddy fields, which were
ready for harvest, in Tiga Raksa and Cisoka districts, were
inundated Wednesday after the nearby Cipayaeun and Manceri rivers
burst their banks.
	   Besides destroying the paddy fields, the flooding also ruined 12
hectares of secondary crops, ranging from vegetables to peanuts,
according to Antara.
	   Sumarna Ady, the head of the disaster prevention center in Tiga
Raksa, said Wednesday's flooding was the deepest in the last 10
years.
	   ``The paddy was scheduled to be harvested next week,'' he said,
adding that if the floodwaters do not subside in the next seven
days, the crops will be lost.
	   The flood, which reached 1.5 meters in height, also inundated 45
houses in the Matagara and Mindi subdistricts in Tiga Raksa. (hhr)

	   THE government's recent offensive against infringers of
intellectual property rights has started to produce results.
	   But the government will not be taking any chances and will
further tighten the copyright ordinance in the event of a worsening
of the problem, Director of Intellctual Property Stephen Selby said
yesterday.
	   He said the government will not rule out the possibility of
further boosting current regulations if there is a renewed upsurge
in the piracy of copyrighted products.
	   Strengthened regulations could include empowering the Customs
and Excise Department to close down premises selling pirated
products.
	   ``At present, there are no concrete proposals to bring in new
amendments,'' he said.
	   Mr Selby said measures to combat copyright piracy have now
become more effective with the introduction of new measures late
last March.
	   The new measures require compact disc manufacturers in Hong Kong
to get a licence from the government before they can start their
production.
	   He said more than 20 million pirated compact discs have been
seized by customs officers recently.
	   Mr Selby said it looked unlikely the government would make it a
criminal offence for members of the public to buy pirated software
because doing so would require many factors to be taken into
account apart from various difficulties that would have to be
thrashed out.
	   Mr Selby said there might be a need to establish cross-reference
links across copyright management databases to enable law enforcers
worldwide and international users of a copyright work to identify
the owner of the copyright and to assist law enforcement.

	   KUANTAN, Thurs. - Some schools in the State are having to find
alternative sources of income to pay their utility bills as the
Other Cost Annual Recurrent grant provided by the Education
Ministry is not enough.
	   State Education and Religious Affairs Committee chairman Datuk
Adnan Yaakob said the schools were receiving between RM17,000 and
RM20,000 per year from the ministry.
	   Adnan said for some schools, the money was not sufficient and
therefore, they had to organise fund-raising activities to
supplement the ministry's grant.
	   He said there were even schools which had requested money from
the State Government.
	   Adnan was asked about the findings of an investigation carried
out by the State Education Department into a recent move by Sekolah
Menengah Abdul Rahman Talib's Parent-Teacher Association to
organise special canteen day to help the school pay its RM22,000
electricity bill arrears.
	   Following complaints by parents, the PTA called off the event
which was to have been held on May 23.
	   Adnan said Sekolah Menengah Abdul Rahman Talib was one of the
premier schools in the State.
	   ``Facilities in the school, including the hall, are fully
utilised even at night as teachers and students strive to maintain
the school's excellent academic record,'' he said.
	   He said the monthly electricity bills of the school came to
about RM2,000 and the RM22,000 was accumulated over the years. ``As
far as the State Government is concerned, we are satisfied with the
explanation,'' he said.
	   Adnan said there were many other schools in the State which
organised special canteen days to raise funds but parents were not
complaining.

Filly trying to make English Derby history

<TEXT>
	   EPSOM, England (AP) _ Cape Verdi will make English Derby history
just by racing at Epsom Saturday. But winning England's most famous
flat race _ boasting the best field in a decade _ would nudge her
into a class of her own.
	   The 1,000 Guineas winner is striving to become the first filly
to win the Derby since 1916. But even if she fails, her place in
history is already secured.
	   For the first time since 1917, the winners of the two Newmarket
classics _ the 1,000 Guineas and the 2,000 Guineas _ will go
head-to-head in the Derby, with Cape Verdi and 2.000 Guineas winner
King of Kings both in the field of 15.
	   Cape Verdi, entered late by the Godolphin syndicate at a cost of
75,000 pounds (dlrs 122,250) last Saturday, will join an elite
group of females in racing if she wins.
	   Only six fillies have won the English Derby in its 218-year
history, the last being Fifinella in 1916.
	   In 1912, Tagalia set a record as the only filly to have won the
1,000 Guineas prior to winning the Derby, a feat Cape Verdi is
trying to match.
	   While Cape Verdi is a sentimental favorite, bookmakers have
listed Greek Dance as the favorite.
	   British bookmakers Coral said a flood of money bet on Greek
Dance Friday saw the odds shorten on Michael Stoute's runner from
7-2 to 3-1.
	   Clare said he was expecting the British public to bet 40 million
pounds (dlrs 65.2 million) on the Derby this year, eclipsing all
previous betting records for the Epsom classic.
	   ``This is the finest collection of thoroughbreds to grace the
Epsom turf in over a decade and, as a result, we are expecting the
betting public to stake more money than ever before,'' he said.
	   Clare said betting on early favorite Second Empire had slowed
down and the odds had lengthened from 3-1 to 4-1. Cape Verdi was
listed at 7-2 Friday.
	   This is Greek Dance's first big race, a disadvantage against a
more experienced field. Greek Dance has been brought along slowly
by trainer Michael Stoute and after and the colt remains relatively
unexposed.
	   He ran only once as a juvenile, showing promise finishing a
six-length second to Tamarisk over seven furlongs last September.
	   He did not race again until April when he won a 10-furlong
maiden at Newmarket, starting as 6-4 favorite in a field of 18.
	   He also won his last race, competing in better company in the
Glasgow Stakes over an extended mile and a quarter at York.

US human rights lawyers urge Turkey to punish police torturers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey must seriously punish police who
torture to put an end to the practice, a group of legal experts
from the United States said Friday.
	   The 11-member mission, including students of Fordham Law school
and members of the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, has been on a fact-finding mission in Turkey for two weeks
looking at the country's compliance with international human rights
standards.
	   Turkey is often criticized for widespread human rights
violations, including police torture.
	   Neil Hicks, senior program coordinator at the Lawyers Committee,
said in an interview that the ``culture of roughing up detainees is
still strong among security forces.''
	   Although more police are being prosecuted, the cases don't seem
to be getting serious treatment in the courts, he said.
	   Identifying torturers is also a problem. Police often make no
record of who questions a suspect and victims often say they are
blindfolded.
	   ``Now they sometimes admit that the suspect was tortured, but
they say it is impossible to find out who is responsible,'' said
Martin Flaherty, associate professor of law at Fordham.
	   The mission was also critical of a Turkish law that allows
police to detain suspects for up to seven days without letting them
see a lawyer.

	   BOGOR (JP): The police will release three Juanda University
students this morning after detaining them for almost a month on
charges of allegedly mobbing to death a senior officer.
	   Speaking on behalf of the Bogor Regional Police chief, deputy
chief Lt. Col. Pranowo told The Jakarta Post yesterday that the
students would be freed at 9 a.m. today on three conditions.
	   ``First, they are not allowed to flee. Second, they are
prohibited from damaging or throwing away any evidence they possess
and, finally, they must answer future police summons as soon as
possible whenever called to do so,'' Pranowo said.
	   He refused to explain further but repeated that their case would
be brought to court despite their conditional release from police
custody.
	   Pranowo did not indicate when the three students -- Emon
Wahyudi, Tb. Ade and Syaifullah -- would stand trial over the death
of Second Lt. Dadang, head of the Bogor City Police intelligence
unit. Dadang was allegedly killed during a May 9 student
demonstration on the Juanda University campus.
	   The news of the three students' release did not automatically
appease their 600 colleagues staging a second day of protests in
front of Pranowo's office over the arrests.
	   ``We'll only stop holding this protest when we actually see our
three friends released with our own eyes,'' said Agus Malik,
chairman of the university's student union.
	   The students, who claim their friends are not guilty, also asked
the police to restore the three students' reputation and take
action against those who have tried to intimidate forensic expert
Yuli Budiningsih.
	   Agus said he had been informed that Yuli, who performed the
autopsy of the officer's body and publicly disclosed that Dadang
died of a heart attack, had received mysterious calls lately trying
to intimidate her and her family.
	   Yuli could not be reached for confirmation yesterday.
	   The police decision to release the students was apparently made
after a meeting Wednesday between Bogor Regional Police chief Col.
Abubakar Nataprawira and members of the National Commission on
Human Rights, lawyers and representatives of the university.
	   After the meeting, Juanda University rector Abadi Soetisna urged
the police to unconditionally free the students, saying he strongly
believed that they were not guilty.
	   Abubakar said each of the three students would be charged for
mobbing, torture and fighting against security officers, which
carries a cumulative maximum penalty of between 32 months and 15
years in jail.
	   The police has accused the students of being involved in an
alleged mobbing that led to the death of Dadang.
	   The accusations became controversial when Yuli publicly revealed
her findings.
	   The three students have been reportedly tortured during their
police interrogations. (24/bsr)

	   THE Commonwealth Games Federation will allow the newly set up
Court of Arbitration of Sport to deal with all controversies and
disputes that may arise during the Games in Kuala Lumpur on Sept
11-21.
	   CGF chairman Michael Fennell said CGF decided to have the CAS,
set up by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) lasty year as
it is an independent body which has proven itself.
	   ``There is no cost involved. They reach speedy decision and have
eminent jurists with them,'' said Fennell.
	   He said CAS was present at the Atlanta Olympics and the Winter
Olympics in Nagano.
	   Fennell said CGF, who have remained low profile, have received a
business plan from Anderson Consulting of Malaysia that will be
used to prepare the forward plan.
	   He said the plan will help CGF formulate ways to make the Games
marketable and more attractive.
	   Fennel also said Inter-Pacific Group of Australia will play a
more dominant role in the CGF's marketing plans in future.
	   The Inter-Pacific Group own Contagion, a company that took over
well known sports marketing firm API.
	   The Games introduced in 1930 though rated second to the Olympics
have not been a commercial success.
	   CGF intend to make it profitable venture for future host.

	   JAKARTA (JP): State oil and gas company Pertamina said yesterday
it would maintain its contracts with former president
Soeharto-linked contractors and suppliers, provided they were
efficient and the government allowed them to continue their
operations.
	   The secretary of Pertamina's board of commissioners, Rachmat
Soedibjo, told The Jakarta Post that some Soeharto-linked companies
were run efficiently.
	   From a technical point of view, he said, such companies deserved
to continue operating.
	   However, he said, the future of Soeharto-linked companies'
operations within Pertamina was not merely determined by technical
considerations but also by political ones, since there was a
growing demand from the public to reject all businesses connected
to Soeharto.
	   ``What Pertamina thinks technically good can be considered bad
politically. It is thus the minister of mines and energy (Kuntoro
Mangkusubroto), as the company's president commissioner, who will
make a final decision,'' he said.
	   Rachmat is also the minister's expert aide for oil and gas
affairs.
	   Pertamina is currently registering all its contractors and
suppliers linked to Soeharto's family and cronies following the
government's announcement last week to fight collusion, corruption
and nepotism in the company.
	   Pertamina has been seen for a long time as the country's worst
symbol of nepotism due to the domination of Soeharto's family and
cronies in its operations.
	   Kuntoro said the government would review all Pertamina's
contracts awarded to politically connected companies in an effort
to improve its efficiency and management.
	   Pertamina president Soegianto said last week the company had
thus far registered 120 politically connected contractors and
suppliers. The final number could be higher as the listing has not
yet been completed.
	   He said the list of companies would be further broken down into
efficient and inefficient categories.
	   Rachmat said that although the companies initially gained
contracts thanks to their political connections, some of them could
work efficiently.
	   One of them, he said, is the shipment of Pertamina's liquefied
natural gas (LNG) by the publicly listed shipping company PT
Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi, controlled by Soeharto's youngest
son Hutomo Mandala Putra, alias Tommy.
	   The company's 1997 annual report says the company currently
operates three tankers to ship Pertamina's LNG, including the
world's largest LNG tanker of 78,988 deadweight tons (DWT), called
Darmaputra.
	   The tanker, which is 95 percent owned by Humpuss and 5 percent
by Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines, was contracted to Pertamina for 20
years until 2010.
	   Pertamina has also contracted eight Humpuss' tankers to ship its
crude oil to export markets until between 2005 and 2009.
	   Rachmat did not say if Humpuss also operated efficiently in
shipping Pertamina's crude oil. (jsk)

	   PENANG, Thurs. - The public has been urged to buy Malaysian-made
generic pharmaceutical products as they are much cheaper than
imported ones.
	   Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society council member and
vice-chairman of its Penang Area Committee, Associate Professor Dr
Yuen Kah Hay, said: ``In Malaysia, there are more than 40 companies
manufacturing generic products. Thus, if we buy locally-made
generic products, the country and consumers can save on the outflow
of the ringgit.''
	   He said imported products, both generic and original, were
estimated to make up 70 per cent of the market.
	   A generic product is the reproduction of the drug after the
patent of the original product expires.
	   Yuen said the main difference between a generic and original
product was the price.
	   ``Locally-made generic products are between one fifth and one
quarter of the price of the imported original products. Imported
generic drugs are one third to half the price of the original
products,'' Yuen said.
	   The generic products undergo stringent tests before they are
approved by the Malaysian Drug Regulatory Agency to meet the
criteria underlined by the agency, added Yuen, a lecturer at
Universiti Sains Malaysia's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
	   Treasurer of the society and lecturer at USM's School of
Pharmaceutical Sciences Dr Peh Kok Khiang said products approved by
the agency bore registration numbers beginning with the letters
``MAL'' or ``PBKD''.

	   THE Fisheries Department is drafting a new set of regulations
under the Fisheries Act 1985 to further protect the population of
turtles in the country, the department's head of marine parks
section Kevin W.P. Hiew said.
	   The five endangered species of the turtles are the leatherback,
hawksbill, olive ridley, green turtles and the painted terrapins.
	   Hiew said the new regulations are aimed at improving the
existing ones, which focus on the control of collecting turtle
eggs.
	   ``We are trying to standardise the regulations ... hopefully,
the new draft can be accepted by all state governments,'' he told
reporters in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   Turtles' conservation and protection matters are under the
jurisdiction of all state governments. Under the Fisheries Act
1985, the state governments have the right to enact new rules to
conserve turtle eggs.
	   Hiew said most states have regulations on the matter but there
are others such as Selangor and Perlis which have yet to implement
them.
	   ``Enforcement alone is not the answer ... to be effective, it is
important to have educational programmes to educate the public on
the need to protect and conserve the turtles,'' he said, adding
that the department began working on the new draft early this year.
	   A roadshow is also planned as part of the Fisheries Department's
campaign on Marine Turtle Conservation and Protection which was
launched by Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud in
March.
	   ``The campaign aims to educate the public, especially villagers,
who are directly involved in selling and eating turtle eggs,'' Hiew
said.
	   He said the department is willing to buy these eggs from the
villagers so that they could be safely hatched.
	   ``This way, they will not lose their income and the beaches can
continue to become an attractive tourist destination,'' he said,
adding that the landing and nestling of the turtle population has
decreased by 95 per cent since the 1960s.
	   He also said that although the price of a turtle egg can reach
almost RM2, it has less nutritional value than a chicken egg which
costs about 25 sen.
	   The department has 15 hatcheries in Peninsular Malaysia which
produced over one million eggs. The department has released almost
750,000 baby turtles into the sea since 1991.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Association of Indonesian Insurance Brokers
(ABAI) hailed the Insurance Council of Indonesia's decision to
approve payments to victims of the recent rioting, but warned that
a banking clause in some policies may prevent the claimants from
receiving their money.
	   ``Some of the insurance claims are bound by a banking clause
which states that the claimant's creditors are entitled to any
insurance payments,'' the association said in a statement.
	   ``ABAI is concerned about what might happen if the settlements
take place according to the banking clause and claimants' creditor
banks offset the claims against outstanding loans,'' the
association added.
	   The association called on the country's banking sector to give
special treatment to riot victims whose premises were damaged
during last months rioting so that they could quickly begin to
rebuild their shattered businesses.
	   Without such help many would simply not be able to reopen for
business because it was simply not possible to take out new loans
at the current high interest rates, the statement said.
	   The council announced Wednesday that owners of shopping centers,
shop-houses and shops damages during the riots could submit claims
to insurance companies if their policies included cover for riots,
strikes and malicious damage.
	   Three days of rioting which began in Jakarta on May 13 caused at
least Rp 2.5 trillion (US$227.27 billion) in damages, according to
the official government estimate released last month.
	   The Indonesian Retail Merchants Association has also said that
33 of its members suffered losses worth Rp 661.52 billion when
their outlets were looted. The figure does not include damaged
caused by fire and vandalism. (das)

	   KLANG, Thurs. - The Selangor branch of the Royal Customs and
Excise Department will launch a month-long operation from today,
against factory operators who fail to settle their sales tax.
	   Operasi Cukai Dalaman will be carried out in stages to ensure
all factories, including those in rural areas, are checked by the
department's enforcement officers.
	   Earlier, five Customs officers headed by the department's
internal taxation assistant director Gnatuadan Mohd Othman checked
three factories in Meru and found that all three had failed to
settle their taxes.
	   During the operation, Customs officers sealed one of the
factories and seized some 30 boxes of glasses from another, while
the third factory paid its sales tax amounting to RM35,000.
	   Customs internal taxation division senior assistant director
Abdul Rahman Ahmad said records showed that nine out of the 3,000
manufacturers in Selangor had not settled their dues, despite being
issued with reminders.
	   He said the department would not hesistate to fine and seize
goods from those who failed to settle their taxes.

India studying demands by five nuclear powers
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS comment from separatist in Indian-held Kashmir. Minor
editing throughout. No pickup.  
  With UN-India-Pakistan  
  By ASHOK SHARMA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Friday mulled over demands by
the five original nuclear powers that it and rival neighbor
Pakistan give up their nuclear ambitions and resolve issues fueling
their rivalry, including the dispute over the border region of
Kashmir.
	   India will give its response after ``closely examining''
Thursday's joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States, the Press Trust of
India news agency quoted foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh as
saying.
	   Last month, India conducted a series of nuclear tests, saying ti
needed a nuclear defense against Pakistan and its other neighbor
China. Pakistan responded last week with its own tests, setting off
fears the longstanding South Asian rivalry could culminate with
nuclear war.
	   Meeting Thursday in Geneva, the foreign ministers of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council offered to help
India and Pakistan resolve their differences, especially their
competing claims to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   But the main responsibility for making peace is theirs, said
Tang Jiaxuan of China, who led the meeting.
	   New Delhi has in the past rejected any outside pressure to
settle the Kashmir dispute, the flash point of two of India's three
wars with Pakistan in the past 50 years. Pakistan, though, wants
Kashmir to be discussed in an international forum, believing it is
at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks with larger and more powerful
India.
	   In Geneva, representatives of the local government of
Pakistan-held Kashmir welcomed the discussion of Kashmir. The
foreign ministers have said in a statement that ``without a
permanent solution of the Kashmir issue, peace in the region cannot
be guaranteed.''
	   Syed Ali Shah Geelani, head of a group opposed to New Delhi's
rule of its two-thirds share of Kashmir, also welcomed the Geneva
declaration during a speech at Friday Muslim prayers in Srinagar,
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's national government did not immediately react to the
Geneva deliberations.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Parliament on
Thursday that his government was prepared to discuss Kashmir
bilaterally with Pakistan.
	   The Geneva statement also asked India and Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without conditions.
	   Soon after conducting its tests, India said it planned no more
but wouldn't sign the treaty in its present form because it allows
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to keep their
nuclear arsenals. Pakistan says it will sign the CTBT only if India
adhered to it.
	   Though India and Pakistan now claim to be capable of building
nuclear bombs, the five nations who were the first to perfect
weapons of mass destruction refused to welcome any new members into
their club of nuclear powers, as defined by the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters they
could not let any other nation on the nuclear threshold believe it
``can test its way in.''
	   Albright and the other ministers said that Pakistan and India
should refrain from any more tests, from building or deploying
nuclear weapons, or from testing missiles to carry nuclear bombs.
Many fear the next stage of the costly, potentially catastrophic
South Asian nuclear arms race will be developing delivery systems.
	   The ministers did not threaten sanctions, which the United
States has been alone among the five in imposing.
	   Sanctions only hurt the people and neighboring countries and
``have little effect on leaders who often act in isolation and
sometimes unpredictably,'' said Russia's Yevgeny Primakov.

	   NYLEX (Malaysia) Bhd will give priority to stringent working
capital management and overall cost control throughout the group,
according to its chairman Graeme Charles Pearson in the company's
latest annual report.
	   For the financial year ended December 31 1997, the group
recorded a pre- tax profit of RM69.89 million compared to RM82.11
million the previous year. Turnover went up to RM590.94 million
from RM578.23 million in 1996.
	   After tax profit was RM50.15 million. At company level, pre-tax
profit was at RM41.92 million on the back of a turnover of RM90.96
million.
	   Earnings per ordinary share fell to 20.66 sen for the financial
year under review compared to 25.07 sen the previous year.
	   The polymer division of the company displayed an increase of 8.3
per cent in sales and has entrenched itself as the market leader in
the domestic film and coated fabric sector as well as leading
supplier of engineering plastic products.
	   The group's engineering division, according to Pearson, is
beginning to reap rewards from the overseas investments especially
those servicing the Indonesian and Hong Kong markets which recorded
commendable sales and profit results.
	   Additionally, the building products division performed well the
second half of the year and its performance is expected to be
maintained by its new furnace which features the latest energy
savings technology.
	   However, the packaging division which is experiencing production
constraint will be renewed and upgraded.
	   Nylex (M) has also made preparations to meet the possible impact
of the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem that may arise.
	   A final dividend of 7.75 sen per share less tax has been
recommended.

  Eds: UPDATES with Eritreans shooting down two Ethiopian aircraft;
thousands of residents celebrate, Ethiopia claims attack in
retaliation for Eritrean strike on Mekele; no pickup  
  By JULIA STEWART  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ As Eritrea vowed that it would never give
in ``to the language of force and intimidation,'' two Ethiopian
military aircraft twice bombed an Eritrean air force base Friday in
Asmara.
	   Eritrean anti-aircraft guns then downed the two Ethiopian
aircraft, and thousands of jubilant Asmara residents rushed into
the streets to celebrate, waving their young nation's red, blue and
green flag.
	   No details were immediately available on casualties from the air
strikes in which two hangers at the air base were hit. The airport
is next door to Asmara's international airport from where chartered
aircraft were to evacuate hundreds of foreign nationals, including
at least 200 Americans, later Friday.
	   As far as could be determined, the airport itself was not hit.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
the airport strike was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on
Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis.
	   The ministry said five Ethiopians were wounded in the air strike
on Mekele.
	   Reliable Ethiopian sources said fighting continued for the third
day Friday around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded
tank, artillery and mortar fire.
	   In Asmara, a U. S. Embassy spokeswoman said plans to evacuate
200 U.S. citizens, mainly dependents of government employees,
non-essential embassy staff and Peace Corps volunteers, later
Friday to Frankfurt were going ahead as scheduled.
	   In Israel, radios reported staff at the Israeli Embassy was
being evacuated from Eritrea and only three diplomats would remain
at the Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was wearing
thin because of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory
Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   ``I am not declaring war in Eritrea. I am only saying enough is
enough to Eritrean aggression,'' Meles said after announcing that
the army had orders to ``take all necessary measures against
repeated Eritrean aggression.''
	   Shortly before the bombing, the government of Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki had issued a statement expressing ``its firm
commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
	   But it said it would never ``acquiesce to the language of force
and intimidation and weill, if necessary, resolutely defend its
hard-won right to live in peace and freedom.''
	   Meles was speaking Thursday to reporters to announce acceptance
of a four-point proposal by the United States and Rwanda to end a
festering border conflict peacefully.
	   One of the recommendations of the proposal was that Eritrea
withdrawn to positions held before May 6.
	   The Eritrean government statement Friday characterized the four
points as ``not controversial'' but said Eritrea believed there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out.''
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.

	   KEDAH manager Datuk Shariff Abu Samah will double up as coach
for their next two matches as coach Fisol Razak and his assistant
Azman Eusoff have been suspended for three and two matches
respectively.
	   The duo, together with assistant manager Saaban Ismail, were
found guilty by the FAM disciplinary board for intimidating referee
Abdul Ghani Ishak after the Kedah-Pahang match at the Darulaman
stadium in Alor Setar on May 26.
	   ``It is rather unfortunate that we have to be without a coach
for at least the next two matches,'' said Shariff.
	   ``But we have to abide by the decision of the disciplinary
committee and adjust ourselves acordingly.''
	   Shariff said that he has no choice but to double up as a coach
when they play Kuala Lumpur tomorrow and Kelantan in the FA Cup
second leg tie in Kota Baru on Tuesday.
	   ``But I am sure that we can continue to win matches even without
the coaches at the bench as I have full confidence in the
players,'' he said.
	   ``I am sure that the senior players in the team will be able to
assist me.''
	   Shariff said that the players are well aware of the concern of
the coaches which led to their suspension.
	   ``The players know very well that the coaches and the management
care for them,'' he said. ``And I am confident that they will do
their best to win the two matches for them.''
	   Shariff was also very concerned about the suspension rate in his
team and has told his players in no uncertain terms that they must
keep their cool always.
	   ``I told them to play a clean game and try and avoid getting
booked,'' he said. ``They must learn to play a clean game even if
they are provoked by their opponents.''
	   On tomorrow's match against Kuala Lumpur, Shariff said that they
will treat their opponents with caution.
	   Speedy striker Nidzam Adzha Yusoff has recovered from injury.
	   That should make up for the absence of Brazilian Carlos Roberio.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A mystery which has long puzzled the world's top
scientists appears to have finally been solved by a team of physics
experts working in a mine shaft in central Japan.
	   But the finding, announced Friday, still needs to be re-tested
before quieting skeptics.
	   An international team of 120 researchers said they have found
evidence that elusive, subatomic particles known as neutrinos _ one
of the basic building blocs of atoms _ have mass, or weight.
	   The finding was presented Friday at a physics conference in the
central Japanese city of Takayama by a group known as the
Super-Kamiokande Experiment research team composed of experts from
Japan, the United States, Germany and Poland.
	   What has many scientists around the world so excited about the
announcement is that, if true, it would force the rethinking of a
widely-accepted theory which states neutrinos are devoid of weight.
	   And it would answer a nagging question as to why the universe is
actually so much heavier than most models suggest it should be.
	   It also raises the intriguing possibility that the universe may
not keep expanding forever in the wake of the so-called Big Bang,
which started it all.
	   But not everyone is convinced.
	   Arthur McDonald, a professor of physics at Queen's University in
Kingston, Ontario, who heads another team conducting similar
research, cautioned it will take time to verify the results.
	   Paul Langacker, chairman of the department of physics and
astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the finding is
the most exciting he has heard about in his 20-year career.
	   ``It is a very significant step forward,'' Langacker said.
	   But he added, ``If there were any weaknesses, it could be that
there were effects associated with the earth's magnetic field that
could cause distortions in the cosmic rays and mimic an effect like
this.''
	   To guard against such distortions, the Kamiokande team worked in
an abandoned mine shaft, burying their equipment in a kilometer
(half-mile) of rock to block cosmic rays and radiation.
	   Neutrinos are difficult to track because they have no electrical
charge and are so small that they pass right through matter.
	   The group used a 50,000-ton tank filled with purified water to
catch a glimpse of sparks created when neutrinos, part of the
trillions of particles that pass through the earth every second,
collide with atoms.
	   Though the scientists have not measured neutrino mass, they say
they detected that some neutrinos oscillate, or change type, as
they pass through space or matter. A key scientific theory says
anything that oscillates must have mass.
	   Yet physics' ``standard model'' theory of how fundamental
particles work decrees that neutrinos should weigh nothing at all.
It is this theory which may need to be revised because of the new
finding.
	   Neutrino mass could help explain why astronomers can't find 90
percent of the matter that's supposed to exist in the universe.
	   Given the speed at which the universe is expanding, physicists
think the universe should be of a certain mass. But when they add
up the weight of the planets, stars and all other known stuff in
the cosmos they get a number only 10 percent as large as their
theory predicts.
	   That inconsistency has lead many to conclude either that much
more of the universe is hidden in mysterious dark spots or that the
theory is seriously flawed.
	   The mass of an individual neutrino is perhaps billions of times
less than an electron, the particle with the smallest known mass.
But together all the neutrinos could account for a big part the
universe's mysteriously missing mass.
	   If the universe has enough mass, it must contract at some point
because of the pull of its own gravity.

	   BANDUNG (JP): Our comforting belief that the earth's climate was
essentially unchanged through the ages has been shot down.
Meteorological data compiled over the past century, augmented by
recent findings from space observation of the earth, shows
convincingly that the earth is warming and that its atmosphere has
undergone continuous change.
	   Careful analysis indicates conclusively that the world's climate
cooled down from about 1940 to 1970. Since then the temperature has
been on the increase. There has been a growing realization that
significant climatic changes have occurred on earth in a broad
spectrum of time, ranging from decades to some million of years.
	   Astronomically speaking, the changes of the longer periods are
not unexpected, but observed changes of a shorter time scale affect
us more because they impinge on our lives.
	   Studying short and long-period atmospheric changes is not only
important as an intellectual exercise to understand the past
climatic change on our planet, but also extremely useful for
practical reasons in order to predict the future of humankind.
	   Problems related to harvests are a good example. In many areas,
in particular in developing countries, the harvest is closely
linked to survival, whether it be on local or regional levels.
Prolonged disturbances of weather in some areas may affect regional
or even national life patterns.
	   Good crops are indeed results of the combination of weather,
input technology and social planning. Disruption of one of these
factors will change the expected yields, if there is no additional
input for other undisrupted factors. Foresight on these three
aspects is therefore a necessary ingredient for understanding
crops.
	   Our highly agricultural system in the latter half of the 20th
century -- driven by the heavy use of technology to manipulate
natural environment -- may have created our ignorance about the
very basic factors affecting good crops. This results in a feeling
that our life and activities are insulated from the long range
weather variations. Some of us are inclined to think the sources of
our staple foods come from a nearby grocery, rather than from lands
which farmers cultivate.
	   Millions of people still depend directly on land and on
weather-dependent harvests. Statistics on world hunger and
malnutrition are still frightful despite the input technology, the
green revolution introduced since the 1960s. It appears that many
who suffer famine are from areas which are deprived, momentarily or
permanently, of ``good'' weather and scientific knowledge about
weather and meteorology.
	   It has been shown by agricultural scientists responsible for the
green revolution that the dramatic increase in world agricultural
productivity was only temporary in order to buy a little more time
for humanity to solve the problem of nutrition. Experience showed
that in order to achieve an additional increase of crops, more
energy is needed so that the machinery of climate-crop-consumer
operates properly.
	   History has its examples. In the winter of 1977, Florida and
California, two major winter vegetable producing regions in the
U.S., were hit by, respectively, frost and drought which caused
crop yields to drop below necessary levels. In 1972, global weather
was erratic due to a solar disturbance. This climatic anomaly
resulted in a harsh winter followed by a dry, hot summer in many
northern countries, as well as monsoon failures in India and
Indonesia. The total world food production was estimated to drop by
2 percent to 3 percent. Still vivid in our memory is the 1997
drought in the country which caused low rice yield.
	   Weather is an important ingredient in conducting human affair.
Now, as our awareness increases, we are entering an era
characterized by syndromes of global change that stem from the
interdependence between human development and climate. The change
of lifestyle in human communities may bring about change and should
aim at the improvement of the environment. In turn, the new outlook
embraces the ethics in which human beings view our natural
environment as the most reliable partner to produce a rich
ecological variety to sustain life on earth. Otherwise our task as
the custodian of life on earth could not be fulfilled.
	   Global change, as it manifests in the warming of the earth's
atmosphere, will affect us all. The important thing is to realize
that the effect of global change may be creeping slowly and
producing different results in different geographic settings. Poor
and rich people, on a national as well as on a regional scale, are
likely to place different values on economic growth and
environmental conservation.
	   It would take a long time before we can build a consensus about
interactions between people and the atmospheric environmental. It
should be managed in tandem with the ideals of sustainable
development.
	   Two major areas of global concern, namely the changing
atmosphere and development of living environment in developing
countries, must be addressed without delay and in proper
perspective.
	   They must be solved to bridge the understanding between the
developed and less developed countries.
	   Fossil fuel
	   Concerns are the use of fossil fuel in developed countries and
the atmospheric pollution in developing countries. Rapid and
unfettered economic growth fueled by vast quantities of fossil
fuels in developed countries, and the widespread damaged stimulated
by poverty and high population growth in many developing countries,
have caused worrisome increase in atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
	   This may produce shifts in climate. Man has learned how to cope
with gradual change rather easily, but a sudden, disruptive,
abnormality requires better social preparations and understanding
between government agencies and the food-producing sectors.
	   The threat of global climate change with its accompanying
biological, economic and social disruptions will make the goals of
sustainable development farther away for many nations.
	   Deforestation
	   Mismanagement of tropical forests has been considered the
culprit of atmospheric damage. Tropical forests provide a wealth of
goods and services. They contain a substantial bank of stored
carbon and form important reservoirs of biological diversity. Due
to the pressure of population and economic imperatives,
deforestation is occurring in many areas in the tropics.
	   The result of the deforestation is believed to contribute to the
buildup of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Estimates of the
contribution of tropical deforestation to global carbon dioxide
buildup vary considerably and, most likely, half of the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is derived from the use of fossil fuels.
	   The uncertainties associated with estimating this figure are due
to the difficulties involved in estimating the global conversion
rate. Factors like vegetation regrowth, carbon content of various
forest types and the rate of flux of carbon between vegetation and
atmosphere combine and should not be overlooked.
	   Forests are not only regulators of the atmospheric transfer of
latent heat and moisture but also processors of trace gases and, at
the same time, an economic asset. So are the fossil fuels and the
production of other greenhouse gases. Planning of economic growth
will therefore implicitly touch these matters.
	   Unfortunately, many of the discussions related to economic
growth result in a national policy which inadvertently accelerates
the rate of fossil fuel consumption and deforestation. The policy
should be reviewed critically before we loose our most valuable
natural assets of tropical forest which store so much genetic and
valuable biodiversity.
	   Economic growth is, on the other hand, a battle cry with which a
nation brings prosperity to her people. It is therefore
understandable that taming economic growth would be a political
drawback; it is the last action a politician can afford to do.
	   A political view should be weighed against long-term development
and global issues of public property, such as the wealth of
forestry. In a sense one should be more aware of the future of our
nationhood and the uniqueness of Earth as the natural habitat for
humankind.
	   With increasing concern about global climate change, which may
lead to global warming effects due to imbalance in the carbon
cycle, studies have been made to find out how to reduce the carbon
emission to the atmosphere. This implies the study of less
energy-intensive technologies and less carbon-intensive fuels.
	   It is gratifying to know that such aspects have been taken
seriously and that studies under various economics and demographic
conditions have been carried out.
	   However, one should not forget that the atmosphere is in fact a
very complicated laboratory where many chemical reactions are
taking place. There is still room for ``speculation'' about
atmospheric chemistry, but progress in atmospheric sciences is
already encouraging, making people more aware of our atmosphere.
	   At the same time, the atmospheric science should encourage
development of natural science in our country and should foster
international cooperation. This provides a forum for Indonesian
scientists to participate in worldwide science undertakings.
	   We have embarked upon what are called ``large-scale geophysical
experiments'', which lead to the birth of new ethics of using and
exploiting natural resources as well as science of other
global-warming related phenomena.
	   Indonesia is keenly aware of the adverse effects of the global
warming. Policies are being developed in order to accommodate the
impact of this global phenomena. However, more atmospheric research
and monitoring are needed in order to secure our position in the
world's scientific community.

ICRC condemns Sierra Leone rebels for atrocities

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The International Committee of the
Red Cross said hundreds of villagers have been killed and more than
1,000 mutilated in recent months by Sierra Leone's ousted junta
fighters.
	   More than 140 civilians were being treated in hospitals after
the renegade soldiers hacked off their arms or legs. Others bore
deep multiple cuts to the face and body, the ICRC said in a
statement issued Friday.
	   The ICRC condemned the atrocities and called on the former junta
and allied rebel forces to respect civilians. An International Red
Cross team was being sent to Sierra Leone to aid local medical
staff, who are overwhelmed and ill-equipped to deal with the
tragedy.
	   Junta troops loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma were ousted by
a West African intervention force that reinstalled Sierra Leone
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in March.
	   United Nations agencies and other international groups have
roundly accused the rebels of seeking revenge against defenseless
civilians.

Peres edges close to acknowledging Israel's nuclear capability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Edging close to acknowledging that Israel is a
nuclear power, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Friday that
the Jewish state pursued a nuclear option to prevent war.
	   Israel has never acknowledged that it has nuclear weapons,
saying only it would not be the first to use them in the region.
Western intelligence reports say the country is the only nuclear
power in the Mideast and has a significant stockpile.
	   Peres was the main force behind the establishment of Israel's
nuclear reactor in the southern Negev Desert town of Dimona in the
1950s. At the time, he was director general of the Defense Ministry
and a confidant of then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.
	   Asked by Israel TV's Channel Two why Dimona was built, Peres
said he hoped at the time it would help Israel negotiate peace
agreements with its Arab neighbors.
	   ``Even then, I think we had Oslo in mind, and not Hiroshima,''
Peres said, referring to the interim peace agreements with the
Palestinians his government signed between 1993 and 1995. ``No one
made a bomb to use it. Instead, we wanted a veiled nuclear option
in order to prevent war.''
	   Excerpts of the interview were broadcast Friday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - High rentals for the use of facilities at
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang have been
identified as one of the contributing factors to the fares
structure announced yesterday.
	   It was learnt that besides the parking fees for limousines and
executive coaches, operators of public transport also have to pay
rent for the ticketing counters.
	   ``Various factors, including operating cost, were taken into
consideration in working out the fare structure for public
transportation at KLIA,'' a source said.
	   Yesterday, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed announced public transportation fares ranging from RM6.50
to RM88 for a one-way trip to the KLIA.
	   The fare is for a range of transport services, which includes
KTM Bhd Komuter trains.
	   The limousine service would be operated by Airport Limo Bhd and
the executive coach service by Kuala Lumpur City Bus.
	   Elaborating, the source said Airport Limo wanted more than 10
counters set up at various locations. It was charged RM3,500 a
month as rent for each counter.
	   Besides this, the source added, the rent for the executive coach
and limousine terminal was reported to be about RM100,000 a month.
	   The consortiums awarded the transportation contracts are making
arrangements to lease both temporary and long-term queue bays.
	   ``Taking into consideration the overhead operating costs
involved, it's not surprising the consortiums are charging such
rates,'' the source said.
	   He added that discussions were continuing on ways to reduce
rates.
	   It is understood that the Commercial Vehicle Licensing Board,
which comes under the Entrepreneur Development Ministry, is aware
of the matter and kept constantly informed of developments.
	   Commenting on the fare structure, the president of the
Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association, Hamdan Adnan, said
they were generally high.
	   He urged Malaysia Airports Bhd to be more reasonable instead of
being profit-oriented.
	   ``One only has to compare express bus fares from the city to
Seremban and that of those announced for KLIA,'' he added.

	   BERLIN (JP): Children can help save water, too. That assumption
drives the Berlin water company's inclusion of children as a target
in its campaign to cut excessive water consumption.
	   ``Educating children is an important step to reduce high water
consumption,'' said Wolfgang Ulbrich, head of the company.
	   The problem is sizable: it is estimated that each of the city's
less than four million residents consume 130 liters of freshwater
per day.
	   Efforts to reduce the high water consumption include inviting
schoolchildren to visit the company's waterworks to observe the
process of making groundwater potable.
	   ``It's effective. By seeing the process themselves, they will
understand the need to value water and when they get home the
children will tell their parents to do the same,'' Ulbrich said.
	   The children also learn how they can save water during everyday
routines, such as turning off the tap while they are brushing their
teeth.
	   Berlin is highly dependent on groundwater as the main source of
its drinking water.
	   ``The groundwater table is not increasing, so we have to protect
them by reducing people's water consumption instead,'' Ulbrich
said.
	   He warned a water crisis was a serious threat to people's
survival unless serious anticipative measures were taken.
	   Although 70 percent of the world is covered with water, 97.5
percent is saltwater, leaving just 2.5 percent of freshwater to
support human life in the form of surface water, such as lakes,
rivers and groundwater.
	   A recent report by the World Wide Fund for Nature found water
crises were not usually caused by natural factors, such as drought,
but by human mismanagement through pollution, improper water
resource management and inadequate legislation and regulations to
address the problems.
	   But, in many parts of the world, the current patterns in the
development and use of freshwater resources are not sustainable,
either from economic, social or environmental points of view.
	   The United Nations estimated that under the current patterns of
water use, an estimated two-thirds of the total world population
may well face moderate to severe water crises by 2025, compared to
one third at present.
	   Zoning
	   In Berlin, tap water is potable. The groundwater is treated in
11 waterworks spread throughout the city. To assure its safety, the
company conducts random tests everyday, aside from regular tests
five times a week in 384 testing spots.
	   Berlin has done a lot to protect its precious groundwater.
	   Back in 1986, the authority introduced stricter limits on
drinking water, such as by imposing three zoning systems
surrounding its groundwater sources.
	   In the 10-meter zone, one is not allowed to camp or use
pesticides on plants to prevent chemical contamination. In the 150
to 200 meters zone, no transport of contaminated liquid is allowed.
	   In the 2.5-kilometer zone, gas stations are prohibited.
	   Ulbrich said that the zoning system was imposed as human actions
can affect groundwater quality.
	   Waste discharges from motor vehicles, homes, offices, industries
as well as chemicals and animal wastes from agricultural
production, can create contaminated run-off, of which some seeps
into groundwater, he said.
	   ``Initially, people were complaining about the zoning system.
But later on, they started to understand that it was for their own
sake.''
	   Even though no legal sanctions will be imposed on the zoning's
violators, a team is assigned to monitor each zoning area.
	   ``If there's a violation, we'll talk to them (violators),'' he
said.
	   Most Berliners do not need to be told about the need to protect
groundwater.
	   City resident Peter Prfert said he understood the authority's
aim in protecting groundwater.
	   ``I don't want to drink contaminated groundwater... so, the
zoning system is fine with me.''
	   The authority also strictly regulates construction work in the
city which could threaten groundwater tables.
	   ``If construction work hits a groundwater table, they should
pump them out and add them to another groundwater table. The
purpose is to make the groundwater table reach the same level,''
Ulbrich said.

	   Sanusi said after handing out ASK dividends to more than 100
hardcore poor from various districts here today.
	   However, he declined to reveal details of the nature of the
article or name the magazine. It is learnt that the magazine is the
Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   ASK was set up in February 1995 as an investment unit for
Bumiputeras abiding by Syariah principles. Last year it declared a
13 per cent dividend.
	   On the eradication of poverty in Kedah, which until a couple of
years ago had the largest percentage of poor in the country, Sanusi
said the rate had been reduced.
	   He added that due to the ringgit's depreciation, the people
should stop purchasing imported goods.
	   On the rule requiring entertainment outlets to close on Thursday
nights, Sanusi said the regulations had to be enforced because the
operators had failed to abide by the regulations pertaining to
Muslims and the underage which has caused social problems.
	   Sanusi said if the operators could convince the State Government
of strict compliance with the regulations, then their pleas to open
on Thursday nights for non-Muslims may be considered.
	   He added that the operators could submit their applications and
the State authorities would consider the requests depending on the
merits of each case.
	   As for hotels, he said they could have whatever entertainment
they wanted for their guests especially foreigners, but they too
must follow rules.

	   In various recent happenings, mainly since security forces took
repressive measures against reform activists on student campuses
and other places, social, economic and political impacts of a
detrimental nature have been strongly felt in the marginal
community. This was apparent when riots occurred at a number of
places and various acts of violence were committed against people
and property in the form of shootings, burnings, extortion,
looting, torture and even various forms of physical and sexual
violence against women.
	   In Medan, 20 Teachers' Training College students have filed
reports declaring themselves victims of sexual harassment conducted
by police when the girls were leaving their campus to look for
public transportation on May 4. They were subjected to highly
improper treatment. They were undressed, forced to run and do
pushups. Their breasts were pawed. People heard about this and felt
angered and insulted.
	   In Jakarta, it was reported that various forms of violence and
sexual harassment had taken place during the Trisakti May 12
incident.
	   Again, other extremely serious incidents occurred during various
riots between May 13 and May 15 in Jakarta and its peripheral
areas. A number of ethnic Chinese women were stripped of their
clothes by a group of people and forced to swim in a pond in the
Daan Mogot area. Rape reportedly took place publicly at Glodok.
There were many more sexual harassment cases against ethnic Chinese
women in residential areas.
	   The above-mentioned facts show an increase in the intensity of
violence against women, which renders the position of women
susceptible, both in various small groups in the community and in
public places with the involvement of the state apparatus.
	   Article 2 of the UN Declaration on the Abolishment of Violence
against Women states that violence against women includes physical,
sexual and psychological acts of violence which are
committed/justified by the State wherever they happen. Furthermore,
as a consequence, it has been determined in the same declaration
that the State shall continuously endeavor to prevent, investigate
and in accordance with national legislation, punish the
perpetrators of violence against women, both committed by the State
and by individuals (article 4).
	   With regard to the above, the Women's Crisis Center, Mitra
Perempuan:
	   1. condemns various acts of physical, sexual and psychological
violence against women committed by anyone, including the state
apparatus, as barbarous and inhuman acts in violation of women's
dignity;
	   2. demands a thorough settlement of the various acts of violence
against women committed by the state apparatus or irresponsible
people;
	   3. urges the victims and other community members not to leave
the matter unsolved, and invites all people to be equally concerned
about the suffering of the victims, to reinforce protection and to
build a more just and egalitarian appreciation of women's dignity.
	   In fact, the struggle for reform also covers demands for a
change of social values, which have so far denied the existence of
women's rights as an integral part of the respect for human values
and basic rights. Women are entitled to live free from all kinds of
fear and all threatening actions.
	   The Women's Crisis Center Mitra Perempuan is in a position to
receive complaints from victims of violence with personal
consultations. Privacy is guaranteed, including the identity of the
person and the information related to each case.

	   THE ocean is a symbol of might, strength and, to some extent,
peace and serenity.
	   But at whatever way one looks upon the ocean, the truth is, as
mighty and infinite as the world's oceans are, they are fragile and
their continued existence and preservation depend heavily on human
actions.
	   As such, it is appropriate that this year's World Environment
Day is themed ``For Life on Earth: Save our Seas'', recognising the
importance of water resources.
	   The United Nations has also declared 1998 the International Year
of the Ocean. This, together with the adoption of the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea, are milestones in the world community's
commitment to reversing the rapid depletion of marine ecosystems.
	   History has shown that man is not a good custodian of the
environment, neither has he been good a steward of the oceans and
coasts.
	   James Gustave Speth, the administrator of the UN Development
Programme, said the world's oceans are resilient and powerful, but
they are finite ecosystems heavily affected by human activity.
	   ``Managing oceans responsibly today will determine whether they
remain a vital and renewable resource for everyone in the next
millennium,'' he said in his message in commemoration of the World
Environment Day.
	   ``Rapid coastal population growth and the resulting increase in
waste disposal, along with intensive agricultural and industrial
pollution, have damaged reefs and other marine habitats,'' he
added.
	   ``More than two-thirds of the world's people live in coastal
areas, and more than half the world's coastal wetlands have been
destroyed by urban development,'' he said Take Malaysia, for
example. More than 50 per cent of the Malaysian population live in
the vicinity of the coastal and estuarine area.
	   According to the World Wide Fund for Nature Malaysia handbook on
Integrated Coastal and Estuarine Area Management, this accounts for
90 per cent of the utilisation of coastal and estuarine natural
resources.
	   Speth added that the loss of wetlands may be costing coastal
fishing communities as much as 4.7 per cent million tonnes of fish
per year.
	   Another source of support to fisheries resources is coral reefs
which also help in preventing coastal erosion by acting as wave
breaks.
	   Major threats to the coral reef ecosystems are unplanned and ad
hoc development along coastal areas and islands.
	   Hunger for land and the drive to reclaim coastal land is also
another threat to the coral reefs.
	   The increasing use of coastal and estuarine natural resources
also corresponds with the demand for increased land space for
infrastructure, towns and villages as well as farming activities.
	   The main socio-economic activities along the Malaysian coastline
area are agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries (along 46 per cent
of the coastal length); and urbanisation, industrialisation and
recreation (16 per cent).
	   Thus, only 36 per cent of the coastal and estuarine land is
undeveloped.
	   Apart from man's inadvertent harm to the coast in the name of
development, the oceans and seas are also threatened by another
malaise, oil spills.
	   One of the region's largest oil spills occurred in 1992 when the
tanker Nagasaki Spirit collided with the container ship Ocean
Blessing, spilling 13,000 tonnes of crude into the strait.
	   More recently, a major oil spill happened in October last year,
when the tanker Evoikos collided with an empty tanker Orapin
Global, 13km off Singapore spilling some 25,000 tonnes of fuel oil
into the sea.
	   The number of collisions recorded in the strait have risen
rapidly in the past year. In the five years to September 1993, the
Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) said there were
490 accidents or fewer than 100 a year.
	   In 1996, however, the figure swelled to 149 and in the first
four months of last year, there were 46 collisions or groundings in
the strait.
	   Among the problems which have been cited as a reason for
increasing incidences of oil spills is the growing traffic
congestion in the Straits of Malacca as well as poor visibility
when many parts of the region were enveloped by the haze.
	   As a result of the magnitude of the oil spills and the economic
as well as biological losses incurred, a contingency plan to tackle
clean up operations was activated.
	   On the international front, the UNDP has launched a Strategic
Initiative for Ocean and Coastal Management to protect the world's
seas by exchanging information about the marine environment among
countries.
	   And it cannot be overstated that the oceans must remain at the
top of the global agenda.
	   As much as one would like to think that the oceans are powerful
and resilient, the actions of man may very well change that.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the woman
credited with single-handedly leading Athens' victorious bid for
the 2004 Olympic Games, was nominated as ambassador-at-large for
Greece on Friday.
	   Premier Costas Simitis, who had tried to persuade
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki to participate in the Athens 2004 organizing
committee, nominated her to the post, the foreign ministry
announced.
	   ``I am deeply honored by the initiative taken by the Greek state
and my country,'' Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said. ``I will give my
best effort to meet the responsibilities of this position.''
	   If approved by the cabinet, she will be responsible for
political matters concerning preparations for the Olympic Games.
	   The charismatic 42-year-old lawyer won international acclaim for
her dynamic management of the Athens Olympic bid, charming foreign
visitors, raising enormous sums of money and dazzling audiences
with her colorful outfits.
	   Although her popularity soared after Greece secured the Games
last September, she had distanced herself from the organizing
committee named this spring. At the time, she said she was
reluctant to leave her home in London to take on an active role in
the body.

	   Now that Indonesia is to have a new political system, which will
probably be more democratic than the old one, it is worth keeping
in mind some general weaknesses of democratic political systems.
	   First, the people may choose leaders who are unwise, dishonest
and incompetent. To prevent this, electors should be as aware and
as well-informed as possible. It is essential to have proper checks
and balances between the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of government. It must be possible to hold leaders to
account and judge their record in power against their preelection
pledges. An effective opposition and skeptical media are
invaluable, and so is a capable civil service loyal to the people.
	   Second, democracy may easily become coercion of the minority by
the majority. Effective guarantees of minority rights are
indispensable. Political parties should not be divided on tribal,
racial or religious lines, since the result is that the largest
tribe is guaranteed a permanent hold on power. A converse problem
is that certain privileged minorities may wield too much influence,
either by being able to swing the election or by holding the
balance of power in the legislature. To prevent this, the party
system should not be unduly fragmented, Also, some issues may be
better decided by referendum than within normal party politics.
	   Third, the government may be too weak to confront outside
forces. Corruption, and even intimidation, work at an individual
level, so strict and constant vigilance is imperative. At a
collective level, policies contrary to popular will may be dictated
by economic agents, the military, religious organizations or
foreign powers. A government needs well-defined and well-understood
goals, so that it can decide rationally when to succumb to such
pressures and when to resist.
	   Fourth, the government may also be too forceful and use its
democratic legitimacy to impose decisions that should be left to
regional and local authorities, traditional leaders or religious
and civic organizations. By doing this, the government will
disempower the people when its goal should be to empower them. A
democratic government should limit its activities to matters which
can only be decided at a national level and leave space for local
and non-governmental organizations to flourish. In this way the
people will have a say in running their own lives not only at
election times but everyday.
	   I hope these factors will be taken into account as Indonesia
prepares a political system for brighter future.

	   In relation to the present social condition, I would like to
suggest the following:
	   a. Many people have lost their jobs because of the monetary
crisis and the recent shop burning and looting, which has forced
many businesses to close down. To these people, sending children to
school is quite a burden. Therefore, to help alleviate this burden,
they must be exempted from paying anything in regard to their
children's schooling. Unless this policy is enforced, many school
children will drop out, a phenomenon not only harmful to human
resources development but also contradictory to the spirit of total
reform.
	   b. It is a public secret that toward the beginning of each new
school year, final examination grades -- known as NEM -- can be
negotiated at certain schools. As this practice obviously exerts an
adverse impact on school children, immediate efforts must be made
to eliminate it.
	   c. There must no longer be any deduction from teachers'
salaries, and sanctions must be imposed on those still engaged in
this practice. To ensure that teachers can live decently and
perform their tasks properly, their salaries must be raised.
	   d. The content of the 1994 curriculum must be reviewed. This
curriculum has drawn much criticism from education experts such as
J. Drost and Mochtar Buchori. Most agree that this curriculum is
burdensome to students, with the result that education in this
country is now in a mess and its quality is the lowest in ASEAN.
	   e. The motto Tut wuri handayani must be made more complete to
read Ing ngarso sung tulodo, ing madyo hambangun karso, tut wuri
handayani, meaning: In front, serving as a model, in the middle,
introducing ideas, at the back, giving positive encouragement. The
spirit drawn from this motto, the legacy of the late Ki Hajar
Dewantoro, freedom fighter, education scholar and founder of Taman
Siswa Educational Institution, must be inculcated in the minds of
pupils so that they will later grow into adults useful to the
nation and the country.
	   f. As it is impossible for the minister of education and culture
to carry out all the above alone, associations such as the teachers
association and the parents and teachers association must be
consolidated so that they perform their function in the interest of
pupils, pupils' parents, teachers in particular and the education
circles in Indonesia in general.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The Public Service Department today
confirmed that fewer sponsorships for students to local
universities will be made available this year.
	   PSD director-general Tan Sri Dr Mazlan Ahmad said the department
was in the process of finalising the number of loans and
scholarships for local university students.
	   ``Most of the sponsorships will be given under the Education
Ministry's National Higher Education Fund,'' he said.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference held at the Malaysian
Industry- Government Group for High Technology office in Wisma
PKNS.
	   Mazlan said students would be informed through their
universities on when they could apply for PSD scholarships.
	   Currently, the PSD is sponsoring 5,545 students abroad. It has
been reported that the total sum needed to finance these students
is RM280 million.
	   It has also been reported that PSD is expected to spend about
RM300 million sponsoring students at local universities.

	   I wonder where Mr. Muhd. Ramzy Hasibuan was on May 20 and May 21
(President Habibie's legitimacy, Your Letters, June 4) when news
started swirling about that Soeharto was going to step down,
culminating in Habibie's rise to the presidency. Habibie was not
elected, Mr. Hasibuan, he was appointed.
	   And even that could well be legally and/or constitutionally
questionable, because Soeharto appointed Habibie, after, I repeat,
after declaring that: ``from the moment I read this statement, I
cease to be president.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Original equipment manufacturers have
been asked to go beyond merely manufacturing high technology
products according to multi-national companies' specifications.
	   Science Adviser to the Prime Minister's Department Tan Sri Dr
Omar Abdul Rahman said Malaysian-owned OEMs needed to upgrade their
technological capacity to overcome problems if their principals
decided to stop production when components and equipment were no
longer in demand.
	   OEMs are contractors or sub-contractors which receive
specifications from the principal for the manufacture of equipment
and components.
	   Omar said OEMs did what was asked of them and, thus far, had not
improved the manufacturing process or capacity of products.
	   ``We need companies to look beyond that,'' he said, ``so that
when the principal company does not want to continue with a
particular product, they can go into other products.''
	   Omar, who is also joint chairman of the Malaysian
Industry-Government Group for High Technology, was speaking at a
Press conference at the MIGHT office in Wisma PKNS today after a
visit from Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim
Ali.
	   Omar said both the products and the processes of high technology
were present in Malaysia. However, most of them were in the hands
of multi- nationals rather than Malaysian-owned companies.
	   Both MIGHT and the Government wanted to encourage
Malaysian-owned companies to be more involved in high end and high
technology products.
	   ``Thus far, our achievement has been satisfactory but we need to
improve.''
	   Abdul Halim said over the years, Malaysia had made substantial
progress in trying to develop high technology, but more work needed
to be done.
	   ``The role of MIGHT is important to bring firstly; high
technology from overseas to Malaysia and, secondly, to develop high
technology locally through support at research institutions,'' he
said. ``To achieve this, MIGHT brings together the private sector
and the Government.''
	   Earlier, Abdul Halim launched the Malaysian High Tech Directory
(MHTD), a product of MIGHT, which can be found at
www.primenet.com.my on the world wide web.
	   MHTD is developed and managed by Perkhidmatan Rundingan Industri
Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of MIGHT.
	   The site is a gateway to technological information where
companies will be able to create links with business partners,
obtain information on high technology and source for business
opportunities.
	   Its aim is to assist investors and financial institutions to
search and identify the technology developers and suppliers and
identify companies able to go for Mesdaq (Malaysian Exchange of
Securities Dealings and Automated Quotations) listing.
	   Also present were MIGHT chief executive officer Dr Ahmed Tasir
Lope Pihie, MIGHT senior general manager Adznir Mokhtar and SME
Aerospace Sdn Bhd general manager Mustapha Said.

Japanese military chief visits Far Eastern port

exercises.  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The navies of Russia, Japan and the United States
could in the future hold joint rescue and salvage exercises, the
chairman of Japan's Joint Chiefs of Staff predicted Friday.
	   Adm. Kazuya Natsukawa spoke in the Far Eastern port of
Vladivostok, the main base of Russia's Pacific Fleet and the last
stop on his eight-day trip to boost military cooperation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto pledged last fall to increase military contacts as part
of effort to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
	   Natsukawa said plans are already in the works for the first
Russian-Japanese naval exercises, to be held in July. The Russian
and U.S. navies have previously held joint exercises, and Natsukawa
predicted the three countries could train together some time, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   In Vladivostok, Natsukawa was to meet with regional officials
and visit the Admiral Vinogradov anti-submarine ship. On Saturday,
he is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Pacific Fleet Combat Glory
memorial to Russian victims of two wars fought against Japan this
century.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of a dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of the war.
	   Natsukawa is scheduled to return to Japan on Sunday.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Soeharto's obsession with political stability is
reflected in the current laws on politics.
	   The result is an array of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) decrees and legislation tailored to maintain political
stability, but failing to abide by the people's sovereignty.
	   These legal instruments, while serving their master well, had an
adverse effect on political attitude, structure and culture. With
the lapse of time, the bureaucratic authoritarian regime became
increasingly stronger and democratic institutions not only lost
their function but also changed their roles to complement the
regime's power.
	   Now that Soeharto has resigned, the pressure for democratic
reform has become stronger. Such a change has become a historical
necessity.
	   In this context it is absolutely necessary to have legal reform
with the following priorities:
	   First, the revocation or at least a review of a number of MPR
decrees of which the spirit and the contents are contrary to the
objectives of democratic reform.
	   Apart from the necessity to change MPR decrees, the revocation
of a number of MPR decrees is also required.
	   For example, MPR decree No. III/1998 on general elections needs
to be renewed immediately. By doing so we can accomplish a number
of things, including clearly determine the function of democratic
elections, organizers and supervisors, and recognize monitoring
agencies and expand the number of political parties.
	   Also, the number of appointed MPR members as well as House of
Representatives members can be put at a minimum, like for example,
10 percent of a total of 1,000 members.
	   Second, the enactment of a number of basic laws enshrining
articles of the 1945 Constitution for a reference to the making of
laws for political and economic democratization.
	   There is a need to make more enlightening basic laws on the
freedom to associate, to assemble and of expression based on the
Constitution as a basis to enact new laws on political parties,
mass organizations, NGOs, general elections, the press,
broadcasting.
	   As a juridical reference for economic democratization, there is
a need to elaborate Article 33 of the Constitution as a basis for
the making of a number of laws, like on antimonopoly, cooperatives,
the protection of small-scale businesses and others.
	   Third, the revocation of a number of legislative products which
have become tools of repression and restrict the freedom to
associate, assemble and of expression, like Law No.11/PNPS/1963 on
subversion, Law No.5/PNPS/1963 on political activities and various
articles of the penal code like the articles on antigovernment
offenses (haatzaai artikelen).
	   No less important is the revocation of a number of presidential
decrees made on the basis of the President's extra-constitutional
power, like the presidential decree on the establishment of the
Agency for the Coordination of Support for the Development of
National Stability (Bakorstanas), an extrajudicial institution that
plays a very decisive role in political life and security approach
implementation.
	   Fourth, the establishment of basic laws on state institutions,
which are the basis for the law on the composition and position of
the MPR/DPR, the law on the presidential institution (that
regulates the president's domain of authority and accountability,
also term of office) and others.
	   Fifth, the making of new laws to ratify a number of
international instruments with a high level of universality
(already ratified by more than 100 countries) like, among others,
the antitorture convention.
	   The MPR extraordinary session to be held either at the end of
this year or early next year, should also ask for Soeharto's
accountability in addition to revoking the two MPR decrees on the
former president and the former vice president.
	   Another priority to be tackled by the extraordinary session
should be the establishment of the principles for the
implementation of Article 28 of the Constitution as a basis for
political development, and at the same time a revision of the 1998
State Policy Guidelines.
	   The writer is a lecturer at the School of Sociopolitical
Science, University of Indonesia, and secretary-general of the
Independent Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP).

	   KOTA BARU, Thurs. - Mara has allocated an additional RM632.1
million to sponsor 62,238 students, including 27,000 new ones, at
higher learning institutions this year.
	   Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said the
increased allocation was to meet the growing number of students
obtaining places at the universities.
	   He said Mara allocated RM542.4 million in study loans last year
and RM492.9 million the previous year.
	   He said all the 27,000 new students would be pursuing
matriculation, diploma and degree courses in local institutions.
	   ``Mara is still sponsoring 3,318 students overseas and they are
expected to complete their studies in the next one or two months,''
he said.
	   He said that for the 1998-1999 academic session, Mara would
sponsor 10,246 students pursuing matriculation courses, of whom
7,946 would be placed at 32 private institutions while 2,300 others
at four Mara colleges in Banting in Selangor, Seremban in Negri
Sembilan and Kulim and Kuala Nerang, both in Kedah.
	   He also said Mara would provide full sponsorship including
tuition fees and living allowances for students from families whose
taxable income was less than RM50,000.
	   For students whose families earn a taxable income of between
RM50,001 and RM80,000, Mara will only pay for their tuition fees.
	   ``The loan application forms will be distributed to the students
by next week,'' he told a Press conference at the State Mara office
today.

	   KLANG, Thurs. - All food handlers in school hostels and canteens
in Selangor have been directed to undergo medical examinations and
attend training courses following increasing cases of food
poisoning among students.
	   The medical examinations and courses will be conducted by
institutions accredited to the Health Ministry.
	   The directive was given by the Selangor Health Department
following several cases of pupils in primary and secondary schools
in the State, especially in Klang, suffering from food poisoning.
	   The incidents occurred after the pupils ate food served in
hostel and school canteens last year and this year.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A fresh deal on restructuring the country's US$80
billion private-sector debt brought fresh hope to Indonesia's
battered financial market yesterday.
	   Securities dealers said that share prices, which had been under
strong selling pressure over the past several days, had a rare
increase, pushing up the main price index to close 3.5 percent
higher.
	   The rupiah, which opened at 11,600 per U.S. dollar, rose to
close at 11,500, a slight increase from the previous day's 11,700.
	   A dealer with a joint venture bank said, however, that positive
news on the private sectors' debt rollover plan had not
significantly improved market sentiment in the currency market as
some market operators remained edgy over the country's
deteriorating political and economic situation.
	   ``The fresh deal on private debt should have seen the rupiah
strengthen, but economic and political uncertainties barred it,''
he said.
	   Dealers said the rollover plan on Indonesia's overwhelming
corporate debt was crucial to pulling the country out of its
economic doldrums and restoring investor confidence in Indonesia's
hammered economy.
	   ``The debt talk deal, along with the release of the IMF loan,
should bring the rupiah to the 9,000 level against the dollar,'' a
dealer with a local private bank said.
	   Indonesia and creditor banks agreed yesterday to extend
repayment of private-sector corporate debt by up to eight years
with a grace period of three years.
	   Germany's Deutsche Bank said the main points of a framework debt
deal had been agreed upon. Corporate and bank foreign liabilities
would be regulated and trade finance would be maintained, throwing
a lifeline to Indonesia's struggling exporters.
	   Taking the mild lead of the rupiah, stock prices on the JSX
followed suit with the benchmark price index rising 3.5 percent or
13.72 points to 406.32 points on a total turnover of 436.28 million
shares worth Rp 481.03 billion ($43.73 million).
	   Stock analysts attributed the increase in the main price index
to positive market response to a fresh agreement on private debt
talks in Frankfurt.
	   ``It is positive and it should improve investors' sentiment in
the country's battered market,'' said the head of research of
Vickers Ballas Tamara Securities, Noraya Soewarno.
	   She said the decline in the rupiah's value by almost 80 percent
since July last year had caused the value of the country's overseas
private-sector debt to skyrocket and had forced the country to the
brink of collapse.
	   ``But talks on debt restructuring really is like getting fresh
blood,'' she said.
	   Stock brokers said trading activities on the local bourse, which
has declined over the past eight days, were buoyant as some
investors bought back debt-ridden blue-chips stocks in anticipation
of the debt talk deal.
	   ``Trading activities on the market were exuberant,'' a broker
with Mashill Jaya Securities said.
	   He said most local investors were euphoric over the debt talk
deal in Frankfurt. They responded by placing large buying orders on
stocks which had been under selling pressure over the past few
weeks. They bought shares in automaker Astra International,
Indofood Sukses Makmur, Bimantara Citra, Citra Marga Nusaphala
Persada, Tjiwi Kimia, HM Sampoerna, Gudang Garam.
	   The stock prices of Astra International rose Rp 300 to Rp 900 on
a total turnover of 64.09 million shares. Noodle-maker Indofood
Sukses Makmur rose Rp 500 to Rp 1,575 on 73.74 million shares,
Bimantara Citra rose Rp 25 to Rp 375 on 5.56 shares and Citra Marga
Nusaphala Persada climbed Rp 25 to Rp 375 on 3.89 million shares.
	   But an analyst with a local securities firm said the increase in
the main price index did not necessarily reflect the return of
foreign investors' confidence in the country's pummeled market.
	   ``It is just a market euphoric response because the country
still has to address other economic and political problems,'' he
said, pointing out that the country's political risk remained high
for foreign fund managers.
	   ``Since the political risk is still high, foreign fund managers
are reluctant to place their funds here,''he said. (aly)

	   KOTA KINABALU, Thurs. - State Umno and Barisan Nasional leaders
have described as ``appropriate'' the decision to appoint Land and
Co-operative Development Minister Datuk Osu Sukam as State Deputy
Chief Minister and Finance Minister.
	   Former Chief Minister Datuk Salleh Tun Said said Osu was the
right person to fill the post by virtue of his position as Sabah
Umno liaison committee chief. Salleh, who was Sabah Chief Minister
between December 1994 and May 1996, said Osu had the experience to
manage the Finance Ministry well.
	   ``He will be an asset to the State Government and I have no
doubt that he will get the full support of all members and
supporters of the State BN,''
	   added Salleh, who is an Umno supreme council member and Kota
Belud MP.
	   The posts of Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister were
left vacant following Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh's decision to opt
out of the State Cabinet under new Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard
Dompok.
	   Sabah Umno Youth chief Jema Khan said it was unprecedented for a
Federal Minister to give up his post and take up a State post.
	   ``I admire his courage.''
	   As the leader of Sabah Umno, Jema said, Osu hadcommitted members
of the party in the State to weather the challenges ahead with his
confidence.
	   Sabah Umno secretary Datuk Yahya Hussein said Osu's appointment
was timely as the State election would be held within the next nine
months.
	   Yahya, who is Communication and Works Minister, said Osu would
be in a better position to strengthen the State BN.
	   Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat Bersatu (Akar Bersatu) president Datuk
Pandikar Amin Mulia said: ``With his vast experience as a Federal
Minister, Osu would be able to contribute positively and improve
the effectiveness of the State administration,'' he said.

	   LOANS and scholarships under the Public Services Department
(PSD) will decrease this year, its director general Tan Sri Dr
Mazlan Ahmad said yesterday. He said that the department is
currently studing the matter and will come up with the result
later. He however decline to say when the results of the study will
be made available. ``The current cost of keeping students in
universities is increasing substantially. Therefore, we do not
expect to come up with many scholarships this year,'' he said. The
high cost of sponsoring students is due to the depreciation of the
ringgit.
	   Mazlan spoke to reporters after attending a briefing at MIGHT
and the launching of the Malaysian High Tech Directory by Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Halim Ali said yesterday.

	   A RECENT Press report highlighted a situation where the opening
of an ``unlicensed'' food and entertainment outlet in Penang was
graced by no less than one Deputy Minister and three State
executive councillors.
	   Only the VIPs know the rationale for choosing to be present at
the occasion though they were informed of its status by the Penang
Island Municipal Council before the event.
	   Certainly, this is not the only outlet in Penang which is
operating without a licence. No less than 20 other food and
entertainment establishments in Georgetown are prospering despite
being unlicensed.
	   The real issue appears to be the State's near-impotency in
regulating and controlling the activities of such places of
entertainment. It has no authority to close down an illegal
entertainment outlet.
	   The best the authorities can do is to mount ``harassment''
action against the operators and impose fines.
	   The good news, however, is that the ``Viagra'' for this malady,
in the form of The Entertainment and Places of Entertainment Bill
1997, is on the cards, although like the super-drug which has been
hailed as the miracle cure for male sexual impotency, its promises
have yet to be fully tested.
	   More powers are to be given to the authorities to control
entertainment activities under the new enactment which will replace
the obsolete Theatres and Places of Public Amusement Enactment
1958.
	   The Bill was tabled by Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon at
the previous meeting of the Penang State Assembly last December. It
is expected to become law at the current meeting.
	   Indeed, the would-be law promises to be a ``Viagra'' for the
authorities as it will for the first time give them power to close
down any entertainment outlet found in contravention of the
regulations or in breach of licencing conditions.
	   It also seeks to provide heavier penalties for offences
committed against the proposed enactment, including imprisonment
for up to five years, fines of up to RM50,000 as well as seizure
and forefeiture of documents and equipment.
	   This will certainly be an improvement, given the weaknesses of
the outdated 1958 Enactment which did not give authorities the
power to close down unlicensed entertainment outlets.
	   Moreover, the penalties provided for by the 1958 enactment are
paltry, with a maximum fine of RM500, and no provisions for
imprisonment or for the authorities to seize anything.
	   Although the basic features of the 1958 enactment have been
retained, the Bill defines in greater detail the activities to be
controlled and seeks to confer upon authorised officers the powers
of enforcement previously given only to police officers.
	   Under the proposed enactment, any person found providing
entertainment without a valid licence or at a place which does not
have a licence to provide entertainment will be liable to a fine of
up to RM20,000 or up to three years jail, or both, for a first time
offender.
	   For second or subsequent convictions, the offender will be
liable to a fine of up to RM50,000 or to imprisonment for up to
five years, or both.
	   Under the proposed enactment, entertainment includes beauty
contests and displays in which living persons take part; exhibition
of models, exhibition of films, video movies and puppet shows;
pin-table, billards, snooker and video games; competitions of games
of skill or chance; machines and devices which give players a
chance to obtain prizes in money or kind.
	   Authorised police and enforcement officers will also have the
right to enter and conduct investigations at these places without a
warrant.
	   The Bill provides for certain offences to be compoundable at a
sum of up to half the stipulated fines, and forfeiture of documents
and items even if there is no prosecution for the offence.
	   Where an offence is committed by a body of persons, whether
corporate or not, any person responsble for its management, be it a
director or manager, shall be deemed guilty of the offence unless
he proves that it was committed without his consent, knowledge or
connivance, or that he had exercised diligence to prevent its
commission.
	   The real test as to the effect of this Bill is, however, in its
implementation and enforcement once it becomes law.
	   Will it be used to its full potential without fear or favour, or
will it become a ``nuclear bomb'' which some corrupt licensing or
enforcement official can use to threaten the operators for bigger
bribes?
	   An indication will probably be available from what happens,
whether unlicensed outlets are closed down, still prosper or
suddenly turn legitimate.

  Eds: ADDS items on death of referee Dienst; Laudrup-Schmeichel;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gottfried Dienst, who controversially awarded
England's third goal in the 1966 World Cup final with the Germans
protesting the ball hadn't crossed the line, has died after a short
illness.
	   The Swiss referee's decision became part of World Cup history
when Geoff Hurst's injury-time shot hit the underside of the
crossbar, bounced down and out into play.
	   English players celebrated a goal and the Germans ran to
linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest. Dienst ran to the linesman
too, awarded the goal, England then led 3-2 and finally won 4-2.
	   ___  
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ For two of Denmark's top players,
Friday's friendly against Cameroon had something special: Michael
Laudrup said farewell to his fans at home after 16 years on the
team and Peter Schmeichel marked his 100th game in goal.
	   Laudrup, who also played on Denmark's 1986 World Cup side in
Mexico, announced in May he will retire from soccer at age 33 after
the World Cup finals.
	   Cheered by some 37,000 fans at the national Parken stadium in
Copenhagen, a visibly moved Laudrup, making his 98th appearance,
kicked off his last game on Danish soil while supporters chanted
``Michael, Michael.''
	   His professional career took him to European powerhouses like
Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Ajax Amsterdam.
	   One of the world's top keepers, Manchester United's Schmeichel
is the second Dane to reach the magic figure. Of the 100 games, he
has managed to keep the ball out of the net 46 times.
	   Schmeichel and Laudrup likely will beat former international
Morten Olsen's record of 102 games as both been selected for the
World Cup.
	   ___  
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Like a fighter who's been knocked out
in the first round seven times in a row, Scotland's soccer team
will celebrate if they finally reach round two of the World Cup.
	   ``We have a great chance to make history, and the boys know
that. We have got to dispel the notion of being brave losers,''
coach Craig Brown said Friday as the team departed for France ahead
of the June 10 opening game against defending titlist Brazil.
	   ``We will really be at the highest level,'' he added. ``We are
one of 30 teams who have qualified to join the hosts and holders.
	   ``There are some 142 countries who have not made it, like
Portugal and Sweden. We are there and viewed as one of the
underdogs, which is fine by us.''
	   ___  
	   MONTREAL, Canada (AP) _ Formula One star David Coulthard is
likely to be the only driver who hopes next Wednesday's testing at
Silverstone is rained off.
	   The McLaren driver has a ticket for the World Cup opener between
Brazil and his native Scotland.
	   ``I have been exploring all the options to see how I can get
there,'' said Coulthard, who is in Montreal for Sunday's Canadian
Grand Prix.
	   ``I have a group of friends who are going and they have got the
tickets, but the problem is we are testing next week. We were due
to test at Magny-Cours in France which would have made it easier.
	   ``But it has been switched to Silverstone,'' Coulthard said.
``All I can hope now is that the test that day is called off
because of rain.''
	   ___  
	   WEST BROMWICH, England (AP) _ Lawyer Jonathan Finn has quit his
job to spend a month in France watching the World Cup.
	   The 32-year-old fan has gained tickets to 20 World Cup games and
can't wait to get to the World Cup.
	   ``The wine, the food, the culture, the scenery, the atmosphere
among visiting supporters, the football itself - it was just all
too much to miss,'' said Finn, who supports division one West
Bromwich Albion.
	   He managed to get hold of so many tickets after a friend had the
brainwave to ring the ticket-line at 3 pm on Saturdays, while the
lines were quiet because English fans were at matches.

	   IF Spice has always been part of your musical diet, then you
would probably be totally devastated by the recent news that Ginger
is no longer an ingredient.
	   Yes, saucy Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) has left the girls and
keen observers feel that like a chair with a broken leg, the
popular Spice Girls will crumble with the departure of a vital
memer.
	   Reports of strife in the band, famed for hits like Wannabe and
Spice Up Your World, surfaced after Halliwell failed to appear with
the group at the televised National Lottery Draw. The former model
and Turkish quiz show host also missed concerts in Oslo, Norway.
	   The official line was that Halliwell had suffered a bout of
stomach pain and was recuperating. But in a statement read Sunday
by lawyer Julian Turton, the 25-year-old Halliwell said: ``Sadly, I
would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls.''
	   But Ginger nonetheless wishes the group success and has hinted
that she ``will be back'' (whatever that means!).
	   While on the subject of farewells, fans of Innuendo should keep
their fingers crossed that singer Sam will not leave the group
after all.
	   Although talk about a split surfaced some time ago, the group is
reportedly ironing out their differences amicably, like true
professionals. Well done, guys! Innuendo, which grabbed six awards
at this year's AIM awards, have just had their album remixed. On
top of that, it's been confirmed that their debut album will be
released in six European countries - Norway, Denmark, Finland,
Sweden, Britain and Holland.
	   Said Ahmad Izham, the managing director of their recording
company Positive Tone: ``Yes, the agreement has been signed and
sealed. Finally their album is going places. Their remix album,
which will be released locally next month, will have a couple of
dance remixes while the rest are RB remixes.
	   ``All in all, we will have 10 remix numbers which were
originally done by a few up-and-coming rhythm and blues producers
namely Illegal, G-Soul, Paul Moss, Audimok and Hari.''
	   Among the tracks are Belaian Jiwa, Selamanya, Just For You, Tell
Me, etc.
	   Positive Tone's other artistes like Poetic Ammo will also find
their albums on the racks in Britain soon.
	   OAG has already released their single, Name Of The Game in
Germany, Austria, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.
	   The group which has really lost one member is all-girl outfit,
Elite.
	   It's been two months since Abby said sayonara. She was rumoured
to have some personal problems.
	   While Elite is toying with the idea of getting a replacement,
their album sales have not been a slap in the face. Some 25,000
copies have been snapped up - not bad considering the economic
climate.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The skies ranged from clear over western and northern Puerto
Rico to partly cloudy elsewhere including the Virgin Islands. The
wind was calm or light from the southeast. The temperatures ranged
from 74 to 81 degrees. The Doppler radar detected isolated rain
showers over the Atlantic Ocean but scattered to numerous showers
and isolated thunderstorms over the Caribbean Sea and southern U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   A trough of low pressure was located this morning over the
Caribbean Sea south of Puerto Rico and then east northeast to the
Leeward Islands. At the same time an upper-level trough was located
across the Dominican Republic east across Puerto Rico to the Virgin
Islands. This trough is stationary now but is expected to move
south to the Caribbean Sea Saturday afternoon. Once this begins a
drier and less unstable air mass will move into the region from the
north. This will greatly reduce the potential for showers and
afternoon thunderstorms Saturday through Tuesday.
	   The marine conditions are very good for any kind of marine
activity and should remain very good through the whole weekend.

USOC chief doesn't rule out 2008 bid
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN WILSON  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The race for the 2008 Summer Olympics is
suddenly getting crowded. And the United States, which has been
concentrating on a bid for 2012, is not ruling out jumping into the
2008 fray.
	   The candidates so far include Toronto; Osaka, Japan; Istanbul,
Turkey; Seville, Spain, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Paris, Rio de
Janeiro and China are among others weighing possible bids.
	   Officially, the race hasn't even begun yet. The International
Olympic Committee won't open the bidding process until next year,
and the selection of the host city will take place in 2001.
	   But this week's meeting of the Association of National Olympic
Committees in Seville provided an early glimpse into the campaign.
	   Bid officials from Osaka and Toronto were busy lobbying
delegates, and Seville used the occasion to announce and promote
its candidacy.
	   The activity did not go unnoticed by U.S. Olympic Committee
president William Hybl.
	   The USOC decided last year not to pursue a 2008 candidacy,
saying it had little chance of winning so soon after summer games
in Atlanta in 1996 and winter games in Salt Lake City in 2002.
	   The USOC elected instead to bid for the 2012 games. Nine
American candidates are seeking to become the USOC's choice: Los
Angeles; Arlington, Texas; Tampa, Fla.; Cincinnati; Houston; New
York; San Francisco; Seattle, and a joint bid from Baltimore and
Washington.
	   But the recent entry of Toronto into the 2008 race has changed
the landscape. If Toronto gets the games, a U.S. city would have
virtually no chance in 2012 because the International Olympic
Committee would be reluctant to return to North America so soon.
	   For that reason, Hybl leaves open the possibility of a U.S. bid
for 2008.
	   ``We're committed for 2012 but the USOC continues to monitor
what options might be available in other years,'' he said. ``Right
now, we are concentrating on 2012.''
	   Hybl might have trouble winning support for a 2008 bid.
	   Among those staunchly opposed is Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice
president and member of the USOC's executive committee. DeFrantz
was among those who insisted the United States should not bid for
the 2008 games.
	   Asked the chances of a switch from 2012 to 2008, she said. ``I
think none.''
	   DeFrantz said the United States should stay out of the race,
regardless of Toronto's candidacy.
	   ``I don't believe a U.S. city could win under any circumstances
in 2008,'' she said.
	   DeFrantz said the USOC started the bidding process for 2012 too
early.
	   ``I felt very strongly we should have waited awhile,'' she said.
	   Also missing from the 2008 race is South Africa. Cape Town
mounted a strong bid for the 2004 games, finishing third in the
voting behind winner Athens and Rome.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, eager to take the games to
Africa for the first time, encouraged South Africa to bid again for
2008. But the country is now concentrating its efforts on bidding
for the 2006 World Cup.
	   ```It's most unlikely we will bid,'' said Sam Ramsamy, head of
the South African national Olympic committee. ``We felt we learned
a lot from the first bid. We need to assimilate the learning. Maybe
2012 will be more appropriate than 2008.''
	   Ramsamy said the decision was not related to the World Cup bid,
though he acknowledged that staging the soccer showpiece would be
simpler than holding the Olympics.
	   ``It's a proven fact that it's easier to organize one world
championship over one month than 28 world championships over 16
days,'' he said.

England 382 for six at tea
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with tea score  
  By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England gradually took control of the
first cricket test at Edgbaston Friday despite South Africa hitting
back with five wickets before tea.
	   The home side rallied around a brilliant 103 by former captain
Mike Atherton to progress to 382 for six at tea on the second day,
virtually shutting South Africa out.
	   Resuming the day at 249 for one, England lost Atherton without
any addition to the score and then built on a 60-run stand between
skipper Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain.
	   South African bowlers, culpable and costly on the first day,
were far more disciplined Friday and were rewarded with five
wickets in the first two sessions, including 3-29 in a 10-over
spell.
	   Left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams was the pick of South Africa's
bowlers, sending down 17 overs to claim Hussain (35) and Mark
Ealham (five) at the cost of 26 runs. He had outstanding figures of
3-73 from 35 overs.
	   An overcast day made run scoring difficult, especially against
Shaun Pollock. None of the batsmen could make much of the
ginger-haired medium paceman, who moved the bowled alarmingly.
	   Mark Ramprakash, who came of age as a test player during the
recent tour of the West Indies, held the middle-order together with
a resolute unbeaten 41 while Dominic Cork was 10 not out in 44
minutes.
	   After the loss of Atherton with the 10th delivery of the
morning, Stewart (49) and Hussain, further frustrated the South
African attack in a 93-minute stand.
	   But England's hopes of getting the third wicket pair to take
them to an imposing position took a crucial blow just before lunch.
	   In the space of five balls, Stewart and Hussain fell to Lance
Klusener and Adams.
	   Stewart, edged Klusener to Daryll Cullinan at first slip and
Adams trapped Hussain leg before wicket with a delivery that hardly
bounced.
	   Batting after lunch became increasingly difficult and Pollock
produced the ball of the match so far, uprooting Graham Thorpe's
middle stump with a swinging yorker. Left hander Thorpe was out for
five.
	   Ealham stayed at the wicket with Ramprakash for almost and added
27 runs, but an outstanding ball by Adams unsettled his stumps.
	   Ramprakash continued to blossom, four exquisitely timed
boundaries crowning his 115-ball innings that has lasted 136
minutes.
	   Fast bowler Allan Donald, who remained a doubtful starter on the
second day, took the field and had Atherton caught behind with his
fourth ball of his first over.
	   Atherton, having remained characteristically impassive on the

Antarctic Treaty nations agree on environmental rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The 26 countries that manage Antarctica
announced Friday that they settled key rules for protecting the
frozen continent's fragile environment.
	   Concern about increased human activity on the vast area
surrounding the South Pole was a main topic for the 22nd Antarctic
Consultative Meeting, in the northern city of Tromsoe.
	   ``Now we have in place a unique and comprehensive set of
regulations for an entire continent. This is important not in the
least because the global significance of the Antarctic has become
greater at the same time as pressure on its resources increases,''
Norwegian delegation leader Dagfinn Stenset was quoted as telling
the national news agency NTB.
	   Norwegian polar expert Arne Orheim was elected to as chairman of
the new environmental committee and said it already set up five
working groups to identify the threats to the Antarctic.
	   ``The most important working group will approve environmental
impact assessments for all projects of significant scope in the
Antarctic,'' he was quoted as telling NTB.
	   He said the committee will also present an environmental status
report for the region to the Antarctic Conference in 2000.
	   The meeting failed to agree on which nation would be the site of
its Antarctic secretariat, a problem that has lingered for decades.
	   Under the treaty, nations put aside territorial claims in the
Antarctic, and agreed to use it only for peaceful, nonmilitary
purposes.

Pantani stays ahead while Fagnini wins 20th Giro stage

<TEXT>
	   MENDRISIO, Switzerland (AP) _ Marco Pantani held onto his lead
in the Tour of Italy Friday while fellow Italian Gian Matteo
Fagnini clinched his first stage victory.
	   Close on Pantani's heels, one-minute, 28-seconds behind, is
Russia's Pavel Tonkov. The two rode together slightly behind the
lead pack Friday to save energy for Saturday's 34-kilometer
(21-mile) individual time trial.
	   Tonkov is expected to defeat Pantani, who is a climbing
specialist, in the time trial, and victory will come down to the
final seconds.
	   ``We are both already thinking of tomorrow's race which will be
decisive,'' Pantani said. ``I am sure Tonkov will do all he can to
win so it will be tough.''
	   The 22-stage Giro ends Sunday in Milan.
	   Fagnini won the day's stage -- 137 kilometer (85 miles) from
Boario Terme, Italy to Mendrisio, Switzerland -- in three-hours
31:29 minutes.
	   Pantani, 28, who was sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a
broken leg, took over the leader's pink jersey from Switzerland's
Alex Zuelle during a mountain stage Tuesday and has held onto it
ever since.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Desmond Tutu made one last bid on
Friday to extract an apology from apartheid's last hard line
president, ending a week of courtroom drama over ultimate
responsibility for atrocities under white rule.
	   The Nobel Laureate and retired Anglican archbishop who was for
decades the moral spokesman against apartheid asked former
President P.W. Botha to apologize for the bombings and killings
against black activists.
	   ``The government that he headed caused many of our people deep
deep anguish and suffering,'' Tutu said. ``Can he bring himself to
say he's sorry?''
	   Botha sat stonefaced during Tutu's speech, as he has during most
of the week that saw a simple contempt case turn into a moral
inquest. Since apartheid ended with the first democratic elections
in 1994, Botha has insisted he has nothing to apologize for.
	   Botha, 82, is charged with ignoring three subpoenas to appear
before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is probing
atrocities committed during white rule.
	   But the case has focused on allegations that Botha and the
shadowy State Security Council he headed coordinated a crackdown on
anti-apartheid activists and directly ordered bombings and killings
during the 1980s.
	   Grilling Tutu, who heads the Truth Commission, defense lawyer
Lappe Laubscher said there were no direct assassination orders in
any of the council's minutes, indicating the killings were the work
of ``bad apples'' in the police and army who misunderstood orders.
	   An angry Tutu objected.
	   ``How many bad apples are you going to concede?'' he asked.
``No, no. We cannot now say that these are bad apples. They are
people who were sitting on the State Security council.''
	   The case was adjourned until June 15, when both sides will
summarize their findings. Botha faces a hefty fine or even two
years in prison if found guilty.
	   Afterwards, Botha had an animated and angry conversation with
prosecutor Bruce Morrison out of hearing distance of reporters.
	   He then turned to reporters, citing three books they should read
to understand his point of view, including his biography, ``Voice
from the Wilderness.'' He refused further comment.
	   Prosecution witnesses, including police death squad commander
Eugene de Kock, testified earlier this week that the council's use
of phrases like eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' sanctioned the
murder of the white-run state's opponents.
	   Botha and other top members of the SSC claim the words meant
that opponents should be arrested.
	   Botha has been implicated by testimony elsewhere by top police
officials, who have claimed he gave direct orders for violent acts.
	   After Botha's 11 years as head of state, his successor,
President F.W. de Klerk, negotiated with the group that spearheaded
the anti-apartheid struggle, President Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress.
	   The talks culminated in the 1994 elections won by the ANC.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new prime minister claimed Friday that
the country had emerged from its economic crisis, but President
Boris Yeltsin warned that renewed stability depended on his
government's ability to collect taxes.
	   The country's new tax chief announced plans for a crackdown on
the country's 1,000 richest citizens, whose rapid accumulation of
wealth since the Soviet period has been largely unimpeded by
taxpaying.
	   ``Well-known people should be examples for other citizens,''
Boris Fyodorov told the Kommersant daily.
	   The government also ordered five large oil companies to pay
their tax debts by July 1 or face confiscation of their property,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russian financial markets collapsed late last month, and only
began to recover this week as rumors mounted of an emergency
bailout by the International Monetary Fund or the Group of Eight
industrial nations.
	   Top officials, including the new prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, have repeatedly said there was no ``official'' request
for such aid _ sometimes stressing the word ``official.'' At a
conference in Ukraine on Friday, Kiriyenko insisted the financial
crash was over.
	   ``We have stopped the crisis and reached a turning point,'' he
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But some Western investors said the markets had regained
strength only on the assumption that a bailout was imminent.
	   ``Russia needs an infusion of capital,'' said James Fenkner,
managing partner of CentreInvest Capital Management in Moscow. ``If
it gets a big bucket of money, everything will be OK.''
	   After regaining ground earlier in the week, stocks declined
slightly Friday on extremely thin trading, with most investors
lying low until next week.
	   Many investors believe a bailout package will be unveiled
Tuesday, when G-8 deputy finance ministers meet in Paris.
	   ``If nothing is announced in Paris, you are going to see a
little bit of panic here,'' said Alex Pitaleff, a trader at
Creditanstalt Investment Bank.
	   No one disagrees that Russia needs cash, but some Russian
officials have been insisting the country could get by with
commercial loans and an improvement in tax collection.
	   In a radio address, Yeltsin implored Russians to pay their
taxes. The government says fewer than 3 percent filed income tax
declarations last year.
	   ``The financial crisis threatens to destabilize the Russian
ruble,'' the president warned. ``And that means a return to rising
prices and a higher cost of living. That is something we simply
can't allow.''
	   ``The time has come to demand and punish, including filing
criminal charges,'' Yeltsin added. ``If we don't collect taxes, we
can't pay salaries.''
	   Yeltsin called on parliament and Russian regional governments to
trim their staffs to save money, and promised to shrink his own
staff by 30 percent.
	   Russia's top business tycoons, who met with Yeltsin earlier in
the week to discuss ways out of the crisis, issued a statement
saying they were ready to support ``all sensible steps'' to revive
the economy, ITAR-Tass reported.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Sempati Air's shareholders meeting scheduled
yesterday to decide the future of the ailing private airline was
canceled because many of the shareholders could not attend.
	   Sempati spokeswoman Rima Novianti said the new date for the
shareholders meeting had not been fixed. The airline is partly
owned by former president Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo ``Tommy''
Mandala Putra.
	   ``Many of our shareholders had not confirmed their presence as
of last night (Wednesday) while some others said that they could
not attend the meeting due to various reasons,'' Rima told The
Jakarta Post.
	   Sempati, founded in 1989, is owned by the Malaysian-Indonesian
joint venture Asian Aviation Inc. (40 percent), the Indonesian
Army's PT Tri Usaha Bhakti (Truba) (25 percent), the Humpuss Group,
controlled by Tommy (15 percent), and Soeharto's close friend
Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan (20 percent).
	   She said the company's shareholders were to meet yesterday to
discuss whether it should completely halt operations and resulting
actions to take on workers and fleets.
	   On Monday, Minister of Communications Giri Suseno Hadihardjono
said Sempati Air would stop operations as rising costs resulting
from the sharp drop in the rupiah against the U.S. dollar had eaten
up most the company's revenues.
	   Rima said Sempati's flight operations would be halted as of this
Saturday, but administration service would remain to collect
proceeds from agents until the end of June.
	   ``After that we don't know what to do. It depends on the
shareholders meeting,'' she said.
	   She said that a sharp plunge in the value of the rupiah against
the U.S dollar had caused serious turbulence for Sempati since 80
percent of its operating costs were in dollars, including for lease
payments, spare parts purchases and airport service.
	   Rima said Sempati operated a fleet of 25 leased aircraft and
employed 3,500 workers at its peak in 1996, a time when it was
labeled the country's largest private air carrier.
	   Currently, it uses five Boeing 737 aircraft and has about 700
employees. It had slashed its former service to 31 international
and domestic destinations to just seven domestic domestic
destinations.
	   The five other scheduled air carriers are state owned Garuda
Airlines, Garuda's subsidiary Merpati Nusantara, Bouraq Airlines,
Mandala Airlines and Dirgantara Air Service.
	   Except for Dirgantara, which only operates its own aircraft, the
carriers lease many of their aircraft. (gis)

	   THE economy can be a drag but it's no reason to stop ``jazzing''
on. Up for grubz is a snazzy little outlet located at the basement
of Wisma UOA in Damansara Heights.
	   Remember All That Jazz? Well, this new place called, well, Grubz
is something like that but better. An eatery by day, it transforms
into a comfy lounge by night.
	   So what's cooking?
	   You'll be pleased to know that by night a group of well-known
musicians take to the stage to brew up some real jazzy stuff.
	   We're talking heavyweights the likes of Michael Veerapen on
piano, guitarman Josie Thomas, Zahid Ahmad on drums, Jimmy on
saxophone and new addition (but by no means amateurish) Brian
Benson on bass.
	   And it does get better. You simply, or rather must(!!!) drop by
to listen to the sultry voice of Kelly Salcedo from the
Philippines. Boy, this lady sure can sing! A cross between Whitney
Houston and Diana Ross, look out for her acrobatic, remarkably
controlled voice serving up an array of jazz numbers, from Mac The
Knife to Man In The Mirror.
	   Oh yes, make sure you sit at the right places. There are three
``sections'' there; one for avid, hard-core listeners, the other
for those who like to have a quiet chat, and the bar for
``downpours''.
	   Grubz is open daily from Monday to Saturday. It is closed on
Sunday.
	   There is no ``live'' band on Mondays but in the pipeline is
``Jazz Tasting'', a one-off thingy specially tailored for student
band members with talent and without an avenue to showcase it.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Ministry of Industry and Trade said yesterday
it would speed up the allocation of new export quotas for textile
and textile products.
	   The ministry's export director, Sudar, said yesterday the early
allocation of new quotas was aimed at grasping market opportunities
from rival countries.
	   The ministry would monitor the supplies of certain products in
competing countries and, when supply was running low, the ministry
would allocate a quota for the category of goods for local
exporters, he said.
	   This might lead international buyers to find products, which are
running out in other countries, in Indonesia, he added.
	   ``Even if certain quota categories were not usually allocated at
this time, we would do so if our competitors' supply of this
category was running out,'' he was quoted by Antara as saying.
	   Sudar said not all orders for textiles and textile products had
been canceled by international buyers, but last month's riots had
affected some orders.
	   Orders under contract have not been canceled, he said.
	   ``Orders for which no contract had been signed were the ones
that got canceled,'' he said.
	   Sudar said the country's exports of textile and textile products
in the first four months of this year reached US$911.09 million, up
9.58 percent compared to the same period last year of $831.46
million.
	   The United States was the biggest importer of Indonesian
textiles during the period, totaling at $503.32 million.
	   It was followed by the European Union with $388.55 million,
Canada $18.82 million and Norway $390,930.
	   Export volumes in this year's first quarter reached 556.73
million square meters, a 27.1 percent rise year-on-year from 438.02
million square meters.
	   The European Union exported the largest volume of textile and
textile products from the country, totaling 334.72 million square
meters.
	   The United States followed with total exports of 216.3 million
square meters, Canada 5.66 million square meters and Norway 38,920
square meters.
	   The number of categories of products exported to textile buyers
amount to 108, including 81 categories imported by the United
States, 14 categories by the European Union, 11 categories by
Canada and two categories by Norway. (das)

	   GUTHRIE Ropel Bhd sees the regional financial crisis as not only
contributing to the surge in crude palm oil (CPO) prices but it has
also presented the company with the opportunity to reflect on its

	   Abdul Khalid says in his annual statement the enhancement of
shareholders' value will continue to be vigorously pursued by way
of a three pronged three year medium term strategy.

millenium,'' Abdul Khalid says.
	   According to him, Guthrie Ropel's focus will be strengthening
its core competence of plantation of oil palm and rubber through
higher productivity and cost efficiency.
	   In addition, he notes that Guthrie Ropel will seek to expand its
plantation operation when the opportunity arises.
	   Meanwhile, Abdul Khalid says the relative expansion of oil palm
over rubber will continue to increase profitability.
	   ``Expanding on the group's other strength, the land banks which
are ready for development, the 1998 to 2000 period will see the
group preparing for the next upturn in the property market.''
	   ``At the end of 1997, a total of 626.53 ha of land have been
earmarked for property development.''
	   ``In the medium term, the work plan is to get these lands ready
for development through planning and conversion, to put high
quality management efforts in place, and to organise finance for
investment and development,'' Abdul Khalid says.
	   Guthrie Ropel posted a higher group pre-tax profit of RM54.69
million for the year ended December 31 1997 compared to RM49.67
million in 1996.
	   Turnover increased to RM131.41 million compared to RM124.62
million previously.
	   Profit after tax rose to RM44.40 million from RM35.78 million
previously.
	   Earnings per share moved up to 34.9 sen from to 28.2 sen
previously.
	   Abdul Khalid says the improved earnings were due to higher
profits from plantation as well as higher investment and interest
income.
	   Directors are recommending a special dividend of two sen per
share and a final dividend of 15 sen per share for the year just
ended.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, the
world's largest noodle maker, reported yesterday a 70 percent
decline in net profit in the first quarter this year from the same
period last year.
	   The figure of Rp 28.29 billion (US$2.57 million) was down from
Rp 97.36 billion.
	   The company attributed the decline to foreign exchange losses,
which soared to Rp 160.70 billion in the first three months this
year against Rp 10.95 billion in the corresponding period of 1997.
	   But the company said in a statement that its sales increased by
127 percent to Rp 1.76 trillion in the first quarter this year,
from Rp 778.20 billion last year.
	   The statement said the noodle business accounted for 35 percent
of its sales, edible oil and fats 23 percent, flour business 17
percent and snacks, baby foods, distribution, trading and others
contributed 25 percent to its sales. (aly)

	   EDMUND Yeoh, who took up the sport at the age of 14, is fully
focused on the Commonwealth Games, putting aside his studies at
least until after September.
	   His modest dream is a medal of any colour and he showed his
prowess at the recent Nauru Commonwealth Championships where he was
placed third.
	   Like his father, former Sea Games silver medallist William Yeo,
the younger Yeo has dominated the 83kg category in Malaysia for
seven years since 1991.

greatly.
	   ``I believe in hard training and I'm willing to sacrifice
whatever that is necessary to achieve my dream of winning a medal
in the Commonwealth Games,'' said Yeo.
	   ``I'm at times homesick for I would love to visit my hometown in
Kuching but that has to wait. It is impossible to leave the
training base for over a short time as we cannot afford to disrupt
the training programme.
	   ``But I try hard not to think of home.'' he said.
	   Yeo, who first competed in his first Junior National
championships in 1990 in Selangor, was called up for Commonwealth
Games training in 1996 and is now in Bukit Jalil.

World Cup: Brazilian players upset over promotional appearance
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MUELLO  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ With captain Dunga saying the
team needs ``more work and less partying,'' several Brazilian
players expressed outrage Friday that the World Cup squad cut short
a practice this week to attend a promotional event for Nike.
	   ``There's no question it fouled things up,'' Bebeto said. ``But
at least it's over. That was the last.''
	   Ronaldo, who along with the Brazilian team has a personal
sponsorship contract with the U.S. sportswear manufacturer, stopped
short of criticizing Nike but admitted that ``it would be better to
be training.''
	   The team stopped practice after an hour, leaving about 5 p.m. to
attend the inauguration of Nikepark. Training session normally last
two hours.
	   The 6,300-square-meter (70,000-square-foot) exhibition in the La
Defense section of Paris that has a one-third size field and
several skill stations.
	   The park is to be open for children 18 and under through July
12.
	   The players quickly filed out of the shortened practice late
Thursday. No interviews, press officer Nelson Borges told
reporters.
	   ``Orders from on high,'' he explained.
	   With traffic, the team didn't arrive until 6:45 p.m., made a
presentation of a replica World Cup Trophy to the park, answered
two questions from a throng of reporters and left within a half
hour.
	   Still, many team members and others associated with the team
were angered that Nike, which signed a 10-year deal in 1996 worth a
reported dlrs 200 million deal with the U.S. company, has such
influence over the training schedule.
	   Nike spokeswoman Lilian Bours said the company has discussed the
appearance of Brazil at the park for months and denied the company
imposed a schedule on the Brazilian team.
	   ``We accomodated the whole opening around their schedule,''
Bours said. ``They really wanted to come. They insisted they wanted
to come as a whole team, so we accomodated them around their
schedule.
	   ``Whenever the ending of the training session was. We do not
dictate their training schedule.''
	   The sponsorship deal, which also gives Nike the right to stage
five exhibition matches a year, has been criticized before.
	   Brazil played two matches in Asia in three days in August last
year, in Japan and South Korea, a tour that some criticized as
meaningless.
	   Tostao, a star on Brazil's 1970 World Cup champions, said that
Nike had a hand in the choice of Spain's Atletico Bilbao and tiny
Andorra as Brazil's sparring partners in its final warmup games for
the Cup. He called Thursday's media event ``absurd.''
	   ``The team isn't training enough, and it has to attend the
interests of a sponsor?'' he said. ``In my time the sponsor
supplied the jersey _ now it owns the schedule. It's a paradox. We
need sponsors, but we risk this problem of losing control.''
	   Rivelino, another star of the '70 Cup team, charged that the
Brazilian confederation (CBF) had sold out the team.
	   ``I'm totally against a team being at the mercy of a sponsor. A
partnership is fine, but it has to have limits,'' he said. ``We
must separate commercial interests and the World Cup, but it seems
the CBF is more interested in its sponsors than in the team. And if
they lose the Cup, who will want them?''
	   Coach Mario Zagallo downplayed the imposition but made it clear
he knew who's calling the shots.
	   ``If your boss pays you millions and millions of dollars to go
somewhere and you say no, what happens? He says bye-bye,'' Zagallo
said. ``When your boss says go, you go.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government is to invite international bidders
to buy part of the country's largest steel producer, PT Krakatau
Steel, next week, State Minister of the Empowerment of State
Enterprises Tanri Abeng said yesterday.
	   ``The competitive bidding process will be held next week after
we appoint the investment advisor tomorrow (today),'' he told
reporters following a meeting with Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   He said that the 10 foreign investment banks which would back up
the privatization of the country's 12 state-owned companies in the
1998/1999 fiscal year would be announced today.
	   The bidding process for Krakatau Steel would be handled by an
appointed investment bank which must have expertise in the steel
industry, he said.
	   He explained that after the investment bank selected the best
investor candidates for Krakatau Steel, a one-month due diligence
period, which would include technical and economic evaluations,
would be conducted. The company's management would be involved in
this process.
	   After that, another one-week evaluation process would be
undertaken to come up with an economic-technical recommendation
which would be handed over to the country's privatization team.
This is headed by Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision
and State Administrative Reforms Hartarto Sastrosoenarto.
	   Together with the Minister of Finance, Tanri is a member of the
privatization team.
	   ``The final decision is in the hands of Coordinating Minister
Hartarto,'' Tanri said, adding that Hartarto would consider all
issues, including the sociopolitical aspects of the deal.
	   He promised that the stratified privatization process would be
done in a transparent manner.
	   Tanri was strongly criticized by Krakatau's management early
this week about allegations that he had quietly made a deal with
the Netherlands-based Ispat International to sell 49 percent of
Krakatau's shares for the relatively low price of US$400 million.
	   The deal would have given Ispat a monopoly in the domestic steel
wire and rod industry.
	   Tanri denied the accusations, saying that it was not a final
deal.
	   He also said that the government would make sure the Krakatau
privatization deal would not create a monopoly in the steel wire
and rod market.
	   ``We will negotiate (with the potential investor),'' he said,
pointing out that to prevent a monopoly the government may handle
the marketing side.
	   Tanri also said that the nation would gain by selling a larger
stake of Krakatau because it would get a better price.
	   The 1998/1999 privatization program is expected to raise a total
of Rp 15 trillion (US$1.3 billion), mainly to support the state
budget which is heavily burdened by huge subsidy commitments caused
by the economic crisis. (rei)

	   THERE have been an increasing number of cases this season where
Premier League coaches and team officials confront match officials
for what they consider ``poor'' decisions.
	   But after learning of Kedah coach Fisol Razak's punishment meted
out by the FA of Malaysia's (FAM) Disciplinary Board yesterday,
most will likely think twice before acting rashly.
	   Fisol was yesterday suspended for three matches by the board for
his actions during the match against Pahang in Alor Star on May 26.
	   The board, chaired by Senator Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman,
found Fisol guilty of confronting referee Ishak Ghani after the
match at the Darulaman Stadium which ended in a 3-3 draw.
	   Also punished were assistant coach Azman Eusoff and assistant
manager Saaban Ismail who have each been suspended for two matches
for their action which also included confronting Ishak after the
match.
	   The suspensions mean the three will not be allowed to sit on the
Kedah bench when they are on suspension.
	   They will have to convey instructions from the terraces but will
be allowed to be with the team before and after the match and at
halftime.
	   Kedah FA were let off with a warning as the board felt they had
done adequately in providing security during and after the match.
	   That aspect probably saved Fisol and his colleagues from a
heavier punishment as had security personnel not been out in full
force, their actions could have caused severe damage.
	   The situation was already bad enough during the match where
players and officials approached Ishak after Pahang equalised for
the third time in the match.
	   That saw the Kedah fans rip out the bucket seats in the stadium
and throw them onto the track and playing area.
	   To make matters worse, the fans gathered outside the stadium and
continued to abuse Ishak and his assistants who needed police
escort out of the stadium area.
	   The board found the action of Fisol and his colleagues hard to
accept as there are proper avenues to lodge a complaint against
match officials.
	   Confronting them doesn't serve any purpose and Fisol's
suspension can't come at a worse time.
	   With Kedah staging a revival of sorts and closing the gap on
Premier One leaders Pahang, they need their coach and his assistant
on the bench, not sitting on the terrace with the supporters
serving a suspension.
	   Perhaps the suspension will help him from repeating his actions
in the future.
	   If it doesn't, stiffer punishment will await him.

German chancellor admonishes nuclear power operators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ESSEN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl sharply criticized
the German power industry Friday for covering up leaky nuclear
waste transports in a scandal uncovered last month.
	   Speaking at the 100th anniversary of Germany's largest power
company RWE in Essen, Kohl said that more than any other sector,
the nuclear power sector is dependent on the public trust.
	   ``That trust and the acceptance of this technology is
regretfully ... very much damaged,'' the chancellor said.
	   Last month, French and British authorities complained that
nuclear containers arriving at treatment plants from Germany were
emitting more radiation than permitted, renewing debate about the
industry's safety.
	   Kohl charged that nuclear power companies should have known how
sensitive the public is to nuclear power safety, but neglected to
report the deficiencies in waste transport. The shipments have been
suspended.
	   The chancellor stopped short of reading a prepared part of his
speech that said the nuclear power companies had severely damaged
Germany's image, but said he expected nuclear operators to fully
support a program developed by the evironment ministry aimed at
tighening security and reporting procedures on nuclear waste.
	   Friedel Neuber, RWE's supervisory board chairman, assured Kohl
that the company ``along with those responsible public officials
will take all measures to prevent a recurrence,'' of the safety
lapses.
	   While officials said the radiation posed no threat to people,
the issue sparked an election-year scandal for Kohl's government
and finger-pointing about who was to blame.

	   THERE is still a need to enhance usage of high technology among
Malaysians although the present level is satisfactory, Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Halim Ali said yesterday.
	   ``Over the years, we have made substantial progress in the area
of high technology. However, technology keeps on changing.
	   ``And to develop high technology locally, we need to bring
together the private sector as well as the Government,'' Halim said
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday after launching the Malaysian High-Tech
Directory.
	   Halim also stressed the important role played by the Malaysian
Industry- Government Group for High Technology (Might), a
non-profit company limited by guarantee.
	   Might is a smart partnership between the Government and private
sector working in synergy, prospecting primarily for business and
investment opportunities for industry, policy options for the
Government and research priorities for public and private sector
institutions.
	   Halim also attended a briefing by Might's chief executive Dr
Ahmed Tasir Lope Pihie, enabling him to understand the role and
responsibility of Might in the promotion of high technology.
	   When asked at what level of high tech the country is in, Halim
said that it is rather difficult to describe.
	   Meanwhile, Might co-chairman and Science Advisor to the
Government Tan Sri Dr Omar Abdul Rahman said high technology can be
divided into two aspects - the product and the process of making
the product.
	   ``Somethings the product itself is of high technology ...
sometimes the product may be of low technology but the process of
making the product, like garments for instance, is of high
technology.
	   ``Although the use of technology is satisfactory in Malaysia, we
want to push and encourage more Malaysian companies to go into high
technology,''
	   Dr Omar explained.
	   He added that for conventional companies and small- and
medium-scale industries, the usage of high tech is a major
constraint due to lack of human resource and capital.
	   The Malaysian High Tech Directory is a site on the worldwide web
that contains compilation of information on Malaysian high
technology companies, local high technoloy products and experts in
high technological areas.
	   The site is a product by Might, office of the Science Advisor
and the Prime Minister's Department. It is developed and managed by
Might's wholly owned subsidiary, the Perkhidmatan Rundingan
Industri Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
	   The site can be accessed through the internet at
www.primenet.com.my through Primenet - the Malaysian Technology
Hub.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government is to review the country's rice
import arrangements, including the overseas procurement contracts
signed by the State Logistics Agency (Bulog), in anticipation of a
declining supply in the international market.
	   Minister of Trade and Industry Rahardi Ramelan said that the
review was essential to make sure existing import deals would not
only rely on certain countries.
	   He pointed out that the query emerged because many of the
traditional rice-exporting countries had started to import
following the long drought induced by the El Nio weather
phenomenon. A substantial supply is likely to be available only in
China and Pakistan since only those two countries are expected to
have successful harvests this year.
	   ``We're studying these issues,'' he said, adding that the import
contracts which had been signed by Bulog would also have to be
reviewed to make sure that the suppliers had access to
international rice resources.
	   Bulog said earlier this week that Indonesia may have to import
up to 3.1 million tons of rice this year because domestic
procurement is expected to reach only 250,000 metric tons, the
lowest level in 20 years.
	   The agency said that rice stocks on May 28 stood at 2.5 million
tons, sufficient for just three months.
	   Several countries have pledged to provide the country's 202
million people with staple food. Japan pledged to supply 500,000
tons of rice in soft loans and 100,000 tons as a grant, Taiwan has
promised to sell 200,000 tons, China 250,000 tons and Vietnam
10,000 tons, while Thailand is to donate 5,000 tons.
	   Rahardi's comments seemed to contradict those of Bulog chief
Beddu Amang.
	   He said told a House of Representatives (DPR) briefing that the
world rice market has a surplus this year following higher
production in Thailand, Pakistan and India.
	   He predicted a 500,000-ton surplus that would make the worldwide
supply 21.5 million tons this year.
	   Trade financing
	   Indonesia is facing another serious problem in importing
essential food items including rice, sugar, wheat flour and
soybeans due to its letters of credit (L/Cs) problems and the
alarmingly low level of foreign exchange reserves.
	   Recent reports have said that Thai rice and sugar exporters are
not accepting Indonesia's L/Cs if they're not opened by state banks
and endorsed by foreign banks in Singapore.
	   The Singapore government has committed itself to guaranteeing a
total of US$3 billion in Indonesian L/Cs on the condition that the
International Monetary Fund disburses its bailout funding for
Indonesia.
	   The agency is expected to soon disburse another $1 billion in
bailout money to Jakarta; the funding was delayed due to the recent
political unrest.
	   Rahardi, however, said that he would renegotiate the terms
offered by Singapore because Indonesia is finding them hard to
implement.
	   ``Even though we're in a crisis, we should not take terms which
will be a disadvantage to us,'' he said, but declined to give
details.
	   He also said that similar renegotiating would also be done with
the 300 million deustchemark L/C guarantee offered by Germany.
	   More than $2 billion in L/C guarantees provided by the U.S.,
Japan, and Australia have also started to work.
	   Following the closing down of 16 private banks in November and
plunging confidence in the banking sector, overseas banks began to
reject Indonesian L/Cs. This caused a serious blow to the country's
ability to export non-oil and gas products.
	   Solving the trade financing problem is key to reviving the
export industry as it largely depends on imported raw materials,
Rahardi said.
	   He added that boosting exports was one of the government's main
priorities because it would provide foreign exchange that was badly
needed, especially for importing the five essential foodstuffs.
	   He also said that priority would be given to labor-intensive
export industries like garments and textiles.
	   Some economists have forecast that the country's economic crisis
will cause a 10 percent contraction in the economy and unemployment
of 20 million this year. (rei)

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - The Johor Race Series 1 at the Pasir Gudang
circuit over the weekend is expected to contribute an estimated
RM1.5 million to the local economy - a much needed amount in these
times of economic difficulties.
	   That is the figure the Johor Motor Club, the race organiser,
expects the competitors and spectators to spend over the two days
of the race, with the bulk of the money coming from the Hong Kong
party.
	   All because of the three special races - the Porsche Race, the
Ferrari Race and the Classic Car Race - with at least 40 of the
expensive vehicles shipped in from the former British colony.
	   There is also the entries from neighbouring Singapore with an
estimated 60 cars and 40 motorcycles entered for the 15 races -
five for motorcycles and 10 for cars.
	   A spokesman for the JMC yesterday confirmed that all the
vehicles from Hong Kong had arrived at the circuit, via the Pasir
Gudang port, a few days ago with a local forwarding company
handling all the shipping work.
	   ``Working on a rough estimated cost of RM5,000 to bring each car
from Hong Kong and back, that should cost a total of RM200,000 in
freight charges alone.
	   ``And there is also the hotel charges for the drivers,
mechanics, supporters...''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd, the
national asset management company, may need about RM25 billion to
take up the non- performing loans of the banking system.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim revealed this
estimate when he announced the guidelines for the AMC at the
Treasury today.
	   Anwar, who is also the Finance Minister, said the AMC would
initially raise RM10 billion via the issue of bonds locally and
abroad.
	   He said the equivalent of US$1 billion to US$2 billion (RM3.94
billion to RM7.88 billion) would be raised in the international
bond market by the AMC in the form of Government-guaranteed bonds.
	   The rest of the initial quantum will be raised in the domestic
market when liquidity improves.
	   Seed capital for the establishment of the AMC will be in the
form of a RM50 million grant from the Government, which will
initially hold the entire stake in the statutory company.
	   Eventually, local and foreign investors will be invited to take
up equity in the AMC - leaving the Government with only a minority
stake.
	   When asked about Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad's
statement in Tokyo that the Government will provide 60 per cent of
the funds required, Anwar said funding would be raised from all
sources.
	   ``The Government's equity may be substantially less than 60 or
40 per cent, but this will have to be looked into at a later
stage,'' he said.
	   On the AMC's operations, Anwar said two international firms -
Arthur Andersen and JP Morgan - had been appointed financial
advisers.
	   Anwar added a consortium of local banks had expressed interest
in taking up equity in the AMC.
	   But, they will be allowed to do so only later to prevent any
possibility of a conflict of interest during the AMC negotiations
to take over the NPLs.
	   Anwar also said the AMC's assistance to the banks would be only
in the form of taking over the NPLs. Any recapitalisation would
have to be done by the shareholders.
	   Asked if government institutions like the Employees' Provident
Fund and Khazanah Nasional Bhd would take up equity in the AMC,
Anwar said it was possible but no decision has yet been made.
	   The AMC chief executive officer and managing director, Azman
Yahya, said the appointment of another eight independent
non-executive directors to the board would be announced later.
	   It will be for the posts of chairman, three Malaysian directors,
two directors representing the international community and two
directors to represent the Government.
	   To facilitate the operations of the AMC, Anwar said legislation
pertaining to bankruptcy, foreclosure and taxation would be amended
and the amendements tabled in Parliament next month.
	   The AMC is expected to start operations by the end of July.
	   Further information will be posted on the Internet at
http://www.bnm.gov.my.

	   SERDANG, Thurs. - A high-quality organic fertiliser made from
local agricultural waste, chicken dung and sawdust may be marketed
this year following a memorandum of understanding signed today
between Mardi and Bio-Organic Systems and Services Sdn Bhd.
	   It is now being tested on fruits, vegetables, flowers and rice
by the Malaysian Agricultural and Research Development Institute.
	   Mardi director-general Datuk Dr Md Sharif Ahmad, said this today
after signing the MoU with BOSS president Paul Duane Jr.
	   Its Bio-Plus Activator, made up of 16 micro-organisms, is used
to transform agricultural compost into organic fertiliser. BOSS had
approached Mardi last year to test its products.
	   The first demonstration involved chicken dung, sawdust and burnt
rice husk.
	   The Bio-Plus Activator has been tested over the past 27 years by
Dr Eliseo L. Ruiz, a scientist from the Philippines and vice
president (technical) of BOSS.
	   ``The BPA has been used in the production of organic fertilisers
in the Philippines for the past 15 years,'' said Duane in his
address.
	   ``It will eliminate all foul smells within the first four days
of the biofermentation process. In comparison, organic compost made
by farmers is plagued with foul smell and flies.''
	   Duane announced that besides transferring the technology for
organic fertilisers and the BPA to Malaysia, BOSS hoped to develop
an export market for both products as well as an organic farming
facility in Malaysia, which would be the hub for Asia.
	   Based in Singapore, BOSS plans to expand to China and Malaysia.
	   Sharif said, ``The aim of today's MoU is to make Mardi's
research results commercially viable, something which has not been
possible in the past.
	   ``We hope that this organic fertiliser will reduce the volume of
inorganic fertilisers being used locally.''
	   Last year, Malaysia imported almost RM1.02 billion worth of
fertilisers.
	   Less than one per cent was organic.
	   Also signed at today's ceremony were three memorandums of
agreement between Mardi and Fasa Tuah Sdn Bhd, Deepa Sdn Bhd and
Projek Kayangan Sdn Bhd respectively.
	   They will enable Mardi to upscale its technology and conduct
pilot schemes involving medium-scale banana plantation, the
planting of sweet potato as a cover crop for replanted oil palm and
rubber plantations, and the processing of organic waste of oil palm
and coconut origin, for the horticultural industry.

	   PENANG, Thurs. - The State Government is preparing ``an action
plan'' to effectively resolve the problem of squatters and illegal
structures on Government land.
	   State Secretary Datuk Jamaluddin Ahmad Damanhuri had last month
instructed all the five district and land offices in Penang to
carry out a comprehensive study which will be used as the basis for
the plan.
	   Jamaluddin told the New Straits Times today that a circular was
sent to the northeast, southwest, Seberang Prai north, central and
southern districts to conduct the study immediately.
	   He said the study, expected to be ready in six months, would be
used as the basis by the State Government to resolve ``amicably and
tactfully'' the issue of illegal construction of housing
settlements and other structures such as houses of worship, shops
and hawker stalls on Government land.
	   The issue has taken on greater urgency following the Kampung
Rawa incident where brief skirmishes occurred between people of two
different faiths over the close proximity of a mosque and temple on
March 27 and the demolition of a temple on Government land in
Gelugor last week by the district office.
	   Jamaluddin said he had instructed all district offices not to
take drastic action against houses of worship on State land and to
prepare the reports first.
	   He said the State Government could not take immediate and
drastic action as it would only create social problems which would
eventually burden the Government.
	   Although the district and land offices had a ``preliminary
list'' of illegal structures on Government land, Jamaluddin said
the study was to provide an accurate list for a better picture of
the real situation.

	   PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad has given his
approval to the appointment of Land and Cooperative Development
Minister Datuk Osu Sukam as Sabah deputy chief minister and finance
minister, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said
yesterday.
	   Osu will take up the new appointment on Monday.
	   ``He (Osu Sukam) will resign from his present portfolio before
Monday,''
	   Anwar said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday at a press conference on
the Asset Management Co.
	   He was asked to comment on a news report on Osu's resignation as
a federal minister to enable him to join the Sabah Cabinet.
	   Anwar said Dr Mahathir, who is also Barisan Nasional (BN)
chairman, will decide on Osu's successor as land and cooperative
development minister.
	   ``It is the Prime Minister's prerogative to name the
successor.''
	   Bernama reports: Datuk Osu Sukam said he is returning to state
politics to strengthen the BN for the next election in Sabah.
	   ``This is what the party leadership wants after taking into
account what has happened and an important duty in the interests of
the party and Sabah,'' he said at his office at Wisma Tanah in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He said he will make full use of his 12 years' experience at the
federal level, including four as a Cabinet minister.
	   ``This is an invaluable experience and I will use it for the
interests of not only Umno but also BN and the people of Sabah.''

	   ROMPIN, Thurs. - Risda will be commercialising its cattle
ranching projects to cater to local demands for beef.
	   At present, demand for the meat is about 117,500 tonnes per year
and only 20 per cent of this is supplied locally. The remaining
94,000 tonnes have to be imported from countries like India and
Australia.
	   Risda chairman Datuk Abu Zahar Nika Ujang said the authority is
pioneering the use of techniques such as ranching and ``advanced
reproductive biotechnology'' in the country.
	   ``With the combination of ranching and ARB, which is used to
breed the cows in oil palm estates, we hope to produce enough to
meet demand and thus, reduce the import of beef,'' he said.
	   He said the cattle ranching was initially started in Risda
estates through its subsidiary Smallholders Estate Sdn Bhd (Espek)
in 1987 to control the growth of weeds and grass in the oil palm
estates.
	   To date, Risda has about 8,922 cows from the Kedah-Kelantan,
Brahman, and also Droughtmaster breeds, in 19 Risda oil palm
estates nationwide.
	   Abu Zahar was speaking to reporters after visiting the Ulu
Keratong oil palm estate yesterday.
	   Also present were Risda director general Datuk Nik Kamaruddin
Nik Kadir, Espek manager Yahya Ahmad and ARB specialist Dr Tengku
Azmi Tengku Ibrahim. ``The ranching system has been found to be
effective and the maintenance cost of estates has been reduced by
20 per cent. Furthermore, rearing of cows also generates extra
income to the estates through the sales of live cows and also
beef,'' he said.
	   Abu Zahar said the 187 cows bred through ARB, were being reared
in Risda oil palm estates in Terengganu Tengah, Terengganu and Ulu
Keratong. ARB is to be used on another 350 cows.
	   ARB, is the latest breeding technology by Mardi, which involves
estrus synchronisation, artificial insemination and embryo
transfer.
	   ``We have also included a long-term strategy to increase
commercial ranching activity to new areas under Risda which
includes mini-estates identified to be suitable to be integrated
with ranching,'' he said.
	   Risda, Abu Zahar added, would also be working together with the
Veterinary Department, Universiti Putra Malaysia and also Mardi to
boost ranching in oil palm estates.
	   ``Furthermore, Risda is also planning to venture into other
downstream activities such as slaughtering, processing meat
products and also marketing of such products within the next five
years.
	   ``Other plans also include production of cattle feed using palm
fronds which will be developed together with Mardi.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The High Court today recorded an
out-of-court settlement in a defamation suit by former Johor MIC
chairman Tan Sri G.
	   Pasamanickam against a New Straits Times journalist and three
others.
	   The consent judgment for the settlement was recorded before
judge Datin Paduka Rahmah Hussain.
	   Pasamanickam, who is MIC treasurer, had filed the action
claiming that he was defamed in an article titled ``13 Johor MIC
division heads stage walk out'' written by journalist Ravi Nambiar
in the New Straits Times on Aug 24, 1995.
	   Pasamanickam named Ravi, New Straits Times Sdn Bhd group editor
Datuk A.
	   Kadir Jasin, NST production and technical general manager Tun
Ibrahim Jafri and publisher New Straits Times Press (M) Sdn Bhd as
defendants.
	   In his statement of claim, Pasamanickam claimed the article
meant he had committed criminal breach of trust and was not fit to
hold any post and claimed for damages with interest and costs.
	   In their statement of defence, the defendants denied that the
article was defamatory and said it was fair comment and justified
statements.
	   The defendants had also stated that another article was
published on Aug 28, 1995, in which Pasamanickam was given an
opportunity to refute allegations contained in the first article.
	   Details of the settlement were not disclosed.
	   The case was first heard on March 16 when Pasamanickam gave
evidence.
	   Among others, he said he had not diverted any money into a
private scholarship fund as alleged in the article, adding that the
money was always deposited into an account of a fund set up by the
State MIC.
	   The court subsequently postponed the case to March 17.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Businessman Datuk Soh Chee Wen today
announced his resignation from all his political positions in the
MCA.
	   A statement faxed by his special assistant Lee Chai Huat said
that Soh had resigned as deputy chairman of MCA Selangor, chairman
of the Selangor Councillor Selection Committee and MCA divisional
chairman for Petaling Jaya Selatan. Soh confirmed that he had been
asked to submit his resignation by party president Datuk Seri Dr
Ling Liong Sik.
	   Lee, when contacted, said that the State Assemblyman for Subang
Jaya, Lee Hwa Beng, accompanied by MCA PJ Utara division deputy
chairman, Wong Leong, handed over Soh's resignation to a staff
member at Dr Ling's office at Wisma Perdana this afternoon.
	   When asked whether an interview could be arranged, Lee said, Soh
would not be giving any interview. Lee declined to give the reason
for Soh's resignation.
	   The New Straits Times learnt that Soh was not re-appointed after
the end of his one-year term as an appointed member of the
presidential council.
	   He was appointed a central committee member after the party's
last triennial election held in 1996. He has also resigned from the
post.
	   In mid-January this year, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange had
ordered all brokerages to report their exposure and information -
direct or indirect - to Soh. The information include the securities
transacted, the quantity of shares, value of exposure, identities
of related person or corporation, the relationship and name of
related nominee accounts.
	   Soh is currently the president and chief executive officer of
Promet Bhd, executive chairman of Uniphoenix Corporation Bhd,
executive director and chief executive officer of Plantation and
Development Bhd, and managing director of Kelanamas Bhd and
Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd.

	   THE Civil Court on Thursday accepted a lawsuit filed by 12
dissident Prachakorn Thai Party MPs calling for a denunciation of a
party resolution which endangered their memberships, one of the 12
said on Thursday.
	   Thanusak Lek-uthai said the group was also considering lodging a
complaint with the Constitutional Court to call for the
denunciation of the Civil Court's ruling if it does not favour his
group.
	   The group lodged the lawsuit in March calling for a ruling
against the Dec 29 resolution, an attempt by Prachakorn Thai leader
Samak Sundaravej to oust the 12 dissidents who supported the
Democrat-led government.
	   Last year's decision resolved that eight more members serve on
the 57-member executive board and that 11 others be appointed,
resulting in the pro-Samak faction outnumbering the 12 dissidents.
	   Thanusak also dismissed Samak's earlier remarks that the Civil
Court's ruling would use its own standard, saying the Prachkorn
Thai leader had attempted to pressure the court to rule against his
group.
	   Chalong Riewraeng, a dissident group member, expressed his
opposition to Samak's remarks on Wednesday when he compared his
group to a nail piercing the Prachakorn Thai leader's foot.
	   ''The nail has stayed put all along but it's the owner of the
foot that has harassed the nail and now been loudly complaining
about his foot being pierced,'' he said.
	   Chalong also said he and a few group members may set up a new
political party after the Democrat Party decided its executive
board would decide whether it would accept him and a few others,
despite an earlier invitation by Democrat secretary-general Sanan
Kachornprasart.
	   Man Pattanothai, a dissident member, said the other option was
to join a new party to be set up by former Palang Dharma Party
member Thaksin Shinawatra, or the Rassadorn Party or Labour Party
at the request of leader Chin Thapplee.
	   On Thursday evening a ceremony was held to introduce the new,
but as yet unnamed, political party of Thaksin Shinawatra, at his
residence off Soi Charan Sanitwong 69, which several leading
political figures attended.
	   Among them were former prime ministers Anand Panyarachun and
Banharn Silapa-archa, Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol
Sonakul, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and
Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban.

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - The National Unity and Social Development
Ministry will take disciplinary action against a welfare officer
alleged to have sexually abused two inmates at a welfare home here.
	   Minister Datin Zaleha Ismail said as the State Welfare
Department had already reported the matter to the police, the
Ministry would wait for the outcome of the investigations before
acting.
	   She said the Ministry viewed the case very seriously and would
take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
	   She welcomed the department's move to review the operations and
procedures at the five Government-run welfare institutions in the
State.
	   ``Whenever such cases occur, it is important that we do a review
to ascertain that whatever weaknesses in the system are immediately
identified and remedied.
	   ``In running our welfare homes which offer shelter for abused
children, women and other unfortunate people, we practise tight
security by imposing strict procedures.''
	   She added the movement of staff and visitors within the homes
was strictly monitored to ensure no untoward incidences occur
within the premises.
	   Speaking after closing a refresher course for Southern Region
Rukun Tetangga leaders, Zaleha said Rukun Tetangga centres in the
country had become very active now.
	   She said the 1,800 RT centres had last year carried out 17,355
social, educational, recreational and welfare activities.
	   She added with a total of 4.5 million RT members, the sector was
also being mobilised to assist in promoting programmes to help the
country's economic recovery.

Rwandan rebels kill four in attack on main highway
</HEADLINE>
  By HRVOJE HRANJSKI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TARE, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed four people, burned two
trucks and looted a local health center along the main highway in
northern Rwanda, witnesses said Friday.
	   The attack on midnight Thursday at Tare, 47 kilometers (25
miles) north of Kigali on the main road to northwestern Rwanda,
came a week after a shadowy rebel group warned of violence in areas
previously untouched by attackers.
	   Witnesses in Tare said a group of armed men ran shouting and
firing guns down the hills, surrounding houses and a restaurant
along the main road, before throwing petrol bombs at two parked
trucks.
	   The two drivers, who were apparently asleep inside, died
instantly. Another man was shot dead, and a local health worker
later died of gunshot wounds.
	   ``It lasted maybe 10 minutes,'' said Gerard Minigashura, a local
official. ``This is the first time they attacked here.''
	   Authorities in the capital, Kigali, were not available for
comment.
	   Last week, a rebel group calling itself People in Arms for the
Liberation of Rwanda warned of more attacks in a previously unknown
newspaper. Umucinguzi, or Savior, said the group was fighting the
Tutsi occupiers of Rwanda and their allies and urged Hutus to take
up arms.
	   PALIR was first heard of in June 1996 when it issued a
typewritten leaflet placing a bounty on the heads of Americans in
Rwanda.
	   Tutsi fighters took power in July 1994, ousting an extremist
Hutu government responsible for the genocide of more than 500,000
minority Tutsis.
	   Issue No. 4 of the Kinyarwanda language newspaper printed a map
showing half of Rwanda as rebel-controlled and said attacks would
spread to the central Gitarama and northeastern Byumba prefectures.
	   Last week, attacks were reported in Gitarama, Byumba and the
western Kibuye prefectures, but no details were available.
	   On Sunday, rebels killed a Presbyterian pastor and his family of
five in the northwestern Gisenyi region.
	   Meanwhile, a U.N. commission of inquiry into the illegal flow of
arms into the Great Lakes region arrived in Kigali. The four-man
comission was reactivated in April to investigate how Hutu rebels
were receiving weapons.
	   The rebels are believed to be based in northeastern Congo from
where they cross easily in and out of Rwanda. U.N. officials
believe the rebels may be assisted by a network of Hutu exiles and
businessmen in Africa and Europe.

World Cup: Spanish injury list smaller but veteran keeper
</HEADLINE>
Zubizarreta still a worry  
  By CIARAN GILES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ With just a week to go before its first
World Cup game, Spain's previously lengthy injury list looks to be
gradually getting smaller with only veteran goalkeeper and team
captain Andoni Zubizarreta still a cause for concern.
	   Thirty-six-year-old Zubizarreta stood out from his colleagues
Friday at the team's first training session in France because of
the exclusive attention he received from the team trainer owing to
a week-old left leg muscle problem.
	   While the rest of the team played passing and tackling exercises
at the Borgogones sports complex and coach Javier Clemente pumped
shots at substitute keepers Santiago Canizares and Paco Molina,
Zubizarreta carried out light reflex tests on his own in a corner
of the pitch.
	   ``The calendar for my recovery is in order, I'm responding as
expected,'' said Zubizarreta who will be taking part in his fourth
World Cup and who plans to retire from soccer once the tournament
is over.
	   The latest injury comes hot on the heels of another involving
his right leg. That sparked fears he would not be able to make it
to France.
	   Given his age and experience, Zubizarreta represents something
of a father figure for many on the side and his absence would be a
major blow at this stage.
	   The Basque keeper, who has played for such Spanish clubs as
Valencia, FC Barcelona and Atheltic de Bilbao, is confident of
being fit for the side's opening Group D game against Olympic
champion Nigeria on June 13 in the western city of Nantes. But he
is not sure when he will be able to take part fully in training.
	   ``I'm playing it by the day,'' he said. ``Today I feel better
than yesterday but I haven't got a set a date for being totally
recovered.''
	   Spain, which will also face Bulgaria and Paraguay, already is
missing one of its regular play-makers in Barcelona midfielder
Josep Guardiola who scratched himself off the team list due to knee
problems.
	   But other players hit by injury recently _ Real Madrid stars,
Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Morientes and
Barcelona's Abelardo Fernandez _ were all reported to be on the
mend.
	   Most worrying was Raul who suffered from groin pains all season
and had to rest for several days last week because of it.
	   ``I feel much better than I expected,'' said the 20-year-old who
many believe could prove to be one of the tournament's stars. ``I'm
now back training with the rest and that's good.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - All commercial space inside the arrival
and departure terminals of the new Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Sepang had been allocated, Transport Minister Datuk Seri
Dr Ling Liong Sik said today.
	   ``The entrepreneurs are now putting the finishing touches,'' he
said, adding that he had been shown artist's impressions of what
some of these duty-free shops and outlets would look like.
	   He said most of the businessmen had come up with imaginative
ideas and shoppers would feel like they were shopping in exotic
destinations such as Geneva, Rome and Venice.
	   Speaking to reporters at the new terminal after a briefing on
the latest on the airport development, he added: ``The final big
test for the Total Airport Management System will be held on June
25, two days before its opening by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku
Ja'afar.''
	   He said of the 23 TAMS functions, some had already achieved 100
per cent success while others were between 80 and 90 per cent.
	   Dr Ling said another ``real trial'' would be carried out on
Saturday, involving more than 2,000 people.
	   The test run would involve the movement of domestic and transit
passengers, handicapped people, plants, animals and public
transportation.
	   On the big shift by Malaysia Airlines on June 29, he said this
would involve 441 huge vehicles and 1,000 staff members to move
equipment from the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in
Subang to Sepang.
	   Dr Ling also said that 23 flights would land at the new KL
International Airport on the same night (June 29) and would take
off the following day.
	   The first flight out of the new airport, he added, would be a
MAS flight to Ipoh at 7.30am.
	   As for the last commercial flight out of the present
international airport, he said, this would be the KLM flight to
Amsterdam.
	   On freight forwarders' complaint of high fees levied at the new
airport, he said Malaysia Airports Bhd and Malaysia Airlines had
maintained the same charges as at the present airport.
	   He said all the available warehouse space had already been
signed up and paid for by the freight forwarders.

	   BATU PAHAT, Thurs. - The Health Ministry has decided to forbid
the sale of Viagra pill in the country until it gets an assurance
from the manufacturer that it will not be excessively priced.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the Ministry had
informed the manufacturer, Pfizer Inc, based in the United States,
of its intention and urged the company to reconsider its price
options.
	   Said Chua: ``We can do without Viagra if the company is going to
exploit the market to take advantage of the hype on the product.
	   ``Of course, there is also the uncertain health risk attached to
the usage of the pill to be considered,'' he said after opening the
Batu Pahat Rotary Club Haemodialysis Centre here today.
	   He said he had also discussed with Pfizer the possible health
risk involved for those taking the pill.
	   ``We categorically told the company that we would not allow the
distribution of the pill in the country until the company complies
to our conditions,'' he said.
	   On reports that the Viagra pill was already in circulation in
the country, Chua said it could be fakes.
	   ``It is illegal to distribute the pill in the country and we
believe consumers may be tricked into buying another pill which
bears a similar name to Viagra.''
	   ``Consumers are warned not to take the risk of using such pills
as such sex enhancement pills should be consumed only by doctors'
prescription,''
	   he said.
	   ``They should understand that while the pill has proven to cure
impotency in men, it can be harmful if improperly prescribed.''

Soccer team to boycott Romanian media at World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The national soccer team said Friday
it will refuse all interviews with Romanian media while in France
for the World Cup, following a media pasting for bad behavior
during a warm-up game against Paraguay this week.
	   ``We are deeply grieved by some dailies and TV stations'
attitude regarding us,'' the players said in a statement.
	   The statement said the team wants to keep calm during the
tournament, without distractions from media comments.
	   This followed a row about obscene gestures to supporters by
goalie Bogdan Stelea during the match against Paraguay, which a
surprisingly struggling Romania won 3-2 on a penalty kick.
	   Stelea pulled down his shorts to expose part of his backside to
the public and fingered the crowd.
	   Romanian media were sternly critical, but teammates defended
Stelea.
	   ``Because of you, the public is cursing us,'' star player
Gheorghe Hagi told journalists at a news conference.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The body of Somatel (M) Sendirian Berhad
manager Mohd Rashid Musa who was killed by gunmen in Somalia on
Monday, arrived here today.
	   The body, flown from Dubai onboard Malaysian Airlines flight
MH31, arrived at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport
in Subang about 7am.
	   Scores of relatives, friends and colleagues turned up at the
airport.
	   Hassan Aideed, brother of Somali political leader Hussein
Mohamed Aideed, and two of Rashid's colleagues, Sabri Hashim and
Azhar Othman, accompanied the body.
	   It was taken to his mother's house in Taman Sri Andalas in Klang
before being laid to rest at the Lipat Kajang Muslim cemetery.
	   Rashid, 40, manager of Somatel's office in Mogadishu, was shot
in the head by three men on Monday, after they had dragged him to a
van in what was believed a kidnap bid.
	   He died at the Digfair Hospital about 30 minutes later.
	   Meanwhile, KUB Holdings Bhd's corporate communications general
manager Natrah Abdullah said the company was still investigating
the motive of the alleged kidnap.

Nuclear processing plant that took Georgia material to shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, under
attack from anti-nuclear activists, announced Friday it will shut
down the nuclear processing plant in Scotland that just accepted a
controversial shipment from the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
	   ``The whole of Scotland is going to be breathing one massive
sigh of relief,'' said Lorraine Mann, a longtime critic of the
Dounreay plant on the coast of northern Scotland, which was built
in 1957.
	   Dounreay, which shut down its fast reactor in 1994 and stopped
producing electricity, will take no new nuclear shipments but will
finish reprocessing 15 tonnes (16.5 tons) of material from its own
reactor, the 0.8 kilogram (1.76 pounds) of nuclear material from
Georgia, and its existing commerical contracts, Energy Minister
John Battle said.
	   Battle said he hoped that all would be completed by 2006.
	   The cleaning-up process at the site could take up to 100 years,
said John McKeown, chief executive of Dounreay's operators, the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
	   The government insisted the decision was based on economics, not
safety, although an audit of plant safety is under way.
	   The independence-seeking Scottish National Party, a close
competitor of Blair's Labor Party in the search for Scottish votes,
opposed the operation of Dounreay and claimed Friday's announcement
as a victory.
	   SNP leader Alex Salmond taunted the government, saying, ``Anyone
with an interest in these matters has known for some considerable
time that Dounreay is not in a condition where it is safe to take
any extra nuclear material to it.''
	   The Georgian shipment in April _ 4.3 kilograms (9.46 pounds) of
highly enriched uranium and 0.8 kilograms (1.76 pounds) of spent
nuclear fuel _ was controversial in part because it was kept secret
in Britain and the story broke in the United States.
	   Blair said then, and his office repeated Friday, that the
decision was taken in the interests of nuclear non-proliferation,
to keep it out of the hands of terrorists or would-be nuclear
powers.
	   Earlier this week, Blair had accused the Scottish nationalists
of being ``irresponsible and extreme'' during another flap over
reports that enough uranium to make a half-dozen nuclear warheads
was missing from Dounreay.
	   The atomic energy authority said an internal inquiry listed 170
kilograms (374 pounds) of uranium as missing from work in the
mid-1960s, but contended it was a paper technicality, calculating
that the amount of material that went into the plant was
overestimated by 1 percent.
	   ``The concern now is to ensure that we pass on to future
generations a safe environment,'' said Donald Dewar, the
government's Cabinet secretary for Scotland.

	   BATU PAHAT, Thurs. - Haemodialysis centres of non-governmental
organisations should be licensed once the Private Healthcare
Facilities and Services Bill is gazetted soon.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the new Act would
ensure that NGO-run haemodialysis centres conform to the Ministry's
guidelines on such treatment.
	   Under the Act, all NGOs and private medical centres must obtain
operating licences to set up haemodialysis centres.
	   Chua said there were now 30 NGO-run haemodialysis centres and
another 50 run by private medical centres.
	   He added NGOs, which were not profit-oriented, needed to be
advised on maintaining a high level of professionalism in the
running of such centres.

	   Talks between the Executive and Legislative branch continued on
Thursday with the first meeting of a commission that will follow
the progress of nation's most important legislation through
Congress, Notimex reported.
	   At the meeting of the Intermediary Commission, the members
agreed to ask congressional committees to release information on
the status of proposals such as the financial package and the
Indigenous Rights Proposal.
	   Representing the Legislative side were Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Enrique Jackson, Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD) Deputy Demetrio Sodi, and National
Action Party (PAN) Senator Ricardo Garcia Cervantes while Deputy
Interior Secretary Jorge Alcocer represented the Executive.
	   Alcocer said that the commission will meet again next Thursday
when the 15 Chamber of Deputies and Senate committees have reported
on the status of the pertinent bills.
	   The Intermediary Commission was formed by the Interior
Secretariat (Gobernacion) and Congress in order to make sure the
proposals to be discussed in a possible extraordinary session and
September's regularly-scheduled ordinary session do not get lost in
committee.
	   The Gobernacion official said that a date for the extraordinary
session will be determined in one of the upcoming commission
meetings.
	   ``Right now we are only in agreement on the mechanism we will
use to move our work forward,''
	   Alcocer said after the meeting.
	   But even agreeing on the mechanism was a task that required
several meetings between Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida and
the congressional delegation coordinators.
	   The fact that Mexico's two most important governmental powers
are a testament to how relations have improved since Labastida took
office.
	   PAN Senator Ricardo Garcia Cervantes said the commission also
agreed to solicit ``detailed information'' from the Finance
Secretariat and the Banco de Mexico about the financial reform
package which is expected to be discussed and approved during the
extraordinary session.
	   Although Garcia Cervantes recognized that part of the
commission's work was to make sure the financial reforms were ready
for a special session, he said the bills would not be rushed
through Congress.
	   ``We are aware that there are important pending issues like the
financial package, but there is no haste that can justify
irresponsibility. The economy would run greater risks if it is
governed by irresponsible measures,'' the panista said.
	   PRD Deputy Demetrio Sodi added that the Intermediary Commission
hopes to ``convert 15 of the nation's most important laws into
constitutional changes by the end of the year.''

	   VOTE OF CONFIDENCE ... Faith in the skill of Terengganu's boat
craftsmen made Warren Blake, 58, and his wife Tue, 50, of New
Zealand, decide to build a whaler in Pulau Duyung.
	   Although New Zealand is well-known for its boat-building
heritage, the couple made up their mind to have the boat built in
Terengganu because of its skilled craftsmen.
	   The decision to construct the 53.5 metre-long whaler in Pulau
Duyung is all the more surprising when one considers that Blake
comes from a seafaring family.
	   For he is a cousin of Sir Peter Blake who broke the world record
by sailing around the world in 71 days in 1994.
	   Blake is a geophysicist by profession while Tue teaches
Vietnamese at the National University of Singapore.
	   ``This 55-tonne whaler has been named The Four Friends. It was
built for our two children, Su and Philips, (aged 22 and 19
respectively), both of whom are studying marine biology at James
Cook University in Queensland, Australia,'' he said.
	   Blake said a wooden mermaid had been mounted at the bow of the
vessel to remind his family of Pulau Duyung (which literally means
Mermaid Island).
	   He said with a fuel capacity of 5,000 litres, the whaler would
be ideal for the family to sail continuously for two months to
carry out research on marine life, including whales and dolphins.

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Friday brought together for the
first time the main parties in the Diana investigation, in an
effort to finally clarify the role of photographers in the crash.
	   Grouped together were the photographers under investigation in
the case; eight witnesses to the crash; Mohamed Al Fayed; Diana's
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, and the parents of driver Henri Paul.
They were accompanied by a platoon of lawyers.
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel last Aug. 31 killed Diana,
her companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But was it merely a case of a drunk driver, or was there
responsibility on the part of the paparazzi trailing Diana's
Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and one press motorcyclist have been placed
under investigation _ a step short of being formally charged. They
have remained in legal limbo for almost a year, continuing their
work.
	   In what was seen as a last-ditch effort to clarify their roles,
Stephan was questioning each photographer one by one.
	   Lawyers and witnesses emerging from the courtroom described the
process. The judge asked each photographer to give an account of
their role that night. He then questioned them, questioned
witnesses as to what they had seen of the photographer's behavior,
and opened questions to other lawyers.
	   According to lawyers, photographer Romuald Rat was harshly
questioned by lawyers for Al Fayed, who tried to establish that he
pursued the Mercedes that night.
	   ``I followed it. I did not pursue it,'' Rat responded.
	   During an afternoon break, Al Fayed railed against the
paparazzi.
	   ``If I was not in a courtroom, I would hang them all,'' he said.
	   ``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did. They were
like vultures around the bodies.''
	   Al Fayed also had harsh words for Diana's mother.
	   ``She won't talk to me,'' he said. ``She thinks she's in the
royal family. ``I'm just an ordinary guy, a working-class guy. It's
snobbery.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd emerged from the courtroom during a break, but
waved away journalists.
	   She, Al Fayed, and Paul's family are civil parties in the case,
meaning they have access to documents and proceedings.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   ``It's so painstaking,'' Mailliez told The Associated Press of
the meeting. ``It's thorough, but it's taking a long time.''
	   Lawyers said the policemen who spoke accused Rat of hindering
their work.
	   Another witness, private chauffeur Clifford Gooroovadoo, said
he'd told the judge he saw Rat and another photographer, Christian
Martinez, fighting just after the accident. He said Rat, after
taking his own pictures, was telling Martinez to stop.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many close to the case believe they will soon be exonerated, at
least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,''
Arsov told The AP. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have
to do their job.''
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily guarded by police.
	   Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a Mercedes,
surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

Saudi arms tycoon reaches deal with Ritz over 8-million pound
</HEADLINE>
gambling debt  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Saudi arms tycoon and high-roller Adnan Khashoggi
on Friday reached an out-of-court settlement with London's Ritz
Casino over a multimillion pound (dlr) losing streak in the spring
of 1986.
	   Lawyers announced on the fourth day a High Court hearing that
the casino had settled its 8-million pound (dlrs 13.2 million)
claim, and Khashoggi withdrew charges that the Ritz let him gamble
on credit, which is illegal. Neither side gave details of the
settlement.
	   Witnesses testified that Khashoggi, who lives in Paris and did
not show up in court, gambled 10.1 million pounds (then dlrs 14
million) on the tables at the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly between the
end of January and April 10, 1986.
	   At first he was winning and his checks for chips were honored.
But then the tables turned, Khashoggi kept buying, and 16 checks
for 200,000 pounds (then dlrs 280,000) each bounced. The checks
were drawn on an account with Swiss Banking Corporation of Geneva
on three days at the end of March and were rejected April 10.
	   The casino sued to recover the checks plus interest since 1986
which had run up to about 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.15 million).
	   Lawyers for Khashoggi, 63, claimed the debt was unenforceable
because he had an arrangement with the casino to continue gambling
on credit, illegal under Britain's Gaming Act.
	   The casino said it sued as a last resort. ``Casinos don't want
to be seen to be suing their clients. It's extremely bad PR,'' Max
Kingsley, former managing director of the Ritz Casino's parent
company, told the court.
	   Judge Richard Rougier said he was happy to hear of the deal.
	   ``It seemed to me preeminently an action which was better
compromised on acceptable terms than fought to a finish. It had
quite a few complexities and wrinkles,'' he commented.

	   KUANTAN, Thurs. - Universiti Teknologi Malaysia has proposed
three sites in Pekan for the development of its branch campus.
	   The locations are in Peramu Jaya, Kota Inderapura and Sungai
Miang.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Khalil Yaakob is expected to hold
further discussions with Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun
Razak soon before deciding on the site.
	   State Education and Religious Affairs Committee chairman Datuk
Adnan Yaakob said the State Government would also liaise with the
Pekan district and land office and State Land and Mines Department.
	   ``This is to ensure that the proposed sites do not belong to
anyone or have been pledged to other government agencies,'' he
said.
	   UTM vice-chancellor Datuk Dr Ahmad Zaharuddin Idrus had earlier
called on Khalil to brief him on the development plans and propose
the locations.
	   He was accompanied by deputy vice-chancellor (development) Prof
Zainal Abidin Ahmad, executive director Aziruddin Razak and
treasurer Mohamad Abdullah.
	   Today's meeting was a follow-up to an announcement by Najib last
month that a UTM branch campus would be developed in Pekan.
	   Meanwhile, Ahmad Zaharuddin said the cost of the project would
depend on the size of land provided by the State Government.
	   He said the first batch of 300 students to study at the branch
campus was being housed at the main campus in Skudai, Johor. They
will move to a temporary branch campus in Jalan Bukit Ubi here for
the second semester of the present academic year.
	   The branch campus will offer degree courses in automotive,
petro- chemical, electrical and electronic engineering as well as
information technology.
	   On a request by the Education Ministry that universities
increase their intake to accommodate deserving students who have
failed to enter local public institutes of higher learning, Ahmad
Zaharuddin said UTM could accommodate 200 more students.

Yeltsin concerned Russians leaving Caucasus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Friday he is
concerned that ethnic Russians are leaving the often restive
regions of the North Caucasus.
	   ``This is a very alarming signal,'' Yeltsin told regional
leaders at a meeting in the Kremlin.
	   The North Caucasus includes Chechnya, which has declared
independence, and neighboring Ingushetia and Dagestan, all of which
are mainly Muslim.
	   It also includes predominantly Orthodox Christian North Ossetia,
which has maintained warmer relations with the Kremlin than other
places in the region and served as a launching base for Moscow's
1994-96 campaign against Chechen separatists.
	   ``Russians are leaving the Northern Caucasus almost as quickly
as they are leaving former U.S.S.R. republics,'' Yeltsin said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He gave no figures or reason for the exodus.
	   Many people of all ethnic groups have fled the former Soviet
republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus, either to seek a better
life in more prosperous Russian cities, or to escape rampant crime
and ethnic conflicts.
	   Yeltsin also met Friday with Magomedali Magomedov, the leader of
Dagestan, where recent clashes between police and Muslim militants
took place.
	   Magomedov again said that the unrest didn't grow into a
full-scale war because most Dagestani people have no intention of
seceding from Russia, and their protests are aimed against social
and economic troubles in the region, Yeltsin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.

	   IT's been 11 days since Indah Water Konsortium Sdn Bhd's
deadline to re- align underground sewerage pipes along Jalan
Puchong to ease traffic congestion expired but the situation
remains almost the same.
	   Serdang MP Datuk Yap Pian Hon said Puchong residents were fuming
over the delay in work at the 12.8km point along Jalan Puchong.
	   He said the pipes were to have been relocated from the centre of
the road to the road shoulder owned by Island  Peninsula Bhd.
	   According to him, IWK had obtained permission from Island 
Peninsula Bhd but failed to notify Kinrara TUDM camp authorities
that a fraction of their land would also be affected.
	   He said IWK's mistake had delayed the relocation of pipes.
	   He said IWK had informed him the work would be further delayed
as written permission from Kinrara TUDM Camp had to be obtained.
	   IWK, at a Press conference on May 22, had assured residents that
work to realing the pipes would be completed by May 25, with work
being carried out around the clock.
	   Meanwhile, resident K. Rajeswari said she had to spend an about
1 1/2 hours on the road to and from her office at IOI Mall Puchong
to Taman Kinrara where she stayed.
	   She said it normally took her only 15 minutes to travel between
her house and the office.
	   Yet, others have resorted to using the highway just to avoid the
bad stretch of about 800 metres.
	   Yusuf Asmadi, who works in Petaling Jaya, has resorted to using
the Kesas Highway, coming out through the Batu Tiga interchange
into the Federal Highway and then proceeding to Petaling Jaya which
is costing him RM4.80 in toll charges daily.
	   At present, IWK's pipe-laying work involves about 800 metres in
the middle of Jalan Puchong from section 5 of Taman Kinrara to the
Taman Bukit Kuchai/Taman Mawar junction.

	   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
Commissioner Doris Meissner on Thursday called the murder of a
border agent near Nogales, Ariz., an ''ironic tragedy,'' noting the
agent had arrived in the United States as a refugee only 10 years
ago.
	   ''It's very compelling,'' Meissner said. ''It's a terrible
thing, and we're working closely with Mexican officials on the
case.'' Border patrol agent Alexander Kirpnic, 27, a Ukranian
refugee whose family emigrated from the former Soviet Union less
than a decade ago, died Wednesday after being shot in the head by
suspected drug traffickers.
	   Kirpnic was shot west of Nogales, when five backpackers were
stopped by two U.S. border agents. One suspect took out his gun,
Meissner said, and killed Kirpnic. Agents recovered two backpacks
filled with marijuana.
	   ''We have some people in custody,'' Meissner said. ''But we
don't know if we have them all.'' INS records showed one of five
suspects in custody by Thursday afternoon, but officials did not
reveal the suspect's name.
	   ''The timing is terrible,'' said M. Delal Baer, director of the
Mexico project of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ''This was a violent act, but Mexico-U.S. relations were
already strained, and it may make cooperation difficult.''
Kirpnic's killing was the first border patrol agent murder this
year.

	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa denied Thursday
that a raid on a small Chiapas town was an act of political
persecution, Notimex reported.
	   ``The governor asked us to carry out this action due to a clear
violation of the law,'' Labastida said about the raid on San
Nicholas Ruiz that netted 167 prisoners. Original reports said 147
were arrested.
	   ``What we Mexicans have to see clearly is that the law has to be
applied to all Mexicans without any discrimination.''
	   Labastida was especially proud that not a single shot was fired
during the raid and said using children as human shields -- as the
San Nicolas Ruiz villagers allegedly did -- was ``cowardly.''
	   The head of the Interior Secretariat (Gobernacion) confidently
predicted that the raid -- similar to ones conducted on villages
sympathetic to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)
would not affect peace negotiations with the rebel Zapatistas.
	   Unlike Taniperlas and Agua Tinta, San Nicolas Ruiz was strongly
allied with the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD).
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen requested the military
action because the town's PRD majority had allegedly violently
expelled 33 families that support the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
	   In his explanation of the raid, Labastida said the village ``had
already experienced agitation,'' and that such conflicts in the
region were frequently solved by the ``Law of the Jungle,'' not by
law and justice.
	   Interviewed again later Thursday, Labastida insisted that the
action was simply ``the application of the law,'' not the
``persecution of anyone for their ideology.'' ``The government is
obliged to make sure the law is followed and respected by all
Mexicans,'' the Gobernacion chief said.
	   If one group is allowed to be expelled because they think
differently than a minority group, the individual guarantees and
human rights of the minority have been violated, Labastida said.
	   ``In our country, Mexicans have the right to act and think
according to what each person has decided for themselves. But this
freedom should never be allowed to represent a violation of the law
and of the rights of other people,'' said the Interior Secretary.
	   Meanwhile, the Chiapas Attorney General's Office (PGJE) said
Thursday that another 10 people arrested in San Nicolas Ruiz were
arraigned on charges of disobedience and resistance.
	   Of the 167 people arrested during Wednesday's raid, 151 were
released for lack of evidence.
	   A PGJE official said the high number of arrests was due to the
villagers' attempt to prevent soldiers and policemen from carrying
out 12 arrest warrants.

Pakistan promises restraint, but won't fall behind India
</HEADLINE>
  By ARTHUR MAX  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Faced with a demand for nuclear
restraint, Pakistan promised Friday to act responsibly but said it
won't allow itself to fall behind neighboring rival India.
	   ``While we will not provoke escalation, our responses will be
carefully calibrated to respond to any provocation or escalation by
India,'' said a government statement.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of the five established
nuclear powers called on India and Pakistan to step back from the
brink of nuclear confrontation after both tested atomic devices
last month.
	   The Pakistani statement did not address the specifics of the
foreign ministers' demand to refrain from deploying nuclear
weapons, conducting more missile tests or producing fissile
material.
	   Nor did Pakistan say if it would consider joining the
nonproliferation regimes that have kept a lid on the spread of
nuclear technology. India calls those treaties discriminatory since
they do not ask the nuclear powers to disarm. Pakistan says it will
sign them only if India does.
	   ``We will continue to conduct ourselves with restraint and
responsibility,'' said the statement issued by the Foreign
Ministry. ``However, Pakistan will not allow itself to be placed in
a position of strategic vulnerability or inequality.''
	   In Geneva, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain,
Russia, China and France offered their help in ``promoting
reconciliation and conciliation.''
	   But they stopped short of proposing mediation on the disputed
territory of Kashmir, which has triggered two of the three
Indo-Pakistan wars.
	   Pakistan would welcome such mediation. Its statement said the
Geneva initiative should be the beginning of international
involvement in the Indian subcontinent. In the past, India has said
the Kashmir problem must be sorted out by the two countries alone.
	   The statement also offered to resume talks between the top
foreign ministry officials of India and Pakistan that were
suspended last year.
	   ``But it is evident now that the bilateral dialogue needs to be
supplemented by a broader multilateral process to promote durable
peace and security in South Asia,'' it said.
	   India detonated a series of devices starting May 11. Rejecting
international attempts to forestall a Pakistani test, Islamabad
demonstrated its own nuclear capability on May 28.
	   ``We are not interested in a nuclear or conventional arms
race,'' the statement said, noting Pakistan had previously called
for regional and bilateral nonproliferation agreements.

	   Serial murder expert and former FBI agent Robert K. Ressler will
work with Mexican officials to solve the slayings of dozens of
women in Ciudad Juarez, French news agency AFP reported, citing a
Thursday article in a Mexico City daily.
	   Since 1993, 112 women have been killed in Ciudad Juarez after
being sexually abused and tortured, say humanitarian groups. The
government figure is 87.
	   Most of the women killed have been workers in maquiladoras, the
border factories that are aplenty in Ciudad Juarez, which lies
across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas.
	   Ressler, who is credited with coining the term ``serial
killers,'' confirmed he would be working on the case and would go
to Ciudad Juarez this month but left the date up to Chihuahua state
prosecutors to decide, the report said.
	   Ressler has worked on investigations in Japan, Austria, England
and South Africa. In South Africa, he developed a successful
profile that led to the arrest of Moses Sithole, who was accused of
killing 36 women.
	   Ressler also assisted in the writing of the novel, ``Silence of
the Lambs,'' whose main character, Hannibal ``The Cannibal''
Lecter, was based on a real-life serial killer.
	   The Federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) confirmed Ressler's
visit, which was approved in May by federal deputies, the PGR and
the federal Commission on Equality and Gender.

	   WHILE it may not be the perfect solution for a lethargic
economy, the creation of the Asset Management Company (AMC) to take
over the banking system's non-performing loans (NPLs), will provide
a much needed breathing space for bankers and borrowers alike. The
main aim, however, is to ensure that given the tight economic
situation, any adverse effects from the grossly weakened Malaysian
economy will not push the country too far into the corner and
hamper recovery efforts. Before the concept of establishing the AMC
emerged, all the dreaded indications of an economy pinned down and
helpless were clearly visible. The banking system has been central
to all these concerns and the Government as well as the economic
policymakers have been striving to protect the sector. The
spotlight may turn to the private business sector next since it has
also suffered greatly from the current economic turmoil.
	   The declining ringgit adversely affected the earnings of
corporations as well as their foreign debt exposure. This later
translated into tightening cashflows which in turn affected their
loan servicing schedules. Bankers, on their part, were faced with
the tightening liquidity in the financial system, which came about
as the Government moved to check the exposure of banks to loans,
especially to non-productive sectors. To top it all, due to
borrowers' problems in servicing their debts, the level of NPLs in
the banking system was expected to increase steadily. This was
considered an unhealthy development and one which demanded
pre-emptive corrective measures.
	   The problem was compounded by the fact that the NPLs needed to
be funded and provisions had to be made for them. This consumed
most of the available funds - meant for lending purposes - in the
banking system. The mountain of NPLs also demanded more management
time on the part of banks, making it difficult for many to juggle
their normal banking practices such as lending and managing
deposits with allocating resources to unproductive activities such
as managing bad loans. As for the affected borrowers, the spectre
of legal proceedings to recover loans and the foreclosure of
collateral was ever present. With such overhanging threats,
companies were also preoccupied with their own loan exposure,
causing them tp pay less attention to everyday business. While one
may point out the option of traditional debt-reconstruction
exercises, such moves will cost an already burdened company more as
it will have to appoint advisers and inevitably prolong the period
of interest payments.
	   With the seemingly reduced options, the creation of the AMC was
necessary as a pre-emptive measure in preventing the NPL situation
from completely choking the economy. While the 9.1 per cent level
of NPLs in the banking system as at the end of March this year was
still manageable, the effects of the steadily rising level are
becoming apparent in the shape of increasingly scarce credit
facilities and the many debt-ridden companies. The Government
simply cannot ignore the situation as the price will be a stagnant
economy, without the necessary avenues for any form of recovery at
all.
	   Placing the NPLs and assets pledged against such loans with the
AMC should not put any party in a disadvantageous position. These
assets will be nurtured back to viability before being sold in the
open market. In other words, they will not be left idle, but will
undergo an almost similar exercise to the one that a business under
corporate recovery and turnaround management would go through.
There is also nothing to stop the initial owners from acquiring
these assets after they have met their loan committments. As in
debt reconstruction exercises, the benefit to borrowers is apparent
in the extension of time given to them to service their debts.
Meanwhile, the assets they pledged are managed by professionals.
The banks in turn, will now have their funds freed from the
stringent provisions they had to make for the acquired NPLs. All
this translates into a much needed injection of liquidity into the
financial system to revitalise a slowly choking economy.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - Residents of Kampung Tersusun Jelapang Jaya have
lodged a police report against an ironwork factory located near
their homes for causing dust and noise pollution which is affecting
their health.
	   The report was made by the residents action committee chairman
A.
	   Sebastian at the Jelapang police station at 10am.
	   He was accompanied by about 10 residents.
	   Sebastian said the residents were disappointed with the
authorities for not taking any action despite various complaints
forwarded to the Ipoh City Council and the Department of
Environment.
	   The committee had also sent letters of complaint to State Health
and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Lee Chee Leong and State
Industrial and Entrepreneur Development Committee chairman Datuk
Seri Junus Wahid.
	   Sebastian said some 300 families living in the area had to put
up with the noise and air pollution during its operation from
6.30am to 7pm daily.

	   PACIFIC Bank Bhd posted a lower pre-tax profit at the bank level
to RM26.74 million for the quarter ended March 31 1998 as against
RM33.44 million for the last quarter.
	   This was due mainly to increase in loan loss provision charged
to profit and loss account, which amounted to RM44.2 million in
view of its stringent provisioning policy.
	   Interest income was RM249.09 million compared with RM222.98
million before.
	   Profit after tax also declined to RM11.44 million, down from
RM22.17 million previously.
	   Earnings per share was 3.36 sen from 6.51 sen before.
	   The bank's risk-weighted capital ratio stood at 10.84 per cent,
down from 11.36 per cent previously.

<TEXT>
	   Heavyweight Ray Murcer, who was to fight on the undercard
against Jerry Ballard, also was suspended for medical reasons, said
Ralph Petrillo, medical coordinator for the athletic commission.
	   Petrillo said Akinwande was under a medical suspension, but he
declined to elaborate.
	   The decision is yet another blow to Akinwande's career. He was
disqualified during a bout against WBC champ Lennox Lewis in July
for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was fighting for a piece of the title for the
second time in less than a year was due more to his choice of
promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle, promoter Don
King matched him against Orlin Norris, Jr., and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included 46-year-old
Roberto Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a
decision in Panama in his last fight after getting knocked down in
the first round.

Antarctic Treaty nations agree on environmental rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The 26 countries that manage Antarctica
announced Friday that they settled key rules for protecting the
frozen continent's fragile environment.
	   Concern about increased human activity on the vast area
surrounding the South Pole was a main topic for the 22nd Antarctic
Consultative Meeting, in the northern city of Tromsoe.
	   ``Now we have in place a unique and comprehensive set of
regulations for an entire continent. This is important not in the
least because the global significance of the Antarctic has become
greater at the same time as pressure on its resources increases,''
Norwegian delegation leader Dagfinn Stenset was quoted as telling
the national news agency NTB.
	   Norwegian polar expert Arne Orheim was elected as chairman of
the new environmental committee and said it already set up five
working groups to identify threats to Antarctic.
	   ``The most important working group will approve environmental
impact assessments for all projects of significant scope in the
Antarctic,'' he was quoted as telling NTB.
	   He said the committee will also present an environmental status
report for the region to the Antarctic Conference in 2000.
	   The meeting failed to agree on which nation would be the site of
its Antarctic secretariat, a problem that has lingered for decades.
	   Under the treaty, nations put aside territorial claims in the
Antarctic, and agreed to use it only for peaceful, nonmilitary
purposes.

EU backs Russian tax measures

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers on Friday
endorsed the Russian government's plans to restore financial
stability and increase tax revenues.
	   ``We strongly support the emphasis of Russia's government on
reforms to strengthen the fiscal situation and the financial
situation generally and thereby promote growth,'' the 15 EU
ministers said in a statement.
	   The ministers said they were ready to consider further support
for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help
shore up the Russian reforms.
	   They urged Russia to ``fully and rapidly'' implement the reform
program.
	   ``The Russian authorities have crafted a credible package of
policies which will strengthen the fundamentals of the Russian
economy and allow confidence to return'' said the statement issued
after the minister's day-long meeting.
	   The EU acknowledged the dangers Russia's financial woes posed
for Western Europe. ``We are monitoring Russia's situation closely.
Russia's economic stability is vitally important to all our
interests,'' the statement said.

Bosnian Croats apparently pressured to shelve plans for new party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Bosnian Croat leaders met Friday with
their patron, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, amid indications
that he might pressure them to back off on plans to form a new
political party.
	   A terse statement issued after the closed meeting said the unity
of the existing main party _ the Croatian Democratic Union _ should
be preserved and it should ``act united'' at the upcoming Sept.
elections, according to the state news agency HINA.
	   The new party is to be led by Kresimir Zubak, the Bosnian Croat
member of the tripartite Bosnian presidency. It is to be formed
next Sunday, effectively splitting the Croatian Democratic Union,
the Bosnian branch of Tudjman's governing party, and breaking its
near monopoly on Bosnian Croat votes.
	   In announcing the planned new party, Zubak said he wanted to
distance himself from he old party leadership, composed of people
``who amassed wealth during the war ... and who want to divide
Bosnia.''
	   In an interview Friday with the daily Vjesnik, Zubak suggested
the old party's leadership still wants to annex south-western
Bosnia, which they control, to Croatia proper, thereby neglecting
Bosnian Croats elsewhere.
	   Zubak, a moderate, pledged to fully respect the peace plan,
which envisages a united country and unimpeded return of refugees
of all ethnic groups _ something hard-line Croat nationalists in
the old party oppose.
	   International officials signaled their support on Thursday by
allowing Zubak's new party to run in September elections, even
though the deadline for registering had expired.

growing pension fund administrator (Afore) system in Latin America,
the bank said, where Mexico, after Brazil has the most potential in
terms of dimension and growth.
	   Analysts are also optimistic about Mexico's future in the
industry.
	   ``The concept of pension funds under management is so new,'' the
developing market will offer great potential growth, said Patrick
Boucher, Santander brokerage house banking analyst.
	   ``We will see less money in bank savings and more in mutual
funds,'' to accumulate pension savings, he said.
	   BBV's move comes after the bank started closing a
precedent-setting transaction to acquire Afore Previnter, the first
Afore merger. The Previnter acquisition makes Profuturo the second
ranking Afore operator in affiliates, with 1.8 million, and third
in potential affiliate base, with 15 percent of the market.
	   Confia-Principal says its move will increase its market share
1.52 percent and increase the number of workers in its scheme to
more than 260,000.
	   The government estimates the potential market for pension fund
affiliates at 17 million people. To date, 96 percent of the
potential market has joined an Afore.
	   BBV is a market leader in Afore investment, generating about
3.78 billion dollars in funds, owned by 3.8 million participants.

	   THE University College London in Gower Street will provide 34
scholarships for Asian students in the coming academic year.
	   UCL registrar Martin Butcher said in a statement yesterday
current or prospective students from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea were eligible to apply.
	   The scholarships, under the British Scholarship Scheme, will
provide funds of between STG1,600 (about RM10,000) and STG4,000
each.
	   Butcher said the scholarships would be made on the basis of
academic merit and financial need.
	   He said the scheme was in addition to the recently-established
Shell Centenary Scholarship and the Overseas Research Student
Scholarship Scheme, which provide some form of financial support
for overseas students at UCL, in excess of STG400,000 annually.
	   ``The college is determined that economic and political
difficulties should not prevent the best and brightest graduates
and undergraduates from studying here,'' he said.
	   British authorities, through the British Council, recently set
up an emergency scholarship fund for needy students from the four
countries.
	   The STG6.6 million fund is supported by the British Council, the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British universities and British
companies through the Department of Trade and Industry.
	   The scholarship scheme under the fund is a one-time issue and
only covers the 1998/99 academic year.
	   British companies which have contributed to the fund include
Standard Chartered, British Gas International, ICI, and Prudential
Corporation Asia.

	   BANDAR Utama Development Sdn Bhd re-opened the western ramp of
the Bandar Utama overhead bridge leading to Tropicana Golf and
Country Club today, succumbing to pressure from residents and
motorists inconvenienced by the closure.
	   The ramp will, however, only remain open until the completion of
the Damansara-Puchong Highway's (LDP) Damansara Utama underpass.
	   Bandar Utama special projects manager Paul Tong said the
Petaling Jaya Municipal Council had agreed with the proposal.
	   ``We made a proposal to MPPJ and it was agreed that the ramp
will be opened for traffic heading to the New Klang Valley
Expressway toll plaza and Tropicana Golf and Country Club only
until the completion of the LDP's Damansara Utama underpass,'' he
said.
	   ``We believe that the opening of the ramp is a win-win situation
for all parties concerned especially the public which is the main
reason for our decision as advised by MPPJ president Datuk Mohamad
Nor Bador.''
	   The western ramp, which is only meant for temporary usage, was
closed on April 23 as Bandar Utama felt that the permanent access
should have been built by Tropicana Golf and Country Resorts Bhd.
	   TGCR had, however, said the closure was not proper as the right
to close the ramp was within its jurisdiction, not Bandar Utama's,
according to an agreement entered by both parties in 1993.
	   TGCR had also explained that it had completed its part of the
permanent access road but that it could not be connected to Lebuh
Bandar Utama due to the fact that Tenaga Nasional Berhad and
Selangor Islamic Religious Department reserve land stood between
the two areas.
	   Currently, the underpass which was opened early last month, only
allows free flow to motorists from Section 17 heading towards
Kelana Jaya, from Kelana Jaya to Damansara Jaya, from Damansara
Jaya to Taman Tun Dr Ismail and Taman Tun Dr Ismail to Section 17.
	   He said traffic from Taman Tun Dr Ismail and Bandar Utama
heading towards the toll plaza was not allowed to turn right at the
underpass to go to the toll plaza.
	   ``Currently, they need to use the overhead bridge, turn left and
make a U-turn before the pedestrian bridge or head into Damansara
Utama and make a turn back to the main road at the roundabout near
the mosque,'' he said.
	   He hoped that with the opening of the ramp, the traffic
congestion at SS21/64 linking the New Klang Valley Expressway toll
plaza will be reduced considerably,'' he said.
	   He also hoped that Bandar Utama residents would be tolerant and
patient for the wider interest of the public until the completion
of the underpass.

Aegean security depends on Turkey, Greece says
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Bulgarian reaction in 12th graf, Istanbul meeting
last graf  

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The success of NATO-backed
confidence-building measures on sharing the Aegean Sea depends on
Turkey upholding its end of the bargain, Greece's foreign minister
said Friday.
	   ``From our side, I have confidence that we will do everything
possible to uphold the agreement,'' Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said. ``As for the other side, I hope _ because that's all
I can do _ that they display equivalent behavior.''
	   The measures, presented by NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
in Brussels on Thursday, are based on a 1988 Greek-Turkish
agreement that was never fully implemented.
	   At the time, both countries agreed to respect each other's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and rights to use Aegean waters
and international airspace.
	   The accord also called for a moratorium on military maneuvers in
the Aegean during July and August. Both Turkey and Greece hold
regular exercises in the area, where they have come to the brink of
war twice in the past 11 years over territorial disputes.
	   Pangalos blamed Turkey for the breakdown of the original
confidence-building measures.
	   ``There is a troubled past,'' the foreign minister said, adding
that the failure of the 1988 agreement stemmed ``from an attempt to
tie other disputes into the specific issues being discussed.''
	   The accord collapsed following accusations of air and sea space
violations by both sides. The only part upheld was a moratorium on
military exercises during the summer tourist season.
	   This time, success depends on Turkey putting into practice what
it has signed, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   ``This is a good first step, but it's not enough,'' he
explained. ``It has to be put into practice with respect for the
national integrity and independence of both countries.''
	   The Turkish foreign ministry on Thursday welcomed the agreement,
saying it could ``contribute to a peaceful solution to all problems
between the two countries.''
	   Bulgaria, which neighbors Greece and Turkey, also praised the
accord.
	   ``The political will demonstrated by the Greek and Turkish
governments is a further major step towards building confidence and
stability in the region,'' Bulgarian Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Radko Vlaikov said.
	   The foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey and another
six Balkan nations will be gathering in Istanbul on June 8 and 9 to
discuss regional problems.

UN inspectors seek to rally Security Council support
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Iraq agreeing to work with UNSCOM but
rejects ``road map,'' TRIMS
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq agreed Friday to work with U.N. arms
inspectors ``to finalize work quickly'' to ending sanctions but
rejected a ``road map'' of disarmanent steps which the chief
inspector will carry to Baghdad next week.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler travels to Iraq next week to
spell out specific measures Iraq must take so the U.N. Special
Commission can certify that Iraq is free of illegal weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the Security Council to lift
sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Guld War.
	   Following a two-day briefing to the council, Butler said
Thursday that experts have nearly accounted for all Iraqi chemical
artillery shells but ``fairly large gaps'' remain in other weapons
areas.
	   He said he was taking along a ``road map'' of specific measures.
They include release of documents pertaining to Iraq's long-range
missiles as well
	   as chemical and biological weapons production.
	   During a press conference, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Baghdad was prepared to work with the
commission and the Security Council based on a ``professional,
scientific and technical approach
	   which confines itself to the requirements of disarmanent.''
	   But he said the inspectors ``keep insisting on the same
`non-starter' approach of casting doubts, building their
understanding on assumptions, suspicions and not on facts and
figures,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all illegal weapons but that the
United States and Britain are manipulating the commission to
maintain sanctions indefinitely.
	   Al-Sahhaf's remarks indicate the Iraqis still insist that the
inspectors should simply verify what Baghdad has already disclosed
about its weapons programs, accepting Iraqi declarations as fact.
	   The inspectors claim they have the authority to conduct more
far-reaching inspections and not simply base their estimates of
Iraqi capabilities on information Baghdad has supplied.
	   ``A `road map' is something that shows the way from `Point A' to
`Point B,''' said an Iraqi source on condition of anonymity. ``We
say we are already at `Point B.'''
	   That raises doubts whether the Iraqis will be prepared to
provide new documentation when they meet Butler in Baghdad on June
12-13.
	   ``It's really just an excuse to ask for a new slogan, that of
access to documents,'' Amir al-Saadi, an Iraqi presidential
adviser. ``All the documents relevant to disarmanent have been
provided.''
	   Butler's two-day briefing to the council was aimed at easing
pressure from France, Russia and China to justify his claims that
Iraq may still be holding illegal weapons.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's briefing proved
that ``Iraq is deceiving ... the Security Council'' and ``this must
stop if it expects to
	   get sanctions lifted.''
	   U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
briefing was part of a ``power struggle'' within the council
between the Americans and Britons _ who have been strongly critical
of Iraq _ and the Russians, French and Chinese who have been
sympathetic to Baghdad's position.
	   Those five countries are permanent council members and have
strongly entrenched positions regarding Iraq. Each faction is
trying to win support among the 10 non-permanent members.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - Deputy Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Datuk Abu Bakar Daud said today the water
crisis should make people more aware of the importance of
protecting natural resources.
	   He said the water shortage especially in the Klang Valley was
partly due to river pollution and the situation was worsened by the
dry spell.
	   Abu Bakar said this after launching the Worldwide Fund for
Nature Malaysia's Handbook on Integrated Coastal and Estuarine Area
Management at Guinness Anchor Bhd.
	   At the launch, he read the speech of Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng Ding.
	   Law said he hoped the awareness caused by the crisis would
remain deeply rooted among the people so that they would not take
water for granted.
	   ``I also hope the water crisis will be an eye opener for us not
to pollute our rivers and destroy our catchment areas which are
critical elements in our water supply,'' he said.
	   WWF Malaysia's president Tan Sri Khir Johari said there were
three key factors to solve the crisis and prevent it from recurring
- effective conservation, proper management and wise consumption.

	   RHB Sakura Merchant Bankers Bhd recorded a higher pre-tax profit
of RM31.25 million for the financial quarter ended March 31 1998 as
against RM7.52 million for the previous quarter.

up from RM618.02 million previously.
	   On the bank level, pre-tax profit improved to RM30.03 million as

	   The increase was due mainly to a reduction in the provision for

Settlers intensify campaign against West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: For AMs, UPDATES with settlers saying they will establish new
settlements if a decision is reached on a troop withdrawal  
  By KARIN LAUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing that government approval of a West Bank
troop withdrawal is imminent, Jewish settlers on Friday took senior
members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party on
flights over the disputed land in hopes of scuttling a pullback.
	   Settlers also threatened to establish at least two new Jewish
settlements if Netanyahu accepts a U.S. withdrawal proposal that
would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control
and restrict settlement expansion.
	   As a result of the withdrawal, ``the settlements are turning
into enclaves in Palestinian areas and in our view, this is a
life-and-death battle,'' said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   Under the American plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over a 12-week period, in exchange for Palestinian
security measures, such as collecting illegal weapons. Negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement would begin with the first pullback.
	   Two senior Palestinian negotiators were to brief Arafat later
Friday on their talks with the U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross.
	   Israel army radio said Ross asked the Palestinians to accept
several changes in the original U.S. proposal, but that report
could not be confirmed. A remaining sticking point is the scope of
an additional pullback promised by Israel.
	   Netanyahu wants assurances now that he will not have to hand
over more than 2 percent at the time, a demand rejected by the
Palestinians.
	   Despite continued disagreements, both Netanyahu and Arafat
seemed mildly optimistic in their assessments. Netanyahu said
Thursday that ``some progress'' had been made, while Arafat said he
was assured by U.S. mediators that a deal would be wrapped up by
mid-June.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said the prime
minister would present a withdrawal agreement to parliament, even
though he is not required to do so.
	   The plan is likely to pass with the votes of the dovish
opposition. However, far-right lawmakers have said that if
Netanyahu agrees to a withdrawal, they would try to bring him down
at the next possible opportunity by voting against the government
in a no-confidence motion.
	   Israeli media speculated Friday that faced with defections by
the far right, Netanyahu would soon try to form a national unity
government with the opposition Labor Party as a junior partner.
Such a coalition would have to be formed immediately after a
parliament vote on a troop withdrawal.
	   The Jewish settlement movement, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to
block a withdrawal.
	   On Friday, dozens of members of the Likud Central Committee were
flown across the West Bank in planes chartered by settlers trying
to persuade them to oppose any pullback as a danger to Israel's
security. Maps in hand, they were given explanations by settler
guides.
	   Settler leader Yehiel Leiter said that should the government go
ahead with a withdrawal, settlers would set up two new settlements
within 24 hours. Leiter said the protest would likely by symbolic,
with a few tents or mobile homes on West Bank hilltops.

	   SHOWER OF WASTE ... This huge spray of water caused chaos
yesterday afternoon along Jalan Kuari Cheras.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Several residents associations today
voiced their dissatisfaction over the the police decision to
withdraw a permit granted to the Federation of Malaysians Consumer
Associations for a public forum on the water problem.
	   They said there was no good reason for the decision as the
matter was of national interest and, more importantly, was not a
threat to security.
	   The forum, titled ``Krisis Air Pada Masa Kini'' (Current Water
Crisis) was to be held at the Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex at
8pm yesterday.
	   Police cited security reasons for withdrawing the permit.
	   The Selangor Menteri Besar's office also requested Fomca to
cancel the public forum.
	   Bukit Bandaraya deputy president Mumtaz Ali described the move
as strange.
	   ``They only wanted to discuss an important problem which has in
recent weeks become a national problem.
	   ``If the issue can be highlighted daily in the media, why did
the police find it necessary to revoke the permit,'' he asked.
	   Mumtaz said the forum was a platform for the people to discuss
the matter with the authorities in an appropriate manner.
	   ``We are only interested to find solutions and not to point
fingers at anyone.
	   ``Fomca is a responsible federation and it is not fair on the
part of the police to revoke the permit,'' he said.
	   There are 1.8 million consumers in 702 areas in the Klang Valley
where water supply is rationed.
	   Bangsar Baru Residents Association vice-president George Joseph
shared similar sentiments, adding that the forum was also a place
for the authorities to advise people to save water.
	   ``The forum was not only meant to discuss the water problem. It
was also to allow the relevant authorities to advise the people on
the importance of saving water,'' he said.
	   Joseph said the forum was also a meeting to allow the relevant
agencies to explain to the people the causes of the water problem
and steps being taken to address the issue.
	   ``Malaysians are very understanding people and there was no need
for the police to revoke the permit.
	   ``When you have a discourse like this, all parties will gain,''
he said.
	   Joseph said by withdrawing the permit, the people could not rule
out the possibility that the authorities were trying to ``hide
something''.
	   Kajang Jaya residents Association secretary K. Ratnam said the
forum should have been used to explain to the people the reasons
for the problem.
	   ``Some of the residents here find it rather amusing as to why
there is a sudden water shortage in certain parts of the country.''
	   Ratnam said all parties could have used the forum to their
advantage.

	   LEAVING a bank after a 10-year tenure as a treasury executive to
set up her own image consultancy, was a drastic change for Mei Foo.
Indeed, she left a secured position to set up a business which was
alien to her.
	   But her strong belief in giving her best in all that she does
has pulled her through.
	   ``It was a drastic change ... the job at the bank was
demanding,'' she told Business Times. ``It was different ... the
new job required a lot of my time and effort.
	   ``I had to do everything on my own. For the first six months, I
did everything single-handedly ... answering the phone, cleaning
the shop and servicing the clients,'' Foo said.
	   She said when people found out that she wanted to leave the bank
to start a beauty shop, she was discouraged from doing so. ``They
thought it was a `peanut' business,'' she added.
	   Foo, who is the managing director and image consultant of IEM
Studio de Beaute, had never been involved with the beauty industry.
	   ``When I was a treasury executive in a financial institution, I
had to entertain corporate clients and met many people.
	   ``Two of them happened to be from Lancome and Christian Dior.
The turning point came in 1990 when I was approached by both
Lancome and Christian Dior to start my own business.
	   ``I could not leave immediately because of the gratuity I had to
pay the company if I left but after two years, I decided to
leave,'' Foo said.
	   She decided to work with Lancome and operate an exclusive
Lancome studio. After spending six months in London and Paris,
training under Ms Anne-Marie Jouvensal, director of Lancome's
Training Centre in Paris, Foo returned home to open up her own
shop.
	   Her first studio was located at City Square in Jalan Ampang. She
opened the shop with a capital of RM50,000.
	   Then she moved to Faber Towers. Three years ago, she moved into
her own premise at Taman Desa in Jalan Klang Lama. Renovation cost
her RM250,000 for the beauty salon and another RM400,000 for the
hair salon.
	   IEM Studio de Beaute, which is now a private company with
shareholders, offers multi-sensorial facial programme, bridal
make-up, day and night make up, manicure/pedicure, and reflexology.
	   The multi-sensorial treatment programme is only available in a
handful of salons.
	   Foo believes women have to invest in themselves to feel and look
good.
	   ``For example, even if the economy is not so good, we still have
to invest in ourselves. This will enhance our self-confidence and
well-being.
	   ``In fact, due to the economic slowdown and water problems, more
people frequent the shop because they want to maintain their
looks,'' she said.
	   A member of the British Association of Beauty Therapy and
Cosmetology, Foo said that her studio at Taman Desa offers grooming
sessions for financial institutions.
	   She has already organised workshops and practical sessions for
Arthur Andersen and Hongkong Bank.
	   Her business bloomed by word of mouth. Her clients keep coming
back and often bring new customers with them.
	   ``This has to do a lot with the service at IEM. We have done
well in terms of quality service. Besides that, we update our
techniques and ensure that the environment at our shop is
comfortable,'' Foo emphasised.

Chernobyl official says sarcophagus continues to deteriorate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The concrete shell covering the ruined
nuclear reactor at Chernobyl is deteriorating and there is not
enough money to even start repairs, a plant official said Friday.
	   The dlrs 150,000 the government has provided so far this year is
not enough to even check for radiation leaks or determine what is
happening to the tons of radioactive dust and other material under
the shell, said Chernobyl deputy director Valentyn Kupny.
	   Kupny is responsible for the sarcophagus that was hastily built
over reactor No. 4 after it exploded in April 1986 in the world's
worst nuclear accident.
	   The shell continues to ``deteriorate,'' he told the Interfax
news agency.
	   Ukraine secured a dlrs 120 million grant from the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development last month for repairing the
sarcophagus. But there was no announcement as to when the funds
would be disbursed.
	   The total cost of the required repairs to the sarcophagus is
estimated at dlrs 750 million, of which Western nations have so far
contributed dlrs 387.5 million.
	   Ukraine has pledged to shut Chernobyl by 2000, but wants dlrs
1.2 billion first to complete two new nuclear reactors.

World Cup: Sheringham caught out drinking, dancing
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS with Hoddle meeting with Sheringham; adds quotes from
F.A. spokesman  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England Coach Glenn Hoddle held a closed-door
meeting Friday with striker Teddy Sheringham after front-page
photos in several newspapers showed him in a Portuguese night club
with a cigarette in his mouth and his arm around a young woman.
	   The accompanying stories said Sheringham _ one of England's top
players _ spent two straight nights in the club on the southern
Algarve coast drinking and dancing with witnesses saying he was
wobbly and staggering at 6:45 a.m.
	   Hoddle had told his players they were to spend three days at
home between breaking training camp in Spain earlier this week and
assembling in England on Friday.
	   The Sun said Sheringham followed the woman pictured in the front
page photographs into the women's toilet ``and made a pass'' at
her. The woman confirmed the incident.
	   ``Glenn Hoddle has spoken to Teddy Sheringham now that England's
World Cup squad is together again,'' F.A. spokesman David Davies
said Friday after the club reconvened.
	   ``He is establishing all the facts of the situation that was
reported in some of today's newspapers.
	   ``The players have trained this afternoon as part of their
preparations for France. Glenn and Teddy will speak again tomorrow
before any further comment is made.''
	   On Sunday, Hoddle dropped midfielder Paul Gascoigne from the
22-man team, saying he was out of shape. Gascoigne admitted at the
time he had been drunk the night before at a team party.
	   Meanwhile, one of England's greatest players _ Sir Bobby
Charlton _ ripped Sheringham.
	   ``I am really disappointed about Teddy and I hope he feels
suitably embarrassed,'' said Charlton, a director at Sheringham's
Manchester United team.
	   ``He has been given the responsibility of being one of our 22
players for the World Cup but is just not acting his age.
	   ``Any foreign media watching what has happened here in the last
couple of weeks, what with this and the Paul Gascoigne saga, would
say forget about England's chances in France because they don't
even have any self-discipline.''
	   ``Players should realize the World Cup is so important that you
cannot do anything in the few weeks leading up to the World Cup
because the media are picking up everything you do.
	   ``You are the focus of the whole country and if the players
don't have the common sense to behave themselves and act in a
reasonable manner it is absolutely nonsensical to think we have a
chance of winning it.''

Villagers rally to save well where Jack and Jill said to fetch

water  

<TEXT>
	   KILMERSDON, England (AP) _ Village legend has it that this is
the place where Jack and Jill went up that hill to fetch that pail
of water.
	   Now, an appeal has been launched to restore the water well
widely thought to have been immortalized in the popular nursery
rhyme.
	   The well, at the top of a steep hill in this small west England
town, has long been sealed over, so villagers have decided to try
to raise the cash needed to renovate the immediate area and make it
more visitor-friendly.
	   It is thought Jack and Jill were a married couple who lived in
the Kilmersdon area between 1485 and 1509.
	   Folklore has it that the pair climbed the hill, on top of which
was an area called Bad Stone from which dangerous bolders rolled,
and were killed by a runaway rock.
	   Kilmersdon Parish Council chairman Barry Fowler said the
restoration project would cost about 30,000 pounds (dlrs 48,600).
	   ``Local historians have always linked Jack and Jill to this
village,'' Fowler said. ``We have this claim to fame which is not
very well set up at the moment. We want to keep it fairly low-key,
but enhance it so people and especially children can enjoy it.''

Foreign Office advises Britons to leave Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Foreign Office on Friday advised British
citizens in Eritrea to leave the east African state as soon as
possible because of a worsening border conflict between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.
	   ``We're now strongly advising British nationals to leave
Eritrea,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said. ``We are working
closely with our European Union partners and the Canadians and
Americans to make the necessary provision for flights out of the
capital Asmara as soon as possible,'' the spokesman, speaking on
terms of customary anonymity, said.
	   The Foreign Office believes about 120 Britons are currently in
Eritrea.
	   Two Ethiopian military aircraft Friday twice bombed an Eritrean
air force base in the capital Asmara over a border dispute between
the two nations. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said the strike was
in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on Mekele, 200 kilometers
(125 miles) north of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed easier
yesterday on selling of selected blue-chip counters.
	   The market had earlier in the morning extended its uptrend as
sentiment was encouraged by the country's positive trade surplus of
RM12.4 billion from January to April this year, on the back of an
increase of 43 per cent in exports.
	   Gains were later erased when the market reacted cautiously to
the announcement on funding for Asset Management Company (AMC) set
up to manage non-performing loans (NPL).
	   Volume will remain thin and any rebound on the bourse is
expected to be transient on worries on the shrinking local and
regional economies, analysts added.
	   The KLCI was down 7.75 points to 518.61 compared with

A ring and some memories added to women's final
</HEADLINE>
  By SALVATORE ZANCA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The ring dancing around her neck and the black
outfit are signs it will be a special match for Monica Seles when
she meets Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the women's final Saturday.
	   On May 14, Seles was at her father's side when he died in
Sarasota, Fla., after a five-year battle with cancer.
	   Now Seles is back in the final of the French Open, the
tournament where she won her first Grand Slam title in 1990 with
her father in the stands.
	   After Seles beat Steffi Graf in the final eight years ago, Seles
raced to the player's box and to her father, Karolj, who kissed the
red tie he was wearing and handed it to his daughter.
	   Now Seles is wearing another momento from her father, a ring
that bounces around her neck on a chain as she hits the ball.
	   She came to Paris to play in the French Open, her first
tournament since her dad's death, because she couldn't bear staying
in a house that holds memories of him in every corner.
	   ``My dad just wanted me to do what I wanted to do. Tennis is one
of the things that I love to do. He was the one who started me with
it,'' Seles said. ``I miss him tremendously.''
	   Her father was with her when she won the title again in 1991 and
1992. But her career was interrupted when a crazed fan stabbed her
during a match in Germany in 1993.
	   Seles said it has been tough to concentrate on tennis since her
return to competition in August 1995.
	   ``When there's so many things going on outside your life it's
difficult to keep my mind talking about life and things, then go on
a tennis court and be really excited about hitting a ball,'' she
said.
	   She has had only patches of brilliance in the past two years, as
her father's illness weighed on her. She missed this year's
Australian Open, and advanced to the semifinals of only one of four
tournaments this year before the French Open.
	   At the French Open, though, Seles has seemed like her old
dominating self. In the semifinals, she beat top-seeded Martina
Hingis 6-3, 6-2.
	   She credits new coach Gavin Hopper with changing her. Until
shortly before his death, Karolj Seles was her only coach.
	   ``Gavin has just helped me so much in my tennis game, my
off-court game, just really mentally, too,'' Seles said. ``We just
work very well together. We have the same goals, the same
philosophy. He reminds me a lot of my dad, how he is with his two
daughters.''
	   Seles is 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario, including a 6-3, 6-4 win
in the 1991 French Open final. But Seles quickly points to the last
time they played, at the WTA Championships in November, when
Sanchez Vicario won in three sets.
	   Sanchez Vicario advanced to Saturday's final with a victory over
an error-plagued Lindsay Davenport.
	   ``I knew we were both very nervous, but I did probably handled
it better at the end. I was able to get the ball into the court and
she made some mistakes,'' Sanchez Vicario said.
	   Sanchez Vicario won the French title in 1989 and 1994. When she
shocked Graf in 1989, the German's only Grand Slam loss between
1988 and 1989, the Spaniard was the youngest woman to win a major
title at 17 years, five months. Seles eclipsed that the following
year, winning the French Open title at 16 1/2.

	   EDARAN Otomobil Nasional Bhd (EON) expects the current economic
environment to be a temporary setback to the group's passenger car
division as the business is highly resilient.
	   In his annual statement, chairman Datuk Wira Mohd Saleh Sulong
says although the Malaysian Motor Traders Association expects
passenger cars to plunge by almost 60 per cent to 130,000 units for
1998, there are indications that the market will pick up in the
coming months.
	   He points out that ``in the motor business, our marquee is well
established and needs no introduction as EON has the most extensive
and modern sales network'', adding that this inherent strength will
put EON in good stead to face the challenges ahead.
	   Saleh says the EON group, being one of the largest conglomerates
in the country, has the staying power to weather the economic
downturn.
	   On the group's other core business, he says government measures
to regulate loan growth in the banking industry are expected to
slow down growth in the group's banking and financial services
sector.
	   He also points out that on February 18 this year, there was a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between subsidiary EON Finance
Bhd, Credit Corp (Malaysia) Bhd and Suria Mahsuri Sdn Bhd (Mahsuri)
in relation to the proposed merger of the two finance companies;
while on March 26, MOUs were signed between Mahsuri and the
respective shareholders of Cempaka Finance Bhd and City Finance Bhd
for the proposed acquisition of a 100 per cent equity stake in both
the companies.
	   Mahsuri has also signed a MOU with Safuan Group Bhd for the
proposed acquisition of a 95.15 per cent equity interest in Perkasa
Finance Bhd.
	   Meanwhile for the year ended December 31 1997, EON's group
pre-tax profit shed 4.9 per cent to RM669.66 million from RM704.05
million in the previous corresponding period.
	   The drop in profit was attributed to the decline in pre-tax
earnings of the group's motor operations to RM566.1 million from
RM585.2 million previously and to the lower pre-tax profits
recorded by EON's banking and financial services sector.
	   Pre-tax profits of RM72.1 million registered by this sector
during the year under review was 23.1 per cent lower than in 1996,
as the EON Bank Group had to comply with the revised Bank Negara
guidelines on loan provisions in the face of the prevailing
economic conditions, Saleh says.
	   The group's turnover for the year, however, rose 1.5 per cent to
RM7.39 billion from RM7.28 billion the last time around. After-tax
profit for the year dropped to RM442.87 million from RM476.03
million previously.
	   Profit attributable to shareholders fell 5.5 per cent to
RM429.20 million in 1997 against RM454.43 million recorded a year
earlier.
	   Accordingly, earnings per share fell to 1.89 sen from 2.01 sen
the last time around.
	   Directors have recommended a final dividend of 30 sen per share
less tax to be paid on June 25, together with an interim dividend
of 15 sen per share less tax which was paid on October 23 last
year.

UN inspectors seek to rally Security Council support
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: CORRECTS date of Butler's talks in Baghdad  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq agreed Friday to work with U.N. arms
inspectors ``to finalize work quickly'' to ending sanctions but
rejected a ``road map'' of disarmanent steps which the chief
inspector will carry to Baghdad next week.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler travels to Iraq next week to
spell out specific measures Iraq must take so the U.N. Special
Commission can certify that Iraq is free of illegal weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the Security Council to lift
sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Guld War.
	   Following a two-day briefing to the council, Butler said
Thursday that experts have nearly accounted for all Iraqi chemical
artillery shells but ``fairly large gaps'' remain in other weapons
areas.
	   He said he was taking along a ``road map'' of specific measures.
They include release of documents pertaining to Iraq's long-range
missiles as well as chemical and biological weapons production.
	   During a press conference, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Baghdad was prepared to work with the
commission and the Security Council based on a ``professional,
scientific and technical approach which confines itself to the
requirements of disarmanent.''
	   But he said the inspectors ``keep insisting on the same
`non-starter' approach of casting doubts, building their
understanding on assumptions, suspicions and not on facts and
figures,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all illegal weapons but that the
United States and Britain are manipulating the commission to
maintain sanctions indefinitely.
	   Al-Sahhaf's remarks indicate the Iraqis still insist that the
inspectors should simply verify what Baghdad has already disclosed
about its weapons programs, accepting Iraqi declarations as fact.
	   The inspectors claim they have the authority to conduct more
far-reaching inspections and not simply base their estimates of
Iraqi capabilities on information Baghdad has supplied.
	   ``A `road map' is something that shows the way from `Point A' to
`Point B,''' said an Iraqi source on condition of anonymity. ``We
say we are already at `Point B.'''
	   That raises doubts whether the Iraqis will be prepared to
provide new documentation when they meet Butler in Baghdad on June
13-14.

World Cup: Norwegians happy with first workout
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHAN NASSTROM  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ High intensity and superb team spirit.
With only one player not fully fit, Norway's World Cup squad staged
its first training session Friday on a pitch surrounded by police
and media.
	   ``I've seen better practices by our team, but I also saw some
that were a lot worse,'' Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen said
later after the 90-minute session during the ``Open House'' held at
the team hotel.
	   ``On a scale from one to 10, this was an eight or a nine when it
comes to the quality of practice.''
	   Goalkeeper Frode Grodaas of Tottenham, one of the squad's 11
players based in England, agreed.
	   ``It was a very good workout,'' he said. ``The atomosphere was
very good. The team spirit is one of the biggest strengths on this
side.''
	   Olsen, whose team has fellow World Cup sides Denmark, Mexico and
Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2 in its final World Cup exhibitions,
arrived a day late to its training camp near Nantes. He watched
Morocco, Norway's first Group A opponent, play Chile at a 1-1 draw
Thursday in another exhibition in southern France.
	   ``Morocco did not play well,'' Olsen said. ``Yet I think they
were better than Chile.''
	   ``There are no easy matches in the World Cup, but I think we
have a good schedule. If I had the chance to choose, I would never
have picked Brazil in the opening game.''
	   Brazil, the defending champion, is Norway's last opponent. The
other is Scotland. Norway is one of the few teams without a loss
against Brazil, the last a stunning 4-2 victory in Oslo last year
over Ronaldo and company. The other match, also played in Norway,
ended 1-1 in 1988.
	   Olsen said the loss of Romario _ the 32-year-old hero of the
1994 Cup who was cut from the team on Tuesday because of a calf
injury _ probably wouldn't hurt the Brazilians that much.
	   ``I don't think it will mean so much,'' Olsen said. ``The
Brazilians have so many good players. And Romario has not played so
well lately.''
	   Norway didn't make the second round four years ago in only its
second trip to the World Cup finals. But with 12 veterans returning
and most of the players based abroad in some of Europe's top
leagues _ only five on the 22-man squad play in Norway _ the
experience from high-level competition is there.
	   Few teams can boast a better record than Norway, which went
unbeaten through the qualifying stage and has nine victories and
five draws since its last loss early in 1997 at Australia.
	   Some people in neighboring Sweden even suggested that the
Swedes' bronze medal in the '94 Cup would be a bigger surprise than
if Norway finishes third in this tournament.
	   ``I'm not so sure about that,'' Olsen said. ``We don't have the
same soccer tradition. After all, Sweden has more tradition in
soccer than Norway. I think it would be a big, big surprise if we
win the bronze medal.
	   ``I don't think it's impossible, but to achieve it we have to be
lucky in the early going. In a potential knockout situation, we're
very good and can beat any team in the world.''
	   Oyvind Leonhardsen, a midfielder who plays for Liverpool,
sustained a strained leg muscle injury recently but took part in
Friday's practice session.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Desmond Tutu made a final bid to
extract an apology from apartheid's last hard-line president on
Friday, ending a week of courtroom drama over ultimate
responsibility for atrocities under South African white rule.
	   The Nobel Laureate and retired Anglican archbishop, who was for
decades the moral spokesman against apartheid, asked former
President P.W. Botha to apologize for the bombings and killings of
black activists.
	   ``The government that he headed caused many of our people deep
deep anguish and suffering,'' Tutu said. ``Can he bring himself to
say he's sorry?''
	   Botha sat stonefaced during Tutu's speech, as he has during most
of the week that saw a simple contempt case turn into a moral
inquest. Since apartheid ended with the first democratic elections
in 1994, Botha has insisted he has nothing to apologize for.
	   Botha, 82, is charged with ignoring three subpoenas to appear
before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is probing
atrocities committed during white rule.
	   But the case has focused on allegations that Botha and the
shadowy State Security Council he headed coordinated a crackdown on
anti-apartheid activists and directly ordered bombings and killings
during the 1980s.
	   Grilling Tutu, who heads the Truth Commission, defense lawyer
Lappe Laubscher said there were no direct assassination orders in
any of the council's minutes, indicating the killings were the work
of ``bad apples'' in the police and army who misunderstood orders.
	   An angry Tutu objected.
	   ``How many 'bad apples' are you going to concede?'' he asked.
``No, no. We cannot now say that these are 'bad apples.' They are
people who were sitting on the State Security Council.''
	   The case was adjourned until June 15, when both sides will
summarize their findings. Botha faces a hefty fine or even two
years in prison if convicted.
	   Afterward, Botha had an animated and angry conversation with
prosecutor Bruce Morrison out of hearing distance of reporters.
	   He then turned to reporters, citing three books they should read
to understand his point of view, including his biography, ``Voice
from the Wilderness.'' He refused further comment.
	   Prosecution witnesses, including police death squad commander
Eugene de Kock, testified earlier this week that the council's use
of phrases like eliminate'' and ``neutralize'' sanctioned the
murder of the white-run state's opponents.
	   Botha and other top members of the SSC claim the words meant
opponents should be arrested.
	   Botha has been implicated by testimony elsewhere by top police
officials, who have claimed he gave direct orders for violent acts.
	   After Botha's 11 years as head of state, his successor,
President F.W. de Klerk, negotiated with the group that spearheaded
the anti-apartheid struggle, President Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress.
	   The talks culminated in the 1994 elections won by the ANC.

World Cup: Denmark's third defeat in a row when Cameroon defeats
</HEADLINE>
them 2-1 at home  

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Francois Omam Biyick's headers Friday
gave Cameroon a 2-1 win over Denmark, which continued its string of
losses in World Cup preparatory matches.
	   Biyick opened the score in the 15th minute when he headed a long
ball over goalie Peter Schmeichel. Eight minutes later he turned in
a second goal on a corner shot.
	   ``We are ready for the World Cup ... or maybe not totally
ready,'' Denmark's coach Bo Johansson said after the entertaining
and high-pace game. ``We need to strengten the defense,'' he added.
	   Cameroon, which met the Danes for the first time, controlled the
first half and had several opportunities to increase the score.
While the Danish forwards had numerous chances, their defense was
weak and disorganized.
	   Struggling hard before 40,564 stunned fans, the Danes failed to
score due to a combination of a tight Cameroonian defense, a flying
Jacques Songo'o in goal, and sheer bad luck.
	   Peter Moeller who came in as a substitute for Michael Laudrup,
shot twice on the post. But it wasn't until his third attempt in
the 90th minute that he managed to head a low ball past Songo'o.
	   Laudrup, one of Denmark's best players, bid farewell to his fans
at home _ he will quit soccer after the World Cup, his second in 16
years on the team.
	   Schmeichel, who played his 100th game for the Danish side, was
substituted in the second half because of a minor injury. He was
replaced by Mogens Krogh.
	   It was Denmark's third consecutive loss before flying to France.
In the past two months, they lost 0-2 to Sweden and 0-2 to Norway.
	   Denmark: Peter Schmeichel, Thomas Helveg, Jes Hoegh, Marc
Rieper, Jan Heintze, Martin Joergensen, Morten Wieghorst, Rene

Poland's bishops approve Internet server project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Roman Catholic bishops on Friday approved
a project to set up an Internet server linking all dioceses of
Poland's largest church, the state news agency reported.
	   The Rev. Jozef Kloch said that ``before the pope's visit and
before the jubilee year 2000, the church in Poland will have a
modern network of communication and information.''
	   Pope John Paul II, who was born in Poland, has been invited to
visit next year.
	   Kloch heads a foundation established Friday to carry out the
project, called the Tower of Strength. A Polish computer firm,
Optimus S.A., and Bank PKO S.A. will be partners in the project.
	   Internet users within the church suggested the server idea six
months ago, Kloch said. Sixteen of the nation's 39 dioceses already
have their own Internet connections, started by local users.
	   About 95 percent of Poland's 39 million people are Roman
Catholic.

Pakistan promises restraint, but won't fall behind India

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Faced with a demand for nuclear
restraint, Pakistan promised Friday to act responsibly but said it
won't allow itself to fall behind neighboring rival India.
	   ``While we will not provoke escalation, our responses will be
carefully calibrated to respond to any provocation or escalation by
India,'' said a government statement.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of the five established
nuclear powers called on India and Pakistan to step back from the
brink of nuclear confrontation after both tested atomic devices
last month.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was quoted as telling a close
meeting of legislators that the action by the five ministers opened
the best opportunity for India and Pakistan to begin talking about
their problems.
	   The Pakistani statement did not address the specifics of the
foreign ministers' demand to refrain from deploying nuclear
weapons, conducting more missile tests or producing fissile
material.
	   A Clinton administration official said Thursday there was
evidence that Pakistan could soon test fire the Tarmuk missile,
with a range of 400 to 600 kilometers (250-375 miles), in what
would be seen as a further escalation of regional tension.
	   However, a Foreign Ministry spokesman denied the report, calling
it ``part of a disinformation campaign,'' said a report by the
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan.
	   In its statement, Pakistan did not say it would consider joining
the nonproliferation regimes that have kept a lid on the spread of
nuclear technology. India calls those treaties discriminatory since
they do not ask the nuclear powers to disarm. Pakistan says it will
sign them only if India does.
	   ``We will continue, 6th graf pvs.

Japanese military chief visits Far Eastern port
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS new penultimate graf with Russia to comment on Kuril
Islands proposal.  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The navies of Russia, Japan and the United States
could in the future hold joint rescue and salvage exercises, the
chairman of Japan's Joint Chiefs of Staff predicted Friday.
	   Adm. Kazuya Natsukawa spoke in the Far Eastern port of
Vladivostok, the main base of Russia's Pacific Fleet and the last
stop on his eight-day trip to boost military cooperation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto pledged last fall to increase military contacts as part
of effort to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
	   Natsukawa said plans are already in the works for the first
Russian-Japanese naval exercises, to be held in July. The Russian
and U.S. navies have previously held joint exercises, and Natsukawa
predicted the three countries could train together some time, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   In Vladivostok, Natsukawa was to meet with regional officials
and visit the Admiral Vinogradov anti-submarine ship. On Saturday,
he is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Pacific Fleet Combat Glory
memorial to Russian victims of two wars fought against Japan this
century.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of a dispute over four islands in the
Kuril chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of the war.
	   Russia will make a ``preliminary comment'' on Japanese proposals
on the Kuril Islands dispute next month, Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin told the Interfax news agency. Japanese media say
Tokyo proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing
Russian to retain control for some time.
	   Natsukawa is scheduled to return to Japan on Sunday.

Pantani stays ahead while Fagnini wins 20th Giro stage
</HEADLINE>
  EDs: UPDATES with details, quotes  

<TEXT>
	   MENDRISIO, Switzerland (AP) _ Marco Pantani held onto his lead
Friday in the Tour of Italy while fellow Italian Gian Matteo
Fagnini clinched his first stage victory.
	   Close on Pantani's heels, 1 minute, 28 seconds behind, is
Russia's Pavel Tonkov, the 1996 Giro winner. The two rode together
slightly behind the lead pack Friday to save energy for Saturday's
34-kilometer (21-mile) individual time trial.
	   Tonkov is expected to defeat Pantani, who is a climbing
specialist, in the time trial, and victory will come down to the
final seconds.
	   ``We are both already thinking of tomorrow's race which will be
decisive,'' Pantani said. ``I am sure Tonkov will do all he can to
win so it will be tough.''
	   In a slightly longer time trial last week, Tonkov beat Pantani
by just over two minutes. However, both racers are now fatigued
from 20 days of riding and Saturday is expected to be another
scorching hot day.
	   The 22-stage Giro ends Sunday in Milan.
	   Fagnini won the day's stage -- 137 kilometers (85 miles) from
Boario Terme, Italy, to Mendrisio, Switzerland -- in three hours,
31 minutes and 29 seconds. Fagnini pulled ahead in the final meters
(yards) of the race with a powerful sprint, finishing just a
bicycle-length ahead of the lead pack.
	   Pantani, 28, who was sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a
broken leg, took over the leader's pink jersey from Switzerland's
Alex Zuelle during a mountain stage Tuesday and has held onto it
ever since.
	   ``The fact that I am the one wearing the pink jersey will
certainly help me psychologically,'' Pantani said. ``But we'll just
have to wait for tomorrow's verdict.''
	   Zuelle, who dominated the Tour in its initial stages and was
considered favorite to win, slid back dozens of positions after
Thursday's 239-kilometer (148-mile) ride up steep mountain roads in
excessive heat.

Defendants in killing of American child convicted in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANZARO, Italy (AP) _ A court Friday sentenced one man to life
in prison and his accomplice to 20 years for the 1994 highway
slaying of a 7-year-old American boy.
	   An appeals court convicted Michele Iannello, 30, and sentenced
him to life in prison, and handed Franco Mesiano, 25, a 20-year
term.
	   The men had been acquitted of murder, attempted murder and armed
robbery in January 1997 in this southern city, but the prosecution
sought their re-trial, as is possible under Italian law.
	   The boy, Nicholas Green, was killed by gunfire during a robbery
attempt as he and his family drove down a Calabrian highway while
on vacation.
	   The crime drew nationwide attention, and his parents became
symbols of charity when they parents, from Bodega Bay, California,
donated his organs to save seven other lives. The decision inspired
a temporary surge of organ donations in a country where the
practice is relatively rare.
	   Tumult filled the courtroom after the sentences were announced,
the ANSA and AGI news agencies reported. Family members of the
defendants wept and embraced them.
	   ``Tell the mother of Nicholas that after her son, now there is
another innocent victim who is paying for this matter, which I'm
not guilty of,'' Mesiano told reporters, according to ANSA.
	   Iannello, who has separately admitted four gangland murders,
also had denied involvement.
	   The prosecution said statements recorded by telephone taps
implicated the pair, but the defense disputed the meaning of the
conversations in dialect.
	   The prosecution contends that the discovery of a pistol in the
home of Iannello's mother after the first trial questioned the
credibility of the defendant, who had testified he had no other
weapons.

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>
  URGENT  
  Eds: Combines urgent series; updates with quotes from promoter,
background on hepatitis, background on woman being scratched
because of pregnancy test.  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Henry Akinwande has tested positive for
hepatitis B and was ruled ineligible to fight heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield on Saturday.
	   The finding came in two separate medical tests conducted by the
New York State Athletic Commission, said Greg Fritz, a spokesman
for Don King Productions, the promoter of the fight.
	   ``The fight is off,'' Fritz said Friday.
	   The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
	   Hepatitis B and C cause serious liver problems. Hepatitis A is
typically a food-borne disease that can pass quickly. Hepatitis B,
often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic needles, can be
successfully treated, but not always.
	   The Showtime network, which was to televise the bout from
Madison Square Garden, also said in a statement that the main event
had been canceled due to the commission's finding that Akinwande
had tested positive for hepatitis B.
	   It was not immediately clear how the undercard bouts would be
affected. Showtime planned an announcement later Friday.
	   Heavyweight Ray Mercer, who was to fight on the undercard
against Jerry Ballard, also was suspended for medical reasons, said
Ralph Petrillo, medical coordinator for the athletic commission.
	   Petrillo said Akinwande was under a medical suspension, but he
declined to elaborate.
	   They were the second and third medical suspensions to hit
Saturday's card.
	   On Friday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because tests
showed she was pregnant.
	   Melissa Salamore was to have replaced Garcia, but Martin
rejected her as an opponent and promoters were trying to find
someone else to replace her.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to his career. He was
disqualified during a bout against WBC champ Lennox Lewis in July
for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was fighting for a piece of the title for the
second time in less than a year was due more to his choice of
promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle, promoter Don
King matched him against Orlin Norris, Jr., and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included 46-year-old
Roberto Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a
decision in Panama in his last fight after getting knocked down in
the first round.

53 killed in three days of factional fighting in Somalia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The death toll in three days of
factional fighting for control of a strategic town northwest of
Mogadishu rose to 56 Friday.
	   At least 18 people were reported killed in battles in Baidoa
Friday between the Rahanwein Resistance Army and militiamen loyal
to faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid, according to residents
contacted by high frequency radio.
	   Baidoa50 kilometers (93 miles) from Mogadishu, said residents
contacted through high frequency radio.
	   The residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the RRA
broke through Aidid's defenses during the night and fighting raged
in the streets of Baidoa, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of
Mogadishu.
	   Sources close to Aidid, who controls southern Mogadishu, said
RRA militiamen were later pushed back to the outskirts of Baidoa,
but RRA sources denied the claim.
	   RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle told journalists in
Mogadishu Thursday the Rahanwein attacked Aidid's militiamen first
on charges they were robbing local people.
	   Baidoa is one of the few Somali towns with a functioning airport
and economy.
	   Last December, Aidid and 23 faction leaders agreed to hold a
national reconciliation conference in Baidoa. The RRA and others
said they would not attend unless Aidid withdrew his militia, which
he has not done.
	   The conference, first scheduled for Feb. 15, has been postponed
three times, the last time indefinitely.
	   Somalia has had no central government since clan-based faction
leaders combined to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January
1991, then turned on each other as the country disintegrated into
fiefdoms protected by private militias.

	   NAM Fatt Corp Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary, PN Construction
Sdn Bhd, expects to reap about HK$140 million (HK$100    RM52.60)
from the disposal of the entire stake in Bout Holdings Ltd to Gold
Heights International Ltd for HK$240 million cash.
	   The entire stake in Bout comprises 101.44 million shares of HK$1
each.
	   Bout, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, owns 75 per cent
stake in Long Island Golf and Country Club Ltd; 75 per cent equity
in Dongguan Changan Jinyu Golf Club Co Ltd; and 75 per cent stake
in Top Smart International Development Ltd.
	   However, Nam Fatt is expected to realise a loss of about RM6
million from the disposal after taking into account the realisation
of post- acquisition earnings for the year ending December 31 1998.
	   In a statement, Nam Fatt said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nam
Fatt Hong Kong, has proposed to enter into a service agreement with
Gold Heights or its nominee, whereby Gold Heights or its nominee
will appoint Nam Fatt Hong Kong as a project
consultant-cum-integrated manager for a new recreation-cum-golf
course development and the provision of management services.
	   This is within a period of five years after the completion of
the proposed disposal for a remuneration of HK$80 million.
	   It said the interest savings to be derived from the proceeds of
the proposed disposal and the management fee to be earned within a
period of five years of the service agreement are expected to
contribute to Nam Fatt's current and future earnings.
	   It added that the proceeds raised from the proposed disposal
will provide additional working capital for Nam Fatt's activities
and for venturing into other future investments.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Friday he plans to
discuss Russia's relations with Germany ``until the year 2000''
when he meets Chancellor Helmut Kohl next week.
	   The two leaders are scheduled to meet in Bonn on Monday and
Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin said he expects to discuss political, financial, trade
and social issues on his first foreign trip since a financial
crisis sent stock markets tumbling.
	   He said the main focus will be the bilateral relationship.
	   ``It is not simple,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``It was developed with difficulties and it will be more
difficult for us to advance it.''

US government offers dlrs 2 million reward for killer of Americans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The U.S. government advertised a dlrs
2 million reward Friday in Pakistani newspapers and promised
protection to informants about the killers of four American oil
company workers.
	   The four employees of Union Texas Petroleum and their Pakistan
driver were shot Nov. 12 as their car inched along in a traffic jam
in the Pakistani city of Karachi.
	   The three-column advertisement in major newspapers offered the
reward for information leading to the arrest of those who carried
out ``this cowardly attack on innocent civilians.''
	   The identity of the informants would be protected, and they
could be relocated, it said.
	   The shooting was linked to the conviction two days earlier of
Pakistani national Mir Aimal Kasiby in a U.S. court for murder in
the 1993 shooting spree outside the headquarters of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
	   A group calling itself the Aimal Secret Committee took
responsibility for the shooting of the Union Texas employees.
Several people were later questioned, but no arrests have been
reported.
	   Kasi's capture in Pakistan in a joint FBI-Pakistani operation
incensed many Pakistanis, who objected to his being whisked out of
the country without an extradition hearing. Tribesmen from his
desert hometown of Quetta swore to avenge the capture.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Peter Claussen said the ad was published
under a worldwide U.S. government program that sets a dlrs 2
million maximum reward in such cases.
	   Claussen said it had been in the works for several months, but
was delayed by the crush of work recently after India and Pakistan
tested nuclear devices last month.
	   The embassy offered a similar reward once before in the case of
a fatal shooting of two U.S. diplomats in March 1995. Claussen
refused to say if that advertisement yieldeded any leads, but said
the investigation is still open.
	   Americans have been targeted several times in the turbulent
history of U.S.-Pakistan relations, beginning with the 1979 burning
of the embassy by Islamic activists. Two Americans and two
Pakistanis were killed in that incident.
	   Tw months ago, the embassy issued warnings of a potential threat
to U.S. facilities and initiated tight security precautions.

Estonians charge Russian pensioners with inciting ethnic hatred
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Two Russian women were charged Friday
with trying to incite ethnic hatred between Estonians and
Russian-speakers.
	   The women _ Esya Shur, 64, and Lidiya Kashnova, 63 _ had made
inflammatory statements at a rally last year, said police spokesman
Hannes Kont. He said he did not know the details of the rally or
what the women allegedly said.
	   The women, both of whom live in Estonia but hold Russian
citizenship, are known as hardline activists in Estonia's
Russian-speaking community, Kont said. About 30 percent of the
country's residents are Russian-speakers.
	   Many ethnic Russians claim Estonia's policies on citizenship are
aimed at disenfranchising them, a complaint also levelled by
Russians in the other former Soviet Baltic states.
	   In April, the Russian government lashed out at Latvia for
alleged discrimination against its ethnic Russians, threatening
trade sanctions unless the country relaxed its citizenship laws.
	   Russia's complaint came after Latvian police roughly broke up a
demonstration of mostly Russian-speaking pensioners.
	   Kont said the arrest of the two pension-aged Russian women in
Estonia could be a sensitive issue, but said it was necessary
because investigators had concluded the law had been violated.

EU nominates German as development bank boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers Friday
unanimously endorsed the nomination of Germany's Horst Koehler as
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
	   Koehler's appointment is now largely a formality, since the 15
EU nations have a majority of votes on the board of the
London-based bank which channels Western aid to nations of the
former Soviet bloc.
	   The European bloc has been unable to agree on a head for the
bank since January, when Frenchman Jacques Delarosiere stepped
down. Since then, the bank has been run by Charles Frank, its
American vice president.
	   Agreement on Koehler came after Spain withdrew its candidate,
former finance minister Pedro Solbes.
	   Koehler is a former a state secretary at the German Finance
Ministry and was Chancellor Helmut Kohl's envoy at meetings of the
Group of Seven industrialized countries. He has been president of
the Association of German Savings Banks since 1993.
	   The EBRD was set up in 1991 to promote the transition towards
market-oriented economies in 26 countries in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. It has a capital base of dlrs 20 billion.

Ukraine: Just seven millionaires?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - If you believe income tax filings, Ukraine
has only seven millionaires, the chief of the state tax service
said Friday.
	   Believe it? He doesn't.
	   The tax chief, Nikolai Azarov, said only seven people submitted
papers showing annual income of more than a million hryvna (dlrs
500,000), the Interfax news agency reported.
	   That's not very many in a nation of 50 million people,
especially one whose capital residents have grown used to the sight
of ``new Ukrainians'' cruising about in fancy cars, wearing
designer clothes.
	   The truth? Azarov estimated that 150,000 people in the former
Soviet republic earned more than a million hryvna last year _ and
about 147,993 failed to report it.

Federico Garcia Lorca: small-town poet with worldwide following
</HEADLINE>
  By MAR ROMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   FUENTEVAQUEROS, Spain (AP) _ A torrential rain fell Friday over
the white-painted village where 100 years ago Spain's
most-translated poet Federico Garcia Lorca was born.
	   The outdoor centennial gala was suspended, but the village has
long remembered its most famous son without the need of official
extravaganzas.
	   ``Federico is like one of the family,'' said Celia Ramos, who
has a portrait of Lorca hanging in her living room.
	   The villagers claim a personal link to Lorca, who was killed in
1936 by Gen. Francisco Franco's Nationalist troops during the
opening days of the Spanish Civil War. Here he is known simply as
Federico.
	   ``Federico was an excellent person with a very good sense of
humor, although he was also a clumsy and rather fearful child,''
recalled Ramos, 58, repeating the words of her aunt and his nanny,
Carmen Ramos.
	   Like the majority of the 4,000 villagers, Ramos can recite some
of Lorca's poems by heart. She has read little of his work.
	   ``Because of Franco we didn't know about the great talent of
Federico,'' said Amparo Garcia, 82, a distant relative, ``The
foreigners who came to the town knew more than we did''.
	   Relegated to the cultural shadows during Franco's 40-year
regime, the first anniversary was not celebrated in Fuentevaqueros
until 1976, a year after the dictator died.
	   Residents recall police watching from the rooftops as the crowd
wept when one of the poet's nephews shouted ``Federico lives! He is
still with us.''
	   The Spanish cultural mainstream no longer fears the poet's
compassion for the poor, and 1998 has been designated ``Lorca
year.''
	   New and reprinted biographies fill the stores, while Lorca's
plays dominate the country's theater programs.
	   A member of the artistic vanguard _ a friend of surrealist
painter Salvador Dali and filmmaker Luis Bunuel _ Lorca was
fascinated by love, death, motherhood, cruelty, violence, simple
humanity and sexuality.
	   Lorca's own homosexuality, outcried by the Franco, is still
controversial today among the villagers.
	   ``I don't believe it'' said Ramos.
	   Lorca frequently returned to Fuentevaqueros for inspiration and
refuge, and on Friday, surviving relatives and friends gathered in
the village surrounded by tobacco fields and orchards.
	   His sister Isabel sent a telegram to the mayor apologizing for
her absence caused by ``the emotion.''
	   Celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, 38
years from now, threaten to be even more emotional although less
easy to organize. The exact date and place of his murder are still
a mystery.

UN inspectors seek to rally Security Council support
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Iraq agreeing to work with UNSCOM but
rejects ``road map,'' TRIMS  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq agreed Friday to work with U.N. arms
inspectors ``to finalize work quickly'' and end sanctions but
rejected a ``road map'' of disarmanent steps which the chief
inspector will carry to Baghdad next week.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler travels to Iraq next week to
spell out specific measures Iraq must take so the U.N. Special
Commission can certify that Iraq is free of illegal weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the Security Council to lift
sanctions imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf War.
	   Following a two-day briefing to the council, Butler said
Thursday that experts have nearly accounted for all Iraqi chemical
artillery shells but ``fairly large gaps'' remain in other weapons
areas.
	   He said he was taking along a ``road map'' of specific measures.
They include release of documents pertaining to Iraq's long-range
missiles as well as chemical and biological weapons production.
	   During a press conference, Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Baghdad was prepared to work with the
commission and the Security Council based on a ``professional,
scientific and technical approach which confines itself to the
requirements of disarmanent.''
	   But he said the inspectors ``keep insisting on the same
`non-starter' approach of casting doubts, building their
understanding on assumptions, suspicions and not on facts and
figures,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all illegal weapons but that the
United States and Britain are manipulating the commission to
maintain sanctions indefinitely.
	   Al-Sahhaf's remarks indicate the Iraqis still insist that the
inspectors should simply verify what Baghdad has already disclosed
about its weapons programs, accepting Iraqi declarations as fact.
	   The inspectors claim they have the authority to conduct more
far-reaching inspections and not simply base their estimates of
Iraqi capabilities on information Baghdad has supplied.
	   ``A `road map' is something that shows the way from `Point A' to
`Point B,''' said an Iraqi source on condition of anonymity. ``We
say we are already at `Point B.'''
	   That raises doubts whether the Iraqis will be prepared to
provide new documentation when they meet Butler in Baghdad on June
13-14.
	   ``It's really just an excuse to ask for a new slogan, that of
access to documents,'' Amir al-Saadi, an Iraqi presidential
adviser. ``All the documents relevant to disarmanent have been
provided.''
	   Butler's two-day briefing to the council was aimed at easing
pressure from France, Russia and China to justify his claims that
Iraq may still be holding illegal weapons.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's briefing proved
that ``Iraq is deceiving ... the Security Council'' and ``this must
stop if it expects to get sanctions lifted.''
	   U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
briefing was part of a ``power struggle'' within the council
between the Americans and Britons _ who have been strongly critical
of Iraq _ and the Russians, French and Chinese who have been
sympathetic to Baghdad's position.
	   Those five countries are permanent council members and have
strongly entrenched positions regarding Iraq. Each faction is
trying to win support among the 10 non-permanent members.

Mixed reactions from euro ministers on deficit-reduction proposal
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL AMES  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers gave a mixed
reaction Friday to a proposal for them to use the benefits of
Europe's quickening economic recovery to finance further cuts in
budget deficits.
	   EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy made the call
Thursday for the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their common
currency on Jan. 1 to set an average deficit target of 2 percent of
gross domestic product this year, and 1.5 percent in 1999.
	   ``We have to take advantage of the favorable economic
situation,'' de Silguy told reporters Friday. ``We are in a period
of sustained growth in Europe ... don't relax the efforts to reduce
public deficits.''
	   The 11 euro group ministers said they needed more time to digest
the proposals and would look at them again in July. But as they met
Friday with ministers from the four EU nations staying outside the
euro-zone, reactions were luke warm.
	   ``There is no room for maneuver,'' said French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. ``There is no change in the (French
deficit) forecast.''
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said de Silguy's proposal
was ``very positive,'' but Germany officials said they had no plans
to reduce the deficit from the 2.2 percent forecast for 1998 and
the 2 percent expected next year.
	   Belgian, Italian and Spanish ministers said their deficits could
well be below current forecasts.
	   But Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt insisted the EU's
executive Commission could not expect them to use extra revenue
coming from increased growth only for deficit reductions. He
suggested instead that the money could go on promoting job-creation
by reducing labor charges.
	   Many EU nations made great efforts to get their deficit-to-GDP
ratios below the 3 percent necessary for entry into the euro
currency bloc and are already committed to still lower deficits.
	   Figures released Thursday showed the EU's largest economies,
Germany and France, picking up steam after prolonged slowdown.
Germany's first-quarter growth was 3.8 percent on last year, the
best performance since reunification in 1990. French first-quarter
growth was up 3.5 percent. Other euro-group nations such as
Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands are doing even better.
	   With results like that, de Silguy said deficits could be cut
without further belt-tightening.
	   There was a further blow for de Silguy when ministers approved a
much diluted version of guidelines the Commission drew up for EU
economic policies in 1999.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' de Silguy told reporters. ``The text is
not satisfactory.''
	   The guidelines will be formally adopted by EU leaders at their
summit in Cardiff, Wales, later this month. They urge EU nations to
follow sound finances, low inflation and modernization of labor
markets, but governments took out much of the Commission's toughest
language.

Georgian housewife fends off marauding Russian soldiers

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A 57-year-old Georgian woman overcame
marauding Russian soldiers with a kitchen knife and had them
arrested, officials said Friday.
	   The incident occurred late Thursday in the southern Georgian
town of Akhaltsikhe when two 21-year-old soldiers broke into
Natella Ivanidze's home and threatened her and her 60-year-old
husband with knives, demanding money and vodka, the Georgian
Interior Ministry said.
	   Ivanidze fought back with a kitchen knife, wounding one soldier,
Alexander Balov, and then holding both attackers until police
arrived.
	   Balov was hospitalized in stable condition. Authorities filed
charges against the soldiers.
	   Georgia signed an agreement with Russia to let some of its
troops stay after the Soviet collapse.

  RETRANSMITTING to fix slug line  

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ Former champion Pernell
``Sweetpea'' Whitaker, serving a drug-related suspension from
boxing, was charged with driving while under the influence of
alcohol.
	   Whitaker, who has won six world titles in four weight classes,
was stopped while driving Thursday morning, police spokesman Lou
Thurston said Friday. The fighter was released on dlrs 1,000 bail,
and a hearing was set for July 15 in traffic court.
	   Whitaker's blood-alcohol level _ a measure of the amount of
alcohol in the blodstream _ was 0.13, The Virginian-Pilot newspaper
reported, citing a source it did not identify. The maximum legal
limit is 0.08. Thurston said he could not discuss Whitaker's
blood-alcohol level.
	   Whitaker's attorney, Lionel Hancock III, told the newspaper
there was an ``incident'' involving the boxer Thursday morning but
that he and Whitaker had not discussed the facts.
	   Hancock did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment Friday.
	   Whitaker's arrest came at a time when the boxer's career was at
a crossroads. The six-time world champion from Virginia Beach,
Virginia, is serving a six-month suspension from boxing as the
result of a positive test for cocaine in February. The suspension
ends Sept. 11.
	   That was Whitaker's second positive test within a four-month
period. He also failed a drug test in conjunction with his Oct. 17
victory over Andrei Pestriaev at the Pequot's Foxwoods Resort
Casino in Connecticut.
	   As part of a settlement with the Mashantucket Pequot Gaming
Commission to lift that suspension, Whitaker was required to take
random drug tests and check into a rehabilitation center if he
tested positive again.
	   His first random drug test came back positive for cocaine in

	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Friday brought together for the
first time the main parties in the Diana investigation, in an
effort to finally clarify the role of photographers in the crash.
	   Grouped together were the photographers under investigation in
the case; eight witnesses to the crash; Mohamed Al Fayed; Diana's
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, and the parents of driver Henri Paul.
They were accompanied by a platoon of lawyers.
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel last Aug. 31 killed Diana,
her companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But was it merely a case of a drunk driver, or was there
responsibility on the part of the paparazzi trailing Diana's
Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and one press motorcyclist have been placed
under investigation _ a step short of being formally charged. They
have remained in legal limbo for almost a year, continuing their
work.
	   In what was seen as a last-ditch effort to clarify their roles,
Stephan was questioning each photographer one by one.
	   Lawyers and witnesses emerging from the courtroom described the
process. The judge asked each photographer to give an account of
their role that night. He then questioned them, questioned
witnesses as to what they had seen of the photographer's behavior,
and opened questions to other lawyers.
	   According to lawyers, photographer Romuald Rat was harshly
questioned by lawyers for Al Fayed, who tried to establish that he
pursued the Mercedes that night.
	   ``I followed it. I did not pursue it,'' Rat responded.
	   During an afternoon break, Al Fayed railed against the
paparazzi.
	   ``If I was not in a courtroom, I would hang them all,'' he said.
	   ``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did. They were
like vultures around the bodies.''
	   Al Fayed also had harsh words for Diana's mother.
	   ``She won't talk to me,'' he said. ``She thinks she's in the
royal family. ``I'm just an ordinary guy, a working-class guy. It's
snobbery.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd emerged from the courtroom during a break, but
waved away journalists.
	   She, Al Fayed, and Paul's family are civil parties in the case,
meaning they have access to documents and proceedings.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   ``It's so painstaking,'' Mailliez told The Associated Press of
the meeting. ``It's thorough, but it's taking a long time.''
	   Lawyers said the policemen who spoke accused Rat of hindering
their work.
	   Another witness, private chauffeur Clifford Gooroovadoo, said
he'd told the judge he saw Rat and another photographer, Christian
Martinez, fighting just after the accident. He said Rat, after
taking his own pictures, was telling Martinez to stop.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many close to the case believe they will soon be exonerated, at
least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,''
Arsov told The AP. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have
to do their job.''
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily guarded by police.
The nine-hour session, including a lunch break, ended early Friday
evening.
	   In the morning, Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a
Mercedes, surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Friday brought together for the
first time the main parties in the Diana investigation, in an
effort to finally clarify the role of photographers in the crash.
	   Grouped together were the photographers under investigation in
the case; eight witnesses to the crash; Mohamed Al Fayed; Diana's
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, and the parents of driver Henri Paul.
They were accompanied by a platoon of lawyers.
	   The crash in a Paris traffic tunnel last Aug. 31 killed Diana,
her companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Paul. Tests showed Paul was
drunk at the time.
	   But was it merely a case of a drunk driver, or was there
responsibility on the part of the paparazzi trailing Diana's
Mercedes that night?
	   Nine photographers and one press motorcyclist have been placed
under investigation _ a step short of being formally charged. They
have remained in legal limbo for almost a year, continuing their
work.
	   In what was seen as a last-ditch effort to clarify their roles,
Stephan was questioning each photographer one by one.
	   Lawyers and witnesses emerging from the courtroom described the
process. The judge asked each photographer to give an account of
their role that night. He then questioned them, questioned
witnesses as to what they had seen of the photographer's behavior,
and opened questions to other lawyers.
	   According to lawyers, photographer Romuald Rat was harshly
questioned by lawyers for Al Fayed, who tried to establish that he
pursued the Mercedes that night.
	   ``I followed it. I did not pursue it,'' Rat responded.
	   During an afternoon break, Al Fayed railed against the
paparazzi.
	   ``If I was not in a courtroom, I would hang them all,'' he said.
	   ``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did. They were
like vultures around the bodies.''
	   Al Fayed also had harsh words for Diana's mother.
	   ``She won't talk to me,'' he said. ``She thinks she's in the
royal family. ``I'm just an ordinary guy, a working-class guy. It's
snobbery.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd emerged from the courtroom during a break, but
waved away journalists.
	   She, Al Fayed, and Paul's family are civil parties in the case,
meaning they have access to documents and proceedings.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   ``It's so painstaking,'' Mailliez told The Associated Press of
the meeting. ``It's thorough, but it's taking a long time.''
	   Lawyers said the policemen who spoke accused Rat of hindering
their work.
	   Another witness, private chauffeur Clifford Gooroovadoo, said
he'd told the judge he saw Rat and another photographer, Christian
Martinez, fighting just after the accident. He said Rat, after
taking his own pictures, was telling Martinez to stop.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many close to the case believe they will soon be exonerated, at
least on the manslaughter charge.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,''
Arsov told The AP. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have
to do their job.''
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily guarded by police.
The nine-hour session, including a lunch break, ended early Friday
evening.
	   In the morning, Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a
Mercedes, surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to

The nine-hour session, including a lunch break, ended early Friday
evening.
	   In the morning, Al Fayed drew up to the main courthouse in a
Mercedes, surrounded by four other cars and about 10 bodyguards.
	   It isn't just his son's death that connects Al Fayed to the
case. Driver Paul was an employee of the Ritz Hotel, which Al Fayed
owns.
	   ``I hope that God will find the truth for us,'' he said as he
left the Ritz in the morning.
	   Although the probe is not complete, investigators long have
believed it was Paul's drunken condition and the Mercedes'
excessive speed that probably caused the crash.
	   They also are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   Tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes Diana
was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before October _
meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited
on an ``informational basis,'' but decided not to come.

Annan condemns Serb ``atrocities'' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In an unusually blunt statement,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan accused Serb military and paramilitary
forces of ``atrocities'' in Kosovo and demanded Friday that ``this
kind of aggression'' be confronted ``immediately and with
determination.''
	   The statement, read by U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt, was
unusual because it specifically accused Serb forces of atrocities
in a military action within areas which the international community
recognizes as part of the Serbian republic.
	   The United Nations is often reluctant to level such accusations
against sovereign governments for actions within their borders.
	   ``The secretary-general is deeply disturbed by the latest
reports of an intensifying campaign against the unarmed civilian
population in Kosovo,'' Brandt said. ``He reiterates in the
strongest possible terms his condemnation of the atrocities
committed by Serbian military and paramilitary forces.''
	   He said those forces ``must not be allowed to repeat the
campaign of ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate attacks on
civilians that characterized the war in Bosnia.''
	   ``If the world has learned anything from that dire chapter in
history, it is that this kind of aggression must be confronted
immediately and with determination,'' the statement added.
	   In the statement, Annan said he was ``encouraged by NATO's
resolve'' to prevent a further escalation of the fighting and
repeated his call for a negotiated settlement between Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians and the government in Belgrade.
	   Brandt said U.N. refugee officials in northern Albania report
that the influx of refugees from Kosovo appears to be slowing. He
said 400 people crossed the border into Albania by dawn Friday.
	   Brandt also said the United Nations was investigating reports
that Serb forces in Kosovo are using an armored personnel carrier
stolen from Dutch U.N. troops during the Bosnian war.
	   He did not say whether the United Nations had first-hand
evidence to substantiate the reports.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
	   Ethnic Albanians and officials chosen by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad autonomy in
1989, opened talks under Western pressure last month. Agreement
appears unlikely.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  Ed: AMs; UPDATES with report of mass grave, new shortages; recasts
and trims.
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The latest Serbian offensive in
independence-minded Kosovo province produced reports on Friday of
50 dead, 200 missing, villages destroyed and a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   Hundreds more joined the thousands who have already fled the
fighting in the week since the offensive began, with most of them
heading for neighboring Albania.
	   Some of them didn't make it. In Geneva, the United Nations
refugee agency said some of the 400 or so who trekked into
neighboring Albania overnight had reported five deaths en route _
two elderly people, said to have died of exhaustion, and three
small children. About 10,000 refugees are now gathered around
Tropoja in northern Albania, produced by the largest exodus since
ethnic tensions erupted into large-scale violence in March.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources were often conflicting
and proved impossible to verify. Still, together, they reflected
the intensity of the conflict as Serbian government forces tried by
force to destroy the Kosovo Albanian drive to secede.
	   Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanians' main party, listed more than 50 dead and some 200
missing from the latest offensive, concentrated around Decani, some
70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Four villages populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed,
another eight badly damaged, and 16 others deserted by fleeing
residents, Cacaj added.
	   The Beta news in Belgrade quoted unnamed refugees from Decani,
as saying a mass grave on the outskirts of the Serb-besieged town
contained 300 bodies. There were no details.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leaders in
the province, said one Albanian was killed and two wounded in
fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
of Pristina. It said Serb shelling continued in the Decani area and
around the town of Djakovica in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an Albanian woman wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts are impossible to verify independently, as both Serbian
police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ fighting
for independence _ block adequate access to journalists and even
humanitarian workers. Pristina-based human rights groups on Friday
warned that food and medicines in some blocked off areas was
extremely short and asked for international aid,
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro, which with
Serbia, forms Yugoslavia.
	   There were conflicting reports of Serb casualties, with Cacaj
saying three policemen trying to loot a house had been shot dead by
its Albanian owner, and the Serb Media Center denying any officers
were killed or wounded.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.
	   The clandestine KLA, which first surfaced in 1996, says the
peaceful principles of the top Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are futile.
	   A delegation picked by Rugova and officials chosen by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad
autonomy in 1989, opened a dialogue under Western pressure last
month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts. The Serbs showed up anyway for the talks,
to which Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is serving as unofficial mediator.
	   Hill noted that it is ``extremely difficult'' to get a true
picture of events around Decani.

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

Caribbean regional court to get chief justice in six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ A new chief justice of
the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court will be chosen by a special
committee within the next six months, several national leaders
said.
	   The post has been filled by acting Justice Denis Byron of St.
Kitts and Nevis for nearly two years.
	   The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States heads of government
appointed a committee to fill the vacancy at their meeting here May
27-29.
	   Antigua Prime Minister Lester Bird said afterwards that the
committee would make a recommendation before the next meeting of
the heads of state at the end of November.
	   Bird said the long impasse on naming a new chief justice was due
to the lack of a clear procedure for choosing a candidate.
	   But British Virgin Islands Bar Association President Michael
Riegels said he was ``surprised and appalled that the only step
taken was to set up a committee which is not to report for another
six months.''

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

Three killed in rocket attack on Kabul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Nine rockets slammed into
Afghanistan's capital Friday, killing three children and wounding
six other civilians, officials of the Taliban religious government
said.
	   In retaliation, the Taliban sent warplanes on bombing missions
over towns and military positions in territory held by the
opposition alliance, said the officials on condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting also raged in the far north of Afghanistan, where
Taliban forces were trying to seize part of the 15 percent of
Afghanistan that remains in the hands of the opposition, the
officials said.
	   Some 100 soldiers were captured in the Baghdis province, along
with heavy and light weapons. Reports of the fighting could not be
independently confirmed, and alliance commanders could not be
reached for comment.
	   The attack on Kabul was one of the heaviest in recent months.
The nearest front line is barely 12 miles away from the city _ well
within rocket range of opposition soldiers.
	   Until recently, the opposition attempted to hit only the airport
to stop the Taliban jets' daily bombing raids.
	   Kabul, a city of about 750,000, had been fairly peaceful since
the Taliban ousted former military chief Ahmed Shah Massood in
September 1996.
	   Between 1992 and 1996, when the capital was ruled by Massood and
then-Afghanistan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, it was under almost
constant siege by rival Muslim groups.
	   In the 85 percent of territory under its control, the Taliban
has imposed rigid Islamic laws that ban women from working, forbid
girls from attending school, and force men to grow beards and pray
five times daily at the mosque.

failed to completely cross the goal line.

cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.

by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the

World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball

	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

Volkswagen wins control of Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
  With BC-Britain-Rolls-Royce Glance  
  Eds: AMs version; new material throughout  
  By DIRK BEVERIDGE  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The realities of global commerce caught up with a
grand remnant of British glory Friday as Volkswagen AG won approval
to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, infuriating small English investors.
	   ``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' incredulous shareholder
Rodney Crowe asked at a meeting called by Vickers PLC, the
engineering group that is selling Rolls-Royce to the Germans.
	   Shareholders approved Volkswagen's 430 million pound (dlrs 700
million) deal over a 340 million pound (dlrs 554 million) offer
from rival BMW, in a raucus session punctuated by outbursts of
nationalism.
	   ``What are we going to have? A flying lady on the front of the
Beetle?'' Crowe said later, conjuring up an image of the
distinctive Rolls-Royce hood ornament perched on a Volkswagen Bug.
	   Vickers, an engineering group almost thrown out of business by
Rolls-Royce's losses in the last recession, said the sale was the
best way forward for all concerned.
	   Rolls-Royce is financially healthy now, but the Vickers
chairman, Sir Colin Chandler, said it needs a strong owner with
automotive expertise to steer through an increasingly globalized
and highly competitive industry.
	   Volkswagen, the biggest carmaker in Europe, is an ideal match,
Chandler said.
	   Rolls-Royce managers had considered a buyout, one of many
proposals to keep Rolls-Royce British, but they could not afford
enough capital investment to secure the company's future.
	   ``We would love to remain British, but we have to stay
realistic,'' Rolls-Royce chairman Graham Morris said.
	   Volkswagen is driving to the top of the luxury car market by
purchasing one of the great motoring traditions of the century.
Rolls-Royce makes its Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars entirely by
hand, selling them for prices that begin at around dlrs 250,000
each.
	   The very idea of Rolls-Royce going German had some investors
sounding like they wanted to replay World War II.
	   ``For God's sake, try and take a broad view for the country,''
said Desmond Lake, drawing cheers by referring to Volkswagen's
origins in Nazi Germany.
	   After getting an earful, Volkswagen now faces more hurdles.
	   The jilted suitor, BMW, said Friday it will terminate a contract
for supplying some engines to Rolls-Royce. BMW wouldn't say how
long its engines will stay in the pipeline.
	   Volkswagen is addressing the matter by agreeing to buy the
British auto engine maker Cosworth, also from Vickers, for 120
million pounds (dlrs 196 million).
	   Volkswagen might run into further difficulties with Rolls-Royce
PLC, a separate company making jet engines. Rolls-Royce PLC
controls the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo and favored a deal
with BMW, its partner in an aerospace venture.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC wouldn't say Friday whether it will try to block
Volkswagen's use of the brand name.
	   Chandler, the Vickers chairman, said a 25-year-old contract
allowing Rolls-Royce PLC to veto the purchase of Rolls-Royce Motors
Cars Ltd. by a foreign buyer is unenforceable under current
European law.
	   ``The trademark can't go anywhere else,'' Chandler said. ``We
exclusively own the radiator, the flying lady and Bentley.''
	   The takeover was delayed by a Rolls-Royce enthusiasts group,
called Crewe Motors after the English town where Rolls-Royce is
based.
	   Lawyer Michael Shrimpton runs the group that wants to keep
Rolls-Royce British, and he claimed he was assembling a 500 million
pound (dlrs 815 million) offer from mysterious private backers.
	   Shrimpton had already tried but failed to bid for Rolls-Royce.
After the Vickers board adjourned the meeting to talk privately
with Shrimpton, Chandler said the latest proposal had no substance.
	   A great-nephew of Rolls-Royce co-founder Sir Henry Royce tried
to stop the deal by nitpicking at the paperwork.
	   ``There are so many mistakes in this document that I'm sure it's
illegal,'' Peter Royce said, his voice bellowing with anger.
	   ``I think it's a sad day,'' lamented investor Rodney Timson.
``Rolls-Royce represents British engineering excellence and it
won't be ours after this. We're losing the family silver, and the
nation's not bothered.''

EU nominates German as development bank boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers Friday
unanimously endorsed the nomination of Germany's Horst Koehler as
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
	   Koehler's appointment is now largely a formality, since the 15
EU nations have a majority of votes on the board of the
London-based bank which channels Western aid to nations of the
former Soviet bloc.
	   The European bloc has been unable to agree on a head for the
bank since January, when Frenchman Jacques Delarosiere stepped
down. Since then, the bank has been run by Charles Frank, its
American vice president.
	   Agreement on Koehler came after Spain withdrew its candidate,
former finance minister Pedro Solbes.
	   Koehler is a former a state secretary at the German Finance
Ministry and was Chancellor Helmut Kohl's envoy at meetings of the
Group of Seven industrialized countries. He has been president of
the Association of German Savings Banks since 1993.
	   The EBRD was set up in 1991 to promote the transition towards
market-oriented economies in 26 countries in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. It has a capital base of dlrs 20 billion.

Moya, Corretja reach men's final
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Corretja defeating Pioline  
  By ROB GLOSTER  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alex Corretja wore down Cedric Pioline on a muggy
center court Friday to join Carlos Moya in an all-Spanish men's
final at the French Open.
	   Corretja took advantage of Pioline's exhaustion to win their
semifinal 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, ending Pioline's hopes of becoming the
first Frenchman to win at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.
	   In 28-degree C (82-degree F) heat and smothering humidity,
Corretja took the first set in 53 minutes. It took him 50 minutes
to capture the second set, and he finished off the drained Pioline
_ who had played three five-setters to reach the semifinals _ in
just 38 minutes in the final set.
	   In the third set, with both players putting icepacks on their
necks during changeovers, Pioline made consecutive double faults to
help give Corretja a service break in the second game.
	   Pioline was broken again for 4-1, slamming his racket into his
chair, and again in the final game.
	   ``Cedric, today, I saw he was very tired. It was very difficult
for him, but for me it was very good,'' Corretja said as he came
off the court.
	   Moya, overcoming a patient fellow Spaniard, defeated Felix
Mantilla 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in the other semifinal.
	   Moya mixed his powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots
to throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third set. But Moya won the next five games, losing
just five points during that span, to take control of the match.
	   ``I just decided to take more risks than I was taking before,''
Moya said. ``I decided there had to be a change, otherwise that set
was for him. Two set to one down, it's tough to come back.''
	   Moya got to match point with a 127-mph serve that handcuffed
Mantilla, then hit a 122-mph service winner to finish off the
2-hour, 42-minute match.
	   On Thursday, Monica Seles advanced to the French Open final for
the first time since 1992 and won for the first time against
Martina Hingis, yet showed none of the giddy enthusiasm she had as
a teen-ager.
	   Though Seles flashed a big smile after her 6-3, 6-2 victory in
the semifinals of the event she won three straight times in the
early 1990s, her success was tempered by playing in her first
tournament since her father died of cancer on May 14.
	   ``I do feel happy. I mean, it's really great. But I've tried to
keep a sense of balance,'' said Seles, who pumped her fist in
triumph after Thursday's win over the world's top-ranked woman.
``I'm still going to be missing people. Some things in my life are
not going to be better.''
	   She'll face Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Saturday's final. Sanchez
Vicario celebrated her 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport by blowing a kiss to her Yorkshire terrier in the
VIP box.
	   Seles is 14-2 against Sanchez Vicario, a two-time French Open
champion.
	   Seles is wearing her father's ring on a chain around her neck
and has worn black throughout the French Open. Although the outfit
was chosen before her father's death, she said the color is
fitting.
	   ``I'm really glad it's not a bright color, because it just feels
more appropriate,'' Seles said. ``I try to give respect to Dad.''
	   Seles, who slammed two-handed winners within inches of the
lines, lost all five previous matches against Hingis _ including a
loss in the semifinals here last year.
	   Hingis was overpowering in her run to the semifinals, not losing
a set in the tournament and having little trouble with
eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
	   But the sixth-seeded Seles was in control throughout, moving
Hingis all over the court with shots that skimmed just over the
net.
	   ``She just hits everything very hard and very aggressively from
every place on the court,'' Hingis said. ``Usually she makes more
mistakes or she gets a little bit tired, but today she just
didn't.''
	   Seles was the aggressor from the start, showing her intensity by
walking back on court first after every changeover. Hingis,
normally composed, scolded herself and bounced her racket on the
clay in frustration.
	   ``I knew I had to come out and be really aggressive,'' Seles
said. ``I knew I had that in me. I wasn't sure if I could do that
today, but I really believed I could.''
	   Hingis won every Grand Slam tournament title last year except
the French Open, losing in the final to Iva Majoli. She said Seles,
who at 24 is seven years older than Hingis, ran her to exhaustion.
	   ``I was probably getting a little bit tired. She just made me
run, and she didn't make any mistakes,'' Hingis said. ``I guess she
surprised everybody.
	   ``I mean, she was around for quite a while, then all of a sudden
she was gone for years,'' Hingis added. ``And here she is back, in
better shape and probably better than ever.''
	   Seles was 17 when she won her first Grand Slam tournament title
at the 1990 French Open, the first of three straight championships
at Roland Garros. She ruled women's tennis in those years, her
victories punctuated with high-pitched grunts. Off the court, she
was a teen-ager with an infectious giggle.
	   But all that changed in April 1993, when a spectator came out of
the stands at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, and stabbed her in
the back. Seles didn't return to the tennis tour until August 1995,
and even then she was subdued and emotionally strained.
	   The last two years have been even tougher because of the failing
health of her father, Karolj, who until shortly before his death
was her only coach. She was at his side in Sarasota, Fla., when he
died.
	   ``Obviously, the last five years have been very difficult in
terms of walking on the court, while before I only had to worry
about winning or losing the tennis match,'' she said. ``It's not
the same as it was before the stabbing. It never will be, and I
don't want it to be.''

Belarus' Lukashenko blames businesses from growing inflation
</HEADLINE>
  By MARINA BABKINA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko lashed out
at the government and businesses Friday for failing to obey his
orders to control inflation by keeping prices down.
	   Lukashenko declared last year that monthly inflation in Belarus
was not to exceed 2 percent, and ordered businesses to make it
happen.
	   Lukashenko blamed the failure of his plan Friday on business
leaders, accusing them of increasing prices to finance lavish
lifestyles.
	   ``We have all sorts of crooks getting fat, living well, because
this is all paid for at the expense of the people, through price
increases,'' Lukashenko told government officials.
	   ``It's very simple: You want to buy a Mercedes, you buy it _
whether you have money or not _ and then raise prices,'' he said.
``To earn money and live well, one must work well and not conceal
one's wrongdoings and mismanagement behind price increases.''
	   Belarus has made fewer market reforms than probably any other
former Soviet republic, with most factories and businesses
remaining under state control.
	   The national currency, the Belarusian ruble, has suffered
another dramatic slump recently, leading to a surge in prices for
what meager goods are available in the stores.
	   Lukashenko also criticized the export of food from the republic,
saying he was willing to allow only government-controlled exporting
_ mostly to Russia.
	   ``Every day we are getting reports _ anybody who wants to, is
exporting, any way he wants to,'' he said. ``How have we protected
our market from pilfering, from exports of goods? We haven't at
all!''

Angola's former rebels angered by U.N., say peace in peril
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's former rebel movement Friday
expressed dismay at a United Nations report accusing it of keeping
a hidden army and warned that the claim could plunge the country
back into civil war.
	   UNITA's secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato said Friday's
scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Angola ``means nothing''
and is part of ``an international conspiracy'' against the rebel
movement.
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
was due to report to the council on the overdue implementation of
the 1994 peace agreement between the government and UNITA.
	   Beye said earlier this week that UNITA was hiding armed men in
remote areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the
movement's pledge that it had demobilized its 70,000-strong
guerilla army.
	   Speaking by telephone from UNITA's central highland stronghold
at Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Luanda, Paulo
Lukamba Gato said Beye's report on the situation in Angola was ``a
bad mistake'' and ``very dangerous'' for the peace process.
	   He said reports that UNITA had armed men hidden in the bush was
based on unreliable third-hand reports and ``could cost the peace
process dearly'' by prompting the government to launch a military
offensive against its former foe.
	   Gato said the government ``could take Bailundo in 30 minutes,
but we'd flee and then what would happen?''
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the southwest African nation's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to the bush.
	   Since then, the U.N. has slapped sanctions on UNITA in an
attempt to push it into compliance with the redrawn peace accord.
	   Gato complained that the Security Council was ignoring the
former rebel movement's legitimate concerns about handing over its
four remaining strongholds to the government.
	   ``We're not part of this (United Nations) club. We're guilty
till proven innocent,'' he said.

Saving tax proposal divides EU ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers were divided
Friday over plans to introduce an EU-wide tax on savings to prevent
cross-border tax dodging.
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigal said such a tax was
essential to stop citizens hording their savings in low-tax
accounts in other EU nations. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown pledged to oppose the tax as a threat to national
interest.
	   The EU's executive Commission proposed an EU-wide tax of 20
percent on interest gained on savings accounts.
	   The proposal was largely in reply to concerns from Germany,
Austria, Belgium and others that citizens are evading taxes by
keeping savings in other EU nations where there are low or no taxes
on interest.
	   Those countries, principally Luxembourg and Britain, are
determined to resist such proposal, fearing it will damage their
financial sectors.
	   ``We are not prepared to lose business as a result of these
proposals,'' Brown told a news conference. ``We will not allow that
to happen.''
	   Opponents of the taxes would seem to have the upper hand since,
under EU rules, taxation is usually left up to national governments
and EU-wide measures must be agreed unanimously by all 15 member
nations.
	   However, Waigel said Austria which takes over the rotating
presidency of the EU from Britain on July 1 and Germany which
follows Austria on Jan. 1 were determined to see the measure
adopted.
	   If not, the Germans and their supporters fear more money will
flow out of the reach of their tax collectors after the
introduction of a single currency, the euro, in 11 of the EU
nations on Jan. 1.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ In an attempt at damage control, a
freshly resigned employee of Slovakia's main group of opposition
parties on Friday said he was assuming responsibility for a bribery
affair tainting the coalition.
	   Jozef Paczelt spoke to reporters a day after stepping down as
election manager for the Slovak Democratic Coalition, which is
reeling under accusations of involvement in trying to bribe
journalists in exchange for favorable reporting.
	   Nobody in the party has been directly implicated, and even if
the attempted bribery occurred it is unclear whether it was on the
initiative of an advertising agency handling the coalition's
election campaign.
	   Still, the scandal has hurt the opposition grouping, whose main
asset going into September elections has been the aura of
corruption surrounding the government of authoritarian Premier
Vladimir Meciar.

	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup countdown underway in a country
crippled by labor disputes, defiant sports officials predicted
Friday that soccer would prevail.
	   After marathon overnight talks ended in stalemate, Air France
officials were scheduled to meet pilots for a fourth round of
negotiations to try and end the five-day strike.
	   The meeting, originally scheduled for 6 p.m. (1600 GMT.) was put
back three hours, Air France announced.
	   At stake was the reputation of both company and the nation, as
well as travel plans for an estimated one million people expected
to come to France to watch the soccer bonanza.
	   ``Soccer is more important than any social movements,'' Sepp
Blatter, a candidate for the most powerful job in soccer _ head of
the world governing body FIFA _ said Friday.
	   ``I can assure you that all 64 matches will be played and that
the French will do everything possible to welcome the foreigners
coming to France,'' Blatter added.
	   With the World Cup June 10 opener between Brazil and Scotland
fast approaching, fans arriving in France have been hit by the
pilots strikes, as well as walkouts by ground mechanics, train
drivers and baggage handlers.
	   Michel Platini, former French soccer great and co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee, said five years of planning
would not be wrecked by labor disputes.
	   ``De Gaulle once said it was difficult to govern a country with
360 types of cheese. But we shall persevere,'' he said, referring
to former French leader Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
	   Across France, travelers were stranded Friday, as several
long-distance train services were canceled, offering no alternative
to frustrated air travelers.
	   Hani Samaha, a 33-year-old Lebanese man looking to re-route his
flight after one to the United Arab Emirates was canceled, said:
``I left France a long time ago. And every time I come back, it's
stressful.''
	   ``Look at Air France's publicity,'' he said pointing at the
French company's billboard which said ``Official World Cup Air
Line'' at a ticketing office on the Champs Elysees.
	   ``It doesn't do the French image much good, does it?''
	   Stephane Jourdain, 19, said soccer fans would not remember ``a
beautiful country, but one immobilized by public service workers
not doing their work.''
	   ``It's organized chaos,'' she said while standing in line at the
same office.
	   Despite the positive signs from sports officials, negotiators
were less optimistic.
	   ``(We will) start nearly at zero,'' said Christian Paris,
spokesman for the main pilots' union, the SNPL, referring to
Friday's talks.
	   Air France's highly paid pilots are protesting planned salary
cuts. The company wants to give them stock in exchange for (500
million francs) dlrs 83 million in pay cuts.
	   The pilots are scheduled to strike for at least 15 days, and
have said the stoppage could even be extended, paralyzing the World
Cup which runs until July 12.
	   Air France, whose planes carry images of the stars of the World
Cup, say all teams will be transported during the tournament.
	   Still, many teams already have been inconvenienced.
	   Many French players could not get back to their training base on
time Monday after a three-day holiday weekend. The U.S. team, which
arrived Friday, took a special charter to avoid the strike.

Company defends itself after boss accused of money laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A firm whose managing director faces Swiss
money-laundering charges in a case linked to former Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto denied Friday that any of its employees had
violated any national or international laws.
	   Geneva-based Cotecna Inspection said it was having to ``bear the
brunt of internal political rivalries in Pakistan.''
	   A company statement accused the Pakistan government of doing
nothing about customs fraud totaling more than dlrs 650 million
which Cotecna said it had uncovered during a two-year contract in
the mid-1990s.
	   ``Cotecna Inspection SA confirms its determination to vigorously
defend its interests,'' said the statement.
	   Cotecna and its former parent company, Societe Generale de
Surveillance, lost their contracts to inspect imports and exports
from Pakistan after Bhutto was ousted from government in November
1996 on charges of corruption and misrule.
	   Cotecna's managing director Robert Massey was one of three Swiss
citizens indicted earlier this week on money laundering charges
linked to the former premier and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari.
	   The Swiss charges were initially announced by Pakistan's
anti-corruption investigator Senator Saif-ur Rehman, who was
present Tuesday when Judge Daniel Devaud announced the indictments.
	   Devaud later confirmed the indictments.
	   Cotecna said in a statement Friday no-one it had dealt with
directly or indirectly had taken actions which didn't
``scrupulously respect national and international laws, as well as
recognized business practices.''
	   The charges involve legitimate commissions, the company said.
	   Cotecna said its five-year contract to inspect imports and
exports from Pakistan was ``unilaterally and illegally terminated''
at the end of two years after a new Pakistani government took
power.
	   Rehman showed reporters documents he gave Devaud, saying they
indicated kickbacks flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands from Pakistani
government contracts with Cotecna and SGS.
	   Devaud confirmed he would indict Zardari and intended to indict
Ms. Bhutto if he determines she cannot receive diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity. Rehman said the Swiss conducted the
investigation at the request of the Pakistani government.
	   Rehman said he does not know the full scope of Devaud's case,
but he believes more than dlrs 250 million are in Bhutto family
accounts in Swiss banks, which the Swiss government has blocked at
Pakistan's request.
	   Swiss authorities said last October they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts frozen in
seven Geneva banks.
	   Rehman said he expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks
in Britain and the United States. Pakistan also is working with
authorities in France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto
case, he said.

Russian leaders meet on Start II; no early vote seen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top Russian officials met Friday to discuss
ratification of the Start II treaty with the United States, which
the parliament speaker said wouldn't be considered until this fall,
a news agency said.
	   Earlier in the year, government and legislative leaders had
predicted passage of the nuclear reduction treaty this summer.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the State Duma, met
with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, Atomic Minister Yevgeny Adamov and others, Interfax said.
	   Speaker to reporters afterward, Seleznyov refused to discuss the
substance of the discussion, but said he thought the treaty would
not come up for a vote this summer.
	   Hearings are scheduled on the issue on June 16, and Seleznyov
said he expected Start II to be debated in the Duma, the lower
house of parliament, in September.
	   START II was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, and President
Boris Yeltsin has been anxious for the Duma to do the same.
President Bill Clinton has said he doesn't want to hold a summit
with Yeltsin in Moscow until after the treaty is passed.
	   The treaty would roughly halve Russian and American nuclear
arsenals to 3,500 warheads each.

Trade union provides temporary support for bank strike
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with bank management call for
court order to ban strike  

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The management of Ionian Bank filed a law
suit on Friday calling for a near month-long strike by its
employees to be deemed illegal.
	   Ionian workers are protesting plans to privatize Greece's fourth
largest bank. The strike has threatened to derail government
efforts to streamline the economy and meet criteria to join the
European Union's single currency club.
	   This is the third law suit filed against unions by Ionian
management since employees walked off the job on May 8. In both
previous cases, the court deemed the strike illegal on the grounds
that workers failed to appoint a skeleton staff to serve clients.
	   But in order to circumvent the court ban, employees applied for
support first from an umbrella bank employees' union and then from
GSEE, one of the country's largest trade unions.
	   On Thursday, GSEE vouched to support the strikers until June 10,
although employees vowed to continue their walkout until June 19,
when shareholders will vote on the bank's sale.
	   If the court rules against the strike again, workers will have
to decide between returning to work or risk losing their jobs by
continuing with an illegal strike.
	   ``I'm outraged,'' said Ioannis Markakis, president of Ionian's
union. ``The government is abolishing strikes in Greece. Will it
also abolish democracy?''
	   GSEE president Christos Polyzogopoulos also criticized the
government for backing the law suit, saying the state's behavior is
``unacceptable because instead of actions which would contribute to
the deffusion of tension ... it is proceeding with repressive
interventions.''
	   Earlier, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas noted that the
government had met one of the workers' main demands. ``The decision
to extend the strike is completely unjustified,'' he said.
	   Strikers were not swayed by a government offer Tuesday to
provide current Ionian employees with a guaranteed job until the
retirement age of 62.

U.S. Virgin Islands orders ferry and barge companies to negotiate
</HEADLINE>
dispute  
  By JUDI SHIMEL  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Government
regulators reversed a ruling that would have stopped commercial
barges from carrying passengers between St. Thomas and St. John and
told the ferry and barge companies to try to settle their dispute
by July 6.
	   The dispute centers on the barges allowing passengers to ride in
the cars they carry between the islands. The ferry companies said
in a 1996 complaint that the practice had caused them to lose half
a million dollars.
	   Public Service Commission Chairman Walter Challenger said this
week that he was going to give the companies one more chance to
reach a negotiated settlement. If that fails, he warned, the
commission will have to act.
	   Both businesses and individuals have said they prefer to
accompany their vehicles on the barge rather than catch a separate
ferry that leaves half an hour later.
	   ``We would not be very comfortable with a 20-foot refrigerated
truck travelling on the barge unattended,'' said Marty Pickholtz of
the Prime Food Co. of St. Thomas, which supplies St. John
restaurants and stores.
	   But Challenger said the law is on the side of the ferry
companies, which have the exclusive rights to transport passengers.
	   He said the commission reversed its ruling that would have
stopped the barges from carrying passengers because of the public
concerns.

Annan condemns Serb ``atrocities'' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Security Council discussions, British
statement  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In an unusually blunt statement, U.N.
chief Kofi Annan accused Serb forces of ``atrocities'' in Kosovo
and demanded Friday that ``this kind of aggression'' be confronted
``immediately and with determination.''
	   The Security Council discussed the deteriorating situation in
Kosovo on Friday, and British Ambassador John Weston said there was
``very considerable concern'' about the violence.
	   ``We all, I think, share the view that unfortunately, Belgrade
seems to be trying to impose a military solution upon the Kosovo
issue,'' Weston said. He said the council would consider
``additional measures'' beyond the arms embargo imposed last March
on Yugoslavia to urge a political solution.
	   Annan's statement, read by U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt,
was unusual because it specifically accused Serb forces of
atrocities in a military action within areas which the
international community recognizes as part of the Serbian republic.

EU-wide savings tax proposal divides ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union finance ministers were divided
Friday over plans to introduce an EU-wide tax on savings to prevent
cross-border tax dodging.
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigal said the tax was essential
to stop citizens hording their savings in low-tax accounts in other
EU nations. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown
pledged to oppose the tax as a threat to national interests.
	   The EU's executive Commission proposed an EU-wide tax of 20
percent on interest gained on savings accounts.
	   The proposal was largely in reply to concerns from Germany,
Austria, Belgium and others that citizens are evading taxes by
keeping savings in other EU nations where there are low or no taxes
on interest.
	   Those countries, principally Luxembourg and Britain, are
determined to resist such a proposal, fearing it will damage their
financial sectors.
	   ``We are not prepared to lose business as a result of these
proposals,'' Brown said. ``We will not allow that to happen.''
	   Opponents of the taxes would seem to have the upper hand since,
under EU rules, taxation is usually left up to national governments
and EU-wide measures must be agreed unanimously by all 15 member
nations.
	   However, Waigel said Austria, which takes over the rotating
presidency of the EU from Britain on July 1 and Germany, which
follows Austria on Jan. 1, were determined to see the measure
adopted.
	   If not, the Germans and their supporters fear more money will
flow out of the reach of their tax collectors after the
introduction of a single currency, the euro, in 11 of the EU
nations on Jan. 1.

Court throws out demand for ticket redistribution
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with new quotes  
  By RAF CASERT  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The legal fight over World Cup tickets was settled
Friday _ at least until the end of the tournament _ when the
Tribunal de Grande Instance threw out a challenge from 32 European
parliamentarians who claimed the sale unfairly favored the French.
	   The Paris court dismissed the case on technical grounds, but the
plaintiffs said the ruling sided with them on their main complaint
and said new challenges against the World Cup organizers could be
initiated in other European Union nations.
	   ``We are one-nil down at halftime, but the courts have given us
a penalty,'' said Graham Watson of Britain's Liberal Democrats of
Britain, referring to the possibility for citizens to sue
individually.
	   ``They have opened the way for any fan who was denied access to
tickets to take the French organizers to court for damages'' in
their national courts, Watson said.
	   But for the next six weeks, soccer will take over from the
courts.
	   ``We wish them well over the next month,'' said Luc Misson, the
lawyer for the European parliamentarians.
	   The deputies wanted to force the organizing committee, known by
the French acronym CFO, to redistribute 712,000 of the 2.6 million
tickets to allow citizens of the 15-nation EU a better chance at
buying seats.
	   They realized it was extremely unlikely to win a dramatic ruling
five days before the start of the championship.
	   ``We were not optimistic going in,'' Misson said.
	   The court threw out the case because it was considered a
class-action suit, a type the tribunal is not permitted to handle.
	   ``It was thrown out on a technical grounds. The court has not
dealt with the matter as such,'' said Phillip Jenkinson, another
attorney for the lawmakers.
	   But in its lengthy ruling, the court did criticize the CFO's
handling of the ticket distribution.
	   It noted that the largest part of the tickets was reserved for
French citizens and groups and businesses, and that often a French
address was needed.
	   ``The distribution system is likely to affect the rights of the
ensemble of citizens of the (European) Union,'' the court said.
	   The wording gave the Misson and Jenkinson hope the CFO could
still face fines.
	   Beside the legal challenges, the EU's executive Commission is
also investigating the ticket distribution and has threatened fines
of up to dlrs 14 million.
	   CFO President Michel Platini said that with 25 million requests
for 2.6 million places, it would have been impossible under any
circumstance to fulfill demand. Platini also argued that since the
French are paying for the stadiums, they had a right to a majority
of tickets.

  BC-German-Train Derails
  By TONY CZUCZKA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Edward Koenig knows his mother was
supposed to travel by train to Hamburg on Wednesday and that she
never arrived.
	   Two days after a high-speed train derailed and slammed into a
concrete overpass, killing at least 96 people, he still could only
fear the worst.
	   The severity of the disaster has made identifying victims a
painstaking process involving forensic dentists, doctors,
fingerprint experts and photographers.
	   Some bodies and remains are so badly mangled that DNA tests will
have to be ordered, a spokesman at the Hanover medical school
hospital, Christian Jung, said Friday.
	   The slow pace of identifying victims of the disaster, the worst
to strike Germany's prized rail system since World War II, has
amplified the distress of relatives anxious to know the fate of
loved ones.
	   In many instances, family members only suspect their relatives
boarded InterCity Express 884 somewhere between Munich and Hanover.
Unlike in an airline disaster, there are no passenger lists. People
may buy a ticket on board, so the number of passengers who need to
be accounted for cannot be determined.
	   Koenig traveled 350 kilometers (210 miles) from his home in the
Bavarian city of Nuremberg to Eschede early Thursday. With hopes
that his 67-year-old mother survived rapidly diminishing, Koenig
has been pressing authorities to allow him to view bodies to speed
identification.
	   But officials have refused, citing the mangled condition of many
of the victims. They also have refused to release personal
belongings that would place individuals on the train.
	   Koenig said relatives of victims should have the choice of
whether to view the gruesome remains, adding: ``It's up to me how I
want to deal with my grief.''
	   The bearded, trim school teachers said he and the handful of
other relatives staying in the town have received enormous support
from residents, grief counselors and spiritual advisers.
	   But only information, he said, will ease his frustration.
	   Authorities, however, said the process of identifying the bodies
is painstaking. By Friday, 19 victims had been identified.
	   The 96 bodies, or remains, found at the site have been taken to
a special morgue at the medical school hospital built in 1965 to
handle disasters. The train crash is the first disaster that has
filled capacity.
	   Four teams of six experts are working around the clock to record
distinguishing marks and personal belongings that might speed
identification.
	   People who suspect relatives died in the crash are asked to give
police dental records. Four forensic dental experts are working
with those.
	   So far, visual identification by relatives has been ruled out.
	   ``We don't want any relative to have to go from body to body
because it is just unbearable,'' Jung said. ``It's arms and legs
and heads. It's awful.''

Uzbek high court sentences members of fundamentalist sect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The supreme court of Uzbekistan has sentenced
seven members of a radical Islamic sect to prison terms of up to 10
years for stirring unrest in the country, a news agency reported
Friday.
	   The seven members of the Wahhabi sect were convicted of
attempting to undermine the country's constitutional system and
ignite ethnic and religious hatred, Interfax said.
	   Several were also convicted of illegally crossing the border and
illegal possession arms and drugs, according to the report.
	   Uzbekistan, a mostly Muslim former Soviet republic in Central
Asia, has blamed the Wahhabis for repeated acts of violence.
President Islam Karimov has said he believes the sect is intent on
replacing him with an Islamic government.

Russia, Azerbaijan to resume talks on Caspian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Azerbaijan have agreed to resume talks
on the use of the Caspian Sea, the Interfax news agency said
Friday.
	   Deputy Energy Minister Valery Garipov said a draft treaty was
almost ready to sign.
	   The countries bordering the Caspian _ Russia, Kazakstan,
Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan _ are deeply divided over control
of the sea and how to divide its vast natural resources.
	   The Caspian is one of the most promising sources of oil and gas
in the world.

  World Cup: Referee who okayed England's go-ahead goal, dead at 78

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer referee Gottfried Dienst, who
ruled in favor of England's controversial ``third goal'' in the
1966 World Cup victory over Germany, has died. He was 78.
	   Dienst died Monday in the Basel, Switzerland, Cantonal Hospital,
after a ``short and severe illness,'' said a family announcement in
the Baseler Zeitung. He was buried Friday.
	   The term ``Wembley goal'' is still used in soccer to describe a
ball that hits the underside of the crossbar and ricochets down to
the goal line.
	   When Geoff Hurst's ball bounced back into play in the 11th
minute of overtime, English players celebrated but the Germans ran
to Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest.
	   Dienst backed the linesman and awarded the goal which put
England ahead 3-2. Hurst went on to score again, gaining the only
World Cup final hattrick and giving England a 4-2 win.
	   Bakhramov died in Azerbaijan in 1993.
	   Television replays and photographs strongly suggested the ball
failed to completely cross the goal line.
	   ``We can now say that it probably was not a goal,'' British
soccer chronicler Philip Evans wrote in 1990. ``But to establish
that fact, it took a lot of people many hours of very hard work in
cinema laboratories all over the world.''
	   Dienst told an interviewer in 1989 that strangers still asked
him almost daily about the decision.
	   ``I gladly respond,'' he said. ``I still don't know if the shot
by Hurst in the 100th minute was in or not.
	   ``I have to say that I was standing in a poor position for that
shot, exactly head-on instead of diagonal to the goal. I wouldn't
have allowed the goal if linesman Bakhramov hadn't pointed to the
middle with his flag.''
	   Dienst is survived by two daughters.

Richardson says US will raise Eritrea-Ethiopia crisis in Security
</HEADLINE>
Council  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said
Friday that Washington is ``very concerned'' over the escalation of
tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia and would ``initiate efforts''
in the Security Council to deal with the issue.
	   Richardson spoke after Eritrean anti-aircraft guns shot down two
Ethiopian military aircraft that bombed an Eritrean air force base
Friday, a day after Ethiopia's premier agreed to a peace proposal
for their disputed border.
	   No details were immediately available on casualties.
	   ``The United States is seriously concerned about the recent
escalation between Ethiopia and Eritrea,'' Richardson told
reporters. ``The situation is getting very serious.''
	   Richardson said the United States supports mediation efforts by
the Organization of African Unity and ``we call on both sides to
start talking with each other.''
	   ``We will initiate efforts in the Security Council to deal with
this issue,'' he added without details.
	   In the Ethiopian capital Asmara, a U. S. Embassy spokeswoman
said plans to evacuate 200 U.S. citizens, mainly dependents of
government employees, non-essential embassy staff and Peace Corps
volunteers, to Frankfurt were going ahead as scheduled.
	   The air raid came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience was wearing thin because
of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia claims it
occupied a month ago.
	   On Thursday, Meles announced acceptance of a four-point proposal
by the United States and Rwanda to end a festering border conflict
peacefully. One of the recommendations was that Eritrea withdraw to
positions held before May 6.
	   Shortly before the bombing, the government of Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki issued a statement expressing ``its firm commitment
to a peaceful resolution of the crisis'' but it would never
``acquiesce to the language of force and intimidation and will, if
necessary, resolutely defend its hard-won right to live in peace
and freedom.''

  Rwandan rebels kill four in attack on main highway
  Eds: UPDATES with comments from a rebel spokesman; government
reaction in grafs 8-9; CORRECTS name of newspaper to Umucunguzi in
graf 7.
  By HRVOJE HRANJSKI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   TARE, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels killed four people, burned two
trucks and looted a local health center along the main highway in
northern Rwanda, witnesses said Friday.
	   The attack on midnight Thursday at Tare, 47 kilometers (25
miles) north of Kigali on the main road to northwestern Rwanda,
came a week after a shadowy rebel group warned of violence in areas
previously untouched by attackers.
	   Witnesses in Tare said a group of armed men ran shouting and
firing guns down the hills, surrounding houses and a restaurant
along the main road, before throwing petrol bombs at two parked
trucks.
	   The two drivers, who were apparently asleep inside, died
instantly. Another man was shot dead, and a local health worker
later died of gunshot wounds.
	   ``It lasted maybe 10 minutes,'' said Gerard Minigashura, a local
official. ``This is the first time they attacked here.''
	   Authorities in the capital, Kigali, were not available for
comment.
	   Last week, a rebel group calling itself People in Arms for the
Liberation of Rwanda warned of more attacks in a previously unknown
newspaper. Umucunguzi, or Savior, said the group was fighting the
Tutsi occupiers of Rwanda and their allies and urged Hutus to take
up arms.
	   On Thursday, Shyaka Komeza, who identified himself as a PALIR
spokesman, told the British Broadcasting Corp. Kinyarwanda Service
that his group was fighting for the liberation of the Hutu people,
and accused the Tutsi-led army of massacres.
	   The government in Kigali reacted angrily to the interview,
accusing the BBC of spreading hate propaganda.
	   PALIR was first heard of in June 1996 when it issued a
typewritten leaflet placing a bounty on the heads of Americans in
Rwanda.
	   Tutsi fighters took power in July 1994, ousting an extremist
Hutu government responsible for the genocide of more than 500,000
minority Tutsis.
	   Issue No. 4 of the Kinyarwanda language newspaper printed a map
showing half of Rwanda as rebel-controlled and said attacks would
spread to the central Gitarama and northeastern Byumba prefectures.
	   Last week, attacks were reported in Gitarama, Byumba and the
western Kibuye prefectures, but no details were available.
	   On Sunday, rebels killed a Presbyterian pastor and his family of
five in the northwestern Gisenyi region.
	   Meanwhile, a U.N. commission of inquiry into the illegal flow of
arms into the Great Lakes region arrived in Kigali. The four-man
comission was reactivated in April to investigate how Hutu rebels
were receiving weapons.
	   The rebels are believed to be based in northeastern Congo from
where they cross easily in and out of Rwanda. U.N. officials
believe the rebels may be assisted by a network of Hutu exiles and
businessmen in Africa and Europe.

Yeltsin: Russia-Germany to discuss ties for next century
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS 2 new grafs at end with spokesman saying relationship not
linked to elections.  

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Friday he plans to
discuss Russia's relations with Germany ``until the year 2000''
when he meets Chancellor Helmut Kohl next week.
	   The two leaders are scheduled to meet in Bonn on Monday and
Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin said he expects to discuss political, financial, trade
and social issues on his first foreign trip since a financial
crisis sent stock markets tumbling.
	   He said the main focus will be the bilateral relationship.
	   ``It is not simple,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``It was developed with difficulties and it will be more
difficult for us to advance it.''
	   Yeltsin's spokesman said the future relationship does not depend
on who wins Germany's parliamentary elections in September. Kohl is
trailing the Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor.
	   Relations between the two countries ``are being built up for the
long term and are supra-party in character,'' spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.

	   The 460-member lower house, or Sejm, voted 247-207 with four
abstentions against the plan to reduce the number of provinces from
49 to 12.
	   Some members of the Solidarity-led governing coalition, which
called for all coalition members to support the plan, voted against
it anyway.
	   The chamber was to vote later Friday on alternative measures,
possibly reducing the number of provinces to 15 or 17.
	   Under the reform program, to be introduced Jan. 1, Poland would
shed the remains of its communist-era bureaucratic system to give
local governments more power.
	   But people in cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals have protested the proposed reduction of provinces.
	   While the protesters fear a loss of control over governing
spending in their areas, they support the concept of administrative
reform and the goal of transferring decision-making power from the
central government to provincial and local authorities.
	   Buzek, who had hoped for a narrow victory in the vote on 12
provinces, said the issue was only one part of the reform package.
	   ``The number of provinces is the most spectacular issue, but it
does not decide on the whole reform,'' he said.
	   The reforms are part of Poland's efforts to transform itself
into a market-oriented, openly democratic society as it prepares to
enter NATO and negotiates for membership in the European Union
after more than four decades of communist rule ended in 1990.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new prime minister claimed Friday that
the country had emerged from its economic crisis, but President
Boris Yeltsin warned that renewed stability depended on his
government's ability to collect taxes.
	   The country's new tax chief announced plans for a crackdown on
the country's 1,000 richest citizens, whose rapid accumulation of
wealth since the Soviet period has been largely unimpeded by
taxpaying.
	   ``Well-known people should be examples for other citizens,''
Boris Fyodorov told the Kommersant daily.
	   The government also ordered five large oil companies to pay
their tax debts by July 1 or face confiscation of their property,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Russian financial markets collapsed late last month, and only
began to recover this week as rumors mounted of an emergency
bailout by the International Monetary Fund or the Group of Eight
industrial nations.
	   Top officials, including the new prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko, have repeatedly said there was no ``official'' request
for such aid _ sometimes stressing the word ``official.'' At a
conference in Ukraine on Friday, Kiriyenko insisted the financial
crash was over.
	   ``We have stopped the crisis and reached a turning point,'' he
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But some Western investors said the markets had regained
strength only on the assumption that a bailout was imminent.
	   ``Russia needs an infusion of capital,'' said James Fenkner,
managing partner of CentreInvest Capital Management in Moscow. ``If
it gets a big bucket of money, everything will be OK.''
	   After regaining ground earlier in the week, stocks declined
slightly Friday on extremely thin trading, with most investors
lying low until next week.
	   Many investors believe a bailout package will be unveiled
Tuesday, when G-8 deputy finance ministers meet in Paris.
	   ``If nothing is announced in Paris, you are going to see a
little bit of panic here,'' said Alex Pitaleff, a trader at
Creditanstalt Investment Bank.
	   No one disagrees that Russia needs cash, but some Russian
officials have been insisting the country could get by with
commercial loans and an improvement in tax collection.
	   Yeltsin said Friday that he had held phone conversations with
G-8 leaders who reiterated their confidence in Russian officials.
ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying that for the past year ``we have
been begging for nothing, asking for no money, because we know we
will have to repay it sometime.''
	   In a radio address, Yeltsin implored Russians to pay their
taxes. The government says fewer than 3 percent filed income tax
declarations last year.
	   ``The time has come to demand and punish, including filing
criminal charges,'' Yeltsin said. ``If we don't collect taxes, we
can't pay salaries.''
	   Yeltsin called on parliament and Russian regional governments to
trim their staffs to save money, and promised to shrink his own
staff by 30 percent.
	   Russia's top business tycoons, who met with Yeltsin earlier in
the week to discuss ways out of the crisis, issued a statement
saying they were ready to support ``all sensible steps'' to revive
the economy, ITAR-Tass reported.

Angola's former rebels angered by U.N., say peace in peril
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's former rebel movement Friday
expressed dismay at a United Nations report accusing it of keeping
a hidden army and warned that the claim could plunge the country
back into civil war.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said Friday's
scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Angola ``means nothing''
and is part of ``an international conspiracy'' against the rebel
movement.
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
was due to report to the council on the overdue implementation of
the 1994 peace agreement between the government and UNITA.
	   Beye said earlier this week that UNITA was hiding armed men in
remote areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the
movement's pledge that it demobilized its 70,000-strong guerilla
army.
	   Speaking by telephone from UNITA's central highland stronghold
at Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Luanda, Paulo
Lukamba Gato said Beye's report on the situation in Angola was ``a
bad mistake'' and ``very dangerous'' for the peace process.
	   He said reports that UNITA had armed men hidden in the bush was
based on unreliable third-hand reports and ``could cost the peace
process dearly'' by prompting the government to launch a military
offensive.
	   Gato said the government ``could take Bailundo in 30 minutes,
but we'd flee and then what would happen?''
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the southwest African nation's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to the bush.
	   Since then, the United Nations has slapped sanctions on UNITA in
an attempt to push it into compliance with the redrawn peace
accord.
	   Gato complained the Security Council was ignoring the former
rebel movement's legitimate concerns about handing over its four
remaining strongholds to the government.
	   ``We're not part of this (United Nations) club. We're guilty
till proven innocent,'' he said.

Stoichkov gives Bulgaria a 2-0 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hristo Stoichkov scored from a free-kick
in the 33th minute and gave the decisive pass in the 84th for the
second goal to give Bulgaria a 2-0 victory over Algeria Friday in
the last tune-up match for his World Cup-bound team.
	   Former Barcelona star striker Hristo Stoichkov led the team like
in the good old days of 1994, when Bulgaria captured fourth place
in the World Cup.
	   Stoichkov opened the scoring in the 33th minute on a free-kick
from some 25 meters.
	   He then passed from an indirect kick in the 84 minute to Ivailo
Yordanov, who scored from some ten meters.
	   Bulgaria's playmaker, Krasimir Balakov, created several good
scoring opportunities for his team-mates in the Algerian penalty
area, but they missed the goal.
	   Algeria's players showed good dribbling abilities but lacked
scorers to finalize their attacks.
	   Although Bulgaria controlled the game almost totally, its
strikers failed to convert the advantage into a better score.
	   Bulgaria will play in Group D at the World Cup along with Spain,
Nigeria and Paraguay.

	   IT WAS showtime at the Pyramid Ice in Sunway Pyramid when 21
skaters took to the ice-skating rink and showed off their talents
during the first Pyramid ice figure skating championships held
recently.
	   The skaters, the youngest being five years old and the oldest
42, put on their fancy outfits that invited shouts of encouragement
from the viewers.
	   One contestant even went to the extend of putting heavy makeup
and sprinkling silver dusts all over his hair and part of his face.
	   Another contestant, sporting mother Isabelle Tan, 42, took part
in the championship along with her son Napoleon Benjamin, 13, and
both won the second place in their respective categories.
	   Pyramid Ice operations manager Indy Wong said it was the first
figure skating championship to be held in the country.
	   He said there were three sections of competition - freestyle
solo, speed racing and spotlight - with the male/female, level and
style categories.
	   ``A majority of the competitors were from the Pyramid Ice
Skating School that started in August last year and one contestant,
Vincent Chew, five, was from Mega Ice Station in Penang,'' he said.
	   ``We might make the championships an annual event. Besides, for
next year between August and September, we plan to make a trip to
Hong Kong.
	   ``It is part of the Pyramid ice programme of sending its
students overseas that they can gain experience.''
	   Wong said Pyramid Ice planned to organise the Skate Asia
championships, a world class competition in which about 500 skaters
from Southeast Asia and United States of America would be taking
part.
	   Meanwhile, the top five places in the freestyle section were
filled by Vincent Chew, Tina Harlina, Bernard Lee Boon Kek, and Loh
Aik Shee in that order.
	   The speed racing category was won by Adrian Chow while the
spotlight category winners were Surayu Ismail, Emily Wu, Low Mei
Wan and Ivy Soo Mun Wai.

Company defends itself after boss accused of money laundering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A firm whose managing director faces Swiss
money-laundering charges in a case linked to former Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto denied Friday that any of its employees
violated any national or international laws.
	   Geneva-based Cotecna Inspection said it was having to ``bear the
brunt of internal political rivalries in Pakistan.''
	   A company statement accused the Pakistan government of doing
nothing about customs fraud totaling more than dlrs 650 million,
which Cotecna said it uncovered during a two-year contract in the
mid-1990s.
	   ``Cotecna Inspection SA confirms its determination to vigorously
defend its interests,'' said the statement.
	   Cotecna and its former parent company, Societe Generale de
Surveillance, lost their contracts to inspect imports and exports
from Pakistan after Bhutto was ousted from government in November
1996 on charges of corruption and misrule.
	   Cotecna's managing director Robert Massey was one of three Swiss
citizens indicted earlier this week on money laundering charges
linked to Ms. Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari.
	   The Swiss charges were initially announced by Pakistan's
anti-corruption investigator Senator Saif-ur Rehman, who was
present Tuesday when Judge Daniel Devaud announced the indictments.
	   Devaud later confirmed the indictments.
	   Cotecna said its five-year contract to inspect imports and
exports from Pakistan was ``unilaterally and illegally terminated''
at the end of two years after a new Pakistani government took
power.
	   Rehman showed reporters documents he gave Devaud, saying they
indicated kickbacks flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands from Pakistani
government contracts with Cotecna and SGS.
	   Devaud confirmed he would indict Zardari and intended to indict
Ms. Bhutto if he determines she cannot receive diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity. Rehman said the Swiss conducted the
investigation at the request of the Pakistani government.
	   Rehman said he does not know the full scope of Devaud's case,
but he believes more than dlrs 250 million are in Bhutto family
accounts in Swiss banks, which the Swiss government has blocked at
Pakistan's request.
	   Swiss authorities said last October they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts frozen in
seven Geneva banks.
	   Rehman said he expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks
in Britain and the United States. Pakistan also is working with
authorities in France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto
case, he said.

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Recasts throughout to UPDATE with Akinwande testing positive
for hepatitis B. Will be UPDATED after news conference, scheduled
for 2000 GMT.  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Saturday night's fight between heavyweight
champion Evander Holyfield and Henry Akinwande was called off
Friday when it was discovered that Akinwande had tested positive
for hepatitis B.
	   Two separate medical tests on Akinwande by the New York State
Athletic Commission showed he had hepatitis B, said Greg Fritz, a
spokesman for Don King Productions, the fight's promoter.
	   ``The fight is off,'' Fritz said.
	   The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
	   Hepatitis B and C cause serious liver problems. Hepatitis A is
typically a food-borne disease that can pass quickly. Hepatitis B,
often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic needles, can be
successfully treated, but not always.
	   The Showtime network, which was to televise the bout from
Madison Square Garden, also said in a statement that the main event
had been canceled due to the commission's medical finding
	   It was not immediately clear how the undercard bouts would be
affected.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included 46-year-old
Roberto Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   Heavyweight Ray Mercer, who was to fight on the undercard
against Jerry Ballard, also was suspended for medical reasons, said
Ralph Petrillo, medical coordinator for the athletic commission.
Petrillo said Akinwande was under a medical suspension, but he
declined to elaborate.
	   They were the latest medical suspensions to hit Saturday's card.
	   On Thursday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because tests
showed she is pregnant. Melissa Salamore was to have replaced
Garcia, but Martin rejected her as an opponent and promoters were
trying to find someone else to replace her.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to his career. He was
disqualified during a bout against WBC champ Lennox Lewis in July
for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was fighting for a piece of the title for the
second time in less than a year was due more to his choice of
promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle, promoter Don
King matched him against Orlin Norris, Jr., and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title. He was
openly unenthusiastic about fighting Akinwande, who is 33-1-1. and
almost nobody but Akinwande and the WBA wanted it.
	   ``There's no other reason for this fight other than he's ranked
No. 1,'' Holyfield said before the fight was canceled. ``That's
just what the rules are.''
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a
decision in Panama in his last fight after getting knocked down in
the first round.

	   THREE developers carrying out mega projects in Jalan Imbi which
led to a cave-in at the SRJK (C) Jalan Imbi have agreed to share
the cost of rebuilding the damaged classrooms.
	   Bukit Bintang MP Dr Lee Chong Meng said Berjaya Ditan Sdn Bhd,
Empire Legacy Sdn Bhd and Invescor Ventures Sdn Bhd had agreed to
do so following intervention by Deputy Education Minister Datuk Dr
Fong Chan Onn.
	   Fong had stated after the incident that the developers had a
responsibility towards repairing the damage.
	   Lee also said a cement batching plant in the area which caused
noise and air pollution had been served an eviction notice by Kuala
Lumpur City Hall.
	   He said he supported a recent statement by Datuk Bandar Tan Sri
Kamaruzzaman Shariff that all cement batching plants in the city
will eventually be phased out.
	   ``The directive that every major project should have a cement
batching plant at the project site is a step in the right
direction. This will help prevent cement spillage and road damage,
as well as congestion,'' Lee said.
	   The cave-in at SRJK (C) Jalan Imbi on March 14 saw three
students falling into a 1.5 metre-deep and three metre-wide
sinkhole.
	   They were, however, not injured.

	   THE parking area in front of Coliseum Theatre along Jalan Tuanku
Abdul Rahman will be turned into a mini-park known as Dataran
Lilin.
	   The project, to be undertaken by Kuala Lumpur City Hall, will
begin after the Commonwealth Games.
	   City Hall Urban Transport Department senior engineer Sabudin
Mohd Salleh said the park would have rest areas and a monument,
besides functioning as a green lung for Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
	   Asked what City Hall was doing to resolve traffic woes
highlighted by residents and traders along Jalan Masjid India, he
said a meeting had been held on the matter with members of the
Indian Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``The two problems in the area are traffic congestion and lack
of parking space. We decided to address the issue of traffic
congestion first,'' he said.
	   He added that several alternatives were discussed at the meeting
and a new revised traffic plan would be implemented by the end of
the week.
	   He, however, declined to reveal details of the plan.
	   Jalan Masjid India residents and business operators have
complained of traffic congestion caused by the one-way street
system implemented by City Hall in stages from March last year.
	   They claimed that the system had worsened congestion in the
area, contrary to City Hall's plans.
	   According to them, there were insufficient exits leading from
Jalan Masjid India to Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman as most had been
turned into one-way streets or converted into pedestrian walkways.

	   OWNERS of shops along Lorong Tuanku Abdul Rahman are crying foul
over Kuala Lumpur City Hall's decision to reserve all parking lots
along the stretch and at the nearby Coliseum Theatre car park for
its staff which has robbed the traders of a place to load and
unload goods.
	   As a result of this, some traders have been receiving summonses
every week from enforcement officers for loading and unloading of
goods at undesignated areas.
	   Carpet Plaza Sdn Bhd owner Jai Kishen Tekwani, one of those
affected, said he had been busy attending court proceedings almost
daily in connection with the summonses.
	   ``We are not going to settle the summonses which I feel have
been issued indiscriminately. We have been unfairly deprived of
proper loading and unloading bays by City Hall,'' he said at a
Press conference attended by Bukit BIntang MP Dr Lee Chong Meng.
	   He said the lack of public parking lots had also caused business
to drop by as 50 per cent, a fraction of which he felt was due to
the economic slowdown.
	   ``People prefer to shop at places where parking is available.
Our customers normally have large items to carry back to their
cars,'' he said.
	   ``We have been forced on several ocassions to send our staff to
carry carpets to customer's cars parked far away from the shop.''
	   He said on an average, 10 lorries loaded and unloaded goods at
his shop.
	   He said City Hall officers had also harassed his workers for
displaying carpets at the entrance of the shop which was their
property.
	   Lee said the traders had been gradually deprived of loading and
unloading bays after the City Hall Licensing Department moved into
the vicinity about three years ago.
	   ``All parking lots along Lorong Tuanku Abdul Rahman and in front
of the Coliseum Theatre have been turned into reserved lots for
City Hall staff and this is depriving the public and shop owners of
strategic parking points,'' he said.
	   Lee said there were paid parking lots along this stretch as well
as in front of the Coliseum Theatre previously.
	   City Hall Urban Transport Department senior engineer Sabudin
Mohd Salleh, who was present, said a meeting between members of the
Federal Territory Indian Chambers of Commerce and City Hall was
held on Wednesday on the matter.
	   ``We will give immediate attention to this matter and try to
find an alternative loading and unloading point for the
shopkeepers,'' he said.

clandestine nuclear help

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Stung by criticism that it set off a
nuclear arms race in South Asia, India on Friday accused the five
official nuclear powers of failing to curb clandestine transfer of
technology that resulted in threats to Indian security.
	   New Delhi also rejected any offer to help negotiate its dispute
with Pakistan over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Foreign
ministers of the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia
hinted at such an offer Thursday in Geneva.
	   ``There is no room for any outside involvement of any nature
whatsoever in this process,'' the government said in a lengthy
statement.
	   India set off five underground nuclear tests last month,
prompting Pakistan to retaliate with a series of tests two weeks
later. India had to build a nuclear defense because the five
declared nuclear powers did not meet their obligations under the
Non Proliferation Treaty when they failed to curb the ``clandestine
transfer'' of nuclear technology to its neighbors.
	   Both India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
the disputed Himalayan state of Jammu-Kashmir, which is now divided
between them.
	   New Delhi has held several rounds of talks over the years with
Pakistan to resolve the dispute, but little progress has been made.
	   India says the dispute should be settled between the two
nations. Pakistan, however, wants the issue to be taken up in an
international forum, believing it is at a disadvantage in
one-on-one talks with its larger and more powerful neighbor.
	   A separatist movement erupted in 1989 in Kashmir, where some
18,000 people have been killed in frequent gun battles between
Indian security forces and a dozen militant groups.
	   In Geneva, representatives of the local government of
Pakistan-held Kashmir welcomed the mention of Kashmir by the five
foreign secretaries, saying in a resolution that ``without a
permanent solution of the Kashmir issue peace in the region cannot
be guaranteed.''
	   Syed Ali Shah Geelani, head of a group opposed to New Delhi's
rule of its two-thirds share of Kashmir, also welcomed the Geneva
declaration during a speech at Friday Muslim prayers in Srinagar,
the capital of Indian-held Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's national government said ``the bilateral dialogue
needs to be supplemented by a broader multilateral process to
promote durable peace and security in South Asia.''
	   The Indian statement also reiterated statements made by Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that New Delhi will observe a
moratorium on further nuclear tests, take part in discussions to
ban the production of fissile materials _ plutonium and highly
enriched uranium _ and sign an agreement not to be the first one to
use its nuclear weapons.
	   India refuses to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in its
present form since it allows Britain, China, France, Russia and the
U.S. to keep their nuclear arsenals. Pakistan says it will sign the
CTBT only if India adhered to it.
	   In a related development, India denied as fictitious and
baseless local newspaper reports that it had struck secret deals
with Israel to promote its nuclear program. It said both nations do
not have any nuclear or missile technology cooperation.

Company defends itself in money-laundering probe involving BVI
</HEADLINE>
kickbacks  

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A firm whose managing director faces Swiss
money-laundering charges in a case linked to former Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto denied Friday that any of its employees
violated any national or international laws.
	   Geneva-based Cotecna Inspection said it was having to ``bear the
brunt of internal political rivalries in Pakistan.''
	   A company statement accused the Pakistan government of doing
nothing about customs fraud totaling more than dlrs 650 million,
which Cotecna said it uncovered during a two-year contract in the
mid-1990s.
	   ``Cotecna Inspection SA confirms its determination to vigorously
defend its interests,'' said the statement.
	   Cotecna and its former parent company, Societe Generale de
Surveillance, lost their contracts to inspect imports and exports
from Pakistan after Bhutto was ousted from government in November
1996 on charges of corruption and misrule.
	   Cotecna's managing director Robert Massey was one of three Swiss
citizens indicted earlier this week on money laundering charges
linked to Ms. Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari.
	   The Swiss charges were initially announced by Pakistan's
anti-corruption investigator Senator Saif-ur Rehman, who was
present Tuesday when Judge Daniel Devaud announced the indictments.
	   Devaud later confirmed the indictments.
	   Cotecna said its five-year contract to inspect imports and
exports from Pakistan was ``unilaterally and illegally terminated''
at the end of two years after a new Pakistani government took
power.
	   Rehman showed reporters documents he gave Devaud, saying they
indicated kickbacks flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands from Pakistani
government contracts with Cotecna and SGS.
	   Devaud confirmed he would indict Zardari and intended to indict
Ms. Bhutto if he determines she cannot receive diplomatic or
parliamentary immunity. Rehman said the Swiss conducted the
investigation at the request of the Pakistani government.
	   Rehman said he does not know the full scope of Devaud's case,
but he believes more than dlrs 250 million are in Bhutto family
accounts in Swiss banks, which the Swiss government has blocked at
Pakistan's request.
	   Swiss authorities said last October they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts frozen in
seven Geneva banks.
	   Rehman said he expects to find another dlrs 250 million in banks
in Britain and the United States. Pakistan also is working with
authorities in France, the Netherlands and Spain in the Bhutto
case, he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - DAP national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim
and treasurer Fung Ket Wing have been suspended indefinitely for
criticising the party leadership, creating a major split in the
party.
	   National publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong has been relieved of
his position.
	   The action was taken against Liew, Fung and Wee by the party's
central executive committee last night for criticising
secretary-general Lim Kit Siang at several party meetings.
	   The three, who walked out of the central executive committee
meeting which made the decision at the party headquarters in
Petaling Jaya last night, have been referred to the disciplinary
committee for further action.
	   Until the board convenes its meeting, they will remain as CEC
members.
	   In Malacca, Kit Siang told a Press conference the decision was
taken following complaints from the Malacca and Perak State
committees.
	   He said the Perak committee, at its meeting on Saturday, had
lodged a complaint against Wee for his remarks against the party
leadership at a meeting with the committee members, branch
chairmen, secretaries, treasurers and sub-committee chairmen.
	   Kit Siang added that the Malacca committee, at an emergency
meeting on Monday, unanimously censured Liew, Fung and Wee for
abusing their CEC positions to convene a combined branches meeting
on May 31 during which allegations were made against national and
State party leaders.
	   Kit Siang said the statements made by the three leaders were
uncalled- for and had undermined party morale, created confusion
and caused disharmony as well as disunity among members.
	   Asked whether last night's decision was unanimous, he said: ``I
do not have the details. I do not think we need to go into all
that. What I could say is it was a majority decision.''
	   Party sources said the three had, among others, criticised Kit
Siang's decisions and statements over his son Guan Eng's recent
conviction by the Court of Appeal for printing false news and
inciting the public.
	   The three had also expressed dissatisfaction over the roadshow
organised by Kit Siang to attract public sympathy for Guan Eng.
	   Liew, Fung and Wee declined to comment when contacted.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - Tenaga Nasional Berhad will spend about RM500
million to improve electricity supply and prevent frequent power
breakdowns.
	   State Infrastructure and Public Utilities Committee chairman
Datuk Ong Ka Chuan said the project would include the construction
of 20 new intakes and replacing of overhead cables with a
multiphase underground system.
	   He said the project, to be completed by the year 2000, would
ensure a more efficient supply of electricity.
	   The new intakes will be built at among others, Pengkalan, Tasek,
Menglembu, Tambun, Seri Iskandar, Gunung Rapat, Bercam, Greentown,
Jelapang, Gopeng and Sitiawan.
	   Ong said the project was a move to upgrade public amenities to
cater to the rapid development in the State.
	   Currently, he said electricity consumption in the State was 520
megawatts and this was expected to increase to 1,830 megawatts by
2000.
	   With the underground multiphase cabling system, Ong said if a
cable tripped, there would be back-up from another line.
	   ``This way we have a contingency plan to overcome disruption to
our supply,'' he said after opening the fifth World Chinwoo
carnival at Wisma Chinwoo today.
	   In another development, Ong assured that Perak had sufficient
raw water from the State's many rivers.
	   ``If the rivers are in danger of drying up, we can always ask
Tenaga Nasional to release water from the dams to fill them up,''
he said.

	   HONG KONG share prices dropped 2.9 per cent yesterday to a near
five-month low on a weaker US market despite easier domestic
interbank rates, dealers said.
	   The key Hang Seng index lost 260.79 points to close at 8,558.43
- the lowest since it hit 8,578.98 on January 15.
	   The index gained 2.6 per cent in the previous day's trade.
	   The value of turnover amounted to HK$4.511 billion, against the
previous day's HK$5.724 billion.
	   Following overnight falls on Wall Street, the market opened
weakly with the key barometer losing 213.41 points by the end of
the morning session.
	   Dealers said an easing of money rates failed to lift sentiment
given that local and regional economic outlooks remained poor.

	   EPSON Precision (Johor) Sdn Bhd, a member of the Seiko Epson
Corporation of Japan, is willing to relocate more of its operations
to Johor if such a move is feasible and reduces costs.
	   ``Our research and development will be in Singapore. But
whatever (facilities) we think can be transferred to Johor, we will
transfer,'' said Seiko Epson Corporation of Japan deputy president
Yuji Yamazaki.
	   He was speaking at a Press conference, through an intepreter,
after the launch of Epson Precision's 10th anniversary celebrations
by Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman at the company's premises
in Johor Baru.
	   Yamazaki was asked if the parent company in Japan had plans to
shift more operations from Singapore to Johor in view of the high
production costs in the republic as well as the group's vision to
diversify its Johor's operations.
	   Epson Precision, a subsidiary of Singapore Epson Industrial Pte
Ltd, currently produces watch parts, complete watches (Seiko brand)
and printer carriage shafts (Epson) for the export market.
	   Incorporated in 1988, Epson Precision expanded its premises from
a 0.8- hectare leased factory in Larkin industrial area to its own
four-hectare lot in Kempas Baru within a few years.
	   In June 1990, it set up its micro motor plant which subsequently
received the ISO 9002 certification from the Standards and
Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia in December 1993.
	   Epson Precision opened three new divisions in 1997: rotor
magnets (production), printer shaft (production) and complete watch
(assembly plant). In the same year, the micro motor plant was
relocated to China.
	   In January this year, the new tool shop started production of
tools and dies, jigs and fixtures, and machine tools.
	   Epson Precision currently employs 1,200 workers compared to
under 100 when it started 10 years ago, and 300 have been sent to
Japan for training.
	   Launching the anniversary celebrations earlier, the Menteri
Besar said Johor was proud to play host to a company which operated
value-added manufacturing and at the same time provided training
for the local workforce.
	   About 60 per cent of the parts and components for Epson
Precision's production and assembly lines are locally sourced.
	   Also present were Ghani's wife Datin Professor Dr Jamilah
Ariffin, Seiko Epson Corporation deputy president Yuji Yamazaki and
Epson Precision (Johor) managing director Sukenobu Koizumi.
	   Ghani later received on behalf of the State Government donation
of 20 Epson printers from Yamazaki.
	   Jamilah received from Koizumi a donation of RM30,000 towards the
Juita's (Association of the Wives of Johor State Assemblymen and
MPs) Tabung Sinar Juita.

	   THE Government will maintain its policy on power purchase
agreements (PPAs) between Tenaga Nasional Bhd and independent power
producers (IPPs) but will not object to a review of the policy if
both parties mutually agree to terminate the contract, Minister of
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Datuk Leo Moggie said
yesterday.
	   ``So far as the PPAs are concerned, they are contractual
documents between two parties and it can only be reviewed if both
parties agree to remove it.
	   ``If the IPPs agree, yes, we will review the PPAs but other than
that, any PPA has to be honoured and it is a policy that the
Government has to be consistent with,'' Moggie said.
	   He was speaking after opening Wisma City-Link in Shah Alam in
response to a statement on Monday by Tenaga executive chairman
Datuk Ahmad Tajuddin Ali that PPAs should be ``undone'' to allow
for a free market scheme resulting possibly in lower tariffs for
consumers.
	   Ahmad Tajuddin had said that the practice of PPAs was ``unfair''
to Tenaga and was in the way of realising lower tariffs.
	   Moggie said: ``For as long as both parties feel that it is
necessary to maintain that contract, our position is that the
contract has to be honoured. We have made similar assurances many
times before that this policy has not changed.''
	   The IPPs will hold a meeting soon to discuss the issue and its
association's honorary president, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, had said a
free market scheme would attract the best participants in the
electricity generation industry but concerns remain on industry
restructuring and reaction.
	   Under the PPAs, Tenaga has to pay the IPPs an agreed amount for
making their plants available for the generation of electricity.
	   Tenaga forks out more than RM2 billion to buy about 30 per cent
of the total electricity generated by the IPPs.

Print run of new Solzhenitsyn book to be doubled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The print run of a new book by Alexander
Solzhenitsyn will be doubled to 10,000, his publisher said Friday.
	   The decision was made after half of the first 5,000 copies of
``Russia in Collapse'' sold out on the first two days, Viktor
Moskvin told the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Russia in Collapse'' is Solzhenitsyn's second book since the
Nobel laureate returned from exile in 1994. The lukewarm reception
it received from the literary world was another indication of how
far his reputation in Russia has fallen since the collapse of
communism.
	   The new book, like his last, ``The Russian Question at the End
of the 20th Century,'' is largely an indictment of post-Soviet
Russia, which he sees as dominated by greed, corruption and
cultural decline. He calls for a return to tradition.

	   RUBBISH has always been a problem in Klang and unfortunately the
royal town has been known for years to be a problematic area where
this is concerned.
	   It's hard to pinpoint at anyone as it is a collective
responsibility of not only the Klang Municipal Council but also the
public to resolve the problem.
	   If the problem of rubbish is to be overcome in Klang, everyone
has to play an important role - right from the council,
houseowners, businessmen, petty traders and hawkers to virtually
everyone in the town.
	   Over the years the council has indeed improved the garbage
collection in Klang. It has engaged 63 private contractors to
collect rubbish on a ``three times a week'' basis from more than
150 housing estates in Klang North, Klang South, Port Klang, Meru,
Kapar and, in fact, in all the areas that fall within its region.
	   ``To ensure that private contractors do their job, the council
kept track of their routine activities. The errant ones were
fired,'' said council public relations officer Rosli Udin.
	   Rosli said garbage collection in housing estates had improved
and there were fewer complaints from house owners of rubbish piling
up at their backyards.
	   As for rubbish in town areas, Rosli said it was collected every
morning by council garbage lorries.
	   The biggest problem the council is facing is the rubbish thrown
at unauthorised sites along the roadside which indeed had become an
eyesore to commuters.
	   Rosli said the council had placed big rubbish bins along
roadsides for people to dispose of rubbish.
	   Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous ones, including lorry
drivers, who throw rubbish outside the bins and at unauthorised
sites making it difficult for the council to keep track of the
rubbish accumulated.
	   Rosli said there were 12 rubbish bins placed at strategic
locations in Kapar, Klang South (31), Pandamaran (10), Port Klang
(seven), Klang North (13), and Meru (six).
	   Rubbish in the bins are also cleared practically every day.
	   Rosli said lorry drivers carrying domestic and industrial wastes
had been repeatedly advised to throw them at the council's rubbish
dump in Teluk Gong.
	   However, he added, many did not comply with the directive and
took the short cut out by throwing it at the bins placed along the
roadsides.
	   To keep Klang clean and free of rubbish, Rosli said the people
had to play their part by discarding rubbish at the bins provided
and not throw it into drains and along roadsides. Garden refuse
should be discarded at authorised sites allocated in each housing
estate and all rubbish must be put into proper garbage bags before
disposal.
	   Petty traders and hawkers at day and night markets should also
throw away their rubbish at authorised sites and not into nearby
drains and at the sites they operate.
	   All rubbish from industries must be disposed of at the council's
dump.
	   With the Commonwealth Games just round the corner, it is
important everyone play his or her role in keeping the royal town
clean.

	   PENGURUSAN Danaharta Nasional Bhd (AMC), the national asset
management company set up to take over the non-performing loans of
the banking system, will be issuing quarterly reports of the total
value of non- performing loans and assets acquired from financial
institutions.
	   However, it will not publicise information on every asset
purchased.
	   This will be the AMC's public disclosure policy to facilitate
its commercial activities while abiding by existing banking
confidentiality rules.
	   ``But, when the assets acquired are that of shares in
public-listed firms, we will make the appropriate announcements,''
said AMC chief executive officer and managing director Azman Yahya
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He also said the AMC also has the option of acquiring loans and
assets that are not yet classified as non-performing.
	   ``If we see the potential for these loans becoming
non-performing, we would like to take them on quickly before the
situation worsens.''
	   The underlying guideline for the AMC is to see if the
non-performing loan can be restructured, and then, if extra value
can be added to the underlying assets via professional help and
management.
	   In a Press briefing at the Treasury, he said the AMC is
envisioned to initially have two separate divisions to handle the
NPLs and assets to be acquired.
	   The property division will overlook acquired assets related to
leasing, property management and construction management
activities.
	   The asset management division overlooks commercial asset
management (industrial, retail and hotel), infrastructure and
project finance, loan workout and restructuring, and non-real
estate asset management.
	   Asked if the AMC expects to have properties making up the bulk
of the assets to be acquired, Azman said the asset portfolio will
be balanced and the two divisions were just the initial set up.
	   ``The AMC will be a relatively organic organisation, with
professional expertise acquired as and when needed for different
types of NPLs or assets acquired.''
	   Azman reiterated that all acquisitions will be made on
commercial basis and not at fire-sale values.
	   As to how long the AMC is expected to stay in operation, he said
initial projections could be about 10 years as a number of
infrastructure projects are expected to be part of the company's
portfolio.
	   On future funding for the AMC, Azman said several options are
now being considered and it is expected to be a mixture of local
and foreign funds.
	   The AMC will be raising RM10 billion via the issue of bonds
locally and abroad.
	   Asked if the RM25 billion estimate for total funds required by
the AMC was adequate, he said this was the conservative figure that
was available now and could change later.

Clashes between army and civilians leaves three people dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The government sent tanks and troops into
southern villages Friday when citizens rioted after a motorist was
shot dead at a checkpoint, Yemeni security officials said.
	   Three people were killed and at least four wounded in the
clashes in villages near Ad-Dali, a town 250 kilometers (156 miles)
southeast of the capital, San`a.
	   The riots began after soldiers at a checkpoint near Ad-Dali
opened fire on a passing car at 2:30 a.m. (23:30 GMT), killing one
person and wounding another, the officials said. It was not clear
why the soldiers opened fire.
	   When soldiers tried to arrest people a few hours later, the
riots began again and some rioters were armed with firearms.
Weapons are not difficult to buy in Yemen, owing to the recent war
and the government's weak authority.
	   The army called in tanks and armored personnel carriers to take
control of several villages, the officials said. Many civilians
fled to the mountains.
	   The local province of Lahij lies in south Yemen, which was a
separate country until it united with north Yemen in 1990. The
south tried to secede in 1994, provoking a brief civil war. The
northern-based armed forces then took control of the south, but
continue to be widely resented.

	   THE driving force for trade and investment flows in the region
lies in an integration of Indochina economies into Asean, which
will then hasten the region's integration into world economy.
	   However, the founding members of Asean are going through a tough
economic phase, and new as well as future members need to know how
they fit into Asean's vision for the millennium.
	   Asian Institute for Development Communications executive
director Khairul Bashar said this at a seminar on ``New Members of
Asean: Dismantling Barriers and Facing Economic Challenges'' here.
	   ``What do they stand to gain from it, especially in these times
of crisis for Asia? They also need to clarify the framework of
Asean,'' he said.
	   The Indochina countries which are the new members of Asean are
Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos.
	   The three-day seminar which started yesterday, is aimed at
strengthening the media's role as a source of information on
business development, economic and political trends, government
regulations and corporate practice in the new member countries.
	   It is also to enable their governments to understand the
necessity of creating free market policies as a means of achieving
growth.
	   Khairul said there is resistance to radical reform as the
process of promoting private enterprises and opening up of economy
to competition, imports, and foreign investors is very uneven.
	   In this regard, he said, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam
enjoyed a significant advantage since ``they are not the first to
travel this road''.
	   ``As such, they can analyse the diverse routes taken by other
countries, and decide which features best suit their circumstances
and objectives.''
	   He also said that to be efficient, effective and sustainable,
Indochina's development efforts must centre on equally raising the
economic and social potential of both men and women.
	   The enduring strength of Asean families and societies is the
region's greatest asset because it provides a firm base for thrift,
hard work, educational success and social stability.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysian Institute of Economic Research deputy
director Dr Mohd Haflah Piei, in response to a point made by a
Cambodian participant that the country was planning to increase
tariffs on some 40 products said: ``The move was not appropriate as
it would dampen the member countries' efforts to liberalise trade
in the region by the year 2001''.
	   He noted that Cambodia, which will be admitted as an Asean
member in the near future, seemed to be wary of opening up its
economy to other countries.

  Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
  Ed: AMs; UPDATES with report of mass grave, new shortages; recasts
and trims.
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The latest Serbian offensive in
independence-minded Kosovo province produced reports on Friday of
50 dead, 200 missing, villages destroyed and a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   Hundreds more joined the thousands who have already fled the
fighting in the week since the offensive began, with most of them
heading for neighboring Albania. Some of them didn't make it.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so who trekked into neighboring Albania overnight had
reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people, said to have
died of exhaustion, and three small children.
	   About 10,000 refugees are now gathered around Tropoja in
northern Albania, produced by the largest exodus since ethnic
tensions erupted into large-scale violence in March.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources were often conflicting
and proved impossible to verify. Still, together, they reflected
the intensity of the conflict as Serbian government forces tried by
force to destroy the Kosovo Albanian drive to secede.
	   Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanians' main party, listed more than 50 dead and some 200
missing from the latest offensive, concentrated around Decani, some
70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Four villages populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed,
another eight badly damaged, and 16 others deserted by fleeing
residents, Cacaj added.
	   The Beta news in Belgrade quoted unnamed refugees from Decani,
as saying a mass grave on the outskirts of the Serb-besieged town
contained 300 bodies. There were no details.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leaders in
the province, said one Albanian was killed and two wounded in
fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
of Pristina.
	   It said Serb shelling continued in the Decani area and around
the town of Djakovica in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an Albanian woman wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts are impossible to verify independently, as both Serbian
police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ fighting
for independence _ block adequate access to journalists and even
humanitarian workers. Pristina-based human rights groups on Friday
warned that food and medicines in some blocked off areas was
extremely short and asked for international aid.
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro, which with
Serbia, forms Yugoslavia.
	   There were conflicting reports of Serb casualties, with Cacaj
saying three policemen trying to loot a house had been shot dead by
its Albanian owner, and the Serb Media Center denying any officers
were killed or wounded.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.
	   The clandestine KLA, which first surfaced in 1996, says the
peaceful principles of the top Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are futile.
	   A delegation picked by Rugova and officials chosen by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad
autonomy in 1989, opened a dialogue under Western pressure last
month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts. The Serbs showed up anyway for the talks,
to which Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is serving as unofficial mediator.
	   Hill noted that it is ``extremely difficult'' to get a true
picture of events around Decani.

Eritreans down two Ethiopian jets that bombed airbase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean anti-aircraft guns shot down two
Ethiopian MiG-23 fighter planes that had bombed an airbase outside
Asmara as the border conflict between two of the world's poorest
countries escalated Friday.
	   Witnesses saw several injured people being transported in
trucks, but it was not immediately possible to determine the number
of wounded or the fate of the Ethiopian pilots.
	   Two hangars were hit at 2:15 p.m. (1115gmt) at the airbase which
is adjacent to Asmara's international airport. A commercial
airliner on the tarmac was reportedle Ethiopian sOters (60 miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded
tank, artillery and mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked
Eritrean tanks that were moving towards Adigrat, about 20
kilometers (12 miles) west.
	   Both armies use aircraft, tanks and artillery supplied to
Ethiopia by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a four-point proposal put forth by the United
States and Rwanda to end the conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was
wearing thin because of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory
Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   Eritrea vowed that it would never give in ``to the language of
force and intimidation.''
	   ``They thought they would terrorize the Eritrean people, but it
worked the opposite,'' said Yemane Kifle, a business consultant, as
jubilant residents poured into the streets waving the blue, green
and red flags of their young nation after the fighters were shot
down.
	   A Canadian aircraft chartered by the U.S. Embassy left Asmara
for Frankfurt around 7 p.m. (1600gmt) with 191 people on board,
nearly all U.S. citizens, dependents of government employees,
non-essential embassy staff and Peace Corps volunteers, according
to the husband of one of the women passengers who asked not to be
further identified.
	   Another charter was being arranged to ferry out Britons,
Canadians and Australians, he said.
	   Shortly before the bombing, the government of Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki had issued a statement expressing ``its firm
commitment to a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
	   But it said it would never ``acquiesce to the language of force
and intimidation and will, if necessary, resolutely defend its
hard-won right to live in peace and freedom.''
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdrawn to positions held before May 6.
	   The Eritrean government statement Friday characterized the four
points as ``not controversial'' but said Eritrea believed there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out.''
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.
	   Eritrean rebels under Isaias' command were instrumental in
helping Mele's Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democractic Front
overthrow a 17-year military regime in July 1991.

New German government spokesman blasted for untactful commentary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ On the job less than two weeks, German
government spokesman Otto Hauser is quickly finding out what it's
like to be in the hot seat.
	   Hauser, a conservative parliament member and former journalist
who replaced former spokesman Peter Hausmann on May 25, was blasted
Friday by his own party for telling Germans in the new eastern
states not to bite the hand that feeds them.
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
faction leader in parliament, said Hauser should learn to formulate
his comments better.
	   Schaeuble also criticized Hauser comparing the PDS, east
Germany's former communists, to the Nazis.
	   In an interview with the Ulm-based Suedwest-Presse newspaper,
Schaeuble said he is against comparing right and left extremists,
because such debates ``can only lead to misery.''
	   Schaeuble was referring to Hauser's comments earlier in the week
that east Germans should not overtax west German generosity and
patience by voting for the former communists as they did in Saxony
Anhalt state in April.
	   Germans pay a solidarity tax equal to about 8 percent of their
income tax to help rebuild east Germany's economy after four
decades of communist mismanagement.
	   Hauser said he was only repeating what he as a parliament deputy
and many west Germans think.
	   Schaeuble said Hauser's warning to the east Germans about their
election stance could be misunderstood because of the way he worded
it.
	   Claiming to speak as a member of parliament rather than as
government spokesman was a lame excuse, Schaeuble said. ``I am not
for a parliament deputy being allowed to speak more nonsense that a
government spokesman,'' he said.

Security Council threatening new measures in Angola
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Alarmed at the prospect of renewed civil
war in Angola, the Security Council agreed Friday to consider
``additional measures'' against the UNITA movement unless it
fulfills all commitments under the 1994 peace agreement.
	   The president of the council, Ambassador Antonio Monteiro of
Portugal, said experts from the three countries overseeing the
peace process _ the United States, Russia and Portugal _ would
prepare a resolution for submission to the council ``as soon as
possible.''
	   Monteiro said the resolution envisages ``adoption of additional
measures if UNITA will not comply with its commitments.'' He did
not specify what those measures might be or when they might take
effect.
	   Last October, the Security Council imposed air and travel
sanctions against UNITA, in addition to an oil and weapons embargo
in effect since 1993.
	   He said the three observer countries had agreed among themselves
on the proposed measures but he would not discuss them before the
draft resolution was circulated to the full 15-member council.
	   ``This is a very, very serious situation in Angola,'' Monteiro
told reporters. ``We want very much to save the peace process.''
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
briefed the council Friday on the much delayed implementation of
the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement between the government and UNITA, a
former rebel movement.
	   Beye said earlier this week that UNITA was hiding armed men in
remote areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the
movement's pledge that it demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla
army.
	   UNITA has denied the allegation.
	   Before the council meeting, diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Beye would insist on new sanctions
against UNITA and threatened to resign if the parties did not
fulfill terms of the peace plan.
	   Beye made no statement to reporters after the meeting. Monteiro
said Beye ``had mentioned that possibility'' but said the envoy
``decided with courage that he has to assume his
responsibilities,'' meaning stay on.
	   UNITA's secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato dismissed the
council actions as part of ``an international conspiracy'' against
the rebel movement.
	   Speaking by telephone from UNITA's central highland stronghold
at Bailundo, Paulo Lukamba Gato said Beye's report was ``a bad
mistake'' and ``very dangerous'' for the peace process.
	   He said reports that UNITA had armed men hidden in the bush was
based on unreliable third-hand reports and ``could cost the peace
process dearly'' by prompting the government to launch a military
offensive.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the southwest African nation's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to the bush.

World Cup: English F.A. switches and backs Blatter
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: ADDS reaction from Johansson  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Football Association, after early
support for Lennart Johansson for the FIFA presidency, came out
Friday behind his rival Sepp Blatter.
	   On Monday, the FIFA Congress meeting in Paris will vote on a new
president to succeed Brazilian Joao Havelange.
	   ``After careful deliberation... England will cast its vote in
favor of Sepp Blatter,'' F.A. chairman Keith Wiseman said in a
brief statement.
	   The English F.A. had initially backed Johansson, president of
Europe's governing body of soccer UEFA, when he was the lone
candidate. Blatter, the FIFA general secretary, declared his
candidacy only a few months ago.
	   Johansson lashed out at Wiseman after the announcement and said
the F.A. had gone back on its word.
	   ``I think this is a very personal decision by the chairman of
the Football Association,'' Johansson said. ``Up until today, the
F.A. assured me they would vote for me. Obviously Keith Wiseman did
not keep his word.''
	   Johansson suggested a political motive for the change.
	   ``The fact is that Keith Wiseman lost his election for the
(UEFA) executive committee last April in Dublin and that he wants
to become the representative of the British associations in the
executive of FIFA,'' Johansson said.
	   ``I am disappointed that a UEFA association did not keep its
word due to personal ambition.''
	   Neither Blatter nor Johansson has backed England's bid to land
the 2006 World Cup.
	   Blatter, who believes he is the favorite to win Monday's vote,
said earlier this week he wants Africa to host the 2006 World Cup.
Johansson has favored Germany over England to be the European
bidder for 2006.
	   Johansson said he still had strong European support from Italy,
Germany, Spain, Portugal, Russia and the Netherlands and added he
expected to ``obtain the majority needed.''

	   JOHOR's efforts in promoting the Tanjung Langsat industrial area
as a centre for capital-intensive industries, in particular
petrochemicals, are showing results.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said two major
petrochemical companies from the US and Taiwan had acquired
significant land areas there for their new petrochemical projects.
	   They are among six big foreign companies which have shown strong
interest in setting up projects in the industrial area.
	   Dow Corning of the United States, which is involved in the
petrochemical industry, has signed an agreement to acquire 170ha
and plans to invest US$1 billion (RM3.9 billion), Ghani said.
	   He was speaking after opening Epson Precision (Johor) Sdn Bhd's
10th anniversary celebrations in Johor Baru.
	   Earlier, Titan Group of Taiwan, which is involved in the
manufacture of ethylene and propylene, had bought 40ha for phase
two of its petrochemical complex. The new investment will also be
worth about US$1 billion.
	   In addition, Johor Technopark Sdn Bhd, the Johor Corporation's
subsidiary developing the Tanjung Langsat industrial area complete
with a dedicated port, is negotiating with Taiwan Synthetic Rubber
on the sale of a 160ha site.
	   The Taiwanese company has proposed to invest US$80 million.
	   Ghani, who is also Johor Corp chairman, said these figures were
significant considering that even in the three years up to 1997,
Johor attracted foreign direct investments (FDI) of RM10.2 billion.
	   ``With the Titan Group, Dow Corning and others coming, Johor
will receive more FDI this year.''
	   Ghani said the Johor Technopark would continue to upgrade the
infrastructural facilities to cater to the demand of new
petrochemical plants.
	   So far, it has formed a joint venture with Malaysian Oxygen Bhd
to build and implement a piped gas system to directly supply gas to
the facilities.
	   It has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Tenaga
Nasional Bhd to study the possibility of developing, supplying and
marketing an integrated power supply package in Tanjung Langsat.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nine months after the death of Princess Diana, a
French judge gathered witnesses, paparazzi and a platoon of lawyers
under one roof Friday, trying to determine once and for all whether
photographers were to blame for the crash.
	   The all-day meeting wasn't expected to yield any immediate
results. But it was a way for Judge Herve Stephan, who heads the
massive investigation, to balance conflicting accounts in the case
file.
	   The high-speed crash in a Paris traffic tunnel last Aug. 31
killed Diana, her companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Paul.
	   Tests showed Paul was drunk at the time, and investigators long
have believed that is the main cause of the crash, in addition to
speed.
	   But Stephan still needs to determine the role of nine
photographers and one press motorcyclist, who have been in legal
limbo _ under investigation, but not formally charged _ for nearly
a year.
	   Many close to the case predict they will soon be exonerated.
Friday's meeting may have been a way for the judge to show, for the
last time, that he's thoroughly considered the charges.
	   It also was a chance for Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, and
Dodi's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, to come face to face with the
paparazzi.
	   Al Fayed owns the Ritz Hotel, where driver Paul was employed. He
long has blamed the paparazzi, and he railed against them when he
emerged for an afternoon break.
	   ``If I was not in a courtroom, I would hang them all,'' he said.
``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did. They were like
vultures around the bodies.''
	   He also had harsh words for Diana's mother, accusing her of
snobbery.
	   ``I'm an ordinary person. I'm a working-class guy,'' Al Fayed
said. ``She thinks she's the Queen of Sheba. She didn't talk to
me.''
	   But he praised the judge, who he called ``very compassionate and
precise.''
	   ``He uncovered many things today,'' Al Fayed said. ``Now it's in
God's hands.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd emerged from the courtroom during a break, but
waved away journalists.
	   Also present were driver Paul's parents. They, Al Fayed and Mrs.
Shand Kydd had the right to attend because they have filed as civil
parties in the case.
	   According to lawyers and witnesses, the judge took each
photographer one by one, asking him to describe his role that
night. He then asked his own questions, asked witnesses what they
had seen, and opened up questioning to all lawyers.
	   In one exchange, photographer Romuald Rat was questioned harshly
by lawyers for Al Fayed, who tried to establish that he pursued the
Mercedes that night.
	   ``I followed it. I did not pursue it,'' Rat insisted.
	   Ten witnesses were summoned, but only eight showed up. They
included the first emergency doctor on the scene, Frederic
Mailliez, and the first two policemen on the scene.
	   Lawyers said the policemen who spoke accused Rat of hindering
their work.
	   Another witness, private chauffeur Clifford Gooroovadoo, said
he'd told the judge he had seen Rat and another photographer,
Christian Martinez, fighting just after the accident. He said Rat,
after taking his own pictures, yelled at Martinez to stop.
	   The photographers are being investigated on two charges:
manslaughter, and failing to come to the aid of a person in danger.
Many believe that if anything, they will be formally charged only
on the second offense _ and only a few of them.
	   Nikolas Arsov, of the Sipa photo agency, said the hearing was
inconvenient, but he understood the need for it.
	   ``It's the 40th time we have answered the same questions,''
Arsov said. ``It's annoying, but what can you do? They have to do
their job.''
	   In contrast to previous hearings, all cameras were kept outside
the Palais de Justice. The gates were heavily guarded by police.
	   Investigators are still looking for a white Fiat Uno believed to
have brushed the Mercedes before it crashed. But they are said to
have given up any real hope of finding the Fiat.
	   And tests are still being conducted on the wrecked Mercedes
Diana was traveling in, but aren't likely to be finished before
October _ meaning the case can't be closed until then.
	   One person who wasn't attending Friday's session: bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash. He was invited,
but decided not to come.

  EU concerned about violence in Kosovo, studying options
  Eds: UPDATES with Blair comments in Vienna

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Escalating violence in the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo will be urgently addressed by the European
Union, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday.
	   ``After what happened in Bosnia, it is important for us to act
and act soon,'' Blair told reporters following a meeting with
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima.
	   Britain currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, and
has been discussing the Kosovo situation with allies, trying to
determine what action to take.
	   Many fear the explosive situation in Kosovo could lead to
another Balkan war.
	   After meeting earlier in the day in Rome with Italian Premier
Romano Prodi, Blair said the EU intends to send ``a very clear and
very strong message'' that it wants stability in the region.
	   ``It would be a very serious mistake for people to underestimate
our resolve and determination,'' he said.
	   Tens of thousands of people have fled a fierce Serb offensive in
Kosovo, a Serbian province where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the population. About 12,000 refugees have already
reached Albania and as many as 7,000 others have made it to
Montenegro.
	   More than 50 Kosovo Albanians were killed and about 200 are
missing since Serb forces began an offensive in the province a week
ago.
	   During his Vienna visit, Blair and Klima also discussed
priorities for the EU. Austria takes over the presidency July 1.
	   A key concern is economic reform, particularly, ``how we create
jobs and prosperity for our people for a new type of economy,''
Blair said.
	   Along with job creation, topics such as organized crime, drugs,
and the environment will be on the agenda at a summit June 15-16 in
Cardiff, Wales, Blair said.
	   The EU wants to ``help our citizens deal with some of the
problems facing our world today,'' he said.
	   In a visit designed to coordinate the hand-over of the EU
presidency to Austria, the two also discussed EU enlargement talks,
Klima said.
	   Earlier this year, the EU opened negotiations with Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.

	   THE Government will not regulate the rates charged by the
courier industry and will give a free hand to the players to decide
on how to develop the industry further, Energy, Telecommunications
and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie said yesterday.
	   He said the Government had frozen the issuance of new licences
for courier companies since the end of last year in order to allow
the 115 courier firms in the country to grow.
	   ``The Government would like to see local courier companies
taking their own steps to develop further. They are also encouraged
to take advantage of electronic commerce,'' Moggie said.
	   Earlier, he opened Wisma City-Link in Shah Alam, the new
headquarters of courier company City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   Founder and chief executive officer of City-Link Express David
Tan said the company expects to chalk up RM50 million in revenue
this year, up RM10 million from RM40 million achieved last year.
	   With 95 per cent of its revenue coming from the domestic market,
City- Link Express will still focus on local services as the
domestic market is still seeing growth despite the economic
slowdown, he added.
	   ``With the economic slowdown, the domestic market has
experienced a five per cent shrinkage in terms of shipping volume.
However, it is still a growing industry and remains an essential
part of the communications infrastructure to spur business
growth,'' Tan said.
	   City-Link Express moves a daily shipment of 20,000 packages
through an established network of 50 branches, two airport offices
and 50 express centres nationwide.
	   It also delivers to Southeast Asian countries through 50
overseas stations.
	   Tan said the domestic market for courier services was estimated
to be worth RM300 million with an expected growth of 20 to 25 per
cent next year.
	   To date, the company has invested a total of RM30 million in its
operations including RM13 million for the new headquarters, he
added.
	   The company has also invested almost RM5 million since 1985 for
its information technology system.
	   Tan said City-Link Express would spend another RM1 million in
upgrading all of its systems towards becoming Y2K-compliant, and
would also soon offer customer direct on-line services and
information accessibility via the Internet.
	   City-Link Express, with a total staff strength of 1,000,
delivers time- sensitive and fragile materials such as documents,
stationery, pharmaceutical products, computer hardware and
automobile parts.

	   MALAYSIA will resume borrowing from Japan in view of the
depreciating yen to finance private sector and government projects
in the country, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today.
	   ``This is a good time to borrow in yen. At one time, we stopped
yen loans because the yen was appreciating but now the yen is
actually depreciating and we have decided to once again accept
loans in yen,'' the Prime Minister said at the end of his four-day
working visit.
	   Dr Mahathir discussed this with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto when they met before attending a dinner hosted by Nihon
Keizai Shimbun Inc.
	   To a question, Dr Mahathir said the loans would be used to
finance projects, in particular environmentally-friendly projects
for which Japan provides special loans.
	   He said details were being negotiated.
	   Dr Mahathir said he also discussed with Hashimoto, the
importance of Japanese investment in Malaysia during this time.
	   Asked whether the Government, in reforming the country's banking
system, would consider introducing a deposit insurance scheme, he
said this was one of the many considerations.
	   He added the Government might have to think of unorthodox ways
of dealing with an unorthodox situation, including bail-outs.
	   He cited the decision by the United States Government to
nationalise Continental Illinois. For a country that believes in
free trade, to nationalise a bank was a radical step, the Prime
Minister said.
	   ``But when they are faced with a problem that can destroy the
whole banking system, they did not hesitate to use unconventional
methods. We should learn from them.''
	   On the criticism by International Monetary Fund deputy managing
director Stanley Fischer that Dr Mahathir's proposal for Malaysia
to trade in the currencies of the country's trading partner was a
retrogressive step, Dr Mahathir asked: ``What's wrong with going
back to something that was good?''
	   He said he did not think that his proposal for a reform of the
international financial system would be accepted by the powerful
countries of the west which were the ones ``making a lot of
money''.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  Ed: RECASTS, UPDATES with report of mass grave, new shortages.
Trims  
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some of the thousands fleeing the
latest Serbian offensive in separatist Kosovo province have died of
exhaustion. Other reports Friday said 50 people were dead, 200
missing, villages were destroyed and bodies were left unburied.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so who trekked into neighboring Albania overnight reported
five deaths en route _ two elderly people, said to have died of
exhaustion, and three small children. About 10,000 refugees are now
gathered around Tropoja in northern Albania, the largest exodus
since ethnic tensions erupted into large-scale violence in March.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources were often conflicting
and proved impossible to verify. Still, together, they reflected
the intensity of the conflict as Serbian government forces tried to
crush the Kosovo Albanian drive to secede.
	   Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanians' main party, listed more than 50 dead and some 200
missing from the latest offensive, concentrated around Decani, some
70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Four villages populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed,
another eight badly damaged, and 16 others deserted by fleeing
residents, Cacaj added.
	   The Beta news in Belgrade quoted unnamed refugees from Decani,
as saying a mass grave on the outskirts of the Serb-besieged town
contained 300 bodies. There were no details.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leaders in
the province, said one Albanian was killed and two wounded in
fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
of Pristina. It said Serb shelling continued in the Decani area and
around the town of Djakovica in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center reported an Albanian woman wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts are impossible to verify independently, as both Serbian
police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ fighting
for independence _ block adequate access to journalists and even
humanitarian workers.
	   Pristina-based human rights groups on Friday warned that food
and medicines in some blocked off areas was extremely short and
asked for international aid,
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro.
	   There were conflicting reports of Serb casualties, with Cacaj
saying three policemen trying to loot a house had been shot dead by
its Albanian owner, and the Serb Media Center denying any officers
were killed or wounded.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.
	   The clandestine KLA, which first surfaced in 1996, says the
peaceful principles of the top Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are futile.
	   A delegation picked by Rugova and officials chosen by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped Kosovo of its broad
autonomy in 1989, opened a dialogue under Western pressure last
month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts. The Serbs showed up anyway for the talks,
to which Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is serving as unofficial mediator.
	   Hill noted that it is ``extremely difficult'' to get a true
picture of events around Decani.

	   ENTREPRENEURS are being encouraged to venture into the
manufacture of machinery and equipment, currently produced abroad,
as Malaysia is largely dependent on the import of such products.
	   ``Total imports of various categories of machinery and equipment
are estimated at RM38.7 billion in 1997,'' Deputy International
Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Kerk Choo Ting said yesterday.
	   He was speaking at the opening of the Industry Tradefair
Malaysia 98 (ITM '98) and MachineTool Malaysia '98 (IMX '98) at The
Malaysia International Exhibition and Showroom, or Mines, in Sri
Kembangan, Selangor.
	   Kerk said the bulk of the imports comprised process machinery,
supporting services machinery, machine tools,
laboratory/testing/quality control equipment, material handling
equipment and packaging machinery.
	   Exports of such products were still relatively insignificant.
	   ``Machinery and equipment which are not produced locally will
continue to be imported and this offers considerable business
opportunities for local entrepreneurs.''
	   Investments in the machinery and equipment industry have been at
a steady level over the last five years.
	   For the period 1993 to April 1998, 475 projects were approved
for the machinery manufacture and fabricated metal products
industry, with investments totalling RM6.17 billion.
	   Foreign investments accounted for 58.1 per cent of the total.
	   Kerk said Malaysia would continue to maintain an open and
liberal policy towards foreign investments and encourage joint
ventures to facilitate technology transfer.
	   ``Foreign manufacturers are welcome to examine the investment
opportunities in the industry here.''
	   The ITM '98 and IMX '98, organised by Malaysia Exhibition
Services Sdn Bhd, act as platforms for local and regional
exhibitors to reach the international market.
	   The events have attracted 553 companies from 29 countries,
including China, Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the UK.

	   GROUND handling services company, KL Airport Services Sdn Bhd,
yesterday signed on its fifth customer and first major passenger
airliner, Emirates, the national carrier of the United Arab
Emirates.
	   Klas, which is a member of the DRB-Hicom Group, will begin
providing its services to Emirates when the airline flies into the
new KL International Airport in Sepang on June 30, a day after it
opens.
	   Emirates has been operating flights into Kuala Lumpur since
October 1996 and now flies four times a week between Dubai and
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Apart from Emirates, Klas' other customers are sister company
Air Asia, Kampuchea Airlines, Transmile Air and Federal Express.
	   Under the agreement with Emirates, Klas will provide four main
services such as inflight catering and passenger services
(check-in, transfers and ticketing).
	   It will also provide aircraft handling services (loading and
unloading of baggage and cargo, freshwater and lavatory servicing,
aircraft interior cleaning and aircraft pushback).
	   Finally, the cargo handling services will involve acceptance,
delivery, build-up and breakdown, transfer, storage and other
matters related to cargo documentation.
	   Klas director Datuk Maznah Abdul Jalil said the company was
making good progress in signing up five customers so far and that
it would continue to attract other foreign carriers.
	   Malaysia Airlines' own ground handling company currently
services all the national carrier's needs as well as for some
foreign carriers.
	   Klas was incorporated in 1995 as an alternative ground handling
services company. It is 60 per cent owned by Hicom Holdings Bhd and
40 per cent by Mofaz Aerospace Holdings Sdn Bhd.
	   Maznah said there would be 49 foreign carriers calling at the
KLIA, so it was up to the company to compete for those airlines.
	   She said that Klas' facilities at the KLIA was ready for
operation. The company had moved to the KLIA since the middle of
last month.
	   It has a capacity to handle 150,000 tonnes of cargo a year, as
well as an in-flight kitchen with capacity for 7,500 meals a day.
	   Apart from the KLIA and the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International
Airport in Subang, Klas has established offices in Penang which
will be opened by year end.
	   Plans to operate at the Kota Kinabalu and Johor Baru airports
will depend on the economic situation, said Klas chief executive
officer Sharifah Halimah Syed Ahmad.

	   METAL Reclamation Bhd registered a premium of 21 sen over its
offer price of RM1.80 when it made its debut on the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange second board yesterday.
	   By 9.06am, the counter, which opened at RM2.01, dropped to
RM1.90.
	   However, at mid-day the counter climbed back to RM2.01 with
64,000 shares traded.
	   It ended its maiden day at RM2.03 after surging to a high of
RM2.10 and reaching a low of RM1.90 on a turnover of 80,000 shares.
	   Managing director Lim Sheng Seaw expressed satisfaction with the
opening price.
	   Metal Reclamation is involved in the reclamation, manufacture
and sale of lead and lead alloy as well as the trading of metal
scrap. It recycles lead mainly from lead-acid batteries.
	   It is a holding company with two wholly-owned subsidiaries,
namely Metal Reclamation (Industries) Sdn Bhd and Metal Reclamation
Industries (Sabah) Sdn Bhd.
	   Lim was speaking at a Press conference after Metal Reclamation's
listing ceremony at the KLSE.
	   At a time when most businesses are consolidating, Metal
Reclamation is in the midst of building a RM63 million plant in
Pulau Indah, Klang.
	   Lim said the plant, which is expected to be on stream by the
second quarter of next year, would enable Metal Reclamation to
increase annual production capacity from 36,000 tonnes to 70,000
tonnes of pure lead and lead alloy.
	   The plant would meet the Department of Environment's Malaysian
Agenda for Waste Reduction (Mawar) programme specifications.
	   ``When the plant is operational, we intend to increase the
company's export from the current one per cent to between 20 and 25
per cent within the next five years.''
	   At present, Metal Reclamation exports to countries in the Middle
East and Northern Asia.
	   ``Before the regional economic problem began, we exported to
Indonesia.
	   In future, we plan to tap into India and South Africa.''
	   Malaysia churns out four million scrap batteries every year and
Metal Reclamation controls close to 90 per cent of its recycling.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, the company recorded a group
pre-tax profit of RM6.95 million on the back of RM203.88 million
turnover.

	   INFOCENTRE Corporation Sdn Bhd and Kulim Technology Management
Sdn Bhd yesterday signed an agreement to boost training, and
research and development in the northern region and to market
virtual library software.
	   The agreement formed a partnership to provide information
technology- based library solutions and related services to
organisations in Penang, Perlis, Perak and Kedah.
	   ICSB was represented by its director Gina Phan and Shahbudin Md
Saman while KTMSB was represented by its managing director Ahmad
Shukri Tajuddin and group general manager Mazlee Md Ramli at the
signing ceremony in Penang.
	   The virtual library software, called the VTLS (Virginia Tech
Library System), can be used to digitise images and texts for
access by tenants of the technology park and the public.
	   ``We hope to develop and execute projects for libraries and
information resource centres and to work together with consultants
and project managers for strategic accounts,'' Ahmad said, adding
KTMSB and ICSB would be working as partners.
	   The project, costing about RM2.2 million, would enhance the
facilities offered by the Kulim Hi-Tech Park in Kulim, Kedah.

	   KL Monorail concessionaire, PRT Sdn Bhd, will complete some
outstanding work before shutting down operations at the end of next
month and resuming work in November.
	   A company spokesman said the closure was to allow Kuala Lumpur
City Hall to carry out beautification of roads in conjunction with
16th Commonwealth Games (Sukom '98) held between Sept 11 and 21.
	   She said the other event requiring the company to cease its
operations was the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) Summit
to be held between Nov 14 and 17.
	   She said the monorail project was far from being abandoned, with
work including that for stations and piers going on at night.
	   ``Opposite the Lot 10 Shopping Complex in Jalan Sultan Ismail,
work is going on as we are putting up a station there,'' the
spokesman said.
	   ``There are several other areas where work on stations is being
carried out, such as the Chow Kit station at the junction of Jalan
Ipoh and Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.''
	   She said some work was going on at the Wawasan station at the
end of Jalan Sultan Ismail near the Vision City project on the
fringe of Kampung Baru.
	   Work is also ongoing at the P. Ramlee station near to the
Concorde Hotel.
	   ``The P. Ramlee station will be special because it will
interface with the Putra-LRT where passengers can alight from the
monorail and take the LRT at the Sultan Ismail (underground)
station,'' she said.
	   She said hoardings and barriers were still in place at Jalan
Maharajalela and the junction where it met Jalan Hang Tuah as there
was a station there.
	   Work started in the areas in January last year.
	   The spokesman said the rest of the work sites at Jalan Tuanku
Abdul Rahman, Jalan Sultan Ismail and Jalan Hang Tuah (near the
Pudu Jail) had been cleared.
	   She said before halting work next month, the company would fill
up all holes and remove hoardings at work sites as directed by City
Hall.
	   This is to allow the local authority to carry out resurfacing of
the road.
	   She added that when work resumed in November the company would
decide on the new completion date for the RM1.9 billion project.
	   The 16-km long monorail systemn will have 20 stations along the
way. It begins at Jalan Tun Razak bus terminal passing through the
city's Golden Triangle business dstrict and filling the ``gap''
between the LRT Sistem 1 and 2.
	   The monorail will pass Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Sultan
Ismail, Jalan Imbi, Jalan Hang Tuah, Jalan Maharajalela, Jalan
Sultan Sulaiman, Jalan Tebing and follows the Sungai Klang
alignment and ends at Kampung Pasir in Jalan Klang Lama.
	   A section consisting of four PRT stations within the Golden
Triangle is targetted for completion before the Commonwealth Games.
	   The first phase consists of about eight kilometres between Jalan
Tun Razak and Brickfields which will have 12 stations.
	   Phase Two will have eight stations and a seven km track running
from Brickfields to Kampung Pasir in Jalan Klang Lama.
	   It is initially expected to be completed by the year 2000.
	   The Government has agreed to give a RM300 million soft loan to
KL-PRT Sdn Bhd, the concessionaire for the monorail system in Kuala
Lumpur, to enable it to continue the project.

Mandela to visit both Irelands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela said
Friday that he would visit Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
after meeting with Ireland's foreign minister, David Andrews.
	   ``I look forward to visiting ... to see for myself what has
happened,'' Mandela was quoted on APTV video coverage as saying.
	   Andrews said such a trip would be a ``wonderful boost'' to the
peace process since the Irish benefited form South Africa's
experience in dealing with a divided nation.
	   On May 22, voters in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic
overwhelmingly approved a peace settlement to end decades of strife
between Protestants and Catholics.
	   Leaders from both sides visited South Africa in the years
leading up to the settlement to hear how South Africans are dealing
with a society that used to be split along racial lines.
	   Mandela's African National Congress officials were invited by
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the rebel Irish Republican Army,
in the month before the May referendum. They shared their
experience in convincing grassroots supporters to accept the
negotiated settlement that led to South Africa's first all-race
elections in 1994.

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim will announce the names of the members of the board of
directors and management of Pengurusan Dana Harta Nasional
(Danaharta) or Asset Management Co (AMC) soon.
	   AMC chief executive officer Azman Yahya said the AMC will
comprise a managing director (a portfolio that he will hold), a
chairman and seven non-executive directors.
	   Three of the seven non-executive directors will be from the
private sector, two will represent the Government and the other two
will come from the international community.
	   ``The independent board and management of the AMC will be
responsible and accountable for the agency's operations,'' he said
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Azman was speaking at his first press conference since his
appointment as AMC chief executive officer two weeks ago.
	   Anwar had on May 20 announced the establishment of the AMC, an
agency which will acquire non-performing loans (NPLs) and assets
from financial institutions.
	   Azman said the AMC's fundamental task will be the rehabilitation
and value maximisation of the loan assets it acquires at a fair
market value.
	   The NPLs and other assets will be acquired from financial
institutions following due diligence reviews to establish the
quality of the assets and their estimated recoverability.
	   It aims to have a balanced portfolio which will include
property.
	   Asked whether the portfolio will also include tolled road
projects, Azman said: ``At this time we have not evaluated any such
project.''
	   The due diligence review will ensure that only assets which need
strict criteria are acquired by the agency, and that the price to
be paid is set at a fair value reflecting existing specific
conditions of the assets to be acquired.
	   The due diligence process will also ensure that the agency has
sufficient information to assume responsibility for effective
management of the newly acquired assets.
	   This means that assets will be segmented according to
market-driven characteristics, such as special industrial sectors,
project types and other characteristics, which will assist the
agency in focusing the appropriate technical skills, experience and
resources on the maximisation of asset values.
	   Experts in reconstruction, rehabilitation and recovery of
distressed borrowers will be recruited by the agency to match the
composition of the acquired assets.
	   The specific characteristics of the loans and assets acquired by
the agency will drive, as in any market-focused enterprise, the
resolution structure and timetable for the rehabilitation of the
asset.
	   The agency's asset disposal process will be implemented
according to a planned and measured programme, guided by detailed
soundings of purchaser requirements for fair and transparent
resolution mechanisms.
	   Azman said the AMC's life cycle will depend on the assets it
acquires and on its asset specific resolution and workout plan.
	   It is reasonable to expect a longer term of operation for the
AMC, he said, adding that it can be operational for more than 10
years.
	   He also said the AMC will have its own building in future. At
present, the AMC operates out of Bank Negara.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - Former Inspector-General of Police Tun Mohammed
Hanif Omar will launch a book on the Malayan Emergency, God's
Little Acre - 1948- 1960, at the Royal Ipoh Club on June 12.
	   The book, published under the aegis of the Perak Planters'
Association, is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
Declaration of the Malayan Emergency, said R. Thambipillay who
compiled the book.
	   The publication of the book was made possible with the
co-operation of various people.
	   They include Capt Phil Rivers, a war historian and a member of
the armed forces during the Emergency; former Ipoh Anglo-Chinese
School principal P.
	   Subramaniam; former Kampar Anglo-Chinese School teacher Chye
Kooi Loong; and Perak Planters' Association chairman R. Sivalingam.
	   Besides focusing on those who sacrificed their lives for the
estates and mines, the book is also intended to be a tribute to all
who died during the Emergency.
	   The 180-page book comprises three major parts - the beginnings
of the Remembrance Day ceremony in 1980, a vivid narrative of the
Emergency illustrated with personal experience and testimonies and
a section entitled In Memoriam.
	   The book will cost RM20. All proceeds from the sale of the book
would go towards the Perak Planters' Association's ``Remembrance
Day Fund''.
	   The book will go on sale after the launching.

Salvador government blocks sister city effort
</HEADLINE>
  By EDITH BELTRAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A plan to make sister cities of
the Cuban and Salvadoran capitals has turned into more of a family
feud.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol announced Thursday that his
government would not allow a visit by Havana Mayor Conrado
Martinez, who was invited by San Salvador Mayor Hector Silva as
part of a sister city project.
	   Calderon Sol's party supported a war against pro-Cuban leftist
rebels in the 1980s. Silva was elected in a coalition that includes
those former leftists, now a political party.
	   ``We are brothers of the Cuban people, but what impedes foreign
relations is the line of the government'' of Cuba's President Fidel
Castro, Calderon Sol said in remarks published by newspapers here
Friday.
	   The hard-line Interior Minister, Mario Acosta, was even more
blunt earlier: ``No Cuban enters.''
	   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the central
government _ not the city's _ was responsible for foreign affairs
and noting the El Salvador has ``asked the Cuban government to make
advances toward democracy.''
	   ``We want to see a democratic government, not political
prisoners,'' it said.
	   That left former rebel commander Facundo Guardado, now a member
of San Salvador's city council, sputtering Friday.
	   The government behavior was outrageous, he said. ``They know
that large Salvadoran investors are operating in Cuba. The position
they are adopting now is absurd.''
	   City spokesman Juan Jose Dalton said the sister city agreement
would go forward _ but would be signed in Havana instead. He
insisted the pact is not diplomatic, merely cultural and social.

tickets,'' she said.
	   The screening of the movie will be at the Smile-UA Cineplex on
June 14, four days before its nationwide opening.
	   The patron of the charity show is Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan
Ismail, wife of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. She
is also Makna patron.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Nine months after the death of Princess Diana, a
French judge gathered witnesses, paparazzi and a platoon of lawyers
under one roof Friday, trying to determine once and for all whether
photographers were to blame for the crash.
	   The all-day meeting wasn't expected to yield any immediate
results. But it was a way for Judge Herve Stephan, who heads the
massive investigation, to balance conflicting accounts in the case
file.
	   The high-speed crash in a Paris traffic tunnel last Aug. 31
killed Diana, her companion Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul.

Stoichkov gives Bulgaria a 2-0 victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Hristo Stoichkov scored from a free-kick
in the 33th minute and gave the decisive pass in the 84th for the
second goal to give Bulgaria a 2-0 victory over Algeria Friday in
the last tune-up match for his World Cup-bound team.
	   Former Barcelona star striker Hristo Stoichkov led the team like
in the good old days of 1994, when Bulgaria captured fourth place
in the World Cup.
	   Stoichkov opened the scoring in the 33th minute on a free-kick
from some 25 meters.
	   He then passed from an indirect kick in the 84 minute to Ivailo
Yordanov, who scored from some ten meters.
	   Bulgaria's playmaker, Krasimir Balakov, created several good
scoring opportunities for his teammates in the Algerian penalty
area, but they missed the goal.
	   Although Bulgaria controlled the game almost totally, its
strikers failed to convert the advantage into a better score.
	   Algeria's players showed good dribbling abilities but lacked
scorers to finalize their attacks.
	   Bulgaria will play in Group D at the World Cup along with Spain,
Nigeria and Paraguay.

	   IPOH, Thurs. - Nine-year-old Sharmila Jeganathan who is
suffering from a hole-in-the-heart is in need of RM14,100 to
undergo elective heart surgery for her condition.
	   ``Doctors say the hole is getting bigger and she needs
surgery,'' said her mother M. Parimala Devi.
	   When she was diagnosed, doctors advised Sharmila's parents to
wait till she was six to have the operation. When she was six, her
parents were told to wait till she entered school as she would then
be entitled to the operation for free.
	   However, Sharmila's parents found out otherwise.
	   Now, Sharmila has been advised to go for surgery as soon as
possible and it has been fixed in August.
	   Shamila's mother is a housewife and mother of two while her
father Jeganathan Shanmugam is a general worker at the Ipoh
Specialist Centre, earning RM650 a month.
	   Those wishing to contribute towards Sharmila's operation can
send their crossed cheques, money or postal order payable to The
New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd with Sharmila Jeganathan written

Botha wrestled with old foe Tutu during past week

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Testimony from a member of South
Africa's black liberation struggle ended a week of courtroom drama
Friday in which a simple contempt case has turned into an inquest
of ultimate responsibility for apartheid's atrocities.
	   Nicknamed the ``Great Crocodile,'' P.W. Botha led the country
during the worst reprisals of white minority rule that saw 30,000
black activists detained and thousands more killed.
	   This week, he faced the moral might of an old foe _ Nobel
laureate Desmond Tutu, head of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the anti-apartheid leader who during decades of
struggle rallied world support against minority white rule.
	   Botha, 82, is charged with ignoring three subpoenas to appear
before the Truth Commission, which is probing atrocities committed
during apartheid. Since the first democratic elections in 1994,
Botha has insisted he has nothing to apologize for.
	   Testimony given by former underlings over the past week
publicized events and behavior that Botha hoped to sidestep by
refusing to appear before the panel.
	   Death squad commander Eugene de Kock _ now serving 212 years in
jail for murders committed while he was a security branch member _
scorned top officials like Botha for trying to wash their hands of
the violence.
	   ``They want to eat lamb but they don't want to see the blood and
the guts,'' said de Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the
nickname Prime Evil.
	   The prosecution focused on allegations that Botha and the
shadowy State Security Council, which he headed, coordinated the
crackdown on anti-apartheid activists and directly ordered bombings
and killings.
	   Cross examining Tutu, Botha's lawyer Lappe Laubscher said there
were no direct assassination orders in any of the Council's
minutes, indicating the killings were the work of ``bad apples'' in
the police and army who misunderstood orders.
	   An angry Tutu objected.
	   ``How many `bad apples' are you going to concede?'' he asked.
``No, no. We cannot now say that these are `bad apples.' They are
people who were sitting on the State Security council.''
	   At the end of his testimony Friday, Tutu make a final bid to
extract an apology from Botha in his quest to help the country heal
past divides. He directed the statement to the courtroom.
	   ``Can he bring himself to say he's sorry?'' Tutu said. ``That
would be a tremendous thing, and I appeal to him.''
	   For the Truth Commission, pursuing Botha has become a key issue
in gathering information about the SSC and deflecting criticism
from many blacks who say the panel is too soft on the former
oppressor.
	   However, after the adjournment, Tutu repeated his regret that
the case had to come to court.
	   ``There is no gloating,'' he said ``The TRC is not a vampire out
for blood.''
	   Afterwards, Botha marched across the court chamber to have an
animated and angry conversation in Afrikaans with prosecutor Bruce
Morrison, out of hearing distance of reporters.
	   His only comment for the media was that they should read three
books, including his biography, to understand him.
	   The case was adjourned until June 15, when both sides will
summarize their findings. Botha faces a hefty fine or even two
years in prison if convicted.
	   Botha was forced to resign in 1989 after 11 years as head of
state by ill health and National Party leaders who disagreed with
his strong arm tactics.
	   His successor, President F.W. de Klerk, freed Nelson Mandela
after 27 years in prison. Mandela's African National Congress won
the 1994 elections.

What the passengers heard: crash probe focuses on broken wheel
</HEADLINE>
  EDS: AMs; UPDATES with statement from federal railway authority, 57
still hospitalized, half of trains back in service  
  By TONY CZUCZKA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ The reason for the noise that rattled
some passengers minutes before InterCity Express 884 smashed into a
bridge is now clear: investigators confirmed Friday that a broken
wheel was the most likely cause of derailment and disaster.
	   The damaged wheel was located on the first car behind the
locomotive. Investigators didn't have to go far to find the
fractured steel rim that encircles the wheel, and helps keep the
train on the tracks. It had flown off and was lodged in the bogie,
the set of four wheels at each end of a car.
	   Another clue: A still unidentified piece of the train was found
on the tracks six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the concrete and
steel bridge that the fifth car struck broadside.
	   That piece _ and damage to both the rail and ties nearby _
corroborates passengers' recollections of noise and vibration two
minutes before the derailed train starting breaking apart and
crashed into supports for an overpass. At 200 kph (125 mph) the
train would have traveled the distance in less than two minutes.
	   ``There was an uncomfortable rattling and I had the feeling that
maybe something was lying on the tracks,'' Wolf-Ruediger Shliebener
recalled. ``People looked at each other, shocked.''
	   He said it stopped for a second. Then there was a crash.
	   It still isn't clear what knocked down the bridge. A broadcast
report suggested that the fifth car, the last to get past the
falling bridge, had knocked down a support.
	   But federal railway spokesman Jens Boehlke said it was
conceivable that the first car had struck a support, and that the
deck had not fallen down on the speeding train until several cars
had gotten through.The seven remaining passenger cars and rear
locomotive then jacknifed into each other,
	   More than 1,200 rescuers using jackhammers, cranes and cutting
tools worked around the clock to free survivors the first day, then
increasingly victims as they worked their way deeper into the
tangle of metal and shattered glass.
	   A body was recovered Friday under a 10-meter piece of road that
had fallen next to the train, raising the death toll to 96. Rescue
workers said they could not rule out the possibility that other
bodies would be found until the debris was cleared from the
four-track line.
	   By Friday evening, 19 victims had been identified and 57 people
were still hospitalized.
	   The wheel theory has not yet been proven, but is the focus of
investigators' questions. Still unexplained is whether the wheel
suffered metal fatigue, or some outside force.
	   ``We are extremely interested in researching the cause for the
break in the tire, and we will of course go after this with special
intensity,'' authorities said in a statement.
	   Boehlke said that in the seven years the high-speed InterCity
Express trains have been in service, there has been no similar
break or failure in the wheels.
	   An investigation _ being conducted by a special commission of
police, rail and other experts and supervised by prosecutors _ may
take months to complete, he added. It will include interviews of
surviving passengers and rail personnel as well as maintenance
workers.
	   The federal railway authority, which sets standards for safety
and service, issued a statement that said sabotage has not been
ruled out. However, no one has produced any evidence that suggests
any tampering.
	   ``Any suggestion of the cause of the accident at this point is
speculative,'' the statement added.
	   Joachim Haack, police spokesman at Eschede, said the findings
pointed to a mechanical reason.
	   The crushed train was one of the first generation of high-speed
trains introduced in Germany in 1991. The other 59 trains in that
group were taken out of service Thursday night for emergency
inspections, and half had returned to duty by Friday evening.
	   Steel tires require regular inspection and replacement because
of wear. Typically, a new tire is expanded by heating it red hot,
then it is slipped over the wheel disc and shrinks tightly to fit,
said Richard Gibbon, curator of engineers at the National Railway
Museum in York, England.
	   British high-speed trains may clock 1.5 million miles a year,
but the tires may wear out in 100,000 miles, Gibbon said. Trains in
the United States use a solid wheel with no removable tire, he
added.

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - National Economic Action Council executive
director Tun Daim Zainuddin today reminded State Governments to
carry out development plans that could assist the Federal
Government overcome the economic problems.
	   He said proposals and programmes to enhance agricultural
productivity and the tourism sector, for instance, should be
implemented without delay.
	   Daim, who is also Economic Adviser to the Government, said he
did not want the plans ``to be on paper only'' but must be
implemented immediately.
	   Chief Minister Datuk Seri Abu Zahar Isnin said Daim touched on
this during the State-level NEAC meeting here today.
	   The two-hour meeting, chaired by Abu Zahar, was also attended by
State executive councillors, heads of departments and
industrialists.
	   Abu Zahar said the State Government would revive the agriculture
sector by giving grants to the relevant authorities and agencies to
identify land for agricultural activity.
	   ``Daim wants the Malacca Government to place emphasis not only
on industrial development but also on tourism and agriculture
sectors.''
	   Abu Zahar, who is also State NEAC chairman, said Daim wanted the
State Government to re-develop agriculture land for commercial
farming.
	   ``I have directed the authorities to gazette agriculture land
such as padi fields. No form of development, except agriculture,
will take place on this land.''
	   To complement the effort, he said, a 300ha land in Selandar had
been identified as the State's agriculture park.
	   Aquaculture activity such as fish and prawn breeding will also
be expanded.
	   ``We will pay more attention to these activities by upgrading
the infrastructure.''

	   JOCKEY Ng Kim Chor, whose suspension of six months was increased
to one year after the Penang Turf Club (PTC)'s Racing Stewards'
reviewed their own decision for second offenders, will be back in
action in Ipoh this weekend.
	   The Penangite has successful applied for an injunction three
weeks ago and the additional six months suspension imposed by the
PTC's Racing Stewards has been put aside until the case is heard by
the court.
	   The PTC's Racing Stewards reviewed Ng's case after he had
completed four of his six months suspension for his handling of
Imperial Scholar and suspended him for one year under Rule 39 for
second offenders.
	   The episode started in July when Ng was originally charged under
Rule 144(a) and a 12-month disqualification was passed for his
handling of Imperial Scholar.
	   Ng was penalised for failing to ride the Charles Leck-trained
Imperial Scholar on merit.
	   The particulars of the charge being that from the top of the
home straight, at appromimately the 400m mark until the 200m mark,
he failed to make sufficient attempt to improve his horse's
position when there were opportunities to do so.
	   Furthermore, in the final stages of the race, he failed to ride
with his normal vigour.
	   Ng's appeal was heard in Ipoh on Aug 30 and after considering
all the evidence and submissions, the Racing Stewards were of the
opinion that a case under Rule 144(a) could not be made but there
was a breach of Rule 144(b)(i) and as such amended the charge and
found Ng guilty under the provisions of Rule 144(b)(i) and was
suspended six months.
	   The PTC reviewed Ng's case under Rule 39 after he had served
four of the six months' suspension and the two-time champion jockey
staged a sensational walkout, which was precipitated by the Racing
Stewards' dismissal of several preliminary issues raised by his
counsel, C.P.
	   Mahendran.

Patrik Sjoland, Stephen Leaney share lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARE, England (AP) _ Patrik Sjoland of Sweden and Australia's
Stephen Leaney tied for the lead Friday after two rounds of the
English Open, 9-under par on the 7,017-yard Marriott Hanbury Manor
layout.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, the first-round leader, slipped a
stroke off the lead after shooting a par-72. Also in at 8-under was
Ryder Cup teammate Lee Westwood of England and France's Fabrice
Tarnaud.
	   Westwood shot 68 and Tarnaud had a 66.
	   Leaney, who finished with a 69, looked like he was going to take
the lead outright but bogeyed the final hole and settled for the
tie.
	   Sjoland, who shot 67 to go with an opening 68, has been playing
some of Europe's best golf lately.
	   The 27-year-old Swede had five top-eight finishes in the last
six tournaments of 1997 and in the past five weeks has won the
Italian Open and tied for runner-up to Montgomerie in last month's
Volvo PGA Championship.
	   He has yet to play in a major and he's not playing in the U.S.
Open, but on Sunday night he could be Europe's leading money
winner.
	   ``I feel more relaxed now I've got my first title and it's
fun,'' said Sjoland, the latest in a steady stream of strong
Swedish players.
	   ``This is what I've been practicing for since I was a little kid
and to finally get up there is great.''

	   THE Perak Turf Club (PTC) will be the first among the three
Malaysian clubs to announce the weights of horses since the
Singapore Turf Club inaugurated the move starting from the new
season.
	   The general manager and secretary of PTC, Lim Yew Leong said
yesterday that the bodyweights of horses would be announced
starting from this Saturday.
	   The Selangor and Penang Turf Clubs have already said that they
will start announcing the weights of horses at their forthcoming
meetings in June and July respectively.
	   The Selangor Turf Club's next meeting is scheduled for June
20-21 and 27-28 while the Penang Turf Club will be staging its July
meeting on 4-5 and 11-12.
	   Announcement of the bodyweight of horses is a very useful
information as it is the best way to determine the fitness of a
horse.
	   The bodyweight of horses can serve as a guide to racegoers on
the local circuit especially now that all other three clubs on the
Malayan Racing Association (MRA) have agreed to follow the move of
the Singapore Turf Club.

England bowled out for 462
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with stumps score  
  By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England was bowled out for 462 one
minute before stumps on day two in the first cricket test at
Edgbaston when tail-ender Angus was caught by South African skipper
Hanse Cronje.
	   Fraser and Darren Gough, unbeaten on 16, frustrated the South
Africans for 27 minutes and scored 25 runs.
	   Medium paceman Gough, who took a painful blow to his right index
finger while batting, went for a precautionary x-ray for a
suspected break.
	   South Africa's decision to put England into bat badly backfired.
The Proteas now find themselves trying to save the game on a pitch
that is beginning to produce the occasional low bounce.
	   England's innings revolved around a brilliant century by former
skipper Michael Atherton and some invaluable middle order
contributions from Alec Stewart and Mark Ramprakash, who made 49
apiece, and Nasser Hussain (35).
	   Resuming the day on 249 for one, England made painstakingly slow
progress against an attack that had been culpable and costly on the
first day, but showed more discipline Friday.
	   England scored 72 before lunch and 61 in the second session.
	   None of the batsmen could make much of the ginger-haired Shaun
Pollock, who moved the ball alarmingly, but was rewarded with just
two wickets for 92 from 35 overs.
	   An outstanding delivery, a swinging yorker, accounted for Graham
Thorpe, sending the left hander's middle stump cart-wheeling.
	   England, 382 for six at tea, lost Ramprakash to the first ball
with the third new ball taken in the 170th over. The score was at
411 for six.
	   Fast bowler Allan Donald, sidelined for most of the day with a
niggling ankle injury, clipped Ramprakash's off bail, after the
right hander had held the middle order together.
	   Ramprakash's 194-minute stay included a 55-run stand with Cork
for the seventh wicket, after Mark Ealham (five) helped him add 27
runs for the sixth.
	   Cork, fell to a top edged cut to third man after a 61-minute
break for rain, before becoming first of Donald's two wickets in
successive balls.
	   Donald claimed Cork with the last ball of his 32nd over and had
Robert Croft caught behind with the first ball of his next to
finish with 4-95 in 35 overs.
	   After losing Atherton to the 10th ball of the morning, Stewart
and Nasser Hussain added 60 runs for the third wicket before a mini
collapse checked England's progress.
	   England lost 3-27 in 10 overs before and after lunch.
	   In the space of five balls, Stewart and Hussain fell to medium
paceman Lance Klusener and left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams.
	   Stewart, who had advanced swiftly from 28 to 40, suddenly became
bogged down and he needed 30 deliveries to score just nine runs. An
edge to first slip Cullinan off a Klusener delivery put him out of
his misery.
	   Adams was the pick of South Africa's bowlers claiming 3-73 in 35
overs, which included a 17-over spell that cost him 26 runs on
either side of lunch when he claimed Hussain and Mark Ealham.
	   Donald snared the wicket of Atherton, caught behind with his
fourth ball of his first over.
	   Atherton, having remained characteristically impassive on the
first day, failed to add to his overnight 103, and edged a catch to
wicket keeper Mark Boucher.
	   According to South African team physiotherapist Craig Smith,
Donald took the field after an injection on a troubled left ankle,
a recurrence of an injury that had troubled him in Australia early
this year.

World Cup: Azzurri slip into France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOUVEIUEUX, France (AP) _ Three-time World Cup champion Italy
slipped into France relatively quietly Friday, whisked away from
the Charles de Gaulle Airport by bus to their luxurious
accommodation at a castle-turned-hotel about 45 kilometers (30
miles) from the French capital.
	   One of the favorites for France '98, the Azzurri were bade
farewell at Rome by a crowd of about 200, mostly teen-agers, and
the players toasted themselves with spumante, wishing good luck.
	   The 50-person delegation arrived by Alitalia charter and boarded
a bus near the plane to a location to clear customs. Photograpers
and other media members were kept away by police.
	   The team then quickly moved onto their hotel, which the Italian
federation is paying 1.1 billion lire (dlrs 611,000) to house the
players during their stay. The chateau is surrounded by a large
park and a forest, has security at the main entrance and offers a
golf course, swimming pools and tennis courts.
	   The team is scheduled to go through their accreditation process
at the hotel Saturday morning before staging their first training
session in the afternoon at the Sports Center of Senlis, about 30
kilometers (20 miles) from its hotel.
	   The Italian team announced that it had cancelled a Sunday
scrimmage with a local amateur team.

	   MALACCA, Thurs. - Two men, whose bodies were found in a car at a
roadblock at the 100km Kuantan-Segamat highway on Tuesday, were
believed to have been murdered over a failed business transaction
with a group of Singaporean businessmen.
	   One of the victims has been identified as Syarikat Latem Metal
Industry Sdn Bhd manager Chai Cheon Keat    Peter, 30. Police
declined to identify the other victim - a Singaporean.
	   The 30-year-old foreigner, who police initially thought was a
local, was a director of the Malacca-based company.
	   Police have arrested two Singaporeans, including another
director of the company in connection with the killing, and have
requested assistance from Interpol to facilitate investigations.
	   State police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner I Arthur
Edmonds said today initial investigations have revealed that Chai
and the Singaporean were killed over business matters pertaining to
their company.
	   The victims may have had a falling out with their Singaporean
partners over the company's operations before they were killed, he
said.
	   ``We are also intrigued and puzzled as to why the bodies of Chai
and the Singaporean were taken on a 300km ride to Kuantan when
there are indications they were murdered at a house in Taman Cheng
Perdana in Malacca.
	   ``Transporting the bodies of the murdered victims in a car in
broad daylight is really puzzling,'' said Edmonds in a telephone
interview.
	   On Tuesday, a routine check at a police roadblock near the
junction to Bandar Muadzam Shah led to the discovery of the bodies
of the two men in a Kuantan-bound Toyota Corolla about 3.30pm.
	   The body of one of the victims who had a stab wound in the
chest, was found wrapped in a blanket in the boot of the
Malacca-registered car while the other, believed to have been
strangled, was found in the rear seat.
	   Police arrested the car driver and a passenger, both
Singaporeans.
	   It is learnt that in a follow-up operation, two other cars were
seized at a house in Taman Cheng Perdana, several hours after the
bodies were discovered.
	   Blood stains were believed to have been found at the house.
	   The bodies are being kept at the Muadzam Shah Hospital in Pahang
pending completion of police investigations.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - An Egyptian national was charged in the
magistrate's court today with assaulting a woman with the intent to
outrage her modesty by hugging her and kissing her on her left
cheek.
	   Ahmed Abdel Rahman Ahmed Mobarak, 23, a computer programmer, is
alleged to have committed the offence in a photocopy room at the PJ

	   No plea was recorded.
	   If convicted, Ahmed faces up to 10 years' jail or a fine or
whipping or any two punishments under section 354 of the Penal
Code.
	   Magistrate Rafidah Omar set bail at RM5,000 in one Malaysian
surety on the condition that Ahmed surrendered his passport to the
court.
	   The case was postponed to June 11 for an interpreter to be made
available.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Twenty-six of the 172 employees of HSBC
Finance Malaysia Berhad have accepted a voluntary separation scheme
offered by their employers.
	   Those who did not accept the offer will be absorbed by its
parent company, Hongkong Bank Malaysia Berhad.
	   Under the scheme, HSBC Finance offered its employees two months'
salary for each year of service or last drawn salary multiplied by
the months to retirement whichever was lower.
	   The offer letter was issued to the employees on April 27 and
they were given a month to consider it.
	   A Hongkong Bank spokesman said 17 of the employees who accepted
the package comprised those aged between 41 years and 50 years.
	   Eight employees are between 31 years and 40 years of age while
one is below the age of 30.
	   The scheme was unveiled following an announcement in March of
HSBC Finance's transfer of business to its parent company.
	   The move was in line with the Government's call to consolidate
the country's financial sector.
	   The spokesman said the package was offered to all HSBC
employees. Those not interested were given an option to join the
bank.

markets and between RM9.80 and RM10.50 per kg at the supermarkets.
	   Local beef and local mutton were only available at the Central
market selling at RM13 per kg and RM15 per kg, respectively.
	   Red water-melons were still cheapest at Ocean at 70 sen per kg
and most expensive at Jaya Jusco at RM1.30 per kg.

	   NAM Fatt Corporation Bhd is disposing of its entire stake in
Hong Kong investment holding company Bout Holdings Ltd to Gold
Heights International Ltd for a total of HK$240 million (RM120
million) cash.
	   The disposal is undertaken via wholly-owned subsidiary PN
Construction Sdn Bhd and is expected to provide an opportunity for
Nam Fatt to realise its investment in Bout.
	   Proceeds from the disposal will provide additional working
capital for the group and finance other investments, Nam Fatt said
in a statement.
	   Bout has a 75 per cent stake in Long Island Golf and Country
Club Ltd in Hong Kong, a 75 per cent stake in Dongguan Changan
Jinyu Gold Club Co Ltd (a joint-venture company incorporated in
China), and a 75 per cent interest in Top Smart International
Development Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands.
	   Gold Heights, a company incorporated in the British Virgin
Islands, is an investment holding company.
	   Meanwhile, wholly-owned subsidiary Nam Fatt Investments (Hong
Kong) Ltd is entering into a service agreement with Gold Heights
whereby Nam Fatt Hong Kong will be appointed project consultant cum
integrated manager for a new recreation cum golf course
development.
	   Nam Fatt Hong Kong will also provide management services for
HK$80 million for five years after completion of the earlier
proposed disposal.
	   At the same time, the disposal will result in a gain of about
HK$140 million to PN, while the Nam Fatt group will sustain about
RM6 million loss after taking into account the realisation of
post-acquisition earnings for the financial year ending Dec 31,
1998.
	   The proposals are subject to approval by shareholders of Nam
Fatt.

	   STOCKS slid into the close on Wednesday, once again failing to
sustain an early advance as the market remained handcuffed by
worries about company profits.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 87.44 points - or one per
cent - to 8,803.80, turning lower late in the session for the
second straight day.
	   Broader stock indexes also surrendered early gains and then fell
sharply over the final 90 minutes.
	   Without any major developments to clarify the uncertain outlook
on company profits, analysts say it's unlikely the market will
break out of its two-month rut any time soon.
	   While demand for stocks has remained strong enough to interrupt
any steep slide, the market has also been unable to build much
momentum amid mounting worries over how much the economic problem
in Asia is hurting US companies.
	   The Standard and Poor's 500 fell 10.29 to 1,082.74, and the
technology- heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 19.69 to 1,742.10.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,409 up, 1,594 down and 541
unchanged.
	   NYSE volume totalled 576.52 million shares against 589.22
million in the previous session.
	   The NYSE composite index fell 3.92 to 561.43, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.82 to 704.48.

US citizen suspected of smuggling Turkish antiques released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A U.S. citizen arrested in connection with
the smuggling of ancient Turkish artifacts was released on bail,
the U.S. Embassy said Friday.
	   Derek Fox, 42, was arrested Thursday along with four Turks,
after one of the Turks tried to sell artifacts to undercover police
posing as buyers, authorities said.
	   Fox, a civilian employee at the Incirlik air base, paid a 200
million lira (dlrs 800) bail, according to the Anatolia news
agency.
	   Police said he is suspected of overseeing the smuggling to the
United States, but the embassy said he had not been charged.
	   Fox was initially identified as a U.S. Air Force major, but a
U.S. Embassy official said he was working in Turkey as a civilian
despite being a reserve major. His hometown was not available.
	   More than 45 U.S. and British planes and 1,400 people are based
in Incirlik as part of the ``Operation Northern Watch'' mission
which patrols the no-fly zone north of Iraq's 36th parallel.

	   IN his speech at the Conference on a Social Agenda for the Next
Millennium, organised by the National Unity and Social Development
Ministry, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim correctly criticised university-level economics
education in the country.
	   In the context of the conference he was opening, he could have
highlighted the limited attention given to welfare and distribution
issues.
	   Unfortunately, his informants wrongly advised him when he went
on yet another of his anti-Marxist tirades, attacking another ghost
of their own imagination.
	   Regardless of the renewed interest in many parts of the world in
Marxist economic analysis, especially in the wake of recent
economic developments, it is quite well known that there have never
been courses on Marxist economics ever offered in this country's
universities.
	   In fact, there is little offered beyond rudimentary
neo-classical economics.
	   Even economist John Maynard Keynes has been effectively purged
over the last couple of decades, much to our loss.
	   Hence, there has been little intellectually-sound discussion in
Malaysia articulated against the rising tide of economic
neo-liberalism since the 1980s, in various guises, including
Reaganomics, Thatcherism, supply-side economics, etc.
	   Sadly, it has only been the painful trauma of the crisis since
mid-1997 which has opened up new debates at the international level
and forced us out of our previous smug self-satisfaction.
	   Anwar is right that we have to keep up with the new thinking in
economics, as in other areas. But if we refuse to learn from
history, we will be condemned to repeat it.
	   Keynes once noted that dead men continue to influence economic
practices through their intellectual legacies.
	   One might add that the fact that they are dead is rarely
decisive in determining their contemporary relevance.
	   Let us come to grips with our problems and not waste time
fighting the windmills of some paranoid speech-writer's mind.

	   NEWS about Muslims the world over these days do not apparently
present a true picture of Islam. Thus do they provide grist to the
mill for such as Salman Rushdie and V.S. Naipaul, described as
``Uncle Tom'' writers by Dr Farish A. Noor.
	   Once published in the Singapore Free Press in February 1951 was
a news item translated from Utusan Melayu with the heading
``Muslims told not to draw living things''.
	   The story: ``Drawings or paintings of humans and animals are
against the teachings of Islam. This was stated by Maulana Abdul
Alam Siddiqi, a Muslim theologian at the ninth general meeting of
the Muslim Missionary Society recently, in reply to a question by a
member who asked whether it was proper for Muslim pupils to draw
living things.
	   ``If drawing was taught in Muslim schools, the authorities there
should be prevailed upon from including such drawings in the
curriculum,'' the Maulana added.
	   The advice was not heeded as even then comic books, cartoon
films and comic strips in newspapers were enjoyed by everyone. No
Muslims become idolatrous.
	   Weightier matters crop up now. There is, for example, the
allegation by the All Women's Action Society (Awam) of gender bias
by the Syariah Court in Alor Star after sentencing on a 17-year-old
boy and two girls, one 15 and the other 18.
	   The boy was fined RM1,000 but the girls were sentenced to three
years detention for ostensibly committing the same crime and in the
same place.
	   Zaiton Mohamad Kasim, the society's spokesperson, said the three
years of detention during the formative years of the two girls
would leave an indelible scar on them.
	   There is then the serious issue of apostasy or murtad. Published
in Harakah, the official organ of Pas, was a complaint that a
private Bill which the party had drafted on the matter had not been
tabled for debate in Parliament.
	   The matter was cleared up later by Datuk Dr Abdul Hamid Othman,
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, who disclosed that a
law on apostasy being drawn up would focus on rehabilitative and
preventive measures.
	   Quote: ``The law will not be punishment-oriented but lay
emphasis on how to prevent apostasy and handle reported cases.''
	   The matter was being discussed at length by Federal and State
authorities, and the proposed Bill would also clarify provisions in
the constitution.
	   In the meanwhile, Pusat Islam is taking measures to check
apostate cases discreetly due to sensitivities as Malaysia is a
multi-racial and multi- religious country, the Minister explained
further.
	   As mentioned by a noted Muslim scholar, Ziauddin Sardar, there
is no mention at all in the Quran about punishment for apostasy.
	   Surely to be considered is the position of the newly-converted,
including those married to Muslims. How would the matter be
resolved if, for example, the wife is divorced and then returns to
her former religion?
	   To be looked into also would be the status of Muslims in
non-Muslim majority societies as in Thailand, the Philippines,
Singapore or India.
	   These and other matters help to explain why commentaries on
Islamic issues in Malay newspapers, especially tabloids, are more
pungent and emotional. And there are constant reminders about the
wrath of God.
	   Reported at length in Mingguan Malaysia recently was an incident
in a Kuala Lumpur mosque before Friday prayers when a religious
lecturer uttered the epithet kepala bapak (literal translation
``his father's head'') in reference to a persistent critic. The
report was headlined ``Mosque used to sound off grudge...''
	   Apparently the critic had earlier on blamed ``mercenary
lecturers'' for making facile commentaries on the economic woes
facing the country and the water crisis affecting areas in the
Klang Valley.
	   One had even claimed that they were part of divine punishment
following the dismissal of a senior religious official! But as is
also known there is drought in certain areas in Kelantan too.
	   No less controversial is the case of a Singapore couple, Abdul
Rahim Salim, 39, and his French-born wife Rahimah Abdullah (formely
Helen Vernet), 32.
	   Both had demanded an apology from the Kelantan State Religious
Department (Jabatan Agama Islam Kelantan or JAIK) following a raid
by its officials on the premises which they had rented in Kota Baru
despite giving prior notice on their marital status.
	   Their visit to the State was because Rahimah wanted to study
Islam, the syariah laws and their application in depth. ``She was
advised that Kelantan is more Islam than any other State in
Malaysia,'' one report explained.
	   Kelantan Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat was later
quoted as saying that the State Religious Department had received
incorrect information on the status of the Singapore couple. An
apology was, therefore, in order.
	   Reflected in all these, amid frequent reference to the wrath of
the Almighty, is the officiousness of certain religious officials
and the holier-than-thou attitude of some others towards
fellow-Muslims.
	   There is incessant emphasis on punishment now and in the
hereafter when, in fact, in innumerable instances, the ordinary
Muslim begins with Bismillah, in the name of God, Most Merciful and
Most Compassionate.
	   Helping to provide insight would be a visit to Afghanistan where
the Taliban religious police have tightened regulations. Some 120
men have been punished for trimming their beards and 90 women for
not veiling themselves properly.
	   Punishments were meted by the Department for Prevention of Vice
and Promotion of Virtues, according to the Taliban Voice of Syariah
radio station in Kabul.
	   Under the stringent regulations, women are forbidden from taking
taxis unless accompanied by a male blood relative. They are also
barred from wearing jewellery and high-heeled shoes.
	   Violators are lashed with a leather strap and a Taliban
policeman was seen to lash a woman five times for exposing an ankle
and wearing high- heeled shoes.
	   As officially proclaimed, Taliban authorities want to make
Afghanistan the world's ``purest Islamic State''. But, as is also
known, even Iran has expressed misgivings over the way the syariah
laws are being applied there.
	   Inferred too is whether what is being practised in really
Islamic.
	   More Afghans have been killed in the country's civil war than by
the Soviets during their invasion. There are now some two million
orphans in the country.
	   Compounding problems are the natural disasters which have
befallen the country and its people. Over 5,000 were killed in a
massive earthquake earlier this week. Some 3,500 died in an
earthquake last February and 1,500 more in February 1991.
	   The despatch of food supplies, medicines and other necessities
from several countries, including non-Muslim, has been swift and
prompt. It would not do for us to merely extend condolences and
sympathies, and talk about the wrath of God.

	   THE 2-0 win recorded by the Malacca Municipal Council (MMC) on
Wednesday against Johor Sports Council in the Malaysia Junior
League semifinal first leg has raised much hockey hopes in Malacca.
	   Malacca had been producing quality national players in the 1970s
and 80s and the many fans who saw MMC beat the Johor team, were of
the opinion that players from their State would be figuring
prominently again.
	   Indeed Malacca had produced such quality players representing
the national team like current national assistant coach Stephen Van
Huizen and other players of his time like Sulaiman Saibot, Tham
Chew Seng, A.
	   Kandiah, Eugene Kong, Teja Singh, A. Bathumalai and Colin sta
Maria.
	   Recent players include K. Embaraj and present national player
Mirnawan Nawawi.
	   Most of these players were the products of the Banda Kaba field
in Bandar Hilir which presently houses the Cultural Museum.
	   As a result of this development, the youngsters were deprived
for many years of a field and Malacca have since stopped producing
quality players.
	   However, since the long-awaited completion of the Taman
Perbandaran Stadium in Bukit Serindit, the MMC players led by Chua
Boon Huat, Zaharin Zakaria, Nizam Ahmat, S. Saravanan, Mirizwan and
Mihardy Nawawi may be knocking on the doors of the national team
soon.
	   At the earlier meeting between MMC and JSC two months ago, MMC
came back from behind to record a 2-1 win.
	   However, team manager Rafiee Mamat and head coach V. Sasitharan
who were delighted over the win, cautioned that there is still the
second leg to be played.
	   ``I am satisfied with the performance of my players, however,
they have to rectify several weaknesses including a jaded attack
who failed to capitalise on the chances that came their way,'' said
Rafiee.

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>

scheduled for 2000 GMT.

  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield never really wanted to fight
Henry Akinwande. Now he won't have to.
	   The heavyweight title fight was called off Friday, a day before
the bout, because Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B.
	   Heavyweight Ray Mercer was also scratched from the card for
undisclosed medical reasons, and Christy Martin's opponent can't
fight because she's pregnant.
	   Promoters scheduled a Friday afternoon news conference to
discuss whether the card will go forward at all, with aging Roberto
Duran the remaining attraction.
	   Two separate medical tests on Akinwande by the New York State
Athletic Commission showed he had hepatitis B, said Greg Fritz, a
spokesman for Don King Productions, the promoter of the fight.
	   ``The fight is off,'' Fritz said.
	   The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
	   Hepatitis B, often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic
needles, can cause serious liver problems. The disease can be
treated successfully, but not always. Hepatitis A is typically a
food-borne disease that can pass quickly.
	   The Showtime network, which was to televise the bout from
Madison Square Garden, also said in a statement that the main event
had been canceled due to the commission's medical finding.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included the
46-year-old Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   On Thursday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because she's
pregnant. Melissa Salamore was to have replaced Garcia, but Martin
rejected her as an opponent and promoters were trying to find
another fighter.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to his once-promising
career. He was disqualified in the fifth round of a fight last July
against WBC champ Lennox Lewis for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was even supposed to fight for a piece of the
title for the second time in less than a year was due more to his
choice of promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle,
promoter Don King matched him against Orlin Norris Jr., and
Akinwande won a 12-round decision to become the mandatory
contender.
	   Akinwande was to make dlrs 2.5 million to fight Holyfield, who
was to get dlrs 10 million for the defense of the WBA title he won
in his first fight with Mike Tyson.
	   Holyfield had wanted to fight Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title. He was
openly unenthusiastic about fighting Akinwande, who is 33-1-1, and
almost nobody but Akinwande and the WBA wanted it.
	   ``There's no other reason for this fight other than he's ranked
No. 1,'' Holyfield said before the fight was canceled. ``That's
just what the rules are.''
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Land and Co-operative Development
Minister Datuk Osu Sukam will be appointed Sabah Deputy Chief
Minister and Finance Minister.
	   Confirming this today, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim said the appointment would take effect from Monday.
	   Speaking at a Press conference to announce details of the
Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd at the Finance Ministry, Anwar
said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad had agreed to
the appointment.
	   ``Datuk Osu will resign (from his Federal post) before Monday,''
he said when asked by reporters to confirm news report today that
Osu had resigned.
	   Osu is the Sabah Umno liaison committee chairman, MP for Papar
as well as the Kawang State Assemblyman.
	   He is taking up the post vacated by Datuk Ghapur Salleh who
declined to be reappointed when the State Cabinet was reshuffled
following the appointment of Tan Sri Bernard Dompok as Chief
Minister of Sabah.
	   On Osu's replacement, Anwar said the matter was the prerogative
of Dr Mahathir as Prime Minister.
	   He declined to comment on whether former Chief Minister and Kota
Belud MP Datuk Salleh Said would replace Osu.
	   Meanwhile, Bernama quotes Osu as saying he is returning to State
politics to further strengthen the Barisan Nasional for the next
State election.
	   ``This is what the party leadership wants after taking into
account what has happened and it is an important duty in the
interests of the party and Sabah,'' he said in an interview.
	   He said he would make full use of his 12 years' experience at
the Federal level, including four as a Cabinet Minister, which had
matured him, especially in viewing each issue from the national
angle and not from the State or narrow angle.
	   Osu said his experience as a Cabinet Minister under Dr
Mahathir's leadership was valuable and an honour, and had honed his
administrative skills and matured his thinking.
	   ``Where previously, before to coming to Kuala Lumpur, I had
thought only of what was good for Sabah, now I am more matured in
looking at the needs of a multiracial society,'' he said.
	   ``We must not be narrow-minded in thinking only what is good for
ourselves, our community or race ... the interests of others must
also be considered,'' he said.

	   THE National Junior League semifinals second leg look like
foregone conclusions, but Electrical Switchgear Automation (ESA)
and Johor Sports Council (JSC) beg to differ.
	   On Wednesday, Old La Sallians of Klang (Olak) beat ESA 5-2 while
Malacca Municipal Council (MMC) beat JSC 2-0.
	   But since the no-offside ruling came into efect, Olak and MMC
will have to produce better hockey to reach the final.
	   Olak are an interesting team to watch but once they take a
commanding lead, their players tend to take things for granted and
this could spell trouble for them.
	   ``Yes, I admit that we could have beaten ESA by about eight
goals in the first leg and confirm our place in the final on
Sunday. But once we were 5-0 up, the players started relaxing and
ESA scored two quick goals to cushion the return leg,'' said Olak
assistant manager Joseph de Silva.
	   Syayrim Uda Karim will surely be a marked man when Olak journey
to Universiti Sains Malaysia for the return leg today for he has
scored 18 goals in the tournament and is the clear winner of the
Topscorers Award.
	   But Olak are a well rounded side and many in their forwardline
can score.
	   Marking out Syayrim will not be enough.
	   ``I have many juniors in the side and this is actually a side
for the future. A defeat will not break hearts but Olak better come
prepared because the USM pitch has always brought luck to us. We
are still in the running,'' said ESA team manager S. Kali Kavandan.
	   Kali has three 14-year-olds in his side, including his son Mano
Raj.
	   JSC, one of the early favourites, lost much of their bite when a
few of their players received offers to further their studies but
losing 2-0 in Malacca is no great shakes.
	   ``We have to do better during the penalty corners to beat a side
like Malacca,''said JSC coach Balbir Singh.
	   Today - s-final return leg: ESA v Olak (Universiti Sains
Malaysia, 5.0), JSC v MMC (Tun Razak Stadium, 5.0); Sunday - Final:
(Tun Razak Stadium, 5.0).

	   THE Malaysian Handball Association were the only national
association who have yet to register with the office of the
Commissioner of Sports.
	   Under the Sports Development Act 1997, all sports bodies who
previously were registered with the Registrar of Societies had to
transfer their registration to the Commissioner.
	   Deadline for the new registration which was extended by two
months ended on May 31.
	   The other 72 national sports bodies were among the 761 or 65
percent of the sports bodies and associations in West Malaysia who
registered with the Commisioner.
	   Said Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, ``Those who are
not registered with the Commissioner are not allowed to oganise or
compete in any activities.
	   ``However, being sports friendly, these associations can still
send their applications to the Commissioner. However, they must
give concrete reasons for delaying their application.''
	   He said sports bodies and associations, who have failed to
submit their applications to the Sports Commissioner's office,
would be considered not in existence and not eligible to receive
financial allocations from the Government.
	   ``They will also be not allowed to organise, participate or
represent Malaysia in any sporting event,'' he said after
witnessing the handing over of files of sports organisations by the
Registrar of Societies to the Sports Commissioner's Office.
	   The Registrar of Societies, Mohiyaddin Mohamed Jan, the
Commissioner of Sports, Datuk Ahmad Bakri Shabdin who is also
Secretary General the Sports Ministry, and Deputy Home Minister
Datuk Ong Ka Ting attended the function.
	   Giving a breakdown of the registered sports bodies, Muhyiddin
said 72 of them were national sports bodies, 358 state-level
organisations while 331 were district sports associations and
organisations.
	   ``According to the law the associations who failed to register
are not legitmate. We had already given sufficient reminders to
them. Now we will establish their status,'' he said.
	   Muhyiddin believed many of the sports associations and
organisations took the registration requirement lightly and there
were also those who had failed to hold their meetings and were
inactive.
	   The Act did not affect sports organisation in Labuan, Sabah and
Sarawak.
	   Muhyiddin said a national sports convention would be held as
soon as possible to discuss the future direction and method of how
the administration and development of sports in the country should
be planned and implemented.

	   A COUNTRY'S competitive edge in the next millennium, as we have
often been reminded, will no longer be determined by traditional
elements such as natural resources and labour-capital ratio.
Instead, it will depend much on the level of technological skills
and research and development ability.
	   Ingenuity and creativity will be the deciding factors in the era
of information technology and globalisation.
	   Thus, the importance of education and training cannot be
overemphasised in Malaysia's effort to achieve industrialised
nation status by the year 2020. It is heartening that while in the
present difficult times a reduced national Budget poses a challenge
to the authorities, there is awareness that the country cannot
afford to neglect these two vital areas in the critical Seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000). This is taking cognizance of the fact
that Malaysia is facing a shortage of technical and scientific
manpower.
	   The Education Ministry's Thursday announcement that a total of
42,584 government school candidates who sat for the Sijil Pelajaran
Malaysia last year have been offered places in Form Six is
undoubtedly a much welcomed move. While the sharp intake increase
of almost 55 per cent over last year's figure is attributed to the
large number of students opting to study locally and to better
results, it is clear that the ministry is making every effort to
accommodate as many eligible students as possible.
	   All students who meet the minimum requirements will be allowed
to enter Form Six. State education departments have been directed
to co-ordinate the matter with schools. If necessary, adjustments
will be made.
	   With the rapid changes in the global environment, the ministry
recognises the need to enhance the capability of the national
education system to move in chorus with the demand of changes and
new challenges, particularly in science and technology. The
preponderance of science students over those in the Arts this time,
56.4 against 43.6 per cent, is in line with the effort to encourage
more to enter this area of study.
	   In the wake of the country's opening up of educational
opportunities in both the public and private sectors, which is a
right step in producing the skilled manpower required, it is
imperative that quality be maintained at all times. Quality must
never be sacrificed at the altar of quantity and pecuniary
considerations. There can be no compromise in this if the nation
wishes to turn its dream of making Malaysia an international centre
of learning excellence into a reality. Malaysia must not go the way
of some countries, including certain advanced ones, where the
proliferation of worthless institutions of higher learning has
tarnished otherwise fine reputations.
	   Educationists are anxious to point out the significance of Form
Six classes as they form the bridge between the secondary and
tertiary levels of education. Besides adequate physical facilities
and equipment, qualified and suitable teachers are essential in
providing the students with the necessary foundation for higher
studies. The Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia examination is one
of the toughest in our system and much is demanded of the teachers.
There is a need to be well equipped through constant updating to
ensure the essential breadth and depth for the challenging task of
developing not just independent but critical thinking in their
students. Therein lies the onerous task of the Education Ministry.

	   OUR education system, especially at the post-school level, has
become rather big, clumsy and unwieldy - and may have even grown
out of hand.
	   The administrative unit within the Ministry of Education that
handles admissions to the local higher education institutions has
just learned this.
	   The variety of programmes available, the different entry level
set for each programme, the types of entry qualifications
recognised, the combination of subjects required, and other
variables involved, are simply too much for the unit's
sophisticated computers to handle.
	   A debacle ensued in the process of offering places to students
recently and the Minister of Education had to apologise publicly to
applicants.
	   For the moment, blame is conveniently placed at the door of the
admissions unit for its ``lack of competence'' in dealing with the
increase in the number of applicants and in managing the computer
system - skills strangely enough it has increasingly mastered
during at least two decades of doing the job.
	   And it should be pointed out that the debacle took place just in
the ``public'' portion of our higher education system. Admissions
to the ``private'' portion - which I must add has become rather big
in itself - are still left to each and every institution, without
much interference from the ministry.
	   The Minister of Education has also announced that the task of
channelling candidates who failed to get a place in the recently
completed admissions exercise to the private portion of the higher
education system had been ``privatised'', and has been awarded to
KUB.
	   At this stage of co-ordination, another type of confusion may
appear, that is disparities between the ``costs'' of public and
private higher education.
	   To clients who can afford private higher education, who
purposely choose private over public education because of its
``quality'' and its links to foreign (therefore purportedly higher)
standards, the disparities may not even be considered a problem.
	   But with the amount of money available to the middle classes to
throw around these days greatly reduced by the economic downturn
and with the myth of the ``superiority'' of foreign higher
education increasingly being questioned both on a theoretical level
and at the performance level in the classrooms of the private
colleges, the differences in costs could begin to appear much less
justifiable.
	   To those students who would be channelled into the private
institutions because they could not be placed in the public higher
education sector, the disparities in costs would certainly
constitute a burden.
	   Murmurs of protests are already heard, and Mara, among others,
has already announced plans and additional allocations to help such
students meet their financial obligations.
	   The way that we have incorporated universities from other
English- speaking countries of the world almost as an integral part
of our own higher education system must have made us pioneers of
sorts in the consumption of ``global education''.
	   As demands for such global education continued to increase,
backed by money made available by a robust economy, entrepreneurs
as usual were quick to act to seize the opportunity to establish
private colleges that would make such education locally available
through a gamut of twinning and franchising arrangements.
	   Today no less than 50 such ``colleges'' are in operation in this
country - some large and impressive and backed by big capital,
while others are more sekolah malam-like operations owned by
smaller entrepreneurs but backed by strong political connections -
offering a variety of degree programmes (no less than 200 in
number) in conjunction with foreign universities, ranging from
prestigious ones like London University to an unknown community
college in some small town in Iowa.
	   Burdened by the pressure of having to generate income under the
privatisation and corporatisation policies of the Government, the
local public universities too began to be involved in
``franchising'' their courses - more exactly in peddling their
``charter'' to award degrees - to similar private colleges.
	   Initially it was mainly matriculation programmes that were
franchised but these days even diploma and degree programmes are
being peddled in the education franchising marketplace.
	   It is claimed that some local universities have even franchised
programmes that they do not offer themselves at their own campuses.
That would be something akin to Macdonald's offering franchising
for pesembor penang and yong tow foo to some local food stalls.
	   All these unorthodox methods of peddling educational programmes
raise a number of disquieting questions concerning standards - not
only questions concerning the franchisees' ability to attain
standards set by the franchisers, whose standards are themselves
being questioned, but also questions of whether the franchisees are
really getting the products that they are paying for and whether
they themselves are really competent to resell the products.
	   One interesting observation that can be made concerning all
these ``educational'' developments is the predominance of purely
business consideration - as opposed to some measure of social,
intellectual and pedagogical considerations - in spurring them
along.
	   A highly prestigious foreign university has opened a branch
campus in this country in co-operation with some local
entrepreneurial interests.
	   A local corporate group appears to be earnestly confident of its
ability to replicate the educational and intellectual ambience of
MIT of Boston in this country by simply pouring lots of money into
establishing a college and by bringing over some of the institute's
professors here for a short stay.
	   Even the Government's stated desire to turn the country into a
regional educational centre of excellence has been expressed mainly
in business terms - to attract students from other countries in the
region, and from outside the region too, to study here, pay their
fees to our colleges in foreign currencies, and thereby help to
develop our higher education infrastructure and our economy.
	   The development of our higher education system which has become
unnecessarily complex and unwieldy during the last few years has
been basically spurred by the same profit motivation that
encouraged housing and building developers to over-build, and
thereby causing a glut in the property market.
	   As the property market has often been used as an indicator of
the state of our ``bubble'' economy before it burst under the
impact of a global capital and financial market crisis earlier this
year, it is therefore quite proper to consider the question: Did we
also have an education bubble?
	   Now that there is an marked increase in demands for ``public''
higher education and a widespread notion that the ``over-built''
private higher educational facilities do not actually produce the
higher standards that they promised and that have become expected
of them - and cost-wise they are generally becoming out-of-reach to
the ordinary clients - one is also tempted to ask: Is the education
bubble too about to burst?

	   KOTA BARU, Thurs. - Kelantan and Perak will join hands to curb
smuggling and illegal transportation of undersized cockles.
	   Kelantan Fisheries Department director Sani Mohd Isa said the
Perak Fisheries Department had given its assurance to co-operate
with Kelantan.
	   He said the Perak Fisheries Department would intensify checks
against vehicles, especially lorries, leaving the State.
	   ``It is found that those involved in the smuggling and illegal
transportation of the undersized cockles are lorry drivers,'' he
said, adding that the cockles were brought to Kelantan before being
smuggled into the neighbouring country.
	   He said four cases were reported over the past three days and
six people, four of them lorry drivers, were arrested in Jeli,
Rantau Panjang and Tanah Merah during routine checks.Also 635 gunny
sacks of undersized cockles were seized.
	   The men, in their 30s, were released on police bail after paying
a compound of RM500 each.

	   JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - Thirty-three companies have closed down in
Johor in the past year causing 4,000 workers to lose their jobs,
Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said today.
	   Speaking after launching Epson Precision (Johor) Sdn Bhd's 10th
anniversary celebrations, he said it was not known whether the
4,000 had found new jobs.
	   However, he said, the economic downturn had created the
opportunity for workers to enhance their skills or acquire new ones
to facilitate labour mobility.
	   Meanwhile, Ghani said European companies, including from
Finland, had expressed interest to source components from local
vendors.
	   ``They feel components produced by our small- and medium-sized
industries are now cheaper.
	   ``Our SMIs have the opportunity to play a greater role as
suppliers of engineering and other parts,'' he added.

	   KUALA NERANG, Thurs. - The Education Ministry will review the
current schooling system to encourage the development of fast
learners and students who excel in sports.
	   Deputy Education Minister Datuk Dr Fong Chan Onn said the
Ministry would pay particular attention to the learning process and
examination system in schools, beginning with Smart Schools.
	   ``We are looking at changes to the system to ensure learning is
more interesting and students are encouraged to pursue their own
areas of interest.
	   ``Students who are mathematically, musically or
language-inclined should be given the opportunity to develop their
skills and talents,'' he said when asked to comment on letters
published in the New Straits Times recently.
	   The writers claimed that the issue of fast learners in school
was being mishandled by the Ministry.
	   He said there was some flexibility in Government primary schools
where fast learners and other talented students were allowed to
complete their education earlier than the usual six-years.
	   ``However, now through the Smart schools, we are trying to make
secondary schools a little more flexible to the needs of
exceptional students,'' he said.
	   Asked what was being done to assist students who were forced to
drop out in order to undergo specialised sports training overseas,
Fong said the Ministry would look into the matter.
	   ``Right now our normal schooling system does not allow it, but
we will ask the Sports Division of the Ministry to see how we can
cater to these students.''
	   Earlier, during his visit to the Sekolah Rendah (C) Kuo Hua,
Fong said an abbatoir situated near the school would be relocated
to an alternative site.

U.N. gets new home for human rights named for late U.S. president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations formally took possession Friday
of the world's new ``home for human rights'' in a building named
for U.N. ``grandfather'' U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.
	   In handing over the Palais (pron. Pal'-ay) Wilson, Swiss
President Flavio Cotti quoted Wilson as stressing more than 80
years ago: ``The world can only be at peace if human life is
anchored to a solid foundation.''
	   That foundation requires ``a sense of justice, freedom and
law,'' he added.
	   The 19th-century building on the shores of Lake Geneva served as
the original headquarters of the League of Nations, which was
proposed by Wilson in his famous 1918 speech of Fourteen Points on
how to restructure Europe to preserve the peace after World War I.
	   The league took up quarters in the former hotel in 1920. The
building was given Wilson's name when he died in 1924.
	   The league stayed in the building until 1936, when it moved into
the newly built and much larger quarters nearby that now house the
European headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Wilson's dream of United States membership in the league was
never realized because of opposition from a Republican-controlled
Senate, but his idea of a world body became the foundation of the
United Nations itself when it was formed after World War II.
	   The horrors of the Holocaust in that war fueled efforts to
concentrate on protecting the individual that led to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations 50 years
ago.
	   ``The greatest threat to peace and security anywhere is lack of
regard for human dignity,'' said Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace
prize-winning opposition leader in Myanmar, formerly called Burma,
in a message for the ceremony.
	   ``It is from this basic lack that injustice and cruelty,
extremism and violence erupt,'' she said.
	   Cotti said he was convinced that giving a special headquarters
to U.N. the s will help make the next 100 years ``the century of
human rights.''
	   At the moment only lip service is paid to human rights in many
nations, he said.
	   ``Last year torture was used in over 120 countries,'' Cotti
said. ``Arbitrary executions were reported in nearly 70
countries.''
	   The Swiss government spent over 73 million Swiss francs (dlrs 49
million) to renovate the building, which will be made available to
the United Nations free of charge.
	   Robinson will start moving into the Palais Wilson in September,
officials said.
	   Renovation of the Palais Wilson began in 1994, when it was
expected to house several environmental organizations from around
the globe, but other countries lured away those organization.

Kosovo Albanians talk of 50 deaths, destroyed villages
</HEADLINE>
  Ed: UPDATES with Serb police statement indicating end of offensive;
comments by British prime minister; another reported death;
Austrian foreign minister's comments; trims.
  By ISMET HAJDARI  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The latest Serbian offensive in
independence-minded Kosovo province produced reports on Friday of
50 dead, 200 missing, villages destroyed and a mass grave
containing 300 bodies.
	   A statement by Serb police issued late Friday indicated the
offensive had ended, with the ``terrorist gangs'' who tried to
block the key north-south Pec-Decani-Djakovica road being
``destroyed.'' Conditions had been fulfilled for civilians to
return, it said.
	   But traumatized ethnic Albanians continued to flee. Hundreds
more joined the thousands who have already escaped the fighting in
the week since the offensive began, with most of them heading for
neighboring Albania.
	   Some of them didn't make it.
	   In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency said some of the
400 or so who trekked into neighboring Albania overnight had
reported five deaths en route _ two elderly people, said to have
died of exhaustion, and three small children.
	   About 10,000 refugees are now gathered around Tropoja in
northern Albania, produced by the largest exodus since ethnic
tensions erupted into large-scale violence in March. Thousands more
are in neighboring Montenegro, which with Serbia, forms present-day
Yugoslavia.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the European Union will
get involved in the Kosovo crisis, but offered no details while
stopping in Rome, and Vienna, Austria.
	   Austria's foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel, said that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had promised him that
humanitarian organizations would have access to sealed off regions
of Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, who is thought to be behind the Serb crackdown in
Kosovo, also told Schuessel that refugees would be allowed to
return under U.N. control. But with similar promises made and often
broken in the Bosnian war, the fate of refugees remained unclear.
	   Reports from Serb and Albanian sources were often conflicting
and proved impossible to verify. Still, together, they reflected
the intensity of the conflict as Serbian government forces tried by
force to destroy the Kosovo Albanian drive to secede.
	   The Serb police statement said there were no civilian casualties
in the fighting. It spoke of no Albanian dead or injured, but said
two policemen were killed and five wounded.
	   But Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic League of Kosovo,
the ethnic Albanians' main party, listed more than 50 dead and some
200 missing from the latest offensive, concentrated around Decani,
some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Four villages populated by ethnic Albanians were destroyed,
another eight badly damaged, and 16 others deserted by fleeing
residents, Cacaj added.
	   The Beta news in Belgrade quoted unnamed refugees from Decani,
as saying a mass grave on the outskirts of the Serb-besieged town
contained 300 bodies. There were no details.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leaders in
the province, said one Albanian was killed and two wounded in
fighting around Orahovac, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
of Pristina. The pro-Serb Media Center spoke of an attack on a
police station in the same region that sent police retreating.
	   In separate reports, it said an Albanian woman was wounded
Friday, when an armed Albanian shot at a bus on the road running
between Pec, in the west, and Kosovska Mitrovica in the northeast,
and a Serb villager was killed by a masked gunman in the central
Drenica region.
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and demand independence from Serbia and the Yugoslav federation it
forms with tiny Montenegro.
	   Accounts are impossible to verify independently, as both Serbian
police forces and gunmen from the Kosovo Liberation Army _ fighting
for independence _ block adequate access to journalists and even
humanitarian workers. Pristina-based human rights groups on Friday
warned that food and medicines in some blocked off areas was
extremely short and asked for international aid.
	   Cacaj described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with some 45 bodies left unburied, farm animals roaming wild and
several thousand civilians hiding in the woods, trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania or to Montenegro, which with
Serbia, forms Yugoslavia.
	   There were conflicting reports of Serb casualties, with Cacaj
saying three policemen trying to loot a house had been shot dead by
its Albanian owner, and the Serb Media Center denying any officers
were killed or wounded.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which
Albanian political leaders say acts independently from them.

	   I WAS overjoyed when my daughter was accepted to do her
matriculation at University Malaya despite the earlier dukacita
dimaklumkan permohonan anda tidak berjaya from the UPU Infoline.
	   I was confident that she would be admitted to the main campus of
this premier university as there was nothing mentioned about UM's
franchise with private colleges at the time of application.
	   However it was not to be. Upon checking with UM, my daughter was
told that she had been placed at Inpens Kuala Selangor. She was to
wait for the letter from Inpens for details regarding registration,
tuition and other fees. No such letter ever came.
	   Instead, three days before the registration date, a call came
from Inpens stating that due to time constraints, no letter would
be sent. Just report for registration and the tuition and other
fees will be made known during registration, the caller said.
	   The real shock for the parents came when we were given the list
of fees to be paid, which came up to RM8,500 for two semesters.
	   I wish our Minister of Education and his Ministry officials were
present to witness the shocked faces of the parents there.
	   However, I must express my appreciation for the understanding
and sympathy shown by Inpens officials towards the predicament of
these shocked parents by allowing us to pay whatever amount we
could afford on that day. The balance could be paid in instalments.
	   I later learned that the parents of students placed at IKIP in
Kuantan had a bigger shock when told the total fees was a whopping
RM11,000 plus.
	   However, parents of students placed at the Mara College in
Banting were relieved when they only had to pay RM450, with the
rest borne by Mara.
	   These high and different charges by different colleges are
baffling and raise a number of questions which I would like to pose
to our beloved the Minister of Education: Is higher education
becoming the exclusive domain of the children of the rich and
famous?
	   Why are students placed in the private colleges (not through
their own choice) burdened with much higher fees than those placed
in the UM campus itself? Is this in line with the concept of social
justice repeatedly expounded by our Deputy Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Anwar Ibrahim?
	   Why do the costs vary from one college to another? Why are they
not standardised? Why allow them to fix their own `price'?
	   It must be pointed out that the students apply for admission to
a public university which is more affordable, which in my case was
the UM, and not to the private colleges.
	   Their placement at these private colleges where UM has a
franchise programme is not out of their own choice. Thus it is
outrageously unfair to subject them to the higher fees charged by
the private colleges.
	   Even if students placed in these private colleges are provided
with study loans, it simply means that their loans would be larger
and require a longer repayment period, compared to those placed in
the main UM campus.
	   Is this fair?
	   The conflicting statements made by the relevant authorities,
particularly the Education and Entrepreneur Development Ministers,
regarding financial aid to affected students further add to the
confusion and uncertainty faced by the parents.
	   The Minister of Education was quoted as assuring students
allocated matriculation places at private colleges under the
universities' franchise programme, not to worry about the high
costs as Mara will provide sponsorship for them (NST, May 28).
	   But the Minister of Entrepreneur Development on the same day
came out with a statement that the additional money allocated to
the Education Fund will be used to give financial aid to
matriculation students sponsored by Mara. What about those students
not sponsored by Mara?
	   I hope the relevant Ministers will look into the plight of the
affected students and come out with clear, non-conflicting and just
solution once and for all and allow these students to concentrate
on their studies without worrying about finance.
	   I also hope the bungling and inefficiency at the UPU this year
will be a thing of the past the next time.

Thirty-six U.S. warplanes end mission in Gulf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Thirty-six U.S. warplanes sent to this
Gulf island during the recent Iraqi showdown have ended their
mission, the official Gulf News Agency reported Friday.
	   The warplanes _ 12 F-15 fighters, 18 F-16 fighters, two B-1
bombers and four KC135R refueling tankers _ arrived in Bahrain in
November.
	   They were deployed when it seemed likely that the United States
might have to strike Iraq to force it to comply with U.N. Security
Council resolutions which say U.N. inspectors must have access to
suspected weapons sites.
	   The threat of an attack receded in February when Iraq agreed to
grant full access on condition that the inspectors be accompanied
by diplomats in their visits to presidential compounds.
	   The news agency gave no date for the departure of the aircraft,
but said Bahrain's Sheik Isa Air Base held a farewell reception for
the U.S. personnel on Friday.
	   The planes have spent the past seven months enforcing the no-fly
zone over southern Iraq and taking part in maneuvers.
	   Bahrain, a close ally of the United States, hosts the
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet.
	   The planes' departure is in line with President Bill Clinton's
decision in May to cut back on U.S. forces in the Gulf region.

	   KILLINGHALL (M) Bhd expects Southern Bank of Africa Ltd, which
began operations in February this year, to contribute positively to
the group's earnings in three to five years.
	   The bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Bank of Africa
Investment Holdings Ltd, in which Killinghall has a 50 per cent
stake.
	   Killinghall chairman Datuk Dr Salim Cassim said the company is
confident the bank will be a substantial contributor to the group
earnings despite competition from other banks in Johannesburg,
South Africa.
	   Speaking to reporters after the company's annual meeting in
Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, Dr Salim said: ``We expect it to be
tough initially as we will be competing against major banks in the
country.
	   ``However, we are confident that in the next three to five
years, we will see positive results.''
	   Early last year Killinghall bought a 50 per cent stake in SBAIH
comprising 50 million shares of Rand 1.00 each for a cash
consideration of Rand 50 million (about RM30 million).
	   Killinghall set up the bank jointly with National Empowerment
Trust Investment Fund Pty Ltd of South Africa with an initial
capital of RM150 million held in equal proportions by both parties.
	   A major facet of the bank's business is assisting the flow and
funding of direct and indirect Asean and Asian investments into
South Africa.
	   The bank is also expected to participate in housing programmes
promoted by the South African government.
	   During the year, Killinghall increased its interest in Southern
Bank Bhd, an associate company, from 25.80 per cent to 26.27 per
cent through its acquisition in the open market.
	   Director Datuk Tan Teong Hean said the company is considering
increasing its stake in Southern Bank in the near future.
	   Elaborating on other future plans, Tan said the board of
directors is exploring ways and means to weather the current
financial problem.
	   ``We are thinking of ways and means to reduce borrowings as
increased borrowings will subsequently reduce the group earnings.
	   ``Considering the current economic climate, we do not have any
major plans but we are looking for investment opportunities.''
	   Killinghall's group pre-tax profit for the year ended Dec 31,
1997, was RM25.07 million, a decline of 39 per cent from the
previous corresponding period.
	   This was attributed to the decrease in profit of the associated
company, Southern Bank and higher financial charges incurred in
financing further investment in the bank.
	   For the period reviewed, pre-tax profit of Southern Bank
declined by 29.7 per cent to RM12.2 million from RM173.7 million
previously due mainly to changes in loan classification, increased
provision for doubtful debts and provision for diminution in value
of assets.

	   SHANTI Aman alleged (NST, May 6), that (among many others) I am
being ``harsh'' and ``personal'' in my article about Kofi Annan and
the Nobel Peace Prize (NST, April 15).
	   But the harsh, sarcastic and uncouth tone and unfounded
allegations against me in her personal attacks can only be
described as ``shooting from the hip.''
	   Indeed, one particular point she made is nonsense, if not total
rubbish.
	   She mentioned that by ``Myint Zan's logic, Pol Pot could be
nominated for the Nobel Peace prize.''
	   Pray, from which particular paragraph, phrase, sentence or word
in my article can this ``logic'' be gleaned from?
	   That statement is all the more illogical, irresponsible,
preposterous and inane since I have written, on three separate
occasions, in the NST alone, the legal and moral necessity of
either getting recognition from the International Court of Justice
that Cambodians were the subject of genocide during the Democratic
Kampuchea era or that Pol Pot should be put before a special
international tribunal to be established by the United Nations.
	   (See my articles in NST of Nov 30, 1991, Sept 4, 1993 and July
26, 1996.) See also my article ``Some International Law Issues and
Lessons from the Cambodian Past'' in The Malayan Law Journal (May
8, 1992).
	   One does not wish to ``parade'' one's writings like this.
However, since Shanti Aman has made an allegation, at least by
inference, that I am ``pro- Pol Pot'' (as well as ``pro-Phoolan
Devi'' and again with absolutely no evidence or buttressing
points), I have mentioned them to illustrate the point that, among
the two of us, if anybody can take the moral high-ground against
Pol Pot, it is I who can do so and not Shanti Aman.
	   Incidentally, Shanti Aman is technically not correct in stating
that ``the whole world'' was ``united'' against Pol Pot and his
regime - at least as it relates to the events of the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
	   As pointed out in my article in the MLJ, from 1979 to 1981 the
majority (about two-thirds) of the world's nations, including the
United States, China and all Asean countries recognised Pol Pot's
odious regime as ``the legitimate Government'' of Cambodia
notwithstanding that, even during that time, it controlled less
than 10 per cent of Cambodian territory and notwithstanding the
Khmer Rouge's role in causing the deaths of at least a million
Cambodians during their rule.
	   Also, contrary to what Shanti Aman asserts, my ``crusade''
against Annan is not ``personal.''
	   As amply made clear in my article, it was based on the previous
line of thinking by the Nobel Peace Committee in declining to give
the 1965 award to U Thant.
	   (For a gracious narration about the circumstances pertaining to
the award of the 1965 Nobel Peace Prize by U Thant himself, see his
View From the UN, Doubleday, 1978).
	   In short, I had submitted that what was applicable to U Thant as
a serving Secretary-General should apply to Annan, as a current and
serving UN Secretary-General as well.
	   To make it clear that I am not being personal, I even used the
words ``he or she'' when stating that ``no serving UN
Secretary-General should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.''
	   It was not I who was ``personal'' and ``harsh'' in my article.
	   It was Shanti Aman who was sarcastic, personal, crude and
vindictive in her letter and in some of her groundless remarks and
shameful distortions of what I had actually written in my article.

	   I CAN'T help wonder why we Malaysians with our rich heritage of
proven traditional medicines and herbs still await the coming of
Viagra to our shores.
	   And especially with only a 70 per cent success rate and
estimated price US$28 (RM106) per pill, isn't it just too costly
when compared to our local jamu?
	   Our local mixture of honey, ginger and telur ayam kampung, with
a regular intake of vitamin E, should do wonders and save money.
	   Come on, you Malaysians, wake up! We have the cure here, our
very own proven traditional method instead of expensive imports.
	   For the past four years I've been treating a number of males
with sexual dysfunctions and various degrees of impotence with more
than a 90 per cent success rate.
	   Another dukun I know has an almost perfect success rate. He is
better than I am since not only can he cure impotence, he can also
make the manhood bigger and get it to last longer.
	   Why are we Malaysians looking to the West for a cure for
impotence while in Malaysia we have all the expertise? Just put
your trust in our traditional healers.
	   I am issuing an open challenge and am prepared to take on any
Western specialists head-on with five patients each (no diabetics
please) free of charge to test who can produce the best results in
a week.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Singaporeans with outstanding traffic
summonses may be detained when they are returning to the republic.
	   This is among the proposals being considered by the police and
the Road Transport Department to recover RM2 million in traffic
fines owed by Singaporeans, Parliamentary Secretary to the
Transport Ministry Datuk Chor Chee Heung said.
	   Another proposal is to blacklist such vehicles and bar them from
entering the country, he added.
	   ``The drivers and passengers of the vehicles can be detained
until they settle the summonses.
	   ``The Johor Immigration Department will be asked to assist the
police and the RTD.''
	   Chor was speaking after receiving Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department's International Criminal Investigation Division chief
Inspector Eiji Miyamoto at Wisma MCA in Jalan Ampang.
	   Miyamoto, who is on a private visit to the country, paid a
courtesy call on Chor who is also head of the MCA's International
Affairs Bureau.
	   ``The ministry has also received many complaints from the public
on the discourteous attitude of the republic's drivers on Malaysian
roads,'' Chor said.
	   The New Straits Times reported on May 24 that 36,941 traffic
summonses were issued to Singaporean drivers last year.
	   Of this number, only 9,258, or about 25 per cent, have paid the
compound fines. Since 1994, more than RM2 million in compound fines
involving errant Singaporean motorists had not been settled.
	   Johor police recently launched an operation at the Causeway and
Second Link to trace the offenders. Within four hours, police had
traced 20 offenders and collected RM2,000 in fines.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Tin Market closed 38 sen higher at RM23.01 per
kg yesterday, extending Wednesday's gains due to the substantial
increase on the London Metal Exchange overnight.
	   Three-month tin on the LME surged US$140 and this spurred buying
interest for local tin.
	   At the opening level of RM23.01, bids were 189 tonnes compared
to offers of 95 tonnes.
	   Turnover at the close widened to 106 tonnes with European and
local buyers taking the bulk of the transactions.

Salvador government blocks sister city effort
</HEADLINE>
  By EDITH BELTRAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A plan to make sister cities of
the Cuban and Salvadoran capitals has turned into more of a family
feud.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol announced Thursday that his
government would not allow a visit by Havana Mayor Conrado
Martinez, who was invited by San Salvador Mayor Hector Silva as
part of a sister city project.
	   Calderon Sol's party supported a war against pro-Cuban leftist
rebels in the 1980s. Silva was elected in a coalition that includes
those former leftists, now a political party.
	   ``We are brothers of the Cuban people, but what impedes foreign
relations is the line of the government'' of Cuba's President Fidel
Castro, Calderon Sol said in remarks published by newspapers here
Friday.
	   The hard-line Interior Minister, Mario Acosta, was even more
blunt earlier: ``No Cuban enters.''
	   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the central
government _ not the city's _ was responsible for foreign affairs
and noting the El Salvador has ``asked the Cuban government to make
advances toward democracy.''
	   ``We want to see a democratic government, not political
prisoners,'' it said.
	   That left former rebel commander Facundo Guardado, now a member
of San Salvador's city council, sputtering Friday.
	   The government behavior was outrageous, he said. ``They know
that large Salvadoran investors are operating in Cuba. The position
they are adopting now is absurd.''
	   City spokesman Juan Jose Dalton said the sister city agreement
would go forward _ but would be signed in Havana instead. He
insisted the pact is not diplomatic, merely cultural and social.

	   THE Malaysian rubber market drifted further to close easier
yesterday, on lack of interest coupled with lacklustre trading on
other regional markets.
	   ``The Indonesian rubber market was still very quiet on worries
of its social condition and we do not expect the local market to
improve as well,'' said a local dealer.
	   Players shied away from the market despite the lower rubber
prices offered, he added.
	   July RSS-One eased one sen to 288 sen per kg while SMR-20 erased
3.5 sen to 275.50 sen.

Incendiary bomb explodes in television channel building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A firebomb exploded Friday in a building
housing offices of a television channel in Athens, leading to a
fire which caused slight damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The makeshift bomb consisting of propane gas canisters exploded
at around 9:40 pm (1840 GMT) on the eighth floor of the New Channel
building, outside the offices of the channel's accounting
department and journalism school.
	   An anonymous caller telephoned the Athens daily Eleftherotypia
shortly before the blast, saying only ``New Channel will burn
tonight,'' authorities said. The caller claimed to represent a
shadowy group called ``Left-wing Cells.''
	   Similar firebombs have been used since late last year to torch
more than 150 offices and cars, mostly in Athens, since January.
They belonged to officials, politicians, Jewish and anti-Semitic
groups, diplomats, journalists and foreigners.
	   Most attacks have been claimed by shadowy groups little-known to
authorities.

	   CRUDE palm oil futures on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange
(KLCE) finished higher yesterday on lower stock figures and talk
that India will issue new tenders soon, dealers said.
	   One dealer said players were bullish on a report saying that the
US agricultural attache estimated that Malaysia's palm oil stocks
for end- June would ease to 525,000 tonnes from 290,000 tonnes at
the same month last year.
	   Talks that the State Trading Corporation of India will issue a
new tender soon spurred interest further for local palm oil, he
said.
	   At the KLCE's close, spot month June was RM10 higher to RM2,355
per tonne, July surged RM20 to RM2,332 while August rose RM21 to

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with Holyfield comments; Will be UPDATED after news
conference, scheduled for 2000 GMT.  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield never really wanted to fight
Henry Akinwande. Now he won't have to.
	   The heavyweight title fight was called off Friday, a day before
the bout, because Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B.
	   ``I guess I'm the guy things happen to,'' said Holyfield, who
was informed the fight was off when he arrived at Madison Square
Garden for his final pre-fight workout. Holyfield went back to his
hotel, saying he was still hopeful a last-minute opponent could be
found for him.
	   ``Seems kind of strange to wait to the last minute,'' Holyfield
said. ``But I'm already in shape. If you don't fight, you don't get
paid either.''
	   Promoters scheduled a Friday afternoon news conference to
discuss whether the card will go forward at all. Ticket sales had
been poor, with promoters saying only 6,000 tickets had been
distributed in the days before the fight.
	   Earlier, heavyweight Ray Mercer also was scratched from the card
for undisclosed medical reasons and Christy Martin's opponent
couldn't fight because she's pregnant. That left the aging Roberto
Duran as the lone remaining attraction.
	   Two separate medical tests on Akinwande by the New York State
Athletic Commission showed he had hepatitis B, said Greg Fritz, a
spokesman for Don King Productions, the promoter of the fight.
	   The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
	   ``It's disappointing,'' said Holyfield, who had made no secret
of his lack of desire to fight the WBA's No. 1 contender. ``You
prepare yourself for 13 weeks and then this happens.''
	   Hepatitis B, often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic
needles, can cause serious liver problems. The disease can be
treated successfully, but not always. Hepatitis A is typically a
food-borne disease that can pass quickly.
	   The Showtime network, which was to televise the bout from
Madison Square Garden, also said in a statement that the main event
had been canceled due to the commission's medical finding.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included the
46-year-old Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971 and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   On Thursday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because she
was pregnant. Melissa Salamore was to have replaced Garcia, but
Martin rejected her as an opponent, and promoters were trying to
find another fighter.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to his once promising
career. He was disqualified in the fifth round of a fight last July
against WBC champ Lennox Lewis for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was even supposed to fight for a piece of the
title for the second time in less than a year was due more to his
choice of promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle,
King matched him against Orlin Norris Jr., and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Akinwande was to make dlrs 2.5 million to fight Holyfield, who
was to get dlrs 10 million for the defense of the WBA title he won
in his first fight with Mike Tyson.
	   Holyfield had wanted to fight Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title. He was
openly unenthusiastic about fighting Akinwande, who is 33-1-1, and
almost nobody but Akinwande and the WBA wanted it.

	   I WAS shocked to read that former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Muhammad Muhammad Taib had said in a Brisbane Court during his
trial that it was common for Malaysians travelling overseas to
carry a lot of cash.
	   How could he make a general statement like this?
	   It is a different story if he and his colleagues carry huge
amounts of money when they travel overseas but not the average
Malaysian. An average middle-income Malaysian does not carry even
RM100,000 in cash. The question of RM1 million is certainly out.
	   The majority of the middle-income Malaysians carry credit cards
and/or travellers' cheques and not such big sums in cash!
Muhammad's statement which appeared in newspapers worldwide will
put many Malaysians travelling overseas on the alert-list of
immigration and Customs officers of other countries.
	   I believe Muhammad made this statement for his own defence under
instruction from his lawyers but I think he should have been more
careful in his choice of words.

	   HONG Kong share prices dropped 2.9 per cent yesterday to a near
five-month low on a weaker US market despite easier domestic
interbank rates, dealers said.
	   ``The fall is mainly due to the overnight drop on Wall Street,''
amid fears of a sharp correction in the US market and its potential
effect on global markets, said Michael Ng, associate director at
Sassoon Securities.
	   The key Hang Seng index lost 260.79 points to close at 8,558.43
- the lowest since it hit 8,578.98 on January 15.
	   The index gained 2.6 per cent in the previous day's trade.
	   The value of turnover amounted to HK$4.511 billion (RM2.2
billion) against the previous day's HK$5.724 billion.
	   Following overnight falls on Wall Street, the market opened
weakly with the key barometer losing 213.41 points by the end of
the morning session.

	   HEAVE HO ... These motorcyclists are seen frantically attempting
to drag their machines to higher ground after a downpour flooded
Jalan Silang in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The road was among several in the city centre which were flooded
following a two-hour long thunderstorm.
	   Flash floods were also reported in Jalan Stadium and several
areas in Petaling Jaya including Kampung Baru Subang and Jalan
Sungai Buloh.
	   A City traffic police spokesman said the downpour, which
occurred about 3pm, also uprooted several trees in Jalan Ampang and
Jalan Yap Kwan Seng which caused a massive traffic jam in the area.
	   The rain also caused a bumper-to-bumper crawl along the Federal
Highway.

	   TOKYO, Thurs: Malaysia will begin accepting yen loans again as
the Japanese currency has depreciated against the US dollar, Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.
	   He said while borrowing in the yen was once stopped because it
had appreciated and cost more to repay, now is a good time to
borrow yen since the currency has fallen to seven-year lows against
the greenback.
	   The yen was yesterday traded at 137.3 against the greenback.
	   Speaking to Malaysian journalists here last night, Dr Mahathir
said the Government is negotiating the rates for new yen loans.
	   ``These loans can be used for many things. There are project
financing and special loans for environmentally-friendly
projects,'' he added.
	   Only 15 per cent of Malaysia's external debt of RM166.29 billion
last year was in yen. The bulk, or 76 per cent of the total debt,
was in US dollar and the remaining 9 per cent in other currencies,
according to Bank Negara Malaysia's annual report for 1997.
	   Dr Mahathir is in Tokyo on a five-day working visit, during
which he addressed two international-level conferences of
economists.
	   At these forums, the Prime Minister renewed his call for reform
of the international financial system and for countries in which
currency traders operate to regulate their activities.
	   Asked about International Monetary Fund first deputy managing
director Stanley Fischer's response that Dr Mahathir's proposal for
bilateral balanced trade would slow progress and be a step back to
pre World War arrangements, the Prime Minister said: ``What's wrong
with going back to something that was good? I don't agree that we
shouldn't go back.
	   Sometimes we take the wrong turn and we have to go back. Even
the West has gone back many times.''
	   On whether the developed countries would support his proposal
for reform of the international financial system, he said, at the
moment the rich countries are doing well and do not see any need
for reform.
	   ``They are not losing any money. In fact they are making a lot
of money, so why should they reform? But one day they will lose
money. Then maybe they will ask for reform,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said the currency traders too will eventually
realise the mistake of attacking the currencies to the point of
driving whole countries towards bankruptcy.
	   ``I believe eventually they will destroy their market, and when
they destroy the market, they will not get anything out of the
market anymore.
	   At that stage, they will realise their mistake.
	   ``Yes, it will be too late but what is there we can do? They are
powerful and very big. We are small. So we need to think about how
we can probably get out of the system,'' he said.
	   Asked how he envisioned the world then under such hopeless
conditions, Dr Mahathir said: ``The world took 70 years to learn
that Communism doesn't work. During that period, millions of people
died. That's the price of making mistakes.
	   That is the price for not recognising something that is bad
early.
	   ``Maybe the world will go through the same cycle. That is why I
mentioned that although governments may comply and say, yes that is
good, the people may not say so,'' he added.
	   Dr Mahathir said the people might resent their own companies
being taken over by foreigners, and may act against the foreigners.
	   He said it will take a long time before Asia recovers from the
present economic turmoil, for some countries longer than others.
	   ``When it does recover, it will be quite a different kind of
situation. I don't believe we can just go back to square one.''
	   He said Malaysia, through the National Economic Action Council,
is studying the way other countries handle similar problems
including taking extraordinary measures.
	   ``People are learning to do things that may not be the standard
method but nevertheless they are willing and brave enough to do it,
and because of that they are safe.
	   ``We ourselves must begin to think that there is no orthodox way
of dealing with an unorthodox situation. We may have to think of
unorthodox ways of dealing with the situation.''

Soccer star Pele to hand over French Open trophy

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Taking avantage of the upcoming World Cup soccer
tournament in France, the French Tennis Federation has invited the
Brazilian sports minister, Edson Arantes do Nascimento _ Pele, for
short _ to hand out the Musketeers Cup to the men's singles
champion.
	   The triple World Cup winner for the Brazilian team in 1958, 1962
and 1970 will be joined in the ceremony by Donald Budge. Budge was
the first tennis player to win a Grand Slam 60 years ago in 1938.
	   The women's singles Suzanne Lengen Cup will be handed out
Saturday by Virginia Ruzici, who won the women's tournament in 1978
and by Ilie Nastase, who was the 1973 men's winner.
	     ---  
	     WORLD CUP FEVER:   With the beginning of the World Cup just days
away, the tennis crowd at Roland Garros is getting into the spirit
of things.
	   The Chilean fans were first in showing up in soccer jerseys to
support their compatriot, Marcelo Rios. Dutch, Italian and
Czechoslovakian fans also started wearing their teams' colors.
	   Some players are not indifferent to the World Cup. No. 10 men's
seed Richard Krajicek came on court for his third-round match
against Cedric Pioline in an official Dutch team jersey with his
name on the back.
	   Mario Zabaleta of Argentina put on his nation's jersey after his
first-round upset of No. 2 seed Petr Korda.
	   But there are players who perhaps take their love for soccer a
little bit too far.
	   France's Fabrice Santoro announced that he will not play
Wimbledon so he can stay in France and follow the World Cup.
	   But there are still some fans who prefer rackets over soccer
balls.
	   Brazilian tennis lover Paolo Coutinho came to Paris especially
for the French Open.
	   ``I hate soccer and the madness that takes over my country every
four years,'' he said. ``Still, I'm in France thanks to the cheap
airline tickets to Paris in the period of the World Cup. Soccer
helped my dream come true: to watch Guga (Gustavo Kuerten), (Jaime)
Oncins and (Fernando) Meligeni play at Roland Garros.''
	     ---  
	     VIVA ESPANA:   Thursday morning, before the gates to Roland
Garros were opened, some lucky spectators saw a display of Spanish
solidarity on center court.
	   To warm up for her semifinal match against Lindsay Davenport,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario found an exclusive sparring partner in
Carlos Moya, who'll be playing in the men's final on Sunday.
	   One of the spectators at the warmup match was top seed Martina
Hingis, who was Sanchez Vicario's most ardent supporter and
applauded every good shot she made against Moya.
	   All the support paid off as Sanchez Vicario beat Davenport in
straight sets to advance to the finals. Hingis, though, lost to
Monica Seles in the other women's semifinal.
	     ---  
	     GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES:   Felix Mantilla says he's sticking to
blond for Wimbledon. The Spanish men's semifinalist was asked if he
had a new color in mind for the next Grand Slam, but the answer was
no.
	   ``I think it will stay this color, because I lost today,'' he
said after his semifinal loss to Carlos Moya on Friday.
	   Mantilla dyed his hair blond on a bet with Argentinian player
Luis Lobo during the German Open in May.
	   ``I said that if I reach the semifinals, I must do it, I must
change my color,'' said Mantilla.
	   What do others think of the new hairdo?
	   ``Some people like it, some people don't like it. But it doesn't
matter because now I'm young, '' said Mantilla, whose hair is
naturally dark brown. ``I like to do some things differently.''

	   SEREMBAN, Thurs. - Concerned with the increasing number of
copper cable thefts in the State this year, police have vowed to
come down hard on scrap metal traders and dealers who have
transactions with the thieves.
	   Since January, police have received 55 reports on copper cable
thefts at various locations in the State.
	   In the latest incident yesterday, burglars escaped with copper
cables worth about RM60,000, following a break-in at an abandoned
factory in Senawang.
	   State Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant
Commissioner Kamarulzaman Itam today urged scrap metal dealers to
co-operate with the police when approached by those wanting to
dispose of copper cables.
	   ``As such items can be sold very cheap, we are seeking the
co-operation of the dealers to help us nab those who might be
linked with copper cable thieves,'' he added.
	   Those with information on copper cable thefts are urged to
contact him at 06-7622222.

	   KL AIRPORT Services Sdn Bhd (KLAS), a member of the DRB-Hicom
Group, yesterday secured its fifth customer when it signed a ground
handling agreement with Dubai-based Emirates.
	   With the agreement, the ground handling operator will provide
four main services to Emirates, including inflight catering
services, passenger services, aircraft handling and cargo handling
from its newly-completed facilities at KL International Airport
(KLIA) in Sepang.
	   DRB-Hicom Group senior group director Datuk Maznah Abdul Jalil
signed the agreement on behalf of KLAS while Emirates was
represented by its senior general manager (ground services), Mr
Mohammed H. Mattar.
	   Speaking to reporters after the signing ceremony, Maznah said
being a new ground handling operator in the country, KLAS has made
``good progress''
	   by securing five customers.
	   ``Of course, we will not stop at five. We have just completed
our facilities at KLIA and we are now only starting to market our
services. We have (set) our targets (of customers) and we are
slowly getting there,''she said.
	   Besides Emirates, KLAS is also the ground handling operator for
Kampuchea Airlines, Federal Express, Transmile and DRB-Hicom's
sister company, AirAsia.
	   Maznah said all facilities of KLAS are ready for operation on
the opening day of the airport at the end of this month.
	   ``The operation of KLAS has moved to KLIA since the middle of
last month.
	   Besides KLIA and the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International
Airport in Subang, we will also be operating in other airports
namely Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Johor Baru,'' she said.
	   KLAS is the one of the two ground handling operators in
Malaysia. The other is Malaysia Airlines.
	   KLAS chief executive officer Sharifah Halimah Syed Ahmad said
there will be a total of 49 foreign carriers operating at the new
airport.
	   ``Of this total, we would like to have as many of them as our
customers, but it will be tough because we are still new.
	   ``Nonetheless, the customers that we are currently serving have
expressed their satisfaction about our service. And we will
continue to deliver what we have promised,'' she said.
	   On its ground handling charges, she said ``they are value for
money''.
	   Sharifah Halimah also said at this point in time, it is not
possible for KLAS to handle all of the 49 carriers which are flying
into KLIA.
	   ``We are just a two-year-old company. There is a limited
capacity in dealing with cargo volume. Our maximum cargo capacity
at KLIA is about 150,000 tonnes per year whereas we can prepare up
to 7,500 inflight meals per day,'' she added.
	   Meanwhile, Mohammed said the reason why Emirates chose KLAS as
its ground handling operator at KLIA is that ``it shares our
objectives of providing only the best to customers.''
	   ``In addition, because KLAS is a young and dynamic company like
Emirates, we believe it can gives us the necessary service to serve
our passengers,''
	   he said.
	   Emirates now flies four times a week between Dubai and Kuala
Lumpur.
	   On AirAsia, Maznah said because the carrier is still small, it
is able to adjust itself during the current economic situation.
	   ``We are flexible enough to weave in and out in this current
economic conditions, and certainly we (AirAsia) are still here,''
she said. To date, AirAsia has two 737-300s.

	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup countdown underway in a country
crippled by labor disputes, defiant sports officials predicted
Friday that soccer would prevail.
	   After marathon overnight talks ended in stalemate, Air France
officials met with pilots for a fourth round of negotiations Friday
night to try and end the five-day strike.
	   Speaking before the session began at 9.15 p.m. (1915 GMT),
Christian Paris, a spokesman for the SNPL pilots' union, was less
optimistic, saying talks ``were at a standstill.''

Spaniard to get opener; Swiss to handle United States-Iran
</HEADLINE>
  With List  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jose Manuel Garcia Aranda of Spain, who officiated
the 1996 Olympic tournament in Atlanta, will referee the World Cup
opener between defending champion Brazil and Scotland, FIFA
announced Friday.
	   The 42-year-old Madrid physical education teacher has been a
referee since 1974 and an international field official since 1993.
He refereed the 1997 Toyota Cup final between Germany's Borussia
Dortmund and Brazil's Cruzeiro and also has overseen European
Champions League matches.
	   FIFA announced the referees for 34 of their early round matches,
with the remaining 14 games to be assigned referees by mid-June,
FIFA said. Each of the previously designated referees received one
match.
	   Swiss Urs Meier will get the politically charged match between
the United States and Iran on June 21 in Lyon. The 39-year-old with
21 years experience was the referee for last year's European
Champions Cup final between Dortmund and Manchester United.
	   The lowlands grudge match between longtime rivals Belgium and
the Netherlands at St. Denis on June 13 will be handled by
Pierluigi Collina, the internationally renown Italian who is easily
identifiable by his shaven scalp.
	   Collina handled the 1996 Olympic final between Nigeria and
Argentina as well as his regular Serie A duties.
	   The host's French's first game, against South Africa in
Marseille on June 12 was scheduled for Maurizo Rezende, a
37-year-old Brazilian who has officiated the Toyota Cup, Copa
Libertadores and South American SuperCup matches.

	   KL International Airport Bhd (KLIA Bhd) chairman Tan Sri
Clifford Herbert yesterday denied allegations that air freight
forwarders were forced into signing a bonded warehouse tenancy
agreement.
	   ``We never forced anybody. They all signed willingly. There was
100 per cent acceptance,'' Herbert said at the new airport
yesterday.
	   He had earlier accompanied Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling
Liong Sik, who toured the airport and checked on the preparation
for the opening of the airport by the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong on June
29.
	   Business Times understands that 27 tenants have so far taken up
warehouse space at KLIA.
	   The high rental rate at the airport's cargo village has been
on-going issue between the airport's cargo handling agents and the
air freighters.
	   The Airfreight Forwarders Association of Malaysia (AFAM) claimed
that their members were forced to sign the agreement after Malaysia
Airlines, one of the two ground handling agents, issued them the
ultimatum early this week.
	   The other ground handling agent is Kuala Lumpur Airport Services
Sdn Bhd (KLAS).
	   Malaysia Airlines is expected to offer 68 bonded warehouses
while KLAS is expected to offer another 27.
	   AFAM members claimed they were told to sign the agreement or
risk losing their warehouse space at the airport.
	   The association complained, among other things, of the high
rental tariff at KLIA, which is said to be much higher than many
other countries, and the inadequate warehouse space which is not up
to international standards.
	   The rental at KLIA has been proposed at RM5 per sq ft, plus a
service charge of 25 sen.
	   The rate at Singapore airport is RM2.78 per sq ft, Frankfurt
(RM1.67 per sq ft) and New York (RM1.88 per sq ft).
	   Dr Ling, meanwhile, said he was informed that the rate charged
at KLIA is the same as those currently being charged at the Sultan
Abdul Aziz Shah airport in Subang.
	   ``It is the same charge. The rate for the facilities at Subang
is also RM5.50, so there's no change. Furthermore all the warehouse
space has been taken up and paid for already,'' he said.
	   Asked if the air freight forwarders have no basis for
complaining about high tariff, he said: ``Any airport operators
should not outprice themselves and in the process, turn people
away. They have to be competitive.''
	   Malaysia Airports Bhd officials, meanwhile, declined to be
dragged into the fracas.
	   ``No comment. We are not getting involved in the issue. This is
something to be sorted out between the tenant and landlord,'' one
official told Business Times.
	   AFAM president Walter Culas, when contacted by Business Times,
said the association will request Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim to intervene personally on their behalf.
	   ``We have given KLIA Bhd two weeks to respond to our memorandum,
but they (KLIA Bhd) have still not come back to us. The industry
and our members need an answer from them. We have been waiting to
hear from them. We cannot be kept in the dark,'' he said.
	   Culas added that the air freighters need to advise their agents
all over the world to update their addresses and also to ensure a
smooth transition from one airport to the other.
	   ``We need to maintain split operations for about one month.
Unlike passenger handling, cargo handling operations cannot be
moved all at once.''
	   Dr Ling earlier had a look at, and was briefed on, the site for
the airport opening on June 29.

	   THE KL International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang is 99 per cent
complete and ``ready to go'', Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling
Liong Sik said yesterday.
	   ``Malaysia Airports Bhd is here already, and they are working
three shifts to run things smoothly,'' he said.
	   Trial tests using real passengers, aircraft and luggage are also
on- going.
	   Dr Ling said he is confident that the airport's operations and
systems will run well.
	   He was at the airport yesterday to inspect the piazza at the
airport, the site for the opening ceremony of the airport by the
Yang Di Pertuan Agong on June 29.
	   Following the opening ceremony, a convoy of 441 heavy vehicles
and 1,000 cars will take part in a huge shift from Subang to
Sepang.
	   Meanwhile, Dr Ling said the public has a wide choice in the
various modes of transport to get to the airport. ``They should not
just look at the most expensive mode of transport which is the
premier limousine, and focus on that only,'' he said.
	   Two days ago, the Cabinet approved the public transportation
fares to the airport from the city centre. They range from RM6.50
for a combination of KTM Komuter and stage buses to RM88 for a
premier taxi. These are one- way fares.
	   Other modes of transport include stage buses, semi-luxury bus
service, luxury bus service, budget taxi and Klang Valley taxi.

	   PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - The Fisheries Department is drawing up a
set of legislations for State Governments to adopt to conserve and
protect endangered turtles and terrapins.
	   The legislations which can help resolve the problem of
fragmented and inadequate laws in the country will, among others,
ban the consumption and collection of turtles, turtle eggs and
terrapins in all States.
	   Head of marine parks section Kevin W.P. Hiew said today the
department was working with non-governmental organisations,
particularly the Worldwide Fund for Nature Malaysia, on the
legislations.
	   The legislations are being drawn under the Fisheries Act 1985
which empowers State authorities to enact their own regulations to
conserve and protect turtles and turtle eggs.
	   The idea is to draft a model set of legislations for States to
adopt in total or partially. If adopted in total, State authorities
will have to repeal their existing laws. Otherwise, they can refer
to the draft to improve their own laws.
	   ``The existing laws are not adequate. Some do not offer
protection for turtles, but emphasises on collection of turtle
eggs.
	   ``Some of the laws are also fragmented and different States have
different laws. Our objective is to standardise the laws for more
effective enforcement,'' Hiew said at the launch of WWF's Handbook
on Integrated Coastal and Estuarine Zone Management.
	   Conservationists and environmentalists have long expressed
concern over the lack of protection for turtles.
	   To date, only four States - Terengganu, Pahang, Sabah and
Sarawak - have legislations on turtles. But they were inadequate.
And only Terengganu bans collection of turtle eggs.
	   The State's laws only protect leatherback turtles although other
species such as hawksbill and olive ridley are also under threat.
	   Federal legislations are also not much help. The Fisheries Act
offers no clear definition of turtles while the Wildlife Protection
Act 1972 does not provide protection to turtles.
	   The Fisheries Department and WWF hope to overcome these problems
with the model legislations.
	   However, Hiew said the acceptance of the legislations was still
the States' prerogative.
	   WWF's Wildlife Ecologist and senior scientific officer Dr
Dionysius S.K.
	   Sharma said the new legislations would encompass all aspects of
conservation for the different species of turtles and habitat
protection.
	   They will also provide for the incubation of turtle eggs in
hatcheries.
	   Work on the legislations began early this year and is expected
to be completed by end of the year.
	   Dionysius said the draft would be completed in about two months,
after which it would be circulated to scientists and State
authorities for feedback.
	   Hiew said the main threat to turtles were egg collection and
consumption.
	   ``Since this is a 100-year tradition, we are willing to allow
the villagers to collect the eggs and sell them to us for hatching
purposes.
	   ``However, villagers prefer to sell the eggs to the public as
they can fetch better prices,'' he said.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Substitute striker David Trezeguet beat
an offside trap and scored with seven minutes remaining to give
France a 1-0 victory over Finland Friday night in its final prep
match before the start of the World Cup.
	   Didier Deschamps' pass from midfield found Trezeguet alone on
the left flank, where he dribbled in and fired high over Finnish
keeper Antti Niemi from about 8 meters.
	   Finnish defenders raised their hands to signal that Zinedine
Zidane was offside, but the linesman apparently felt that he was
not a factor and let play continue.
	   France squandered a chance to score in the 65th minute when
Christophe Dugarry was set up in the middle by Youri Djorkaeff.
After getting the cross from the right, the unmarked Dugarry
managed only a meek, low shot from 6 meters that was easily grabbed
Niemi.
	   Finland quickly countered, getting a header from Tomi Kinnunen
off a corner two minutes later that hit the post.
	   French head coach Aime Jacquet chose to play a flat back four
behind two defensive midfielders. Stephane Guivarc'h served as the
lone striker in front of three offensive midfielders.
	   The defense was caught in the fifth minute when Joonas Kolkka
played a deep ball to Jonatan Johansson, whose low shot was blocked
by a quickly advancing keeper Fabien Barthez, who had raced 10
meters off his line.

	   PENGURUSAN Dana Harta Nasional, the national asset management
company (AMC), will need about RM25 billion to acquire troubled
loans and assets in the banking system.
	   The AMC will initially raise RM10 billion through the issue of
bonds locally and abroad.
	   Of this, between US$1 billion and US$2 billion will be sourced
from the international bond market.
	   The bonds are Government-guaranteed.
	   Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim announced details of the AMC yesterday, two weeks after the
Government said it would form an asset management company to deal
with banks' non- performing loans (NPLs), which stood at 9.3 per
cent of total outstanding loans as in March.
	   The establishment of the AMC is aimed at reviving still-viable
assets and allowing banks to focus on their daily operations, both
of which the Government hopes would assist in the economy recovery.
	   Anwar told a press conference the Government will provide AMC an
initial grant of RM50 million as seed money for its establishment.
	   The company is expected to deal with its first NPL end-July.
	   After Anwar announced the proposal to set up AMC on May 20 and
the appointment of Amanah Capital Group executive director Azman
Yahya as AMC chief executive officer the next day, the AMC
appointed international consultants Arthur Andersen as its
strategic and operational adviser and JP Morgan as the financial
adviser.
	   A legal and regulatory framework for the establishment of the
agency is being worked out.
	   ``Once the draft is completed, we will table it at the next
Parliament sitting in July,'' Anwar said.
	   The legislation is to ensure that there will be enough legal and
regulatory capacity for the AMC to acquire the NPLs from banks.
	   Anwar said the Government may even hold a special Parliament
sitting later this month to speed up the legislative process.
	   Although the draft on the proposed legislation has yet to be
completed, Anwar said AMC can proceed to seek and study the viable
NPLs that it can acquire.
	   ``To do this, they do not need to wait for the legislation ...
they can proceed, full steam, right away but when it comes to
acquiring the NPLs and assets, this will be subjected to the
proposed Act to be passed by Parliament,'' he said.
	   It will operate in a rigorous transparent reporting regime,
including quarterly reports of the management's stewardship to the
stakeholders.
	   Anwar also said the Government currently holds the controlling
stake in AMC but this will be reduced gradually.
	   ``If possible, we (Government) do not hold the majority stake.
	   ``But based on the experience of other countries which have
similar asset management companies of this nature, the Government
will have to take the initiative.
	   ``Sovereign guarantee needs to be there to give the sense of
absolute support of the Government before this can take place. But
once it operates, it must do this independently,'' he added.
	   On participation of the private sector in the AMC, Anwar said,
the present AMC team is currently negotiating with numerous
interested parties.
	   ``Certainly, the private sector has given the undertaking to
participate.
	   In fact, when a consortium of banks said that they were prepared
to take up the majority or substantial stake in AMC, we said that
we have to look into this matter first,'' he said.
	   Anwar said based on the experience of other countries, there may
be difficulties when banks hold a majority stake in AMC especially
when the agency negotiates NPLs.
	   ``There may be a conflict of interest.
	   ``When they (banks) have a majority stake in the agency, they
will have an advantage.
	   ``If they want to participate, they should not hold a majority
stake,'' he added.
	   Anwar said the involvement of the private sector, including
foreign investors, in the AMC will be increased gradually.

International leaders call drug war a failure, urge Annan to
</HEADLINE>
rethink policy  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Saying the drug war has caused more harm
than drug abuse itself, prominent world figures are calling for ``a
truly open dialogue'' to shift drug control policies from
punishment to public health issues.
	   The call is being made in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan from the Lindesmith Center, a private institute which
conducts drug research, in advance of the U.N. General Assembly
special session on drugs, which opens Monday.
	   Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the center, said the letter has
been signed by more than 500 prominent people, including former
Secretary of State George Shultz, former Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, former Greek President George Papandreou, former
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and former German Justice
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.
	   ``We believe that the global war on drugs is now causing more
harm than drug abuse itself,'' the letter said. ``Human rights are
violated, environmental assaults perpetrated and prisons inundated
with hundreds of thousands of drug violators.''
	   The letter said scarce resources are being diverted ``on ever
more expensive interdiction efforts'' while ``realistic proposals
to reduce drug-related crime, disease and death'' are abandoned
``in favor of rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.''
	   ``Persisting in our current policies will only result in more
drug abuse, more empowerment of drug markets and criminals and more
disease and suffering,'' the letter said.
	   It appealed to Annan ``to initiate a truly open and honest
dialogue regarding the future of global drug policies _ one in
which fear, prejudice and punitive prohibitions yield to common
sense, science, public health and human rights.''
	   Nadelmann said the U.N. conference should consider the global
drug policy as a public heath issue, using the resources of U.N.
agencies such as the World Health Organization to devise policies
to replace those based on ``interdiction and criminalization.''
	   Representatives of about 150 countries, including 35 heads of
state and government, are to attend the three-day conference.
President Clinton will deliver the opening address Monday.
	   U.N. officials said the conference will focus on issues such as
ways to combat money-laundering, reducing demand, strengthening
judicial cooperation, regulating chemicals used to synthesize drugs
and eliminating illegal cultivation of poppy, cocoa and cannabis
crops.

Spaniard to get opener; Swiss to handle United States-Iran

  EDS: CORRECTS typo in Resende's first name.  
  With List  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jose Manuel Garcia Aranda of Spain, who officiated
the 1996 Olympic tournament in Atlanta, will referee the World Cup
opener between defending champion Brazil and Scotland, FIFA
announced Friday.
	   The 42-year-old Madrid physical education teacher has been a
referee since 1974 and an international field official since 1993.
He refereed the 1997 Toyota Cup final between Germany's Borussia
Dortmund and Brazil's Cruzeiro and also has overseen European
Champions League matches.
	   FIFA announced the referees for 34 of their early round matches,
with the remaining 14 games to be assigned referees by mid-June,
FIFA said. Each of the previously designated referees received one
match.
	   Swiss Urs Meier will get the politically charged match between
the United States and Iran on June 21 in Lyon. The 39-year-old with
21 years experience was the referee for last year's European
Champions Cup final between Dortmund and Manchester United.
	   The lowlands grudge match between longtime rivals Belgium and
the Netherlands at St. Denis on June 13 will be handled by
Pierluigi Collina, the internationally renown Italian who is easily
identifiable by his shaven scalp.
	   Collina handled the 1996 Olympic final between Nigeria and
Argentina as well as his regular Serie A duties.
	   The host's French's first game, against South Africa in
Marseille on June 12 was scheduled for Maurizio Rezende, a
37-year-old Brazilian who has officiated the Toyota Cup, Copa
Libertadores and South American SuperCup matches.

	   MBM Resources Bhd will provide RM50 million end-financing this
year for eligible customers who purchase Daihatsu vehicles from its
subsidiary Daihatsu (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
	   Managing director Datuk Abd Rahim Abd Halim said: ``MBM
Resources intends to raise RM15 million of the targeted RM50
million through long-term bank borrowings.''
	   For the first quarter of this year, the company - through its
wholly- owned subsidiary DMM Credit Sdn Bhd - has provided a RM12.5
million credit facility for its customers wishing to buy Daihatsu
vehicles.
	   MBM Resources holds a 71.5 per cent stake in Daihatsu Malaysia
which is the sole distributor of the Japanese-made Daihatsu
vehicles and the largest dealer of Perodua vehicles in the country.
	   Speaking at MBM Resources' annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur on
Wednesday, Abd Rahim said currently, customers who need credit
facility for Daihatsu trucks were charged only a four per cent
interest on the financed amount for the first two years.
	   ``(While) some of dealers provide discounts, we prefer to
subsidise the interest rate,'' he said, adding that interest rates
for other vehicles were about 10 per cent.
	   Last year, DMM Credit provided RM80 million end-financing to its
customers who purchased Daihatsu vehicles. Of the total, RM20
million was secured through long-term bank borrowings while the
balance was internally-funded.
	   For the year ended Dec 31, 1997, MBM Resources group pre-tax
profit declined 13 per cent to RM52.3 million from RM60.1 million
in the previous corresponding year.
	   Group turnover increased to RM860.2 million from RM851 million
in 1996.
	   A final dividend of eight sen has been recommended.
	   ``Daihatsu Malaysia contributed 70 to 80 per cent to the group
profit for the year ended Dec 31, 1997,'' Abd Rahim said.
	   In 1997, sales of Daihatsu vehicles dropped 22.5 per cent to
8,955 units while sales of Perodua vehicles declined 0.7 per cent
to 10,503 units.
	   ``For the first quarter of this year, we managed to break even.
What the future holds, we don't know.
	   ``It all depends on the economic situation and the monetary
control in the country,'' MBM Resources chairman Tan Sri Ahmad
Azizuddin Zainal Abidin said.
	   Ahmad Azizuddin said the economic problems and the increase in
interest rates would have a negative effect on sales of vehicles in
the country.
	   On its plans to expand regionally, he said MBM Resources has put
them on hold until the region recovers from the economic downturn.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some of the thousands fleeing the
latest Serbian offensive in Kosovo don't make it, dying of
exhaustion along the way. In villages wiped out by fighting,
corpses lie unburied and farm animals roam wild.
	   Reports said Friday that 50 people were killed and 200 were
missing in the past week. Survivors were hiding in the woods, most
trying to cross the border into neighboring Albania.
	   A statement by Serb police Friday indicated the offensive had
ended, having destroyed the ``terrorist gangs'' who tried to block
Kosovo's key north-south road. It said civilians could safely
return.
	   Still, hundreds continued to flee. Most were ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people and demand
independence from Serbia, the larger of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia. Serbian troops are trying to quash the separatist
drive.
	   In an unusually blunt statement, U.N. chief Kofi Annan accused
Serb forces of ``atrocities'' in Kosovo and demanded Friday that
``this kind of aggression'' be confronted immediately.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the European Union will
get involved in the Kosovo crisis, but offered no details.
	   Austria's foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel, said that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had promised him that
humanitarian organizations would have access to sealed off regions
of Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, who is thought to be behind the Serb crackdown in
Kosovo, also told Schuessel that refugees would be allowed to
return under U.N. control. But with similar promises made and often
broken in the Bosnian war, the fate of refugees remained unclear.
	   Some of the 400 refugees who trekked into Albania overnight
reported five deaths on the way _ two elderly people, said to have
died of exhaustion, and three small children, the U.N. refugee
agency in Geneva reported.
	   Albania is ill-equipped to handle the influx, and the EU said
Friday it will increase its dlrs 2.2 million aid package for Kosovo
_ perhaps doubling it _ to help Albania cope.
	   Most of the male refugees aren't staying out of danger for long,
instead stocking up on arms in Albania then returning to fight the
Serbs.
	   Horses and mules loaded with guns, vans without license plates
transporting men in camouflage uniforms and the sound of sporadic
gunfire make Tropoja, a northern Albanian town swamped by 10,000
refugees in recent days, look like a military base. Teen-agers are
being trained to shoot, and no attempt is being made to hide the
military preparations.
	   The reports of fighting in Kosovo were often conflicting and
could not be verified. Both Serbian police forces and gunmen from
the Kosovo Liberation Army block access to journalists and even
humanitarian workers.
	   The Beta news agency in Belgrade quoted unnamed refugees as
saying a mass grave contained 300 bodies on the outskirts of from
Decani, 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Kosovo's capital,
Pristina. There were no details.
	   Osman Cacaj, an official of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the
ethnic Albanians' main party, listed more than 50 dead and 200
missing from the latest offensive, concentrated around Decani.
	   He described the area around Decani as a deserted wasteland,
with 45 bodies left unburied and civilians hiding in the woods.
Four ethnic Albanian villages were destroyed, eight badly damaged,
and 16 others deserted, he said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leaders in
the province, said one Albanian was killed in fighting around
Orahovac, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina. It said
Serb shelling continued around Decani and in Kosovo's southwest.
	   The Serb police statement said there were no civilian
casualties. It said two policemen were killed and five wounded.
	   The Serb forces in Kosovo are using an armored personnel carrier
stolen from Dutch troops during the Bosnian war, the Dutch
government said Friday.
	   More than 250 people have died since March 1 in escalating
clashes between Serb forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, which Albanian
political leaders say acts independently.
	   Ethnic Albanians and officials chosen by Milosevic, who stripped
Kosovo of its broad autonomy in 1989, opened talks under Western
pressure last month. Agreement appears unlikely.
	   The ethnic Albanians canceled a meeting scheduled Friday in
Pristina, saying they could not talk with the Serbs while the
latest offensive lasts.

Pakistani minister tells Israeli media no nuclear cooperation with
</HEADLINE>
Iran  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare interview to an Israeli TV station,
Pakistan's minister of information said Friday that his country was
not cooperating with Iran on nuclear technology.
	   Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned
of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing
by Pakistan and India.
	   ``Pakistan has no cooperation with any other country on the
nuclear issue or the missile issue,'' Mushahid Hussein said in an
interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first
Muslim country to go nuclear.
	   Channel 2 however said that despite a lack of diplomatic
relations, Pakistan was open to the station's request for an
interview which was conducted with the help of a Pakistani
broadcast company.
	   Hussein tried to calm concerns in Israel that Pakistan might
share its capabilities and technology with other Muslim states.
	   ``It is the view of Pakistan that bombs do not have religions it
is unfair, unjust and wrong to qualify Pakistan's nuclear program
in religious terms,'' he said.
	   He said that Pakistan did not know the status of Iran's nuclear
program.``We have no idea about other countries' nuclear programs.
We have no idea what other countries in the region are doing, not
Iran, Iraq or Israel,'' he said.
	   He said the recent visit of Iran's foreign minister to Pakistan
following the tests had been scheduled in advance.
	   ``We hope that no other country would feel threatened by
Pakistan's nuclear program,'' he said.
	   Asked to comment on reports in Israel earlier this week that
Pakistan had feared an Israeli air strike hours before going ahead
with its nuclear tests. Hussein replied:``We are not saying that.
There have been reports in the Western press and Indian press on
that count but this is not Pakistan's official position.''

Settlers intensify campaign against West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with comment from Israeli Cabinet secretary  
  By KARIN LAUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing that government approval of a West Bank
troop withdrawal is imminent, Jewish settlers on Friday took senior
members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party on
flights over the disputed land in hopes of scuttling a pullback.
	   Settlers also threatened to establish at least two new Jewish
settlements if Netanyahu accepts a U.S. withdrawal proposal that
would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control
and restrict settlement expansion.
	   As a result of the withdrawal, ``the settlements are turning
into enclaves in Palestinian areas and in our view, this is a
life-and-death battle,'' said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   Under the American plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over a 12-week period, in exchange for Palestinian
security measures, such as collecting illegal weapons. Negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement would begin with the first pullback.
	   Two senior Palestinian negotiators were to brief Arafat later
Friday on their talks with the U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross.
	   Israel army radio said Ross asked the Palestinians to accept
several changes in the original U.S. proposal, but that report
could not be confirmed. A remaining sticking point is the scope of
an additional pullback promised by Israel.
	   Netanyahu wants assurances now that he will not have to hand
over more than 2 percent at the time, a demand rejected by the
Palestinians.
	   Despite continued disagreements, both Netanyahu and Arafat
seemed mildly optimistic in their assessments. Netanyahu said
Thursday that ``some progress'' had been made, while Arafat said he
was assured by U.S. mediators that a deal would be wrapped up by
mid-June.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dannny Naveh said a deal was likely
soon.
	   ``I hope that we can wrap up a deal in the next few days,''
Naveh told Israel TV.

	   UNIPHOENIX Corp Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amalgamated
Properties  Industries Bhd (APIB), on June 1 agreed to terminate
the conditional sale and purchase agreement with Wisma Denmark Sdn
Bhd (WDSB) for the proposed disposal of two ordinary shares of RM1
each representing the entire issued and paid-up capital in Comodo.
	   Following this, Comodo has agreed to sell and WDSB has agreed to
acquire 7.5 million ordinary shares of RM1 each representing 75 per
cent of the issued and paid-up capital of TSI Holdings Sdn Bhd for
RM13 million cash.
	   The sale consideration for the transaction was arrived at on a
willing buyer-willing seller basis after taking into account the
net tangible assets of TSI.
	   The disposal is not expected to have any material effect on the
earnings of the Uniphoenix group for the financial year ending June
30 1998.
	   However, an extraordinary loss of about RM2.6 million is
expected, which will lower the net tangible assets of the group by
the same amount.

Germany routs Luxembourg part-timers 7-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ After Germany's 7-0 victory Friday over
Luxembourg's part-timers, the guessing game over who will start for
Germany at the World Cup won't get any easier.
	   Most of the players German coach Berti Vogts challenged to prove
belonged in his starting lineup had no problems shining against the
overmatched Duchey in the team's final World Cup tuneup.
	   ``I'm happy I've got a team where I have two good players for
each position,'' said Vogts, who refuses to name his starting
lineup.
	   Juergen Klinsmann, fighting for a striker position, headed in a
15th minute goal and assisted on a second. Midfielder Christian
Ziege scored in the 85th and defender Thomas Helmer in the 28th
minute as both strengthened their claim on a starting role.
	   Midfielder Joerg Heinrich, who seemed to have misplayed himself
onto the bank, launched a perfect seventh minute cross cross that a
sliding Ulf Kirsten blasted in with an outstretched leg.
	   Kirsten, Klinsmann's main rival, added a second goal in the
45th. Oliver Bierhoff, a sure bet to start alongside one or the
other in France, struck twice in the 56th and 72nd and now has
scored 17 goals in 27 caps.
	   Luxembourg's players, with only one full-time professional,
offered little resistance as the Germans strived to display their
best side for Vogts.
	   ``It was a good training session for us, nothing more,''
shrugged Bierhoff.
	   The Germans had a much easier time with Luxembourg than
Cameroon, another World Cup team, which struggled to a 2-0 victory
Sunday.
	   After a scoreless draw against Finland, Germany turned in an
impressive 3-1 victory Saturday against Colombia. For Vogts, the
last two outings are a clear sign the team is reaching its stride
before the June 15 opener against the United States.
	   ``There were too many loose passes as far as I'm concerned, but
it's getting better and better,'' said Vogts. ``I wanted a clear
improvement over Colombia and I got it.''
	   Luxembourg didn't have a real shot on goal until the 79th minute
when Serge Thill found himself loose at the edge of the box but
shot the ball straight into keeper Jens Lehmann's hands.
	   As an indication of Luxembourg's nearly amatuer status, Thill
had been inserted late in the match for Gordon Braun, a forward
busy cramming for college exams.
	   Klinsmann, who proved he's recovered from an injury, and Kirsten
continued their fierce battle to claim the second forward start.
	   Vogts has already called his striker foursome, which also
includes FC Kaiserslautern's Olaf Marschall, the best the German
team has boasted since the 1970 World Cup.
	   LINEUPS:
	   Germany: Andreas Koepke (Jens Lehmann, 46th minute) , Olaf Thon
(Stefan Reuter 74th), Christian Woerms, Juergen Kohler (Markus
Babbel 46th), Joerg Heinrich, Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Matthaeus
46th), Thomas Helmer (Michael Tarnat 46th), Christian Ziege,
Andreas Moeller (Olaf Marschall 59th), Ulf Kirsten (Oliver Bierhoff
46th) and Juergen Klinsmann.
	   Luxembourg _ Philippe Felgen, Marc Birsen, Frank Deville, xxxxxx
Vanek, Laurent Deville, Dany Theis, Jeff Saibene, Joel Groff, Ralph
Ferron (Luc Holtz 64th) , Manuel Cardoni and Gordon Braun (Serge
Thill 59th).
	   Referee: Fritz Stuchlik. Attendance: 25,000.

Taliban denounces UN invitation to ousted government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Islamic Taliban on Friday condemned
``in the strongest terms'' a U.N. invitation to followers of ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani to attend next week's U.N. drug
conference.
	   ``The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns in the strongest
terms a United Nations invitation to the so-called northern
alliance to represent Afghanistan'' at the conference, the
Taliban's representation office in New York said in a statement.
	   ``By receiving the northern alliance, the United Nations confers
undue legitimacy and international status to these warlords,'' the
statement said.
	   The Taliban army drove Rabbani from the capital Kabul in 1996
and now controls about 85 percent of the country. Rabbani's
northern-based alliance controls about 15 percent of the territory
and has been battling the Taliban.
	   Although Taliban holds the capital and most of the territory,
the United Nations has never awarded the General Assembly seat to
the Islamic movement. The seat remains in the hands of the previous
government pending a final decision.
	   Afghanistan is a leading source of opium-poppies, most of which
are grown in Taliban-controlled areas. The Taliban has agreed to
work with the United Nations to curb production and encourage
farmers to grow alternate crops.
	   But U.N. officials said so long as the General Assembly does not
remove the seat, the former leadership will still be entitled to
attend U.N. conferences as the legitimate government of
Afghanistan.

A closer look at the wheel that broke
</HEADLINE>
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   Investigators confirmed Friday that wheel failure was the focus
of their probe into Wednesday's high-speed train crash.
	   CONSTRUCTION:
	   A shock-absorbing rubber ring encases a steel disc, the actual
wheel. The entire construction is encircled by a reinforced steel
tire. The tire also functions as a rim that helps keep the wheels
on the track.
	   The wheel system, or bogie, is comprised of four wheels and
brake discs and is located at each end of a car.
	   Each ICE train rides on 80 to 100 wheels, depending on the
number of cars, with eight wheels per carriage.
	   WHAT INVESTIGATORS KNOW:
	   A stray strip of steel, identified as part of the tire, was
found wedged in the bogie. Damaged ties and a switchbox six
kilometers (3.7 miles) from the accident suggest this is where the
tire broke apart. Unidentified pieces of the train were found at
the site.
	   Investigators theorize that the train derailed 300 meters (985
feet) before reaching the overpass.
	   WHO MAKES THE WHEELS:
	   The Hamburg-based company Bochum produced the wheels and bogies
for the 60 first-generation InterCity Express high-speed trains.
Bochum spokesman Goetz-Peter Blumbach said a faulty wheel on an ICE
would be unprecedented.
	   The bogie system was designed especially for Germany's InterCity
Express, and is not used on any other trains. However, other trains
in Europe use the wheel design.

	   TENAGA Nasional Bhd said the RM1.5 billion for the system
upgrade of Sabah Electricity Board was based on a load forecast
made last year and the capital expenditure will only be made after
a yearly review of the projection.
	   There has been no capital spending so far since it is for the
seven-year period starting from 1999 to 2005, it added.
	   Tenaga confirmed that it received an offer to lead a consortium
to take over Sabah Electricity Board from the Economic Planning
Unit in the Prime Minister's Department in March this year.
	   Under the terms of the offer, Tenaga will hold 60 per cent of
the equity interest in the consortium while the remaining 40 per
cent will be held equally by the Sabah Government and Petronas.
	   As a proactive step, Tenaga incorporated a wholly-owned
subsidiary company known as Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd with a
paid-up capital of RM100 and an authorised capital of RM10 million.
	   The directors of the company are Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin Ali,
who is chief executive officer of Tenaga, and Datuk Fuad Jaafar,
the senior general manager (energy supply) and executive director
of Tenaga.
	   The company, however, is still dormant and will be used as the
vehicle for privatization after all pertinent agreements have been
signed.
	   Terms of the privatization are still being negotiated and
drafted, Tenaga said, and to date no agreement has been finalised
or signed by the parties.
	   The process involves the privatization agreement, the
shareholders agreement, the terms and conditions of employment and
the licence to be issued by the director-general of the Electric
Supply  Gas Department.

	   THE winding-up petition filed by Mr Tan Cheng Teik against
Singer (M) Sdn Bhd will not have any financial effect and
operational impact on the group.
	   Singer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berjaya Singer Bhd, is
solvent and is conducting its business as usual and continues to
register profit, the group said in a statement.
	   The winding-up petition dated March 25 1998 was issued pursuant
to Section 218 of the Companies Act 1965 and is grounded upon
Singer's non- payment of RM56,996.70 as judgement sum and costs due
to the judgement-in- default entered by Tan on April 23 1997. The
winding-up petition has been fixed for hearing on June 23.
	   Singer is contesting Tan's counter-claim and will take immediate
steps to set aside the default judgement and to stay the winding-up
petition.
	   Singer said in its statement that Tan is a former Singer shop
manager in Bukit Mertajam who was dismissed for mismanagement and
was sued by the company for shortages of stock amounting to
RM152,195 in 1994. However, Tan filed a counter-claim for RM49,270
against Singer for monies allegedly due to him.
	   Singer did not attend the mention of the suit against Tan on
April 23 last year and, as a result, it suit was struck off and a
judgement-in- default was entered in Tan's counter-claim against
the group on the same date.

	   PARIS (AP) _ It was a bit confusing. The chair umpire kept
announcing ``Game Mademoiselle Williams'' or ``Advantage
Mademoiselle Williams'' throughout the match. But it was unclear
who he was referring to.
	   There were occasional bead-clearing breaks on the court. And the
winner and the loser could both say ``Hi, Mom'' to the same person.
	   That's what happens when the Williams sisters play on opposite
sides.
	   Venus Williams, with Justin Gimselstob, beat younger sister
Serena, partnered by Luis Lobo, in the mixed doubles final of the
French Open on Friday, 6-4, 6-4.
	   It was the second consecutive Grand Slam victory for Venus and
Gimselstob, having won the same event in January at the Australian
Open.
	   ``We're closer to a Grand Slam than a lot of other people,''
Venus said. No other singles players are in the running to win both
titles.''
	   Venus knows why she wanted Gimelstob as a partner.
	   ``I needed to play with someone with similar height so I can
feel comfortable,'' said Venus, who is 6-foot-1 1/2 (1.83 meters).
``And the other person would also feel comfortable and not lose
confidence or any manhood.''
	   Serena, with green beads, took the early advantage over her
older sister, with blue beads, opening up a 4-1 lead and a few
chances to make it 5-1, with points delayed because of bead pickup
duty.
	   Then Venus and her partner settled down and took the next five
games to win the first set.
	   The second set went on serve until the seventh game, when Serena
double faulted at game point to put Venus ahead 4-3.
	   Venus held her serve the next game to go up 5-3, and the winners
maintainted their advatange the rest of the way.
	   Next is the Wimbledon mixed doubles.
	   ``We practiced together once this time and twice in Australia,''
Gimelstob said. ``Maybe we will practice at Wimbledon.''
	   The sisters have met in tournamentd only twice in their singles
careers, in the second round of this year's Australian Open and in
the quarterfinals of the Italian Open. Venus won both matches.
	   Venus said she didn't play women's doubles here with Serena
because of the slowness of the clay, but looks forward to a
partnership with her eventually.
	   Venus' share of the dlrs 58,000 mixed doubles prize and Serena's
share of the dlrs 35,000 runner-up prize make a considerable
donation to the Williams family, who were in the stands.

	   KEN Holdings Bhd plans to diversify the group's business into
other related fields and expand into regional and international
markets to achieve a more balanced earnings base.
	   The group, involved in construction and civil engineering works,
currently has subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.
	   In Hong Kong, its subsidiary Kenly (HK) Ltd has secured
specialised engineering projects in micro tunnelling equipment says
Mr Tan Boon Kang in his latest executive chairman's statement.
	   He added with a notable increase in slope stabilisation projects
in Hong Kong, the group is confident of further expanding its
specialised engineering services in areas such as soil nailing,
anchoring and other slope protection services to the region which
in return will generate foreign exchange earnings for Ken Holdings.
	   Tan also said that the group is looking at the possibility of a
systematic expansion into other related services in areas like
project management, design and contracting in Hong Kong and China.
	   While on the local front, he said, the group's proposed property
development project in Petaling Jaya which was expected to generate
sales revenue of RM170 million had to be deffered due to the
current economic slowdown.
	   Meanwhile, for the year ended December 31 1997, Ken Holdings
registered a lower group pre tax profit of RM5.01 million against
RM10.29 million in the previous corresponding period.
	   Turnover for the year improved to RM91.43 million from RM74.36
million but after tax profit fell to RM2.54 million from RM7.22
million the last time around.
	   Earnings per share meanwhile dropped to 12 sen from 36 sen in
1996.
	   Directors have recommended a first and final gross dividend of 7
per cent.

	   A PETROL price war may be imminent if Petroliam Nasional Bhd
(Petronas) decides to join the fray and reduce petrol prices to
defend its market share.
	   ``We are ready to do what needs to be done to protect our market
share.
	   However, before we do anything, we want to know how far everyone
goes.
	   ``As the national oil company, our subsidiary Petronas Dagangan
is ready to push the button,'' Petronas president and chief
executive Tan Sri Hassan Marican told reporters after the annual
general meeting of Petronas Gas Bhd yesterday.
	   Hassan alluded to a similar situation in the 1990s when one oil
company provided gifts and incentives to its customers in a big way
and this destabilised the industry. However, that was a non-petrol
issue, he said.
	   ``Even then, Petronas was the last company to join the price
war. This is happening again and it has gone into the petrol
business. It has created instability in the market place,'' he
added.
	   Hassan said Petronas will be proactive and is holding
discussions with other oil companies to determine the type of
environment for the petrol industry.
	   ``We will have to assess how the industry wants to conduct its
business from now on because once a particular type of environment
takes place, there is no looking back,'' said Hassan.
	   According to him, the national oil company's 30 per cent market
share in the retail business has not been affected much.
	   Major foreign oil companies have introduced gifts, incentives
and price cuts to attract customers.
	   Unleaded petrol is priced at RM1.10 a litre currently, while
leaded is slightly higher at RM1.13 a litre. Petrol prices are
regulated by the Government.
	   Hassan who is also chairman of Petronas Gas, said the
participation of Petronas Gas in the Centralised Utility Facilities
(CUF) project is the group's biggest commitment so far.
	   The project, which will come on stream between 1999 and 2000,
will supply value-added utilities such as steam, electricity,
oxygen, nitrogen, demineralised water, waste water treatment and
compressed air to the Integrated Petrochemical Complexes in Kertih
(Terengganu) and Gebeng (Kuantan) as well as other plants in the
surrounding areas.
	   Hassan said six contracts for the CUF are now being tendered
out.
	   A major portion of the financing for the project will come from
internally-generated funds and the balance from local borrowings.
The project will have an impact on the revenue of Petronas Gas only
in the following financial year, he said.
	   ``With the first production of the CUF in July 1999, Petronas
Gas will slowly transform itself from a mere transporter and
processor of gas to a utility-based group,'' Hassan said.
	   However, he stressed that gas will still be the main contributor
to the group's profits.
	   On the performance of Petronas Gas during the current financial
year, Hassan said the volume of gas to be transported is expected
to increase.
	   This is because 70 per cent of the group's customers are power
companies, which include Tenaga Nasional Bhd and independent power
producers, and growth in electricity consumption is expected to
rise.
	   Gas Processing Plants (GPP) Five and Six are expected to start
operations in stages from the middle of this year. The company's
production capacity will eventually increase to 2,000 million
standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) from 1,000 mmscfd currently.
	   More than RM1 billion was invested in the two processing plants.

	   IN PAULINE Hanson's One Nation party lies the danger of
Australia drifting away from Asia. Although anti-Asian sentiment is
not something shared by most Australians, the impression given
through newspaper reports is that it has garnered quite a bit of
support Down Under. Asians residing and working in Australia are
living anxiously, even if the national elections will not be held
until later this year. The prospect of Hanson sinking the
Conservative Government of John Howard at the electiosn requires
stretching the average imagination, but it is a daunting thought
nonetheless.
	   One Nation is seen by Asians living in Australia as a potential
direct threat to their own future and security. To Asians in
general, it is viewed as the advocate of an abominable dogma which
could lead to very unpleasant relations between Canberra and its
Asian neighbours. The saving grace, since Hanson first hit the
headlines nearly two years ago, is that her anti-Asian feelings
have not been matched by anti-Australian sentiments. But in some
countries in Asia where races have lived and worked together
peacefully for decades, people are only too aware of what racial
tension could lead to. Should Hanson come to power, Australia's
foreign policy towards countries like Malaysia would certainly
change, and vice-versa. Anti-Pauline Hanson feelings could turn
into something stronger and uglier.
	   Like its neighbours, Malaysians are quite concerned with
developments related to this issue in Australia. Some of us have
children studying in universities there or relatives and friends
who have settled down in that country. Bilaterally, there are
genuine concerns that all that has been painstakingly built over
the years could come to naught. Malaysia and Australia have seen
improved relations over the past few years despite more than a few
hiccups. Canberra's ties with other Asian countries have also been
good, even after the region started feeling the pangs of the
financial problems that hit it in July last year. The anti-Asian
policy, for all intents and purposes, must be viewed as a time-bomb
capable of destroying the spirit of cooperation between friendly
nations.
	   For decades, Canberra has also assumed quite a prominent role in
matters relating to the Asia Pacific region. Australia's
brainchild, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec), is now an
important forum to discuss economic matters involving countries in
the Asia Pacific. Australia's trading and investment ties with
countries in the Association of South- East Asian Nations (Asean)
has also been significant. Last year alone, trade between Australia
and Asean stood at about US$22 billion (US$1    3.92). Australian
companies operating in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have
performed well during the good times and many are staying put
despite the downturn, reflecting their confidence and comfort in
operating in these countries.
	   Choosing the next Australian Prime Minister is the democratic
right of Australians, something that democratic Asians will not
even want to question. If Australians by and large want Hanson to
lead them, then so be it. Australia's neighbours in Asia, however,
are justified in feeling anxious about how the former chip-shop
owner will strategise her foreign policy with regards to
strengthening bilateral ties with other countries if she indeed
became the premier. As Asia struggles with its economic problems,
it is looking to its friends near and far to help make things
easier. Australia, as an economic powerhouse, has quite some means
to extend a helping hand to Asia although its own economy is
already feeling the contagion effects of the region's financial
turmoil. It could buy more from the countries in the region or even
participate in barter or counter trade with the countries affected.
By helping the Asian economies in trouble, Australia would be
helping check the spread of the contagion effect. But Asia will
certainly have to leave it to Australia to either swim nearer to
this region in trouble, or drift farther away.

	   CAMBRIDGE 2020, the initiative that will bring together the
divergent resources of the university town to create a region with
the economic power of US' Silicon Valley, was sparked off by
Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor.
	   Dr David Cleevely, managing director of Analysys Ltd, a
Cambridge-based telecommunications consultancy, told Business Times
in an interview that the Malaysian visit to the UK last year to
promote the MSC engendered a realisation in Cambridge that it would
have to come up with an overall plan to put to the best use all its
resources, or risk being left behind.
	   He said in May last year, Analysys, which has an office in the
MSC, organised a visit to Cambridge for about 60 members of the
Malaysian delegation promoting the MSC.
	   After the visit, some Cambridge companies, financiers and
members of the faculty got together at a dinner hosted by the
university to promote links between the university and local
industry.
	   Most of those who were at this dinner had either attended Dr
Mahathir's presentation on the MSC at the Imperial College or met
with the members of the Malaysian delegation. So, the conversation
at most tables revolved around the MSC.
	   After the dinner, Cleevely said, speaker after speaker stood up
and talked about what the Malaysian delegates had said, pointing
out that this was clearly the way forward and it would have to be
taken seriously.
	   They realised that while Cambridge, one of the oldest
universities in the world, and the ``heartland for
telecommunications'' was sitting on considerable resources, it
lacked a cohesive plan to bring all these resources together.
	   ``Each little enterprise is pursuing its own line without
reference to the others and if countries like Malaysia is coming up
with initiatives like the MSC, there is a chance that, despite its
resources, Cambridge will get left behind,'' Cleevely pointed out.
	   He added that during the dinner he (Cleevely), Cambridge
University vice-chancellor Sir Alec Broers, Hermann Hauser who
founded Acorn as well as 20 other companies and runs Microsoft's
venture capital company, Amadeus, in Cambridge and Louis McCagg who
is involved in Cambridge Futures, were sitting at the same table
discussing what needed to be done to meet this challenge.
	   ``This got confirmed by over a third of the entire dinner who
stood up and said something about Malaysia,'' he said.
	   Cleevely said there were two main areas for Cambridge to get
right - marketing and an internal policy to encourage cohesion
between the companies.
	   ``Everybody is talking about what a fantastic job the Malaysians
are doing marketing the MSC.
	   ``Marketing Cambridge is crucial because people do not
understand what is going on here.
	   ``This is the heartland of telecommunications. You would be
astonished at how much the world has changed because of things that
have come out of Cambridge,'' he said.
	   Among its many achievements are the development of the first
optic fibre cable, most of research for the PCN and GSM handsets,
the first data network and the first digital computer.
	   He added that the idea of digital communications was also first
propounded in Cambridge and the first packet switch network in the
world was developed and constructed here.
	   Hauser, Broers and Cleevely had breakfast some four weeks later
and invited Professor Marcial Echenique of ME  Partners Urban
Planning to discuss the matter further and they began to get a
clearer idea of what needed to be done.
	   Later, Cleevely called up Alcatel's marketing director Peter
Radley who agreed to sponsor a report looking at how to optimise
the communications and information technology in Cambridge.
Analysys came up with the report entitled Cambridge 2020.
	   ``We're looking at a 20-25 year time scale. 2020 is a great
number and the Malaysians used it first. We `filched' it because we
don't see why we shouldn't borrow some ideas.
	   ``Dr Mahathir started the whole process and if it hadn't been
for him coming here, this would never have happened,'' he said.
	   ``This'' would essentially be a comprehensive plan for the
creation of a region similar in economic power to the Silicon
Valley. ``Before, we never had a coherent policy to put in the kind
of physical, economic and social infrastructure you would need to
achieve this.''
	   At the moment, he said, though Cambridge hosts the highest
concentration of high-tech activity in Europe, it is small compared
to global rivals, notably the Silicon Valley.
	   Giving some comparative figures, he said, Silicon Valley has a
population of 2.3 million, employs 1.2 million in its high-tech
industries, its exports are worth some E25 billion (E1    RM6.41) a
year and it had 3,575 new start-ups in the 1994/1995 period. The
average per annum wage in Silicon Valley is E30,000.
	   Cambridgeshire, on the other hand, has a population of 694,000,
employs 35,000 in its high-tech industries, its exports are worth
some E744 million a year and it had 87 new business start-ups in
the same period.
	   The average wage there is E19,000 per annum.
	   Cleevely added that the development fits in with the splitting
up of the UK into a series of economic regions. Cambridge happens
to be at the geographical centre of the Eastern region.
	   ``If we take into account the whole Eastern region, instead of
having a city of 100,000 people, we would have a region of 6
million people and can draw on a lot more resources and a lot of
space.
	   ``Encompassed in the region are the British Telecom (BT)
research laboratories in Harlow, Northern Telecom's (Nortel)
laboratories where all the early work on optical fibre cable
transmission was done, also in Harlow.
	   Cleevely said at the moment, the priority for getting Cambridge
2020 off the ground, is to get the information planning guidelines
of the region approved within the next 12 months.
	   Then over the next three to four years, it will need to
implement the critical elements of infrastructure including
housing, transport, communications and social infrastructure
linking matters such as local government, health, medicine and
learning.
	   ``After that, it has to be self-sustaining because it is going
to have to be obvious that growth is being generated to justify
further investment,''
	   he pointed out.
	   Analysys will be organising a seminar on regulating multimedia
and telecommunications at the Legend Hotel on June 23.

	   TOKYO: Malaysia has begun to lobby for global support for its
proposal to reform the present international financial system,
particularly to curb the damaging activities of currency
speculators.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has on many
occasions been vocal on the subject, on Tuesday presented the case
to an audience of businessmen and economists in Tokyo.
	   Speaking at the Institute for International Monetary Affairs'
symposium on ``Revitalisation of the Japanese Economy and the
Future of Asia'', he said the present system is ``messy, unreliable
and destructive''.
	   Dr Mahathir said there should be a new system which will bring
about stability of exchange rates, among other things. Fixed
exchange rate is no longer possible or realistic since political,
economic and social performance of a country will have an effect on
the currency.
	   He said to gauge the economy, various indices could be given
points to indicate the strength of the economy and therefore the
currency.
	   Economists could, for example, devise a measurement of the
economic performance of a country using the political, economic and
social indicators and then determine the relative values of
currencies.
	   Dr Mahathir began his speech by criticising, among others, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), reminding the audience of how
the world body had given Malaysia a clean bill of health and
praised the country's economic fundamentals just two weeks before
the ``currency hurricane''
	   struck the region.
	   ``I cite all this in order to address all those extremist
``market fundamentalists'' who believe that the market is always
right and that the reason why so many of us are in desperate
straits today is because we mismanaged our economies and because
all our ``fundamentals'' were rotten to the core.
	   ``If all our fundamentals are wrong, why were the foreign
investors so eager and so foolish as to pour billions upon billions
of investment dollars in our region? If our fundamentals were
rotten to the core, why did all the clever analysts not say so?''
he asked.
	   Dr Mahathir said yet these same people continue to predict, to
be believed in and to influence the market. If it is wrong for
insiders to leak information which can affect share prices, he
said, then it should also be wrong for forecasters to forecast
something which influences the market to their advantage.
	   When the Prime Minister was addressing the audience, seated no
more than 2 metres away was IMF first deputy managing director Mr
Stanley Fischer, who sat noticeably quiet throughout, taking notes.
	   Dr Mahathir left the symposium during the coffee break after his
speech as he had another appointment in his heavily scheduled
five-day working visit here, including individual meetings with
high-ranking Japanese businessmen.
	   Fischer, the first to speak as the symposium resumed, was
expected to respond to Dr Mahathir's speech and this he did.
``Before I begin, I would like to respond to some of the statements
made in the earlier session,''
	   Fischer said as he took to the podium.
	   While admitting that there should be work towards a better
international financial system, he said any effort to do so should
not impose restrictions on the currencies in which trade can take
place. This would set the world back to ``pre-World War
arrangements'' such as bilateral balanced trade, which he argued
was the way to slow and not resume progress.
	   ``Globalisation really has two aspects. One of them is opening
to trade, and it is extraordinary to hear globalisation fiercely
criticised in this region, which more than any other had benefited
over the last 40 years from the opening of the world economy and
the developing of international trade,'' Fischer said.
	   He said the unprecedented gains seen in East Asia would not have
been possible without the opening of the world economy.
	   ``We should not, under no circumstances, ignore that fact or
imagine that there is some solution that would benefit countries in
this region or anywhere that seeks to withdraw from a globalised
system,'' Fischer added.
	   This is indeed a very weak response. First of all, who said
anything about withdrawing from a globalised system? Malaysia has
long accepted the fact that globalisation is inevitable.
	   It is merely pointing out the dangers that globalisation poses
to developing economies. Precisely for this reason, various
measures are being taken in Malaysia and elsewhere to prepare
domestic economies for even greater globalisation in the future.
	   And what about ``restrictions on currencies in which trade can
take place'' that Fischer speaks of. If one understands Dr
Mahathir's position correctly, reform is an exact necessity to
allow the use of currencies in world trade.
	   As long as currency speculation continues unchecked, currencies
can be appreciated and devaluated in the space of several minutes
or seconds. How is that going to help trade?
	   Malaysia's proposal for bilateral balanced trade, which has
already been endorsed and practised within Asean, is a perfectly
logical measure to minimise the effect of their respective currency
depreciations against the US dollar. At least, they are doing
something about it.
	   If both parties agree to use their own currencies to trade, how
can that be wrong? Isn't that their choice to make? Or is criticism
against this practice based more on the currency in the critic's
wallet than on economic principles?

Netherlands crushes Nigeria 5-1 in final World Cup warm-up
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE CORDER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Marc Overmars led the Netherlands
to a crushing 5-1 victory over Nigeria Friday, scoring one goal and
setting up two as the Dutch tore apart the Olympic champion down
both flanks.
	   It was both teams' last tune-up before the World Cup finals
which begin June 10 in France.
	   The Netherlands dominated the match, playing a fluent and fast
passing game that cracked open Nigeria's defense and left the
African side little chance to build up attacks.
	   Speedy left winger Overmars tormented Nigeria with explosive
bursts of pace down the flank.
	   Inevitably, it was Overmars who tore away from his marker and
crossed to set up the Netherlands' opening goal. Striker Patrick
Kluivert was muscled off the ball but Leeds United marksman Jimmy
Hasselbaink was on hand at the far post to slam a shot high into
Nigeria's net in the 32nd minute.
	   Minutes earlier, the Dutch nearly capped a slick passing move
with a goal but Hasselbaink's shot was saved by Nigerian goalkeeper
Peter Rufai.
	   Nigeria almost replied immediately as Victor Ikpeba cut inside
Jaap Stam to create room for a shot but could only blast over the
bar.
	   The Dutch took a deserved 2-0 lead in the 38th minute through
dangerman Overmars. Latching onto a long pass out of defense,
Overmars saw Rufai rushing off his line and deftly lobbed the ball
into the net.
	   Shortly after the break Hasselbaink nearly netted his second
goal and the Netherlands' third when a diagonal pass from Kluivert
left him with only substitute goalkeeper William Okpara to beat.
Hasselbaink delayed his shot until Okpara dived, but Okpara managed
to stick out a hand and deflect the shot wide.
	   But the Netherlands stretched its lead on the hour through
Kluivert _ again following an Overmars cross from the left.
	   Nigeria reduced the lead in the 64th minute, Nwankwo Kanu
shooting a penalty past his former Ajax teammate Edwin van der Sar
after Winston Bogarde had fouled Daniel Amokachi.
	   The goal spurred Nigeria on and first defender Taribo West saw a
shot deflected to safety and then Kanu badly sliced a shot after
being released by Amokachi.
	   But the Netherlands stretched ahead again in the 74th minute
from a fast break with Clarence Seedorf crossing from the right and
Kluivert lashing in his second goal from close range.
	   Substitute Pierre van Hooijdonk made it 5-1 in the 77th minute,
guiding in a cross from Overmars' replacement Boudewijn Zenden.
	   The Netherlands takes on South Korea, Belgium and Mexico in
qualifying Group E while Nigeria plays Spain, Bulgaria and Paraguay
in Group D.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar, Jaap Stam (Winston Bogarde, 45),
Frank de Boer, Arthur Numan, Ronald de Boer (Wim Jonk, 45), Patrick
Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf, Phillip Cocu (Edgar Davids, 45), Marc
Overmars (Boudewijn Zenden, 75), Aron Winter, Jimmy Hasselbaink
(Pierre van Hooijdonk, 75).
	   Nigeria:
	   Peter Rufai (William Okpara, 45), Jero Shakpoke (Augustine
Eguavoen, 21, Austin Okacha 45), Uche Okechukwu, Taribo West,
Celestine Babayaro, Godwin Okpara, Sunday Oliseh, Finidi George
(Tijani Babangida, 45), Nwankwo Kanu (Wilson Oruma, 81), Victor
Ikpeba (Daniel Amokachi, 45), Garba Lawal.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Blowing horns and whistles,
waving flags and banners, thousands of fans streamed towards Kosevo
stadium Friday for the final of Bosnia's soccer championship.
	   The duel featured eternal rivals Zeljeznicar and Sarajevo _ but
the real prize was something Bosnia's disunited soccer teams have
not known: a ticket to the European Championship League for the
winner.
	   ``This may not be a World Cup match, but it is incredibly
important for the Bosnian football,'' said Liam McDowall, a U.N.
spokesman.
	   Almost all of the 40,000 tickets were sold out in a match that
served as a final preparation for monitoring the World Cup from
armchairs in front of TV screens. Zeljeznicar won 1-0, bringing
tears _ of joy or disappointment - from both teams and five minutes
of glorious fireworks after the match
	   Neighboring Yugoslavia and Croatia are competing in France, but
Bosnia's soccer has been as disunited as the country itself and the
national team had no chance of qualifying.
	   This year, for the first time since war erupted in 1992, soccer
teams from Bosnian Croat- and Muslim-dominated regions competed for
the national championship. Four from the Muslim regions and two
Croat sides competed in two groups.
	   Claiming security concerns, teams from the Bosnian Serb substate
_ Republika Srpska _ refused to participate. But everybody expects
them aboard in the next season.
	   It has taken three years for international sports organizations
and foreign diplomats charged with implementing peace to negotiate
a solution for Bosnia's disunited sports.
	   The 4-2 Muslim-Croat combination was also adopted for this
year's Bosnian basketball championships _ which the Serbs are also
expected to join in 1999. The Croat side Siroki Brijeg defeated
Sarajevo's Bosna, former European champions, for the local
basketball crown.
	   In recent weeks, the two groups in soccer played in Sarajevo and
the tense southwestern town of Mostar. Hundreds of fans traveled
back and forth without incident _ to the delight of Western
diplomats still trying to overcome ethnic tensions.
	   ``Even a year ago ... it would have been very difficult to
imagine such games take place in Mostar without any trouble,'' said
Martin Garrod, senior international official in Mostar.
	   Fearing ethnic riots, U.N. police closely monitored each game.
	   Fans simply wanted to see the best players.
	   ``There was the war, but it's over now,'' said Sead Beric, a
Zeljeznicar fan, heading for the stadium. ``Now, without all good
players, whether they are Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Jews,
Eskimos or others, we cannot hope to become something in world
soccer and participate in the next World Cup.''

Vicor to buy Japan Tobacco's power supply assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANDOVER, Massachusetts. (AP) _ Vicor Corp. said Friday it agreed
to acquire the principal assets of two money-losing power supply
businesses owned by Japan Tobacco Inc.
	   Terms of the transaction, expected to close this month, were not
disclosed.
	   Vicor, based in Andover, Massachusetts, manufactures power
systems and modular power components. It had revenue of dlrs162
million in 1997.
	   Japan Tobacco, based in Tokyo, is Japan's former tobacco and
salt monopoly. It now makes tobacco products and is diversifying
primarily in pharmaceuticals, food, agribusiness, real-estate and
engineering. It had sales of 3.6 trillion yen (dlrs26 billion) in
the year ended March 31.
	   Vicor said it will purchase the customer lists of JT Electronics
Corp. and all of the automated manufacturing equipment used by JT
PowerCraft Corp. for manufacture of modular converter products, as
well as its raw materials and finished goods inventories.
	   Vicor will move JT PowerCraft's manufacturing operations,
including equipment, to Andover. Japan Tobacco will close JT
Electronics, and Vicor will establish a direct sales presence in
Japan through a new company called Vicor Japan Co.
	   Japan Tobacco expects losses of 8 billion yen from the sale of
the businesses.

high yesterday, on selective buying interest on blue-chips.
	   KLSE's key barometer gained momentum in the afternoon when it
rose close to 14 points after closing three points higher by noon
break.
	   The gain was later trimmed as some index-linked stocks succumbed
to selling pressure when local and foreign players sold to lock in
profits.
	   Analysts said shares extended its technical rebound on Tuesday
on buying support by local and foreign funds which were seen
covering short positions.
	   However, trading is expected to remain thin and any rebound on
the bourse is expected to be shortlived over concerns on the
shrinking economy and corporate earnings.
	   The KLCI was up 5.75 points to 526.36 compared with Tuesday's
close of 520.61.
	   The KLSE's Second Board closed 0.70 point higher to 111.19 while
the broader Emas Index rose 1.47 points to close at 134.48.
	   The scoreboard showed gainers outpacing losers 394 to 173 with
171 counters remained unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries gained 1.31 to 127.59 while the
30-share New Straits Industrial Index lost 18.26 points to close at
3,050.96.
	   On the KLSE yesterday turnover was higher at 126.150 million
shares valued at RM267.512 billion yesterday compared with 111.150
million shares valued at RM246.766 billion traded on Tuesday.
	   Turnover on the main board totalled 109.312 million shares worth
RM249.630 million while trade on the Second Board amounted to
10.463 million shares worth RM15.814 million.
	   Maybank was the most active counter with 11.60 million shares,
followed by Rekapac with 7.31 million and MBf Land with 5.45
million shares changing hands.

	   MALAYSIAN Helicopter Services Bhd, soon to be known as Naluri
Bhd, expects to reap some RM220 million from the divestment of its
assets to partly cover its borrowings as well as bond repayment.
	   Recently retired executive chairman of MHS Tan Sri Saw Huat Lye,
said the company's immediate plans include downsizing efforts aimed
at reducing its borrowings which currently stand at RM300 million.
	   Some RM120 million from the divestment of its assets will be
used to repay its borrowings while RM100 million will be used for
bond repayment in mid June.
	   ``We have the funds to meet this requirement given our
divestment. So as far as our immediate future is concerned we are
okay,'' Saw told reporters after the company's annual and
extraordinary general meeting yesterday.
	   As part of the plan, the group will dispose of its major asset -
MHS Aviation to DRIR Equities Sdn Bhd - for RM160 million which Saw
expressed will substantially reduce the group's borrowings.
	   Also on the cards is the divestment of Pacific Pleasures Ltd
which has yet to be concluded and is expected to result in
``favourable profits'' of US$5 million (US$1    RM3.92) while the
company has sold a building in Petaling Jaya for RM50 million.
	   Saw also stressed that although the share price on the local
bourse is trading below par (it closed at 53 sen yesterday), the
company's net tangible assets is well above par at RM2.70 and as
such, the shares are under-valued.
	   At a ``very pleasant and short'' meeting yesterday, Saw said the
shareholders had generally appreciated what was being done by the
company to face the difficult times ahead.
	   Of particular concern to shareholders was the issue of
borrowings which has increased substantially particulary given the
high interest rates and tight liquidity environment, he said,
adding that they had approved the name change to Naluri.
	   Meanwhile, Saw said MHS' investment in Air Maldives Ltd and
Royal Air Cambodge Co Ltd (RAC) which is ``not very large'' is
beginning to turn around as both airlines have reduced their
capacity to meet the market demand.
	   ``In fact, Air Maldives has reported its first profitable
quarter,'' said Saw, adding that although the profit chalked up was
about US$100,000, it was a good start.
	   Air Maldives begun operations in November 1994 with a Airbus
A300-B4.
	   Saw said since the airbus was too big, the airline was losing
money.
	   Since then, it has been replaced with a smaller Airbus A320
which is more realistic based on the market size and as such, is
beginning to cover cost.
	   Similarly, RAC - 40 per cent owned by MHS - which started with
two B737s, only operates one now and seems to be faring well
although the political situation in Cambodia still remains
unstable.
	   Meanwhile, newly appointed chairman of MHS Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli
explained the group's repositioning strategy based on the
convergence of technology.
	   He said the new holding company - Naluri Bhd - will be involved
in transportation, tourism and technology, and will undertake to
divest some businesses ``that are not exciting in terms of
profits''.
	   To a question on whether Technology Resources Industries will be
put under MHS, he replied, it will continue to remain under his
personal holdings.
	   Tajudin also declined to respond to any questions pertaining to
Malaysian Airlines System Bhd's restructuring proposal saying the
announcement will be made in a month's time.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian military planes bombed an air
force base outside the Eritrean capital Friday before being shot
down by Eritrean anti-aircraft guns in an escalating border dispute
between two of the world's poorest countries.
	   Two Ethiopian MiG-23 fighter planes on Friday afternoon bombed
two hangars at an air base outside Asmara that is adjacent to the
international airport. A commercial airliner on the tarmac was
reported damaged. Eritrean guns then shot the planes down.
	   Witnesses saw several injured people being transported in
trucks, but it was not immediately possible to determine the number
of wounded or the fate of the Ethiopian pilots.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
the bombing was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on Mekele,
200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis, on Friday that wounded
five Ethiopians.
	   Reliable Ethiopian sources said fighting continued for a third
day Friday around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded
tank, artillery and mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked
Eritrean tanks that were moving toward Adigrat, about 20 kilometers
(10 miles) west.
	   Both armies used aircraft, tanks and artillery supplied to
Ethiopia by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a four-point proposal put forth by the United
States and Rwanda to end the two countries' border conflict
peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was
wearing thin because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from
territory Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   It added that it would never ``acquiesce to the language of
force and intimidation and will, if necessary, resolutely defend
its hard-won right to live in peace and freedom.''
	   Jubilant Eritreans poured into the streets of Asmara waving the
blue, green and red flags of their young nation after the Ethiopian
fighters were shot down.
	   ``They thought they would terrorize the Eritrean people, but it
worked the opposite,'' said Yemane Kifle, a business consultant.
	   The conflict prompted the U.S. State Department to order
nonessential staff out of Eritrea and urge other Americans to
leave. Peace Corp volunteers also were evacuated.
	   In Washington, a State Department official said a plane carrying
122 Americans and 70 other foreigners, mostly Britons and
Canadians, left Eritrea on Friday. The official said the plane was
heading for Frankfurt, Germany, with an intermediate stop in Cairo,
Egypt.
	   The State Department called on Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease all
hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of the
dispute.
	   At the United Nations in New York, U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson said Friday that the United States is ``very concerned''
over the escalation of tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia and
would initiate efforts in the Security Council to deal with the
issue.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.
	   Eritrean rebels under the command of President Isaias Afwerki
were instrumental in helping Meles' Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.

Colombian president offers rights workers ticket to safety
</HEADLINE>
  By JARED KOTLER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Unable to shield Colombia's human rights
workers from threats and violence, President Ernesto Samper is
offering them tickets on the next plane out.
	   A government fund will allow 30 to 40 threatened activists to
live and study abroad until they feel safe returning home, Samper
said.
	   ``If they want to voluntarily go abroad until the circumstances
clear up, I am obliged to find a way to help them,'' the Colombian
leader told The Associated Press in an interview this week.
	   While human rights monitors say the program could provide
relief, some wonder about the president's motives.
	   ``At one level it could be a useful program,'' said Coletta
Youngers of the Washington Office on Latin America. ``But it's
ironic that they're trying to get their critics out of the
country.''
	   Last year, 27 Colombian human rights activists were
assassinated, up from eight in 1996, according to Colombian
Commission of Jurists. Two have been shot dead this year. Death
threats have forced at least three provincial rights organization
to shut down in the past year.
	   Judicial investigators believe right-wing paramilitary groups
and current or former security force members are behind the
violence. One of the activists killed, Jesus Maria Valle Jaramillo,
had accused the army and high-ranking politicians of sponsoring
death squads.
	   Amnesty International's secretary-general, Pierre Sane, last
month called the government's failure to guarantee rights monitors'
safety ``at best gross irresponsibility and at worst criminal
negligence.''
	   The amount of the grant to each activist who decides to leave
will depend on the cost of living in the country of refuge, but
will be ``enough to assure a dignified existence,'' Samper said.
	   Canada, France, Spain and Sweden were among countries that have
indicated a willingness to receive the activists, the president
said. The government is seeking additional money from foreign
governments and private donors to augment the dlrs 550,000 it has
pledged.
	   Human rights groups will take advantage of the scholarships,
said Carlos Rodriguez Mejia of the Colombian Commission of Jurists.
But the best measure of protection would be to arrest and prosecute
those responsible for the attacks on rights defenders, he added.
	   ``What we really want are guarantees that we can live in
Colombia and work here,'' Rodriguez said.
	   Military officers frequently have accused rights groups of links
with leftist guerrillas who have been waging war against the state
for more than 30 years.
	   Last month, prosecutors acting on an army request searched the
Bogota office of a Roman Catholic Church-sponsored rights group,
Justice and Peace. Terrified nuns were forced to their knees by
soldiers in combat gear during the search, which outraged the
international human rights community.
	   Samper, who leaves office in August, is widely blamed for
failing to prevent attacks on rights monitors, creating a climate
of fear under which several leading activists already have fled
Colombia.
	   The government professes to have done its best to protect human
rights workers. Samper has issued decrees recognizing human rights
work as legitimate and instructing public officials to refrain from
statements accusing rights workers of guerrilla ties.
	   Last year, the government created a protection program for
rights activists, offering courses on security as well as
surveillance cameras, police bodyguards and armored cars.
	   Human rights groups have complained that the protection program
is inadequately funded and has drawn bodyguards from same security
forces suspected of involvement in attacks. Samper's office
promises to triple the budget to about dlrs 1.1 million this year,
and select bodyguards from rosters provided by the human rights
groups.

	   THE Government expects to earn RM24 billion from income tax this
year, 29 per cent less than it had earlier projected.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Wong See Wah said the Government
had earlier forecast that the taxes collected by the Inland Revenue
Board (IRB) could reach RM31 billion this year.
	   ``This forecast has been revised to RM24 billion in view of the
economic uncertainties,'' he told reporters after launching the
board's new logo in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Wong said the lower projection would be the result of among
other things, the lower collection of corporate taxes as companies
are not registering good performances during the economic slowdown.
	   The Government has also introduced measures to boost investments
and assist businesses. These include lowering certain taxes or
abolishing them altogether.
	   Wong said all these will have implications to the overall IRB's
tax collections for this year.
	   In his speech earlier, the Deputy Minister said during the
present economic turmoil, the Government places high hopes on the
Inland Revenue Board (IRB) to boost the country's earnings via
direct taxes.
	   He noted that ever since the board was corporatised on March 1,
1996, there have been numerous changes as well as achievements made
by the IRB.
	   Wong said the Government takes pride in the efficient manner of
the board in its tax collection activities since the
corporatisation took place. Last year, the IRB's tax collections
amounted to RM30.47 billion compared with RM25.8 billion in 1996.
	   For the first quarter of this year, the total tax collections
amounted to RM10.33 billion compared with RM9.056 billion in the
corresponding period a year ago. This was an improvement of some 14
per cent.
	   Wong also said the IRB should be strict and yet fair in
implementing the country's regulations tax payments, especially
during the times of economic turmoil.
	   He urged companies to complete their respective financial
statements fast and immediately submit their account statements to
the IRB so that tax assesments can be made.
	   ``For those companies that need to reschedule their income tax
payments, they can contact the board after the tax assessment
notices are issued,''
	   he added.
	   Wong said as of May 31, 232 companies had appealed for a
reschedule in their rspective income tax payments.

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with entire Saturday night card scrapped  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Henry Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B
and was ruled ineligible to fight heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield on Saturday.
	   The finding came in two separate medical tests conducted by the
New York State Athletic Commission, said Greg Fritz, a spokesman
for Don King Productions, the promoter of the fight.
	   ``The fight is off,'' Fritz said Friday.
	   The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
	   Hepatitis B, often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic
needles, can cause serious liver problems. The disease can be
treated successfully, but not always. Hepatitis A is typically a
food-borne disease that can pass quickly.
	   The entire Saturday night card at Madison Square Garden was
scrapped.
	   Heavyweight Ray Mercer, who was to fight on the undercard
against Jerry Ballard, also was suspended for medical reasons, said
Ralph Petrillo, medical coordinator for the athletic commission. He
also said Akinwande was under a medical suspension, but he declined
to elaborate.
	   They were the second and third medical suspension to hit
Saturday's card.
	   On Thursday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because tests
showed she is pregnant.
	   Melissa Salamore was to have replaced Garcia, but Martin
rejected her as an opponent and promoters were trying to find
someone else to replace her.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to his career. He was
disqualified during a bout against WBC champ Lennox Lewis in July
for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was fighting for a piece of the title for the
second time in less than a year was due more to his choice of
promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle, promoter Don
King matched him against Orlin Norris Jr., and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included 46-year-old
Roberto Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard. Duran first fought in the
Garden in 1971, and is 6-1 in his career at the arena.
	   Duran, like Akinwande, hardly earned his title shot, winning a
decision in Panama in his last fight after getting knocked down in
the first round.

	   ACTACORP Holdings Bhd's stand-alone rating has been downgraded
to C2 from BB3 due to its depressed business and financial profile.
Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM) said the new rating also takes
into account the company's financial fundamentals characterised by
high borrowing levels and poor liquidity which have been aggravated
by slower payments from customers and high collection risks. The
rating agency said with the prevailing high interest rates,
Actacorp's operational cashflow can barely service its interest
obligations unless more jobs are secured or fresh capital is
channelled into the group either via an injection of funds from
shareholders or sale of assets.

	   THE Cabinet approved yesterday public transportation fares
between RM6.50 and RM85 (single journey) to the KL International
Airport (KLIA) in Sepang, which is scheduled to be opened later
this month.
	   Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said the
public has a choice of seven types of public transportation to
KLIA.
	   These include a combination of the KTM Komuter and stage buses,
stage buses from the Tun Razak hockey stadium, the bus shuttle
service which includes the semi-luxury and luxury express buses,
Klang Valley taxis and the limousine service which includes the
premier and budget taxis.
	   Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur yesterday after launching
the Small Entrepreneur Service Centre at the National Entrepreneur
Guidance Centre, Mustapa described the fares as ``reasonable''.
	   ``If we look at the fare per km, the fares agreed upon are
reasonable.
	   Furthermore, we have to take into account that prices of new
cars have increased and interest rates for loans to purchase cars
have also increased,'' he said.
	   Giving a comparison, Mustapa said the fare from the city centre
to the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang is
RM25.60, which is RM1.14 per km, while the fare from the city
centre to KLIA is RM0.75 a km.
	   He added that the various companies involved in providing the
public transport to the airport in Sepang will be carrying out
trial runs on June 5 and 6.
	   ``This is to see what are some of the problems that may arise,''
he said, adding that among the problems anticipated are traffic
congestion and the frequency of transport.
	   ``There must be a bus every 15 minutes and the response time for
taxis has to be as minimal as possible.
	   ``The trial run scheduled for the middle of June will be in full
force and there will also be another trial run between three and
four days before the opening of the airport,'' he added.
	   For the option of taking a combination of the KTM Komuter and
stage buses, the minister said users can take the commuter from the
city to the Batang Benar station which is one-stop away from Nilai.
``From Nilai, they then take the stage buses to the airport and the
fare for the combination of the commuter and stage buses is
RM6.50,'' he said.
	   One other option is the stage bus which will depart from the Tun
Razak hockey stadium will cost RM7.70. This bus will make four
stops and will mainly cater to those working at KLIA.
	   ``The semi-luxury express bus fare is RM18 for one way while the
luxury bus fare is RM25,'' he said.
	   The bus shuttle service is overseen by Kuala Lumpur City Bus, a
joint venture led by Intrakota and Parkmay.
	   On the other hand, the metered taxi fare will cost RM46. This
however, does not include the surcharge which is still being
discussed. At present the surcharge imposed by metered taxis to the
is RM3. For the limousine service, the fare for the budget taxis
from the city centre to KLIA is RM55 while from KLIA to the city
centre is RM65, he said.
	   ``The consortium has also agreed to have a return ticket which
will cost RM98 and these return tickets are valid for six months
and are transferable,'' he said.
	   Airport Limo (M) Sdn Bhd, the consortium awarded the KLIA
limousine service, has also agreed to a lower fare for the premier
taxi service, said Mustapa.
	   From KLIA to the city centre, the fare is RM88 while from the
city centre to KLIA is RM66 while the return fare is RM140, he
added.
	   The budget taxi service will see the use of the Proton Wira
while the premier taxi service will use the Mercedes Benz, Proton
Perdana and the Fiat Ulysses, a multi-purpose vehicle.
	   The consortium, he added, will be using Proton Wira (350 units),
Mercedes Benz (150 units), Proton Perdana (200 units) and Fiat
Ulysses (100 units).

Settlers intensify campaign against West Bank troop pullback
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs with comment from Israeli Cabinet
secretary.  
  By KARIN LAUB  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fearing that government approval of a West Bank
troop withdrawal is imminent, Jewish settlers on Friday took senior
members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party on
flights over the disputed land in hopes of scuttling a pullback.
	   Settlers also threatened to establish at least two new Jewish
settlements if Netanyahu accepts a U.S. withdrawal proposal that
would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under Palestinian control
and restrict settlement expansion.
	   As a result of the withdrawal, ``the settlements are turning
into enclaves in Palestinian areas and in our view, this is a
life-and-death battle,'' said settler spokesman Aharon Domb.
	   Under the American plan, Israel would withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over a 12-week period, in exchange for Palestinian
security measures, such as collecting illegal weapons. Negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement would begin with the first pullback.
	   Two senior Palestinian negotiators were to brief Arafat later
Friday on their talks with the U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross.
	   Israel army radio said Ross asked the Palestinians to accept
several changes in the original U.S. proposal, but that report
could not be confirmed. A remaining sticking point is the scope of
an additional pullback promised by Israel.
	   Netanyahu wants assurances now that he will not have to hand
over more than 2 percent at the time, a demand rejected by the
Palestinians.
	   Despite continued disagreements, both Netanyahu and Arafat
seemed mildly optimistic in their assessments. Netanyahu said
Thursday that ``some progress'' had been made, while Arafat said he
was assured by U.S. mediators that a deal would be wrapped up by
mid-June.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dannny Naveh said a deal was likely
soon.
	   ``I hope that we can wrap up a deal in the next few days,''
Naveh told Israel TV.

	   COMPANIES should use electronic commerce (e-commerce) in their
business transactions especially now the country is experiencing an
economic slowdown as its saves not only time but also money,
Electronic Data Interchange Malaysia Sdn Bhd (EDIM) said.
	   Its chief executive officer, Mr Indra Gunawan Alamshah, said the
country is already saving RM100 million a year through the
paperless form of transactions. Contrary to popular belief, EDIM
not only is offering its services to the freighter forwarding
industry at Port Klang but also complements the retail industry.
	   He said large retail stores can better run their businesses by
outsourcing the management of their inventories to companies like
EDIM.
	   ``By enabling us to take care of this aspect of the business for
them they can then focus their efforts on other important areas,
such as marketing, he told Business Times.
	   Indra said this involves the proper management of shelf space
and the smooth running of retailers' inventories.
	   ``With e-commerce, we can track supply of stocks and
automatically order more stock when that particular stock falls
below a certain level. We are connected on-line with the retailers'
suppliers,'' he said, adding that the objective is to manage shelf
space right so as not to over order products which do not move fast
enough.
	   ``Managing shelf space efficiently is the key to businesses
which aim to maximise their turnover.''
	   Jaya Jusco Stores Bhd is already operating the first phase of
its e- commerce system, the ``Jaya Jusco Electronic Retail
Community'', which was developed by EDIM, while Parkson is also
looking into it.
	   Users are already giving favourable feeback to the RM15 system
at Jaya Jusco. They see a vast improvement over the manual
procedures.
	   The system elctronically transmits purchase orders to suppliers
who immediately deliver the goods.
	   E-commerce is a method of doing business over the computer
network.
	   It is estimated that by the year 2,000, the value of trade
carried out using this method will be as much as US$200 billion.
	   By that time, the US expects 25 per cent of its economy to be
conducted that way.
	   On the use of e-commerce in ports, Indra said the procedures in
Customs clearance of goods are very complicated and long.
	   ``It therefore justifies the need for a third party to offer its
services to facilitate the clearance of goods,'' he said, adding
that the company will very much like to expand beyond the Customs
and forwarders, but are unable to do so.
	   ``We tried to use the concession for the ports and Customs as a
stepping stone to expand into other related businesses such as
retail and managing the network services,'' he said.

Germany routs Luxembourg part-timers 7-0 to keep guessing game

  EDS: ADDS quotes, RECASTS in parts, ADDS byline.
  By ROY KAMMERER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Germany's 7-0 victory Friday over
Luxembourg's part-timers will only keep alive the guessing game
surrounding the three-time World Cup champion's likely starters in
France.
	   German coach Berti Vogts challenged several players before the
match to prove they belong among his starting ll. None of them had
problems shining against the overmatched Duchy in the team's final
tuneup before France.
	   ``I'm happy I've got a team where I have two good players for
each position _ it's a long World Cup and we have a lot of
choices,'' said Vogts, who refuses to name his starting lineup.
	   Juergen Klinsmann, fighting for a striker position, drove in a
15th minute header from the edge of the box and midfielder
Christian Ziege erased away some poor performances recently by
scoring in the 85th.
	   Thomas Helmer, who connected from short-range after scooping up
Olaf Thon's long downfield pass, showed a recent knee injury may
not stop the defender from reclaiming his starting job.
	   Midfielder Joerg Heinrich, who recently seemed to have misplayed
himself onto the bank, launched a perfect seventh minute cross that
a sliding Ulf Kirsten blasted in with an outstretched leg.
	   Kirsten, Klinsmann's main rival, added a second goal in the
45th. Oliver Bierhoff proved he's one of the few players with a
lock on a starting role by connecting in the 56th and 72nd _ his
17th goal in 27 caps.
	   Luxembourg's players, with only one full-time professional,
offered little resistance as the Germans strived to display their
best side for Vogts.
	   ``It was a good training session for us, nothing more,''
shrugged Bierhoff. ``For us strikers it was good because we could
fatten our goal total.''
	   On a sweltering night, the Germans had a much easier time with
Luxembourg than Cameroon, another World Cup team, which struggled
to a 2-0 victory Sunday.
	   Germany looked dismal in a scoreless draw against Finland a two
weeks ago, a performance which almost cost several players their
starting jobs. But the team was impressive in a 3-1 victory
Saturday against Colombia.
	   For Vogts, the last two outings are a clear sign the team is
reaching its stride before the June 15 opener against the United
States.
	   ``There were too many loose passes as far as I'm concerned, but
it's getting better and better,'' said Vogts. ``I wanted a clear
improvement over Colombia and I got it.''
	   Luxembourg didn't have a real shot on goal until the 79th minute
when Serge Thill found himself loose in front of Jens Lehmann, but
fired the ball straight into the keeper's hands.
	   As an indication of Luxembourg's near amatuer status, Thill had
been inserted late in the match for Gordon Braun, a forward busy
cramming for college exams.
	   Klinsmann, who outraced the slow Luxembourg defenders, showed he
may have regained his former explosiveness as he and Kirsten
continue their fierce battle to claim the second forward start.
	   Vogts has already called his striker foursome, which also
includes FC Kaiserslautern's Olaf Marschall, the best the German
team has boasted since the 1970 World Cup.
	   But Vogts isn't saying which striker will start along Bierhoff
or who else will surface on top for starting roles.
	   ``The coach has a clear idea of what he wants _ we'll just have
to accept his decisions,'' said libero Lothar Matthaeus.
	   LINEUPS:
	   Germany: Andreas Koepke (Jens Lehmann, 46th minute) , Olaf Thon
(Stefan Reuter 74th), Christian Woerms, Juergen Kohler (Markus
Babbel 46th), Joerg Heinrich, Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Matthaeus
46th), Thomas Helmer (Michael Tarnat 46th), Christian Ziege,
Andreas Moeller (Olaf Marschall 59th), Ulf Kirsten (Oliver Bierhoff
46th) and Juergen Klinsmann.
	   Luxembourg _ Philippe Felgen, Marc Birsen, Frank Deville, Vanek,
Laurent Deville, Dany Theis, Jeff Saibene, Joel Groff, Ralph Ferron
(Luc Holtz 64th) , Manuel Cardoni and Gordon Braun (Serge Thill
59th).

	   MBM Resources Bhd, in the light of the downturn in car sales,
has scaled down its targeted financing on cars this year to RM50
million compared to about RM160 million previously.
	   This was disclosed yesterday by MBM's managing director Datuk
Abdul Rahim Abdul Halim after the company's annual general meeting
in Kuala Lumpur.
	   MBM's wholly-owned subsidiary, DMM Credit Sdn Bhd, gave about
RM80 million in car financing last year.
	   Out of the RM80 million, RM60 million is derived from MBM's
internal resources while the remaining RM20 million finance came
from long term borrowings.
	   According to him, MBM has so far borrowed RM15 million this year
to be used for car financing.
	   He added MBM is still looking for more borrowings this year to
be used for car financing.
	   Daihatsu (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, its 71.5 per cent subsidiary,
contributed the bulk of MBM's profit last year of between 70 per
cent and 80 per cent, Abdul Rahi said.
	   Meanwhile, Abdul Rahim said MBM's first quarter performance in
1998 was affected by the downturn in the motorvehicle industry.
	   ``For the first quarter of this year, MBM just managed to break
even due to lower car sales, profit margin and higher interest
rates.'' ``However, MBM's investment in New Zealand and Australia
is not affected by the current economic downturn,'' Abdul Rahim
said.
	   On MBM's local operations, Abdul Rahim said that it is looking
at consolidating its car business due to current sluggish car
market.

Injured Torrence likely to miss USA and Goodwill 100s
</HEADLINE>
  By BERT ROSENTHAL  
  AP Track Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Gwen Torrence, the world's top-ranked
women's 100-meter runner in 1994 and 1995, probably will miss the
event at the national championships and Goodwill Games because of
an injured left leg.
	   Torrence was hurt about two weeks during a race at Georgia Tech
and has not run during training since then.
	   ``I'm so far behind as far as sprinting goes,'' she said Friday
during a conference call from Atlanta. ``It doesn't look like I'll
be able to run the 100.''
	   Torrence, also the 1995 world champion in the 100 and the 1992
Olympic gold medalist in the 200 meters, said that if she competed
in the USA Championships June 19-21 at New Orleans or the Goodwill
Games at Uniondale, New York, July 19-22, it probably would be in
the 400, in which she was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. in 1992.
	   ``It depends on how my quad heals,'' she said. ``I'm looking
toward the 400 for the European season and the Goodwill Games.
	   ``I want to run something. If I don't think I can run 10.8
(seconds for the 100), I will look toward something else.
	   ``At this stage, I just want to go to the party. I don't know if
I will be able to dance, but I just want to compete.''
	   Torrence, who will be 33 next week, said she her days of
competing in the 200 probably are over, ``because it's too
difficult to train for the 200. It's easier to train for the 400.
To run the 200, you have to train like a quarter-miler.''
	   Last year was the first time since she became an elite runner in
1982 that Torrence did not compete in the 200.
	   The past two years have been injury marred and frustrating for
the highly competitive Torrence.
	   After competing in two indoor races in 1997, she injured her
left hamstring. After recuperating, she was into her second race
outdoors when she was hurt again.
	   ``I had strained my leg badly and I had dislocated something in
my groin and my hip bone,'' Torrence said.
	   She doesn't want surgery on her latest injury, preferring to let
the injury heal by itself.
	   ``If I have to go under the knife, I will have a very early
retirement,'' she said.
	   Torrence said her recovery is ``going well.''
	   ``I can jog, I can do stadium stairs, but when I try to lift
(her leg while running), I have problems,'' she said.
	   At the Goodwill Games, Torrence was supposed to compete in the
100 against 1997 world champion Marion Jones, two-time Olympic
champion Gail Devers and two-time world 200 champion Merlene Ottey
of Jamaica.
	   Most likely, she will have to withdraw.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Tin Market closed eight sen higher at RM22.43
per kg yesterday, aided by the strong close of the three-month tin
on the London Metal Exchange (LME) overnight, dealers said.
	   They said the US$40 gain on the LME has spurred firm buying
interest on the local front.
	   A dealer said that the KLTM's firm trend was also supported by
the bullish sentiment overseas, adding that the metal is
experiencing low stocks position internationally.
	   At the opening level of RM22.35 per kg, bids amounted to 138
tonnes compared to offers of only 90 tonnes.
	   Turnover at the closing bell stood at 90 tonnes as against 101
tonnes on Tuesday, with major players from Europe and locals.
	   The premium between the KLTM and that of the LME was at US$42
from US$2 yesterday.

	   SOUTHERN Bank Bhd yesterday unveiled its fingerprint biometric
Auto Teller Machine (ATM) transaction system, making it the first
commercial bank to introduce a biometric transaction security in
the country.
	   Southern Bank demonstrated the new improved security system,
which was developed in cooperation with Siemens Nixdorf Information
System Sdn Bhd, during a soft launching held in conjunction with
the bank's annual general meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Speaking to reporters after the launching, Siemens Nixdorf
support manager Kathirmathy Retnam said with the introduction of
such fingerprint biometric feature, this will boost the confidence
among users on security of ATM machines.
	   ``The new feature applied to Southern Bank's ATM, provides an
alternative security application to the customers, instead of the
ordinary pin number as it operates at a higher level of security
and prevents theft and fraud,'' he added.
	   ``The fingerprint is the recognised world-wide standard for
identifying individuals as it cannot be forged or transferred,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile, PT Siemens Indonesia software consultant Setyadi
Irawan, who was also present at the launching said research has
proved that 99 per cent of the fingerprint identification is unique
in nature.
	   ``Thus, this biometric system is more secure compared to the
usual use of pin number,'' he added.
	   In fact, Retnam said Southern Bank's customers can register any
one of the 10 fingers, instead of the thumbs alone for the
fingerprint biometric ATM transaction security.

Romario's recovery exceeds expectations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Just days after being cut from
Brazil's national team, Romario surpassed his physical therapist's
expectations and appeared on Brazilian television kicking a soccer
ball around a sand box Friday.
	   ``Romario is much better than I had imagined,'' Nilton Petroni
was quoted in O Globo newspaper. ``He wasn't supposed to go the
sand box today but he felt so good after a work session this
morning that we upped the training schedule.''
	   Petroni's office declined to comment to The Associated Press.
	   Romario returned from France earlier this week after tests
showed he had not recovered sufficiently from a muscle injury in
his leg.
	   On Friday, Romario criticized the decision to cut him from the
team, saying he would have been ready to play when the World Cup
competition starts on June 10.
	   ``Let's hope that in the future these decisions are made
correctly,'' he told Globo News.

	   ROCK Chemical Industries (Malaysia) Bhd expects demand for its
products to be affected due to its reliance on the construction
industry.
	   As a result, Datuk Ahmad Harun in his latest chairman's
statement says he expects the group's profit for the current
financial year to decline.
	   However, for the financial year ended December 31 1997, Rock
Chemical's group pre tax profit improved 19 per cent to RM6.71
million from the previous year's of RM5.64 million while turnover
for the year grew 18 per cent to RM38.9 million from RM33.0 million
previously.
	   After tax profit meanwhile rose 25 per cent to RM5.13 million as
compared to RM4.10 million while earnings per share improved to
19.4 sen from 16.9 sen in 1996.
	   Ahmad Harun said that for the year under review, the group's
white cement sales value increased 6 per cent due to a 3 per cent
increase in sales volume and net selling price as compared to
previous levels.
	   He added that the weakening of the ringgit against major
currencies in the second half of the year, gave the group an
opportunity to derive substantial gains that were realised from the
export of white cement which are priced in foreign currencies.
	   The group's quarry division spearheaded by RCI Resources Sdn Bhd
saw strong demand for its products with the sales value of its
marble blocks increasing by 58 per cent on the back of a 61 per
cent increase in production of the blocks.
	   Ahmad Harun also said that its lime products sales meanwhile
increased 29 per cent while gross profit for the year rose by 13
per cent as compared to the previous year due to the good demand
for the company's lime products.

	   RINGGIT ended higher against the US dollar yesterday as the
greenback came under selling pressure.
	   The local unit ended at 3.9200/300 against the US dollar from
Tuesday's close of 3.9450/550.
	   Dealers said the US dollar's fall against the yen and a steadier
performance on the local stock market has helped the ringgit to
rise.

	   THREE-month KLibor futures ended steadier yesterday but trading
remained lacklustre on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange.
	   Dealers said fundamentally, players were still awaiting for
fresh news on the economic outlook and regional developments.
	   ``The market generally stayed rangebound,'' said a dealer,
adding that KLibor futures would continue to trade sideways to
higher in the near term.
	   On the MME pit, all months traded posted gains of between three

	   Dealers said activity was, however, confined to September 98,
December 98 and March 99.
	   Both September 98 and December 98 ended at 88.83, up three and
eight basis points respectively.
	   Turnover amounted to 98 lots while open interest stood at 3,150
contracts.
	   Meanwhile, on the money market, the KLibor three-month tenure
remained at 11.03 per cent.

What the passengers heard: crash probe focuses on broken wheel
</HEADLINE>
  EDS: UPDATES with two victims dying at hospital, grafs 10-11.
CHANGES number of hospitalized  
  By TONY CZUCZKA  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ The reason for the noise that rattled
some passengers minutes before InterCity Express 884 smashed into a
bridge is now clear: investigators confirmed Friday that a broken
wheel was the most likely cause of derailment and disaster.
	   The damaged wheel was located on the first car behind the
locomotive. Investigators didn't have to go far to find the
fractured steel rim that encircles the wheel, and helps keep the
train on the tracks. It had flown off and was lodged in the bogie,
the set of four wheels at each end of a car.
	   Another clue: A still unidentified piece of the train was found
on the tracks six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the concrete and
steel bridge that the train struck broadside.
	   That piece _ and damage to both the rail and ties nearby _
corroborates passengers' recollections of noise and vibration two
minutes before the derailed train started breaking apart and
crashed into supports of an overpass. At 200 kph (125 mph) the
train would have traveled the distance in less than two minutes.
	   ``There was an uncomfortable rattling and I had the feeling that
maybe something was lying on the tracks,'' Wolf-Ruediger Shliebener
recalled. ``People looked at each other, shocked.''
	   He said it stopped for a second. Then there was a crash.
	   It still isn't clear what knocked down the bridge. A broadcast
report suggested that the fifth car, the last to get past the
falling bridge, had knocked down a support.
	   But federal railway spokesman Jens Boehlke said it was
conceivable that the destabilized first car had struck a support,
and that the deck had not fallen down on the speeding train until
several cars had gotten through. The seven remaining passenger cars
and rear locomotive then jackknifed into each other.
	   More than 1,200 rescuers using jackhammers, cranes and cutting
tools worked around the clock to free survivors the first day, then
increasingly victims as they dug deeper into the tangle of metal
and shattered glass.
	   The 93rd body was recovered Friday under a 10-meter piece of
road that had fallen next to the train, and two more victims died
at hospitals, raising the death toll to 98. Rescue workers said
they could not rule out the possibility that other bodies would be
found until the debris was cleared from the four-track line.
	   By Friday evening, 19 victims had been identified and 55 people
were still hospitalized.
	   The wheel theory has not yet been proven, but is the focus of
investigators' questions. Still unexplained is whether the wheel
broke apart due to metal fatigue, or some outside force.
	   ``We are extremely interested in researching the cause for the
break in the tire, and we will of course go after this with special
intensity,'' authorities said in a statement.
	   Boehlke said that in the seven years the high-speed InterCity
Express trains have been in service, there has been no similar
break or failure in the wheels.
	   An investigation _ being conducted by a special commission of
police, rail and other experts and supervised by prosecutors _ may
take months to complete. It will include interviews of surviving
passengers and rail personnel as well as maintenance workers.
	   The federal railway authority, which sets standards for safety
and service, issued a statement that said sabotage has not been
ruled out. However, no one has produced any evidence that suggests
tampering.
	   ``Any suggestion of the cause of the accident at this point is
speculative,'' the statement said.
	   Joachim Haack, police spokesman at Eschede, said the findings
pointed to a mechanical reason.
	   The crushed train was one of the first generation of high-speed
trains introduced in Germany in 1991. The other 59 trains in that
group were taken out of service Thursday night for emergency
inspections, and half had returned to duty by Friday evening.
	   Steel tires require regular inspection and replacement because
of wear. Typically, a new tire is expanded by heating it red hot,
then it is slipped over the wheel disc and shrinks tightly to fit,
said Richard Gibbon, curator of engineers at the National Railway
Museum in York, England.
	   British high-speed trains may clock 1.5 million miles a year,
but the tires may wear out in 100,000 miles, Gibbon said. Trains in
the United States use a solid wheel with no removable tire, he
added.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Two North African men have been arrested and held
under Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, police said Friday.
	   Scotland Yard said the men were arrested at two addresses in
north London on Friday morning and were being questioned at a
central London police station. Police have not named the men, nor
said where in North Africa they are from.

Annan condemns Serb ``atrocities'' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Yugoslav comment; TRIMS, no pick up  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In an unusually strong statement, U.N.
chief Kofi Annan accused Serb forces of ``atrocities'' in Kosovo
and demanded Friday that ``this kind of aggression'' be confronted
``immediately and with determination.''
	   The Security Council discussed the deteriorating situation in
Kosovo on Friday. More than 250 people have died since March 1 in
escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement.
	   The council president, Ambassador Antonio Monteiro of Portugal,
said the 15 members ``expressed their grave concern'' and called
for the ``immediate cessation'' of violence, especially ``the
excessive use of force'' against civilians.
	   ``We all, I think, share the view that unfortunately, Belgrade
seems to be trying to impose a military solution upon the Kosovo
issue,'' British Ambassador John Weston said.
	   Weston said he expects the council to consider ``additional
measures'' beyond the arms embargo imposed last March on Yugoslavia
to urge a political solution.
	   Annan's statement, read by U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt,
was unusual because it specifically accused Serb forces of
atrocities in a military action within areas which the
international community recognizes as part of the Serbian republic.
	   The United Nations is often reluctant to level such accusations
against sovereign governments for actions within their borders.
	   ``The secretary-general is deeply disturbed by the latest
reports of an intensifying campaign against the unarmed civilian
population in Kosovo,'' Brandt said. ``He reiterates in the
strongest possible terms his condemnation of the atrocities
committed by Serbian military and paramilitary forces.''
	   He said those forces ``must not be allowed to repeat the
campaign of ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate attacks on
civilians that characterized the war in Bosnia.''
	   ``If the world has learned anything from that dire chapter in
history, it is that this kind of aggression must be confronted
immediately and with determination,'' the statement added.
	   Annan said he was ``encouraged by NATO's resolve'' to prevent a
further escalation of the fighting and repeated his call for a
negotiated settlement between Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and the
government in Belgrade.
	   At a news conference, Yugoslavia's acting U.N. ambassador,
Vladislav Jovanovic, said the Serb government, which along with
Montenegro forms the Yugoslav federation, was ``firmly committed''
to a ``serious and productive dialogue'' with Kosovo Albanians.
	   ``But first of all, the terrorist activities and banditry should
cease at once and those from the Albanian side and the outside
world who are ambivalent about terrorism should make a very firm
and very clear statement condemning the terrorism,'' Jovanovic
said.
	   Brandt said U.N. refugee officials in northern Albania report
that the influx of refugees from Kosovo appears to be slowing. He
said 400 people crossed the border into Albania by dawn Friday.
	   Jovanovic claimed the refugees fled to escape ``various threats,
harassment and killings by Albanian terrorists'' of the KLA.

Ruling coalition wins second vote on government reform
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES in top six grafs with second parliament vote approving
plan to reduce number of provinces  
  AP Photo planned  

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ It took 10 hours of negotiations and two
votes Friday for the lower chamber of parliament to endorse a
government plan to reduce the number of Poland's provinces from 49
to 12.
	   In a second ballot on the measure, the 460-member lower house,
or Sejm, voted 246-202 with three abstentions to support one of the
major components of a broad reform program pushed by the
Solidarity-led governing coalition.
	   The figures were roughly reversed from the first ballot, when
some members of the coalition refused to support the plan despite
pressure from government leaders. The chamber also rejected another
proposal to establish 17 provinces.
	   But after numerous recesses and negotiations among coalition
members, the governing bloc managed to muster enough support for
the 12 province measure.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said reducing the number of provinces
to 12 was the best option, while Michal Kulesza, the plan's author,
called the vote ``Poland's success because the most rational
division won.''
	   The bill now goes to the upper chamber, or Senate, for approval
and then needs to be signed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a
former communist who is expected to approve it.
	   Under the reform program, to be introduced Jan. 1, Poland would
shed the remains of its communist-era bureaucratic system to give
local governments more power.
	   But people in cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals have protested the proposed reduction of provinces,
causing discord among their representatives in parliament.
	   While the protesters fear a loss of control over governing
spending in their areas, they support the concept of administrative
reform and the goal of transferring decision-making power from the
central government to provincial and local authorities.
	   The reforms are part of Poland's efforts to transform itself
into a market-oriented, openly democratic society as it prepares to
enter NATO and negotiates for membership in the European Union
after more than four decades of communist rule ended in 1990.

Canadian cancer experts criticize Italian doctor's mehtods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A team of four Canadian doctors has told the
federal government that a controversial Italian cancer therapy
thought by some to be a miracle cure is scientifically unfounded.
	   Dr. Luigi DiBella is ``using the patients as the test
subjects,'' the four doctors said in a report to Canada's health
department that was released Friday.
	   ``This raises a strong ethical issue in the mind of clinical
practitioners in Italian medical circles and amongst our team.''
	   The doctors, who recently visited Italy, were especially
critical of the testing method adopted by the 85-year-old
physiologist, who arrives for a weeklong visit to Toronto on Sunday
to promote his cancer treatment.
	   Their report recommended Canada not introduce the DiBella method
or subject it to clinical trials, warning to do so now would
``engender false and unrealistic hope in patients.''

Refugees intercepted on Turkish-Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Ninety-one refugees trying to enter the
European Union were found late Friday stranded in a field near the
Turkish-Greek border, according to reports.
	   Turkish police arrested 91 illegal immigrants, including many
women and children, outside the northwestern city of Edirne,
private NTV television reported.
	   The group had been abandoned in the field by their smugglers
after crossing Turkey aboard buses. Many of them were thought to be
Iraqi Kurds, the report said.
	   Thousands of foreigners have been rounded up since the beginning
of the year after European nations put pressure on Turkey to impose
stricter control on its coasts and borders to prevent an exodus of
Kurds and other foreigners to Europe.

Grains, soybeans sink on beneficial weather
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFF EDWARDS  
  AP Business Writer  

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Corn futures prices fell Friday to their lowest
in nearly a year on the Chicago Board of Trade, and wheat and
soybeans also retreated, as good weather in major growing areas
kept prices on the defensive amid fears of a supply glut.
	   On other markets, gold futures fell, while copper rose.
	   Rain and moderate temperatures in the Midwest growing regions
were expected to aid what could be bumper corn and soybean crops,
as well as the spring wheat crop. Meanwhile, scorching weather in
Southern growing regions was being alleviated by rainfall, which
was returning moisture to parched crops.
	   U.S. crops in the Midwest so far have grown under ideal
conditions, as evidenced by the U.S. Agriculture Department's
weekly crop ratings. That has led to predictions of record crops at
a time of weak world demand because of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Both Brazil and Argentina also posted record harvests, and
agricultural consultant Safras e Mercado boosted its Brazilian
production estimate to 30.89 million metric tons from 30.37 million
metric tons.
	   Weak futures also were pressured after influential forecasting
firm Sparks Cos. increased its winter wheat production estimate to
1.738 billion bushels from 1.719 billion. That number also is well
above the Agriculture Department's 1.706 billion-bushel estimate.
	   Rains currently were slowing the harvest in Texas and other
states, but dry weather was expected to return early next week.
	   Wheat for July delivery fell 2\ cents to dlrs2.80\ a bushel;
July corn fell 2} cents to dlrs2.37 a bushel, the lowest since
early July 1997; July oats fell 1 cent to dlrs1.29\ a bushel;
November soybeans fell 4{ cents to dlrs5.82{ a bushel.
	   Gold futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
Australian producers sold large quantities of the metal to take
advantage of a stronger U.S. dollar against their local currency.
Prices also were pressured by continued fears the Swiss Central
Bank will sell a large portion of that country's reserves, despite
continued assurances that such a sale would not come for at least a
year.
	   August gold fell dlrs2 to dlrs293.60 an ounce.
	   Copper futures finished modestly higher amid concerns about
intensifying labor troubles in Chile, the world's largest copper
producer. Union members at state-owned Codelco's Radomiro Tomic
mine were scheduled to strike on Monday unless a last-minute
agreement was reached.
	   That would come on top of a continuing work slowdown at
Codelco's massive 650,000 metric ton Chuquicamata mine that was
slowing production. The output cuts were buoying hopes that supply
will not outpace demand this year, as had been feared because of
the Asia crisis has dimmed construction demand.
	   July copper rose .35 cent to 75.85 cents a pound, after rising
as high as 77.60 cents a pound earlier in the session on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.

Bahamas forces back last large group of Cubans, shutting off escape
</HEADLINE>
route  
  By JESSICA ROBERTSON  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas put its last big group of
Cuban refugees on a plane to Havana Friday, acting on a new policy
that closes the last practical escape route for people fleeing the
Communist country on makeshift rafts.
	   Sixty-eight refugees flew home Friday, a senior government
official confirmed on condition of anonymity.
	   ``This is a tragic thing,'' said Jose Basulto, whose Miami-based
organization, Brothers to the Rescue, flies planes to spot Cuban
rafters. ``Now there is no escape for those people who want to
leave Castro behind, and the dictatorship.''
	   Bahamian officials say their new policy is aimed at discouraging
Cubans from using their territory as a way station to the United
States. They cite the expense of housing and feeding hundreds a
year.
	   For the Cuban refugees, the policy is a disaster _ in effect
shutting down their last path to possible freedom.
	   In the 1980s and early 1990s, Cuban boat people who reached the
United States were given automatic asylum because they were fleeing
Fidel Castro's repressive Communist regime.
	   Then came a massive flood in 1994 when Castro, under pressure
from riots in Havana, threatened to drop border controls and swamp
the region with refugees.
	   After some 35,000 Cubans headed across the Straits of Florida,
Washington signed an agreement with Havana to repatriate boat
people in return for Havana allowing 20,000 Cubans a year to
emigrate to the United States.
	   Several Caribbean countries followed the U.S. lead, but without
the proviso forcing Cuba to allow some of its people to emigrate
freely. The Bahamas signed in 1996.
	   That hasn't stopped would-be Cuban emigrants. Almost every week,
rafters propelled by the strong currents of the Windward Passage
land in the Bahamas.
	   Those who didn't qualify for political asylum were routinely
repatriated until December, when Cuba was angered by the
much-publicized defection of baseball star Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez through the Bahamas. He was allowed to go to Costa Rica
and signed a dlrs 6.6 million contract with the New York Yankees.
	   Cuba stopped cooperating with Bahamian officials eager to deport
boat people, and the refugee population in Nassau swelled to more
than 200. Finally, Cuba agreed to cooperate, but apparently only
after the Bahamians promised to send home all boat people.
	   The Bahamas, meanwhile, rejected an offer from Nicaragua to give
asylum to all its Cuban refugees. To accept ``would be opening the
floodgates for more to come,'' Foreign Ministry official Luther
Smith said.
	   Undaunted, the Cuban boat people continue their attempts,
although some have been sent home three and four times.
	   ``I will just save up and buy a new boat,'' Javier Villalobos, a
26-year-old doctor from Havana, said through the fence of the
Bahamian detention camp.

Richardson says US will raise Eritrea-Ethiopia crisis in Security
</HEADLINE>
Council  
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Annan appeal  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed
Friday to Ethiopia and Eritrea to ``give diplomacy a chance'' to
resolve their border dispute, and the U.S. ambassador said he would
raise the issue in the Security Council.
	   The statements were issued after Eritrean anti-aircraft guns
shot down two Ethiopian attack planes that bombed an Eritrean air
force base Friday, a day after Ethiopia's premier agreed to a peace
proposal for their disputed border.
	   No details were immediately available on casualties.
	   In a statement, the United Nations noted that the attack came
despite apparent progress by American and Rwandan mediators in
attempting to resolve a border dispute between the two African
countries.
	   ``The secretary-general strongly appeals to both sides for an
immediate cessation of hostilities so as to give diplomacy a chance
to bridge the remaining differences and avoid any further
escalation,'' the U.N. statement said.
	   It said Annan ``will continue to do everything he can to help
the parties find a peaceful solution to the dispute.''
	   Richardson said the United States, which had been playing a key
mediation role, ``is seriously concerned about the recent
escalation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The situation is getting
very serious.''
	   Richardson said the United States supports mediation efforts by
the Organization of African Unity and ``we call on both sides to
start talking with each other.''
	   ``We will initiate efforts in the Security Council to deal with
this issue,'' he added without details.
	   The air raid came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi warned that his country's patience was wearing thin because
of Asmara's refusal to withdraw from territory Ethiopia claims it
occupied a month ago.
	   On Thursday, Meles announced acceptance of a four-point proposal
by the United States and Rwanda to end a festering border conflict
peacefully. One of the recommendations was that Eritrea withdraw to
positions held before May 6.
	   Shortly before the bombing, the government of Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki issued a statement expressing ``its firm commitment
to a peaceful resolution of the crisis'' but it would never
``acquiesce to the language of force and intimidation and will, if
necessary, resolutely defend its hard-won right to live in peace
and freedom.''

Bailey wins 100-meter; George wins but fails to better record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ World 100-meter record holder Donavan Bailey
won the event at a night meet here Friday, just days after
announcing plans to retire following the 2000 Olympics.
	   The 30-year-old Canadian crossed the finishline at the
``Notturna'' outdoor meet in 10.16 seconds, well below his world
mark of 9.84.
	   Bailey, who said prior to the meet he aimed to go under 10
seconds, is still recovering from a recent injury to his Achilles
tendon.
	   He said his main objective before retiring is to clinch the
world title at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   Emma George of Australia claimed the women's pole vault event
but failed to better her world mark of 4.59 meters. She cleared
4.41 meters to finish ahead of American Stacy Dragila who vaulted
4.36.
	   George has broken the world pole vault record 15 times,
including both indoor and outdoor records.
	   Daniel Komen also failed in his quest to set a new world record
in the 2,000-meter. The Kenyan was less than four seconds behind
Algerian Noureddine Morceli's record of 4 minutes 47.88 seconds,
set in 1995.
	   Britain's Colin Jackson, Olympic champion and world record
holder in the 110-meter hurdles, was fastest again here in 13.18
seconds, 27 hundredths slower than his world mark.

East German swimmer to return Olympic medal due to doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German swimmer plans to return her
Olympic bronze medal because of the massive doping that took place
in the former communist country, her lawyer said Friday.
	   Christiane Knacke-Sommer's return of the medal she captured in
the 100-meter butterfly at the 1980 Moscow Olympics will be
followed by several other athletes, according to Michael Lehner.
	   Knacke-Sommer is a co-plaintiff in an ongoing trial of former
East German coaches and doctors.
	   The six defendants are accused of giving 19 young female
athletes anabolic steroids that damaged their hormonal growth and
health as part of communist East Germany's push to create world
champions.
	   Carola Nitschke-Beraktschjan, a former world record holder in
the 100 meter breaststroke, asked for her name to be scratched from
the record book two days ago and offered to return her medals.
	   Lehner also said Heidi Krieger _ now named Andreas Krieger after
a sex change operation _ plans to return a medal. The former
athlete won gold in the shotput at the 1986 World Championships.
	   Several American athletes have called for the former East German
athletes to be stripped of their medals, believing they lost in
unfair competition at the Olympics.

Suspected Mexican cartel leaders deny drug involvement
</HEADLINE>
  By ISAAC GUZMAN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Two brothers accused of heading a
large drug cartel have been charged with money laundering and
criminal association. But their lawyer said Friday prosecutors
haven't charged them with drug trafficking because they have no
proof.
	   ``There is no evidence against my clients,'' Everardo Rojas
Contreras said in an interview at the maximum-security Puente
Grande prison in Guadalajara, 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest
of Mexico City.
	   During a five-hour arraignment of Luis and Jesus Amezcua
Contreras on Thursday, prosecutors offered only newspaper accounts
alleging the brothers' involvement in trafficking.
	   ``If a newspaper says we send drugs to Thailand or Russia, that
is the truth for the government,'' Luis Amezcua said satirically,
according to the newspaper Reforma.
	   Rojas accused Mexico's attorney general's office of bringing the
charges only in order to placate the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
	   Judge Jose Nieves Luna said there was ``a lack of precision'' in
the government's presentation, but that it was sufficient under law
to keep the brothers in jail until Saturday, when the judge must
decide whether to hold them over for trial.
	   Rojas said he was confident the brothers would be freed then.
	   U.S. officials say the Amezcua Contreras gang is the largest
Mexican drug organization supplying illegal amphetamines to the
United States, and that it supplies chemicals to other gangs that
do smaller business in methamphetamines.
	   The third brother accused of leading the gang, Adan, was
arrested Nov. 10, and allegedly confessed and implicated his
brothers. The lawyer said Adan Amezcua was tortured to extract his
confession.
	   In announcing the arrest of the other two brothers on Tuesday,
the attorney general's office said it had broken up ``Mexico's
largest methamphetamine and amphetamine trafficking cartel.''
	   But at the hearing, prosecutors focused on money laundering,
saying the brothers had 125 small businesses, farms and other
properties and had not paid full taxes due on their income.
	   The brothers, based in the western state of Colima, declared
themselves innocent. They said that they inherited most of their
properties from their father or grandfather and that their family
had sold some of those on the government's list 15 years ago.

A closer look at the wheel that broke
</HEADLINE>
  RETRANSMITTING to fix category code  
  By The Associated Press  

<TEXT>
	   Investigators confirmed Friday that wheel failure was the focus
of their probe into Wednesday's high-speed train crash.
	   CONSTRUCTION:
	   A shock-absorbing rubber ring encases a steel disc, the actual
wheel. The entire construction is encircled by a reinforced steel
tire. The tire also functions as a rim that helps keep the wheels
on the track.
	   The wheel system, or bogie, is comprised of four wheels and
brake discs and is located at each end of a car.
	   Each ICE train rides on 80 to 100 wheels, depending on the
number of cars, with eight wheels per carriage.
	   WHAT INVESTIGATORS KNOW:
	   A stray strip of steel, identified as part of the tire, was
found wedged in the bogie. Damaged ties and a switchbox six
kilometers (3.7 miles) from the accident suggest this is where the
tire broke apart. Unidentified pieces of the train were found at
the site.
	   Investigators theorize that the train derailed 300 meters (985
feet) before reaching the overpass.
	   WHO MAKES THE WHEELS:
	   The Hamburg-based company Bochum produced the wheels and bogies
for the 60 first-generation InterCity Express high-speed trains.
Bochum spokesman Goetz-Peter Blumbach said a faulty wheel on an ICE
would be unprecedented.
	   The bogie system was designed especially for Germany's InterCity
Express, and is not used on any other trains. However, other trains
in Europe use the wheel design.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Marc Overmars led the Netherlands
to a crushing 5-1 victory over Nigeria Friday, scoring one goal and
setting up two as the Dutch tore apart the Olympic champion down
both flanks.
	   It was both teams' last tune-up before the World Cup finals
which begin June 10 in France.
	   The Netherlands dominated the match, playing a fluent and fast
passing game that cracked open Nigeria's defense and left the
African side little chance to build up attacks.
	   ``We created chances and we scored chances, but still we gave a
few chances away,'' said Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.
	   ``All in all there was a great feeling in the stadium, but we
still want to cut out sloppy mistakes.''
	   But he said the Dutch team would head for France ``greatly
encouraged'' by its warm-up campaign.
	   After a disappointing 0-0 draw with Cameroon, the Dutch beat
Paraguay 5-1 Monday before repeating that score Friday.
	   Speedy left, 4th graf pvs.

Longtime U.S. sports columnist Shirley Povich dies at 92
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS KIKER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America's capital awoke Friday for the last
time to one of its longest running pleasures: a Shirley Povich
baseball column gracing the sports pages of The Washington Post.
	   It was vintage Povich, ruminating about baseball's past and
present in grand style and skewering a fellow columnist's
suggestion that Mark McGwire's recent feats outshine those of Babe
Ruth.
	   ``Whoa there. Give McGwire the last four years ... but don't
confuse him with the guy who inspired such sobriquets as the Sultan
of Swat and the King of Clout,'' the 92-year-old columnist said in
the column he wrote Wednesday from home after a six-week absence
due to illness.
	   Povich died of a heart attack Thursday evening. The news of his
death ran prominently on the Post's front page, and the final
column, bordered in black, filled nearly half a page in the sports
section.
	   Alongside ran a tribute from Tom Boswell, the Post columnist
that Povich had disagreed with.
	   ``It's about baseball. His first love. In it, he needles me.
Mark McGwire comparable to Babe Ruth? Such apostasy cannot be
allowed to stand!'' wrote Boswell. ``Perfect. Shirley Povich died
setting the record straight.''
	   Povich wrote more than 15,000 columns in seven decades with the
Post. His column, ``This Morning,'' ran six days a week from 1926
to 1974. His insights and opinions on sports, most particularly his
two true loves _ baseball and boxing _ kept generations of
Washingtonians turning to the sports section first thing in the
morning.
	   ``Shirley Povich was why people bought the paper,'' said Ben
Bradlee, retired executive editor of the Post. ``You got the Post
for Shirley and the sports section. He was the sports section. For
a lot of years, he carried the paper, and that's no exaggeration.''
	   Povich, a member of the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of
Fame and the father of TV personality Maury Povich, became the
youngest sports editor in the country in 1926 at age 20. His
columns could make Post readers fume in anger or double over in
laughter.
	   Povich was never afraid to criticize the Washington sports
establishment, even when he had become a part of it. In the 1950s,
Povich blasted Redskins owner George Preston Marshall for refusing
to integrate the Redskins, the last whites-only team in the
National Football League.
	   Povich ``retired'' in 1974 and slowed his pace a bit _ only
writing 50 columns a year.
	   ``I retired, and I've been behind in my work ever since,''
Povich told The Associated Press last year. ``All I can say is
that, for me, it's been a joyride. I really have been blessed.''
	   In 1983, he received the Red Smith Award from the Associated
Press Sports Editors organization for his outstanding contribution
to sports journalism.

warm-up  

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Nigerian soccer federation
Friday considered pulling its national team out of a match with the
Netherlands because of protests at Nigeria's human rights record,
the Dutch soccer association said.
	   The match at Amsterdam's Arena stadium, went ahead and the
Netherlands thrashed Nigeria 5-1.
	   Nigerian officials were enraged by an advertisement in the match
program featuring pictures of 12 prominent Nigerian activists who
have been imprisoned or harassed by the country's rulers.
	   The 12 activists made up an ``alternative Nigerian team,''
organizers of the protest said. The advertisement was placed by a
group of Dutch human rights groups, trade unions and religious
bodies.
	   Nigerian coach Bora Milutinovic also complained about the
full-page announcement in the program.
	   ``I thought the Netherlands was a land of culture ... but this
program is being used for political questions,'' Milutinovic said
after the match.

World Cup: Netherlands crushes Nigeria 5-1 in warmup
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: Repeating to some points  
  By MIKE CORDER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Marc Overmars led the Netherlands
to a crushing 5-1 victory over Nigeria on Friday, scoring one goal
and setting up two as the Dutch tore apart the Olympic champion
down both flanks.
	   It was both teams' last tune-up before the World Cup which begin
June 10 in France.
	   The Netherlands dominated the match, playing a fluent and fast
passing game that cracked open Nigeria's defense and left the
African side little chance to build up attacks.
	   ``We created chances and we scored chances, but still we gave a
few chances away,'' said Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.
	   ``All in all there was a great feeling in the stadium, but we
still want to cut out sloppy mistakes.''
	   But he said the Dutch team would head for France ``greatly
encouraged'' by its warm-up campaign.
	   After a disappointing 0-0 draw with Cameroon, the Dutch beat
Paraguay 5-1 Monday before repeating that score Friday.
	   Speedy left winger Overmars tormented Nigeria with explosive
bursts of pace down the flank.
	   Inevitably, it was Overmars who tore away from his marker and
crossed to set up the Netherlands' opening goal. Striker Patrick
Kluivert was muscled off the ball but Leeds United marksman Jimmy
Hasselbaink was on hand at the far post to slam a shot high into
Nigeria's net in the 32nd minute.
	   Minutes earlier, the Dutch nearly capped a slick passing move
with a goal but Hasselbaink's shot was saved by Nigerian goalkeeper
Peter Rufai.
	   Nigeria almost replied immediately as Victor Ikpeba cut inside
Jaap Stam to create room for a shot but could only blast over the
bar.
	   The Dutch took a deserved 2-0 lead in the 38th minute through
dangerman Overmars. Latching onto a long pass out of defense,
Overmars saw Rufai rushing off his line and deftly lobbed the ball
into the net.
	   Shortly after the break Hasselbaink nearly netted his second
goal and the Netherlands' third when a diagonal pass from Kluivert
left him with only substitute goalkeeper William Okpara to beat.
Hasselbaink delayed his shot until Okpara dived, but Okpara managed
to stick out a hand and deflect the shot wide.
	   But the Netherlands stretched its lead on the hour through
Kluivert _ again following an Overmars cross from the left.
	   Nigeria reduced the lead in the 64th minute, Nwankwo Kanu
shooting a penalty past his former Ajax teammate Edwin van der Sar
after Winston Bogarde had fouled Daniel Amokachi.
	   The goal spurred Nigeria on and first defender Taribo West saw a
shot deflected to safety and then Kanu badly sliced a shot after
being released by Amokachi.
	   But the Netherlands stretched ahead again in the 74th minute
from a fast break with Clarence Seedorf crossing from the right and
Kluivert lashing in his second goal from close range.
	   Substitute Pierre van Hooijdonk made it 5-1 in the 77th minute,
guiding in a cross from Overmars' replacement Boudewijn Zenden.
	   The Netherlands takes on South Korea, Belgium and Mexico in
qualifying Group E while Nigeria plays Spain, Bulgaria and Paraguay
in Group D.
	   Lineups:
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar, Jaap Stam (Winston Bogarde, 45),
Frank de Boer, Arthur Numan, Ronald de Boer (Wim Jonk, 45), Patrick
Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf, Phillip Cocu (Edgar Davids, 45), Marc
Overmars (Boudewijn Zenden, 75), Aron Winter, Jimmy Hasselbaink
(Pierre van Hooijdonk, 75).
	   Nigeria:
	   Peter Rufai (William Okpara, 45), Jero Shakpoke (Augustine
Eguavoen, 21, Austin Okacha 45), Uche Okechukwu, Taribo West,
Celestine Babayaro, Godwin Okpara, Sunday Oliseh, Finidi George
(Tijani Babangida, 45), Nwankwo Kanu (Wilson Oruma, 81), Victor
Ikpeba (Daniel Amokachi, 45), Garba Lawal.

Gough ruled out of the test with a broken finger
</HEADLINE>

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Darren Gough, will play no further
part in England push victory in the first test against South Africa
after x-rays confirmed a broken index finger in his bowling hand
Friday.
	   Gough, batting at No.10, was hit by fast bowler Allan Donald in
fading light, during a stubborn last wicket stand with Angus Fraser
in England's first innings 462.
	   Gough, a medium paceman, carried hopes of England's victory in
the first of the five tests, forming a three-man pace attack with
Fraser and Dominic Cork.
	   Gough, was rushed to the nearby Queen Elizabeth hospital in
Edgbaston after the second day's play, and specialists confirmed
the break.
	   England's team physiotherapist Wayne Morton, who twice treated
Gough on the field, said, ``He will be out for a period of three to
four weeks at which point we will review his availability for
selection for England.''
	   Gough's England career has been plagued by injuries for the past
three years ever since he was forced to fly home from the Ashes
tour in 1995 having broken a bone in his foot.
	   The current Test against South Africa was his first since he
played against Australia at Headingley in July 1997.
	   ``The injury is a bitter disappointment as this is my comeback
Test after a nine-month layoff,'' Gough said.
	   ``It is enormously frustrating both personally and for the team
as we are in a good position but I am confident the rest of the
lads can help us take advantage of a promising situation.
	   Alec Stewart, leading England since taking over from Mike
Atherton said: ``It is tough luck on Darren and the team but
luckily we have still got enough top quality bowlers to do the job
required.''

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Blowing horns and whistles,
waving flags and banners, thousands of fans streamed towards Kosevo
stadium Friday for the final of Bosnia's soccer championship.
	   The duel featured eternal rivals Zeljeznicar and Sarajevo _ but
the real prize was something Bosnia's disunited soccer teams have
not known: a ticket to the European Championship League for the
winner.
	   ``This may not be a World Cup match, but it is incredibly
important for the Bosnian football,'' said Liam McDowall, a U.N.
spokesman.
	   Almost all of the 40,000 tickets were sold out in a match that
served as a final preparation for monitoring the World Cup from
armchairs in front of TV screens. Zeljeznicar won 1-0, bringing
tears _ of joy or disappointment - from both teams and five minutes
of glorious fireworks after the match
	   Neighboring Yugoslavia and Croatia are competing in France, but
Bosnia's soccer has been as disunited as the country itself and the
national team had no chance of qualifying.
	   This year, for the first time since war erupted in 1992, soccer
teams from Bosnian Croat- and Muslim-dominated regions competed for
the national championship. Four from the Muslim regions and two
Croat sides competed in two groups.
	   Claiming security concerns, teams from the Bosnian Serb substate
_ Republika Srpska _ refused to participate. But everybody expects
them aboard in the next season.
	   It has taken three years for international sports organizations
and foreign diplomats charged with implementing peace to negotiate
a solution for Bosnia's disunited sports.
	   The 4-2 Muslim-Croat combination was also adopted for this
year's Bosnian basketball championships _ which the Serbs are also
expected to join in 1999. The Croat side Siroki Brijeg defeated
Sarajevo's Bosna, former European champions, for the local
basketball crown.
	   In recent weeks, the two groups in soccer played in Sarajevo and
the tense southwestern town of Mostar. Hundreds of fans traveled
back and forth without incident _ to the delight of Western
diplomats still trying to overcome ethnic tensions.
	   ``Even a year ago ... it would have been very difficult to
imagine such games take place in Mostar without any trouble,'' said
Martin Garrod, senior international official in Mostar.
	   Fearing ethnic riots, U.N. police closely monitored each game.
	   Fans simply wanted to see the best players.
	   ``There was the war, but it's over now,'' said Sead Beric, a
Zeljeznicar fan, heading for the stadium. ``Now, without all good
players, whether they are Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Jews,
Eskimos or others, we cannot hope to become something in world
soccer and participate in the next World Cup.''

Five fetuses wash up on Brazil beach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A beach cleaner made a grisly
discovery while making his early morning rounds Friday: five dead
fetuses washed up in the surf.
	   Natalino Cardoso Souza found the fetuses, wrapped in plastic
bags, on Bica beach on Rio's northside near the international
airport.
	   Police suspect the fetuses, four male and one female, were
dumped by a clandestine abortion clinic. Police were investigating.
	   ``It wouldn't be very intelligent for those responsible to leave
the fetuses close by,'' Rio de Janeiro policeman Eduardo Morreira
said.
	   Currents carry garbage thrown into Rio's rivers _ everything
from plastic bottles to furniture _ across the heavily polluted
Guanabara Bay to Bica beach.
	   Abortion is illegal in Brazil under a 1945 law, except in cases
of rape or when a woman's life is endangered.

northwestern Poland, the defense ministry said.
	   The accident occurred at a military range near Drawsko
Pomorskie, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Warsaw.
During an exercise of the Scottish Regiment, an armored personnel
carrier pulled back and hit soldiers passing behind it, Eugeniusz
Mleczak, a spokesman for the defense ministry spokesman, told the
PAP news agency.

Akinwande-Holyfield fight called off
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: UPDATES with press conference  
  By TIM DAHLBERG  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield never really wanted to fight
Henry Akinwande. Now he won't have to.
	   The heavyweight title fight was called off Friday, a day before
the bout, because Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B. A
doctor said Akinwande was infectious and that his sparring partners
should also be tested for the disease.
	   ``I guess I'm the guy things happen to,'' said Holyfield, who
was informed the fight was off when he arrived at Madison Square
Garden for his final pre-fight workout. Holyfield went back to his
hotel in hopes he would get a last-minute opponent, but the entire
card was canceled a few hours later.
	   ``Seems kind of strange to wait to the last minute,'' Holyfield
said. ``But I'm already in shape. If you don't fight, you don't get
paid either.''
	   Promoters officially said the fight was postponed indefinitely,
and held out hope that a second set of tests conducted Friday could
prove the first tests wrong and the fight could be rescheduled
within a month or so.
	   But if the tests simply confirm the earlier results _ which
experts say are rarely wrong _ doctors said Akinwande could be
infectious for several more months. Since Holyfield was fighting
Akinwande only because it was a mandatory WBA title defense, it was
unlikely he would get another title chance.
	   ``It (the test) doesn't tell how he got it or how long he'll
have it for,'' said Dr. Donald Kaminsky of the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine. ``It's very unpredictable.''
	   Akinwande was tested on Tuesday, and the New York State Athletic
Commission said it got the results Friday morning. Ticket sales had
been poor, but picked up in the last two days and promoters said
that had nothing to do with the fight being called off.
	   Earlier, a woman boxer was pulled off the card because she was
21 weeks pregnant, and veteran heavyweight Ray Mercer was also
declared medically ineligible.
	   ``It's just one of those things. There's nothing else I can
say,'' promoter Don King said. ``I'm just very sorry for Henry
Akinwande to lose this opportunity to fight for the crown at this
time.''
	   Akinwande, after undergoing a second set of tests Friday,
prepared to leave for Detroit to see a doctor there. He did not
appear for the press conference held to formally call off the
fight.
	   ``He's really sorry he can't fight,'' Akinwande's manager, Jean
Courreges, said. ``He looks to fight Evander again as soon as his
physical condition allows him.''
	   Kaminsky said hepatitis B can be contracted through exchange of
bodily fluids, blood, sexual activity or something such as a shared
toothbrush. He said there are 300,000 new cases of the disease in
the United States a year and that it is epidemic in certain parts
of Africa.
	   Kaminsky said the acute form of the disease runs its course in
several weeks, but can become chronic in a small percentage of the
population. He recommended that Akinwande's sparring partners also
be tested.
	   Akinwande, who was born in England but grew up in Nigeria, now
fights out of Orlando, Florida.
	   ``It's disappointing,'' said Holyfield, who had made no secret
of his lack of desire to fight the WBA's No. 1 contender. ``You
prepare yourself for 13 weeks and then this happens.''
	   Hepatitis B can cause serious liver problems. The disease can be
treated successfully, but not always. Hepatitis A is typically a
food-borne disease that can pass quickly.
	   The fight was supposed to top a card that included 46-year-old
Roberto Duran fighting for a title nine years after he lost his
middleweight crown to Sugar Ray Leonard.
	   On Thursday, Mexican lightweight Maria de las Nieves Garcia was
scratched from her undercard bout with Christy Martin because she's
pregnant. Promoters found Melissa Salamore to replace her and she
was then replaced by Cheryl Nance after Martin rejected Salamore.
	   Mercer was dropped because he also failed a blood test for
undisclosed reasons.
	   The Akinwande decision is yet another blow to a once promising
career. He was disqualified in the fifth round of a fight last July
against WBC champ Lennox Lewis for repeated holding.
	   That Akinwande was even supposed to fight for a piece of the
title for the second time in less than a year was due more to his
choice of promoter than anything else. After the Lewis debacle,
King matched him against Orlin Norris Jr. and Akinwande won a
12-round decision to become the mandatory contender.
	   Akinwande was to make dlrs 2.5 million to fight Holyfield, who
was to get dlrs 10 million for the defense of the WBA title he won
in his first fight with Mike Tyson.

Council  
  Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Security Council calling for an immediate
ceasefire in conflict

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council called Friday for an
immediate cease-fire between Ethiopia and Eritrea following an air
raid, and Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to both parties to
``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   At the request of the United States, the 15-member council met
Friday afternoon to discuss the border conflict between the two
African nations, which escalated Friday after Eritrean
anti-aircraft guns shot down two Ethiopian attack planes that
bombed an Eritrean air force base.
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   In a separate statement, the United Nations noted that the
attack came despite apparent progress by American and Rwandan
mediators in attempting to resolve a border dispute between the two
African countries.
	   ``The secretary-general strongly appeals to both sides for an
immediate cessation of hostilities so as to give diplomacy a chance
to bridge the remaining differences and avoid any further
escalation,'' the U.N. statement said.
	   It said Annan ``will continue to do everything he can to help
the parties find a peaceful solution to the dispute.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said the United States, which
had been playing a key mediation role, ``is seriously concerned
about the recent escalation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The
situation is getting very serious.''
	   Richardson said the United States supports mediation efforts by
the Organization of African Unity and ``we call on both sides to
start talking with each other.''

More woes for Villeneuve in Montreal
</HEADLINE>
  By KEN BERGER  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Jacques-mania has gripped Quebec. There are
flags that say Jacques, voices that shriek ``Jacques!'' and
headlines that scream about Jacques' love life.
	   All the attention has done nothing to change Jacques
Villeneuve's luck.
	   Seeking to turn around a dreadful Formula One season in his
hometown race, Villeneuve failed to finish the practice session
Friday for the Canadian Grand Prix.
	   As his Williams FW20 was pushed off the course named for his
father, Villeneuve walked back to the garage waving his arms and
shouting. He wanted desperately to prove this weekend that he is
still what his loyal fans say he is _ ``champion du monde.''
	   The weekend couldn't have gotten off to a worse start.
	   ``It just cut off, so I quickly took it to the side,'' said the
Canadian-born Villeneuve, whose car coasted to a stop when the
hydraulics failed about halfway through the afternoon practice
session. ``It started very well in the morning, but then the few
changes we made were the wrong ones.''
	   Michael Schumacher's Ferrari gave the McLarens something to
think about, recording the second-fastest practice lap of 124.342
mph (198.947 kmph) on the 12-turn, 2.75-mile (4.4-kilometer) road
course.
	   Points leader Mika Hakkinen was fastest at 124.945 mph (199.912
kmph) in a McLaren Mercedes, followed by Sauber's Jean Alesi
123.950 mph () and Hakkinen's teammate, David Coulthard 123.851 mph
(198.162 kmph).
	   ``We are where I hoped we would be,'' Schumacher said.
	   Villeneuve, the defending series champion, was 16th at 121.907
mph (195.051 kmph) on the best of his 26 laps. He missed the final
40 minutes of practice, a devastating setback for a team that
needed time to figure out the setup for its new rear design before
Saturday's qualifying.
	   ``Those 40 minutes are lost,'' said Villeneuve, winless in eight
races and sixth in the point standings. ``I'd expect our car to be
more competitive than that.''
	   Villeneuve had barely heated the tires on Circuit Gilles
Villeneuve when he had to pull into the pits for adjustments.
Lifting his visor, he revealed a piercing glare that spoke volumes
about restlessness and frustration. He wanted to be staring at
pavement, not pit workers.
	   ``It is very frustrating,'' Villeneuve said. ``We just have to
catch up, that's all.''
	   In addition to broken hydraulics, Villeneuve had to answer
questions about paparazzi photos published in a tabloid Friday _
another testament to his enormous fame here. They showed him with
two women on a boat, beneath blue skies and the headline, ``Between
races, time for love.''
	   A separate article speculated about Villeneuve's love life.
	   ``It is very frustrating that you can't do anything that anybody
would do on a normal day,'' Villeneuve said. ``There's nothing that
needs to be caught. I don't have a girlfriend at this point,
anyway.''
	   The adulation is dual-edged. Critics have seized on everything
from his peroxide-dyed hair to his aloof nature and often untamed
opinions.
	   But he had returned to Canada optimistic, and in much better
spirits than last year. That's when Formula One officials made him
fly to Paris in the days before the race to be reprimanded for
criticizing safety measures.
	   Jet-lagged and throttled by the controversy, Villeneuve crashed
on the second lap.
	   ``I had good training last year, so this year can only be
easier,'' he said.
	   Taking issue with safety rules implemented after the tragic
death of Ayrton Senna in 1994 was shocking for a driver still
coping with his father's death. Gilles Villeneuve was killed during
practice for the Belgian Grand Prix in 1982.
	   Only 27, Villeneuve speaks matter-of-factly of danger and
mortality. Hands clasped, lips shaped in neither smile nor frown,
he constantly seems to be wrestling with weighty issues.
	   Villeneuve on death: ``My father was never world champion. He
died too soon.''
	   Villeneuve on fame: ``Since I've been famous, many people want
to be my friends. I never know if they really like me for who I
am.''

Cartoonist says he stopped 1967 Israeli attempt to deport Arabs
</HEADLINE>
  By DAFNA LINZER  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Syndicated cartoonist Ranan Lurie, a major in
the Israeli army during the 1967 Mideast War, said Friday that he
persuaded then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to stop generals from
expelling thousands of West Bank Palestinians to Jordan.
	   Historians lent credence to his claims and said that while there
was no government expulsion policy, several commanders tried to
force Palestinians out during the chaos of the six-day war.
	   Lurie, who served as a field commander, said he refused to carry
out orders by superiors to load Arab families onto buses and send
them across the Jordan River. Instead, he appealed to Eshkol, a
friend.
	   ``I told Eshkol, 'We are doing something very bad here and it
will affect our children and grandchildren. You can't uproot people
who have lived here for 2,000 years and dump them,''' Lurie said in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press from his Manhattan
home.
	   Meir Pa'il, an Israeli military historian and former lawmaker,
said Lurie's story is consistent with events known to have taken
place elsewhere in the West Bank. ``It wasn't government policy to
expel anyone but there were generals who want it done,'' he said.
	   Lurie, whose account was first published Friday in the Israeli
daily Ha'aretz, said that when he saw Arab families in the West
Bank village of Anabta being ordered on to buses bound for Jordan,
he told a fellow officer, Shlomo Gonen, that ``I couldn't go
through with this. ...This wasn't about combat, but about women and
children.''
	   Lurie said Gonen volunteered to oversee the expulsion.
	   Asked about Lurie's claims, Gonen refused to comment and accused
the cartoonist of trying to paint a better picture of his past in
order to boost his syndication.
	   Lurie said Eshkol blamed his defense minister, Gen. Moshe Dayan,
for the expulsions, and that the prime minister later thanked Lurie
for raising the issue with him.
	   Pa'il, the historian, said Palestinians were being rounded up in
the city of Qalqilya and deported. But on the fourth day of
fighting, Pa'il said an order came in to halt deportations and
allow those forced out to return.
	   ``I don't know why,'' he said.
	   Lurie believes his conversation with a friend and prime minister
was the reason.
	   Lurie was born in Port Said, Egypt, before his family migrated
to Israel. He moved to the United States in 1968. His cartoons
appear in 1,100 newspapers worldwide.

Army and police accused in massacre
</HEADLINE>
  With Colombia-Exile

<TEXT>
	   BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia (AP) _ Army and police units abetted
the kidnapping of 25 people taken from this oil-refining city and
massacred by a right-wing paramilitary group, human rights
activists said Friday.
	   Outside city hall, families of the victims _ whose bodies were
incinerated_ displayed 25 white wooden coffins with photos of the
dead.
	   The paramilitary group said Thursday it executed the men and
women after trying and convicting them of membership in two leftist
guerrillas fighting the government. The group says it burned the
bodies, which have not been returned to authorities.
	   The May 16 kidnapping by masked gunmen was carried out with the
support of police and army units operating in the area, claimed
Osiris Bayther of the Barrancabermeja-basedRegional Committee for
the Defense of Human Rights.
	   Local army and police chiefs have denied involvement in the
crime. A government investigative commission has been appointed.
	   Bayther called for an investigation into the role of the
security forces, which witnesses placed at the scene of the assault
moments before some 50 masked gunmen entered a poor neighborhood,
killed seven people and carted away 25 others in trucks, she said.
	   News of the executions ended a three-week hostage drama that
riveted residents in this city of 240,000 located 165 miles (265
km) north of Bogota, which was paralyzed Friday by protests against
the massacre.

Funk hold lead as players batter Kemper course

<TEXT>
	   POTOMAC, Maryland (AP) _ Fred Funk broke the 36-hole scoring
record in the Kemper Open with a 12-under-par 130 as he shot a 66
on Friday to take a three-stroke lead over Stuart Appleby, Craig
Parry and Chris DiMarco into the weekend.
	   The TPC at Avenel was virtually helpless on a windless day,
rolling over feebly as player after player attacked.
	   There were 21 eagles plus three holes-in-one.
	   Brad Elder, playing in just his third event since turning pro,
shot a course record-tying 63 and was at 8-under-par 134. Parry
also matched the record with a 63.
	   Brian Kamm made a hole-in-one on the 202-yard (184-meter) 17th
hole with a 5-iron for his third eagle of the day, becoming just
the 10th player since 1970 to make three eagles in a round. He shot
a 66 and was among five players at 135, including defending
champion Justin Leonard, who also had an ace.
	   ``It's the kind of course that just sets up for dramatics,''
Funk said after he made five birdies and no bogeys and continued
his remarkable play just days after laser eye surgery earlier this
week to improve his vision.
	   ``It is a golf course that gives you a lot of shots at birdie,''
Funk said after breaking the 36-hole record by one stroke. ``It
funnels well.''
	   Virtually everyone took their shot and many found the funnel.
	   Funk played what he called ``a good, patient round of golf'' and
made a series of solid putts.
	   Appleby's round sizzled early. Playing the back nine first, he
rolled in a birdie putt on No. 11 and then hit a 1-iron from 240
yards (218 meters) to 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) on No. 13 and made it
for an eagle. He followed that with three consecutive birdies.
	   ``It wasn't very tough today because there was no wind,''
Appleby said. ``If you haven't got the wind you can hit the same
shot over and over and over again. With no wind you take the
guessing out of it.''
	   Parry managed a 66 for his 133 total despite two bogeys, closing
with three birdies on the final final holes.
	   DiMarco shot a 65 despite two bogeys to get a share of second
place at 133.
	   Kamm's first eagle came on the sixth hole when he hit a 5-iron
to nine feet and the second was on No. 13.
	   Elder, who finished his final exams at the University of Texas
on May 12, played the back nine first and got his round going with
an eagle on No. 13.
	   He made three consecutive birdies beginning at No. 15 and
birdied three out of four holes beginning on No. 5 as he matched
the course record.
	   ``Sixty-three is my best score ever,'' Elder said. ``It's hard
for a college player to come out here and be ready to win.''
	   Funk has been on the PGA Tour full time since 1989 and has won
four times. But he has never played well in the Kemper Open, which
is virtually in the Maryland native's backyard.
	   ``I just want to post a good number tomorrow and get into good
position for Sunday,'' he said. ``And then we'll see what
happens.''
	   If Friday was any indication, it will take a lot of birdies _
and perhaps an eagle or two _ to win on the weekend.

Player turns back the clock _ again
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL NEWBERRY  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   ALPHARETTA, Georgia (AP) _ Gary Player keeps defying the
calendar.
	   Two months ago, the 62-year-old South African became the oldest
golfer ever to make the cut at the Masters. On Friday, he was atop
the leaderboard at the PGA Nationwide Championship, vying to become
the second-oldest winner in the history of the Senior PGA Tour.
	   Player, wielding a deft touch with his irons, shot a 5-under-par
67 to grab a share of the lead with 51-year-old Gil Morgan, one of
the youngsters on the tour, relatively speaking.
	   ``It's great to see him do that,'' Morgan said. ``He's such a
competitor. He never gives up.''
	   Player, who will turn 63 on Nov. 1, was in position to become
only the second 62-or-over golfer to win a Senior Tour event. Mike
Fetchick won the 1985 Hilton Head Seniors Invitational on his 63rd
birthday.
	   If there was ever a candidate to make a run at Fetchick's
record, it's Player. He still keeps himself in outstanding physical
condition, despite a demanding travel schedule and a plethora of
outside business interests that cut back his tournament schedule.
	   ``I've looked after myself since I was a young person,'' Player
said. ``I go to the gym, I work out, I watch what I eat. I'm being
rewarded for that.''
	   Player clearly enjoyed himself Friday. He joked around with his
playing partners (fellow South African John Bland and Raymond
Floyd), wiggled his diminutive body as if trying to convince the
ball to go where he wanted, chatted with the gallery and regaled
the media with stories afterwards.
	   ``Anytime you get near 63, this is quite a low round,'' Player
said. ``I'd like to score my age some day, but I think that's going
to take a while.''
	   The opening round at the Golf Club of Georgia in suburban
Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, 40 minutes because of overnight and
morning storms that saturated the grounds with more than three
inches of rain.
	   When Player finally got on the course, playing the back nine
first, he had a bogey at No. 10 and threatened to go 2-over when
his second shot at 14 landed 20 yards (18 meters) short of the
green. His chip wasn't much better, plopping 8 feet from the hole,
but he made the par putt.
	   That sequence seemed to rejuvenate Player, who birdied the next
hole. His irons were magnificent the rest of the way, setting up
four birdie putts from 6 feet (1.8 meters) and in.
	   ``I always wonder what I could have done on these type of
courses when I was younger,'' Player said. ``The greens now are
just perfect.''
	   As it is, he's doing just fine. In April, Player beat Sam
Snead's record as the oldest player to make the Masters cut. The
South African still marvels at being able to play on the weekend at
Augusta National, while younger competitors like Tom Lehman, Tom
Watson, Nick Faldo and Greg Norman went home.
	   The Senior PGA Tour is normally dominated by 50-something
players like Morgan and Hale Irwin, each with three victories this
year. Morgan put himself in contention again by making three long
putts, including a 25-footer (8 meters) for eagle at No. 1, his
10th hole of the day.

Papis leads rain-slowed qualifying session
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE HARRIS  
  AP Motorsports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The grid was practically turned upside down
Friday when some of the lesser-known entries in the ITT Automotive
Detroit Grand Prix, led by Max Papis, got the benefit of a dry
track in the opening round of qualifying.
	   The fastest qualifiers from the previous road race _ in April at
Long Beach, Calif. _ went out for the first 30-minute session and
found a very wet track at Belle Isle Raceway.
	   In fact, CART FedEx Series chief steward Wally Dallenbach
ordered the teams in the first session to start on grooved rain
tires. By the time the rain stopped and the 2.346-mile, 14-turn
street circuit began to dry, it was too late for the fast guys to
take advantage.
	   The slower qualifiers from Long Beach then went out for their
30-minute session and took the top 10 spots on the provisional grid
for Sunday's race.
	   Papis, driving a Reynard-Toyota, led the way with a lap of
1-minute, 17.990-seconds, or 108.291 mph (173.266 kmph) on the
track that was reconfigured from 2.1 miles since last year.
	   The Italian driver, whose best career starts have been 17th at
Laguna Seca in 1996 and Homestead in 1997, understood that, thanks
to the weather, his provisional pole status was suspect. But he was
enjoying the moment.
	   ``Satisfaction is really rare for us,'' Papis said with a wide
grin splitting his face. ``The Toyota people got a gift from God
and it's great satisfaction for one day.
	   ``After a long struggle, this is where we belong. I wish we
could be here all the time.''
	   Since Toyota, which powers four cars, entered its first engines
in CART in 1996, they've had little success and no poles or race
wins.
	   ``This is a beginning,'' Papis said. ``This shows we're making
progress. I hope today shows everybody we've got potential to be
there.''
	   Jimmy Vasser, the winner last week at Milwaukee, also was among
the slower cars from the Long Beach time trials and wound up second
on Friday.
	   ``I don't think today is going to be indicative of the grid
we'll see after tomorrow,'' Vasser said. ``Really, the fast guys
got rain out.''
	   The fastest driver in the opening session was Dario Franchitti,
who wound up 11th in the provisional lineup.
	   Series points leader Alex Zanardi, fast in the morning practice,
was 22nd in qualifying.
	   Only the top 10 drivers actually qualified on Friday because the
CART rules stipulate that all drivers making a race field must be
within 110 percent of the fastest qualifier.
	   ``I guess we'll be OK,'' Zanardi said. ``I'm told the weather
for Saturday and Sunday will be decent, with no rain. If that's
true, everything will get back in order tomorrow.''

French jet makes emergency landing after engine failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ A French plane carrying 167 passengers
made an emergency landing following an engine failure, shortly
after takeoff from this southern Turkish city early Saturday,
according to news reports. No injuries were reported.
	   The France Lines' MD-80 plane touched down at 1.40 a.m. (1040
GMT) on its belly on the foam covered runway of the Ataturk airport
of Antalya after dumping its fuel over the Mediterranean Sea,
according to ATV television.
	   It stopped after sliding almost the entire length of the runway.
	   The Anatolia news agency said all passengers and six crew
members were evacuated.
	   ``We heard a big explosion following the takeoff,'' a French
passenger, only identified by his first name Nicola, told ATV as he
left the plane. ``Everybody is O.K.''
	   The plane was en route from Antalya's Ataturk Airport to Paris.
	   ATV said the plane's rear landing gear blew up during takeoff
and flying tire pieces stopped one of its two engines.
	   ``Everything seems under control,'' Tourism Minister Ibrahim
Gurdal said.

  By The Associated Press  
  BAHAMAS: Last big group of Cuban refugees sent home  

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas put its last big group of
Cuban refugees on a plane to Havana Friday, acting on a new policy
to slam shut the last practical escape route for people desperate
enough to risk their lives on makeshift rafts.
	   Sixty-eight refugees flew home Friday, a senior government
official confirmed on condition of anonymity.
	   ``This is a tragic thing,'' said Brothers to the Rescue head
Jose Basulto, whose Miami-based organization flies planes to spot
Cuban rafters. ``Now there is no escape for those people who want
to leave Castro behind, and the dictatorship.''
	   Bahamian officials say their new policy is aimed at discouraging
Cubans from using their territory as a way station to the United
States. They cite the expense of housing and feeding hundreds a
year.
  EL SALVADOR: Cuba and El Salvador ``sister cities'' cause dispute
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A plan to make sister cities of
the Cuban and Salvadoran capitals has turned into more of a family
feud.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol announced Thursday that his
government would not allow a visit by Havana Mayor Conrado
Martinez, who was invited by San Salvador Mayor Hector Silva as
part of a sister city project.
	   Calderon Sol's party supported a war against pro-Cuban leftist
rebels in the 1980s. Silva was elected in a coalition that includes
those former leftists, now a political party.
	   ``We are brothers of the Cuban people, but what impedes foreign
relations is the line of the government'' of Cuba's President Fidel
Castro, Calderon Sol said in remarks published by newspapers here
Friday.
	   The hard-line Interior Minister, Mario Acosta, was even more
blunt earlier: ``No Cuban enters.''
  VIRGIN ISLANDS: Regulators urge negotiated settlement in
barge-ferry spat
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Government
regulators reversed a ruling that would have stopped commercial
barges from carrying passengers between St. Thomas and St. John and
told the ferry and barge companies to try to settle their dispute
by July 6.
	   The dispute centers on the barges allowing passengers to ride in
the cars they carry between the islands. The ferry companies said
in a 1996 complaint that the practice had caused them to lose half
a million dollars.
	   Public Service Commission Chairman Walter Challenger said this
week that he was going to give the companies one more chance to
reach a negotiated settlement. If that fails, he warned, the
commission will have to act.
  BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: Committee to choose new regional Supreme
Court chief
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ A new chief justice of
the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court will be chosen by a special
committee within the next six months, several national leaders
said.
	   The post has been filled by acting Justice Denis Byron of St.
Kitts and Nevis for nearly two years.
	   The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States heads of government
appointed a committee to fill the vacancy at their meeting here May
27-29.
	   Antigua Prime Minister Lester Bird said afterwards that the
committee would make a recommendation before the next meeting of
the heads of state at the end of November.
  JAMAICA: Anti-noise law takes effect
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Police say it will be a quiet weekend
in Jamaica. And if not, they'll hand out fines.
	   A new Noise Abatement Act takes effect this weekend. Discos will
have to turn down the volume, bars will have to quiet down at 2
a.m. and playing a musical instrument in the street is also
prohibited within 100 meters (330 feet) of a home, hotel, hospital
or other places where someone might be trying to get some sleep.
	   Police say they are serious about enforcing the law and have set
up a special phone lines so residents can call in with complaints.
Special teams of police and soldiers will be patrolling.

STED Bogota  
  With Colombia-Exile

<TEXT>
	   BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia (AP) _ Army and police units abetted
the kidnapping of 25 people taken from this oil-refining city and
massacred by a right-wing paramilitary group, human rights
activists said Friday.
	   Outside city hall, families of the victims _ whose bodies were
incinerated_ displayed 25 white wooden coffins with photos of the
dead.
	   The paramilitary group said Thursday it executed the men and
women after trying and convicting them of membership in two leftist
guerrillas fighting the government. The group says it burned the
bodies, which have not been returned to authorities.
	   The May 16 kidnapping by masked gunmen was carried out with the
support of police and army units operating in the area, claimed
Osiris Bayther of the Barrancabermeja-based Regional Committee for
the Defense of Human Rights.
	   Local army and police chiefs have denied involvement in the
crime. A government investigative commission has been appointed.
	   Bayther called for an investigation into the role of the
security forces, which witnesses placed at the scene of the assault
moments before some 50 masked gunmen entered a poor neighborhood,
killed seven people and carted away 25 others in trucks, she said.
	   News of the executions ended a three-week hostage drama that
riveted residents and sparked riots in Barrancabermeja, paralyzing
the city of 240,000, which is 165 miles (265 km) north of the
capital, Bogota.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Brant Brown hit a leadoff home run in the 12th
inning to give the Cubs a 6-5 victory over the White Sox on Friday
in the first official Wrigley Field game between the Chicago
rivals.
	   The last time the two met at a Cubs park in a game that counted
was the 1906 World Series at West Side Grounds. The White Sox won
that series 4-2.
	   Brown hit his sixth homer of the season over the right-field
wall off Tony Castillo (1-2) to give the Cubs their seventh
straight victory. Terry Mulholland (2-1) allowed one hit in a
scoreless 12th for the victory.
	   The Cubs threatened in the 10th, loading the bases with one out,
but Matt Karchner struck out Sammy Sosa, who homered in the fifth,
and Jeff Blauser, who had three hits on the day.
	   The White Sox lost a chance to take the lead in the eighth when
Magglio Ordonez's line drive into the gap in right center was lost
in the ivy for a ground-rule double, forcing Wil Cordero to stop at
third base.
	   The White Sox tied it at 5 with a three-run sixth off Steve
Trachsel. Robin Ventura had an RBI single, Ordonez followed with a
run-scoring groundout and Chad Kreuter hit a two-out, RBI single.
	   Henry Rodriguez put the Cubs in front 3-2 with a three-run
double in the third. Sosa made it 5-2 in the fifth with his two-run
homer off rookie left-hander Jim Parque.
	   The White Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first on Albert Belle's RBI
double and Ventura's run-scoring single.
	   The Cubs had 13 walks and had the bases loaded in the second,
third, fifth and 10th innings.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ The reason for a rattling that alarmed
some passengers in the minutes before the crash of InterCity
Express 884 now seems clear: Investigators said Friday that a
broken wheel was the most likely cause of the disaster. The 93rd
victim from Wednesday's crash was recovered Friday under a 33-foot
(10-meter) piece of road that had fallen next to the high-speed
train. That brought the death toll to 98, including five who died
in hospitals _ two of them Friday. Rescue workers said they could
not rule an increase in the death toll until all the debris was
cleared from the four-track line. The damaged wheel that has become
the focus of investigators' questions was located on the first car
behind the locomotive. (GERMANY-TRAIN DERAILS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Some of the thousands fleeing the
latest Serbian offensive in Kosovo don't make it, dying of
exhaustion along the way. In villages wiped out by fighting,
corpses lie unburied and farm animals roam wild. Reports said
Friday that 50 people were killed and 200 were missing in the past
week. Survivors were hiding in the woods, most trying to cross the
border into neighboring Albania. A statement by Serb police
indicated the offensive had ended, having destroyed the ``terrorist
gangs'' who tried to block Kosovo's key north-south road. It said
civilians could safely return. Still, hundreds continued to flee.
Most were ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people and demand independence from Serbia, the larger of
two republics remaining in Yugoslavia. Serbian troops are trying to
quash the separatist drive. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian military planes bombed an air
force base outside the Eritrean capital Friday before being shot
down by Eritrean anti-aircraft guns in an escalating border dispute
between two of the world's poorest countries. Two Ethiopian MiG-23
fighter planes on Friday afternoon bombed two hangars at an air
base outside Asmara that is adjacent to the international airport.
A commercial airliner on the tarmac was reported damaged. Eritrean
guns then shot the planes down. Witnesses saw several injured
people being transported in trucks, but it was not immediately
possible to determine the number of wounded or the fate of the
Ethiopian pilots. In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the
Foreign Ministry said the bombing was in retaliation for an
Eritrean attack on Mekele, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Addis, on Friday that wounded five Ethiopians. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nine months after the death of Princess Diana, a
French judge gathered witnesses, paparazzi and a platoon of lawyers
under one roof Friday, trying to determine once and for all whether
photographers were to blame for the crash. The all-day meeting
wasn't expected to yield any immediate ruling. But it was a way for
Judge Herve Stephan, who leads the massive investigation, to try to
balance conflicting accounts in the case file. The high-speed crash
in a Paris tunnel Aug. 31 killed Diana, her companion, Dodi Fayed,
and driver Henri Paul. Tests showed Paul was drunk at the time, and
investigators long have believed that is the main cause of the
crash, in addition to speed. But Stephan still needs to determine
the role of nine photographers and one press motorcyclist who have
been in legal limbo _ under investigation, but not formally charged
_ for nearly a year. (DIANA-INVESTIGATION)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Unable to shield Colombia's human rights
workers from threats and violence, President Ernesto Samper is
offering them tickets on the next plane out. A government fund will
allow 30 to 40 threatened activists to live and study abroad until
they feel safe returning home, Samper said. ``If they want to
voluntarily go abroad until the circumstances clear up, I am
obliged to find a way to help them,'' the Colombian leader told The
Associated Press in an interview this week. While human rights
monitors say the program could provide relief, some wonder about
the president's motives. Last year, 27 Colombian human rights
activists were assassinated, up from eight in 1996, according to
Colombian Commission of Jurists. Two have been shot dead this year.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average shot back above
9,000 on Friday as new signs of a resilient U.S. economy eased
concerns about the impact of Asia's financial crisis on American
companies. The Dow rose 167.15 points to 9,037.71, the biggest gain
in four months and the first close above 9,000 in two weeks. Most
broad-market indicators also posted big gains, although the Nasdaq
composite index rose only modestly as investors remained hesitant
about the technology group's heavy exposure to the Asian economy.
(US-CLOSING-STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Unemployment in the United States held at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent in May as the economy churned out nearly
300,000 new jobs, overcoming fallout from Asia's economic turmoil.
Stocks shot higher on Wall Street. The seasonally adjusted rate
matched April's and was the lowest since February 1970. Many
analysts had considered the April rate, down from 4.7 percent in
March, a fluke. But Friday's report, from the Labor Department,
underscores the labor market's strength. Economists said the
stronger-than-expected report, which also showed healthy wage
gains, raised the prospect that the Federal Reserve might raise
interest rates later this year to slow economic growth and thus
pre-empt any acceleration in inflation. (US-ECONOMY)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
faced off Friday in another strike that pits the automaker's desire
to become leaner and more competitive against the union's effort to
save jobs. Nearly 3,400 workers at GM's Flint Metal Center north of
Detroit, Michigan went on strike after talks failed to yield an
agreement. It is the seventh strike at a GM plant in the United
States since early 1997. A strike of more than a few days would
lead to shortages of hoods, fenders, doors and other parts, forcing
closures of GM assembly plants throughout North America. (US-GM
STRIKE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The realities of global commerce caught up with a
grand remnant of British glory Friday as Volkswagen AG won approval
to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, infuriating small English investors.
``Should I call it now a Rolls-wagen?'' incredulous shareholder
Rodney Crowe asked at a meeting called by Vickers PLC, the
engineering group that is selling Rolls-Royce to the Germans.
Shareholders approved Volkswagen's 430 million pound (dlrs 700
million) deal over a 340 million pound (dlrs 554 million) offer
from rival BMW, in a raucous session punctuated by outbursts of
nationalism. Vickers, an engineering group almost thrown out of
business by Rolls-Royce's losses in the last recession, said the
sale was the best way forward for all concerned.
(BRITAIN-ROLLS-ROYCE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Switzerland's three major banks met Friday with
lawyers for Holocaust victims in an attempt to settle lawsuits
claiming the banks failed to return assets from the victims'
wartime accounts. Credit Suisse, the Union Bank of Switzerland and
the Swiss Bank Corp. were expected to offer more than dlrs 1
billion to settle the lawsuits, a source close to the negotiations
told The Associated Press Friday. Stuart Eizenstat, the Clinton
administration's representative to the negotiations, contacted
plaintiffs' lawyers Thursday to tell them of the pending offer, the
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The two sides were
expected to meet all day in New York, the source said, adding that
it could take weeks to negotiate a final deal. In Zurich, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group denied reports of a
settlement offer. (US-SWISS BANKS)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Like El Nino, the Asian economic crisis has
become a timely scapegoat for American companies set to report poor
results, but analysts said Friday that Motorola Inc.'s problems
extend back to strategic blunders made years ago. The Schaumburg,
Illinois-based semiconductor and cellular telephone maker said late
Thursday that it will slash 15,000 employees, or 10 percent of its
work force, and could lose money in the second quarter even before
it takes about dlrs 2 billion in charges. Asian competitors,
particularly from South Korea, have been sharply cutting prices to
weather the economic damage in their countries, taking business
from Motorola. Demand in that region, meanwhile, has fallen
sharply. (US-MOTOROLA LAYOFFS)

Peru's finance minister resigns as cabinet shake-up continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Finance Minister Jorge Camet, the most
powerful free-market advocate in President Alberto Fujimori's
cabinet, resigned Friday in the second day of a cabinet shake-up.
	   He was replaced by Jorge Baca, the head of Peru's tax collection
agency. Under Baca, the agency increased tax collection levels and
established tough laws to crack down on violators.
	   Camet, 73, had been in office since January 1993 and was the
longest-serving member of Fujimori's cabinet. He had fought for
Peru to maintain its free-market course and stick to its economic
reform program.
	   Camet's resignation came a day after Prime Minister Alberto
Pandolfi, the head of cabinet, resigned and was replaced by the
populist Javier Valle Riestra, a former senator with the Aprista
party of disgraced former President Alan Garcia.
	   Analysts said that with the cabinet shuffle Fujimori may be
preparing to implement free-spending policies to shore up his
sagging popularity to prepare for a re-election bid in 2000.
	   No official reason was given for Camet's or Pandolfi's
resignations.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A provincial governor in
Argentina who faced impeachment following the discovery of an
undisclosed Swiss bank account was cleared Friday by a legislative
tribunal.
	   The panel of provincial lawmakers voted 16-12 to absolve Antonio
Bussi, governor of the northern Tucuman province, allowing him
remain in office. A vote on impeachment would have required a
two-thirds majority.
	   The account, which Bussi failed to disclose as required by law,
was discovered in February during investigations surrounding the
1976-83 Argentine military dictatorship.
	   The former general, who governs the same province he ran during
the military's rule, was accused of misconduct as an elected
official. He was suspended for 60 days in April.
	   He denied any wrongdoing, calling it an ``error of omission.''
	   Human rights groups charge the money was plundered from victims
of the military's ``dirty war'' on leftists and dissidents, which
left 9,000 dead or missing. The groups accuse Bussi of taking part
in the executions.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers in Argentina
said Friday they will launch impeachment proceedings against five
Supreme Court judges, alleging poor performance on the bench.
	   Left-of-center Frepaso Party Deputy Carlos Alvarez claimed
``more than sufficient'' evidence existed to seek the ouster of
five of the court's nine judges, including its president.
	   A Supreme Court spokeswoman said there would be no official
comment Friday.
	   The five judges have backed the government's stance in several
recent high-profile cases.
	   President Carlos Menem's allies are seeking ways around a
constitutional provision barring the president from being elected
to a third consecutive term.
	   Lower courts have upheld the ban as valid, though analysts
speculate Menem's allies have a better shot at the high court,
which the president expanded in 1990 and then packed with his own
appointees.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With pollution levels rising sharply once
again, officials declared emergency anti-smog measures in Mexico's
sprawling capital on Friday, a week after lifting a four-day
emergency decree.
	   Most cars with odd-numbered license plates will be barred from
streets on Saturday and industries are ordered to cut back
activity.
	   Evening rains have helped cut the smoke from fires that had
aggravated other recent smog problems. But stagnant air trapped
pollution in the high-altitude valley.
	   Similar restrictions were imposed due to high pollution levels
four days last week.
	   The new alert is the first declared under tougher new rules,
which trigger alerts at 240 points of ozone on the smog index
rather than 250.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Work began Friday on transforming a former
U.S. military base into a luxury tourist and commercial center that
Panama hopes will create thousands of jobs and help make up for the
loss of U.S. military spending.
	   A private Panamanian company, Constructora Urbana, will spend
the next 18 months clearing buildings from the former Fort Amador,
building new access roads and installing water and sewer lines.
	   Construction on the new tourist resort will begin as soon as
infrastructure work is completed. Plans call for seven hotels, a
commercial center, cruise-ship docks and two marinas. Panama hopes
the project will create an estimated 3,000 jobs.
	   Just minutes away from Panama City, Amador is a 398-acre
(160-hectare) peninsula extending into the Pacific Ocean at the
entrance to the Panama Canal.
	   It was built between 1911 and 1915 as an artillery installation
to protect the canal. Under a 1977 treaty, the United States will
turn over all its military posts and the canal to Panama by the end
of 1999.

Time for a Spanish sweep at Roland Garros?
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECAPS previous  
  By JOCELYN NOVECK  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Spanish players have always excelled on clay
courts, which they grow up on. This year, they have a chance to
prove that with a sweep of the men's and women's French Open
titles.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario gets the first shot. She won two of her
three Grand Slam titles here, and is very comfortable on the red
clay of Roland Garros.
	   But she's up against someone who's done even better here. Monica
Seles won three times, from 1990-92. Then came the horrible
stabbing by a crazed fan in 1993, which kept her off the tour for
two and a half years.
	   Now, she's turned adversity into her ally. Her father's death
May 14 seems to have given her new reason to excel; she says her
dad would have wanted her to play here. She's looking like the old
Monica again.
	   Seles shook up the tournament Thursday, when she ousted
top-seeded Martina Hingis, the overwhelming favorite, in the
semifinals.
	   Even more daunting for Sanchez Vicario, Seles is 14-2 against
the Spaniard, including a 6-3, 6-4 win in the 1991 final.
	   Then, Seles' father was watching from the players' box. This
time, she'll be wearing his ring on a chain around her neck.
	   Whatever happens on the women's side, the men's champion will be
a guy from Barcelona.
	   Carlos Moya went out with buddy Felix Mantilla for ice cream
before clobbering him in the semifinals. Now Moya is making dinner
plans with another close friend, Alex Corretja, whom he'll face in
an all-Spanish men's final on Sunday.
	   ``Maybe we can have dinner together. That's the most important
thing, we're going to be friends even if I win or if he wins,''
Corretja said. ``We have to find our game on the court, and then
just enjoy the party.''
	   Moya, Mantilla and Corretja all live in Barcelona and hang out
together on the road.
	   On a muggy center court Friday, Corretja defeated local hero
Cedric Pioline of France in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, to join
Moya in the final. Moya won 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 over Mantilla, yet
another Spaniard.
	   It will be the second all-Spanish final in five years at the
French Open. Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto Berasategui for the
1994 title.
	   ``Alex is a close friend of mine,'' Moya said. ``But when you
get on the court, you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything,
you try to step on him if necessary.''
	   Pioline, hoping to become the first Frenchman to win at Roland
Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983, had played three five-setters in
reaching the semifinals and appeared drained.
	   ``I felt I did everything a bit slowly. On top of that, you're
not as focused when you're tired. You don't make the right
decisions,'' he said.
	   Corretja noticed.
	   ``I saw that Cedric was not feeling so well, he was struggling
on the court,''
	   Moya mixed powerful groundstrokes with delicate drop shots to
throw off Mantilla, who preferred to rally patiently from the
baseline. Moya also served 10 aces.
	   The Spaniards split the first two sets and Mantilla took a 4-1
lead in the third. But Moya won the next five games, losing just
five points.
	   ``I just decided to take more risks than I was taking before,''
Moya said. ``I decided there had to be a change, otherwise that set
was for him. Two sets to one down, it's tough to come back.''
	   Moya got to match point with a 127-mph (203-kmph) serve, then
hit a 122-mph (195-kmph) service winner to finish off the 2-hour,
42-minute match. He hit a ball into the stands, then tossed his
white bandana to fans.
	   Moya was runnerup at the 1997 Australian Open, but said he will
be less awed in a final this time.
	   ``In Australia, just to be in the final was a surprise for me.
But here is different.
	   ``I don't want to lose in the final again.''

Annan uses strong language to denounce Serb ``atrocities'' in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo  
  Eds: RECAPS previous  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In an language rarely used against a
member state, the United Nations is accusing Serb military and
paramilitary forces of ``atrocities'' in Kosovo, where fighting has
driven thousands from their homes.
	   ``(Secretary-General Kofi Annan) is deeply disturbed by the
latest reports of an intensifying campaign against the unarmed
civilian population in Kosovo,'' U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt
said Friday.
	   ``He reiterates in the strongest possible terms his condemnation
of the atrocities committed by Serbian military and paramilitary
forces,'' Brandt added, reading from an official U.N. statement.
	   ``They must not be allowed to repeat the campaign of ethnic
cleansing and indiscriminate attacks on civilians that
characterized the war in Bosnia,'' the statement added.
	   ``If the world has learned anything from that dire chapter in
history, it is that this kind of aggression must be confronted
immediately and with determination.''
	   The statement was unusual because it specifically accused Serb
forces of atrocities in a military action within areas which the
international community recognizes as part of the Serbian republic.
	   The United Nations is often reluctant to level such accusations
against sovereign governments for actions within their borders.
	   The Security Council discussed the deteriorating situation in
Kosovo on Friday. More than 250 people have died since March 1 in
escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence
movement.
	   The council president, Ambassador Antonio Monteiro of Portugal,
said the 15 members ``expressed their grave concern'' and called
for the ``immediate cessation'' of violence, especially ``the
excessive use of force'' against civilians.
	   ``We all, I think, share the view that unfortunately, Belgrade
seems to be trying to impose a military solution upon the Kosovo
issue,'' British Ambassador John Weston said.
	   Weston said he expects the council to consider ``additional
measures'' beyond the arms embargo imposed last March on Yugoslavia
to urge a political solution.
	   At a news conference, Yugoslavia's acting U.N. ambassador,
Vladislav Jovanovic, said the Serb government, which along with
Montenegro forms the Yugoslav federation, was ``firmly committed''
to a ``serious and productive dialogue'' with Kosovo Albanians.
	   ``But first of all, the terrorist activities and banditry should
cease at once and those from Albanian side and the outside world
who are ambivalent about terrorism should make a very firm and very
clear statement condemning the terrorism,'' Jovanovic said.

Security Council threatening new measures in Angola
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: RECAPS previous  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Three nations overseeing the Angolan peace
process will submit a draft resolution to the Security Council with
``additional measures'' against UNITA unless it fulfills
commitments under a 1994 agreement, Portugal's U.N. ambassador
says.
	   Ambassador Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, president of the
council for this month, said experts from the ``troika'' powers _
the United States, Russia and Portugal _ would submit the draft
``as soon as possible'' in hopes of preventing renewal of the civil
war.
	   Monteiro gave no details but said the resolution ``envisages
adoption of additional measures if UNITA will not comply with its
commitments.''
	   Last October, the Security Council imposed air and travel
sanctions against UNITA, a former rebel movement, in addition to an
oil and weapons embargo in effect since 1993.
	   Monteiro said the three observer countries had agreed among
themselves on the proposed measures but he would not discuss them
before the draft resolution was circulated to the full 15-member
council.
	   ``This is a very, very serious situation in Angola,'' Monteiro
told reporters. ``We want very much to save the peace process.''
	   The U.N. special representative to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye,
briefed the council Friday on the much delayed implementation of
the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement between the government and UNITA, a
former rebel movement.
	   Beye said earlier this week that UNITA was hiding armed men in
remote areas of the vast southwest African nation, despite the
movement's pledge that it demobilized its 70,000-strong guerrilla
army.
	   UNITA has denied the allegation.
	   Before the council meeting, diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Beye would insist on new sanctions
against UNITA and threatened to resign if the parties did not
fulfill terms of the peace plan.
	   Beye made no statement to reporters after the meeting. Monteiro
said Beye ``had mentioned that possibility'' but said the envoy
``decided with courage that he has to assume his
responsibilities,'' meaning stay on.
	   UNITA's secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato dismissed the
council actions as part of ``an international conspiracy'' against
the rebel movement.
	   Speaking by telephone from UNITA's central highland stronghold
at Bailundo, Paulo Lukamba Gato said Beye's report was ``a bad
mistake'' and ``very dangerous'' for the peace process.
	   He said reports that UNITA had armed men hidden in the bush was
based on unreliable third-hand reports and ``could cost the peace
process dearly'' by prompting the government to launch a military
offensive.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a two-decade civil war
against the government following the southwest African nation's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to the bush.

Security Council considers resolution against nuclear programs in
</HEADLINE>
South Asia  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in
South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution
urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and
denying nuclear status to the two rivals.
	   Friday's draft resolution also calls on India and Pakistan to
exercise restraint and find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to
the ``root causes of those tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   Japan pushed for quick council action on the resolution as a
followup to Thursday's meeting in Geneva of foreign ministers of
the five longtime nuclear states _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China.
	   Following the Geneva meeting, the five _ also permanent members
of the council _ condemned Indian and Pakistani tests and pledged
to cooperate closely ``to prevent a ``nuclear and missile arms race
in the subcontinent.''
	   Council diplomats continued closed-door consultations late
Friday trying to work out language acceptable to all 15 members _
especially the 10 non-permanent members who were not represented at
the Geneva meeting.
	   It was unclear whether the resolution, co-sponsored by Sweden
and Costa Rica, would be put to a vote Friday night or possibly
Saturday.
	   The draft resolution repeated the position of the five that
although India and Pakistan have exploded nuclear devices, they
would not be accorded status as nuclear states.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
countries were the only ones allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals.
India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty, pointing to
that exemption as unfair.
	   The Japanese resolution also welcomed an offer by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to
resume a high-level dialogue which broke down last year because of
differences over Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them Kashmir which is divided between them.
	   The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the
export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''

Trade not the pick-me-up Asia was looking for

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ It was supposed to be the silver
lining in Asia's financial crash.
	   Currencies weakened by the meltdown would make Asian goods
cheaper in the United States and elsewhere. Exports would surge,
and that would give a lift to the battered economies of Thailand,
South Korea and others.
	   But that hasn't exactly happened, despite the predictions voiced
widely in the United States and Asia.
	   Instead, the overseas sales of some Asian nations are falling,
and in others aren't rising enough to make a difference.
	   So what happened to the hoped for export boom?
	   ``It was unrealistic in the first place,'' said Dan Harwood,
head of research at ABN Amro Asia Ltd. in Seoul.
	   In the past, Asian tigers like Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea may have exported their way to rapid growth. But that was
when investment was plentiful, credit was cheap and customers were
abundant.
	   Now, foreign investors have fled. Some of the nations' banking
systems are failing and their interest rates are high. Many
exporters are unable to get the credit they need to keep operating
at a profit, to buy materials for manufacturing.
	   And that's even when banks have the money to spare.
	   A dlrs 575 million Bank of Thailand fund for exporters went
undistributed by commercial banks last year. With their bad loans
already estimated at 30 percent, Thai financial institutions were
unwilling to risk making any more questionable loans.
	   In Indonesia and elsewhere, if banks are willing to lend at all,
it's at crushing interest rates, ratcheted up as part of conditions
attached to International Monetary Fund bailouts last year.
	   Then there's the problem of lower demand. Asian nations have
traditionally been each other's trading partners _ and many of
those partners are drastically cutting imports.
	   ``Trade between Asian countries was good, but general (world)
demand is slowing and suddenly you've got a lot of Asian countries
that are competing with themselves,'' said Harwood.
	   ``They have no domestic markets and suddenly they're competing
for a finite part of (the market in) Europe, the United States,
Africa.''
	   Profitability of exports also has been hit by falling prices.
South Korea is thinking about cutting production of computer chips
because a glut in the market has so weakened prices.
	   Malaysia, with half of its market in the European Union and
troubled Asia, was further hit by declining prices for key exports
such as petroleum, palm oil and rubber.
	   ``The economy is at risk of going nowhere,'' said Joanne Song,
economist with PhileoAllied Securities in the capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Indeed, prospects for the rest of the year don't look good. For
as poor as Asian export performances have been, the picture for
imports has been worse.
	   Lackluster exports and severely reduced imports may have led to
trade surpluses in South Korea and elsewhere. But import cutbacks
have come from not only slumping consumer demand but also lowered
demand for raw materials and capital goods such as machinery.
	   And, again, that's because Asian businesses can't get the credit
to buy those goods.
	   ``Fewer imports of raw materials now means fewer exports in the
future,'' said Lee Pil-sang, economics professor at Korea
University.
	   Further weighing on the future is the question of Japan.
	   Some economists had hoped Japan would take a stronger role in
spurring the region's economies by boosting domestic consumption
and opening up its markets to more Asian goods.
	   Instead, Japan bought 15 percent less from Asian exporters in
April compared with a year ago _ and its weakening yen is making
for even stiffer competition among Asian exporters of cars, steel,
electronics and other goods.
	   ``They're all in a difficult position,'' said Harwood. ``They've
got to grow themselves out of this, kick-start their own internal
economies.''

Czech pensioners fight for brighter political future

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ No one took it very seriously when
a group of Czech pensioners fed up with the rising cost of living
banded together to form a political party.
	   But the Pensioners for Secure Life are becoming a political
force that cannot be ignored _ an essential partner for the leading
Social Democrats if they hope to form a government after next
week's parliamentary elections.
	   Founded in 1990, the party's agenda, focusing on the need for
higher pensions, has not changed over the years. But with a high
standard of living not coming as quickly as people had hoped, more
of the Czech Republic's 2 million-plus pensioners seem to be
listening.
	   After two previous failures, the party looks set to finally
clear the 5 percent threshold necessary to get into parliament.
	   ``The pensioners' party is the only party offering something
that can improve my standard of living,'' said Jarmila Pepichova,
70, a retired postwoman. ``They are the only ones who say something
that makes sense to me.''
	   Some opinion polls give the party nearly 10 percent support,
roughly three times its backing in 1996 elections.
	   This has center-right politicians and analysts warning that the
party, known by its initials DZJ, could become the third
``extremist'' party represented in parliament, along with the
Communists and the nationalist Republicans.
	   ``From the mud of Czech politics ... DZJ has emerged, a party
with a program that has extreme populism as its leitmotif,''
liberal analyst Bohumil Dolezal wrote recently. ``But, unlike
Communists and Republicans, Pensioners have the image of good old
boys struggling for mere survival.''
	   The opposition Social Democrats, who lead the polls with 24
percent, say they would have no trouble forming a coalition with
the Pensioners since the party focuses mainly on social issues.
	   Eduard Kremlicka, the party's chairman, complains that pensions
are too low and demands they be raised to at least 60 percent of an
average monthly salary. About one-fifth of the country's 10.5
million people receive monthly pensions.
	   Official figures show the average pension in the Czech Republic
was $148, or 45 percent of a gross average salary in 1997, down
from 51 percent in 1990.
	   Kremlicka also wants the state to provide everyone with
low-budget housing, health care and education.
	   ``We are not a party for a secure life for pensioners, we are
pensioners' party for a secure life for all,'' said the 68-year-old
retired officer of the country's former communist army.
	   The party's electorate, however, seems to be larger in the
countryside than in cities, where the standard of living is higher.
Only a dozen people attended a recent meeting in the capital.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescue crews searching for survivors of
a deadly high-speed train crash in Germany prepared for rest and
reflection as they hoped by Saturday to finish clearing the site.
	   ``I've never had to deal with so many dead people,'' said Dirk
Winkler, a 25-year-old soldier whose tank battalion has been using
its vehicles to pull back the wreckage from Wednesday's crash of
the InterCity Express 884.
	   Rescuers uncovered the 93rd body in the wreckage Friday
afternoon, bringing the death toll to 98, including five who died
in hospitals. By evening, rescuers prodding the sandy dirt with
slow gentle care were finding only body fragments, coming close to
the end of their search.
	   Police expected to finish clearing the site of bodies by
Saturday morning, although heavy rains overnight threatened to slow
the work.
	   While doctors working round the clock will continue to identify
the victims over the weekend, the rescuers _ soldiers, firefighters
and Red Cross volunteers _ should get some needed rest. But rest
will also bring reflection, time to consider the grim impact of
what they've been doing.
	   By Friday, investigators had identified a likely cause of the
disaster: A wheel broke on the first passenger car. Two minutes
later, the derailed train started breaking apart and crashed into
supports of an overpass.
	   After recalling all the ICE trains for inspection, the German
Rail company ordered trains returning to circulation to run slower,
with a top speed of 160 kph (100 mph), rather than the usual
maximum of 280 kph (175 mph).
	   When the train hit the bridge, it was traveling at 200 kph (125
mph). With a huge yellow crane, rescuers on Friday lifted the last
fragment of the collapsed bridge from the top of the smashed train.
The cable creaked from the weight.
	   Underneath, they found the body buried in the sand.
	   Like all the other bodies, this one was taken to a hospital
morgue in Hanover, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. By
Friday, only 19 victims had been identified because of the mangled
conditions of many of the bodies.
	   ``We don't want any relatives to have to go from body to body.
because it's unbearable. It's arms and legs and heads. It's
awful,'' said Christian Jung, spokesman for the Hanover medical
school hospital.
	   Rescuers, like the doctors, have worked almost continuously
since arriving at the scene of the worst accident on Germany's
railways since World War II on Wednesday. During a break on Friday,
they seemed both dazed and animated, pumped up from stress and on
automatic-pilot to cope with it.
	   Some described little tricks _ everyday chit-chat at the site,
silly jokes on the way home in the car. Anything to distract the
mind from what the hands have been doing, and the eyes seeing.
	   ``We have to be strong,'' said Birgit Aust, 25, a Red Cross
volunteer. ``The worst moment was when I got there and saw the
bridge on top of the train. Then I shut off. You have to suppress
all that right now. Otherwise, you can't keep going.''
	   Aust said she expected to work through the weekend, recovering
the remains of the dead and comforting the victims' relatives.
	   Next week _ when the gravity hits _ she plans to seek comfort
herself, through counseling.

Air France strike enters sixth day; pilots pessimistic

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup fast approaching, a spokesman
for Air France pilots offered a grim appraisal of talks aimed at
ending a strike now in its sixth day.
	   ``They're at a standstill,'' said Christian Paris, a spokesman
for the SNPL pilots' union, shortly before the fourth round of
talks began Friday evening between pilots and company officials.
	   Asked what the main stumbling blocks were between both sides, he
said, ``practically everything.'' The talks were expected to
continue through the night.
	   His blunt response was in stark contrast to assurances from top
sports officials that the June 10-July 12 World Cup _ to be
disputed by 32 countries _ would go ahead, and that France would
play the perfect host.
	   ``I can assure you that all 64 matches will be played and that
the French will do everything possible to welcome the foreigners
coming to France,'' said Sepp Blatter, a senior soccer official and
candidate for the sport's top job _ head of the world governing
body FIFA.
	   Michel Platini, former French soccer great and co-president of
the World Cup organizing committee, said five years of planning
would not be wrecked by labor disputes.
	   ``De Gaulle once said it was difficult to govern a country with
360 types of cheese. But we shall persevere,'' he said, referring
to former French leader Gen. Charles de Gaulle.
	   Across France, travelers were stranded again Friday, as several
long-distance train services were canceled, offering no alternative
to frustrated air travelers.
	   Hani Samaha, a 33-year-old Lebanese man looking to reroute his
flight after one to the United Arab Emirates was canceled, said:
``I left France a long time ago. And every time I come back, it's
stressful.''
	   ``Look at Air France's publicity,'' he said pointing at the
French company's billboard which said ``Official World Cup Air
Line'' at a ticketing office on the Champs Elysees.
	   ``It doesn't do the French image much good, does it?''
	   Stephane Jourdain, 19, said soccer fans would not remember ``a
beautiful country, but one immobilized by public service workers
not doing their work.''
	   ``It's organized chaos,'' she said while standing in line at the
same office.
	   Air France's highly paid pilots are protesting planned salary
cuts. The company wants to give them stock in exchange for (500
million francs) dlrs 83 million in pay cuts.
	   The pilots are scheduled to strike for at least 15 days and have
said the stoppage, which began Monday, could even be extended,
paralyzing the World Cup that runs until July 12.
	   Air France, whose planes carry images of the stars of the World
Cup, say all teams will be transported during the tournament.
	   Still, many teams already have been inconvenienced.
	   Many French players could not get back to their training base on
time Monday after a three-day holiday weekend. The U.S. team, which
arrived Friday, took a special charter to avoid the strike.
	   For Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of France's main CNPF
employers' association, the blame lay squarely at the government's
door.
	   France ``is a country which no longer functions,'' he said.
``It's the government's responsibility to get Air France back to
work again.''

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Adapting to stepped-up pressure from law
enforcement, a new breed of Colombian drug trafficker has abandoned
the model of the huge narcotics cartel and is shunning ostentation
in favor of a low-key lifestyle.
	   Out are bodyguards and armor-plated Toyota Landcruisers. In are
taxis and conservative business suits.
	   ``Today's drug trafficker shelters himself in very small, subtle
organizations,'' Colombia's national police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano, said in an interview. ``He doesn't go around anymore in
fancy sneakers, with Rolex watch, gold chains and a revolver on his
belt.''
	   The vast majority of today's traffickers in Colombia are virtual
unknowns. But they are efficient, U.S. and Colombian officials
agree. The flow of cocaine out of the world's leading producer
nation, estimated at 500 metric tons a year, has not ebbed.
	   Nor has business declined for Mexican drug lords, who have also
adopted a quieter, more business-like style in recent months. One
example is the Arellano Felix gang in Tijuana. Once known for
violence and high visibility, the Arellano Felix brothers are no
longer spotted in the upscale Tijuana nightclubs they once
frequented.
	   The shift is more evident in Colombia, however, where the
business has become more diffuse.
	   Gone are the days of the big drug cartels _ conglomerates that
controlled the business each step of the way from crop cultivation
to cocaine production in secret labs to sales on U.S. streets.
	   ``This is more like after the breakup of AT and T. Now you have
the Baby Bells,'' said a U.S. Embassy official, speaking on
condition he not be quoted by name. ``Notwithstanding, there's
still a lot of dope out there.''
	   And it keeps moving into new markets _ Russia, South Africa and
Japan are now in vogue.
	   Colombia's retooled cocaine trade is once again concentrated in
Medellin, the city that the late Pablo Escobar made murderously
notorious but was always a model of commercial efficiency.
Authorities have identified 43 trafficking gangs in Colombia,
nearly half of them in Medellin.
	   Each has an average of 10 to 20 associates, compared to the
hundreds of people who were on the payrolls of the old cartels.
	   ``They are mostly people between the ages of 25 and 40 who have
no criminal records and work through legitimate small businesses,''
said a Colombian police intelligence official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Some of the Medellin traffickers are former Escobar lieutenants,
but most are sophisticated newcomers who employ the latest
technologies, are Internet savvy, have a keen grasp of global
finance and are deft money launderers.
	   Colombia's first generation of traffickers, the ``cocaine
cowboys'' typified by Escobar, trained legions of young assassins,
kept mounds of cash in wicker baskets and concentrated operations
in specific regions. Flaunting their wealth and defying
authorities, they went down in flames in the early 1990s after
waging a war on the state that killed hundreds.
	   The successor Cali cartel fared well for a while, bribing police
officers, judges, journalists and politicians to look the other way
while hiding behind an intricate web of legitimate businesses like
its Drogas la Rebaja pharmacy chain.
	   But with the help of U.S. agents and intelligence, political
pressure from Washington and a police anti-corruption purge by
Serrano, brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez and the rest of the
Cali cartel's pinstripe-suited principals were caught beginning in
1995, convicted and jailed.
	   The new generation remains discreet, and harder to infiltrate.
	   ``We know of very important traffickers in Medellin who don't
even have cellular phones or beepers. They know that makes things
difficult for us,'' said a police intelligence official.
	   Witness to the self-destructiveness of the Medellin-Cali
rivalry, today's Colombian traffickers tend to collaborate rather
than compete. They sometimes pool resources, but are autonomous.
And they work equally with right-wing paramilitary groups and
leftist rebels, both of whom earn tens of millions of dollars a
year from cocaine production.
	   Medellin's main drug bosses _ nine are identified in an April 1
intelligence report by Colombia's equivalent of the FBI obtained by
The Associated Press _ allegedly include a major shareholder in a
local soccer team and Carlos Castano, a fugitive paramilitary
leader who lives in a northern mountain hideout.
	   ``The business is more dispersed. They don't send seven tons
like before, but 100 kilos or 50 kilos at a time because that way
it's much more difficult to identify the organization,'' Serrano
said.
	   The new traffickers are also less inclined to violence than
their predecessors, although they have killed six judicial
investigators in Medellin over the past year, riddling one with 23
bullets from a submachine gun, said a senior judicial official,
requesting anonymity for security reasons.

	   ``At the moment they're controlling Medellin's bands of
assassins,'' he said, referring to the professionals trained by
Escobar, who was killed by police in 1993.
	   The laboratories used to process cocaine also reflect the new
order.
	   ``They are smaller and, although their production can still be
high, there is less accumulation of product than before, and their
location is better concealed,'' said Col. Leonardo Gallego, chief
of Colombia's anti-narcotics police.
	   Today's traffickers still use small planes and speedboats to get
cocaine, and increasingly heroin, to transshipment points in the
Caribbean and Central America. But they are relying more and more
on couriers known as ``mules,'' many of them foreigners recruited
in Europe and Africa.
	   They still do a lot of business with Mexican cartels, but some
now bypass those costly middlemen. And cocaine distributors in the
United States are increasingly independent, acquiring drugs from a
variety of sources.
	   Colombian smugglers also keep inventing new ways of eluding the
law. The latest is black cocaine, a mixture of the drug with iron
dust and charcoal that fools both sniffer dogs and the standard
chemical detection test.
	   After German police first identified the substance with the
seizure of 15 kilograms (33 pounds) in March, Colombian
investigators tracked down the shippers and found 115 kilograms
(250 pounds) at Bogota's airport. It was in barrels labeled
industrial pigment and was waiting to be shipped by air to the
African nation of Togo via the Netherlands.
	   Experts said that once it reaches its destination, the cocaine
in black cocaine can be separated out with a simple solvent like
acetone. The extra steps add to the cost of smuggling, but the ploy
gives the gangs a new edge.
	   Rafael Parra, who heads the Colombia office of Interpol, the
global police agency, said black cocaine ``marks a new chapter in
the history of drug trafficking: substances being developed to mask
the drug.''

`Smurfing': How Colombians minimize risks of money laundering
</HEADLINE>
  With FEA-Colombia-The New Narcos

  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Traffickers in the cocaine trade's
Andean base bring home an estimated dlrs 5 billion a year earned
from selling the drug in the United States.
	   Among the schemes they use to hide the money trail is
``smurfing.'' Here's how it works:
	   _The gangs amass U.S. dollars from drug sales in ``stash
houses'' in the United States, then hire black market currency
brokers to convert the dollars into Colombian pesos.
	   _The brokers hire people in the United States to open checking
accounts at U.S. banks with small deposits. One broker can employ
dozens of people, who are known as ``smurfs'' after the diminutive
blue cartoon characters.
	   _The smurfs are given cash from the ``stash houses'' to deposit
into the ``shell'' checking accounts. Those amounts rarely exceed
the dlrs 10,000 limit that U.S. banks are required to report to the
Treasury Department.
	   _The smurfs sign sheafs of blank checks and give them to the
brokers, who fill in dollar amounts but leave payee names blank.
	   _Businesses in Colombia that need U.S. dollars to import goods
buy the checks from the currency brokers with Colombian pesos, fill
in the payee's name, and cash the checks. The businesses then ship
or smuggle the goods _ most often computers, cars, appliances,
liquor and cigarettes _ into Colombia.
	   _The brokers, after taking their cut, turn the pesos over to the
drug traffickers in Colombia.
	   Variations on the scheme include the drug gangs using their
dollars to buy goods such as computers in the United States and
then smuggling them into Colombia to be sold for pesos.
	   However, traffickers are able to repatriate only about half of
their earnings through such means, Colombian and U.S. law
enforcement officials say. They believe the traffickers are
channeling the rest, billions of dollars, into the world's stock,
bond and futures markets.
	   Colombia has had a money-laundering law since 1995 and it was
applied in the arrest of a bank manager in Cali. But no one has yet
been convicted under the statute.
	   Last month, U.S. authorities announced the arrest of Mexican and
Venezuelan bankers in what was described as the largest drug-money
laundering case in U.S. history.
	   But while Washington said ``Operation Casablanca'' had exposed
links between the arrested bankers and Colombian traffickers,
police sources here said the effect on this country's drug gangs
was likely minimal.

Money laundering case shows difficulty of international
</HEADLINE>
cooperation  
  With FEA-The New Narcos  
  By KEN GUGGENHEIM  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ To the United States, it was a major blow to
money launderers. To Mexico, it was a giant violation of its
sovereignty.
	   ``Operation Casablanca,'' the three-year U.S. money laundering
sting that led to 160 indictments last month, has highlighted a
sensitive issue in multinational criminal investigations: balancing
a need for secrecy while respecting foreign laws.
	   As officials from some 150 nations _ President Clinton and
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo among them _ meet beginning
Monday at the United Nations to develop a common strategy for
combating drugs, the fallout from the case shows how difficult that
cooperation can be.
	   Mexican officials from Zedillo on down have expressed anger over
revelations that U.S. undercover agents investigating the
laundering of drug money had operated in Mexican territory without
their knowledge. They say they will try to extradite the agents for
trial.
	   Clinton's spokesman, Mike McCurry, said Clinton expressed regret
to Zedillo that ``prior consultations had not been possible.'' But
while U.S. officials said they were looking at how the case was
handled, they also defended the tight secrecy as necessary to
protect informants and agents.
	   Both Clinton and Zedillo seemed unaware Mexico had been informed
in 1996 that the investigation was taking place _ a fact the
Mexican attorney general's office conceded Wednesday. But it
insisted Mexican officials had not authorized U.S. agents ``to
carry out actions on national territory.''
	   In the case of Mexico, U.S. law enforcement agencies tend to be
particularly wary of sharing secrets. Longstanding fears of
corruption were compounded when Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus
Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested in 1997 and charged with being on
the payroll of Mexico's top drug smuggler.
	   ``The bottom line is anything you share with the Mexican
government as it pertains to narcotics trafficking will immediately
be found in the hands of the narcotics organizations in Mexico,''
said Phil Jordan, the former head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's intelligence center in El Paso, Texas.
	   Generally, when investigations lead to Mexico, DEA agents try to
find trustworthy Mexican counterparts to work with. But in some
rare cases _ when a major operation may be compromised or an
agent's life endangered _ U.S. agents have worked in Mexico without
the Mexican government's knowledge, Jordan said.
	   ``It's something you have to weigh at the time,'' he said.
	   For Mexico, ``Operation Casablanca'' was only the latest example
of the United States arrogantly violating its sovereignty. It
considers the U.S. policy of ``certifying'' other nations'
anti-drug efforts as hypocrisy on the part of the world's largest
drug-consuming nation.
	   Mexicans also were outraged when U.S.-paid agents in 1990
kidnapped a doctor suspected in the killing of an undercover U.S.
drug agent and took him to the United States for trial.
	   U.S.-Mexico drug cooperation had seemed to be improving. In a
visit to Mexico in August, Clinton's top adviser on drugs, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, praised Mexican law enforcement. And last Tuesday,
Mexican officials announced the arrest of two brothers believed to
be top leaders of Mexico's largest methamphetamine cartel.
	   Even with the anger over ``Casablanca,'' both Mexican and U.S.
officials continue to stress the need to work together in the fight
against drugs.
	   At a briefing to discuss the U.N. anti-drug conference, Mexico's
foreign secretary, Rosario Green, focused more on the need for
nations to work together to fight narcotics than on criticism of
the sting.
	   Among the top issues for Mexico at the conference: declarations
establishing international principles against money laundering
``stressing the need for a wide exchange of information and, of
course, for respecting sovereignty and territorial jurisdictions,''
Green said.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian warplanes bombed an air force
base outside Asmara, then were shot down by anti-aircraft guns,
bringing the border dispute between the two East African nations
right to Eritrea's capital.
	   Ethiopian MiG-23s bombed two hangars Friday at an air base
outside Asmara next to the international airport. A commercial
airliner on the tarmac was reported damaged. Eritrean guns then
shot the two jets down.
	   Witnesses saw several injured people being transported in
trucks, but it was not immediately possible to determine the number
of casualties or the fate of the Ethiopian pilots.
	   The escalating conflict prompted the State Department to order
nonessential staff out of Eritrea and urge other Americans to
leave. A plane flew out Friday with 122 Americans and 70 other
foreigners, mostly Britons and Canadians, the State Department
said. Peace Corp volunteers also were evacuated.
	   Evacuation flights were being planned for Saturday by Britain,
the United Nations and the European Union. Eritrea and Ethiopia are
at odds over a border region that is claimed by both sides.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the Foreign Ministry said
the bombing was in retaliation for an Eritrean attack on Mekele,
200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Addis, on Friday that wounded
five Ethiopians.
	   Ethiopian sources said fighting continued for a third day Friday
around the border town of Zala Ambassa, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Mekele, where both sides traded tank, artillery and
mortar fire. Ethiopian fighters attacked Eritrean tanks that were
moving toward Adigrat, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) west.
	   Both nations _ two of the world's poorest _ used aircraft, tanks
and artillery supplied to Ethiopia by the Soviet Union during the
Cold War.
	   The attacks came a day after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi agreed to a proposal put forth by the United States and
Rwanda to end the two countries' border conflict peacefully.
	   But Meles warned that his country's patience with Eritrea was
wearing thin because of Eritrea's refusal to withdraw from
territory Ethiopia claims it occupied a month ago.
	   The Eritrean government issued a statement Friday saying there
were ``still serious issues of detail and implementation to be
worked out'' with the proposal.
	   Jubilant Eritreans poured into the streets of Asmara waving the
blue, green and red flags of their young nation after the Ethiopian
fighters were shot down.
	   The State Department urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease all
hostilities while outside envoys seek a peaceful resolution of the
dispute.
	   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council on
Friday called for an immediate cease-fire and Secretary-General
Kofi Annan appealed to both sides to ``give diplomacy a chance.''
	   ``The Security Council deplored this escalation and called for
an immediate cease-fire'' and ``urged Eritrea and Ethiopia to
affirm their commitment to resolve the dispute peacefully,''
council President Antonio Monteiro of Portugal said.
	   One of the recommendations of the U.S.-Rwandan proposal was that
Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, has
always claimed it remains inside its own territory as determined by
Italian colonial boundaries.
	   Eritrean rebels under the command of President Isaias Afwerki
were instrumental in helping Meles' Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime
in July 1991.

20 years after lifting priesthood ban, Mormon church flourishes in
</HEADLINE>
Africa

  By MATTHEW BROWN  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Jomo Oludipe is a Nigerian immigrant who
joined the Mormon church in 1991 and now heads a mainly black
congregation in Washington, D.C.
	   He's seen many changes in the church that had excluded blacks
from the clergy until two decades ago. And he foresees even more,
in ``God's time.''
	   Someday, he believes a top Mormon leader visiting West African
congregations will don colorful native dress instead of a business
suit and hear hymns backed by African drums, a musical
accompaniment forbidden by church elders now.
	   ``It has nothing to do with spirituality, it is just what we are
used to,'' Oludipe said.
	   Mormonism, a faith founded in New York that grew among mainly
white settlers in the American West, has been rethinking its views
on race and inclusiveness for 20 years now.
	   On June 8, 1978, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
lifted its 126-year-old ban on blacks entering the priesthood.
Spencer W. Kimball, then church president, explained the next day
that he had received a revelation that all worthy males over age 11
could be ordained to the lay priesthood, regardless of race.
	   Since that watershed, Mormonism has blossomed in Africa with
112,000 members in 27 countries. And while membership records don't
indicate race, anecdotal evidence suggests increasing numbers of
black conversions in America as well.
	   ``As we leave the West ... and become a more global church with
global involvement with cultures around the world, then we have to
more carefully think through what is cultural and what is essential
doctrine,'' said Alexander B. Morrison, a member of the First
Quorum of the Seventy, a body that advises the church hierarchy.
	   ``How to define that,'' he acknowledged, ``is not an easy
task.''
	   Mormonism is by nature a centralized, top-down organization, its
leader ordained as a prophet and seer, but Morrison said the church
is trying to reach out and to listen. Earlier this year, Gordon B.
Hinckley became the first church president to visit the Mormon
faithful in West Africa.
	   The Mormon church, with 10 million members, is not alone in
trying to balance the various cultures within its membership. Even
so, it has lagged behind some other mainstream Christian
denominations.
	   Some call Mormonism's past refusal to allow blacks to as priests
merely a reflection of the times, and yet it was the only major
religion attempting to theologically justify it, said Jan Shipps,
professor emeritus of history and religious studies at
Indiana-Purdue University, Indianapolis.
	   Joseph Smith, who founded the church in 1830, is said to have
ordained a black man. It was Smith's successor, pioneer leader
Brigham Young, who as early as 1852 turned into policy the notion
that blacks were cursed and inferior.
	   Over the decades, Mormon theologians attempted to explain the
policy by using the Bible and other scriptures to prove blacks were
tainted by unrighteousness in a pre-mortal life.
	   ``You talk to any black and they know,'' said David Jackson, a
black Mormon living in Orange County, Calif. ``I had one guy I was
trying to get involved in the church and he said, `You know, Dave,
the Mormons are wonderful people until you find out what they
really believe about us.'''
	   Jackson, who said Mormonism's strict moral standards and
organization are attractive to many blacks, is part of a group
pleading for the church to publicly repudiate its ``racist
legacy.''
	   In response, church leaders recently issued a statement saying
the 1978 revelation speaks for itself.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's not clear in my mind,'' said
Doris Backey, a black Mormon in Menlo Park, California. ``I know
that God loves me and I decided not to question (God's) integrity
because there must have been a time and place for all things.''
	   Backey, who had been a missionary with another Christian
denomination, did not win early acceptance among Mormons. Some in
the staid, upper-class congregation she worships with near Stanford
University saw her as disruptive when she would belt out a
boisterous, soulful solo or occasionally holler ``amen'' during
services.
	   ``I asked her once if she was being treated well and she told me
that if people don't, then that's their problem,'' said fellow
Mormon and friend Joleen Steck. ``But they've learned to adore
her.... They now ask her to sing at weddings and funerals.''
	   Morrison said local lay leaders who oversee the congregations
are urged to consider church members as individuals.
	   ``We don't get to heaven in groups or cultures,'' he said. ``We
get there one by one.''

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Saying the drug war has caused more harm
than drug abuse itself, prominent world figures are calling for ``a
truly open dialogue'' to shift drug control policies from
punishment to public health issues.
	   The call is being made in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan from the Lindesmith Center, a private institute which
conducts drug research, in advance of the U.N. General Assembly
special session on drugs, which opens Monday.
	   Dr. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the center, said the letter has
been signed by more than 500 prominent people, including former
Secretary of State George Shultz, former Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, former Greek President George Papandreou, former
President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and former German Justice
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.
	   ``We believe that the global war on drugs is now causing more
harm than drug abuse itself,'' the letter said. ``Human rights are
violated, environmental assaults perpetrated and prisons inudated
with hundreds of thousands of drug violators.''
	   The letter said scarce resources are being diverted ``on ever
more expensive interdiction efforts'' while ``realistic proposals
to reduce drug-related crime, disease and death'' are abandoned
``in favor of rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.''
	   It appealed to Annan ``to initiate a truly open and honest
dialogue regarding the future of global drug policies _ one in
which fear, prejudice and punitive prohibitions yield to common
sense, science, public health and human rights.''
	   Nadelmann said the U.N. conference should consider the global
drug policy as a public heath issue, using the resources of U.N.
agencies such as the World Health Organization to devise policies
to replace those based on ``interdiction and criminalization.''
	   Representatives of about 150 countries, including 35 heads of
state and government, are to attend the three-day conference.
President Clinton will deliver the opening address Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban on Friday condemned a
U.N. invitation to followers of ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani to attend the drug conference.
	   The Taliban army drove Rabbani from the capital Kabul in 1996
and now controls about 85 percent of the country. Rabbani's
northern-based alliance controls about 15 percent of the territory
and has been battling the Taliban.
	   However, Afghanistan's U.N. seat remains in the hands of the
previous government pending a final decision.

British newspapers criticize Al Fayed's remarks about Diana's
</HEADLINE>
mother  
  With Diana-Investigation  

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Several of Britain's national newspapers reacted
Saturday with anger at critical remarks made about Princess Diana's
mother by Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the same Paris
car crash that killed the princess.
	   Al Fayed said Friday that Frances Shand Kydd was ``a bad
mother,'' accused her of ``snobbery'' and said her daughter Diana
``did not give a damn about her.''
	   The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling daily tabloid, called Al
Fayed a ``heartless creep.'' The newspaper then said in an
editorial that Al Fayed was an ``ill-mannered self-seeker with no
regard for decency.''
	   ``Fayed Savages Diana's Mother,'' said the headline in the Daily
Mail, the country's top selling mid-market tabloid.
	   Al Fayed, multi-millionaire owner of the Hotel Ritz in Paris and
the Harrods department store in London, made his outburst after he
and Mrs. Shand Kydd joined others to attend a court meeting in
Paris called by French judge Judge Herve Stephan. The judge is
investigating the Aug. 31 crash in the French capital's Pont de
l'Alma tunnel which claimed the lives of Diana, Dodi Fayed, and
chauffeur Henri Paul.
	   Al Fayed said he was offended that Shand Kydd refused to speak
to him at the hearing.
	   ``I'm an ordinary person. I'm a working-class guy,'' Al Fayed
said. ``She thinks she's the Queen of Sheba. She didn't talk to
me.''
	   Al Fayed's outburst made the front pages of almost all of
Britain's national newspapers. Only The Financial Times, and The
Mirror, a tabloid which has extensively carried Al Fayed's claims
that the crash that killed Diana and Dodi was not an accident, did
not carry the story on its front page in early editions Saturday.
Several papers carried critical editorials.
	   The Express, a mid-market tabloid, said in an editorial that Al
Fayed had been responsible for upsetting both Diana's children and
her wider family by pursuing conspiracy theories surrounding her
death. Tests showed that chauffeur Paul was drunk at the time of
the crash, and French investigators believe that is likely the main
cause of the crash, in addition to high speed.
	   ``Condemned by government inspectors as a liar, paranoid in his
conspiracy theories and a persistent attention seeker, he is in
danger of becoming one of the most odious men in Britain,'' The
Express said of Al Fayed. ``Morally and personally repugnant to
many, we hope he is never given British citizenship.''
	   Egyptian-born Al Fayed has had a strained relationship with
Britain, his adopted country. Successive British governments have
refused to give him citizenship, in part because a government
report into his takeover of a department store chain in the 1980s
concluded that he had misrepresented his background.
	   Al Fayed's ``tenacity makes many observers feel queasy,'' wrote
The Independent, a liberal broadsheet, ``for it appears to form
just another stage in Mr. Fayed's long battle with the
establishment. Any weapon will do, it seems, even the death of his
beloved son.''

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Just days after being cut from
Brazil's national team, Romario surpassed his physical therapist's
expectations and appeared on Brazilian television kicking a soccer
ball around a sand box Friday.
	   ``Romario is much better than I had imagined,'' Nilton Petroni
was quoted in O Globo newspaper. ``He wasn't supposed to go the
sand box today but he felt so good after a work session this
morning that we upped the training schedule.''
	   Petroni's office declined to comment to The Associated Press.
	   Romario returned from France earlier this week after tests
showed he had not recovered sufficiently from a muscle injury in
his leg.
	   ___  
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Brazil's World Cup veterans are
unanimous in calling unity the key to winning the tournament. But
don't expect Edmundo to join in.
	   The temperamental forward of Italy's Fiorentina has jarred the
harmony of the group with his repeated complaints about teammates
and his own status as a benchwarmer. With a history of causing
uproars, Edmundo is known as ``the animal.''
	   Edmundo struck again on Friday. In an interview with a Rio de
Janeiro radio station, he said he felt he deserved to get the
starting berth opened with the loss of Romario, who was cut from
the squad with a calf injury. Instead, the spot went to Bebeto.
	   ``I thought the spot would be mine because I think that today
I'm in better physical and technical shape and overall I'm better
than Bebeto _ without causing any polemic,'' Edmundo said.
	   ___  
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ For two of Denmark's top players,
Friday's friendly against Cameroon had something special: Michael
Laudrup said farewell to his fans at home after 16 years on the
team and Peter Schmeichel marked his 100th game in goal.
	   Laudrup, who also played on Denmark's 1986 World Cup side in
Mexico, announced in May he will retire from soccer at age 33 after
the World Cup finals.
	   Cheered by some 37,000 fans at the national Parken stadium in
Copenhagen, a visibly moved Laudrup, making his 98th appearance,
kicked off his last game on Danish soil while supporters chanted
``Michael, Michael.''
	   His professional career took him to European powerhouses like
Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Ajax Amsterdam.
	   One of the world's top keepers, Manchester United's Schmeichel
is the second Dane to reach the magic figure. Of the 100 games, he
has managed to keep the ball out of the net 46 times.
	   Schmeichel and Laudrup likely will beat former international
Morten Olsen's record of 102 games as both been selected for the
World Cup.
	   ___  
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Like a fighter who's been knocked out
in the first round seven times in a row, Scotland's soccer team
will celebrate if they finally reach round two of the World Cup.
	   ``We have a great chance to make history, and the boys know
that. We have got to dispel the notion of being brave losers,''
coach Craig Brown said Friday as the team departed for France ahead
of the June 10 opening game against defending titlist Brazil.
	   ``We will really be at the highest level,'' he added. ``We are
one of 30 teams who have qualified to join the hosts and holders.
	   ``There are some 142 countries who have not made it, like
Portugal and Sweden. We are there and viewed as one of the
underdogs, which is fine by us.''
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gottfried Dienst, who controversially awarded
England's third goal in the 1966 World Cup final with the Germans
protesting the ball hadn't crossed the line, has died after a short
illness.
	   The Swiss referee's decision became part of World Cup history
when Geoff Hurst's injury-time shot hit the underside of the
crossbar, bounced down and out into play.
	   English players celebrated a goal and the Germans ran to
linesman Tofik Bakhramov to protest. Dienst ran to the linesman
too, awarded the goal, England then led 3-2 and finally won 4-2.

Guns and grapes as U.S. soccer team arrives in France

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ For many tourists, France
is a land of grapes and cheese, the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de
Triomphe.
	   When the U.S. soccer team arrived in Lyon on Friday, players
came off a plane to find an airport filled with machine-gun toting
soldiers, pistol-armed police and a bomb-sniffing dog.
	   And when it arrived later in this tiny Beaujolais village, where
the team will spend most of the next three weeks, there were
gendarmerie patrolling the vineyards, plainclothes officers
strolling among the roosters and geese, and dogs ready to attack
upon command.
	   ``I don't know, man, Dana Point is looking nice right now,''
forward Eric Wynalda said, thinking back to the Southern California
beach resort where the Americans spent most of the 1994 tournament.
	   Satolas Airport looked like a militarized zone when the
Americans arrived shortly before noon on a chartered plane after
the Air France pilots' strike led to cancellation of their original
flight.
	   Officials allowed French people to greet the team inside the
terminal, but three dozen Americans who came to cheer their team
were forced to wait outside behind barriers.
	   About two dozen French children in red warmup suits with the
name of a World Cup sponsor were brought inside for the official
greeting while the somewhat peeved American fans tried to catch the
team's attention as players walked to the bus.
	   ``How about the American kids?'' yelled Bob Kennedy of
Greenwich, Conn., head of the American Club of Lyon.
	   After seeing the U.S. fans, some players and coach Steve Sampson
walked over to the barriers, handed out team pictures and spent
about 10 minutes signing autographs.
	   Four soldiers with machine guns surveyed the crowd from the
second floor of the terminal, and uniformed and plain-clothes
police surrounded the team below.
	   Four years ago, when the World Cup was in the United States for
the first time, no weapons were visible when the U.S. team
traveled, only private security guards. Still, the police presence
was less that for the 1990 tournament in Italy, where every player
was shadowed by a Carabinieri paramiliatary officer with a
9-millimeter Beretta machine gun.
	   Players took all the security in stride.
	   ``You don't notice unless you look at it,'' midfielder Chad
Deering said.
	   Officials hung American flags late Wednesday and Thursday,
making it look like Flag Day in Saint-Jean D'Ardieres, a village of
1,200 near the Soane River. When the U.S. players worked out Friday
night at Stade Marcel Giroud, the newly sodded field of the local
amateur team, they were greeted by ``The Star-Spangled Banner,''
blared from a speaker on the balcony of an apartment complex next
to the field.
	   While weary from the long overnight flight from New York _
players sat in the back of the coach section _ the team was happy
to finally arrive for soccer's biggest tournament. Players weren't
happy with their isolated location, but Sampson told them they
would be able to head into Lyons, which is about an hour's drive
south, and perhaps could go north to Burgundy.
	   ``It's got the atmosphere we were looking for, the history,''
Sampson said at the team hotel, Chateau de Pizay, a 12th century
castle surrounded by a 130-acre vineyard and a 75-acre oak forest.
``It allows player to focus without a lot of distraction.''

Sorenstam tops in St. Louis _ again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam, overcoming rainy weather that
transformed one of her favorite courses, shot a 5-under-par 67 on
Friday for a one-stroke, first-round lead of the weather-shortened
LPGA Michelob Light Classic.
	   Sorenstam, who won the 1995 tournament by 10 strokes and won
again in 1997, is searching for her first victory of 1998 after
winning six tournaments and over dlrs 1.2 million last year.
	   Rain washed out the first round on Thursday, which reduced the
tournament to 54 holes. Wet, cool weather also caused a 2 1/2-hour
delay in the start of Friday's round over the Forest Hills Country
Club course.
	   ``I love to come here knowing I play well,'' Sorenstam said. ``I
come out on the first tee and I know where to hit it. It's almost
like you have a home course when you play well. That really helps
me here.''
	   One stroke behind Sorenstam was Caroline McMillan, whose 68 was
the only over sub-70 round. Penny Hammel, Stephanie Lowe and Laurie
Rinker-Graham shot 70s.
	   Amateur Maria Baena, one of four players unable to finish, was
3-under through 16 holes.
	   Hammel said that course was completely different on Friday than
it was earlier in the week.
	   ``When we came out Wednesday, I just couldn't imagine this
course being that hard and that fast,'' Hammel said. ``I wasn't
used to it. So, when I woke up yesterday, I was kind like, `All
right, it's back to its normal self.' I was kind of happy to see
the rain.''
	   ``It is really different from playing Wednesday, because it was
really dry and the ball was rolling a lot,'' Sorenstam said.
``Today, it was just the opposite. You hit a shot and it sticks in
your pitch mark.''
	   Sorenstam took charge immediately by making a birdie putt on the
par-4 first hole.
	   ``I told my caddie, `It's one of those good days,''' Sorenstam
said. ``You make that first one and it gets you going.''
	   After three-putting the par-4, fourth hole, Sorenstam recorded
four birdies in succession from the fifth through the eighth hole.
She went out in 4-under 32.
	   Cindy Figg-Currier, among a half-dozen players who shot 71, has
seen that before here.
	   ``I'm sure Annika is very comfortable and likes this,'' she
said. `` I played with her here last year, and 20-footers (8
meters) to her were like 3-footers (0.9 meters) to the rest of
us.''
	   That has not been the case this year. Sorenstam, who birdied the
11th hole on the back side and parred out the rest of the way, said
her putting has been her downfall all year.
	   ``I'm really happy with the way I played today, especially the
way I putted. I think I have been hitting the ball really well the
whole year, I just haven't made any putts. Today, I made some, and
that's what you need.''
	   The Forest Hills course usually favors accuracy over distance,
but Hammel said the longer hitters now have an advantage again.
	   ``It definitely favors the longer players, because they carry it
farther,'' she said. ``Shorter players like myself rely on a lot of
roll, but you're not getting any roll out there.''
	   Thursday's rainout was the first in five years of the event,
although play was suspended in the second round last year due to
rain. The cut will now come Saturday after 36 holes.
	   One player who is already out of contention is Janice Gibson.
After carding a 38 on the back nine to start her round, Gibson was
disqualified for violating Rule 15-3 when she played a ball from
out of bounds on the par-3 No. 3 hole.

Malaysian King: Don't let `foreign powers' dictate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ While warning Malaysians not to
allow ``foreign powers'' to subjugate their nation, Malaysia's king
exhorted his people to remain civil toward each other during these
troubling times.
	   In his birthday speech televised live late Friday, Yang
Di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar said foreigners were out to use
their economic clout to ``cripple'' developing nations such as
Malaysia and retard their economic progress.
	   He exhorted Malaysians to remain united.
	   ``This is not the time for the people to give up hope and to let
foreign powers dictate the fate of the nation,'' the king said.
	   Since Asia's economic crisis began last July, Malaysia has seen
its currency, the ringgit, plunge more than 35 percent against the
dollar.
	   That led to heated comments by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
who blamed foreign currency speculators for rupturing the ringgit
and precipitating an exodus of foreign funds.
	   This in turn caused even more skittish foreign investors to pull
out.
	   In his speech, however, the king reiterated his support for
Mahathir's leadership and affirmed the premier's ability to help
the country's economy recover.
	   ``I am very much satisfied with all the efforts being undertaken
by the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister,'' he
said.
	   The king also said Malaysians must also do their part _ by
spending less and saving more _ to help increase national savings
and bolster the country's foreign reserves.
	   ``Now it is not the time for us to be selfish,'' he said. ``We
should be helping each other to go through the current hard times
as we'll only be a strong society if we are all united.''

Mania over Nomo moves to new coast
</HEADLINE>
  By HOWARD ULMAN  
  AP Sports Writer  

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ New team, same Nomo-mania.
	   From the media to his manager to Mike Piazza, the pitcher with
the 2-7 record and 5.05 ERA stirred excitement on his first day in
a New York Mets uniform.
	   Even Mookie Wilson, a Mets coach, wore a bemused smile as he sat
in the dugout watching 10 minicams focused on the empty runway from
the clubhouse for more than 15 minutes waiting for Hideo Nomo to
come out.
	   ``It's a little weird right now,'' Wilson said Friday night.
	   Nomo was traded late Thursday night by the Los Angeles Dodgers,
ending his successful career on the West Coast where he was very
popular among Asian fans. On the East Coast, he's reunited with
Piazza, who was traded May 22 to the Mets by Florida, which got him
from the Dodgers seven days earlier.
	   ``We think he's going to contribute a lot to this ballclub. It's
going to be a lot of fun,'' Piazza said before the game with the
Boston Red Sox.
	   ``His pitching speaks for itself,'' manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``I like his competitiveness. He's a tough cookie.''
	   Nomo showed up in the Mets' clubhouse 2 hours and 15 minutes
before the game and quietly shook hands with Valentine. Then Dave
Wallace, his former pitching coach with the Dodgers and now an
adviser to Mets general manager Steve Phillips, saw him.
	   ``Who's the new guy?'' Wallace said with a laugh. Then they
embraced.
	   During batting practice, Nomo stayed in the outfield while
Piazza got more attention from fans.
	   It was Nomo, however, who drew so much attention that he had to
conduct his 11-minute, pregame news conference while sitting on top
of the Mets dugout, legs dangling off the edge and five policemen
in the stands behind him to keep fans away.
	   In front were a dozen minicams, six boom mikes and a horde of
reporters pressing against each other. The Red Sox received
requests from 16 media outlets, including some from Japan, after
the trade was announced.
	   And Nomo won't even be pitching until Tuesday at home against
Tampa Bay.
	   Speaking through an interpreter, Nomo had nothing but good words
for the latest upheaval in his life, starting with the Dodgers
designating him for assignment Monday, which gave them 10 days to
make a move.
	   ``I needed a change of scenery,'' he said. ``I'm just glad this
trade was finalized as quickly as it was.''
	   He wore a black Mets jacket with the number 16, Dwight Gooden's
old number with the club, on his left sleeve. He joins a team that
started the day in second place in the National League East with a
31-23 record, third best in the wild-card race.
	   Nomo, 29, also was reunited with pitcher Masato Yoshii, a
teammate with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan.
	   Nomo was one of baseball's best pitchers as a rookie in 1995
after signing as a free agent after five seasons in his native
Japan. He was the NL's rookie of the year and led the league in
strikeouts. Going into this season, he had a 43-29 record and 3.34
ERA. But he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow
last fall and has struggled recently, losing his last four
decisions while allowing 18 earned runs in 26 2-3 innings.

U.S.-Brazil play in semifinal of Women's World Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ After watching his unbeaten team lose to the
United States by 36 points, Russian coach Yevgeny Gomelsky was
convinced.
	   ``There is no real opponent for the Americans. No one can defeat
the U.S. team, and they will surely win the world championship,''
Gomelsky said.
	   Those who watched the Americans struggle to get past Japan in
the first game of the World Championships in Karlsruhe had to
wonder if Gomelsky was talking about the same U.S. team. That team,
which barely beat the ninth-place finisher in the championships,
looked helpless against the zone, couldn't handle switches and
seemed vulnerable to any team with quickness and a plan.
	   What happened? Why are the Americans now the heavy favorites to
beat Brazil in the semifinals Saturday and, the next day take the
gold _ which they last won in 1990?''
	   It starts with talent. The Americans may not have the most
talented starting five in the tournament, though many might argue
that they do, but they definitely have the deepest roster.
	   ``It is very difficult to defense this team,'' said Slovakian
coach Natalia Hejkova. ``They have 12 very good players.''
	   That may be true, but U.S. coach Nell Fortner really only uses
10 and they all contribute.
	   ``Our depth definitely came into play last night,'' Fortner said
about the 89-62 win over Slovakia in the first round of the
single-elimination finals.
	   Both Natalie Williams and Lisa Leslie, who have been the dynamos
in the American attack, got into early foul trouble _ so Fortner
brought in DeLisha Milton and Chamique Holdsclaw, and the U.S.
juggernaut kept rolling.
	   Another factor in the American resurgence has been a simple one:
familiarity. Only five players in Germany played on the team that
won the Olympic gold medal in 1996, and this is Fortner's first
major competition as head coach.
	   Fortner only had from March 18 to mold these 12 players into a
team, and it took some time for all the parts to mesh.
	   That zone attack that looked so helpless against Japan now
produces open looks and layups because, Fortner said, the team has
finally run it enough against live competition to get comfortable
with it. Even so, the Americans have faced a zone only in about
eight games, which still causes some problems.
	   ``The hardest thing is get people cutting and moving,'' said
Fortner, but in the last few games, it hasn't mattered much what
defense has faced the U.S.
	   At the other end of the floor, the Americans have made
adjustments too _ and many of them are simply the result of more
familiarity with the system. Fortner has installed a few simple
rules about handling an on-ball screen, for example, but it takes
time for even experienced players to react instinctively to game
situations.
	   And finally, there is Fortner herself. The 39-year-old had only
one year of collegiate head coaching experience, though she had
assisted Tara VanDerveer on the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, so there
were questions about whether she was ready to run a team of elite
athletes playing at the highest level in the world.
	   ``She's been really positive with us, which has helped,'' said
Jennifer Azzi, the team captain and one of the five returnees from
the 1996 Olympic champions. ``Her game plans are really good.''
	   But Fortner has also helped mold this group of disparate
individuals into a real team, a fact noted by Spanish center
Elisabeth Cebrian when she was asked to compare the Americans to
the Russians.
	   ``The Russians have more technique,'' said Cebrian, ``but the
U.S. is more of a team.''

Cubs edge White Sox 6-5 as interleague play begins
</HEADLINE>
  Eds: will be updated  

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Brant Brown hit a leadoff home run in the 12th
inning to give the Cubs a 6-5 victory over the White Sox on Friday
in the first official Wrigley Field game between the Chicago
rivals.
	   The last time the two met at a Cubs park in a game that counted
was the 1906 World Series at West Side Grounds. The White Sox won
that series 4-2.
	   Brown hit his sixth homer of the season over the right-field
wall off Tony Castillo (1-2) to give the Cubs their seventh
straight victory. Terry Mulholland (2-1) allowed one hit in a
scoreless 12th for the victory.
	   The Cubs threatened in the 10th, loading the bases with one out,
but Matt Karchner struck out Sammy Sosa, who homered in the fifth,
and Jeff Blauser, who had three hits on the day.
  Pirates 6, Twins 1  
	   In Pittsburgh, Jermaine Allensworth hit a tiebreaking two-run
single and rookie Jose Silva pitched a five-hitter as Pittsburgh
won its sixth straight.
	   Silva (6-3) struck out seven and didn't walk any to win for the
fifth time in his last six decisions.
	   Minnesota's Mike Morgan (2-2) continued to struggle against
Pittsburgh, giving up eight hits and three runs in six innings.
Morgan, who has pitched for a record-tying 10 clubs, is 5-17
lifetime against the Pirates.
  Reds 2, Indians 1  
	   In Cincinnati, Pete Harnisch quieted a large Cleveland
contingent with seven strong innings and Bret Boone had four hits
as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Indians.
	   The Indians' first game in Cincinnati was a box-office smash _
the Reds sold 43,532 tickets, their best gate since opening day.
Thousands of fans made the four-hour drive from Cleveland, where
Jacobs Field is sold out for the season, to root for the visiting
team.
	   Harnisch (6-1) quieted the visitors' fans and set up Cleveland's
third loss in 11 games by allowing only four hits over seven
innings, including Jim Thome's solo homer in the sixth.
  Expos 5, Devil Rays 2  
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Brad Fullmer and Vladimir Guerrero
hit two-run homers as Montreal beat Tampa Bay in an interleague
matchup that drew the smallest crowd ever at Tropicana Field.
	   After averaging 31,396 in their first 26 home games, the
expansion Devil Rays drew only 24,025 for their first
regular-season game against a National League opponent.
	   Dustin Hermanson (4-4) pitched five shutout innings as Montreal
won its third consecutive road game. Tampa Bay has lost four in a
row.
  Orioles 3, Braves 2  
	   In Baltimore, Scott Erickson pitched a seven-hitter and
Baltimore hit three homers off Danny Neagle to beat Atlanta for the
fourth straight time since interleague play began last season.
	   The Orioles swept three games in Atlanta last year, and this
time they made quick work of the Braves in 1 hour, 53 minutes.
	   Eric Davis, Lenny Webster and Joe Carter homered off Neagle
(7-3), who had not given up three homers in a game this season.
That was enough offense for Erickson (6-6), who had won only two of
his last eight decisions.
  Mets 9, Red Sox 2  
	   In Boston, in their first meeting at Fenway Park since the 1986
World Series, the New York Mets hit four long homers off Pedro
Martinez to beat the Boston Red Sox.
	   The Mets welcomed pitcher Hideo Nomo, obtained Thursday night
from the Los Angeles Dodgers, but lost catcher Mike Piazza, who
sustained a contusion of his left hand after being hit by a pitch
in the first inning.
	   X-rays were negative and Piazza, who left the game after the top
of the first, was listed as day-to-day.
	   Martinez (6-2) had his worst outing of the season, giving up
400-foot plus homers to Alberto Castillo, John Olerud, Luis Lopez,
and Bernard Gilkey.

Security Council considers resolution against nuclear programs in
</HEADLINE>
South Asia  
  Eds: UPDATES with Indian letter denouncing council stand  
  By ROBERT H. REID  
  Associated Press Writer  

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in
South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution
urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and
denying nuclear status to the two rivals.
	   India accused the council of overstepping its authority and
questioned why the members were tolerating ``the continued
retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states,'' who
are all permanent members of the council.
	   In a letter to council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N.
ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved
``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which
the council has any role.''
	   Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to
ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for
elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council
members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
	   The draft resolution urges both countries to halt the
development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and
calls on them to sign nuclear arms control treaties.
	   It also asks India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and find
``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of those
tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   Japan pushed for quick council action on the resolution as a
followup to Thursday's meeting in Geneva of foreign ministers of
the five longtime nuclear states _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China.
	   Following the Geneva meeting, the five _ also permanent members
of the council _ condemned Indian and Pakistani tests and pledged
to cooperate closely ``to prevent a ``nuclear and missile arms race
in the subcontinent.''
	   Council diplomats continued closed-door consultations late
Friday trying to work out language acceptable to all 15 members _
especially the 10 non-permanent members who were not represented at
the Geneva meeting.
	   It was unclear whether the resolution, co-sponsored by Sweden
and Costa Rica, would be put to a vote Friday night or possibly
Saturday.
	   The draft resolution repeated the position of the five that
although India and Pakistan have exploded nuclear devices, they
would not be accorded status as nuclear states.
	   Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five
countries were the only ones allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals.
India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty, pointing to
that exemption as unfair.
	   The Japanese resolution also welcomed an offer by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to
resume a high-level dialogue which broke down last year because of
differences over Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of
them Kashmir which is divided between them.
	   The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the
export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''

Red Wings stop Stars 2-0 to advance to finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Stanley Cup will go through Detroit _ again.
	   Larry Murphy and Sergei Fedorov scored and Chris Osgood notched
his fifth career playoff shutout as the Red Wings defeated the
Dallas Stars 2-0 Friday night to wrap up the Western Conference
title in six games.
	   The defending Stanley Cup champions advanced to the finals for
the third time in four years. Detroit will open the best-of-7
championship series Tuesday night against the Eastern Conference
champion Washington Capitals at Joe Louis Arena.
	   The Stars won the Presidents' Trophy for having the best record
in the National Hockey League during the regular season (49-22-11),
and had the best road record at 23-14-4. Still, the Red Wings were
2-1-2 against Dallas during the regular season and the Stars now
are just 1-17-2 in their 20 visits to Joe Louis Arena since the
franchise moved from Minnesota.
	   Yet if any one thing did Dallas in during the conference finals,
it probably was the disappearance of its power play. The Stars were
just 1-for-30 with the man advantage during the series with
Detroit, and 0-for-5 in the sixth and deciding game.
	   And the Red Wings only added to Dallas' frustration by opening
the scoring with a shorthanded goal, their second of the series.
	   With a few seconds left in Kris Draper's roughing penalty, Steve
Yzerman snared a loose puck and slid it over to Darren McCarty near
center ice. McCarty hurried over the blue line, turned at the left
circle and fed the puck to Murphy, who had a step on Dallas
defenseman Sergei Zubov.
	   Murphy faked Ed Belfour toward the right side of the net, then
flipped a backhander over the goalie's stick for a shorthanded goal
and 1-0 lead at 6:20 of the first period.
	   Detroit, bidding to become the first team since the Pittsburgh
Penguins in 1992 to repeat as Cup champion, kept the pressure on.
Only the strong play of Belfour kept the score close as the Red
Wings outshot Dallas 14-7 in the first period with several quality
chances.
	   Yzerman whizzed a shot past Belfour's glove early, but the puck
hit the right post. McCarty, during another Dallas power play,
broke in alone with 5:33 left in the first period, but Belfour
closed off the right side by hooking his leg around the post to
prevent another possible shorthanded goal.
	   Fedorov scored his first goal in eight games, since the
second-round series with St. Louis, on a no-look shot from the top
of the slot. Fedorov, who leads the NHL with nine playoff goals,
seemed to catch Belfour by surprise for a 2-0 lead 1:48 into the
second period.
	   The Stars came alive after that. But then it was Detroit goalie
Chris Osgood's turn to shine. Dallas peppered Osgood, outshooting
Detroit 11-7 in the second period. But Osgood, who also shut out
Dallas in Game 1, came up with big saves to frustrate Mike Keane,
Mike Modano, Jere Lehtinen and Pat Verbeek among others.

  Phillies 8, Blue Jays 7  

<TEXT>
	   In Toronto, returning to the SkyDome for the first time since
losing the deciding sixth game of the 1993 World Series, the
Philadelphia Phillies beat the Toronto Blue Jays.
	   Philadelphia took an 8-5 lead in the ninth, scoring two runs on
Bobby Abreu's RBI single and right fielder Shawn Green's throwing
error. Green nearly made up for the costly error in the bottom of
the inning, hitting a two-run homer off Mark Leiter.
	   Tyler Green (4-4) won for the first time in five starts, giving
up five runs and seven hits in seven innings. Leiter pitched the
final two innings for his 11th save.
  Yankees 5, Marlins 1  
	   In New York, Darryl Strawberry homered to snap a seventh-inning
tie and Andy Pettitte pitched a five-hitter as New York won the
matchup between baseball's best and worst teams.
	   The Yankees won their fifth straight, while the Marlins lost
their ninth in a row.
	   Strawberry's ninth homer of the season and Chuck Knoblauch's RBI
single in the seventh helped the Yankees improve the majors' best
record to 42-13. The Marlins fell to 17-42.
  Royals 3, Astros 0  
	   In Houston, Tim Belcher pitched eight shutout innings and the
Kansas City Royals weren't distracted by pregame fines and
suspensions.
	   Earlier in the day, the Royals learned their punishments for
Tuesday's brawl with the Anaheim Angels. Manager Tony Muser
received an eight-game suspension, shortstop Felix Martinez was
suspended five games, and pitchers Jim Pittsley and Scott Service
got two-game suspensions.
	   Coaches Rich Dauer and Jamie Quirk were fined but not suspended.
	   Belcher (5-6) won for the fourth time in five decisions. He
scattered seven hits, struck out three and allowed only one runner
to reach third base. Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 10th
save.
  Brewers 7, Tigers 3  
	   In Milwaukee, Marquis Grissom drove in three runs and Cal Eldred
pitched 5 2-3 effective innings as Milwaukee beat Detroit in the
first interleague game between the former American League rivals.
	   The teams renewed a rivalry that lasted 29 years before the
Brewers became the first team in modern baseball history to switch
leagues.
	   Eldred (2-4) won his second straight start after opening the
season with a club-record six consecutive no-decisions. He allowed
seven hits.

U.S. formalizes dlrs 25 million for Guatemalan peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala hopes to strengthen its peace
with a dlrs 25 million U.S. donation for development and
reconciliation activities.
	   The United States has pledged dlrs 260 million through 2000 to
help Guatemalan implement its peace accords, U.S. Ambassador Donald
J. Planty said Friday at a ceremony.
	   Such international aid will help Guatemala strengthen its
democracy and create sustainable economic growth that will benefit
all levels of society, he said.
	   The Guatemala military and leftist rebels signed peace accords
in December to end a 36-year civil war. An estimated 140,000 people
_ most of them civilians _ were killed in the conflict, and 40,000
disappeared.

Mexico prosecutors think state money went to political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Some dlrs 20 million meant for
charity was diverted from state coffers, much of it going to the
governing political party, a Guadalajara newspaper reported Friday.
	   Jalisco state officials confirmed the Publico report that the
state Attorney General's office filed a court complaint about the
missing money in November, though it had not been previously
reported.
	   ``All of this takes time,'' state spokeswoman Irma Pia Gonzalez
said. ``In a few days we expect an indictment from the judge.''
	   The report raises a new scandal for the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has governed Mexico
since 1929. The PRI lost control of Jalisco state in 1995 to the
conservative National Action Party.
	   Officials of the new administration discovered the apparent
diversion of funds during an audit of accounts.
	   According to Publico, state officials from 1991 to 1995 shifted
almost 64 million pesos _ about dlrs 20 million at the time _ out
of accounts meant for charity.
	   In some cases, state checks were allegedly written to banks to
which the government owed no money. Instructions written on the
back of at least some checks directed the money be converted into
cashiers checks for the PRI, Publico reported.
	   It said that at least 23 million pesos went to the party.
	   PRI state spokesman Gabriel Rivera said the party had no
immediate comment on the report.
	   Gonzalez said the complaint named about six former state
officials of ``second or third level.''

Florida man makes dlrs 250,000 basket
</HEADLINE>

	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Maynard Trudeau has a quarter-million
dollars more for his retirement.
	   Trudeau, 74, won dlrs 250,000 Friday night by making a 3-point
shot during halftime of Game 2 of the NBA Finals. He won't be
spending it any time soon.
	   ``I don't retire until I'm 80,'' said Trudeau, a carpet
installer and part-time security guard from Florida.
	   Trudeau got the chance to win dlrs 2 million after being
selected from more than 1 million entrants in an AT and T
promotional campaign. The World War II veteran had five shots _ the
first four worth dlrs 250,000 each, the last a cool million. He
shot them rapidly, each underhanded. The first went through
perfectly. The others fell off.
	   Trudeau, who hit about half of his warmup tosses on Friday
afternoon, explained his success by saying ``You gotta
concentrate.''
	   Trudeau and his wife are both big Bulls fans. ``Maybe,'' he
said, ``the Jazz will give me a job.''

	     DIALING 911: Even Utah's criminals are Jazz fans during the NBA
playoffs.
	   Valley Emergency Communications Center dispatchers usually can
count on up to 200 calls for law enforcement assistance per hour on
an average night. During Wednesday night's finals opener, however,
calls dropped off sharply after the tipoff at the Delta Center.
	   VECC assistant director Gary Lancaster said that by halftime,
calls were down to about 100 per hour; by the end of the fourth
quarter, it was less than a call per minute.
	   A computer graphing of the call log showed about a 20 percent
drop in calls per quarter.
	   The Olympics, Brigham Young University football and not even
Utah's trip to the NCAA basketball championship game this year had
such an impact. Only the Super Bowl has a similar effect on the
Wasatch Front, Lancaster told the Deseret News.
	   ``It's about a 50 percent workload when the game is going,''
Lancaster said. ``Usually, as they (the Jazz) go further into the
playoffs, and the games are more important, the workload drops off
more.''
	   For instance, in the last Western Conference finals game against
the Los Angeles Lakers on May 24, dispatchers received about three
phone calls during the last seven minutes of play _ and that wasn't
even a home game.
	   ``The whole place died,'' Lancaster said. ``Like everything shut
down while the game was on.''

	     POPULAR GUY: Michael Jordan couldn't even finish the customary
Bulls team shooting contest at the end of Friday's shootaround
before dozens of reporters surrounded him on the court.
	   ``Doesn't somebody else on this team talk?'' Jordan asked. But
the pressure of the media crush doesn't bother the world's greatest
player.
	   ``I'm used to it,'' he said. ``It's not anything I'm not
accustomed to. You guys are not going to ... change my approach to
the game. I deal with it and separate it once I step on the
court.''
	   Jordan said he intends to have a good time, especially since
this championship round could prove to be his last.
	   ``We don't know that, but it could very well be the last one,
and I'm enjoying it with that purpose in mind,'' Jordan said. ``I
should enjoy this. This is fun, actually.''
	   Most of Jordan's teammates sneaked out of the shootaround while
the media clustered around Jordan.
	   ``Just doing my part for the team,'' Jordan grinned.
	   ___  
	   MUCH ADO ABOUT RODMAN: Jordan says there's nothing wrong with
Dennis Rodman's trips to Las Vegas, but there was something wrong
with the Worm's performance in Game 1.
	   ``I think he knows he didn't play particularly well,'' Jordan
said. ``His thumb bothered him a little, but he's giving us an
effort. A lot is being made of him going to Vegas, but he's been to
Vegas many times before and come back and done his job. So I don't
think that's a panic button.''
