IMF predicts large Philippine deficit unless taxes are raised 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund fears
the Philippines will suffer a large budget deficit this year unless
steps are taken to improve tax collection, according to a finance
official.
	   An IMF team was in the Philippines late last month to review the
economy's performance as part of conditions for a dlrs 1.37 billion
standby loan arrangement.
	   The finance official, who asked not to be named, said late
Monday that the IMF believes that efforts to improve tax collection
are not working and as a result the Philippines could end up in the
red.
	   The IMF has forecast that the deficit could reach 50 billion
pesos (dlrs 1.3 billion) this year unless the government improves
revenue collection by plugging loopholes and cracking down on tax
evaders.
	   The government of President Fidel Ramos passed a tax reform
package last December, but officials close to President-elect
Joseph Estrada say the reforms were not successful in sufficiently
broadening the tax base. Tax rates are generally high, causing many
people to evade or cheat on taxes.
	   Estrada, currently vice president, takes office on June 30 after
winning the presidential election on May 11.
	   In April, the government raised 55.6 billion pesos (dlrs 1.4
billion) in tax revenues, 11.3 billion pesos (dlrs 290 million)
short of what it expected. In the first quarter, the Philippines
registered a budget deficit of 12.3 billion pesos (dlrs 315
million), with the government predicting a small budget surplus by
the end of the year.
	   The Philippines posted a budget surplus of 1.6 billion pesos
(dlrs 41 million) in 1997 and 6.3 billion pesos (dlrs 161 million)
in 1996.

Pirates halt Mets winning streak with 4-3 victory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Jason Schmidt, the NL's hottest pitcher, beat
the league's hottest team as the Pittsburgh Pirates halted the New
York Mets' nine-game winning streak with a 4-3 victory.
	   The Mets' streak was the longest in the majors and covered Mike
Piazza's first seven games in New York.
	   Schmidt (8-1), the NL's first eight-game winner, had a shutout
until Piazza homered with two outs in the eighth. Schmidt gave up
six hits before leaving in the ninth following a leadoff single by
Carlos Baerga and a double by Edgardo Alfonzo.
	   After reliever Ricardo Rincon retired pinch-hitter Butch Huskey
on a popup, Rey Ordonez hit a grounder to shortstop Kevin
Polcovich, whose wild throw to first allowed Baerga to score. Jim
Tatum then hit a sacrifice fly to make it 4-3 before Rincon got
Brian McCrae on a forceout to earn his fourth save.
  Phillies 6, Expos 2  
	   In Philadelphia, Gregg Jefferies homered and snapped an
eighth-inning tie with an RBI single as the Phillies beat the
Montreal Expos.
	   Scott Rolen followed Jefferies' hit with a three-run homer off
Mike Maddux (1-2) as the Phillies snapped a three-game losing
streak.
	   Desi Relaford singled with one out in the eighth, moved to
second on a wild pitch and went to third on a groundout. After Doug
Glanville walked, Jefferies singled to center, scoring Relaford.
	   Rolen then hit an 0-1 pitch over the left field wall for his
11th home run. Wayne Gomes (4-1) allowed one hit in two innings of
scoreless relief.
  Cubs 10, Marlins 2  
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa, returning to the lineup after missing
three games with a sprained thumb, continued his long-ball binge
with two homers as the streaking Cubs beat the slumping Florida
Marlins.
	   Sosa hit a two-run shot in the first and a three-run homer in
the eighth, his 14th and 15th this year. It was the third time in
his last four games that Sosa has hit two homers.
	   Henry Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the first and an RBI
double in the fifth as the Cubs won their fourth straight and
handed the Marlins their sixth consecutive loss.
	   Jeremi Gonzalez (4-5) ended a personal three-game losing streak,
giving up two runs and five hits in 7 2-3 innings. Ryan Dempster
(0-1) lasted 1 1-3 innings in his first major league start, giving
up five runs, four hits and three walks.
  Braves 5, Brewers 2  
	   In Milwaukee, Atlanta's Greg Maddux pitched a five-hitter and
won his sixth straight game as the Braves beat the Brewers.
	   Maddux (8-2) struck out a season-high 10, one short of his
career best, and didn't walk a batter in helping snap the Braves'
four-game skid and Milwaukee's five-game winning streak.
	   Maddux came within one out of his 25th career shutout before
Jeromy Burnitz hit a two-run homer. Maddux took a line drive off
his left hip from Mark Loretta in the sixth, but third baseman
Chipper Jones made a diving grab for the out and Maddux, unhurt,
pumped his right fist in congratulations.
	   Former Brewers pitcher Don Sutton, now a member of the Braves
broadcast crew, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the
Braves played their first game in Milwaukee since bolting to
Atlanta following the 1965 season.
  Diamondbacks 6, Rockies 4  
	   In Denver, Andy Benes pitched a eight strong innings, Devon
White drove in two runs and the Arizona Diamondbacks snapped a
three-game losing streak.
	   Kelly Stinnett added a solo homer for the expansion
Diamondbacks, who gained some revenge for being swept by Colorado
in their season-opening, three-game series in Phoenix.
	   Benes (4-5), outpitched by Colorado's Darryl Kile in the
Diamondbacks' franchise opener, prevailed over Kile in the rematch.
After giving up a homer to Dante Bichette in the first, Benes
settled down and at one point retired 13 straight batters.
	   With Arizona leading 6-1 in the ninth, Benes gave up three hits,
including a three-run homer by Vinny Castilla. Gregg Olson got the
last two outs for his seventh save.

Poll: Hanson splits conservatives, Labor Party to take Queensland 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf to say `no parole' instead of `new parole'
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A new poll released Tuesday predicted
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party will split the conservative vote
in Queensland's June 13 election, lifting the opposition Labor
Party to power.
	   If Labor ousts conservative Premier Rob Borbidge's government,
it will be a bad omen for the nationwide chances of Prime Minister
John Howard and his conservatives in the federal election expected
later this year.
	   Whether or not Hanson's party, famous for its anti-gun control,
anti-Asian immigration, and anti-Aboriginal welfare policies wins
any seats itself, it would have made a major impact on Australia's
political landscape.
	   In an effort to win back potential One Nation voters, Borbidge
has been talking tough on crime, unveiling new legislation to make
sure violent criminals serve their entire sentence with no parole.
	   Labor and Borbidge's conservatives currently hold 44 seats each
in the state's 89-seat Parliament; Borbidge has governed only
because a single conservative independent member of Parliament has
voted with his side.
	   The Newspoll survey in The Australian newspaper shows support
for the governing conservative coalition in big-city Brisbane seats
dropped from 42 percent to 25 percent while Labor had soared from
49 to 54 percent.
	   The Newspoll showed support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation
Party had tripled to 15 percent in the past six months statewide,
and almost doubled to 7 percent nationally in the past two weeks.
	   In Queensland rural areas, support for the governing
conservatives had slumped from 54 percent to 41 percent.
	   Borbidge told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Tuesday that
it looked like his party was ``behind the eight ball.''
	   The poll was conducted last weekend by telephone to 1,007
Queensland households. Newspoll said the margin of error on various
questions ranged from 3 to 4.4 percent, depending on the number of
respondents.
	   The poll suggests the Labor Party under Peter Beattie would gain
enough seats to hold a comfortable majority even if One Nation
Party wins several seats on its own, thus denying Hanson the
balance of power.

Commiseration kisses may have spread meningococcal infection 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Hundreds of mourners may have been
exposed to a potentially fatal disease at a funeral in Tasmania
state, health authorities said Tuesday.
	   Health officials are trying to locate up to 300 people who
attended the funeral after a 76-year-old woman at the service was
admitted to Launceston General Hospital on May 28 with
meningococcal infection.
	   It is believed the woman kissed most or all of the mourners at
the service and a wake afterwards, possibly exposing them to the
infection, which is usually spread through contact such as kissing
or sharing food.
	   Acting public health director Avner Misrachi said it was rare
for the infection to become serious and that most affected people,
while short-term carriers, would not feel ill.
	   But it could cause meningitis or septicemia, possibly leading to
serious long-term complications and death.
	   Dr. Misrachi said risk of infection was usually small because of
the intimate nature of the contact required for it's spread.
	   He said officers had so far tracked down and treated with
antibiotics about 150 people who attended the funeral.
	   The infected woman is still in hospital, but has been moved from
isolation to a general ward, he said.

Minister: Australia's new frigates ``floating targets'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A junior government minister said
Tuesday that Australia's eight new naval frigates will be
``floating targets'' because the previous Labor government did not
plan to arm them properly.
	   The Defense, Science, Industry and Personnel minister, Bronwyn
Bishop, said the Labor government had not taken a strategic
approach to the frigate project.
	   ``Thus we have built some fine frigates, which because of the
previous government's policies are floating targets,'' Bishop said.
	   She said Australia's conservative government, elected in 1996,
is tackling this problem by moving its spending from the ``blunt''
end of defense to the ``sharp end.''
	   ``It is this government which will turn them into capable
platforms that can be used in the defense of Australia,'' Bishop
said.
	   She was speaking in Canberra at the launch of the government's
new defense acquisition program.
	   New Zealand has also ordered two of the ships, which are known
as ANZAC frigates.
	   Bishop also described two amphibious warfare ships, which the
Labor government purchased second-hand from the U.S. Navy, as
``rustbuckets.''
	   They are presently being refitted for service in the Australian
navy.

Loans from World Bank, ADB to help power-short Vietnam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank have pledged to provide dlrs 620 million in loans for projects
to ease Vietnam's chronic power shortages, the Vietnam Economic
Times reported Tuesday.
	   The World Bank will provide dlrs 350 million for three projects,
including dlrs 150 million for Dai Ninh, a 300-megawatt
hydroelectric plant in the central highlands province of Lam Dong,
and dlrs 100 million for improving efficiency of electricity
delivery, the report said.
	   ADB will provide dlrs 150 million for the Sesan 3 hydroelectric
plant and dlrs 120 million for a northern power distribution
network.
	   The loans are for the 1998-2000 fiscal years.
	   Vietnam has been running into regular power shortages each year,
particularly during the dry season, as it increases industrial
production.
	   The problems have been underscored by the worst drought this
century, which has hampered the hydroelectric plants that supply
the bulk of the country's power.
	   The drought has eased in recent weeks with the onset of the
rainy season, and rotating power cuts that had been imposed
nationwide are being dropped.

Fugitive banker returned home to Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A fugitive Mexican banker was extradited from
Spain to face fraud charges, four years after being accused of
swindling banks out of dlrs 4 million.
	   Angel Rodriguez Saez is the first major player in Mexico's 1994
banking and political scandals to be returned to his home country.
	   Rodriguez Saez was escorted Monday to Mexico City by Mexican
federal agents aboard an Iberia airlines flight.
	   Rodriguez Saez, a flashy businessman known as ``El Divino'' _
The Divine One _ built a financial empire during Mexico's banking
privatization in the early 1990s.
	   He left Mexico in 1994 and regulatory authorities seized his
bank, Banpais, the next year after discovering capital shortfalls
and bookkeeping ``irregularities.'' He was charged with fiscal
fraud and violation of banking laws.
	   Spanish police arrested Rodriguez Saez in July 1996 after he
dove off his yacht into the Mediterranean to try to elude
authorities.
	   Spanish judicial authorities agreed to his extradition in
February and Rodriguez Saez dropped his objections to the ruling
two months later. Spain's federal government approved the
extradition on May 22.
	   Mexican officials have failed to win extradition of former
Assistant Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu from the United
States, while financier Carlos Cabal Peniche _ the most important
figure in the 1994 banking scandals _ is still at large.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican police have arrested two men and
seized 14,000 sea turtle eggs, which poachers have been known to
sell as aphrodisiacs around the world.
	   Jorge Garcia Avendano and Antonio Olmedo Garcia were caught
transporting the turtle eggs in a truck along the highway between
the Pacific resort of Acapulco and Oaxaca state, the federal
Attorney General's office said in a statement Monday.
	   Mexico's Pacific beaches are prime nesting grounds for sea
turtles, which along with their eggs are protected by a 1990 law.
	   Biologists have tried to persuade poor villagers from scavenging
the eggs by giving them other means of support, such as pay for
cleaning up beaches and gathering fire wood.

Philippine stocks suffer heavy losses, peso weakens 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged to a
four-month low Tuesday as most Asian stock markets continued to
reel from a selloff triggered by fears of a possible economic
recession sweeping the region, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 49.97 points,
or 2.5 percent, to 1,946.08, according to preliminary data. It was
the index's lowest closing level since Jan. 29, when it registered
1,796.68. On Monday, it gave up 15.40 points.
	   Tuesday was the eighth straight session of losses by the market,
with the main index shedding 202.53 points, or 9.4 percent, during
the period.
	   Having broken its 1,950-support Tuesday, the index is expected
to test its next support level of 1,900 points, traders said.
	   Foremost among the danger signs which sidelined investors was
the weak performance of the Japanese yen against the dollar in
morning trading, dealers said.
	   Investors feared the weak yen may spawn another round of
devaluations of regional currencies. This is expected to further
undermine the already fragile state of most Asian economies, many
of which contracted in the first quarter, traders said. An
exception was the Philippines, whose gross national product grew by
2.5 percent in the three-month period.
	   Taking its cue from the weak yen, the peso averaged 39.414 to a
dollar in morning trading, compared to Monday's 39.072 pesos.
	   Dealers said heavier losses by the peso continued to be averted
by weak corporate demand for dollars. The thin demand has helped
buffer the peso as other regional currencies have fallen.
	   Despite a fall in Treasury bill yields on Monday to their lowest
level since the region's currency crisis erupted last July, the
central bank elected to hold its key overnight borrowing and
lending rates at 13.125 percent and 15.125 percent respectively.
Some market watchers believe the recent fall in Treasury yields is
bottoming out.
	   Despite the Philippines' peaceful and credible national
elections last month and economic growth in the first quarter,
foreign investors aren't inclined to view the country positively
given its regional context, said Mitzi de Dios, trader for ABN-AMRO
Hoare Govett Securities Philippines Inc.
	   De Dios said as long as Asia can't come up with a clean bill of
economic health, the Philippines will be unable to capitalize on
its inherent advantages.
	   ``Foreign investors, across the board, are pulling out. The
Philippines is still better off compared to its neighbors, but the
negative sentiment in the region is pulling us down,'' she said.

Report: Animals at Indonesian zoo going hungry due to currency crisis 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 2,500 animals at an Indonesian
zoo are on the brink of starvation because their keepers can no
longer afford spiraling food costs, a result of the country's
severe economic crisis, a news report said.
	   Animals at the Safari Wildlife Park in Cisarua, West Java, have
to go without food for as many as three days each week, zoo
officials were quoted as saying in Tuesday's Jakarta Post
newspaper.
	   ``I hope that international animal welfare groups can
temporarily help us fund our operations,'' Tony Sumampauw, one of
the park's owners, told the Post.
	   The paper ran a photo of an emaciated baby chimpanzee being fed
milk from a bottle.
	   The zoo is home to 225 species of animals from five continents
and houses the largest collection of tigers in the world, including
27 of the endangered Sumatran tiger.
	   Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has lost 70 percent of its
value against the dollar since last July when an economic crisis
rolled across Asia.
	   Much of the meat needed to feed the carnivores is imported, but
even the cost of locally produced substitutes such as chicken have
risen sharply.
	   The zoo's daily operating costs, consisting mostly of food
expenditures, have jumped from 7 million rupiah (dlrs 600) to 18
million rupiah (dlrs 1,525), while ticket sales have plunged to
around 4 million rupiah (dlrs 340), the owners said.
	   ``We have no idea what will happen to our animals if the
situation worsens,'' Sumampauw said.

PITTSBURGH: seventh save. Padres 3, Cardinals 2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   At San Diego, St. Louis lost Mark McGwire to back spasms in the
first inning, then watched light-hitting Chris Gomez homer in
consecutive at-bats to help the Padres beat the Cardinals.
	   The Cardinals said McGwire's status was day-to-day. The slugger,
who leads the major leagues with 27 homers, walked off under his
own power after hitting a dribbler down the first-base line in the
first inning off left-hander Sterling Hitchcock (3-0).
	   McGwire, who set a big league record for the most home runs
through the end of May, began the night with an NL-leading 68 RBIs
and was on a pace to shatter Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs
set in 1961.
	   The first baseman has been plagued by injuries throughout his
career. He was on the disabled list in 1989 and then every season
from 1992-1996 because of problems with his foot, heel, back and
ribs.
  Giants 16, Reds 3  
	   In San Francisco, Jeff Kent and Charlie Hayes each tied career
highs with five RBIs, and the Giants used an eight-run fifth inning
to rout the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Barry Bonds scored four runs for the Giants, and Mark Gardner
(4-2) survived a shaky start to get the victory. He allowed three
runs and six hits over seven innings.
	   Kent went 2-for-2 with a sacrifice fly, three-run homer and
bases-loaded walk. Hayes was 3-for-5 with an RBI single, a two-run
double and a two-run single.

Clamor builds in Indonesia for justice in Suharto-era crimes 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo JAK106
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ One night in 1984, after days of
anti-government sermons at mosques, soldiers opened fire on
thousands of protesters in a poor Jakarta neighborhood. Numerous
deaths were reported, but the military quickly closed the case.
	   Now, with autocratic President Suharto out of power and his
successor promising an era of political freedom and accountability,
relatives see a chance for justice. They are not alone.
	   For decades, Suharto's opponents were jailed or muzzled.
Emboldened by the push for democratic reform, many Indonesians want
government leaders to pay for alleged misdeeds during his 32-year
rule.
	   Calls for investigations come almost daily. On Monday, the
attorney general announced a probe of government corruption under
Suharto, but stopped short of targeting the former leader, whose
wealth is estimated in the billions of dollars.
	   There are fears that a clamor to put officials on trial could
divide the fragile nation, caught up in the political and economic
turmoil that forced Suharto to resign May 21. The powerful armed
forces are likely to resist efforts to uncover abuses.
	   ``Everybody's got their own case,'' said Salim Said, an expert
on the Indonesian military. ``Our immediate problem is how to get
the economy on its feet.''
	   Not for the family of Amir Biki, a businessman killed Sept. 12,
1984, in the Jakarta neighborhood of Tanjung Priok after
criticizing the government in a speech at a mosque. Muslim
preachers fueled a street protest with fiery sermons.
	   Official records indicate 18 people died, but Biki's family
alleges that soldiers killed more than 400 and dumped most of the
corpses in unmarked graves.
	   ``Where are those bodies now? We still don't know,'' said Boddi
Biki, a 57-year-old caretaker of a mosque named after his brother,
whose grave in a nearby garden is ringed by a wall of white tile.
	   Two days after Suharto quit, the family demanded that the armed
forces commander in charge at the time stand trial.
	   In another prominent case, police are being urged to look again
at the 1996 killing of a journalist whose articles on corruption
angered local authorities, including a relative of Suharto, near
the city of Yogyakarta.
	   Human rights workers say police framed an innocent man in the
death of Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, a journalist for Bernas
newspaper, who was attacked outside his home. The suspect was freed
because of a lack of evidence; some police officers were demoted.
	   Suharto's departure clears the way for serious pursuit of the
killer or killers, said Parni Hadi, secretary general of the
Indonesian Journalists' Association.
	   ``The big barrier has fallen,'' Hadi said. ``People are getting
more and more courageous.''
	   While the figurehead of the old era is gone, many people who
loyally served Suharto remain in the government, including
President B.J. Habibie, and could be exposed to legal action.
	   Indonesia's new justice minister, Muladi, said Monday that he
favored an investigation into the 1975 killings of five Australian
journalists in the disputed territory of East Timor.
	   An Australian inquiry found in 1996 that a force led by
Indonesian military officers had attacked the journalists. The
local special forces commander at the time, Yunus Yosfiah, has been
named the information minister in Habibie's new Cabinet.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam and Cambodia have signed several
agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between the former
enemies and improving what both countries called their growing
friendship.
	   The agreements, covering road transport, cooperation in
communications and a memorandum of understanding for drug-control
measures, were signed Monday during a two-day visit by Cambodian
First Prime Minister Ung Huot.
	   At a state banquet Monday night, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai praised the improvement of ties. Vietnam had a decade-long
occupation of Cambodia that ended in 1989.
	   ``We are pleased to see that our relations have been
consolidated and developed over the recent years,'' Khai said.
``Our remaining problems are also being resolved through peaceful
negotiations.
	   ``Consolidating and strengthening our cooperation is more
significant given the fact that the regional crisis has given us
numerous difficulties and challenges.''
	   Ung Huot said both countries are ``promoting bilateral
cooperation with an aim to building a Southeast Asia of peace,
friendship, cooperation and brotherhood.''
	   Ung Huot, accompanied by several government ministers, arrived
Monday for talks with high-ranking officials.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam and Cambodia have signed several
agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between the former
enemies and improving what both countries called their growing
friendship.
	   The agreements, covering road transport, cooperation in
communications and a memorandum of understanding for drug-control
measures, were signed Monday during a two-day visit by Cambodian
First Prime Minister Ung Huot.
	   At a state banquet Monday night, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai praised the improvement of ties. Vietnam had a decade-long
occupation of Cambodia that ended in 1989.
	   ``We are pleased to see that our relations have been
consolidated and developed over the recent years,'' Khai said.
``Our remaining problems are also being resolved through peaceful
negotiations.
	   ``Consolidating and strengthening our cooperation is more
significant given the fact that the regional crisis has given us
numerous difficulties and challenges.''
	   Ung Huot said both countries are ``promoting bilateral
cooperation with an aim to building a Southeast Asia of peace,
friendship, cooperation and brotherhood.''
	   Ung Huot, accompanied by several government ministers, arrived
Monday for talks with high-ranking officials.

Swiss financier Rey extradited from Bahamas 
</HEADLINE>
By JESSICA ROBERTSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A former Swiss financier wanted on
charges of embezzlement in his home country has been extradited
after spending more than two years in a prison cell in the Bahamas.
	   Werner Rey was extradited late Monday in the custody of Swiss
officials on a charter jet. Looking haggard, Rey was escorted by
four guards, two of them carrying submachine guns, across the
tarmac and onto the plane.
	   The Swiss government claims Rey defrauded European investors of
more than dlrs 1 billion and left dlrs 2.8 billion in public and
private debt when his business empire collapsed in 1991.
	   Rey, who denies any wrongdoing, made his money in a takeover of
Bally, a Swiss shoe manufacturer. He used heavily leveraged deals
in the 1980s to build up his main company, Omni Holding AG.
	   In 1992, the Swiss government charged Rey with fraudulent
bankruptcy, business fraud, falsification of accounts and other
felonies.
	   He and his wife, Bernadette Gately, fled Switzerland for the
Bahamas in 1991 and became a permanent residents of the country in
1992. He was arrested in March 1996 and had since been held in a
cell at Her Majesty's Prison in Nassau while his lawyers fought to
keep him in the Bahamas.
	   In April, Rey lost his final appeal against extradition before
the Privy Council of London, the supreme court for several former
British colonies.

Police smash gang that mugged with motorcycle helmets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Skull-smashing blows from motorcycle
helmets wielded by robbery gangs as clubs have killed at least one
victim and injured a score of others in a mugging spree across the
Thai capital, police reported Tuesday.
	   Police have broken two criminal gangs favoring the helmets _ an
ubiquitous accessory in a grid-locked city where motorcycles are
the only way to get anywhere on time _ to knock victims unconscious
before robbing them. A third gang is still believed at large.
	   The latest gang was broken Sunday when police nabbed one
suspect, Decha Jonsuk, 19, as he was allegedly about to clout an
unsuspecting pedestrian wearing a gold chain, one of the gang's
preferred items to steal. Another was Rolex watches.
	   ``He was a very strong, healthy person, with lots of muscles,''
Police Lt. Col. Varanthorn Chai-Aya said of Decha. ``When he
smashed someone, they were really smashed.''
	   Police said the robbers cruised streets they knew well on a
motorcycle, looking for victims. When they found one, the passenger
would dismount, trail the victim, smash and rob him, then hop on
the back of the motorcycle to flee.
	   Just one blow was usually needed to knock the victim out. One
man was killed Feb. 2 and his gold chain, Rolex and jade Buddha
pendant were stolen.
	   Decha was identified Monday by eight of his alleged victims.
Several had suffered missing teeth and jaw fractures. Some said
they had nervous problems and were unable to return to work.
	   Also arrested were Decha's driver and a stolen goods dealer. The
trio face charges including robbery causing death, punishable by a
maximum of life imprisonment.
	   They are believed to have acquired 2 million baht (dlrs 50,000)
in stolen goods.
	   At least 22 helmet-attack robberies have been committed since
early this year, police said. Another such gang was broken a month
ago. The robberies are part of an upsurge in crime accompanying the
country's economic crisis.

China reserves nuclear option, but pushing for halt to arms race 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous cycle
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is reserving the option of resuming nuclear
testing, given rising tensions in South Asia, but for now is
seeking an international solution to halt an arms race.
	   China will urge the world's powers to cool tensions between
India and Pakistan when foreign ministers of the U.N. Security
Council's permanent members meet Thursday in Geneva, a senior
Foreign Ministry official told reporters late Monday.
	   China conducted its 45th and last nuclear test in 1996, declared
a moratorium and then signed a global treaty banning nuclear
testing.
	   But even the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty allows countries to
resume testing if their ``supreme national security'' is
threatened, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``I'm not saying China will do it. But we have to take into
account this development. China is urging the world to do
something,'' he said.
	   China fears India's and Pakistan's tit-for-tat testing will
ignite an arms race that would set back years of progress toward
disarmament, said the official.
	   China has no proposal for responding to the tests, the official
said. ``That's why we're meeting. We have to work it out.''
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, speaking by telephone, proposed the Geneva
meeting, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
	   Tang, Albright and the foreign ministers of Russia, France and
Britain will attend the meeting. All five countries, in addition to
being permanent Security Council members, were the world's only
declared nuclear powers before India's tests last month.
	   China believes that the advent of new nuclear powers could only
destabilize the region, Zhu said.
	   ``We should urge them with one voice and make them realize it's
not in their interest,'' he said.
	   Although China sees Pakistan as a close ally and is suspected of
having aided Islamabad's nuclear program, Beijing has moved in
recent years to improve relations with India.
	   Zhu said China was ``infuriated'' when India tried to justify
the tests by claiming nuclear-power China as its top threat.
	   ``We are not their enemy,'' he said, adding the accusation was
an insult.
	   The senior official denied that China has helped Pakistan, its
close ally, develop nuclear weapons.
	   He confirmed that President Clinton spoke with President Jiang
Zemin by telephone before Pakistan conducted its tests. But he
denied reports Jiang called on Pakistan to forego testing at
Clinton's urging.
	   Jiang wrote to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ``on his
own, absolutely 100 percent,'' he said.

Asian crisis fuels current account deficit, Aussie dollar slumps by opposition, economists 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with election timing problems for government; comments
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Asian currency crisis fueled a
massive U.S. dlrs 1.22 billion (2 billion Australian dollars) rise
in Australia's current account deficit in the first three months of
1998, the government said Tuesday.
	   While the figure was within the range of expectations, it is
edging closer to 6 percent of gross domestic product, a level that,
back in 1986, then-Treasurer Paul Keating said was indicative of a
``banana republic.''
	   It also puts Prime Minister John Howard in a dilemma. Now is
hardly a good time to call an election that must be held before
March 1999, but the longer he waits to call it, the more the Asian
crisis could harm Australia's economy _ and his chances of
re-election.
	   Opposition Labor Party treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said the
current account was at about 5.5 percent of gross domestic product.
	   ``The `banana republic' was 6 percent plus; we're looking at 5
1/2 percent now, with the full effect of Asia still to bite. So
we're getting close,'' he said.
	   The overall economic problems also undermined the Australian
dollar, which slumped to 61.15 U.S. cents, a 12-year low.
	   The slump in Asian prices for Australian products pushed the
current account deficit to a three-year high of U.S. dlrs 4.57
billion (7.5 billion Australian dollars), widening by 33 percent
since the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
said.
	   Economists had predicted the blowout, blaming the Asian currency
crisis and struggling exports.
	   Net foreign debt rose to U.S. dlrs 137 billion (225 billion
Australian dollars), the Bureau said.
	   The All Ordinaries stock index lost 45 points, 1.6 percent of
its value, by midday Tuesday.
	   The current account deterioration is ``a portent of things to
come,'' said Craig James, chief economist at Colonial State Bank.
	   ``The important point'' to take from the data is that ``the
current account deficit will widen further'' over coming quarters,
and likely will reach record levels over coming months, James said.
	   John Peters, senior economist, financial markets at Westpac
Banking Corp., agreed that while the deficit was close to
expectations, ``We can expect continuing deterioration over 1998.''
	   The deterioration in the goods trade balance shows ``the full
effect of the Asia crisis,'' James said.

Eds: UPDATES with McGwire expecting to miss next three games,
<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Mark McGwire, leading the majors with 27 home
runs, expects to miss the St. Louis Cardinals' next three games
after leaving Monday night's game because of lower back spasms.
	   ``It's nothing to be concerned about. It probably won't be more
than a few games,'' McGwire said after St. Louis lost 3-2 at San
Diego.
	   McGwire said he did not expect to play in the Cardinals'
three-game series at Los Angeles that begins Tuesday night.
	   McGwire walked off under his own power after hitting a dribbler
down the first-base line in the first inning.
	   ``I took an awkward swing and I felt a twinge,'' he said. ``I
know my back like the back of my hand. I'm not going to push it.''
	   McGwire, who set a big league record for the most home runs
through the end of May, leads the NL with 68 RBIs. He is on a pace
to shatter Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs set in 1961.
	   The first baseman has been plagued by injuries throughout his
career. He was on the disabled list in 1989 and then every season
from 1992-1996 because of problems with his foot, heel, back and
ribs.

Hong Kong falls, other markets weak on recession and yen fears 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Markets fell sharply in Hong Kong and elsewhere
in Asia on Tuesday because of the weakness of the Japanese yen and
fears that the whole region was heading toward another long bout of
bad economic news.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which has been on an extended
losing streak since getting the word last week that the economy was
heading toward recession, shed 156 points by midday. That came on
top of other large losses in the past week _ 3.8 percent, or 322
points on Monday, and more than 5 percent last Wednesday.
	   Manila also was sharply lower. Singapore fell after opening
higher. In currency markets, the Thai baht reached an 11-week low
of 42.20 to the U.S. dollar. Tokyo's main stock index rebounded
from Monday's large loss, but analysts said there was not much
steam in the rally. The yen continued its fall.
	   After the government announced last Friday that Hong Kong's
economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter, institutional
investors expect declines in the earnings of blue-chip companies,
said Kenny Tang, research manager at Tung Tai Securities.
	   He also cited skepticism in the market that a seven-point
government program would have much of an effect. It includes plans
to streamline residential mortgage programs, improve bank liquidity
and boost tourism.
	   Hong Kong's chief civil servant, Anson Chan, said the measures
needed time to work. Speaking before leaving on a trip to Japan and
the United States, she also reiterated that officials were ``very
confident that our medium to long-term prospects are good.''
	   Nearly a year into Asia's economic problems, Hong Kong is just
now beginning to feel strong effects. Unemployment is at a 14-year
high, and in the all-important property market prices have fallen
about 40 percent.
	   Hong Kong's main air carrier, Cathay Pacific has also been
affected.
	   ``We are, indeed, facing the worst market situation in the
history of the company, entering into a period of slower or
negative growth and narrow or nonexistent profit margins on most
routes,'' spokesman Willy Boulter said in the company's in-house
newsletter.
	   ``This situation is driven by weak market demand in our core
Asian territories, from Japan in the north, to Australia in the
south,'' he said.
	   The bad news was not limited to Hong Kong. The fall in the Thai
currency was tied to fears over Japan's economy. Japan is
Thailand's largest creditor, and recession in Japan could slow
recovery in Thailand.
	   In Manila, the main index fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low
on fears of a regional recession. Singapore's Straits Times index
opened higher, but slumped 1.2 percent by its midday close.
	   Taiwan's markets stabilized after a rough ride on Monday.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index rebounded after losing almost 350 points,
or 2.2 percent, on Monday because of worries about the Japanese
economy. It was up almost 100 points in early afternoon trading,
but traders said there appeared to be few reasons for it to go much
higher.
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 139.52 yen, up about 0.4 yen late
Monday in Tokyo. Traders said the dollar could easily break above
140 yen, and perhaps to 142 in the near future.

End of El Nino may bring more rain, less haze to S.E. Asia 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The end of El Nino could bring relief to
Southeast Asia, which is entering the dry season when haze from
forest fires is expected to intensify, meteorological experts said
Tuesday.
	   As the disruptive weather phenomenon ends this month, Pacific
Ocean temperatures could cool beyond their normal level, and ``that
means excessive rainfall (for the) Australian and Indonesian
area,'' Godwin Obasi, secretary-general of the World Meteorological
Organization, told reporters.
	   Such rain would dampen the fires that were expected to burn out
of control on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan
during the June-August dry season, causing thick haze to shroud
wide swathes of Southeast Asia.
	   The intergovernmental organization is holding a regional
workshop in Singapore on cross-border smoke and haze in Southeast
Asia, attended by representatives of national weather services and
other experts.
	   ``The only chance that these fires can be put out is by rain,
despite a lot of ground efforts,'' explained Woon Shih Lai,
director of Singapore's Meteorological Service.
	   ``Once this El Nino finishes, and it is predicted that this
current one will end at the end of this month, then the Pacific
Ocean becomes normal,'' Obasi said. ``How intense the normal
situation will become, I cannot say at the present.''
	   Woon added that several factors will influence how intense the
fires and resulting haze become, notably whether large-scale
burning continues in Indonesia, and how strongly the weather
patterns reverse as El Nino ends.
	   ``If the prediction of El Nino going to end soon happens to turn
out to be correct, then there is a greater chance that the
situation will be much better than last year,'' Woon said.
	   Both Obasi and Woon were wary of definite predictions, saying it
was too early to tell exactly how the weather pattern will evolve,
and what effects it will have on the haze.
	   ``We cannot be sure that without El Nino, definitely there will
be no haze,'' said Woon ``It's a bit difficult to tell now.''
	   The World Meteorological Organization will release its latest
assessment of the evolving El Nino phenomenon, and its possible
effects on world weather patterns Wednesday.
	   Southeast Asia experienced its worst episode of haze last year,
when an estimated 2 million hectares (5 million acres) of
Indonesian forest were burned, according to a United Nations study.
	   The fires and haze resulted in dlrs 4.4 billion in global
damage, especially in Southeast Asia, according to a recent study
by two major environmental groups.

FOR RELEASE AT 1400 GMT, JUNE 2, TIME SET BY SOURCE PECC Study: Asia Pacific in recession year 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ This is a recession year for the Asia-Pacific
region, with negative growth already projected for Indonesia,
Japan, South Korea, Russia and Thailand, the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council said in a report released Tuesday.
	   The United States' economic growth this year will be a full
percentage point less than in 1997, or 2.8 percent, mainly because
the Asian financial crisis has slowed down the expansion rate of
U.S. exports, said the annual study, released simultaneously in
Washington, D.C.
	   Average growth this year for 20 Pacific Rim nations should
stabilize at about 2.6 percent, two percentage points below last
year's level, but growth is expected to accelerate next year to 3.5
percent, said the council's Pacific Economic Outlook.
	   Prepared by The Asia Foundation, a private organization that
promotes U.S.-Asia relations, the report has a nine-year record of
accuracy within a half percentage point on its forecasts for the 20
nations of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC).
	   However, ``given the rapid unfolding of economic events in the
region, any economic forecast is bound to be wrought with
uncertainties,'' said P.C. Leung, a Hong Kong official who is the
PECC director general.
	   ``For 1998, we can use the term `recession year,''' he said.
Banks and financial services companies are the hardest hit, but
many other types of firms will also go bankrupt, he said, and the
effects appear to be worsening as the year goes on.
	   ``Consumption is falling with the drop in consumer confidence
and declining investment,'' Leung said.
	   Countries that have been less seriously affected by the Asian
financial crisis _ Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Singapore _ may lose three percentage points of growth that could
otherwise have been expected, the report said.
	   The PECC listed four risks to the predicted recovery in 1999:
	   _ excessive monetary contraction in the seriously affected
economies;
	   _ political uncertainty in several economies, especially
Indonesia, Australia, Colombia and the Philippines;
	   _ the failure of Japan's fiscal stimulus to bring domestic
recovery;
	   _ a protectionist backlash by Asian countries that may try to
get out of trouble by increasing their trade surpluses.
	   Another risk, mentioned at a news conference presenting the
report, is the chance of China reversing its promise not to devalue
its currency, which would spark a new wave of financial turmoil in
Asia.
	   ``Reflecting the sentiment of the market, there is widespread
expectation of a devaluation, notwithstanding the strong desire to
take the (Chinese) premier at his word,'' said Chris J. Stephenson,
a director at Arthur Andersen, which was involved in releasing the
report.
	   ``Domestic Chinese partners in state-owned enterprises are at
this time resisting U.S. dollar financing of their projects,''
Stephenson said. ``They want renminbi (the Chinese currency)
financing because they themselves are concerned about
devaluation.''
	   A fall in the U.S. stock exchange would also seriously damage
Asia's recovery chances, Stephenson added.
	   ``This is a hazardous time for any forecaster. The situation
changes from day to day,'' said Toh Mun Heng, the council's
Singapore researcher.
	   He predicted Singapore's growth will drop below 2 percent,
further than government predictions. But because Singapore is such
a small economy, he said the government has stimulus measures ready
to keep it from falling into recession.
	   The PECC, made up of academics, businessmen and government
officials is the only official observer organization to the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The forecasts were prepared by researchers in member countries
before Japan's stimulation measures in January and Indonesia's
change of government in May. An update is due in September.

Indonesia's new government recognizes independent labor union 
</HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Keeping up the pace of reform, the
Indonesian government Tuesday formally recognized the legality of
the country's largest independent labor union, suppressed before by
ex-President Suharto's old regime.
	   Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris told reporters the Indonesian
Welfare Labor Union could now operate as a legal organization.
	   The union is headed by dissident Muchtar Pakpahan, one of four
political prisoners released by the government in recent days.
	   ``According to the labor laws, it meets all criteria to exist,''
the minister said of the union after talks with new President B.J.
Habibie.
	   Habibie, formally Suharto's deputy, replaced the 76-year-old
autocrat on May 21 after the nation of 202 million people was
rocked by rioting and protests, sparked by the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   In his brief time in office, Habibie has promised to make big
economic and political changes, most notably a plan to liberalize
the tightly controlled political system and to hold elections in
1999.
	   During Suharto's era, human rights groups regularly criticized
Indonesia for suppressing workers' rights and allowing bosses to
pay unfair wages. Many employees were also forced to work in
sweatshop conditions.
	   Until his release last week, Pakpahan had been serving a three
year sentence for allegedly organizing a workers' riot on the
island of Sumatra in 1994. Since his release, other charges of
subversion against him have been dropped.
	   On Monday Indonesia's attorney general's office announced it had
launched a broad inquiry into corruption under Suharto's rule.
	   Among other things, it is expected to look at how Suharto's
family amassed billions of dollars through business deals based on
their position and power.
	   Despite continuing announcements of reform measures, some
student protesters, who played a key role in Suharto's ouster,
remain dissatisfied.
	   Less than 100 students staged a noisy but peaceful protest
outside Parliament Tuesday calling for immediate elections.
	   Others have demanded Habibie, a long time friend of Suharto's,
step down immediately.
	   About 50 protesters also gathered outside the U.S. Embassy for a
second day to criticize tough reform demands being made by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The Washington-based IMF is now considering whether to restart a
dlrs 43 billion bailout package for Indonesia. The package was
derailed last month when political turmoil hit the world's fourth
most populous nation.

Catholic Church to defrock Philippine priest over wedding 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Catholic priest who got married in
the southern Philippines while wearing his church robes will be
asked to relinquish them, church officials said Tuesday.
	   The Rev. Hector Canto, 36, exchanged wedding vows Sunday with
Cynthia Diamante, a 24-year-old engineer he met in his parish, in a
ceremony in the town of Lambunao in Iloilo province attended by
about 600 people.
	   Msgr. Pedro Quitorio, assistant secretary-general of the
Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, said Canto will be
asked to leave the priesthood because of his actions.
	   He said a priest can ask permission to marry from his bishop,
who in turn asks for dispensation from Pope John Paul II to
recognize the wedding. The priest is then asked to leave the
priesthood because of the end of his vow of celibacy, Quitorio
said.
	   ``There is no compromise. He is violating teachings of the
Church,'' he said of Canto. ``The moment you commit yourself in
marriage you cease becoming a priest.''
	   Quitorio said a special committee has been formed to determine
sanctions for the Rev. Jesus Siva, who officiated the wedding.
	   ``Apparently, his theology is also wrong,'' said Quitorio. ``He
has to take several tests to determine what punishment he should
receive.''
	   There are about 6,000 priests in the Philippines, serving about
60 million Filipino Catholics, Quitorio said.
	   Very few Filipino priests ask permission to leave the priesthood
to get married, he said.
	   Canto is assistant parish priest of Dumangas, a town about 40
kilometers (25 miles) from Lambunao.

Aftershocks hit Chinese villages recovering from earlier quake 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two mild earthquakes on Monday morning rattled
villages near China's Great Wall that were still recovering from a
devastating quake in January, government seismologists said.
	   There were no reports of casualties but a seismologist in Hebei
province's Zhangbei county said search teams were still
investigating outlying villages.
	   The first quake, of magnitude 4.6, occurred at 9:32 a.m. (0132
GMT) while the second, of magnitude 4.0, struck 75 minutes later,
state-run media reported.
	   The tremors toppled a few old houses already listing from the
magnitude-6.2 quake that struck Jan. 10, said a seismologist with
the State Seismological Bureau in Beijing. He refused to give his
name.
	   The powerful quake killed 50 and flattened villages along
Zhangbei's border with Shangyi county. More than 44,000 people were
left homeless and passed the bitterly cold winter living in tents
put up by the military.
	   Most of the homeless had moved into newly built houses by
Tuesday's quakes, although a few had not, said the Zhangbei
seismologist, who also refused to give his name.
	   The tremors, which the seismologists termed aftershocks from the
January quake, could be felt as far away as Beijing, 250 kilometers
(150 miles) to the south, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

Israel says apology over Hitler potato chip ads not enough 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Israeli diplomats held firm Tuesday
that commercials using images of Hitler to sell potato chips should
be pulled off Thai television and that an apology is not enough.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok,
said Israel will keep demanding that an ad campaign it views as
both offensive and morally unacceptable be halted.
	   ``We as a government are going to do all we can with the means
in our hands to stop this advertisement,'' Nil said. ``I think that
this is a moral issue.''
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai branch of the Chicago-based ad
agency, has apologized for producing the ads for X potato chips,
made by Food Processing Co. Ltd., a Thai company.
	   Simone Wheeler, an agency spokeswoman, said consultations were
still continuing with Food Processing over whether to pull the ads
and that a solution was expected at any time.
	   The commercials, which have aired only in Thailand, depict
Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cut to a woman who casts a voodoo
spell on him as he eats the chips, hoping to change his evil ways.
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   The agency has said that the commercial, targeting Thai
teen-agers, was meant to show that the world would be a better
place if happiness prevailed.
	   ``We appreciate that they see it's a mistake, but we want them
to stop the campaign,'' Nil said. ``For us, the idea of Hitler and
the Holocaust is not to be used at all to make money.''
	   Hitler unleashed World War II in Europe and systematically
murdered millions of civilians, including 6 million Jews, that his
Nazi regime considered subhuman, the worst genocide the world has
ever seen.
	   Consciousness about Hitler and his crimes is somewhat less in
Asia, where his armies did not reach, than in the West. Nil said
the controversy should have raised awareness about Hitler among
Thais.
	   Thailand has in the past expressed outrage over the use of
people dressed as Buddhist monks in advertisements. Buddhism is the
country's dominant religion and monks are generally revered.

Bishop wants troops out of East Timor; Habibie says they'll stay 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Nobel laureate Bishop Carlos Belo called
for the Indonesian army to withdraw from East Timor on Tuesday, one
day after Indonesia's new president said the government would
retain control of the island.
	   Belo, co-winner of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent
campaign to free East Timor from Indonesia's grip, said he intended
to travel to Jakarta and discuss troop withdrawals with new
President B.J. Habibie and Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie has said he has no intentions of changing the
government's policy on East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed a year later.
	   The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's claim to the
island, which was briefly an independent nation after the
Portuguese pulled out.
	   ``East Timor is an integral part of the republic. Nobody can
deny this fact,'' Jakarta's ambassador-at-large to East Timor, F.X.
Lopez da Cruz, said the president told him during a meeting on
Monday.
	   East Timorese resistance groups had held out hope that with the
fall of then President Suharto last month after 32 years of
autocratic rule, Indonesia's new government would change its policy
or at least relax its harsh administration of the island.
	   ``The are so many troops in East Timor, therefore, they have to
be withdrawn,'' Belo told a news conference at his residence in the
East Timor capital.
	   He said the military presence was hampering efforts to resolve
the island's status.
	   Indonesia has six army battalions on the island.
	   Human rights groups have also been demanding the release of East
Timorese rebel leader Jose Alexandre Gusmao, also known as Xanana,
from a Jakarta prison.
	   ``His release would be able to expedite the settlement of the
East Timor issue,'' Belo said.
	   U.S. congressman Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who
visited Gusmao in prison last week, has also called on the
government to release him along with other political prisoners.
	   Britain and several other countries have also asked for Gusmao's
release and for new negotiations on the territory's future.
	   Habibie has so far released four political prisoners jailed by
Suharto's regime. Officials say many of another 200 are to be freed
soon.
	   However, Gusmao's release, along with other imprisoned East
Timorese rebel fighters, seems far off.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was quoted by the Jakarta
Post on Tuesday as saying Gusmao was arrested on criminal charges,
including weapons possession, and so was not eligible for parole.

Police discover eight bodies in protracted factional feud 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police discovered grisly remains
Tuesday of eight men, their bodies stuffed into burlap sacks and
thrown in garbage dumps in a central neighborhood of the ethnically
troubled city of Karachi.
	   Police officials were still investigating the deaths, but they
said they feared it was related to an ongoing battle between rival
factions of a minority ethnic group called the Mohajir Qami
Movement.
	   The death toll in fighting between the two factions in the past
week soared to 19, following the discovery Tuesday of the eight
tortured bodies, said police.
	   The movement, which represents Muslims who settled in Pakistan
after independence in 1947, split several years ago and routinely
their members clash.
	   The larger faction, led by the exiled leader Altaf Hussein, says
eight of its activists were kidnapped over the weekend, but police
has so far not identified the eight bodies they found in the
central district.
	   Police have stepped up security in the central district of
Karachi, the scene of the latest gun battles. Most of the killings
have either involved drive-by shootings or gangland style
executions.
	   Factional fighting by movement members in the past year has left
hundreds of people dead in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city of 14
million people and its financial center.
	   Many of the people killed have been caught in the crossfire.
Paramilitary forces routinely patrol the city in armor-plated
trucks.

Stocks, currency down; official says inflation will fall 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stocks, currency falling, grafs 1-2
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stocks and the currency were
sliding again Tuesday, while a deputy prime minister tried to curb
bad inflation news by predicting price increases would slow in the
second half of the year.
	   The baht weakened to 42.25 to the U.S. dollar, tumbling from
41.55 Monday. It was the lowest level plumbed by the currency in 11
weeks and was attributed by dealers to fears of a deeper recession.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index meanwhile sank 1.37 points in
early trading to 311.67.
	   Supachai Patichpakdi, who is also commerce minister, said in an
interview late Monday on the ITV television station that declining
inflation would allow high interest rates to fall as well.
	   ``That will benefit the entire economic system,'' Supachai said,
without projecting any estimated figures.
	   High interest rates are crippling Thai businesses struggling to
survive the current recession, which the government said last week
will be far deeper and probably longer than previously expected.
	   The International Monetary Fund has demanded that Thailand keep
inflation at an average of 10.5 percent for the year as a condition
of receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package.
	   The economy has begun to stabilize under the administration of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but new declines in the currency and
stock market this week on fears of a deeper recession underscored
how far the country still has to go.
	   The Commerce Ministry released data Monday that showed Thai
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, the worst
inflation in more than three years. It was the fifth consecutive
month this year that the index has kept rising.
	   Inflation has worsened steadily since July 1997, when Thailand
abandoned its fixed-exchange rate system under attacks by currency
speculators and triggered a chain reaction of crises across Asia.

Dollar higher, stocks bounce back in Tokyo prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond, currency
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher in afternoon trading
Tuesday amid continuing pessimism about Japan's economy, though it
retreated from seven-year highs reached overnight in New York.
Tokyo stocks rose.
	   The dollar bought 139.48 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.36 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo. In New York overnight, the dollar settled at
139.70 yen, its highest level since June 24, 1991.
	   The dollar has gained steadily in recent weeks against the yen
as sluggish consumer spending and the write-off of some 76 trillion
yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad loans by the nation's banks cloud the
outlook for Japan's economy.
	   But the dollar ceded some of its gains in early Tokyo trading
amid a rising chorus of concern for the weakening yen by Japanese
finance officials.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told reporters Tuesday the yen
is too weak and Japan will take decisive action to defend it. The
same day, Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's international
finance bureau, said the pace of the Japanese currency's decline is
too fast.
	   ``In any case, I have strong concern about an excessively weak
yen, and we will take appropriate and decisive action against it,''
Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark index regained much of the
previous day's losses as sentiment improved after Monday's
announcement that Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese brokerage,
and Travelers Group of the United States were planning an equity
tie-up.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 233.42 points, or 1.52
percent, to close at 15,554.45. On Monday, the index had lost
349.75 points, or 2.23 percent.
	   ``The market welcomed Nikko's alliance, as it will likely
trigger more Japanese financial institutions' tie-ups with foreign
institutions,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   Deepening worries over the state of Japan's economy had
triggered Monday's fall.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,212.97. The
TOPIX fell 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.120 percent from Monday's record low
finish of 1.155 percent, driving its price up to 112.67 yen from
112.41 yen.

Homeless sculpture may head for container after Tiananmen anniversary 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ City officials on Tuesday turned down a request
to display permanently a sculpture honoring those slain in China's
1989 Tiananmen crackdown in any public venue, saying it was too
controversial.
	   Counselors voted 19-18 against exhibiting the eight-meter
(26-foot) bronze sculpture, named the ``Pillar of Shame'' by its
Danish creator Jens Galshiot, in any city park or museum.
	   Counselor Ip Kwok-chung of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, said it was too politically
controversial.
	   ``All displays should be non-controversial in nature because
people should not be forced to see'' something they don't agree
with, Ip said.
	   But Wu Chi-wai, who sponsored the motion for permanent display,
called the decision censorship. Wu is from the Democratic Party,
which is critical of Beijing and is pushing for more democracy in
Hong Kong. He said counselors like Ip ``don't want to see anything
that carries a political message, especially ones that are
anti-China.''
	   Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive after the handover to
China last July 1, appointed nine members of the council, and all
nine voted against displaying the sculpture.
	   The sculpture depicts 50 badly twisted faces symbolizing the
pain of the people, and carries a plaque saying ``How can old
people kill the youth?'' in Chinese.
	   It was shipped to Hong Kong last May for the annual candlelight
vigil to commemorate the bloody June 4, 1989, military crackdown in
Beijing.
	   The sculpture has been on display at Victoria Park, which
activists rented, since Sunday, when 2,700 people joined a
three-hour commemorative rally. Activists also have planned a
candlelight vigil on Thursday. Despite Hong Kong's handover to
China, there has been no effort to halt the rallies.
	   Szeto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance for Patriotic
Democratic Movement in China, said the group may be forced to put
the sculpture in a cargo container after Thursday night. Szeto, who
also is a Democratic counselor, said the group will apply for
temporary display, as well.
	   The sculpture has been on a tour of the territory's university
campuses since last June.
	   Outside City Hall on Tuesday, several protesters chanted
``Protect freedom of artistic expression. Against political
censorship.''

Sunni fundamentalist cleric dies of heart attack 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Sheik Saeed Shaaban, the firebrand Sunni
Muslim cleric who led an armed militia during the civil war and
advocated Islamic rule in Lebanon, died of a heart attack Monday
night. He was 69.
	   His Islamic Tawheed, or Unification Movement, said in a
statement Monday night that Shaaban suffered a heart attack after
returning home from evening prayers at a mosque in the northern
port city of Tripoli.
	   The white-bearded Shaaban, the ``emir'' of the Tawheed,
dominated the life of Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, in
the early 80s when the country was fractured into sectarian
mini-states.
	   He wrested control of Tripoli's streets from its moderate
traditional politicians and became a leading Sunni fundamentalist
in this Muslim-Christian nation of 3.2 million people.
	   In 1983, he sided with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his
PLO guerrillas who made a last stand in Tripoli before evacuating
by sea after a siege by Syrian-backed Lebanese leftist militias.
	   Shaaban later denounced Arafat and mended fences with Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
	   After the 1975-90 civil war, the white-turbaned cleric opposed
the consensus Christian-Muslim governments that ruled Lebanon and
continued to preach Islamic power.
	   But his own power base began to diminish as the army disarmed
militias and the state spread its authority over many parts of the
country.
	   In 1997, he was among the rare voices to criticize a visit to
Lebanon by Pope John Paul II that year.
	   He also defied a government order to close down his unlicensed
radio and television stations. One supporter was killed and four
were wounded in a clash in September with security forces who
closed down the station by force.
	   An activist in Muslim groups since the 1950s, Shaaban was one of
the founders of the fundamentalist Lebanese Islamic Grouping in
Lebanon in the 1980s.
	   He went to a French-language missionary school in Tripoli for
primary education and later studied religion at the Islamic
Academy. He traveled to Egypt for Arabic language education at the
Al-Azhar University.
	   He worked as a teacher in Algeria and Iraq and helped convert
Morocco's educational system from French to Arabic before returning
to Lebanon.
	   Shaaban is survived by his wife, Najah, five sons and two
daughters. A funeral will be held Tuesday afternoon in Tripoli,
where he will be buried.

Indonesia's new government recognizes independent labor union 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS estimates of Suharto worth, graf 11,12
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Keeping up the pace of reform, the
Indonesian government Tuesday formally recognized the country's
largest independent labor union, which had been suppressed under
ex-President Suharto.
	   Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris told reporters the Indonesian
Welfare Labor Union could now operate as a legal organization.
	   The union is headed by dissident Muchtar Pakpahan, one of four
political prisoners released by the government in recent days.
	   ``According to the labor laws, it meets all criteria to exist,''
the minister said after talks with President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie, formally Suharto's deputy, replaced the 76-year-old
autocrat on May 21 after the nation of 202 million people was
rocked by rioting and protests, sparked by the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   In his brief time in office, Habibie has promised to make big
economic and political changes, most notably a plan to liberalize
the tightly controlled political system and to hold elections in
1999.
	   During the Suharto era, human rights groups regularly criticized
Indonesia for suppressing workers' rights and allowing bosses to
pay unfair wages. Many employees were also forced to work in
sweatshop conditions.
	   Until his release last week, Pakpahan had been serving a
three-year sentence for allegedly organizing a workers' riot on the
island of Sumatra in 1994. Since his release, other charges of
subversion against him have been dropped.
	   On Monday, Indonesia's attorney general's office announced it
had launched a broad inquiry into corruption under Suharto's rule.
Among other things, it is expected to look at how Suharto's family
amassed billions of dollars through business deals based on their
position and power.
	   News reports said independent economist Christianto Wibisono had
estimated Suharto family wealth at a minimum of dlrs 20 billion,
based on the worth of companies and foundations controlled by them.
Other estimates have ranged up to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Critics have claimed that some of the fortune has been placed
abroad and should be brought back to help bailout the ailing
economy.
	   Despite continuing announcements of reform measures, some
students protesters, who played a key role in Suharto's ouster,
remain dissatisfied.
	   Less than 100 students staged a noisy but peaceful protest
outside Parliament on Tuesday calling for immediate elections.
Others have demanded Habibie, a long time friend of Suharto's, step
down immediately.
	   About 50 protesters also gathered outside the U.S. Embassy for a
second day to criticize tough reform demands being made by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The Washington-based IMF is now considering whether to restart a
dlrs 43 billion bailout package for Indonesia. The package was
derailed last month when political turmoil hit the world's fourth
most populous nation.

Cambodian leader says end of Khmer Rouge helps elections 
</HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen says that
upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993
monitored by 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers, thanks largely to the
collapse of the Khmer Rouge.
	   In an interview seen Tuesday in his monthly Cambodia New Vision
bulletin, Hun Sen said that security had greatly improved in the
past five years despite tensions that led to a bloody power
struggle with Prince Norodom Ranariddh last year.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh emerged from the 1993 polls as co-prime
ministers, but the prince was driven into exile by a Hun Sen-led
coup last July. Ranariddh came home two months ago to contest
elections called by Hun Sen to win his regime international aid and
legitimacy.
	   Hun Sen was quoted as saying that eligible voters were flocking
to register for the July 26 polls, proving that ``our people prefer
to choose a leadership by ballots rather than bullets.''
	   Critics say that the electoral process has been stacked in favor
of Hun Sen, though intimidation and killings of opposition party
workers appear to have calmed in the last month.
	   Hun Sen said that the atmosphere is far better than five years
ago, when U.N. peacekeepers were sent to Cambodia to help supervise
polls that cost dlrs 2 billion to organize and were aimed at ending
decades of civil war.
	   The Khmer Rouge, who caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979, remained a potent
guerrilla force in 1993 and boycotted the polls, threatening to
kill Cambodians who voted.
	   But turnout was massive and the rebel group has gradually
collapsed. Thousands of war-weary guerrillas have made peace since
1996 while die-hards have been pressed into a few hilltop enclaves
near the rugged border with Thailand.
	   ``In 1993, Khmer Rouge occupied many places ...,'' Hun Sen said.
``Those areas have been reintegrated one after another into the
royal government.''
	   Hun Sen said that the government will place 70,000 soldiers and
civilians at the disposal of the National Electoral Commission, the
body overseeing the polls, to ensure a stable election environment.
	   ``There will be no tanks, no armored vehicles, trenches or safe
havens as there were ... in 1993,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen welcomed the arrival of a handful of international
observers, saying their presence helped ``create an atmosphere of
confidence'' in efforts to organize the vote.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Sheik Saeed Shaaban, the firebrand Sunni
Muslim cleric who led an armed militia during the civil war and
advocated Islamic rule in Lebanon, has died. He was 69.
	   His Islamic Tawheed, or Unification Movement, said in a
statement Monday night that Shaaban suffered a heart attack after
returning home from evening prayers at a mosque in the northern
port city of Tripoli.
	   The white-bearded Shaaban, the ``emir'' of the Tawheed,
dominated the life of Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, in
the early 80s when the country was fractured into sectarian
mini-states.
	   He wrested control of Tripoli's streets from its moderate
traditional politicians and became a leading Sunni fundamentalist
in this Muslim-Christian nation of 3.2 million people.
	   In 1983, he sided with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his
PLO guerrillas who made a last stand in Tripoli before evacuating
by sea after a siege by Syrian-backed Lebanese leftist militias.
	   Shaaban later denounced Arafat and mended fences with Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
	   After the 1975-90 civil war, the white-turbaned cleric opposed
the consensus Christian-Muslim governments that ruled Lebanon and
continued to preach Islamic power.
	   But his own power base began to diminish as the army disarmed
militias and the state spread its authority over many parts of the
country.
	   In 1997, he was among the rare voices to criticize a visit to
Lebanon by Pope John Paul II.
	   He also defied a government order to close down his unlicensed
radio and television stations. One supporter was killed and four
were wounded in a clash in September with security forces who
closed down the station.
	   An activist in Muslim groups since the 1950s, Shaaban was one of
the founders of the fundamentalist Lebanese Islamic Grouping in the
1980s.
	   He went to a French-language missionary school in Tripoli for
primary education and later studied religion at the Islamic
Academy. He traveled to Egypt for Arabic language education at the
Al-Azhar University.
	   He worked as a teacher in Algeria and Iraq and helped convert
Morocco's educational system from French to Arabic before returning
to Lebanon.
	   Shaaban is survived by his wife, Najah, five sons and two
daughters. A funeral will be held Tuesday afternoon in Tripoli,
where he will be buried.

Netanyahu to visit Australia in August 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is likely to visit Australia later this year, probably in
August, Prime Minister John Howard told Parliament on Tuesday.
	   Howard confirmed a date around Aug. 14 was under consideration.
However, it is believed a possible clash with an Australian federal
election is preventing the date being finalized.
	   Howard promised to use the visit to lobby Netanyahu to continue
to seek a peace settlement with the Palestinians.
	   ``Israel carries a special responsibility, along with the
representatives of the Palestinian people, and I respect the rights
and the aspirations of the Palestinian people, and I will use my
opportunities and my authority to press that view on the prime
minister of Israel,'' Howard told Parliament.
	   ``I will certainly be pressing very strongly on the Israeli
government the need for it to play its part,'' he said.
	   But Howard said Australia's very strong view was that Israel had
a right to exist behind secure and defensible boundaries.

Taiwan detects submarine, reports say it's from China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Taiwanese military said Tuesday it
detected what it believed was a foreign submarine off the Penghu
island group last week, and reports identified the craft as
Chinese.
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ding said the navy and air
force detected two unidentified undersea objects on May 28.
	   ``The first was judged extremely likely to be a submarine, and
after it discovered we had targeted it and had it under
surveillance, it departed when sea conditions were right,'' Kung
told a news conference.
	   The military determined the other object was a sunken ship, he
said.
	   The United Daily News reported the submarine was a
diesel-powered Chinese submarine.
	   The Penghu islands, also known as the Pescadores, lie 43
kilometers (26 miles) off Taiwan's west coast in the Taiwan Strait,
about a half an air by air from Taipei. The Strait, which divides
Taiwan from China, ranges between 220 kilometers (136 miles) and
130 kilometers (80 miles) wide.
	   The official Central News Agency said a pair of navy support
ships discovered the submarine, and anti-submarine warplanes were
called in to pinpoint its location.
	   It said Chinese submarines frequent the area to listen in on
Taiwanese naval and air force target practice. The waters off of
the Penghu islands are a major Taiwanese military training area.
	   Anti-submarine warfare has become a major focus of Taiwan's
naval upgrade, and was a theme of this year's annual war games.
	   China threatens to use force to assert its claim of sovereignty
over Taiwan. Its fleet of submarines, including advanced Kilo class
subs purchased from Russia, would be key to enforcing a blockade of
the island. Taiwan has just two modern submarines.

Report: Philippine banks set for further consolidation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine banking industry is
heading for a further consolidation, creating a harsher business
climate that could drive weaker, smaller institutions into failure,
a report said Tuesday.
	   Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities Inc., in a report titled ``Banking
on the Brink,'' said the industry's major players should be able to
weather the regional financial storm because of their solid capital
base and established positions.
	   But a number of smaller banks are expected to fall as pressure
builds in the tougher operating environment, which will include
higher minimum capitalization requirements, it said.
	   The report said the Philippine banking system is solvent, unlike
in some other countries in the region.
	   Although the top 10 Philippine banks already account for some 60
percent of total assets in the banking system, the industry is
heading for further consolidation, it said.
	   This probably won't be achieved through mergers, but rather by
the historical norm of takeovers and acquisitions.
	   The report noted that in the first quarter of 1998, Orient
Commercial Banking Corp. became the first Philippine bank to close
since the regional financial crisis erupted in July 1997.
	   Orient Bank, one of the smallest of the country's 56 commercial
banks, shut down because of heavy withdrawals triggered by fears
that its majority owner was in difficulties.
	   The report said smaller commercial banks may have worsened their
situation by earlier efforts to gain market share that left them
with non-performing loans.
	   Numerous small banks were established in the Philippines in
recent years by inexperienced family corporations to ``service
their own business needs and their egos,'' the report said.
	   ``The current and expected operating environment should put
pressure on these corporations to divest their banking foray as
they will have to muster all their resources just to keep their
main line of business standing,'' it said.
	   The report says recent efforts by the Philippine Central Bank to
strengthen bank oversight should also contribute to a further
consolidation of the banking system.
	   These include increasing the capitalization requirement of
banks; additional loan-loss provisioning; and steps to more quickly
spot bad loans.
	   Of the top 48 banks, about 12 would have to increase their
capital if the first round of capitalization increases were
immediately implemented, the report said.
	   In the first round, general-service banks must raise their
minimum capital to 4.5 billion pesos (dlrs 115 million) from 2.5
billion pesos (dlrs 64 million) by the end of 1998 for non-listed
banks and by June 1999 for listed ones. A second round of increases
is planned for the end of 2000.

Pakistani executed in Emirates for murder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Pakistani man was executed
for robbing and then murdering a factory guard, a prison official
said Tuesday.
	   Ataullah Pir Mohammed, 31, convicted in the Dec. 1993 strangling
murder and robbery of Kanduth Zubair Kaidal, was killed by a firing
squad Monday, said the official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. He did not give the victim's nationality.
	   Mohammed strangled Kaidal 45, with electric cables, cut his
wrist and stole 71,000 dirhams (dlrs 19,500) from the safe of the
soft-drinks factory where he worked, the English-language Khaleej
Times reported Tuesday.
	   This was the first execution this year. The death penalty in the
Emirates can be imposed for murder and drug trafficking.

South Korean computer chip makers plan to cut production 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's computer memory chip
makers said Tuesday they were considering cutting production to
shore up falling global chip prices.
	   ``Because of a global supply glut, we agree in principle that we
must cut production,'' said Hong Kyong-tae, a spokesman of Samsung
Electronics Co., the world's largest memory chip producer.
	   The other two major chip makers _ Hyundai Electronics and LG
Semicon _ also admitted that the plunge in memory chip prices has
eroded their earnings, forcing them to consider measures to shore
up the prices.
	   On Tuesday, domestic news media reported that the three South
Korean producers may idle some of their production lines for four
days around South Korea's Memorial Day holiday Saturday, with
further cutbacks planned in the months ahead.
	   The three companies said they have yet to work out cutback
plans.
	   The three South Korean firms supply 40 percent of the world's
computer memory chips, called Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)
chips.
	   Japanese and U.S. chip makers have charged that South Korea's
rapid expansion of facilities resulted in the drastic price cuts.
South Korea put the blame on such new market entries as Taiwan.
	   South Korea currently produces 57 million 16-megabit DRAM chips
and 23 million 64-megabit DRAMs a year. Memory chips store
operating instructions for electronic products such as personal
computers.
	   In the first quarter of this year, South Korea sold its
64-megabit chips for around dlrs 9 each. At the same time last
year, it was getting dlrs 15 a chip.
	   In 1997, South Korea exported dlrs 17.5 billion worth of
semiconductors, or 12.8 percent of the country's total exports.

Sri Lanka troops kill 8 Tamil rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops killed eight Tamil
rebels during an attack on a guerilla position in the northern war
zone, the defense ministry said Tuesday.
	   The fatalities occurred Monday when the troops attacked a rebel
position on a strategic highway near the rebel-held town of
Mankulam, said Colonel Ranjith Withana, the military spokesman.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report as the
government bars journalists from visiting war zones.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for the
minority Tamils, saying they face discrimination in Sinhalese
majority Sri Lanka. More than 52,000 people have died in the
15-year war.
	   Government efforts to control the highway, which links the Tamil
heartland of Jaffna with the rest of Sri Lanka, has been stalled
near Mankulam for several months. Government troops have not been
able to dislodge the rebels from the town which is on the highway.
Mankulam is 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Colombo.
	   Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold, was captured by the army two
years ago. Since then, Jaffna's 500,000 residents have had to rely
on air and sea deliveries for food and other supplies because the
rebels control the highway which is the only land route to the
area.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's top national
security aide held talks with Chinese leaders Tuesday on Clinton's
planned Beijing summit with President Jiang Zemin late this month.
	   Clinton plans to visit China despite growing criticisms in
Congress that could hinder his ability to reach agreements with
Chinese leaders. A Senate leader warned Monday that approval for
renewing annual China's low-tariff trade terms was in doubt.
	   U.S. Embassy officials said National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger was here to prepare for the summit, but refused to discuss
specifics. One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
proposed agreements Clinton and Jiang or their aides might sign at
the summit were all ``in flux.''
	   India's and Pakistan's nuclear testing added urgency to Berger's
meetings and opened up another area for potential cooperation
between Washington and Beijing, said the diplomat.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan are to discuss ways to stem a South Asian nuclear arms
race with the British, Russian and French foreign ministers in
Geneva on Thursday.
	   Berger met with Liu Huaqiu, the security issues expert for
China's State Council, or Cabinet, Tuesday morning. He was to see
President Jiang and Foreign Minister Tang among others before
leaving Beijing late Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said at a briefing.
	   Zhu said the meetings also covered ``international issues of
shared concern,'' but would not give details.
	   U.S. and Chinese officials have been shuttling across the
Pacific to arrange Clinton's China trip, the first by a U.S.
president in nine years. Despite the high-level diplomacy,
differences on substantive issues _ trade, Taiwan, human rights and
Tibet _ remain to be bridged.
	   Chinese leaders, who are keen to use summit pageantry to boost
domestic support, also want Clinton to make a strong statement
limiting U.S. support for Taiwan. U.S. officials say a deal on
China's entry to the World Trade Organization is unlikely, barring
last-minute market-opening concessions.
	   The atmosphere for witnessing big money business contract
signing may be spoiled by congressional inquiries questioning
Clinton's dealings with China. The investigations are looking into
alleged Chinese donations to Clinton's Democrats and whether U.S.
satellite deals he approved helped China upgrade its ballistic
missiles.
	   Trent Lott, leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said
Monday in Washington that the controversies put in jeopardy the
annual extension of China's low-tariff trade status.
	   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said the president will make a
strong defense for continuing the most-favored-nation trade status
by Wednesday's deadline.
	   Zhu, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Washington's
annual review of low-tariff trade terms for China was an ``outmoded
practice'' that was ``not conducive to smooth trade relations.''
Beijing hopes Washington makes most-favored-nation trade status
permanent as soon as possible, he said.

Russian president to confer with businessmen over market drop

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trying to halt the slide in Russia's financial
markets, President Boris Yeltsin summoned the country's most
powerful businessmen and law enforcement officials to the Kremlin
on Tuesday.
	   The government said the president's meeting with the 10 business
leaders had been scheduled a month ago, but nonetheless Russia's
deepening financial crisis would be the top item on the agenda.
	   Investors continued to flee Russian markets on Monday, despite
government efforts to entice them back, including interest rates as
high as 150 percent. The main stock index dropped another 10
percent, down a total of 44 percent from the beginning of May.
	   The ruble remained stable at around 6.18 to the dollar. But the
Central Bank has spent down its reserves to bolster the price in
recent weeks and it was not clear how long they would hold out.
	   Yeltsin's meetings were apparently aimed at conferring with law
enforcement officials about Russia's pitiful tax collection system,
which is a major cause of the federal deficit.
	   The businessmen invited to the Kremlin head Russia's
increasingly powerful banking, business and media conglomerates.
The ``oligarchs,'' as they are known, were expected to give the
president their ideas for coordinated efforts to improve the
situation, the Kremlin said.
	   Investors' panic began last week, triggered by reverberations
from the Asian financial crisis, a wave of workers' strikes, and a
drop in world oil and gas prices. Russia is heavily dependent on
oil and gas exports.
	   The Russian stock market, whose performance was the world's best
last year, has reversed its fortunes and so far is this year's
worst-performing exchange.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund, similar to the ones arranged
after Asia's financial crisis hit last year.
	   But Russian officials have had trouble meeting the stiff
conditions that accompany such aid. The IMF has held up recent
installments of the loan to try and force Russian compliance with
the terms, which include improved tax collection and limits on
government spending.
	   Moreover, the government doesn't want to worsen the appearance
of crisis, and argues that Russia's underlying economic indicators
remain steady: the economy grew a nominal 0.8 percent last year,
and inflation is in the single digits.
	   As a result, the financial crisis has so far affected only
investors and its effects have not yet reached ordinary Russians.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Monday that
economic growth predicted for this year probably would not
materialize, but was optimistic that the country could cope with
the current crisis.
	   ``If the government is able to quickly and effectively eliminate
the consequences of the past week, the stability of the real sector
of the economy will be preserved,'' he told a news conference.

Malaysia's prime minister says Asia strong, backs bigger role for yen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Tuesday the turmoil in Asia and the depreciation of regional
currencies do not reflect the strength of the area's economies.
	   ``The currencies plunged even though the economies were very
strong. The fall was not a function of basic economic
fundamentals,'' Mahathir said at a symposium in Tokyo.
	   Mahathir, who arrived in Japan Monday, called for changes to the
international financial system to curb currency speculation that is
disruptive to world trade.
	   ``The international financial system should be developed in
order to contain the activities of those who buy and sell foreign
currencies for no other reason than making profit,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir said Japan should assume a role of leadership in Asia
to help Asian countries overcome the current crisis. ``Japan should
invest in East Asia. Japan should buy Asian products in order to
enrich Asia.''
	   But he added, ``East Asia is still looking east.''
	   Mahathir welcomed Japan's plans to boost the
internationalization of the yen but shied away from committing to
any plan to peg the Malaysian ringgit to the yen.
	   Nevertheless, he said it would be beneficial for Malaysia to
increase its yen-based trade. Noting that 18 percent of Malaysia's
trade is with the United States, but that 70 percent of its trade
is conducted in dollars, Mahathir said he advocated using the
currency of his trading partners.
	   Mahathir also admitted that his country is hesitant to fully
embrace International Monetary Fund reforms because of the
potential negative impact on the country's businesses.
	   ``We try to follow the IMF,'' he said. ``But when you raise
interest rates and taxes, the result is that companies go
bankrupt.''
	   ``Then the government goes bankrupt because we rely on taxes,''
he added.

Another theft of military equipment has officials rattled 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Thieves made off with 20,000
rounds of ammunition from an army truck and the two drivers were
missing, in the second large-scale robbery of military equipment in
two weeks.
	   With national elections to be held next year, authorities fear
the thefts may be linked to possible plans by right-wing elements
in the military or radical blacks to destabilize the country.
	   On Monday, the truck was found on the shoulder of a highway near
Bloemfontein, a city in central South Africa, with its cargo of
8,0000 rounds of 5.56mm and 12,0000 rounds of .22 caliber
ammunition missing, said Lt. Col. Margaret Neethling. She said the
drivers, both corporals, were also gone.
	   ``This is a huge shock,'' Neethling said. ``We are extremely
worried about the safety of the two drivers and appeal to anybody
who might have seen the incident to phone the police immediately.''
	   On May 20, 117 weapons, including mortars, rocket launchers and
machine guns, were stolen from the 44 Parachute Brigade in
Bloemfontein.
	   There was no immediate indication if the two robberies were
linked. Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda, the military's first black armed
forces chief who assumed command last Friday, said he expected a
report on the earlier theft this week. The report had not been
submitted to him by early Tuesday.
	   Last weekend, authorities reported 66 ammunition clips had been
stolen from the same parachute brigade. But on Monday, authorities
said that although burglar bars had been cut away at a weapons
storeroom, the magazines had been issued to soldiers for a training
exercise and were not missing.

With contraceptive costs rising, Indonesia fears baby boom 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TORCHIA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Factories are shut, layoffs are rife,
investors are aloof. Now Indonesia's economic crisis has turned on
a new target: population control.
	   With the price of contraceptives soaring, people are dropping
out of government-backed family planning programs in the nation of
202 million people, the world's fourth most populous.
	   In March, about 443,500 people registered with national
population control programs, down 5,000 from the previous month,
according to government figures.
	   ``People now have to use their money to buy daily essentials
rather than contraceptives,'' The Jakarta Post on Tuesday quoted
Ida Bagus Oka, the state minister of population, as saying.
	   ``This observation has invoked worries of another baby boom era.
It's sure to come if the problem is not immediately addressed,''
Oka said.
	   Indonesia has won international praise for its efforts to curb
population growth by distributing free and subsidized
contraceptives. The annual growth rate has declined from 2.32
percent in the 1980s to 1.6 percent.
	   But people are reluctant to buy contraceptives which are up to
five times more expensive than before the economic crisis hit last
year, Oka said. Most contraceptive materials are imported, making
them more costly because the rupiah is weak against the dollar.
	   The cost of a government-issued package of three condoms has
doubled to 1,000 rupiah (10 U.S. cents).

French student killed as bus overturns on Spanish highway 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A teenage girl was killed and 15 others
injured when a bus carrying French students overturned on a highway
in northeastern Spain on Tuesday, police said.
	   The girl, said to be 15 years of age, was not identified. Police
said two of the 15 other students injured were in serious
condition.
	   Besides one driver, the bus was carrying 44 students and three
assistants when the accident happened shortly before 6 a.m. (0400
gmt) close to the town of Figueras, just 40 kilometers (25 miles)
south of the French border.
	   No other vehicle was involved. A police spokesman said the cause
of the accident was not immediately known.
	   The 28 students who were uninjured were returned to France while
the other 15 were being treated in a hospital in Figueras.
	   News reports said the students were on their way to a summer
course at the northeastern Spanish town of Sabadell.

Kia workers on strike as government prepares to sell the car firm 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Kia Motors Corp. workers walked off
their jobs for the second straight day Tuesday as the government
prepared to sell the bankrupt firm at auction.
	   Ford Motor Co. of the United States was among several takeover
candidates.
	   Kia's 20,000 unionized workers went on strike Monday, demanding
that the company pay overdue wages and guarantee job security after
the bidding. Kia workers have been paid only half of their wages
since last July.
	   Kia Motors, once the nation's second largest car firm, is under
court receivership after going bankrupt last July under the weight
of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   Industry Minister Park Tae-young said in a published interview
Tuesday that creditors of Kia will announce a bidding schedule for
the troubled carmaker later this month.
	   ``It is desirable for the most competitive bidder to win the
deal, local or foreign,'' Park said in the interview with the
Moonhwa Ilbo newspaper in Seoul.
	   Moonhwa and other local media reported that calls for bids will
go out in late July.
	   The government is the largest stockholder of Kia, with a 30
percent stake. Ford holds 16.9 percent, with remaining shares split
by thousands of small investors, including Kia employees.
	   The government-appointed caretaker president of Kia, Yoo
Jong-ryul, told a news conference Tuesday that Ford has recently
proposed taking over the Korean firm by increasing its stake up to
51 percent.
	   Under the proposal, Ford would form a consortium with other
foreign companies such as Mazda Motor Co. of Japan to increase its
share and participate in Kia's decision-making process, Yoo said.
	   Yoo, named to head Kia in April, said he will visit Japan soon
to discuss the matter with Wayne Booker, a Ford vice president in
charge of the American firm's Japanese operations.
	   Three South Korean conglomerates _ Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung _
have expressed interest in Kia, which produced about 780,000 cars
last year.

Mir running smoothly ahead of docking with U.S. shuttle 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo planned
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Mir space station held steady in its
orbit Tuesday after its crew fixed a computer failure which
threatened to delay its planned docking with a U.S. shuttle.
	   Space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off Tuesday night
and dock with the station Thursday to pick up astronaut Andrew
Thomas, the seventh and last American to live on the Russian space
outpost.
	   NASA considered canceling the hookup after Mir's central
computer broke down on Saturday, destabilizing its flight.
	   After three tense days of repairs, Russian cosmonauts Talgat
Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin managed to get the computer back on
line late Monday and quickly reactivated the station's automatic
steering system.
	   ``Mir is now running smoothly and nothing prevents the planned
docking with Discovery,'' said Russian Mission Control spokesman
Valery Lyndin.
	   He added, however, that the station is now maintaining its
alignment using thrusters, which use precious fuel. It will take
until late Tuesday to switch on all of Mir's 11 gyroscopes _ the
station's preferred, fuel-free orientation system.
	   ``The station can stay on thrusters for quite a while, so even
if there is a problem with the gyroscopes the docking won't be
jeopardized,'' Lyndin said.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply dwindles
since it can't rotate to keep its solar panels in full alignment
with the sun.
	   Luckily, when the latest trouble occurred, the station was on a
so-called solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight round the
clock. As a result, Mir's batteries remained fully charged, making
it easier to reactivate the steering system.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a previous shuttle
flight in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months
of trouble-free operation.
	   The station's crew has replaced it with a back-up computer
brought up by a Russian cargo ship but the new unit also failed on
Sunday when the crew attempted to switch it on.
	   Speaking in a radio hookup with ground controllers early
Tuesday, Mir's commander Talgat Musabayev said that ``everything is
now normal'' on Mir and reported that the crew was busy making
final preparations for the docking.
	   Musabayev also complained that media reports of the latest
computer breakdown were blown out of proportion.
	   Russia plans to bring down the 12-year-old Mir at the end of
1999 after the first parts of the international space station are
in orbit.

Report: Plans made for equitizing state enterprises 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Ministry of Industry plans to sell off
46 state-owned enterprises under its management in 1998-99, while
Ho Chi Minh City intends to sell 96, the Vietnam Economic Times
reported Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Industry entities include 10 that make garments
or textiles, nine in the chemical industry, five that make
machinery and four in information technology and electronics, the
report said.
	   Ho Chi Minh City officials said all of the enterprises it plans
to equitize are making profits. A report from the local People's
Committee on May 14 said 340 of the city's 392 state-owned
enterprises were operating in the black.

Sanctions seen as limited With US-Pakistan-India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian financial planners maintained
Tuesday that anti-nuclear sanctions will have only a limited effect
on a nation struggling to climb out of an economic valley.
	   The United States, Australia, Japan and other countries have cut
off loans and all but humanitarian aid to punish India for setting
off five nuclear tests last month.
	   Indian Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia, quoted by Dow
Jones Newswires, said it appeared state-owned Indian corporations
can still borrow from U.S. banks. Only direct investment to the
government in the form of treasury bills and government bonds is
affected, he said.
	   ``There is nothing to stop (Indian) access to international
capital markets,'' Ahluwalia said. ``How people view the Indian
economy'' will affect the rates for Indian paper.
	   Both Ahluwalia and Revenue Secretary N.K. Singh were quoted as
saying they don't yet have enough information from Washington about
which U.S. items, particularly high technology goods, might be put
out of India's reach or how the Indian government will interact
with U.S. companies and government agencies in the future.
	   The sanctions colored the Indian budget presented to Parliament
Monday. Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha prefaced his budget speech
by saying he believed the sanctions ``will not have any significant
impact on our economic development,'' in part because he believed
the United States and other countries would ``moderate'' their
opposition in time.
	   Sinha, facing faltering growth and a widening deficit, proposed
spending on infrastructure to get the economy moving. He also
promised a ``hassle-free procedure'' for foreign investors, and the
sell-off of the government's interest in Indian Airlines and
several energy companies to raise funds.

Stocks bounce back, dollar higher in Tokyo prices; ADDS byline

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded Tuesday as news of a
tie-up between a major Japanese and U.S. financial companies
boosted optimism about more such links in the future. The dollar
rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 233.42 points, or 1.52
percent, to close at 15,554.45. On Monday, pessimism about the
economy drove the benchmark index down 349.75 points, or 2.23
percent.
	   The dollar bought 139.25 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.13
yen from late Monday in Tokyo. In New York overnight, the dollar
settled at 139.70 yen, its highest level since June 24, 1991.
	   Nikko Securities Co. was among the day's biggest gainers, ending
up almost 8 percent. Travelers Group, the world's largest financial
company, announced Monday that it was taking a 25 percent stake in
Japan's No. 3 brokerage, which had been struggling.
	   The tie-up with the more sophisticated foreign financial
behemoth is seen as ensuring Nikko's survival as deregulation stirs
competition in Japanese markets.
	   Shares of other Japanese financial companies also jumped as
speculation spread they, too, might turn to a stronger foreign
partner for help. Daiwa Securities Co. and Kokusai Securities Co.,
seen as two likely candidates, ended higher.
	   ``The market welcomed Nikko's alliance, as it will likely
trigger more Japanese financial institutions' tie-ups with foreign
institutions,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock
division at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   Trading was sparse with an estimated 290 million shares trading
on the first section, down from Monday's 331 million. Gaining
issues outnumbered decliners 2-to-1.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,212.97. The
TOPIX fell 24.79 points, or 2.03 percent on Monday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar edged
higher against the yen as concern about Japan's economy continued
to undercut the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar has gained steadily in recent weeks against the yen
as sluggish consumer spending and the write-off of some 76 trillion
yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad loans by the nation's banks cloud the
outlook for Japan's economy.
	   But in Tokyo, the dollar later ceded some of its New York gains
amid a rising chorus of concern for the weakening yen by Japanese
finance officials.
	   Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told reporters Tuesday the yen
is too weak and Japan is ready to take decisive action to defend
it. The same day, Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the ministry's
international finance bureau, said the pace of the Japanese
currency's decline is too fast.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.130 percent from Monday's record low
finish of 1.155 percent, driving its price up to 112.59 yen from
112.41 yen.

Israel says apology over Hitler potato chip ads not enough 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Thai consumer, ad associations approached, 10th
graf
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Israeli diplomats held firm Tuesday
that commercials using images of Hitler to sell potato chips should
be pulled off Thai television and that an apology is not enough.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok,
said Israel will keep demanding that an ad campaign it views as
both offensive and morally unacceptable be halted.
	   ``We as a government are going to do all we can with the means
in our hands to stop this advertisement,'' Nil said. ``I think that
this is a moral issue.''
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai branch of the Chicago-based ad
agency, has apologized for producing the ads for X potato chips,
made by Food Processing Co. Ltd., a Thai company.
	   Simone Wheeler, an agency spokeswoman, said consultations were
still continuing with Food Processing over whether to pull the ads
and that a solution was expected at any time.
	   The commercials, which have aired only in Thailand, depict
Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman who casts a voodoo
spell on him as he eats the chips, hoping to change his evil ways.
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   The agency has said that the commercial, targeting Thai
teen-agers, was meant to show that the world would be a better
place if happiness prevailed.
	   ``We appreciate that they see it's a mistake, but we want them
to stop the campaign,'' Nil said. ``For us, the idea of Hitler and
the Holocaust is not to be used at all to make money.''
	   Nil said the embassy had asked the Thai consumer and advertising
associations to use its authority to stop the ads.
	   Hitler unleashed World War II in Europe and systematically
murdered millions of civilians, including 6 million Jews, that his
Nazi regime considered subhuman, the worst genocide the world has
ever seen.
	   Consciousness about Hitler and his crimes is somewhat less in
Asia, where his armies did not reach, than in the West. Nil said
the controversy should have raised awareness about Hitler among
Thais.
	   Thailand has in the past expressed outrage over the use of
people dressed as Buddhist monks in advertisements. Buddhism is the
country's dominant religion and monks are generally revered.

Russian ex-premier to run for parliament 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former premier Viktor Chernomyrdin announced
Tuesday that he will run for a seat in the Russian parliament to
represent an Arctic region rich in natural gas, aides said Tuesday.
	   The region, Yamalo-Nenets, is a stronghold of Russia's natural
gas monopoly Gazprom, which Chernomyrdin headed before becoming
premier.
	   President Boris Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin and his entire
Cabinet in March and replaced them with a new, younger team ordered
to move faster on economic reforms.
	   Chernomyrdin will compete for a seat in the parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, in local elections Sept. 27, aides in his
party, Our Home is Russia, told the Interfax news agency.

Sydney Olympics to cost U.S. 4.15 billion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The state government estimated the
total cost of staging Sydney 2000 Olympics at 6.7 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.15 billion) in its latest budget
Tuesday.
	   The figure takes in Aust dlrs 2.3 billion (U.S. 1.43 billion)
being spent by the self-funding Sydney Organising Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG), Aust dlrs 1.1 billion (U.S. dlrs 680
million) in private sector infrastructure development, Aust dlrs
2.2 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.36 billion) in state government
infrastructure, Aust dlrs 750 million (U.S. dlrs 465 million) from
the federal government and more than Aust dlrs 400 million (U.S.
dlrs 248 million) in special outlays by state government
departments to meet additional transport, security and health
service demands.
	   The ``special outlays'' to state government departments were
included in the budget papers after pressure from state
Auditor-General Tony Harris, who had complained the full costs of
the Olympics had not been revealed to taxpayers.

Thai court approves extradition to US of alleged heroin chemist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai court has ruled that a man
accused of being a chemist for one of the world's biggest heroin
trafficking gangs may be extradited to the United States, a Thai
official said Tuesday.
	   The Appeals Court ruling Monday gives Washington three months to
arrange to transport Chukiat Nimitphakphum to the United States,
said the anti-narcotics official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Chukiat was one of 13 people arrested by Thai and U.S. officials
in a joint operation code-named Tiger Trap, which targeted members
of the organization formerly headed by Khun Sa, based in the
jungles of eastern Myanmar.
	   They were among 20 persons indicted by a U.S. federal court in
Pennsylvania on charges of conspiracy to smuggle 1,000 to 2,000
kilograms (2,200 to 4,400 pounds) of heroin to the United States
between May 7, 1990, and May 9, 1996.
	   Ten of the Tiger Trap suspects were arrested in Thailand in
November 1995, and the other three later, including one in China.
	   Several other suspects in the case have already been extradited
to the United States.
	   U.S. drug officials had described Khun Sa as one of the bcame from the
area.
	   Khun Sa surrendered himself and his personal army of more than
10,000 men to Myanmar authorities in January 1996. Although the
United States offered a dlrs 2 million reward for his capture,
Myanmar declined to extradite him and is not known to have pressed
any legal charges against him. He is reliably reported to be living
in seclusion in Myanmar's capital, Yangon.
	   In January 1996, Thailand extradited a Thai citizen to the
United States for the first time, and by March last year, Thai
officials said they had arrested a total of 31 drug suspects whose
extradition the United States has requested. Most of the Tiger Trap
suspects hold Thai nationality, although in some cases it may have
been illegally obtained.

Khomeini's works to go on the Internet

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The writings of Iran's late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who overthrew a king, thumbed his nose at the
United States and shook the Islamic world with his 1979 revolution,
will shortly be available on the Internet.
	   Iran's Tehran Time's daily reported Tuesday that more than 200
books written by Khomeini were ready to go on the net in Farsi, the
language of Iran.
	   It quoted Hamid Ansari, head of the institute that publishes
Khomeini's writings, as saying that some 100 of the revolutionary
leader's books would be available translated into 16 foreign
languages.
	   Iran is gearing up to the mark the ninth anniversary of
Khomeini's death. He died of cancer on June 3, 1989.
	   From his exile in France, Khomeini directed the Islamic
revolution that ousted the U.S.-supported Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in 1979.
	   The takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, in which Khomeini's
followers held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, led to one of the
United States' most serious diplomatic confrontations with any
country.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France moved into the second day of a strike
Tuesday, and the company president, due to hold talks later in the
day with aggrieved pilots, called for a truce to allow the World
Cup to go ahead smoothly.
	   Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta agreed Monday to meet
representatives of pilots' unions to discuss ending the strike
which otherwise could continue for at least two weeks, disrupting
the June 10-July 12 soccer tournament.
	   The meeting, the first since last-ditch talks broke down
Thursday, was scheduled for 3:30 p.m (1330 GMT).
	   In an interview published Tuesday with the newspaper Le
Parisien, Spinetta said ``there was still a lot of work to do'' to
reach an agreement with the pilots, and suggested postponing talks
until after the World Cup.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike.
	   The strike caused chaos for almost 100,000 passengers Monday,
worries for fans and teams attending the month-long World Cup
starting June 10 and embarrassment for all.
	   The state-run carrier's main pilots' union called the 15-day
action to protest against 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in
annual pay cuts. Most of the 3,200 Air France pilots did not work
Monday.
	   Departure screens at airports around the nation flashed the bad
news: ``annule'' and ``canceled'' next to list upon list of
flights. Air France planes, many decorated with giant paintings of
soccer players representing the 32 competing teams, sat idle.
	   Air France said there would be a slight improvement in traffic
Tuesday, with 16-18 percent of long-haul flights taking off,
compared to 10 percent Monday, and 32 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights scheduled.
	   In total, 44 more flights were scheduled Tuesday, compared to
Monday.
	   Air France, the World Cup's official carrier, is committed to
transporting teams to the 10 competition sites around France. The
company has said if the strike continues it will probably use
outside carriers to meet its obligations.
	   Air France, which almost went bankrupt in 1993, has given no
indication it is ready to withdraw a controversial plan to cut
pilots' salaries in exchange for shares in Air France.
	   Pilots also want Air France to do away with salary cuts for
starting pilots, a system in force for the past year.
	   The strike has left passengers stranded across France at the end
of a long holiday weekend. Lyon and Marseille, France's second and
third-largest cities and World Cup venues, were particularly hit,
as was Paris.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is sending the U.S. team on an American Airlines flight to Paris
that connects to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses for all their travel plans in France.

Australians concerned after poor training session 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby coach Rod Macqueen
and veteran hooker Phil Kearns expressed disappointment Tuesday
with the Wallabies preparation for Saturday's test against England.
	   The Wallabies struggled with set moves, support play and defense
in a full session at their Caloundra training camp.
	   ``We are running like a team that hasn't had a run together in a
long time,'' Kearns said. ``There are teething problems and we are
not expecting everything to be perfect on Saturday, it's just not
going to work out that way.
	   ``We are a pretty new test side as well. A lot of people are
selling England short and that's what's going to fire them on
Saturday, everyone writing them off.''
	   Macqueen told his players, gearing up for the first of 13 tests
this year, that they were not up to the level required.
	   ``They are understandably sloppy,'' Macqueen said. ``There's a
lot of communications problems we are sorting out. Whilst the guys
are football fit they have to fit in together as a team.''
	   New fly-half Stephen Larkham showed improvement from a day
earlier when his passing was off the mark and his combination with
scrum half George Gregan failed to gel.
	   That pairing has been pinpointed as a potential weakness by
former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer, one England would need to target if
it was to record an upset.
	   Gregan expected England would attempt to do just that.
	   ``It's an untried area in important positions on the field, I'm
sure they'll be coming at us through the halves and the midfield,''
Gregan said.
	   ``There will be a lot of pressure on us, it's a matter of making
sure we use our heads and coming up with a strategy to counter
it.''
	   Macqueen said Gregan had shown he could handle the attention.
	   ``George has been subjected to a fair bit of pressure this year
and he knows the same thing will happen this weekend,'' Macqueen
said.
	   Kearns has found the step up after three years away from
international rugby just as big as it was in 1989 when Dwyer
plucked him out of Randwick reserve grade to take on the All
Blacks.
	   The 30-year-old will play his 50th test against England.
	   ``I've only taken one step in getting back into the side but
I've got to stay there,'' Kearns said. ``With every training
session it starts feeling that little bit better but Test matches
are another level again.''

An overnight summary of Caribbean news DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Bomb explodes outside drug agency's headquarters 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A bomb exploded outside
the National Drug Control Directorate building in Santo Domingo
early Monday, leaving a bucket-sized crater in the pavement but
causing no injuries.
	   Police said the bomb exploded at 3:37 a.m., shattering windows
in the operations, accounting, psychology and training departments.
Explosives experts took samples from the site Monday morning.
	   There were no immediate arrests.
	   ``This action will not slow down the work that we are doing
against drug traffic,'' Luis Alberto Humeau Hidalgo, head of the
agency, said Monday afternoon. He said anti-drug efforts ``are
permanent at a national and international level.''
  VENEZUELA: OAS president says Cuba could be readmitted
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A ``new climate'' created by Pope John
Paul II's visit earlier this year to Cuba is making it more likely
that the communist-run island may rejoin the Organization of
American States, the OAS secretary-general said Monday.
	   ``It's clear for everyone that since the visit of John Paul II
to the island a new climate has been created in which this issue
can be addressed in a more constructive manner,'' Cesar Gaviria
said in opening the OAS' 28th general assembly.
	   If economic and political liberties and respect for human rights
are broadened on the island, ``it will be possible to consider the
return of Cuba to the Inter-American system,'' said Gaviria, the
former president of Colombia.
  PUERTO RICO: Group promises `war' to thwart telephone company sale
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican separatist group
responsible for bombings in the 1970s and 1980s on Monday promised
``war'' to prevent the sale of the public telephone utility to GTE
Corp. and other investors.
	   ``The sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Company is nothing more
than a declaration of war,'' the People's Boricua Army said in a
letter sent to the Associated Press. ``Now they will know what war
is.'
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello announced a dlrs 1.9 billion deal last week
to sell part of the telephone company to investors and give GTE
control over management. The sale must be approved by the Puerto
Rican legislature.
	   The telephone company's largest union voted Sunday to authorize
a strike to protest the sale, but no date was set.
  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Former president says he will never retire
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Former President
Joaquin Balaguer, who at 91 is still one of the most influential
Dominican power brokers, says he will stay active in politics
``until I die.''
	   Balaguer left open the possibility of running for president in
2000 despite physical frailty and near-blindness that forced him to
campaign for his party from the back seat of a limousine during May
municipal and congressional elections.
	   ``I swear to live for (my country) and I will do everything a
child of the motherland can do to bring it stability and the
greatest benefits possible,'' Balaguer said Sunday after his weekly
visit to his mother's tomb.
  CURACAO: New Dutch Antilles government sworn in
	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ After a five-month political
deadlock, a prime minister was sworn in Monday to head a new
government in the Netherlands Antilles.
	   Suzy Camelia-Romer, 38, is the youngest-ever prime minister of
the territory's five Caribbean islands: St. Maarten, St. Eustatius,
Saba, Bonaire and Curacao. Together, the islands are an autonomous
member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
	   Six political parties united to form the new government after
Jan. 30 elections failed to produce a clear winner.
	   The center-right Antillean Restructuring Party won four of 22
parliamentary seats in the elections, more than any other party but
not enough to govern. It was left out of the new coalition.
  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Victorious but leaderless, party searches for
candidate
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Victorious but
leaderless, the Dominican Revolutionary Party could begin searching
for a presidential candidate for the 2000 race as early as next
month, officials said.
	   The left-wing party's longtime leader and three-time
presidential hopeful, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, died on May 10 _
six days before his party swept the congressional elections.
	   Party leaders said Monday they want to choose a presidential
candidate early to give the movement time to heal any rifts. The
Revolutionary Party has a history of bitter divisions, and Pena
Gomez came out of retirement last year in a successful attempt to
hold the party together after its defeat in the 1996 presidential
race.
  UNITED STATES: Court appearance for Aruban man postponed
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A judge delayed until Thursday the arraignment of a
man federal agents say is one of the world's most prolific drug
money launderers.
	   Randolph Habibe, believed to have laundered more than dlrs 800
million in drug money since 1980, was to have had a first
appearance Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ted Bandstra. But
Bandstra granted a defense request for more time.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Troyer didn't object to the
request. Habibe, a businessman from the Caribbean island of Aruba,
was extradited to the United States last Friday, four and a half
years after his indictment.
	   According to his December 1993 indictment, Habibe laundered
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of money from drug sales.

Philippine privatization income under Ramos totals dlrs 2.3 billion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government received a
record 91 billion pesos (dlrs 2.3 billion) from the sale of
state-owned properties under President Fidel Ramos, officials said
Tuesday.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, who takes office June 30, plans
to eclipse that record with privatization revenues of about 100
billion pesos (dlrs 2.6 billion) during his six-year term.
	   Figures released Tuesday by the Department of Finance show
privatization revenues during the Ramos administration accounted
for most of the 114 billion pesos (dlrs 2.9 billion) received by
successive governments since the country embarked on a
privatization drive at the end of 1986.
	   Estrada hopes to use privatization receipts to make up for
shortfalls in tax revenues and also reduce costly subsidies to
often inefficient state-controlled companies. He has already
earmarked a number of large enterprises that are to be sold off.
	   These include Philippine National Bank, National Power Corp.,
Philippine Phosphate and Fertilizer Corp., and the Philippine
Associated and Smelting Corp. Smaller privatizations include
numerous media concerns.
	   A recent report by the Department of Finance credited the Ramos
administration's privatization program with contributing
substantially to the fiscal surplus posted by the government over
the past four years.
	   However, the International Monetary Fund has warned the
government not to rely too heavily on privatization proceeds as a
source of revenue.
	   Since the privatization program began 12 years ago, some 452
state entities with combined assets of 184 billion pesos (dlrs 4.7
billion) have been sold off.
	   Under Ramos, one of the biggest assets sold to the private
sector was the former Fort Bonifacio military camp for 39.2 billion
pesos (dlrs 1 billion). On the outskirts of Manila's financial
center of Makati, Fort Bonifacio is being developed as a business
and residential district.
	   Other large privatizations included Petron Corp., the country
biggest refiner, and National Steel Corp.
	   Estrada is eager to see National Power Corp. and Philippine
National Bank fully privatized this year.

Israeli defense minister meets Mubarak 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
met with Egypt's president Tuesday about the Middle East peace
process, which is stalemated by Israel's failure to accept a U.S.
compromise on a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Israeli radio reports said Mordechai was delivering news that
Israel was close to deciding on the U.S. plan. But the Israeli
daily Maariv said he hoped to convince President Hosni Mubarak to
scuttle a planned Arab summit to discuss Mideast peace.
	   Arab leaders have been discussing holding such a summit, but
they are torn by their usual squabbles between those wanting a
hard-line stance against Israel and others espousing a more
moderate line.
	   The hard-liners want to make good on a warning issued at a 1996
summit that Arab states would pull back from ties with Israel
unless Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept to pledges made in
peace pacts with Palestinians.
	   Mordechai said nothing to reporters when he arrived at Cairo
International Airport. He headed immediately to his talks with
Mubarak at the president's Unity Palace.
	   Reporters at the palace were told that the two were meeting
without aides.
	   The Israeli minister's trip comes a day after the Israeli
Cabinet discussed the U.S. compromise but announced no decision.
The compromise is an effort to restart Israeli-Palestinian talks
stalled since mid-1997 when Israel began a Jewish settlement in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The American plan, never made public but widely leaked, calls
for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent more of
West Bank land in exchange for Palestinians steps to increase
security for Israelis.
	   The Palestinians now have complete control over about 3 percent
of the land _ the cities and large towns _ and share control with
Israel over a further 23 percent. Under the U.S. plan they'd fully
hold 16 percent, with shared area remaining 23 percent.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who initially wanted a 30
percent withdrawal, has accepted the U.S. compromise.
	   The Iraqi-born Mordechai is viewed as on the moderate side of
Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet. He has urged a ``double-digit''
withdrawal, seen as a vote for the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel has argued pulling back from more than 9 percent of the
land would endanger its security. Jewish settlers, who want to
retain all the West Bank for Israel, have complained that a larger
pullback would isolate some of their settlements.

China says India `solely responsible' for arms race 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Tuesday blamed India for the nuclear
arms race in South Asia while muting criticism of staunch ally
Pakistan.
	   India was ``solely responsible'' because it tested nuclear bombs
first, and Pakistan's tests were a reaction to the nuclear threat
from India, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a
briefing.
	   India's five detonations in mid-May and a series of Pakistani
explosions last week has stirred fears of a nuclear arms race in
South Asia.
	   Beijing originally condemned India for its tests but throughout
the crisis has struck a more conciliatory line with Pakistan.
Chinese statements have noted Pakistan's security concerns, while
expressing ``regret'' over its nuclear response to India.
	   Beijing was particularly upset that the Indian government tried
to justify its tests by casting nuclear-power China as its main
threat. Relations between the two countries had been improving in
recent years despite a dispute over their border.
	   Although Zhu blamed India on Tuesday for starting the arms race,
he also urged both countries to heed growing worldwide support
against nuclear testing and proliferation.
	   ``We believe neither India's nuclear tests nor Pakistan's
conforms to the historical trend,'' Zhu said.
	   China calls on both countries to show ``maximum restraint'' and
``immediately abandon nuclear weapons development,'' Zhu said.
Beijing also is urging them to sign the Non-proliferation Treaty
and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said.
	   Zhu also repeated the government's denial of allegations that it
has helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons.
	   China has always been against the spread of nuclear weapons and
has not helped any country acquire them, he said.

Share prices close generally lower 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
lower Tuesday as investors remained concerned over the territory's
economic downturn.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 13.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 8,598.17. On Monday,
the index had tumbled 322.55 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.53 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
708 million), down from Monday's 6.52 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 835 million).
	   The index, which has been on an extended losing streak since
getting the word last week that the economy was heading toward
recession, shed 156 points by midday.
	   It regained most of its losses on selective bargain-hunting late
in the session.
	   After the government announced last Friday that Hong Kong's
economy shrank 2 percent in the first quarter, institutional
investors expect declines in the earnings of blue-chip companies,
said Kenny Tang, research manager at Tung Tai Securities.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 20 Hong Kong
cents to 35.40, and Cheung Kong was unchanged 39.70.
	   In the banking sector, Hang Seng Bank fell 2.00 dollars to
52.75, and HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar to 184.50.
	   Elsewhere, China Telecom fell 5 cents to 13.30, but Hong Kong
Electric rose 5 cents to 21.95.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's flagship airline has
deferred taking delivery of three Boeing airplanes for three to
four years, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   Stung by huge loses following the crash of the Malaysian
currency and the drop in passenger traffic because of the larger
Asian economic crisis, the Malaysian Airline System announced a
loss of 259.8 million rinngit (dlrs 66.6 million) in the year ended
March.
	   The three Boeing 747-400s may not be taken from the
Seattle-based manufacturer until 2002, said the spokeswoman.
	   During the last year, the company bought 10 Boeing aircraft of
various sizes.
	   Expecting a further decline of overall traffic, the company said
over the weekend it would review capacity requirements. It has
already suspended services to several European and Asian
destinations.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Tuesday the turmoil in Asia and the depreciation of regional
currencies do not reflect the strength of the area's economies.
	   ``The currencies plunged even though the economies were very
strong. The fall was not a function of basic economic
fundamentals,'' Mahathir said at a symposium in Tokyo.
	   Mahathir, who arrived in Japan Monday, called for changes to the
international financial system to curb currency speculation that is
disruptive to world trade.
	   ``The international financial system should be developed in
order to contain the activities of those who buy and sell foreign
currencies for no other reason than making profit,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir said Japan should assume a role of leadership in Asia
to help Asian countries overcome the current crisis. ``Japan should
invest in East Asia. Japan should buy Asian products in order to
enrich Asia.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's computer memory chip
makers said Tuesday they were considering cutting production to
shore up falling global chip prices.
	   ``Because of a global supply glut, we agree in principle that we
must cut production,'' said Hong Kyong-tae, a spokesman of Samsung
Electronics Co., the world's largest memory chip producer.
	   The other two major chip makers _ Hyundai Electronics and LG
Semicon _ also admitted that the plunge in memory chip prices has
eroded their earnings, forcing them to consider measures to shore
up the prices.
	   On Tuesday, domestic news media reported that the three South
Korean producers may idle some of their production lines for four
days around South Korea's Memorial Day holiday Saturday, with
further cutbacks planned in the months ahead.
	   The three companies said they have yet to work out cutback
plans.
	   The three South Korean firms supply 40 percent of the world's
computer memory chips, called Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)
chips.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Kia Motors Corp. workers walked off
their jobs for the second straight day Tuesday as the government
prepared to sell the bankrupt firm at auction.
	   Ford Motor Co. of the United States was among several takeover
candidates.
	   Kia's 20,000 unionized workers went on strike Monday, demanding
that the company pay overdue wages and guarantee job security after
the bidding. Kia workers have been paid only half of their wages
since last July.
	   Kia Motors, once the nation's second largest car firm, is under
court receivership after going bankrupt last July under the weight
of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   Industry Minister Park Tae-young said in a published interview
Tuesday that creditors of Kia will announce a bidding schedule for
the troubled carmaker later this month.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government received a

	   President-elect Joseph Estrada, who takes office June 30, plans

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine banking industry is
heading for a further consolidation, creating a harsher business
climate that could drive weaker, smaller institutions into failure,
a report said Tuesday.
	   Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities Inc., in a report titled ``Banking
on the Brink,'' said the industry's major players should be able to
weather the regional financial storm because of their solid capital
base and established positions.
	   But a number of smaller banks are expected to fall as pressure
builds in the tougher operating environment, which will include
higher minimum capitalization requirements, it said.
	   The report said the Philippine banking system is solvent, unlike
in some other countries in the region.
	   Although the top 10 Philippine banks already account for some 60
percent of total assets in the banking system, the industry is
heading for further consolidation, it said.

Decision in Japanese case against Marines expected this month 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A lawyer for two U.S. Marines facing assault and
conspiracy charges in Japan said Tuesday that a verdict is expected
later this month in the case, which has drawn criticism from three
U.S. congressmen.
	   Pfc. William Costello of Farmingdale, New Jersey, and Pvt. Rocky
Stubbs of Coshocton, Ohio, pleaded innocent at the opening of their
trial Monday in southern Japan's Okinawan District Court, said
lawyer Michael Griffith.
	   A decision is expected two weeks after court proceedings
conclude on Friday, Griffith said.
	   While the pair have acknowledged joining in a March 7 brawl
outside a bar in Okinawa frequented by U.S. military personnel,
they argue it was a matter of self-defense, the lawyer said.
	   The two Marines have already paid dlrs 4,600 in compensation to
a disc jockey who suffered a broken jaw.
	   The treatment of the Marines after their arrest, however, has
prompted a letter of complaint to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
from two U.S. senators and a House of Representatives member.
	   ``While we understand that these Marines are subject to Japanese
law, we are very concerned that their basic human rights and
dignity have been severely violated,'' said the letter signed by
Sen. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey, Sen. Mike
Dewine, a Republican from Ohio, and Rep. Christopher Smith, a
Republican from New Jersey.
	   Griffith said the Marines were interrogated without legal
representation during an initial 23-day detention period, a
provision allowed for in a U.S. military agreement with Japan.
	   The lawyer, who called for a revision of the so-called Status of
Forces Agreement with Japan, also said a bail application was
turned down and that the two men have faced harsh treatment in a
Japanese jail.
	   The March 7 fight allegedly broke out after a ``verbal
altercation over a cigarette,'' he said.
	   Okinawa, the southernmost island of the Japanese archipelago, is
home to about two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in
Japan.

At least 10 killed in rebel attack in northern Uganda 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed at least 10 people when
they ambushed three vehicles, including a Kampala-bound bus, in
northern Uganda, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said the attack by the Lord's
Resistance Army occured Monday at Dure near Kitgum, 450 kilometers
(280 miles) north of Kampala.
	   The independent daily Monitor said the attack occured at Akworo
in the same area, but both newspapers said dozens of people were
wounded in the attack.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain confirmation of the
reports from the government military spokesman.
	   LRA rebels struck in central Uganda two weeks ago in Lira
district, 125 kilometers (77 kilometers) south of Kitgum.
	   Initially, the Ugandan army said it had the Sudan-based rebels
surrounded. But later, spokesmen admitted the rebel force of
several hundred had managed to break out.
	   Monday's attack on the bus and two small trucks occurred on the
road from Lira to Kitgum.
	   The LRA has been battling the Ugandan army since 1987, turning
northern Gulu and Kitgum districts into no-go areas where at least
250,000 people have been grouped into so-called ``protected
villages.''
	   Northerners complain that the government of Yoweri Museveni is
not doing enough to protect them against LRA raiders who often
abduct children.

Dawson out of test 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England rugby captain Matt Dawson has
been ruled out of Saturday's test against Australia, furthering
damaging the weakened tourists' chances.
	   Dawson, who was leading a controversial 37-man squad with 20 new
caps, has pulled out because of a ligament strain.
	   ``The strain means that Matt will be 95 percent fit, but I am
only going to pick players who are 100 percent,'' said England
coach Clive Woodward on Tuesday.
	   Dawson was ruled out after Tuesday's training session and will
be replaced as captain by Saracens skipper Tony Diprose. Scott
Benton was brought into the side for his first test match.
	   Dawson was named captain after Lawrence Dallaglio ruled himself
out of the tour. He was due to win his 12th cap.
	   Benton, 23, was Dawson's understudy against Scotland and Ireland
in this year's Five Nations Championship.
	   England plays one test against Australia, two against New
Zealand and one against South Africa on its southern tour.
	   Many leading stars were left off the touring party, raising the
ire of officials in all three of their destination countries.

Five people injured in fracas between Turks and Kurds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Five people, including a French
policeman, were injured in a brawl between members of the Turkish
and Kurdish communities in the southern French city of Montpellier,
police said Tuesday.
	   About 40 people armed with pickaxes and iron bars clashed Sunday
and Monday in central Montpellier, completely destroying a bar.
	   Police used tear gas to separate the two groups.
	   One Turkish person who was waiting for medical treatment
received a further wound when he was shot while medical personnel
processed his admission to hospital.
	   About 1,000 people of Kurdish and Turkish origin live in
Montpellier, a city of about 200,000 in southern France.
	   Until now, police said there had been no reports of any major
altercations between the two communities.
	   Kurds in eastern Turkey have been fighting for autonomy from
Turkey.

Opposition leader thrown out of pub

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The leader of the opposition
Social Democrats has been thrown out of a pub in south Bohemia by
the landlord who said Milos Zeman was not a welcome guest in his
house, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Pravo daily said the incident happened Monday shortly after
noon when Zeman entered a pub in Ceske Budejovice, 150 kilometers
(93 miles) south of Prague.
	   Shortly after Zeman ordered lunch, Jiri Stritecky, owner of the
building where the restaurant is located, broke in and asked him to
leave, the daily said. It said Stritecky cited Zeman's ``bolshevik
opinions'' as the reason.
	   ``That's true,'' Pravo quoted Stritecky as saying. ``Mr. Zeman
is not a welcome guest in my house.''
	   Pravo said Zeman left the pub shortly after the incident.

Lawmaker to grill interior minister on inefficiency charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Muslim fundamentalist lawmaker has decided to
grill the interior minister in Parliament over alleged inefficiency
in fighting corruption, drugs and crime, Al-Qabas daily reported
Tuesday.
	   The minister, Sheik Mohammad al-Khaled al-Sabah, has ``horribly
failed'' in fulfilling his responsibilities in two years in office,
legislator Hussein al-Gallaf said in a document presented to the
50-seat house and published by Al-Qabas.
	   No date has been set for the questioning of the minister, a
member of the royal family.
	   Such questioning is unusual in Kuwait. In the last instance
earlier this year, Information Minister Sheik Saud al-Sabah
resigned to preempt a vote of no-confidence. But he was then
appointed oil minister in a reshuffle.
	   Al-Gallaf, a Shiite cleric, claimed Sheik Mohammad has failed to
catch ``big fish'' drug traffickers and concentrated on small-time
pushers and users. He said armed robberies have increased and
prostitution has become widespread in this conservative Muslim
society. He offered no statistics to support his argument.
	   The legislator also criticized what he called police ``brutality
and barbarity,'' saying suspects in custody are often tortured.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Separatist rebel bombed a vital railway
track and two bridges in India's northeastern Assam state Tuesday,
cutting the region off from the rest of the country, news agencies
reported.
	   Rebels of the Bodo Liberation Tiger group triggered a powerful
bomb on a railway bridge near Kokrajhar, Press Trust of India said.
The explosion badly damaged the bridge.
	   The two other explosions early Tuesday took place in Bongaigaon
and Nalbari districts in eastern Assam, PTI said.
	   Workers are trying to repair the damage but reports said it
would be at least two days before traffic could be restored in the
region.
	   The northeast, which is made up of seven small states, is
plagued by several guerrillas groups fighting to break away from
India.

Malaysian businessman shot dead in Mogadishu 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Four gunmen shot dead a Malaysian
businessman who was in partnership with Somalis in a
telecommunications business, a witness said Tuesday.
	   Mohamed Rashid Musa was walking from the offices of the Somali
Telecommunications Service in downtown Mogadishu late Monday when
the gunmen opened fired with automatic rifles, said the witness on
condition of anonymity. The gunmen then fled in a waiting vehicle
driven by a fifth man.
	   The vehicle later overturned, and the gunmen escaped on foot,
another witness said.
	   The driver, who was injured in the crash, was arrested by
militiamen loyal to faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who
controls most of south Mogadishu, the witness said.
	   The motive for the killing remained unclear, but a Somali
employee of the company said Rashid and his Somali partners had
business disagreements lately.
	   The Malaysians own 70 percent of the company and Somalis the
rest.
	   A former colonel in the Malaysian army, Musa served with UNOSOM,
the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia, between 1994 and 1995
and later returned as a civilian businessman.
	   Aidid and his family have business connections with Malaysians
and were behind the opening of the only functioning bank in Somalia
_ operated by Malaysians.
	   Somalia has had no government since faction leaders united to
ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, then turned on each
other as the country disintegrated into fiefdoms protected by
militias.

Government backs off on expulsion of illegal workers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Heeding employer fears that enough
Thais cannot be found to work in rice mills, officials in Thailand
said Tuesday they will extend a deadline for illegal foreign
workers to leave the country.
	   Som Suppanakorn, director general of the employment department
in the Thai Labor Ministry, said the government had decided the
mill workers can stay until the end of June. After that, they will
be subject to arrest and expulsion.
	   The Thai government has been trying to cope with rising
unemployment from a recent economic crisis by sending home an
estimated 300,000 illegal foreign workers to free up jobs for
Thais.
	   But in many industries, notably rice milling, fishing,
construction and other poorly paid, difficult jobs, employers have
sought exemptions. They say many Thais simply refuse such work.
	   Most of the illegal workers come from Myanmar.
	   Thailand is the world's top rice exporter and the politically
powerful Thai Rice Mill Association has been lobbying the
government hard to keep its foreign workers, whose job is mainly
lifting heavy rice sacks all day.
	   Bumrung Kritchpakorn, honorary president of the association,
told Down Jones Newswires that the government needed to help supply
Thai laborers to the industry.

Driver confesses in Gucci slaying, says real killer still at large 
</HEADLINE>
With AP photos
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The man who drove the getaway car in the
slaying of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci confessed Tuesday, but said
the real killer is still at large.
	   In dramatic courtroom testimony, Orazio Cicala said he was drawn
into the murder plot by Gucci's ex-wife, a high-society psychic and
a hotel doorman.
	   Then he dropped a bombshell by saying the accused triggerman is
innocent and the real gunman is still at large.
	   Cicala described the killer as a ``dolt'' he'd met when he was
dealing drugs, but said he was afraid to reveal his identity, the
ANSA news agency reported. ``I can't give you his name because I
have children and a family,'' he told the court.
	   For the first time, all five defendants appeared at the trial:
Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, her longtime
confident and spiritual adviser Giuseppina Auriemma, Milan hotel
doorman Ivano Savioni and alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo.
	   Gucci was shot dead March 27, 1995, as he walked into his office
building in downtown Milan. When his ex-wife was arrested in
January 1997, prosecutors alleged she had Gucci murdered because
he'd halved her alimony to dlrs 900,000 a year.
	   Reggiani Martinelli's lawyers said opening arguments that she
hated Gucci and often said she'd like to see him dead. But they
said a 1992 brain tumor operation had rendered incapable of
conceiving and carrying out the murder scheme.
	   They called it ``a psychological short-circuit'' that destroyed
her ``capacity for rational judgment.''

Philippine stocks suffer heavy losses, peso weakens 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES 2nd graf with peso closing lower.
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks plunged to a
four-month low Tuesday as most Asian stock markets continued to
reel from a selloff triggered by fears of a possible economic
recession sweeping the region, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed lower against the U.S. dollar but
fared noticeably better than other regional currencies pressured by
the weak Japanese yen.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 49.97 points,
or 2.5 percent, to 1,946.08. It was the index's lowest closing
level since Jan. 29, when it registered 1,796.68. On Monday, it
gave up 15.40 points.
	   Tuesday was the eighth straight session of losses by the market,
with the main index shedding 202.53 points, or 9.4 percent, during
the period.
	   Having broken its 1,950-support Tuesday, the index is expected
to test its next support level of 1,900 points, traders said.
	   Foremost among the danger signs which sidelined investors was
the weak performance of the Japanese yen against the dollar in
morning trading, dealers said.
	   Investors feared the weak yen may spawn another round of
devaluations of regional currencies. This is expected to further
undermine the already fragile state of most Asian economies, many
of which contracted in the first quarter, traders said.
	   An exception was the Philippines, whose gross national product
grew by 2.5 percent in the three-month period.
	   Taking its cue from the weak yen, the peso averaged 39.396 pesos
to a dollar, compared to Monday's 39.072 pesos.
	   Dealers said heavier losses by the peso continued to be averted
by weak corporate demand for dollars. The thin demand has helped
buffer the peso as other regional currencies have fallen.
	   However, the weak yen, which drove the Thai baht to a
three-month low in morning trading and pressured other regional
currencies, could still undermine the relative stability in the
peso-dollar rate, dealers said.
	   Despite the Philippines' peaceful and credible national
elections last month and economic growth in the first quarter,
foreign investors aren't inclined to view the country positively
given the regional situation, said Mitzi de Dios, trader for
ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett Securities Philippines Inc.
	   De Dios said as long as Asia cannot come up with a clean bill of
economic health, the Philippines will be unable to capitalize on
its inherent advantages.
	   ``Foreign investors, across the board, are pulling out. The
Philippines is still better off compared to its neighbors, but the
negative sentiment in the region is pulling us down,'' she said.

China's railways to slash workforce, costs in bid to cut losses 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's state-run railways will be reorganized
and downsized to help reduce costs and trim losses that have
climbed to 16 billion yuan (dlrs 1.9 billion) over the past four
years, the Chinese railways minister said Tuesday.
	   Railways are among many unprofitable state-owned industries that
are shedding workers in broad reforms intended to make China's
economy more competitive.
	   Like many other businesses, the railways are also hoping to
enlist more foreign investment and technology for what China
estimates to amount to a dlrs 350 billion market, including
upgrading of rail lines and purchases of locomotives and other
equipment.
	   Railways Minister Fu Zhihuan said that non-transport businesses
would be spun off into separate enterprise groups, allowing the
railways to focus on their core operations.
	   Ambitious projects are under way that would help open much of
the isolated inland areas in China's west and southwest.
	   Meanwhile, speed and services will be improved along main routes
such as the Beijing-Shanghai corridor, Fu said at a news conference
to publicize the railways' strategy for future development.
	   China has allocated dlrs 450 billion in the five years ending in
2000 to railways development, Fu said, adding that such projects
would receive preferential tax and tariff treatment.
	   Unable to keep pace with rapid growth in other industries,
China's railways have been a key bottleneck of the economy.
Meanwhile, government regulation of the strategically important
transport sector has hamstrung efficiency-enhancing reforms.
	   The railways, which employ a total 3.35 million workers in
transport and other related industries, reported losses of 4
billion yuan (dlrs 484.26 million) in 1997, bringing cumulative
losses to 16 billion yuan (dlrs 1.93 billion).
	   It was the fourth straight year of losses, and Fu predicted that
in 1998, the railways would remain in the red with losses of 1.2
billion yuan (dlrs 145.3 million).
	   With other state industries cutting production as they
restructure, demand for transport of coal _ which accounts for 43
percent of railroad revenues _ has plummeted.
	   Asked how the railways could hope to regain profitability while
industrial output slumps, Fu acknowledged that it could pose a
problem.
	   ``You are asking the question that has been troubling me day and
night,'' he said.
	   Fu said the railways hoped to compensate for that decline in
business, however, by boosting revenues from other freight and
passenger transport and by slashing costs.
	   By 2000, the Railways Ministry expects to turn a profit, in
keeping with Premier Zhu Rongji's vow to turn loss-making state
firms around within three years.
	   ``In the past, we operated rather inefficiently. There is plenty
of potential for improvement in costs,'' he said.
	   According to the Railways Ministry plan, of the 1.7 million
workers employed in rail transport, 300,000 are due to lose their
jobs by 2000. Overall, 1.1 million workers in related industries
will be laid off.

Romario dropped from Brazilian roster; Emerson called in as replacement

	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Romario, Brazil's hero from the 1994
World Cup and half of the defending champion's ``Ro-Ro'' forward
combination, was dropped from the side Tuesday, less than a day
before the final rosters were to be submitted to FIFA for France
'98.
	   An injury to his right calf muscle, incurred during training two
weeks ago before the team left Brazil, apparently had not healed
sufficiently for Romario to be ready for the tournament.
	   Midfielder Emerson of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen has been
called in to replace Romario, team officials announced
	   Coach Mario Zagallo made a brief announcement at the team's
training headquarters and then turned the press conference to
Romario, who was choked with tears and could not speak.
	   Romario, who was supposed to form the striking combination with
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo, will likely be replaced
in the starting lineup by Edmundo, but Zagallo would not comment on
the matter.
	   Romario trained by himself Saturday while the team was
traveling, and felt the injury to his right calf. An MRI on Sunday
revealed swelling in the muscle, which could take up to a month to
heal, team Dr. Lidio Toledo said Tuesday at the team's French
training headquarters.
	   A first MRI had revealed nothing serious, team officials said.
	   Monday night, Brazil's technical committee, comprised of
Zagallo, technical coordinator Zico and Toledo, met and decided to
drop Romario.
	   The decision to call in Emerson was based on the feeling that
Brazil was sufficiently stocked in forwards, having six that could
play the position, but that it could use help in backing up Dunga
or Cesar Sampaio.
	   Both had been slowed by injuries, but have recovered.
	   Romario was the hero of Brazil's 1994 World Cup title run,
scoring five goals to lead the team.

South Korea announces entry list for World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea announced a 22-man roster
for its World Cup squad Tuesday, including a teen-age rookie as
well as the comeback of veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong.
	   Hwang, 29, South Korea's most famous soccer player, returned to
the national team in April after a two-year break due to a knee
injury. He has since scored three goals in seven World Cup warmup
matches.
	   With 45 goals in 79 international matches, Hang also is the
country's most prolific scorer. He is to form a two-man forward
offense with Choi Yong-soo, another striker who scored seven goals
in as many Asian World Cup qualifiers.
	   A surprise pick was forward Lee Dong-kook. At 19, Lee became the
youngest South Korean ever to join the national soccer team. Coach
Cha Bum-keun said he was taking the rookie to France to train him
as South Korea's next-generation star.
	   Three of the players on the list now play in the Japanese league
_ forward Kim Do-hoon, midfielder Ha Seok-ju and defender Hong
Myung-bo.
	   Hong, frequently picked by soccer experts as Asia's best
defender, is the lynch pin in charge of South Korea's
defense-offense transition. He often surprises opponents by firing
powerful long-distance shots from unexpected angles.
	   Midfielder Seo Jung-won is coming from R.C. Strasbourg of the
French league, and Roh Jung-yoon from N.A.C. Breda of the
Netherlands.
	   The team leaves for France after playing its final tuneup match
against China on Thursday. In France, South Korea meets Mexico,
Belgium and the Netherlands in the first round of the 32-nation
World Cup finals.
  Roster  
	   Goalkeepers: Kim Byung-ji, Seo Dong-myung.
	   Defenders: Choi Young-il, Hong Myung-bo, Kim Tae-young, Lee
Min-sung, Jang Dae-il, Lee Sang-hun, Jang Hyung-seok, Lee Im-saeng.
	   Midfielders: Ha Seok-ju, Yoo Sang-chul, Kim Doh-keun, Choi
Sung-yong, Seo Jung-won, Ko Jong-soo, Lee Sang-yoon, Noh Jung-yoon.
	   Forwards: Kim Do-hoon, Hwang Sun-hong, Choi Yong-soo, Lee
Dong-kook.

Greenpeace activists arrested following oil rig protest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Six Greenpeace activists were arrested and
their ship ordered seized off Norway's west coast on Tuesday after
attempting a protest action against an offshore oil rig.
	   On Monday, another Greenpeace activist, 29-year-old Jacob
Hartmann of Denmark, was arrested after chaining himself to the
same drilling rig.
	   The protesters and their ship, the Stahlratte, as well as a
Norwegian coast guard vessel, were about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
off the western Norway port of Kristiansund. The rig is drilling an
exploratory well there for the Norwegian division of the Shell Oil
Company.
	   Police Chief Kjell Otto Lilleberg said six activists in rubber
boats attempted to reach the rig on Tuesday, and were arrested for
breaching the 500-meter (yard) security zone around all offshore
oil rigs.
	   ``I ordered their arrest and the seizure of their vessel, the
Stahlratte, which is to be brought to Kristiansund for a police
investigation,'' Lilleberg said by telephone.
	   Greenpeace claims there are already far more known reserves of
fossil fuels than can be burned without accelerating global
warming, so it is pointless to search for more. The group also
staged a brief protest Tuesday outside Shell's Norwegian offices in
the town of Stavanger.

Ruling Nationalists get electoral boost 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's embattled ruling Nationalist
Party got another boost Tuesday ahead of year-end elections when
the popular mayor of the country's second-largest city decided to
run for re-election.
	   Wu Den-yih's decision to enter the race in southern Kaohsiung
followed former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou's surprising
announcement last week that he will run for mayor of Taipei.
	   ``It will be a very positive development,'' Nationalist Party
Secretary General John Chang said of their decisions.
	   For months, both Wu and Ma have rebuffed attempts to draft them
as candidates. Their refusal was seen as a vote of no-confidence in
their party, which has been mired in criticism of alleged
corruption and suspected links with the Taiwanese underworld.
	   The Nationalists lost in last year's local elections, allowing
the Democratic Progressive Party, the main opposition, to govern 70
percent of Taiwan's population at the local level.
	   Newspapers said Wu, like Ma, changed his mind after a
last-minute appeal from colleagues who said he would ``go down in
history as a villain'' because his refusal to run could help hand
over power to the opposition.
	   The high-profile mayoral elections could have an impact on
results of legislative elections that will be held at the same time
in December.
	   The polls are seen as a test run for the presidential elections
in 2000, when a successor will be chosen for President Lee
Teng-hui. Lee plans to retire after 12 years in office.
	   ``I've decided to enter this race to continue with the past
efforts'' to improve Kaohsiung, Wu told a news conference.
	   Wu, Kaohsiung mayor since 1990, has attacked government red tape
and its failure to allocate resources to developing southern
Taiwan.
	   To win his consent to run, Premier Vincent Siew approved on
Monday night requests Wu made several years ago for funds to
rebuild a run-down village and the city's water system.
	   Wu will face former DPP lawmaker Frank Hsieh. In Taipei, Ma will
run against the powerful incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian.
	   A survey conducted by the private firm Louis Harris
International May 22-24 indicated the two races were even.
	   Many Nationalist supporters fear a DPP victory could increase
tension with China because of its history of advocating
independence.
	   Taiwan has been divided from China politically after the Chinese
civil war ended in 1949. China claims Taiwan is a renegade
province, and has threatened to use force against it if it declares
independence.

Cambodia leader says Khmer Rouge trial would be premature 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen said
Tuesday that Khmer Rouge guerrilla leaders should be tried for
crimes against humanity, but only after their organization is
completely destroyed.
	   Drawing a parallel to the Nazi war criminals, he noted that
``following World War II, the Hitlerites ... could be brought to
trial at Nuremberg only after their political and military
organizations had been dismantled.''
	   When they held power in the late 1970s, the radical policies of
the communist Khmer Rouge led to the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians through forced labor, disease and systematic executions.
	   Wracked by defections, their movement now appears to be on the
verge of total collapse. The group's longtime leader, Pol Pot, died
of a reported heart attack on April 15.
	   ``Although there is now news that Pol Pot is dead, still I
notice that Pol Pot's ideas are still being implemented by the
Khmer Rouge hard-liners as their guidelines for activities,'' Hun
Sen said in an interview published in his Cambodian New Vision
bulletin.
	   The Cambodian government has said it would still attempt to
seize surviving top Khmer Rouge leaders, including Nuon Chea, Ta
Mok and Khieu Samphan, so that they could stand trial in a
Cambodian court after the July 26 national elections.
	   Hun Sen said appeals to hold an international tribunal for Khmer
Rouge leaders were ``a trick aimed at preventing Cambodia from
achieving real peace.''
	   The ploy ``cannot be accepted, for it would only help the Khmer
Rouge to survive, while prolonging the sufferings of the Cambodian
people,'' he was quoted as saying.

Church of England among those profiting from Viagra-driven share rise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Church of England is among the shareholders
who have benefited from the rapid rise in share prices of Pfizer,
the American manufacturer of the impotence drug Viagra.
	   The Church Commissioners, who administer a portfolio of property
and equities valued at 3.5 billion pounds (dlrs 5.7 billion), have
a block of Pfizer shares worth about 1 million pounds, said Arun
Katariya, communications officer for the commissioners.
	   The commissioners have held the Pfizer stock at least since
1992, well before the recent jump in share prices, Katariya said
Tuesday.
	   In early 1995, Pfizer was trading at dlrs 19.06 a share. By the
end of 1995, the stock price had jumped up to dlrs 31.50.
Yesterday, it closed at dlrs 103.88.
	   The Church Commissioners last year contributed 130.5 million
pounds to the Church of England's total operating expenditure of
615 million pounds, Katariya said.

Russian president denounces poor tax collection, market rises Bank says reserves are up, market rebounds slightly, EDITS and TRIMS.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin denouncing tax system, Central
AP Photos planned
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced his staff
Tuesday for failing to fulfill one of government's key tasks:
collecting taxes.
	   ``The tax situation has not improved, only worsened, especially
in recent months,'' a gruff-sounding Yeltsin told law enforcement
officials in a Kremlin meeting broadcast on national television.
	   Russia's pitiful tax collection system is at the heart of the
country's current financial crisis, which worsened Monday when the
stock market dropped another 10 percent. Altogether, the market has
fallen 44 percent in the past month.
	   However, the market rebounded slightly by midday Tuesday, and
was up 4 percent from Monday's close.
	   Trying to halt the slide in Russia's financial markets, Yeltsin
summoned government and business leaders to confer with him
Tuesday.
	   Chief among them were 10 heads of Russia's powerful banking,
business and media conglomerates. The ``oligarchs,'' as they are
known, were expected to give the president their ideas for
coordinated efforts to ease the crisis.
	   Yeltsin planned to have a ``sharp talk'' with them, the Interfax
news agency quoted the president as saying.
	   A top Central Bank official acknowledged Tuesday that the bank
has spent nearly dlrs 1 billion in reserves over the past month to
support the ruble, which remained steady at around 6.18 to the
dollar.
	   But Deputy Chairman Sergei Alexashenko said the bank still has
dlrs 14.6 billion in reserves, up a low of dlrs 14 billion last
week, and the bank has not had to intervene in recent days.
	   Investors' panic began last week, triggered by reverberations
from the Asian financial crisis, a wave of workers' strikes, and a
drop in world oil and gas prices. Russia is heavily dependent on
oil and gas exports.
	   The Russian stock market, whose performance was the world's best
last year, has reversed its fortunes and so far is this year's
worst-performing exchange. After climbing 98 percent last year, the
market has slid 55 percent since the beginning of the year.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or other lenders, similar to
those arranged after Asia's financial crisis hit last year.
	   But Russian officials have had trouble meeting the stiff
conditions that accompany such aid. The IMF has held up recent
installments of the loan to try and force Russian compliance with
the terms, which include improved tax collection and limits on
government spending.
	   Moreover, the government doesn't want to worsen the appearance
of crisis, and argues that Russia's underlying economic indicators
remain steady: the economy grew a nominal 0.8 percent last year,
and inflation is in the single digits.
	   As a result, the financial crisis has so far affected only
investors and its effects have not yet reached ordinary Russians.

	   Three people on the ground were killed when the Airbus 320
skidded off the runway, crossed a river and plowed into a row of
shanties before stopping atop a nightclub near a crowded commercial
center in the Philippines city of Bacolod.
	   A preliminary investigation report on the March 22 accident by
the Philippines Air Transportation Office, which has been obtained
by The Associated Press, said that during an attempted landing the
plane's pilot misadjusted the position of two levers controlling
the thrust of his aircraft's two engines.
	   One lever, controlling the left engine, remained on flight mode
while a second lever controlling the right engine was shifted to
``reverse thrust,'' the report said.
	   It was not clear why the pilot shifted only one lever to reverse
while the other remained on ``flight mode.''
	   A computer controlling the engines sensed the mismatch and
interpreted that the right engine had malfunctioned and provided
additional power to it, the report said.
	   The mismatch in thrust caused the plane to veer rightward. The
pilot tried to brake the plane but failed as he was also trying to
keep the aircraft on the runway, the report said.
	   The faulty lever positions were ascertained by investigators
from the plane's flight data recorder. They were not able to
question the plane's flight crew because they remain hospitalized
under sedation, the report said.
	   It said there was no indication that the accident was caused by
weather conditions or problems with navigational or communications
equipment.
	   Air transportation chief Carlos Tanega said in March that the
pilot missed the normal touchdown zone and landed ``beyond the
first half'' of the runway.
	   Airbus Industrie declined to comment on the investigation
report.
	   ``Until a public report is published, we have no comment on this
accident or any other accident,'' said Sean Lee, a Singapore-based
spokesman for Airbus.
	   Philippines Airlines did not return repeated telephone requests
for comment.
	   PAL, the country's national carrier, is experiencing severe
financial difficulties due in part to the Asian currency crisis.
	   The Airbus 320 was one of four delivered to PAL last year. The
airline has ordered 12 of the aircraft as part of a modernization
program that began in 1996.
	   The accident followed the crash on Feb. 2 of a Cebu Pacific Air
DC-9 jet which flew into a mountain as it prepared to land in the
southern Philippine city of Cagayan de Oro, killing all 104 people
aboard.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid organizations struggled to
deliver emergency supplies and treat injured survivors of an
earthquake in a remote region of northern Afghanistan that killed
at least 3,000 people and left thousands more homeless.
	   Landslides cut off roads to the hardest-hit areas, where 16
villages were destroyed, blocking aid trucks, Martin Griffiths,
U.N. deputy emergency relief coordinator, said Monday in New York.
	   ``This is a scenario from hell,'' Griffiths said. ``It's a
region which is extremely inaccessible.''
	   As aftershocks rumbled through the region Monday, frightened
residents scrambled out of the few homes still standing and refused
to go back inside.
	   The quake, which hit Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of
6.9, flattened entire villages, cracked mountains and unleashed
landslides across this rugged, remote region of struggling farmers.
Estimates of the dead ranged from 3,000 to 5,000.
	   Thousands more were missing or homeless. About 45,000 of the
area's 70,000 people have no shelter, Griffiths said.
	   The quake sent houses tumbling down mountainsides into the
valleys below. Up to 80 villages were estimated to be heavily
damaged, and another dozen obliterated.
	   In Chaujan, a village near the quake's epicenter, the scene was
horrific. Thousands of homes were gone. People wandered, dazed,
through the rubble.
	   In the middle of the devastation, a lone wooden door stood
erect, clumps of mud on it the only reminder of the home that once
stood. The family of four who lived there was dead.
	   Tending to the injured was a priority Monday. The International
Red Cross and the United Nations set up mobile medical units in
Shari Basurkh, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Faisabad, the capital
of northern Badakhshan province.
	   Doctors Without Borders were operating a clinic there.
Helicopters ferried the wounded, many of them with broken bones,
most of them small children and the elderly.
	   Aid workers distributed blankets, tents and plastic sheeting.
	   Germany will give 500,000 marks (dlrs 278,000) to support relief
efforts by the Red Cross and other relief organizations, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel announced Tuesday.

Three executed in Beijing for rape, murder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have executed three men
convicted of crimes including rape, murder and drug trafficking,
the state-run Beijing Evening News reported Tuesday.
	   The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court recently sentenced Li
Liansheng, a 48-year-old farmer from nearby Hebei province, to
death for raping a woman and drowning her in a ditch when she
resisted him, the report said.
	   Wang Qingfei, a 33-year-old hospital worker from Beijing, was
sentenced to death for shooting a man to death during an argument
and for peddling heroin.
	   The third man, He Haiming, was convicted of rape, armed robbery,
murder and assault, it said.
	   The three were executed recently, the report said without
providing a specific date.

Greenpeace activists arrested following oil rig protest 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Six Greenpeace activists were arrested
Tuesday and their ship ordered seized off Norway's western coast
after attempting a protest action against an offshore oil rig.
	   On Monday, another Greenpeace activist, 29-year-old Jacob
Hartmann of Denmark, was arrested after chaining himself to the
same drilling rig.
	   Greenpeace claims there are already more known reserves of
fossil fuels than can be burned without accelerating global
warming, so it is pointless to search for more. The group also
staged a brief protest Tuesday outside Shell's Norwegian offices in
the town of Stavanger.
	   The protesters and their ship, the Stahlratte, as well as a
Norwegian coast guard vessel, were about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
off the western Norway port of Kristiansund. The rig is drilling an
exploratory well there for the Norwegian division of the Shell Oil
Company.
	   Police Chief Kjell Otto Lilleberg said six activists in rubber
boats attempted to reach the rig on Tuesday, and were arrested for
breaching the 500-meter (yard) security zone around all offshore
oil rigs.
	   ``I ordered their arrest and the seizure of their vessel, the
Stahlratte, which is to be brought to Kristiansund for a police
investigation,'' Lilleberg said by telephone.

Thai army opposes sending rice to feed Khmer Rouge defectors 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai army opposes granting a
request from Cambodia to supply 1,000 tons of rice to Khmer Rouge
defectors at a former guerrilla stronghold just across the border,
a senior Thai officer said Tuesday.
	   The Cambodian army has asked to buy the rice from Thailand to
distribute to some 10,000 Khmer Rouge fighters and their families
who defected to the Cambodian government in recent months from the
base, Anlong Veng.
	   The Thai officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Chong Sa-Ngam Pass, where the rice would need to cross, is not an
official checkpoint and could not accommodate such a shipment.
	   The area has been the scene of occasional fighting between
Cambodian troops and Khmer Rouge remnants and security could not be
guaranteed, the officer said. It is also heavily mined.
	   The officer said the rice would be permitted through other
checkpoints, but they lie so far from the refugee concentrations
inside Cambodia that such shipments would be impractical.
	   Thailand may fear that supplying the defectors with rice could
offend some 20,000 refugees who came from Anlong Veng to Thailand
in recent weeks. They include disarmed rebels opposed to the
government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh and the families
of die-hards still fighting in Cambodia.
	   Officials in Phnom Penh have frequently accused the Thais of
aiding the Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of as many as 2
million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.
	   Thailand has denied that it is sheltering wanted Khmer Rouge
leaders and says it has a policy of helping people fleeing
fighting. Khmer Rouge fighters who seek shelter in Thailand are
required to lay down their arms at the border.

Ice jam causes flood on Russian Arctic river 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A jam of ice floes has blocked a river in Russia's
Arctic region, causing it to overflow and flood two villages, a
news report said Tuesday.
	   Thirty families have been evacuated in the villages on
Laborozhskoye and Velikovisochnoye near the Pechora River, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   No casualties were reported, but 95 out of the villages' 120
houses have been flooded, with water reaching first-floor windows,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Demolition experts from the city of St. Petersburg were working
to break up the ice jam by dropping explosives onto the ice from a
plane, the report said.

U.S. agrees to sell navigation, targeting equipment: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The United States is willing to sell
Taiwan advanced night navigation and targeting equipment to enhance
the capabilities of its U.S.-built F-16 fighters, a local media
report said Tuesday.
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the U.S. Defense
Department was prepared to sell Taiwan 28 Pathfinder/Sharpshooter
infrared devices, along with training and support, for U.S. dlrs
160 million.
	   Taiwan's Defense Ministry would not confirm the sale, but
spokesman Kung Fan-ding said the military ``looked forward,'' to
such purchases.
	   Taiwan has been worried about heavy pressure on Washington from
China not to sell Taiwan more weapons. China claims Taiwan as a
breakaway province which is subject to forcible reintegration, if
necessary.
	   Taiwan bought 120 single-seat F-16As and 30 twin-seater F-16Bs
from the United States in 1992 for U.S. dlrs 6 billion. Eighty of
the planes have arrived so far.
	   The new devices would vastly increase night flight safety,
especially at low altitudes, CNA said.
	   Taiwan lost an F-16B and two pilots over the Taiwan Strait
during a training flight in March. The plane has not been found,
and no cause of the accident has been announced.
	   Taiwan has virtually remade its air defenses through the
purchase of the F-16s, 60 French Mirage 2000-5 fighters, and
continuous deployment of 130 homemade IDF jets.
	   The upgrade has allowed it to retire planes such as 1950s-era
F-104 Starfighters to meet the challenge from China's Su-27 jets
purchased from Russia.

Some 44 countries demand India, Pakistan end tests, join treaties 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Forty-six countries joined Tuesday in demanding
that India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and
join in the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' said the joint statement.
	   The tests ``blatantly undermine'' attempts to halt nuclear
proliferation and threaten to undermine efforts to eliminate
nuclear weapons, said the statement.
	   Among the countries that backed the statement before an
emergency meeting of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament were
declared nuclear powers Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States.
	   The statement, read by Clive Pearson, New Zealand's ambassador
to the conference, said India's and Pakistan's explosions in May
were ``provocative and dangerous acts.''
	   ``Indulging in competitive maneuvers ... belongs to a bygone
age,'' said Pearson. ``Tensions will only be resolved permanently
through constructive dialogue and negotiation.''
	   He said, ``It is now crucial that India and Pakistan announce
immediately a cessation to all further testing of these weapons,
renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and ratify
unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.

Driver confesses in Gucci slaying, says real killer still at large

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The man who drove the getaway car in the
slaying of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci confessed Tuesday, but said
the real killer is still at large.
	   In dramatic courtroom testimony, Orazio Cicala said he was drawn
into the murder plot by Gucci's ex-wife, a high-society psychic and
a hotel doorman.
	   Then he dropped a bombshell by saying the accused triggerman is
innocent and the real gunman is still at large.
	   Cicala described the killer as a ``dolt'' he'd met when he was
dealing drugs, but said he was afraid to reveal his identity, the
ANSA news agency reported. ``I can't give you his name because I
have children and a family,'' he told the court.
	   For the first time, all five defendants appeared at the trial:
Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, her longtime
confident and spiritual adviser Giuseppina Auriemma, Milan hotel
doorman Ivano Savioni and alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo.
	   Gucci was shot dead March 27, 1995, as he walked into his office
building in downtown Milan. When his ex-wife was arrested in
January 1997, prosecutors alleged she had Gucci murdered because
he'd halved her alimony to dlrs 900,000 a year.
	   Reggiani Martinelli's lawyers said in opening arguments that she
hated Gucci and often said she'd like to see him dead. But they
said a 1992 brain tumor operation had rendered incapable of
conceiving and carrying out the murder scheme.
	   They called it ``a psychological short-circuit'' that destroyed
her ``capacity for rational judgment.''

U.N. refugee agency chief visits Sierra Leone 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The head of the United Nations
refugee agency began talks Tuesday in Sierra Leone on repatriating
half-a-million refugees to this battle-scarred West African
country.
	   UNHCR director Soren Jessen-Petersen flew into Sierra Leone's
capital of Freetown late Monday for meetings with President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah and other government officials before leaving on
Wednesday.
	   Discussions were to focus on the problem of repatriating some
530,000 Sierra Leoneans who have fled the country since 1991, UNHCR
officials said.
	   Most of the refugees have sought refuge in neighboring Guinea,
Liberia and the Gambia.
	   A 1991-96 rebel war in Sierra Leone triggered an exodus of some
380,000 refugees from the country. A further 150,000 are believed
to have fled since May last year when Kabbah's government was
ousted by troops loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma.
	   After spending months in exile, Kabbah was restored to power by
a Nigerian-led West African intervention force in March.

Report: India had plans for sixth nuclear test With US-Pakistan-India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India pulled back at the last minute
from carrying out a sixth nuclear test, Jane's Defense Weekly said
in its new issue to be released Wednesday.
	   The London-based weekly, quoting unnamed defense sources, said
that though two other small devices were tested May 13, the third
test was abandoned that day partly due to a minor technical hitch _
but largely for political reasons. The government was apparently
hesitant after being hit with U.S. sanctions as punishment for
three tests on May 11.
	   ``The unexploded device has reportedly been recovered from the
site and put into `safekeeping','' Jane's said in an advance copy
of its report made available Tuesday.
	   India has declared a moratorium on further testing, and called
for international talks on a nuclear freeze.
	   Also Tuesday, the country's Atomic Energy Commission Chairman R.
Chidambaram denied a local news agency report that he told fellow
scientists Monday at a Bombay forum that small tests might be
carried out for research purposes. He said there was absolutely no
possibility of further testing.
	   The five Indian tests provoked Pakistan to carry out six
explosions and raised tensions between the two neighbors and
longtime rivals.

13 die, 590 sickened by dengue fever in Manila 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Thirteen people have died and 590
others were hospitalized with dengue fever in Manila between
January and May, prompting a campaign against the disease, a
Philippines health official said Tuesday.
	   Dr. Jesus Abella said officials are urging residents to empty
stagnant water from old tires, flower pots and even the holy water
receptacles in Catholic churches to reduce breeding places for
dengue-carrying mosquitoes.
	   Abella, chief of the Department of Health's Communicable Disease
Control Service, said dengue fever outbreaks are common at the
start of the country's monsoon season, which began recently.
	   He said many Filipinos purchased large water containers to stock
water during a long drought caused by the El Nido weather
phenomenon, and mosquitoes are now breeding in those tanks.
	   Even the holy water fonts in churches are potential breeding
places, he said.
	   ``We have found a water font with larvae,'' he added.
	   Dengue fever, which is carried by mosquitoes which bite in the
daytime, causes a high fever, rashes, nose bleeds, and in severe
cases, shock and internal bleeding. The disease can be fatal if not
treated early. A vaccine has not been developed.
	   Other dengue cases have been reported outside Manila, but
complete statistics have not been gathered by the health office.
	   Further south, health officials have discovered 39 people
infected with another mosquito-borne disease, disfiguring
filariasis.
	   Dr. Leda Hernandez, another health official, said the disease
was discovered after routine blood tests of residents of four
hinterland villages in Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental province.
	   Hernandez said filariasis is caused by repeated bites from
infected mosquitoes and remains unnoticed for at least 1O years.
	   The mosquitoes lay eggs with parasites which attack lymph nodes,
disabling their victims by causing gross swelling of the limbs.
	   Filariasis is endemic in many remote areas in the Philippines.
It is usually non-lethal but leaves victims disfigured.

Large Swedish, Finnish forestry products groups mull merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Swedish forestry products group
Stora AB confirmed Tuesday it is in merger talks with the Finnish
forestry products company Enso Oyj.
	   ``The boards of Stora and the Finnish Enso Group are meeting
(Tuesday) to discuss a possible merger,'' Stora commented in a
brief statement.
	   Trading of Stora's shares on the Swedish Stock Exchange were
suspended, the company said. Trading of Enso on the Helsinki
Exchange also was halted.
	   From Helsinki, the government's minister of trade and industry,
Antti Kalliomaki, said, ``The government, as (part) owner (of
Enso), has been engaged in discussions for a long time, and this
(proposed merger) has been one alternative, but no decisions have
been made.''
	   Each company has about 20,ooo employees.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Forty-six countries joined Tuesday in demanding
that India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and
join in the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' said the joint statement.
	   The tests ``blatantly undermine'' attempts to halt nuclear
proliferation and threaten to undermine efforts to eliminate
nuclear weapons, said the statement.
	   Among the countries that backed the statement before an
emergency meeting of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament were
declared nuclear powers Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States.
	   The statement, read by Clive Pearson, New Zealand's ambassador
to the conference, said India's and Pakistan's explosions in May
were ``provocative and dangerous acts.''
	   ``Indulging in competitive maneuvers ... belongs to a bygone
age,'' said Pearson. ``Tensions will only be resolved permanently
through constructive dialogue and negotiation.''
	   He said, ``It is now crucial that India and Pakistan announce
immediately a cessation to all further testing of these weapons,
renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and ratify
unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.

Air France chief wants truce with pilots over strike disrupting World Cup training.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France moved into the second day of a strike
Tuesday, and the company president, due to hold talks later in the
day with aggrieved pilots, called for a truce to allow the World
Cup to go ahead smoothly.
	   Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta agreed Monday to meet
representatives of pilots' unions to discuss ending the strike
which otherwise could continue for at least two weeks, disrupting
the June 10-July 12 soccer tournament.
	   The meeting, the first since last-ditch talks broke down
Thursday, was scheduled for 3:30 p.m (1330 GMT).
	   In an interview published Tuesday with the newspaper Le
Parisien, Spinetta said ``there was still a lot of work to do'' to
reach an agreement with the pilots, and suggested postponing talks
until after the World Cup.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike.
	   The strike caused chaos for almost 100,000 passengers Monday,
worries for fans and teams attending the month-long World Cup
starting June 10 and embarrassment for all.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to report Tuesday
to resume training.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest against 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay
cuts. Most of the 3,200 Air France pilots did not work Monday.
	   Departure screens at airports around the nation flashed the bad
news: ``annule'' and ``canceled'' next to list upon list of
flights. Air France planes, many decorated with giant paintings of
soccer players representing the 32 competing teams, sat idle.
	   Air France said there would be a slight improvement in traffic
Tuesday, with 16-18 percent of long-haul flights taking off,
compared to 10 percent Monday, and 32 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights scheduled.
	   In total, 44 more flights were scheduled Tuesday, compared to
Monday.
	   Air France, the World Cup's official carrier, is committed to
transporting teams to the 10 competition sites around France. The
company has said if the strike continues it will probably use
outside carriers to meet its obligations.
	   Air France, which almost went bankrupt in 1993, has given no
indication it is ready to withdraw a controversial plan to cut
pilots' salaries in exchange for shares in Air France.
	   Pilots also want Air France to do away with salary cuts for
starting pilots, a system in force for the past year.
	   The strike has left passengers stranded across France at the end
of a long holiday weekend. Lyon and Marseille, France's second and
third-largest cities and World Cup venues, were particularly hit,
as was Paris.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is sending the U.S. team on an American Airlines flight to Paris
that connects to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses for all their travel plans in France.

Gascoigne admits he was drunk the night before he was cut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne says he was drunk the night before
he was cut from the England World Cup team.
	   Gascoigne, the 31-year-old midfielder who was dropped Sunday by
coach Glenn Hoddle for a lack of fitness, spoke about the incident
in a front-page story in Tuesday's tabloid Sun newspaper.
	   ``Yes, I was drunk. I'd not had a drink in nine days,'' he said
in the interview, his first since being unexpectedly cut while
training in Spain.
	   Gascoigne, who has been criticized for his reported
hard-drinking and smoking 20 cigarettes a day, said he left the bar
in La Manga, Spain, had sandwiches in his room with teammate David
Seaman, and then ``crashed out.''
	   Gascoigne also said he had been drinking beer during a Sunday
golf game just hours before he met with Hoddle.
	   Given the bad news, the star of England's 1990 World Cup team
admitted he exploded.
	   ``He looked at me and said, `Paul, I'm sorry but you're not
coming to France. You're not fit enough'.''
	   ``I completely lost it. I went mad, berserk. I lost my rag big
time. I was shouting and swearing. I couldn't believe the injustice
of it.
	   ``I was swearing, Everything came out. I let go of all the
emotion building up inside me. I was so hurt.
	   ``I admit I kicked the door, kicked the furniture. I let my
frustration go.''
	   ``I was crying and out of control. I didn't want to talk to
anybody and I didn't want to listen to what Glenn had to say. There
is nothing he could say.''
	   Gascoigne, ranked as one of England's best midfielders, has made
more headlines recently for his play off the soccer field. In a
highly publicized incident, he admitted beating his estranged wife
Sheryl and late apologized for it.
	   He's also been panned by British newspapers for his widely
reported late-night capers with show business friends.

Accused Russian swindler turns up in religious pilgrimage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ First he disappeared, and police in the Russian
Far East spent a week looking for the head of a collapsed pyramid
scheme, in which more than 55,000 people lost their savings.
	   But Igor Chernozatonsky didn't turn up dead or on the lam.
Instead, he was spotted marching with a group of Russian Orthodox
pilgrims walking some 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) across the
country to mark the 2000th anniversary of Christianity.
	   Chernozatonsky said the Virgin Mary has come to him in a dream
and told him to walk from his home town of Vladivostok to Moscow to
atone for his sins and ``save'' investors who lost their money in
his crashed scheme, news reports said Tuesday.
	   ``This is like God's punishment for my mistakes,''
Chernozatonsky was quoted as saying by the daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``And I have decided to bear it from the beginning to the
end.''
	   ``With God's help, I'll be solving (investors') problems on the
way,'' the daily Moscow Times quoted him as saying.
	   Pyramid schemes are nothing new in Russia, where hundreds have
sprung up since the 1991 Soviet collapse. The most infamous one,
MMM, stripped millions of Russians of their savings.
	   Investors who lost money in Chernozatonsky's Primorye Charitable
Food Fund were skeptical about his atonement.
	   ``This is another trick to avoid punishment,'' Larisa Pinchuk, a
television producer who lost more than dlrs 6,500 in the scheme,
was quoted as saying by the Moscow Times.
	   Chernozatonsky ``probably counted on a lot of elderly people,
who are deeply religious, to forgive him,'' said Galina Medvedeva,
an activist with a committee to protect investors.
	   The pilgrimage plans to arrive in Moscow by Russian Orthodox
Christmas on Jan. 7, 2000. Chernozatonsky was still marching
Tuesday, having passed the city of Ussuriisk, some 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Vladivostok, the Moscow Times said.

Thai stocks close higher; official says inflation will fall 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with stock closing prices, 2nd graf
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stocks rose Tuesday after five
straight days of losses, while a deputy prime minister tried to
curb bad inflation news by predicting price increases would slow in
the second half of the year.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 0.60 points to
313.64, which dealers attributed to selective buying of banking and
finance company stocks that had fallen in recent days.
	   The Thai currency earlier weakened to 42.25 to the U.S. dollar,
tumbling from 41.55 Monday on fears of a deeper recession. It was
the lowest level plumbed by the baht in 11 weeks.
	   Supachai Patichpakdi, who is also commerce minister, said in an
interview late Monday on the ITV television station that declining
inflation would allow high interest rates to fall as well.
	   ``That will benefit the entire economic system,'' Supachai said,
without projecting any estimated figures.
	   High interest rates are crippling Thai businesses struggling to
survive the current recession, which the government said last week
will be far deeper and probably longer than previously expected.
	   The International Monetary Fund has demanded that Thailand keep
inflation at an average of 10.5 percent for the year as a condition
of receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package.
	   The economy has begun to stabilize under the administration of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but new declines in the currency and
stock market this week on fears of a deeper recession underscored
how far the country still has to go.
	   The Commerce Ministry released data Monday that showed Thai
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, the worst
inflation in more than three years. It was the fifth consecutive
month this year that the index has kept rising.
	   Inflation has worsened steadily since July 1997, when Thailand
abandoned its fixed-exchange rate system under attacks by currency
speculators and triggered a chain reaction of crises across Asia.

EDS: UPDATES with closing figures from all markets
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,
but share prices rebounded in Tokyo on news that Travelers Group
Inc. was acquiring a stake in Nikko Securities Co., the
third-largest Japanese brokerage house.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 233.42 points, or
1.52 percent, to close at 15,554.45. On Monday, pessimism about the
economy drove the benchmark index down 349.75 points, or 2.23
percent.
	   Nikko Securities Co. was among the day's biggest gainers, ending
up almost 8 percent. New York-based Travelers Group, the world's
largest financial company, announced Monday that it was taking a 25
percent stake in the Japanese brokerage, which had been struggling.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the yen as concern about
Japan's economy continued to undercut the Japanese currency.
	   The dollar was quoted at 139.25 yen, up 0.13 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo. In New York overnight, the dollar settled at
139.70 yen, its highest level since June 24, 1991.
	   Shares on the Seoul Stock Exchange tumbled as investors feared
that a weaking of the Japanese currency could hurt South Korea
exports.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 12.6 points, or 3.7
percent, to 324.10.
	   Indonesian shares slumped across the board amid continued
concern over the country's uncertain political and economic
situation.
	   Dealers said investors dumped shares of companies connected to
former president Suharto after the country's attorney general said
that these companies will be investigated.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite index fell 14.480 points,
or 3.5 percent, to 399.599.
	   Dealers said the weakening of the Indonesian currency also hurt
the market. The rupiah was trading at 11,775 to the dollar, down
from its close Monday at 11,550 rupiah.
	   Philippine shares plunged on fears of a possible economic
recession sweeping the region.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 49.97 points,
or 2.5 percent, to 1,946.08. It was the index's lowest closing
level since Jan. 29, when it registered 1,796.68.
	   Singapore shares also slumped, with the Straits Times
Industrials Index plunging 2.2 percent, or 27.47 points, to close
at a four-and-a-half month low of 1,207.12.
	   Traders were not happy with Singapore's Finance Minister Richard
Hu's message to Parliament on Monday, in which he rejected any
immediate government pump-priming, or measures to ease the hard hit
property development industry.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally lower as investors
remained concerned over the territory's economic downturn.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 13.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at
8,598.17. On Monday, the index had tumbled 322.55 points.
	   The index, which has been on an extended losing streak since
getting the word last week that the economy was heading toward
recession, shed 156 points by midday.
	   It regained most of its losses on selective bargain-hunting late
in the session.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower in volatile trading. The
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 40.61 points, or 0.53
percent, to 7,565.64.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 7.85 points. or 0.3 percent, to 2,173.98.
	   SYDNEY: The Australian share market's main index posted its
lowest close since March 6, pressured by an ailing gold sector. The
All Ordinaries Index closed at 2671.1, down 18 points. or 0.6
percent.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed slightly higher. The
benchmark Composite Index rose 2.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to
520.61.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly higher after five
consecutive sessions of losses. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index edged up 0.60 points to 313.64.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,
but share prices rebounded in Tokyo on news that Travelers Group
Inc. was acquiring a stake in Nikko Securities Co., the
third-largest Japanese brokerage house. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average gained 233.42 points, or 1.52 percent, to close at
15,554.45. Nikko Securities Co. was among the day's biggest
gainers, ending up almost 8 percent. New York-based Travelers
Group, the world's largest financial company, announced Monday that
it was taking a 25 percent stake in the Japanese brokerage, which
had been struggling. In Hong Kong, share prices closed generally
lower as investors remained concerned over the territory's economic
downturn. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator
of blue chips, fell 13.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at
8,598.17. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian financial planners maintained
Tuesday that anti-nuclear sanctions will have only a limited effect
on a nation struggling to climb out of an economic valley. The
United States, Australia, Japan and other countries have cut off
loans and all but humanitarian aid to punish India for setting off
five nuclear tests last month. Indian Finance Secretary Montek
Singh Ahluwalia, quoted by Dow Jones Newswires, said it appeared
state-owned Indian corporations can still borrow from U.S. banks.
Only direct investment to the government in the form of treasury
bills and government bonds is affected, he said. (INDIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Kia Motors Corp. workers walked off
their jobs for the second straight day Tuesday as the government
prepared to sell the bankrupt firm at auction. Ford Motor Co. of
the United States was among several takeover candidates. Kia's
20,000 unionized workers went on strike Monday, demanding that the
company pay overdue wages and guarantee job security after the
bidding. Kia workers have been paid only half of their wages since
last July. Kia Motors, once the nation's second largest car firm,
is under court receivership after going bankrupt last July under
the weight of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans. Industry Minister Park
Tae-young said in a published interview Tuesday that creditors of
Kia will announce a bidding schedule for the troubled carmaker
later this month. (SKOREA-KIA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's flagship airline has
deferred taking delivery of three Boeing airplanes for three to
four years, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday. Stung by huge loses
following the crash of the Malaysian currency and the drop in
passenger traffic because of the larger Asian economic crisis, the
Malaysian Airline System announced a loss of 259.8 million rinngit
(dlrs 66.6 million) in the year ended March. The three Boeing
747-400s may not be taken from the Seattle-based manufacturer until
2002, said the spokeswoman. During the last year, the company
bought 10 Boeing aircraft of various sizes. Expecting a further
decline of overall traffic, the company said over the weekend it
would review capacity requirements. It has already suspended
services to several European and Asian destinations.
(MALAYSIA-BOEING ORDER)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's state-run railways will be reorganized
and downsized to help reduce costs and trim losses that have
climbed to 16 billion yuan (dlrs 1.9 billion) over the past four
years, the Chinese railways minister said Tuesday. Railways are
among many unprofitable state-owned industries that are shedding
workers in broad reforms intended to make China's economy more
competitive. Like many other businesses, the railways are also
hoping to enlist more foreign investment and technology for what
China estimates to amount to a dlrs 350 billion market, including
upgrading of rail lines and purchases of locomotives and other
equipment. Railways Minister Fu Zhihuan said that non-transport
businesses would be spun off into separate enterprise groups,
allowing the railways to focus on their core operations.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid organizations struggled to
deliver emergency supplies and treat injured survivors of an
earthquake in a remote region of northern Afghanistan that killed
at least 3,000 people and left thousands more homeless. Landslides
cut off roads to the hardest-hit areas, where 16 villages were
destroyed, blocking aid trucks, Martin Griffiths, U.N. deputy
emergency relief coordinator, said Monday in New York. ``This is a
scenario from hell,'' Griffiths said. ``It's a region which is
extremely inaccessible.'' As aftershocks rumbled through the region
Monday, frightened residents scrambled out of the few homes still
standing and refused to go back inside. The quake, which hit
Saturday with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, flattened entire
villages, cracked mountains and unleashed landslides across this
rugged, remote region of struggling farmers. Estimates of the dead
ranged from 3,000 to 5,000. (AFGHANISTAN-QUAKE)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister praised
Pakistan for its nuclear tests _ offering some solace amid
near-worldwide disapproval. Kamal Kharrazi _ the first official to
Islamic Pakistan since it exploded six nuclear devices _ said
Monday that Muslims worldwide welcomed the nuclear tests. It is
particularly so in the Middle East, where Muslims believe their
traditional adversary, Israel, possesses the ability to make
nuclear bombs, he said. ``Until now, they felt in ... the Middle
East that only Israel had the capability ... now they feel
confident,'' because a fellow-Islamic country also possesses the
ability to make nuclear weapons, Kharrazi told reporters at a brief
news conference upon his arrival in the Pakistani capital
Islamabad. Kharrazi, however, dismissed suggestions that Iran was
preparing to follow Pakistan down the nuclear road. ``We don't have
any nuclear weapons program ... what we have is for peaceful
purposes,'' and all Iran's nuclear facilities are open to
international inspectors, he said. (PAKISTAN-IRAN-NUCLEAR)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Keeping up the pace of reform, the
Indonesian government Tuesday formally recognized the country's
largest independent labor union, which had been suppressed under
ex-President Suharto. Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris told reporters
the Indonesian Welfare Labor Union could now operate as a legal
organization. The union is headed by dissident Muchtar Pakpahan,
one of four political prisoners released by the government in
recent days. ``According to the labor laws, it meets all criteria
to exist,'' the minister said after talks with President B.J.
Habibie. Habibie, formally Suharto's deputy, replaced the
76-year-old autocrat on May 21 after the nation of 202 million
people was rocked by rioting and protests, sparked by the worst
economic crisis in 30 years. (INDONESIA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin denounced his staff
Tuesday for failing to fulfill one of government's key tasks:
collecting taxes. ``The tax situation has not improved, only
worsened, especially in recent months,'' a gruff-sounding Yeltsin
told law enforcement officials in a Kremlin meeting broadcast on
national television. Russia's pitiful tax collection system is at
the heart of the country's current financial crisis, which worsened
Monday when the stock market dropped another 10 percent.
Altogether, the market has fallen 44 percent in the past month.
However, the market rebounded slightly by midday Tuesday, and was
up 4 percent from Monday's close. Trying to halt the slide in
Russia's financial markets, Yeltsin summoned government and
business leaders to confer with him Tuesday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France moved into the second day of a strike
Tuesday, and the company president, due to hold talks later in the
day with aggrieved pilots, called for a truce to allow the World
Cup to go ahead smoothly. Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta
agreed Monday to meet representatives of pilots' unions to discuss
ending the strike which otherwise could continue for at least two
weeks, disrupting the June 10-July 12 soccer tournament. The
meeting, the first since last-ditch talks broke down Thursday, was
scheduled for 3:30 p.m (1330 GMT). In an interview published
Tuesday with the newspaper Le Parisien, Spinetta said ``there was
still a lot of work to do'' to reach an agreement with the pilots,
and suggested postponing talks until after the World Cup. (AIR

China says no again to Tiananmen investigation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite renewed pleas from dissidents and
relatives of people killed in the military assault on Tiananmen
Square demonstrators, China on Tuesday ruled out any investigation
into the crackdown.
	   With the ninth anniversary of the armed quelling coming up on
Thursday, Chinese police have grown edgy about challenges to
Communist Party rule. At least 20 dissidents have been detained
nationwide to prevent public commemorations, by one monitoring
group's count.
	   Sporadic labor unrest and resentment among millions of laid-off
urban workers nationwide has increased the volatility of what
Beijing residents call the ``sensitive'' anniversary season.
	   In central Xi'an city, 200 workers from a nearly bankrupt state
construction firm staged a sit-in at a busy intersection Tuesday to
protest layoffs, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Plainclothes police watched Tiananmen Square in central Beijing
in greater numbers Tuesday, despite a constant drizzle. Uniformed
officers led away a man wearing a placard on his back decrying a
housing dispute.
	   After student-led demonstrators occupied the square for six
weeks, military units fought their way into Beijing on June 4,
1989. Hundreds if not thousands were killed. Thousands more were
arrested in the ensuing nationwide crackdown. Chinese leaders
branded the movement an anti-government rebellion to justify the
attack and have never provided an accounting of the dead.
	   In the past week, groups of dissidents and 28 families of people
killed in the crackdown have urged the government to investigate
the military assault and divulge the death toll.
	   Asked whether the government might agree to a reassessment,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday that Chinese
leaders already had reached the correct conclusion about the
``political disturbances'' and there was no need for a review.
	   Amnesty International said Tuesday at least 250 people remain in
jail from the crackdown. The London-based group called on the
government to release all political prisoners, not just
high-profile dissidents.
	   A democracy campaigner and restaurant owner has been in prison
since 1989 for providing free food to the demonstrators. The Hong
Kong-based Information Center reported Tuesday that Chen Wei's
family was appealing for his release on humanitarian grounds.
	   Chen is serving a 12-year sentence for ``counter-revolutionary
propaganda and incitement.'' He has never seen his daughter, born a
half year after his arrest, and his wife, tired of raising the
child alone, divorced Chen three years ago and returned to her
parent's home, the group said.

Cambodian leader says end of Khmer Rouge helps elections registering to vote. 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen says that
upcoming elections will be more peaceful than polls in 1993
monitored by the United Nations, thanks largely to the collapse of
the Khmer Rouge.
	   In an interview seen Tuesday in his monthly Cambodia New Vision
bulletin, Hun Sen said that security had greatly improved in the
past five years despite tensions that led to a bloody power
struggle with Prince Norodom Ranariddh last year.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh emerged from the 1993 polls as co-prime
ministers, but the prince was driven into exile by a Hun Sen-led
coup last July. Ranariddh came home two months ago to contest
elections called by Hun Sen to win his regime international aid and
legitimacy.
	   Hun Sen was quoted as saying that eligible voters were flocking
to register for the July 26 polls, proving that ``our people prefer
to choose a leadership by ballots rather than bullets.''
	   Critics say that the electoral process has been stacked in favor
of Hun Sen, though intimidation and killings of opposition party
workers appear to have calmed in the last month.
	   Hun Sen said that the atmosphere is far better than five years
ago, when 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers were sent to Cambodia to help
supervise polls that cost dlrs 2 billion to organize and were aimed
at ending decades of civil war.
	   The Khmer Rouge, who caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979, remained a potent
guerrilla force in 1993 and boycotted the polls, threatening to
kill Cambodians who voted.
	   But turnout was massive and the rebel group has gradually
collapsed. Thousands of war-weary guerrillas have made peace since
1996 while die-hards have been pressed into a few hilltop enclaves
near the rugged border with Thailand.
	   ``In 1993, Khmer Rouge occupied many places ...,'' Hun Sen said.
``Those areas have been reintegrated one after another into the
royal government.''
	   Hun Sen said that the government will place 70,000 soldiers and
civilians at the disposal of the National Electoral Commission, the
body overseeing the polls, to ensure a stable election environment.
	   ``There will be no tanks, no armored vehicles, trenches or safe
havens as there were ... in 1993,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen welcomed the arrival of a handful of international
observers, saying their presence helped ``create an atmosphere of
confidence'' in efforts to organize the vote.
	   Meanwhile, opposition figure Sam Rainsy registered to vote in
Kompong Cham province. He joins Ranariddh in running as a candidate
in Kompong Cham, traditionally viewed as a Hun Sen stronghold. The
leader's brother, Hun Neng, is the provincial governor.

Head of Arab League hopes a summit will be held soon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria are working to
hold an Arab summit to discuss the deteriorating situation in the
Middle East, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said
Tuesday.
	   Arab leaders have been discussing convening a summit to produce
a unified stand on stalled Mideast peace talks, but have failed to
agree on how strongly such a meeting would blame Israel for the
stalemate.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he hoped a summit ``will be held soon.... The
contacts which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria are making are in this
respect.''
	   He said the region faces dangers because ``of the halt in the
peace process resulting from Israel's intransigent policy.'' He
spoke from a meeting of Arab officials in Lebanon, and his remarks
were reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March last year when Israel began building a 6,500
housing units for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged Arab leaders to take
a tougher stance toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
whose hard-line policies the Arabs blame for the breakdown in
negotiations.
	   Last week, Arafat said the summit should ``confront Israeli
arrogance.'' He visited Saudi Arabia and Gulf states to convince
their leaders to attend such a gathering. He also met in Cairo with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hassan II of Morocco.
	   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held talks in the past two days with
Syrian President Hafez Assad and Jordan's King Hussein.
	   The last Arab summit, in 1996, warned that Arab nations would
pull back from all ties with Israel unless Netanyahu made good on
pledges in peace pacts with the Palestinians.

Three people injured in Tehran bombing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ At least three people were injured by a
briefcase bomb placed inside a government building in Tehran
Tuesday, police officials said.
	   They said that the bomb at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office
in eastern Tehran exploded at 1:45 p.m. (0915GMT).
	   The condition of the injured, taken by ambulance from the
four-story white marble building, was not known, said the officials
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Iran has been gripped by an intensifying power struggle between
the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami and hard-line
opponents who oppose his social and political reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.
	   The prosecutor's office apprehends and tries Iranians violently
opposed to the revolution, including members of the outlawed
Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   The Iraq-based group, the largest Iranian opposition, is
committed to overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force. It
did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack.

Iran minister to answer for allowing American visits 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-liners in Iran's Parliament, angry at
moderate President Mohammad Khatami's policy of urging visits by
Americans, plan to question the foreign minister about why some
Americans were allowed into the country.
	   On Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported the
right-wingers especially want to ask Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi about a reported visit by media magnate Rupert Murdoch,
who is seen here as an ardent supporter of Israel.
	   ``Why has the foreign ministry granted entry ... to Rupert
Murdoch, one of the main pillars of Zionism,'' said a Majlis
statement carried by the agency.
	   However, there's some question about whether the Australian-born
Murdoch, who is now a U.S. citizen, ever visited.
	   Iran's Farda daily said Murdoch came last week, meeting with
Iranian officials and Iran's football federation and touring
Isfahan. But officials of Murdoch's News Corp. in Sydney and his
Asian television unit in Hong Kong said they had no knowledge of
such a Murdoch visit.
	   Farda also said that a former U.S. official posted to the
Iranian Embassy in Tehran before the 1979 Islamic revolution had
also recently returned to carry out research.
	   Iran does not ban visits by ordinary American citizens, but even
Khatami has said it's too early for official contacts.
	   IRNA did not say when Kharrazi, who is currently in Pakistan, is
expected to appear before the Majlis. The 270-seat house is
dominated by hard-liners opposed to Khatami's political and social
reforms.
	   A U.S. wrestling team and several U.S. academics have visited
Iran since January when Khatami urged cultural and educational
exchanges with the United States.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BATHURST, Australia (AP) _ Former Wallaby scrum half Steve
Merrick described Scotland's rugby team as soft and predicted they
would get smashed by Australia in two tests, after playing the
tourists on Tuesday.
	   Merrick was on the New South Wales Country team beaten 34-13 by
the Scots.
	   Scotland scored four tries and a penalty try while Andrew
Hurdley scored the Country XV's two tries.
	   Graeme Burns, Rowen Shepherd, Gregor Townsend and Gordon
McIlwham crossed for the Scots, who have won two of three games on
the eight-match tour since losing the test against Fiji.
	   Despite Tuesday's win, Merrick said Scotland's depleted and
inexperienced team lacked the physical steel of most national teams
and they faced a disaster in the first test in Sydney on June 13.
	   ``I thought they were a bit soft actually,'' Merrick said.
``They're going to get smashed. They clean out very well, but
they're not that hard in the tackles.
	   ``They weren't that hard and in the scrum they didn't push us
around. They would have outweighed us and they had the height on
us.''
	   Following their humiliating 51-26 test loss to Fiji last week
and an unconvincing 42-13 win over Victoria on Saturday, the Scots,
with eight test players controversially staying at home, were
staring at an embarrassing two-test tour of Australia.
	   Merrick was called up for two tests in 1995 against New Zealand
before quitting the international game to concentrate on his truck
driving career.
	   The 29-year-old was called up tonight for his annual match for
Country and said playing the Scots was like a club match compared
to his experience against the All Blacks.
	   ``When we played Wales recently they flogged us. When you got
tackled you knew you were tackled,'' Merrick said. ``We always get
at least one international a year. We come together a couple of
days before and usually we get smashed. Tonight, it wasn't there.
You have a different ball game.''
	   With new combinations in the backrow, the halves and in the
centers, the Scots often faltered when they tried to move the ball
through the backs.
	   Scotland's coach Jim Telfer said he was happy with his team's
effort Tuesday.
	   ``It's better to have tried and failed than not to have tried at
all,'' Telfer said. ``I wouldn't fault them for their effort and
their enterprise.''
	   Scorers:
	   Scotland 34 (Graeme Burns, Rowen Shepherd, Gregor Townsend,
Gordon McIlwham tries, pen try; Derrick Lee 3 goals, 1 penalty
goal) def. NSW Country (Andrew Hurdley 2 tries; Nathan Friis 1 pen
goal).

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed at least 10 people when
they ambushed three vehicles, including a Kampala-bound bus, in
northern Uganda, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said the attack by the Lord's
Resistance Army occured Monday at Dure near Kitgum, 450 kilometers
(280 miles) north of Kampala.
	   The independent daily Monitor said the attack occured at Akworo
in the same area, but both newspapers said dozens of people were
wounded in the attack.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain confirmation of the
reports from the government military spokesman.
	   LRA rebels struck in central Uganda two weeks ago in Lira
district, 125 kilometers (77 kilometers) south of Kitgum.
	   Initially, the Ugandan army said it had the Sudan-based rebels
surrounded. But later, spokesmen admitted the rebel force of
several hundred had managed to break out.
	   Monday's attack on the bus and two small trucks occurred on the
road from Lira to Kitgum.
	   Northerners complain that the government of Yoweri Museveni is
not doing enough to protect them against LRA raiders who often
abduct children.
	   In an address to the nation Monday, Museveni, himself a former
rebel leader, said government forces had killed 150 rebels during
their latest incursion and said continued force _ not negotiation _
was the way to handle the rebellion.
	   ``We can and we shall end (it) by force,'' he said. ``I do not
discourage those who want to persuade these criminals to come out
peacefully and release all their hostages. Our belief is that even
if they agree to come out, it will be because of force.''
	   The LRA has been battling the Ugandan army since 1987, turning
northern Gulu and Kitgum districts into no-go areas where at least
250,000 people have been grouped into so-called ``protected
villages.''

New commander of Swiss guards appointed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II named a colonel in the
Swiss Army on Tuesday to head his elite corps of Vatican guards,
which was shaken last month by a sensational murder-suicide that
claimed the life of the last commandant.
	   The pontiff chose Col. Pius Segmuller, a 46-year-old colonel on
the army general staff, to head the Swiss Guards. He named Lt.
Elmar Mader, an attorney and army veteran, as second-in-command.
	   The previous commander, Alois Estermann, a 43-year-old veteran
of the guard, was slain on May 4 along with his wife by a
disgruntled young guardsman only hours after he was named head of
the tiny papal army. The young guardsman then killed himself.
	   The Vatican had waited seven months before naming Estermann, an
18-year veteran of the Swiss Guards. Departing from tradition, it
chose a commoner from inside the ranks instead of an officer from
outside the 100-member papal force.
	   Estermann's death, the first murder in the Vatican in 150 years,
grabbed headlines around the world. Although the Vatican has said
it has a ``moral certainty'' about what happened, the case is still
officially open.
	   The Vatican said Segmuller is a native of Lucerne with degrees
from the University of Zurich, the Zurich Military Academy and the
General Staff's academy. Mader, who served in the Swiss Army and is
now a lawyer, is from St. Gallen in the eastern part of
Switzerland. Both are members of the majority German-speaking
community.
	   For five centuries, popes have drawn on Swiss Catholic men to
serve in the papal army, protecting the pope and, in modern times,
performing ceremonial duties at the Vatican.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former premier Viktor Chernomyrdin refused to
confirm Tuesday that he will run for a seat in the Russian
parliament to represent an Arctic region rich in natural gas, a
news agency reported.
	   Earlier, the Interfax news agency quoted aides as saying that
the fired prime minister had decided to stand for election in
Yamalo-Nenets, a stronghold of Russia's natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, which he headed before becoming premier.
	   ``Everything will be revealed in its own time,'' was all
Chernomyrdin said when he met with journalists later in the day,
Interfax said.
	   President Boris Yeltsin sacked Chernomyrdin and his entire
Cabinet in March and replaced them with a new, younger team ordered
to move faster on economic reforms.
	   The elections to represent Yamalo-Nenets in Russia's lower house
of parliament are scheduled for Sept. 27.

Head of Arab League hopes a summit will be held soon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria are working to
hold an Arab summit to discuss the deteriorating situation in the
Middle East, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said
Tuesday.
	   Arab leaders have been discussing convening a summit to produce
a unified stand on stalled Mideast peace talks, but have failed to
agree on how strongly such a meeting would blame Israel for the
stalemate.
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March last year when Israel began building a 6,500
housing units for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he hoped a summit ``will be held soon.... The
contacts which Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria are making are in this
respect.''
	   The region faces dangers because ``of the halt in the peace
process resulting from Israel's intransigent policy,'' he spoke
from a meeting of Arab officials in Lebanon, where his remarks were
reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged Arab leaders to take
a tougher stance toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
whose hard-line policies the Arabs blame for the breakdown in
negotiations.
	   Last week, Arafat said the summit should ``confront Israeli
arrogance.'' He visited Saudi Arabia and Gulf states to convince
their leaders to attend such a gathering. He also met in Cairo with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hassan II of Morocco.
	   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held talks in the past two days with
Syrian President Hafez Assad and Jordan's King Hussein.
	   The last Arab summit, in 1996, warned that Arab nations would
pull back from all ties with Israel unless Netanyahu made good on
pledges in peace pacts with the Palestinians.

Indonesia's new government recognizes independent labor union 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS throughout to add new details
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new government pushed
ahead with reform Tuesday, recognizing the legitimacy of a
previously suppressed labor union and promising to observe basic
workers' rights.
	   Meanwhile a new estimate of the wealth of former President
Suharto and his family has added pressure on the government to root
out corruption that flourished under his 32-year rule.
	   Suharto quit on May 21 following riots and protests amid the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Independent economist Christianto Wibisono has estimated the
Suharto family wealth at about dlrs 20 billion, based on the worth
of companies and foundations controlled by them. Other estimates
have ranged up to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Critics claim some of the fortune has been placed abroad and
should be brought back to help bail out the ailing economy, as
prices and unemployment soars, hurting most of Indonesia's 202
million people.
	   Indonesia's attorney general's office launched a broad inquiry
on Monday into corruption, including allegations that Suharto's
family abused its position and power to build huge business
empires.
	   Human rights groups criticized Suharto for suppressing workers'
rights and allowing bosses to pay low wages while maintaining
sweatshop conditions. Only one state-sanctioned labor union was
permitted to operate.
	   Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris told reporters Monday that new
President B.J. Habibie would soon ratify an International Labor
Organization convention on workers rights.
	   The government would also officially recognize the Indonesian
Welfare Labor Union, headed by dissident Muchtar Pakpahan, one of
four political prisoners released by the government in recent days,
he said.
	   Pakpahan's organization claims to be Indonesia's largest
independent labor union, although the exact size of its present
membership is unclear.
	   ``According to the labor laws, it meets all criteria to exist,''
the minister said after talks with Habibie, who has promised
sweeping reforms and elections by 1999.
	   Until his release last week, Pakpahan had been serving a
three-year sentence for allegedly organizing a workers' riot on the
island of Sumatra in 1994. Since his release, other charges of
subversion against him have been dropped.
	   Despite continuing announcements of reform measures, some
students protesters, who played a key role in Suharto's ouster,
remain dissatisfied.
	   About 100 students staged a noisy but peaceful protest outside
Parliament Tuesday calling for immediate elections and the
resignation of Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto's.
	   About 50 protesters also gathered outside the U.S. Embassy for a
second day to criticize tough reform demands being made by the
International Monetary Fund. They also accused the United States of
meddling in Indonesian affairs through its calls for more reforms.
	   The Washington-based IMF is now considering whether to restart a
dlrs 43 billion bailout package for Indonesia. The package was
derailed last month when political turmoil hit the world's fourth
most populous nation.
	   Hundreds of students in Padang on Sumatra and Ujung Pandang on
Sulawesi island continued to occupy government buildings in protest
against local official corruption.
	   In disputed East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop
Carlos Belo demanded the Indonesian army withdraw from the
half-island territory, invaded by Suharto's troops in 1975 and
annexed a year later.
	   Belo said he intended to travel to Jakarta and discuss troop
withdrawals with Habibie and Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie has said he won't change the government's policy on East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony.
	   The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's claim to the
island, which was briefly an independent nation after the
Portuguese pulled out.

Dawson out of test

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ England's chances of upsetting
Australia in Saturday's rugby union test were rocked Tuesday when
captain Matt Dawson was forced to withdraw because of a knee
injury.
	   Scrum half Dawson, who was leading a controversial 37-man squad
with 20 new caps, has pulled out because of a ligament strain.
	   ``The strain means that Matt will be 95 percent fit, but I am
only going to pick players who are 100 percent,'' said England
coach Clive Woodward on Tuesday.
	   Dawson was ruled out after Tuesday's training session and will
be replaced as captain by Saracens skipper Tony Diprose. Scott
Benton was brought into the side for his first test match.
	   Dawson was named captain after Lawrence Dallaglio ruled himself
out of the tour. He was due to win his 12th cap.
	   Benton, 23, was Dawson's understudy against Scotland and Ireland
in this year's Five Nations Championship.
	   England plays one test against Australia, two against New
Zealand and one against South Africa on its southern tour.
	   Many leading stars were left off the touring party, raising the
ire of officials in all three of their destination countries.
	   Australian Rugby Union chairman Dick McGruther called the squad
the worst prepared English outfit to visit Australia since the
First Fleet.
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen has warned his players about
underestimating the inexperienced tourists. Macqueen said he was
concerned with a ``sloppy'' Australian training session on Tuesday.
	   Australia is a 7-1 favorite with a leading Australian bookmaker
while English bookies have them at 16-1.

Iran announces World Cup roster 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran announced on Tuesday a 22-man roster
for its World Cup squad, including the introduction of two rookies
but with few other surprises.
	   The selection, which was reported by the Islamic Republic News
Agency, included newcomer Ali Latifi, a 22 year-old striker, and
midfielder Sattar Hamedani, 24.
	   Both play for local club Bahman, which was trained by Jalal
Talebi, Iran's current coach.
	   Talebi, an Iranian who was hired last month to replace Croatia's
Tomislav Ivic after several poor performances, dropped two veteran
strikers, Alireza Emamifar and Alireza Akbarpour, and put more
emphasis on the defense and midfield.
	   Iran's three Bundesliga players, Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and
Khodadad Azizi, were included in the roster as was top goalkeeper
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh.
	   The team is currently in Croatia and will play a warmup match
against the country's national team Wednesday before leaving for
France.
	   Iran will face Germany, Yugoslavia and the United States in the
first round of the 32-nation World Cup finals.
  Roster  
	   Goalkeepers: Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, Parviz Boroumand, Nima Nakisa.
	   Defenders: Mohammad Khakpour, Javad Zarincheh, Mohammad Ali
Peyrovani, Ali Akbar Ostad Asadi, Mehdi Pashazadeh, Na'eem Saadavi,
Reza Shahroudi, Nader Mohammadkhani.
	   Midfielders: Hamid Reza Estili, Alireza Mansourian, Mehdi
Mahdavikia, Sirous Din-Mohammadi, Sattar Hamedani, Mehrdad
Minavand, Karim Bagheri.
	   Forwards: Behnam Seraj, Ali Latifi, Khodadad Azizi, Ali Daei.

Romario dropped from Brazilian roster; Emerson called in as replacement

EDS: Inserts new grafs 5-8 with Romario quotes.
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Romario, Brazil's hero from the 1994
World Cup and half of the defending champion's ``Ro-Ro'' forward
combination, was dropped from the side Tuesday, less than a day
before the final rosters were to be submitted to FIFA for France
'98.
	   An injury to his right calf muscle, incurred during training two
weeks ago before the team left Brazil, apparently had not healed
sufficiently for Romario to be ready for the tournament.
	   Midfielder Emerson of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen has been
called in to replace Romario, team officials announced
	   Coach Mario Zagallo made a brief announcement at the team's
training headquarters and then turned the press conference to
Romario, who was choked with tears and could not speak.
	   After a few moments, Romario composed himself and told the
assembled mass of reporters that he was informed of the results of
the MRI on Monday.
	   ``Things are happy for some, sadness for others. But now I think
you're all sad as I am. I don't want to mean this is a farewell
from soccer,'' he said.
	   After breaking down again and covering his face with his hands,
Romario said: ``I will now proabably learn how to value other
things.''
	   He cried once more before being led away by Brazilian team press
officer Nelson Borge as reporters broke out in applause.
	   Romario, who was supposed to form the striking combination with
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo, will likely be replaced
in the starting lineup by Edmundo, but Zagallo would not comment on
the matter.
	   Romario trained by himself Saturday while the team was
traveling, and felt the injury to his right calf. An MRI on Sunday
revealed swelling in the muscle, which could take up to a month to
heal, team Dr. Lidio Toledo said Tuesday at the team's French
training headquarters.
	   A first MRI had revealed nothing serious, team officials said.
	   Monday night, Brazil's technical committee, comprised of
Zagallo, technical coordinator Zico and Toledo, met and decided to
drop Romario.
	   The decision to call in Emerson was based on the feeling that
Brazil was sufficiently stocked in forwards, having six that could
play the position, but that it could use help in backing up Dunga
or Cesar Sampaio.
	   Both had been slowed by injuries, but have recovered.
	   Romario was the hero of Brazil's 1994 World Cup title run,
scoring five goals to lead the team.

Tillekeratne, Dharmasena return for second Test; Doull injured

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Shaken by a humiliating first Test
defeat at the hands of New Zealand, Sri Lanka has recalled Hashan
Tillekeratne and Kumar Dharmasena for the second match to prop up
its middle order batting, team officials said Tuesday.
	   The experienced pair who were dropped due to poor form are back
in a 15-man squad after a dismal batting performance that saw Sri
Lanka suffer a 167 run defeat in the first Test which ended Sunday.
The second test begins Wednesday.
	   The final 11 players will be selected later Tuesday for the
Test, the first in the ancient southern port city of Galle. The
third and final game is in Colombo.
	   New Zealand pace bowler Simon Doull has been ruled out of the
game after aggravating a hamstring injury. He is likely to be
replaced by left-arm fast bowler Shayne O'Conner. The rest of the
New Zealand side is expected to remain unchanged.
	   Tillekeratne, who counts 50 Tests, is almost certain to be
included, with all-rounder Ruwan Kalpage dropped after a dismal
performance in the earlier game.
	   Dharmasena's chances depend on whether Sri Lanka opts to
continue with a lone pace bowler, Pramodya Wickremasinghe, in which
case the off-spinner is likely to play in place of youngster
Malinga Bandara, who failed to take a wicket.
	   However, Dharmasena may not get the chance if a second paceman
is played, probably newcomer Ruchira Perera.
	   Relative newcomer Mahela Jayawardena has cemented his one-drop
batting position, with twin 50s in the first Test.
	   Sri Lanka: Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan
Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardena, Aravinda de Silva, Hashan
Tillekeratne, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Muttiah Muralitharan, Niroshan
Bandaratilleke, Pramodya Wickremasinghe, Kumar Dharmasena, Ruchira
Perera, Suresh Perera, Pradeep Hewage, Malinga Bandara.
	   New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Bryan Young, Mathew
Horne, Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris Cairns,
Chris Harris, Shyane O'Connor, Daniel Vettori, Paul Wiseman, Dion
Nash, Mark Priest, Craig Spearman.

Large parts of Kosovo remain sealed off, four police wounded

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid organizations
warned Tuesday of thousands fleeing the upsurge of violence in
restive Kosovo, which has claimed dozens of lives in the past
several days.
	   All communications with western Kosovo, where Serb forces
recently intensified their campaign to wipe out ethnic Albanian
militants, remained cut off Tuesday, so no update on possible new
casualties was available.
	   Serb police said four policemen were wounded Monday, one
seriously, by ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence
of Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Serbs say their forces in western Kosovo are fighting
guerrillas, who are fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
But ethnic Albanians and international aid officials spoke of
shelled villages and civilians fleeing.
	   Some 2,000 people from Kosovo crossed into northern Albania on
Sunday and Monday. Thousands more have been displaced in the
province itself, Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees said in Geneva.
	   Virtually the entire Albanian population of the Kosovo border
villages of Junik and Decane fled under attack, the spokesman said.
The U.N. refugee agency doesn't know where they are but thinks they
must be in surrounding hills.
	   Refugees interviewed in Albania said they fled massive shelling
by Serbian forces. They spoke of some 1,500 massed in the village
of Junik.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the latest bloodshed is the worst since at
least early March, when Serb police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on independence-minded militants and their families.
	   There were no reports on casualties from fighting Tuesday, but
the Serbian pro-government information center reported four
policemen wounded on Monday.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic Albanian human rights council demanded a
humanitarian corridor be opened for western Kosovo, saying the
people there face hunger.
	   Pajazit Nushi, head of the council and a member of ethnic
Albanian negotiating team, said talks with the government scheduled
for Friday could be canceled.
	   ``I think talks cannot continue if the Serbian side does not
withdraw military and police forces from Kosovo and doesn't stop
the state terror against the Albanians,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, six political parties in Kosovo accused Milosevic of
using the Serb-Albanian talks to commit crimes against civilians in
Kosovo.
	   ``Another Bosnia is happening in Kosovo,'' they warned,
demanding NATO deployment in the province.
	   Refugees talking to The Associated Press on the Albanian side of
the border said one 3-year-old had died on the way and that they
had heard of infants inadvertently suffocated by parents who had
covered their mouths and noses to stop them from crying and giving
away their location to Serb forces.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo
population, want independence from Serbia, which rules the province
with a heavy hand.

Air France chief wants truce with pilots over strike

	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France moved into the second day of a strike
Tuesday, and the company president, due to hold talks later in the
day with aggrieved pilots, called for a truce to allow the World
Cup to go ahead smoothly.
	   Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta agreed Monday to meet
representatives of pilots' unions to discuss ending the strike
which otherwise could continue for at least two weeks, disrupting
the June 10-July 12 soccer tournament.
	   The meeting, the first since last-ditch talks broke down
Thursday, was scheduled for 3:30 p.m (1330 GMT).
	   In an interview published Tuesday with the newspaper Le
Parisien, Spinetta said ``there was still a lot of work to do'' to
reach an agreement with the pilots, and suggested postponing talks
until after the World Cup.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike.
	   The strike caused chaos for almost 100,000 passengers Monday,
worries for fans and teams attending the month-long World Cup
starting June 10 and embarrassment for all.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to report Tuesday
to resume training.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest against 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay
cuts. Most of the 3,200 Air France pilots did not work Monday.
	   Departure screens at airports around the nation flashed the bad
news: ``annule'' and ``canceled'' next to list upon list of
flights. Air France planes, many decorated with giant paintings of
soccer players representing the 32 competing teams, sat idle.
	   Passengers at Roissy airport north of Paris were furious.
	   After walking 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Paris to Chartres
over the weekend with 10,000 other youths on a pilgrimage, Ellen
Kerry was trying to get to New York on an Air France flight.
	   ``We only found out when we got in the taxi that there was a
strike. We could have saved the money and walked,'' said Kerry,
whose home is in Virginia.
	   Sharon Borrege said she was trying to get to San Francisco
following a trip to Paris she took after winning Air France tickets
in a raffle at the San Francisco film festival.
	   ``I'm angry. I was told the flight was canceled and to stand in
line,'' said Borrege. ``I love France, but I now I see what they
mean about France's reputation for strikes.''
	   Air France said there would be a slight improvement in traffic
Tuesday, with 16-18 percent of long-haul flights taking off,
compared to 10 percent Monday, and 32 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights scheduled.
	   In total, 44 more flights were scheduled Tuesday, compared to
Monday.
	   Air France, the World Cup's official carrier, is committed to
transporting teams to the 10 competition sites around France. The
company has said if the strike continues it will probably use
outside carriers to meet its obligations.
	   Air France, which almost went bankrupt in 1993, has given no
indication it is ready to withdraw a controversial plan to cut
pilots' salaries in exchange for shares in Air France.
	   Pilots also want Air France to do away with salary cuts for
starting pilots, a system in force for the past year.
	   The strike has left passengers stranded across France at the end
of a long holiday weekend. Lyon and Marseille, France's second and
third-largest cities and World Cup venues, were particularly hit,
as was Paris.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is sending the U.S. team on an American Airlines flight to Paris
that connects to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses for all their travel plans in France.

As usual, Jazz taking low-key approach to dethroning Bulls AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The Utah Jazz are tired of waiting. The
Chicago Bulls are just plain tired.
	   Those are two reasons for the pervasive suspicion that the Jazz
might be a good bet to bring an end to Michael Jordan's dynasty in
the NBA Finals, which begin Wednesday at the Delta Center.
	   With Jordan at full strength, the Bulls have won five
championships in the last seven years. Only when he was away
playing baseball, or just barely back from playing baseball, did
the Bulls fail to win it all.
	   Now Chicago is in the midst of its ``last dance'' _ one final
run at a championship before the team is dismantled. Coach Phil
Jackson seems gone for sure. Scottie Pippen expects to be playing
elsewhere. And Jordan, pondering retirement, might not be playing
at all.
	   A farewell title would be a neat wrapup for a team and player
who have dominated the game in the '90s.
	   But the formidable Jazz stand in the way.
	   ``In the back of all our minds, it's got to be _ This is the
year,'' the Jazz's Greg Foster said.
	   This time, Chicago must win on the road to take the title. Both
teams were 62-20 in the regular season. But the Jazz have the
home-court advantage because they won both meetings of the two
teams.
	   And while the Bulls sweated out a seven-game series against
Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, the Jazz swept the Los
Angeles Lakers in four games. They are rested, and way past ready,
for Wednesday's opener.
	   By the Game 1 tipoff, the Jazz will have gone 10 days without
playing anyone, the second-longest period between playoff games in
NBA history. Utah's players know there is a fine line between being
rested and being rusty.
	   ``With 10 days off, which is an awful lot, we've got to get back
to the type of basketball we were playing against the Lakers,''
Antoine Carr said.
	   The equalizer for the Bulls might be the unmatched desire of
Jordan.
	   ``We may be a little tired,'' he said, ``but our heart isn't
tired, and that's what's important.''
	   It was that heart that was on display the last time the Bulls
played a playoff game in Utah, when Jordan, sweat pouring off his
body as he fought off the flu, scored 38 points in Chicago's 90-88
victory at the Delta Center last year in Game 5. The win put the
Bulls up 3-2, and they won Game 6, and the title, in Chicago.
	   ``A motivated Michael Jordan is a scary thing _ obviously,''
Foster said. ``The guy is such a competitor. I don't know how he's
still playing the game. He's got all the individual accolades and
team accolades you could ever have. He's got all the money in the
world. I don't know what drives him, honestly.''
	   The Jazz need a big series from their MVP, Karl Malone, who
faltered in last year's finals. Malone said the important thing
against Chicago is to play a physical defense that doesn't allow
players to get to the positions they want in the Bulls' triangle
offense.
	   Utah spent most of its long layoff wondering whether it would
play Chicago or Indiana. Monday was the first practice when the
Jazz knew for sure.
	   Utah's experience in its first finals ever last year makes the
team more comfortable in its second appearance.
	   ``We know that every ball counts for something _ every loose
ball, every rebound,'' Carr said. ``You've got to get all the
little things done. If you get all the little things done,
everything else will take care of itself.''

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Pacific Rim nations plan to take concrete steps
this week toward removing trade barriers in the telecommunications
industry, the host of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
said Tuesday.
	   Singapore's communications minister, Mah Bow Tan, said he hoped
a Mutual Recognition Agreement would be reached this week to cut
red tape and ease the selling of telephone equipment across the
region's borders.
	   The pact would allow products to be tested in the exporting
country according to the importing country's standards. That would
eliminate costly duplicated testing and certification, considered
an informal trade barrier.
	   ``We will be charting new directions for further developing the
Asia Pacific Information Society and widening access to information
technologies that will help us live better and work smarter,'' Mah
said.
	   Mah spoke at the opening of a trade fair ahead of a three-day
gathering this week of telecommunications ministers and officials
from around the Pacific Rim. The meeting ends on Friday.
	   For the first time, Mah said, an APEC Cabinet ministers' meeting
will hear from manufacturers, service providers and marketers from
the telecommunications industry. Many industry officials are in
Singapore to attend the communications trade exhibition.
	   Although issues such as transparent rules and equal access to
markets have already been settled between governments, ``the
manufacturers will tell you there are many more pitfalls before the
goods actually get into the market,'' Mah said.
	   APEC ministers may also approve an action program for electronic
commerce: to promote its use by businesses and consumers; to use it
to for government services; to work toward harmonizing the region's
policies; to promote development of infrastructure and new
applications of the system.
	   ``Both of these initiatives are important steps toward enhancing
free and open trade in the APEC region by 2020,'' Mah said.
	   The World Trade Organization estimates business volume conducted
by electronic commerce will reach dlrs 200 billion by 2000, but
issues such as contracts, legal signatures, payment guarantees and
security need to be worked out.
	   Discussions will also be held on creating an electronically
linked, knowledge-based Asia-Pacific Information Society, Mah said.
That task is only beginning because of the different levels of
development, phone density, cable and satellite access available in
the member states.
	   ``It's obvious not every economy is going to be able to benefit
equally from the process,'' Mah said. But no matter what sector of
their economies governments are trying to build up, ``at the end of
the day you need to have that strong telecommunications system.''

Jackson's return to long jump delayed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Colin Jackson, the world record-holder in the
110-meter hurdles, has been delayed again in his return to long
jumping.
	   Jackson, who hopes to double in the hurdles and long jump at
this summer European championships in Budapest, was to long jump
Friday in Milan, but organizers canceled the event.
	   Last month, a bruised heel kept him out of a long jump in Jena,
Germany. He suffered the injury in his first 110 race of the
season.
	   ``Things are working against Colin at the moment,'' said coach
Malcolm Arnold. ``He will just have to look around to see when he
can fit it in again in his schedule.''
	   Jackson is shooting to break the British record of 8.23 meters
(27 feet 0 inches).
	   Jackson has already run 13.14 this season, the top time so far
this year. World and Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the United
States has run a wind-assisted 13.12.

Defense lawyers question police responsibility 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The attorney for the chairman of the
Maccabiah Games charged with negligence in the buckling of a foot
bridge during Israel's Maccabiah Games questioned Tuesday why
police were not held accountable for the collapse.
	   ``The approvals (for the bridge) were signed by all the
appropriate authorities, including the engineer, the fire service
and the police, yet police accountability was never properly
investigated,'' said Dov Weisglass, attorney for Yoram Eyal,
chairman of the Maccabiah organizing committing.
	   Four Australian athletes died and dozens were injured when the
bridge buckled during the July 14 opening ceremony of the Maccabiah
Games last summer.
	   Some 100 Australian athletes were on the foot bridge when it
collapsed and a policeman has testified that he was told to limit
the number of people crossing to 150.
	   A second lawyer, Avraham Landstein, asked chief police
investigator Amiram Omer why he did not look into reports that a
police vehicle was seen on the bridge the day before it collapsed.
	   ``I did not think it appropriate to investigate police
responsibility for the bridge collapse,'' Omer answered.
	   Earlier in the hearing, Omer noted that each of the five
defendants has claimed responsbility for `one aspect of the bridge
which they say is good, and blames the collapse on other parts of
the bridge's construction process.''
	   Two contracters, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
directer of the vent and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee have been charged with negligent homicide and builting
without proper permits. They face up to three years in prison if
convicted.

Russian parliament to hold closed hearings on START II 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with Seleznyov comments.
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament announced Tuesday that it has
decided to move up plans to hold closed-door hearings on the START
II treaty, rescheduling the discussions for next week.
	   However, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov warned that the hearings now
set for June 9 would be shelved if President Clinton continues to
put pressure on Russia to pass the treaty.
	   The hearing had earlier been postponed until the fall, prompting
criticism from Washington.
	   Deputy Speaker Vladimir Ryzhkov announced the decision to hold
the hearings without providing an explanation, the Interfax news
agency said. But after recent nuclear tests carried out by India
and Pakistan, some lawmakers have been urging Russia to show its
commitment to disarmament by finally ratifying START II.
	   Although the hearings have been scheduled, the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, has not set a date for ratification of
the treaty, Seleznyov said at a news conference, according to
Interfax.
	   Clinton has said he doesn't want to come to Moscow for a summit
with Yeltsin until after the treaty has been passed. That prompted
an angry response from Seleznyov.
	   ``Whenever I meet U.S. lawmakers, I ask them to politely tell
their president not to articulate phrases that he will not go to
Russia if START II is not ratified by the State Duma,'' Seleznyov
said.
	   ``If he says the phrase once more, he may count on a
postponement of the discussion of the treaty for an indefinite
period of time. As they say, Russians have their own pride, so when
foreign presidents are trying to impose their dates and terms on
us, we simply don't take it.''
	   Russia's parliament has shown little enthusiasm for the treaty,
which would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals to 3,500
warheads on each side.
	   START II was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has been urging the State Duma to take
quick action.
	   But the Communists and nationalists who dominate the Duma have
stalled, saying that reducing Russia's nuclear arsenal would
further weaken the country's security at a time when conventional
forces are weak.
	   Russian military leaders support ratification. They say that by
2007 _ the treaty's deadline for destroying weapons _ Russia's
intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads will be
at the end of their service lifetime and will have to be discarded
anyway.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin shook his finger at
Russia's most powerful businessmen Tuesday and told them to do more
to keep investors from pulling out of the country's wobbling
financial markets.
	   ``Foreign investors react very quickly,'' he told 10 of Russia's
so-called ``oligarchs,'' the men who control the country's banking
conglomerates. ``If you want foreign investors to keep their money
here then you must tell your own investors not to pull out.''
	   Trying to halt the slide in Russia's financial markets, Yeltsin
summoned government and business leaders to confer with him in the
Kremlin Tuesday.
	   Some of the government's responses appear to be working. After
dropping another 10 percent Monday, the stock market rebounded by 5
percent in trading Tuesday morning.
	   Russia's inept tax collection system is at the heart of the
country's current financial crisis, and Yeltsin also summoned top
law enforcement officials to his office to demand better efforts.
	   ``The tax situation has not improved, only worsened, especially
in recent months,'' a gruff-sounding Yeltsin said in footage
broadcast on national television.
	   Investors' panic began last week, triggered by reverberations
from the Asian financial crisis, a wave of workers' strikes, and a
drop in world oil and gas prices. Russia is heavily dependent on
oil and gas exports.
	   Altogether, the market has fallen 44 percent in the past month,
and many analysts have feared the crisis could lead to a run on the
fragile national currency, the ruble.
	   A top Central Bank official acknowledged Tuesday that the bank
has spent nearly dlrs 1 billion in reserves over the past month to
support the ruble, which strengthened slightly early Tuesday to
around 6.16 to the dollar.
	   Deputy Chairman Sergei Alexashenko said the bank still has dlrs
14.6 billion in reserves, up a low of dlrs 14 billion last week,
and the bank has not had to intervene in recent days.
	   The Russian stock market, whose performance was the world's best
last year, has reversed its fortunes and is this year's
worst-performing exchange. After climbing 98 percent last year, the
market has slid 55 percent since the beginning of the year.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or other lenders, similar to
those arranged after Asia's financial crisis hit last year.
	   But Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Russia would
prefer to lift itself up by its own financial bootstraps.
	   ``The most important thing is to rely on our own resources and
agree on joint responses by government and business and financial
circles,'' he told a news briefing.
	   In the past, Russia has had trouble meeting the stiff conditions
imposed by foreign lenders. The IMF has delayed recent installments
of a dlrs 10 billion loan to try and force Russian compliance with
the terms, which include improved tax collection and limits on
government spending.
	   Moreover, the government doesn't want to worsen the appearance
of crisis, and argues that Russia's underlying economic indicators
remain steady: The economy grew a nominal 0.8 percent last year,
and inflation is in the single digits.
	   As a result, the financial crisis has so far affected only
investors and its effects have not yet reached ordinary Russians.

Congo leader replaces arrested government ministers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila appointed
15 new government ministers on Tuesday after purging his inner
circle of five cabinet members and placing them under arrest.
	   The cabinet was expanded from 27 to 37 ministers and included
two new senior ministers of state, Pierre Victor Mpoy and Deo
Gratias Bugera, Kabila said in a statement.
	   No explanation was given for the appointments and the new
ministers were to be sworn into office in a private ceremony on
Tuesday.
	   Bugera is a trusted confidante of Kabila and a key member of the
rebel movement that swept the president to power over the late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year.
	   Another close Kabila ally, former information minister Raphael
Ghenda, was among five ministers who have been detained in a luxury
government residence since last week.
	   The other four were Celestin Lwanghy, Etienne Mbaya, Kambale
Mututulo and Kokombe Kitete.
	   Kabila has attracted international condemnation for arresting
journalists, political opponents and human rights activists since
coming to power in a rebel takeover last year.
	   The president has dismissed the criticism, saying it originates
from Western imperialist foes and allies of the country's former
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.

Royal blooper at wedding wounds Catholic sensitivities 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The joyous wedding of a Dutch
prince and his commoner girlfriend has sparked a bitter row between
the Roman Catholic Church and the country's Protestant royal
family.
	   Saturday's ecumenical church wedding between Prince Maurits, a
Protestant, and his Catholic bride, Marilene van den Broek, was
without fanfare until the Eucharist was given.
	   At the invitation of one of the officiating clergymen, members
of the royal family, who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church,
participated in the ritual that is reserved for Catholics.
	   The act ``violated the rule and faith of the Catholic Church,''
Jan-Willem Wits, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, said
Tuesday.
	   Those who took the sacrament included ex-queen Juliana, her
husband Prince Bernhard and her daughter Princess Margriet, who is
also the mother of the groom.
	   Queen Beatrix and her consort Prince Claus also attended the
ceremony, but did not participate in the Communion.
	   A spokesman for the royal family was not immediately available
for comment Tuesday.
	   The incident, which has become front-page news, was unusual for
this religiously laid-back country.
	   Ahead of the wedding, the fact that Van den Broek is Catholic
and the royals are Protestants didn't make much of a stir, except
among Calvinist lawmakers who refused to approve a traditional bill
in parliament allowing the nuptials.
	   Historically, hostility between Dutch Catholics and Protestants
goes back four centuries when it was a cause for the Eighty Year
War with Spain.
	   Since William of Orange kicked Spain's Catholic occupiers out of
the Netherlands in the 16th century, every Dutch ruler and regent
has been Protestant.
	   Maurits is the nephew of Queen Beatrix and fifth in line to the
Dutch throne.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries will meet next week to discuss currency
stability and the situation in Russia, a Japanese financial source
said Tuesday.
	   The source told Dow Jones Newswires that the meeting will take
place somewhere in Europe. The source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, didn't elaborate further.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for
international affairs, is expected to attend the meeting, he said.
	   Meanwhile, an official at the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development told Dow Jones Newswires that there
will be a meeting of the organization's Working Part Three in
Paris.
	   The official wasn't able to confirm whether deputy finance
ministers from the G-7 would be meeting around the same time, but
confirmed that U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will
be attending the OECD's WP3 meeting.
	   WP3 is a group of senior treasury and central bank officials
from OECD countries who meet regularly to discuss fiscal, monetary,
currency and balance of payments problems.
	   Its members include the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
	   Officials from the G-7 countries frequently use the WP3
gatherings to get together informally to discuss topics of
particular interest to the group.

U.N. seeks cost-saving rules for emission cuts 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A U.N. conference that agreed last year on
global cuts in ``greenhouse gas'' pollution began debate Tuesday on
cost-saving ways for countries to meet the targets.
	   Officials from some 150 nations are working on rules for
emission credits, under which industrialized countries can claim
credit for helping other countries put in place cleaner technology
_ an idea strongly backed by the United States.
	   Some of these measures can save money by shifting the emission
cuts from industrialized nations into lower-wage countries, said
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the top United Nations official on climate
change.
	   The two-week meeting aims to advance last December's U.N. treaty
on controlling heat-trapping greenhouse gases, which are blamed for
global warming.
	   The accord committed nations for the first time to roll back
emissions _ of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and five
other atmospheric gases _ to pre-1990 levels.
	   New rules for emission credits are to be adopted at a Nov. 2-13
high-level meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
	   One area being discussed is crediting industrialized countries
that finance clean technology projects in developing countries.
Delegates also want to regulate ``trading'' of emission cuts
between industrialized countries allowed under the treaty.
	   Environmental groups and the 15-nation European Union favors a
limit on pollution trading, but the Clinton administration, under
pressure from U.S. industry, is reluctant. Developing countries
have yet to agree on a common stand.
	   Last year's accord in Kyoto, Japan, called for the United States
to reduce greenhouse gases to 7 percent below what they were in
1990. The European Union would cut by 8 percent, Japan by 6
percent.
	   The reductions would have to be attained between 2008 and 2012.
	   No country has ratified the Kyoto treaty yet.

Sanchez Vicario moves into semis 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sanchez Vicario victory; TRIMS.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former French Open champion Aranxta Sanchez Vicario
moved into the semifinals Tuesday with a three-set win over Patty
Schnyder of Switzerland.
	   The fourth-seeded Spaniard lost a tiebreak in the second set but
coasted through the third for a 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 6-0 victory.
	   Sanchez Vicario, who won a contentious match against American
Serena Williams in the fourth round, was the first woman to move
into the semis. She will face either defending champion Iva Majoli
or Lindsay Davenport, who play later Tuesday.
	   But the day's marquee match was between the world's top-seeded
woman, Martina Hingis, and Serena's big sister _ Venus Williams.
	   Williams is playing so well at this year's French Open that the
match between the two young stars is being seen as worthy of the
final.
	   Could there be, finally, a rivalry to match Evert vs.
Navratilova? That's what the tennis world hopes.
	   But Hingis isn't ready to call Venus Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
says. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   ``I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically to Hingis' comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, including a 6-0, 6-4
win in the U.S. Open final last summer, their only previous Grand
Slam encounter.
	   They are 2-2 this year. But Hingis won their only career
encounter on clay, the final of the Italian Open in May.
	   ``It was a good victory for me there,'' Hingis said. ``I hope
she will remember that, too.''
	   Statistically speaking, the two have had an almost identical run
through the early rounds here. Hingis has lost just 14 games while
averaging 56 minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and
averaged 58 minutes per match.
	   But stylistically speaking, they are totally different.
	   Hingis has a masterful touch, moving opponents around the court
with precise groundstrokes. Williams is pure power.
	   Marat Safin, an 18-year-old qualifier, used his power to carve
his way through the first three rounds. His tournament ended on
Monday, however, in five tough sets.
	   The French fans chanted wildly for his opponent, Frenchman
Cedric Pioline. ``Allez Cedric!'' they yelled.
	   But as the match wore on, there were growing chants of ``Ma-RAT!
Ma-RAT!''
	   It was in tribute to the remarkable run by the young Russian
playing his first Grand Slam event. He began the tournament ranked
116th in the world, but won't be there much longer.
	   ``I think I can beat good players now,'' he said after Pioline
ended his run 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Safin's tournament started with three qualifying matches just to
get into the main draw.
	   Next up was Andre Agassi, the former world No. 1 who is in the
midst of a strong comeback. Safin, however, had the answer to every
problem Agassi presented, then ousted defending champion Gustavo
Kuerten, ranked eighth in the world, in another five-setter.
	   In the third round, Safin had a slightly easier time _ needing
only four sets to beat Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   That set up the match with Pioline. The 28-year-old Frenchman is
erratic, but brilliant on occasion. He has reached the finals of
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, both times losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Pioline has a reputation for choking at the end of matches.
Although he has reached 12 singles finals in his career, he has
captured only two titles.
	   Safin knew nothing of that.
	   ``Nobody told me,'' he said.
	   It didn't matter. This time it was Safin who unraveled. Pioline
broke the Russian's serve three times, including once in the fifth
set. That was enough.
	   Safin said he wasn't thrown off his game by the 16,000 fans at
Roland Garros shouting for Pioline. However, the presence of soccer
star Ronaldo in the VIP box was another matter.
	   Asked if he'd been distracted by the Brazilian, in town for the
World Cup, Safin thought for a moment, then announced: ``Yes.''
	   ``I'd never seen Ronaldo so close up before,'' he explained.

Three people injured in Tehran bombing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A bomb hidden in a briefcase exploded
Tuesday afternoon inside the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office in
eastern Tehran, injuring at least three people, police officials
said.
	   No one claimed immediate responsibility.
	   Iran has been gripped by an intensifying power struggle between
the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami and hard-liners
who oppose his social and political reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.
	   The prosecutor's office apprehends and tries Iranians violently
opposed to the revolution, including members of the outlawed
Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   The Iraq-based group, the largest Iranian opposition, is
committed to overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force.

Japan's number of recalled vehicles sets record 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Automakers recalled a 2.59 million vehicles in
Japan the 1997 fiscal year, the most since the government began
tracking the number in 1969, the Transportation Ministry said
Tuesday.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. had the highest number of recalled
vehicles with 1.47 million, followed by Toyota Motor Corp. with
480,000 and Suzuki Motor Corp. with 98,000, said ministry official
Yasuo Shimura.
	   Of the total, recalled imported vehicles totaled 230,000, or 8.9
percent. Among imported brands, BMW had the most vehicles recalled
with 88,000.
	   The total number of recalled vehicles in the last fiscal year
was up 23 percent from the year earlier, Shimura said. Fiscal years
in Japan end on March 31.
	   According to the Transportation Ministry, the increasing supply
of parts by original equipment manufacturers, the sharing of parts
by different vehicles and cost reductions were to blame for the
rise.
	   It said most of the recalls in recent years have been related to
problems with engines, brakes and exhaust pipes.
	   Shimura said the ministry didn't have any figures on the total
cost of the recalls.
	   Recalled vehicles in the last fiscal year amounted to 3.6
percent of all vehicles on the road in Japan. Recalled vehicles in
the U.S. amounted to 9.3 percent in 1995, the most recent period
for which the ministry had data available.

Saudi prince holds more talks on summit, Jordan wants moderate outcome Precede CAIRO 
</HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah held
further talks Tuesday on a proposed Arab summit as Jordan resisted
any move that would have the meeting urge cutting off all ties with
Israel.
	   The meeting came as differences persisted over whether to hold
the summit in Syria or Egypt and over how strong a message the
summit should send to Israel about the breakdown of Middle East
peace talks.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged a summit to clearly
blame Israel for the negotiations stalemate. Israel-Palestinian
talks have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building
a Jewish housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Abdullah met Tuesday with Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother
and heir, following overnight talks with the Jordanian monarch on
the site and the agenda of the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal met with Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani.
	   After the 90-minute session, Anani said that Jordan prefers the
summit be held in the headquarters of the 22-member Arab League in
Cairo, Egypt. ``The context is the most important to us,'' he told
reporters.
	   Syria wants the summit held in its capital, Damascus, where the
government of President Hafez Assad could exert more pressure for a
strong stance against Israel.
	   Underlining disagreements with Syria on the agenda of the
meeting, Anani said more Arab consultations were needed before the
convening of the summit.
	   ``A summit is not something that falls out of a tree ... a
summit must be well prepared,'' he said. ``We don't want to look to
the rest of the world that we are just meeting there to disagree or
meeting there just to exchange blames.''
	   Syria wants the proposed summit to put the brakes on Arabs'
normalization of ties with Israel. At their last summit in 1966,
the Arabs warned of such a step if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu did not keep pledges made in peace talks with
Palestinians.
	   Jordan, the strongest advocate of peace with Israel, is worried
that a hard-line stance could lead to Arab pressures and ultimately
jeopardize close trade and political ties developed since the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   ``There is concern that Jordan and other countries at peace with
Israel might be cornered at the summit,'' said a Jordanian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He told The Associated Press that Jordan wants the summit to
support the Palestinians and the peace process and ``focus on
Israel's stubborn policy rather than giving Israel more excuses to
distance itself from peace.''
	   In Lebanon, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
said he hoped the summit could be held soon and that Egypt, Syria
and Saudi Arabia were all working toward that end.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah met with Assad in Damascus before coming
to Jordan. He was scheduled to return home later Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the visiting U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, said after meeting Anani that
the proposed summit should deal with the peace process with ``a
great deal of care and sensitivity.''

Government begins paying back wages to coal miners 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has begun paying back wages to coal
miners whose recent strikes helped send the Russian financial
markets into a tailspin, news agencies reported Tuesday.
	   The government has paid three months' back wages to miners in
the Kuzbass region, a trade union official told the ITAR-Tass news
agency. The Kuzbass is the country's primary coal area and one of
the centers of the recent unrest.
	   In addition, the Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov as saying the government had begun to make
money available to coal consumers in the Rostov region so they
could repay their debts to coal companies. The coal companies have
said they couldn't pay back wages because they were owed too much
money themselves.
	   Nemtsov said it was incumbent upon the coal companies to repay
their workers once their own debts had been repaid.
	   Last week's collapse of Russian financial markets has been
blamed in part on the repercussions of a 10-day strike by coal
miners who blocked rail lines, paralyzing much of Russia's vast
rail system.
	   Railroad Minister Nikolai Aksenenko said Tuesday that the
blockages had cost the railroads more than 500 million rubles (dlrs
83 million) in losses, Interfax reported. He said that figure would
grow as freight customers demand overdue fines from the railroad.
	   Although the protest accomplished its goal of forcing the
government to begin repaying its debts to the miners, they have
still not received all that they are owed. Even in the Kuzbass
region, where trade union official Anatoly Chekis said wages were
being repaid, the payments fell well short of what the miners were
owed.
	   Chekis said that back wages had been paid for the past three
months' work, but that some miners had not been paid for as long as
six months.
	   ``Now, well-coordinated activities of the federal center are
very important,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass. ``They must
fulfill the protocols signed during the period of rail blockages by
100 percent.''

Singapore prosperity leads to older population 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A decade of increasing prosperity has led to an
older population in Singapore, where better health and education is
tied to longer life and later parenthood, the government said
Tuesday.
	   Singaporeans' median age jumped from 28 to 33 from 1987 to 1997,
while the population grew 2 percent, reaching 3,103,500 last year.
Those over 60 increased from 8.5 percent of the population to 10
percent.
	   The country's increasingly competitive society means more young
men and women have postponed getting married and having babies
until they get higher education degrees and good starts on their
careers.
	   As in many prosperous countries, these couples are having fewer
children than their parents. Those aged 15 to 29 years declined
from 30 percent to 22 percent of the population between 1987 and
1997.
	   Meanwhile, the average years of schooling increased from 8.4 to
10.8.
	   The government is concerned over the falling birth rate,
especially among Singapore's more educated elite, and has
encouraged marriage and more children with tax incentives, media
campaigns and government-run matchmaking services.

Turkey to investigate new Nazi gold claims 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Tuesday it was ready to
investigate new allegations that it received wealth looted from
Jews during World War II in payment for war supplies to the Nazis.
	   A recent U.S. government report concluded that dlrs 300 million
in looted gold, estimated to be worth dlrs 2.6 billion today, was
routed through Switzerland to pay Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
Turkey for German supplies and armaments.
	   ``Turkey has nothing to hide,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Necati Utkan told reporters.
	   He said a commission headed by a state minister would
investigate.
	   Earlier in the year, the same commission denied accusations that
neutral Turkey was involved in looted Nazi gold, arguing that dlrs
3.4 million worth of gold transferred to Turkey via Germany in 1943
was Turkish bullion deposited in Swiss banks.
	   The commission was set up to investigation allegations in a
report released at a London conference in December which concluded
that Turkey, along with other neutral countries of the time, never
repaid a penny of the millions of dollars of looted gold.

Officials plan `robust action' against defiant Bosnian Croats 
</HEADLINE>
By SRECKO LATAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Croats who are
defying new rules designed to improve freedom of movement across
Bosnia face ``robust'' penalties, international officials said
Tuesday.
	   The warning came after Bosnian Croat border guards ignored a
June 1 deadline for doing away with Bosnian Croat license plates
and car documents, completing the switch to Bosnia's new common
license plates and documents.
	   The Croats have even been stopping some cars using the new
plates, United Nations spokesman Alexander Ivanko said.
	   Bosnian Serb and Muslim border guards have been in full
compliance and have turned back all vehicles without new plates and
papers this week, officials said.
	   ``The fact remains that the Croats are not complying at the
moment,'' said Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Bosnia's top
international mediator, Carlos Westendorp. ``If they are not
complying, one suspects that we are going to take more robust
action.''
	   Haselock refused to elaborate, but Ivanko said the U.N. will
decertify all policemen who ignore international instructions.
	   The 1995 Dayton peace accord divided Bosnia into the
Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic. Bosnians traveling
within the country were easily identified by vehicles' plates and
occasionally harassed, beaten or robbed in the areas controlled by
their former foes.
	   Westendorp imposed common neutral symbols, such as the flag,
money and passports, starting last December. He also ordered the
new plates distributed and used exclusively by June 1.
	   The Bosnian Croats refused the design of the common documents,
claiming the use of Cyrillic letters is uniquely a Serb tradition
and therefore against the Muslim-Croat constitution. They have
issued their own version of the new documents, written only in
Latin and not recognized by international officials.
	   Only about 200,000 of Bosnia's 700,000 vehicles in Bosnia had
new plates and documents by Monday, Ivanko said.

Large parts of Kosovo remain sealed off, four police wounded 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid organizations
warned Tuesday of thousands fleeing the upsurge of violence in
restive Kosovo province, where dozens have been killed in the past
several days.
	   No update on casualties was available Tuesday because all
communications with western Kosovo, where Serb forces recently
intensified their campaign to wipe out ethnic Albanian militants
fighting for independence of the southern Serbian province,
remained cut off.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo
population, want independence from Serbia, which rules the province
with a heavy hand.
	   Serb police said ethnic Albanian militants wounded four
policemen Monday, one seriously.
	   Some 2,000 people from Kosovo crossed into northern Albania on
Sunday and Monday. Thousands more have been displaced in Kosovo,
Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees said in
Geneva.
	   Virtually the entire Albanian population of the Kosovo border
villages of Junik and Decane fled under attack, Janowski said. The
U.N. refugee agency believes they fled into surrounding hills.
	   Refugees in Albania said they fled massive shelling by Serbian
forces and spoke of some 1,500 massed in the village of Junik.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the latest bloodshed is the worst since at
least early March, when Serb police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on independence-minded militants and their families.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic Albanian human rights council demanded a
humanitarian corridor be opened in western Kosovo, saying the
people there face hunger.
	   Pajazit Nushi, head of the council and a member of ethnic
Albanian negotiating team, said talks with the government scheduled
for Friday could be canceled.
	   ``I think talks cannot continue if the Serbian side does not
withdraw military and police forces from Kosovo and doesn't stop
the state terror against the Albanians,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, six political parties in Kosovo accused Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic of using the Serb-Albanian talks to
commit crimes against civilians in Kosovo.
	   ``Another Bosnia is happening in Kosovo,'' they warned,
demanding NATO deployment in the province.
	   Refugees talking to The Associated Press on the Albanian side of
the border said they heard of infants inadvertently suffocated by
parents who covered their mouths and noses to stop them from crying
and giving away their location to Serb forces.
	   Serbia, together with smaller Montenegro, make up the Yugoslav
federation.

Indonesia's new government recognizes independent labor union 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS inflaton prediction, 6th graf
By GEOFF SPENCER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new government pushed
ahead with reform Tuesday, recognizing the legitimacy of a
previously suppressed labor union and promising to observe basic
workers' rights.
	   Meanwhile a new estimate of the wealth of former President
Suharto and his family has added pressure on the government to root
out corruption that flourished under his 32-year rule.
	   Suharto quit on May 21 following riots and protests amid the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   An independent economist Christianto Wibisono has estimated the
Suharto family wealth at about dlrs 20 billion, based on the worth
of companies and foundations controlled by them. Other estimates
have ranged up to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Critics claim some of the fortune has been placed abroad and
hould be brought back to help bail out the ailing economy, as
prices and unemployment soars, hurting the majority of Indonesia's
202 million people.
	   Officials have predicted that the inflation could hit 85 percent
in 1998. Central Bureau of Statistics chairman Sugito Suwito warned
that the rate might surpass 100 percent if civil unrest breaks out
again.
	   Indonesia's attorney general's office launched a broad inquiry
on Monday into corruption, including allegations that Suharto's
family abused its position and power to build huge business
empires.
	   Human rights groups criticized Suharto for suppressing workers'
rights and allowing bosses to pay low wages while maintaining
sweatshop conditions. Only one state-sanctioned labor union was
permitted to operate.
	   Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris told reporters Monday that new
President B.J. Habibie would soon ratify an International Labor
Organization convention on workers rights.
	   The government would also officially recognize the Indonesian
Welfare Labor Union, headed by dissident Muchtar Pakpahan, one of
four political prisoners released by the government in recent days,
he said.
	   Pakpahan's organization claims to be Indonesia's largest
independent labor union, although the exact size of its present
membership is unclear.
	   ``According to the labor laws, it meets all criteria to exist,''
the minister said after talks with Habibie, who has promised
sweeping reforms and elections by 1999.
	   Until his release last week, Pakpahan had been serving a
three-year sentence for allegedly organizing a workers' riot on the
island of Sumatra in 1994. Since his release, other charges of
subversion against him have been dropped.
	   Despite continuing announcements of reform measures, some
students protesters, who played a key role in Suharto's ouster,
remain dissatisfied.
	   About 100 students staged a noisy but peaceful protest outside
Parliament Tuesday calling for immediate elections and the
resignation of Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto's.
	   About 50 protesters also gathered outside the U.S. Embassy for a
second day to criticize tough reform demands being made by the
International Monetary Fund. They also accused the United States of
meddling in Indonesian affairs through its calls for more reforms.
	   The Washington-based IMF is now considering whether to restart a
dlrs 43 billion bailout package for Indonesia. The package was
derailed last month when political turmoil hit the world's fourth
most populous nation.
	   Hundreds of students in Padang on Sumatra and Ujung Pandang on
Sulawesi island continued to occupy government buildings in protest
against local official corruption.
	   In disputed East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop
Carlos Belo demanded the Indonesian army withdraw from the
half-island territory, invaded by Suharto's troops in 1975 and
annexed a year later.
	   Belo said he intended to travel to Jakarta and discuss troop
withdrawals with Habibie and Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto.
	   Habibie has said he won't change the government's policy on East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony.
	   The United Nations has never recognized Indonesia's claim to the
island, which was briefly an independent nation after the
Portuguese pulled out.

Eritreans face Ethiopians at disputed border area; reports Sudan bombing Eritrean villages 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has sent reinforcements to border
areas disputed by Ethiopia, and Eritrean officers insist that
neutral observers could verify that Ethiopian troops had occupied
Eritrean territory, a photographer who visited the area said
Tuesday.
	   In Badme, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southwest of Asmara,
Eritrean troops, tanks and artillery face Ethiopian positions on a
ridge, the photographer, on assignment for The Associated Press,
said.
	   And an agricultural worker who returned Tuesday to Asmara from
western Eritrea said Sudan had bombed several villages in another
part of Eritrea near Tessenei, 230 kilometers (143 miles) west of
Asmara. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report.
	   Eritrea is hosting the rebel Sudanese National Democratic
Alliance, and unconfirmed reports in the past have indicated the
NDA has attacked Sudan from bases in western Eritrea.
	   Eritrean officers in Badme, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Ethiopians were 16 kilometers (10 miles) inside Eritrea,
according to the boundary drawn by Italian colonizers in the 19th
century.
	   One officer said Eritreans want a neutral party with
colonial-era maps and a Global Positioning System to visit the
border to determine who is where.
	   The photographer said Eritrean reinforcements continued arriving
in the area late Monday.
	   Civilians abandoned Badme and surrounding villages in the Yirga
triangle and moved north after Eritrean forces blocked an Ethiopian
advance last week, the officers said.
	   In Asmara, tarpaulin-covered trucks carrying what appeared to be
artillery pieces headed toward Dekemhare, a military garrison town
about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Asmara.
	   Since its first public comment on the border dispute May 13,
Ethiopia has repeatedly claimed that Eritreans have made incursions
into Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea denies the claims and has suggested international
mediation. Ethiopia rejects direct negotiations until Eritrea
withdraws and threatened to use force if it did not.
	   Italy occupied what is now Eritrea from 1885 to 1941. Then it
became a British-administered territory until 1962, when Ethiopia
annexed it.
	   After a 30-year war, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia
in 1993, and according to standards established by the Organization
of African Unity, the border agreed upon was the one drawn by the
Italians.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrea is illegally occupying the 400-sq.
km. (160-sq.-mile) Yirga triangle in northwestern Ethiopia as well
as other areas in the northeast.
	   Eritrea has an estimated population of 3.67 million, compared to
about 57 million in Ethiopia.
	   An estimated 100,000 Ethiopians live in Eritrea. An official at
the Ethiopian Embassy in Asmara said Tuesday few of them appeared
to be returning to Ethiopia.
	   President Isias Afwerki said in a nationwide television address
Saturday that the border problem was one between governments and
not peoples.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah held
further talks Tuesday on a proposed Arab summit as Jordan resisted
any move that would have the meeting urge cutting off all ties with
Israel.
	   The meeting came as differences persisted over whether to hold
the summit in Syria or Egypt and over how strong a message it
should send to Israel about the breakdown of Middle East peace
talks.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged a summit to clearly
blame Israel for the negotiations stalemate. Israel-Palestinian
talks have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building
a Jewish housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Abdullah met Tuesday with Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother
and heir, following overnight talks with the Jordanian monarch on
the site and the agenda of the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal met with Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani.
	   After the 90-minute session, Anani said Jordan prefers the
summit be held in the headquarters of the 22-member Arab League in
Cairo, Egypt. ``The context is the most important to us,'' he told
reporters.
	   Syria wants the summit held in its capital, Damascus, where the
government of President Hafez Assad could exert more pressure for a
strong stance against Israel.
	   Underlining disagreements with Syria on the agenda of the
meeting, Anani said more Arab consultations were needed before the
convening of the summit.
	   ``A summit is not something that falls out of a tree ... a
summit must be well prepared,'' he said. ``We don't want to look to
the rest of the world that we are just meeting there to disagree or
meeting there just to exchange blames.''
	   Syria wants the proposed summit to put the brakes on Arabs'
normalization of ties with Israel. At their last summit in 1966,
the Arabs warned of such a step if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu did not keep pledges made in peace talks with
Palestinians.
	   Jordan, the strongest advocate of peace with Israel, is worried
that a hard-line stance could lead to Arab pressures and ultimately
jeopardize close trade and political ties developed since the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   ``There is concern that Jordan and other countries at peace with
Israel might be cornered at the summit,'' said a Jordanian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He told The Associated Press that Jordan wants the summit to
support the Palestinians and the peace process and ``focus on
Israel's stubborn policy rather than giving Israel more excuses to
distance itself from peace.''
	   In Lebanon, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
said he hoped the summit could be held soon and that Egypt, Syria
and Saudi Arabia were all working toward that end.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah met with Assad in Damascus before coming
to Jordan. He was scheduled to return home later Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the visiting U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, said after meeting Anani that
the proposed summit should deal with the peace process with ``a
great deal of care and sensitivity.''

Arianespace confident of Asian business despite slowdown

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ European aerospace consortium Arianespace is
confident of its business in Asia despite the economic slowdown
that is cutting public and private spending across the region, the
company's chief said Tuesday.
	   The French-based company has seven launches on its order books
for 1998-99 from Asian customers, worth an estimated 4 billion
French francs (dlrs 671 million), chairman and chief executive
officer Jean-Marie Luton said in an address at the CommunicAsia98
trade fair.
	   ``Where we see some difficulties (is with) delayed payments and
things like this,'' Luton acknowledged. But he said the company has
not felt much negative effect from the Asian financial crisis, and
no cancellations or postponements were expected.
	   ``Some of (our customers) have difficulties,'' Luton later told
Dow Jones Newswires. ``But, day by day, we see they've found
solutions for launching the satellites.''
	   The consortium launched the Japanese BSAT-1b satellite for NHK
in April, and expects to carry India's Insat 2E and Singapore's
ST-1 satellites later this year. Next year's five launches for
private and government-linked customers include satellites from
Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, and a joint Laos-Thailand project.
	   Asia's annual contribution to Arianespace's total revenue is
likely to slip to 25 percent this year, down from last year's 30
percent, Luton said.
	   The consortium's total revenues last year were 6.5 billion
French francs (dlrs 1.1 billion), showing moderate growth of 4
percent from the previous year.
	   Luton was somewhat optimistic about the company's long-term
business outlook in Asia. He said the region may recover from its
economic slump more quickly than expected, and the company sees the
region as a source of major growth in the telecommunications
industry, a mainstay of the aerospace business.
	   He said Arianespace ``will offer the lowest possible prices ...
and at the same time, will increase the performance'' of their
latest rockets, notably the Ariane 5 launcher.
	   He forecast increased payloads in the future. He also predicted
the ability to deliver multiple satellites into low orbit by 2000
or 2001 to take advantage of the trend toward so-called
``constellation'' satellites that circle the globe in large number.
They would make satellite telephone networks available with just a
handset that can be used globally.
	   Arianespace's competitors from China, Russia and the United
States have successfully launched multiple ``constellation''
satellites over the past year, and in September the first such
network of 66 satellites will become fully operational.

Spain rejects U.S. accusation that it trafficked in Nazi gold BY CIARAN GILES 
</HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) (AP) _ Spain denied Tuesday new allegations
from the U.S. State Department that the country under dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco sold war material to Hitler in exchange for gold
stolen from Jewish victims of Nazism.
	   ``Spain did not launder Nazi gold stolen or looted from the
Jews,'' Foreign Minister Abel Matutes told reporters. He said Spain
stood by its investigation into the issue that confirmed the
country had acted correctly in its business dealings with Nazi
Germany.
	   Matutes reacted to reports of fresh allegations by historians
and experts of the U.S. State Department that Spain under Franco
played a ``crucial role' in laundering Nazi gold.
	   The Eizenstat report says Spain was a leading exporter of
wolfram metal to Germany, used in the making of canons and armored
plating, and that it was frequently paid in gold.
	   Matutes said Spain's exports of wolfram have never been a secret
and added that the fact that the country sometimes was paid with
gold did not constitute a charge against Spain.
	   He said that Spain's position regarding the investigation into
the origin and destiny of Nazi gold has always been ``clear and
honest.''
	   Spain and four other technically neutral countries in World War
II have been accused of handing back less than 20 percent of the
looted Nazi gold estimated to be stashed in their banks.
	   In April, a Spanish government commission presented a report in
which it absolved Franco's regime of responsibility for the
purchase of gold from Germany, saying it did so out of economic
necessity in the aftermath of the devastating Spanish Civil War and
that the transactions were ``judicially impeccable.''
	   It said Spain bought a total of 67 tons of gold, worth
approximately dlrs 765 million today, from a variety of sources
topped by Swiss banks.
	   An earlier U.S. investigation estimated Spanish wartime gold
purchases at some 123 tons, almost double the commission's figure,
and said most of it originally belonged to Holocaust victims.
	   According to the Spanish report, the U.S. figure was probably
boosted by the inclusion of Portuguese gold purchases as well as
those of German organizations in Spain.
	   Although the Spanish report absolved Spain of moral or legal
responsibility, it recommended that the government make an
unspecified donation to the World Sephardi Organization as an
expression of solidarity rather than in compensation for
wrongdoing.

Milosevic silent over Montenegro elections 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic remained conspicuously silent Tuesday over a major
election triumph by his foes in Montenegro, who pledged to defy him
and push for more democracy.
	   Milosevic's reaction to the election victory of a coalition led
by reform-minded Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic could
determine whether Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and small
Montenegro, breaks up or moves toward democratic changes.
	   Milosevic's ally Momir Bulatovic, who lost the elections, was
summoned to Belgrade for urgent consultations with the hard-lining
Yugoslav president. There was no word from the meeting.
	   Djukanovic and his aides are determined to stack Montenegro's
bloc with their supporters, and hope to team up with the Serbian
opposition to either unseat Milosevic or at least weaken his rule.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
Milosevic has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic's presidential victory last October coupled with
Sunday's parliamentary victory seriously weakened Milosevic's grip
on the Yugoslav federation.
	   Djukanovic said in an interview with the independent Belgrade
Radio Index Tuesday that Milosevic ``will have to accept the new
Montenegrin political reality.''
	   He accused Milosevic of destroying Yugoslavia with his
``arrogant obstinacy'' and said Milosevic ``will have to take the
blame for the collapse of the country which he is running'' if he
continues attempts to subjugate Montenego.
	   Djukanovic first challenged the Yugoslav power-broker in the
winter of 1996-1997, coming out against Milosevic during massive
protests against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin then narrowly beat Bulatovic _ his
former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office in January.
	   The strength of his triumph in Sunday's elections will hand him
a majority in the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament.
	   Djukanovic said in the radio interview that he would insist on
Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic maneuvered
his protege into that office two weeks ago after the previous
premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western reforms.
	   Djukanovic's aides have suggested that he would seek holding a
referendum in Montenegro on the republic's secession from
Yugoslavia if Milosevic doesn't replace Bulatovic.

Large parts of Kosovo remain sealed off, four police wounded target Serb civilians 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian official urging militants not to
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid organizations
warned Tuesday of thousands fleeing the upsurge of violence in
restive Kosovo, which has claimed dozens of lives in the past
several days.
	   All communications with western Kosovo, where Serb forces
recently intensified their campaign to wipe out ethnic Albanian
militants, remained cut off Tuesday, so no update on possible new
casualties was available.
	   Serb police said four policemen were wounded Monday, one
seriously, by ethnic Albanian militants fighting for independence
of Kosovo from Serbia.
	   Serbs say their forces in western Kosovo are fighting
guerrillas, who are fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
But ethnic Albanians and international aid officials spoke of
shelled villages and civilians fleeing.
	   Some 2,000 people from Kosovo crossed into northern Albania on
Sunday and Monday. Thousands more have been displaced in the
province itself, Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees said in Geneva.
	   Virtually the entire Albanian population of the Kosovo border
villages of Junik and Decane fled under attack, the spokesman said.
The U.N. refugee agency doesn't know where they are but thinks they
must be in surrounding hills.
	   Refugees interviewed in Albania said they fled massive shelling
by Serbian forces. They spoke of some 1,500 massed in the village
of Junik.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the latest bloodshed is the worst since at
least early March, when Serb police killed more than 80 people in a
crackdown on independence-minded militants and their families.
	   There were no reports on casualties from fighting Tuesday, but
the Serbian pro-government information center reported four
policemen wounded on Monday.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic Albanian human rights council demanded a
humanitarian corridor be opened for western Kosovo, saying the
people there face hunger.
	   Pajazit Nushi, head of the council and a member of ethnic
Albanian negotiating team, said talks with the government scheduled
for Friday could be canceled.
	   ``I think talks cannot continue if the Serbian side does not
withdraw military and police forces from Kosovo and doesn't stop
the state terror against the Albanians,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, six political parties in Kosovo accused Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic of using the Serb-Albanian talks to
commit crimes against civilians in Kosovo.
	   ``Another Bosnia is happening in Kosovo,'' they warned,
demanding NATO deployment in the province.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo
population, want independence from Serbia, which rules the province
with a heavy hand. But the population is split on whether to use
force to achieve it.
	   Adem Demaqi, a prominent ethnic Albanian leader known as
Kosovo's Mandela for the years he spent in Serbian prisons,
appealed Tuesday to the Kosovo Liberation Army to refrain from
targeting innocent Serb civilians in retaliation for police
brutality.
	   The statement by Demaci's Parliamentary Party of Kosovo is the
first public message to the militants by any of the Albanian
political parties in Kosovo, most of whom deny the existence of the
organized militant movement.

Israeli defense minister meets Mubarak, explains Israeli stance CHANGES headline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments from Mubarak, Mordechai, Mubarak aide;
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
met with Egypt's president Tuesday about the Middle East peace
process, which is stalemated by Israel's failure to accept a U.S.
compromise on a West Bank withdrawal.
	   After the nearly three-hour session, President Hosni Mubarak's
chief political adviser Osama el-Baz said Mordechai had sought to
explain the Israelis' misgivings toward the American proposal.
	   ``According to them, the 13 percent might not be the ideal
percentage,'' el-Baz said. He added that for the Israel, ``the
important thing is to start the final status negotiations after the
withdrawal.''
	   Only one of three scheduled withdrawals outlined in
Israel-Palestinian peace pacts has taken place, but Israel has
pushed to move on to negotiations on a final peace agreement
between the two sides.
	   To break a more than year-long stalemate in the talks, the
United States has proposed a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops
from 13 percent more of West Bank land in exchange for Palestinians
steps to increase security for Israelis.
	   The Palestinians now have complete control over about 3 percent
of the land _ the cities and large towns _ and share control with
Israel over a further 23 percent. Under the U.S. plan they'd fully
hold 16 percent, with shared area remaining 23 percent.
	   El-Baz said the talks between Mubarak and Mordechai also
``touched upon'' Israel's nuclear capabilities and reporters'
questions to the two concentrated on that issue following the
recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   Mubarak used the opportunity to expand on his proposal for a
nuclear-free Middle East, telling reporters, ``Now I demand that
there becomes a principle to eliminate all nuclear weapons in the
world on a phase of several years.''
	   Mordechai, asked if Israel would sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, said only, ``We would like to sign a
peace agreement.''
	   Reporters were told by officials at Mubarak's Unity palace that
the Egyptian president and Mordechai began their meetings without
aides present.
	   Mubarak, a former pilot and air force general, said in reference
to Mordechai's military career that ``the people who witnessed wars
and killings are people who understand the true meaning of wars and
death.''
	   The Israeli minister's trip comes a day after the Israeli
Cabinet discussed the U.S. compromise but reached no decision. The
American proposal is meant to restart peace talks stalled since
March 1997 when Israel began a Jewish settlement in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who initially wanted a 30
percent withdrawal, has accepted the U.S. compromise.
	   The Iraqi-born Mordechai is viewed as on the moderate side of
Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet. He has urged a ``double-digit''
withdrawal, seen as a vote for the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel has argued pulling back from more than 9 percent of the
land would endanger its security. Jewish settlers, who want to
retain all the West Bank for Israel, have complained that a larger
pullback would isolate some of their settlements.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv had said that in Tuesday's talks
Mordechai hoped to convince Mubarak to scuttle a planned Arab
summit to discuss Mideast peace.
	   But el-Baz made no mention of the summit coming up. Arab leaders
have been discussing holding such a meeting, but they are torn by
their usual squabbles between those wanting a hard-line stance
against Israel and others espousing a more moderate line.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Forty-six countries joined Tuesday in demanding
that India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and
join in the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' said a joint statement.
	   Islamic countries and others, while expressing concern about the
tests, also criticized the five nuclear powers _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States.
	   They urged the five powers to drop their opposition to proposed
negotiations for the scheduled elimination of their atomic
arsenals.
	   India said that, if the five powers had accepted its previous
attempts to set up global nuclear disarmament, ``we need not have
gone in for our current testing program.''
	   The five powers were among the countries that backed the joint
statement before an emergency meeting of the 61-nation Conference
on Disarmament.
	   It said India's and Pakistan's tests ``blatantly undermine''
attempts to halt nuclear proliferation and threaten to undermine
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons.
	   The statement, read by Clive Pearson, New Zealand's ambassador
to the conference, said India's and Pakistan's explosions in May
were ``provocative and dangerous acts.''
	   ``Indulging in competitive maneuvers ... belongs to a bygone
age,'' said Pearson.
	   He said, ``It is now crucial that India and Pakistan announce
immediately a cessation to all further testing of these weapons,
renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and ratify
unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.
	   Iran said it viewed the developments with ``deep concern,'' but
also urged the declared nuclear powers ``to fulfill their
commitment to nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework.''
	   ``In the absence of an all-encompassing program for
comprehensive nuclear disarmament the status and future of the NPT
(Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) will face great uncertainty,''
said Iranian Ambassador Bozorgmehr Ziaran.
	   Despite Tehran's denials, Iran is widely believed to be pursuing
its own nuclear-weapons program.
	   On Monday Iran's foreign minister said on a visit to Islamabad
that Muslims welcomed Pakistan's nuclear tests because it gives the
Islamic world a bomb to counter Israel's widely suspected arsenal.
	   Other nonnuclear nations joined in urging the five nuclear
powers to commit themselves to nuclear disarmament.
	   ``The South African government believes that these developments
have made it even more imperative that the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva should now actively and with determination
address the issue of nuclear disarmament,'' said Ambassador Jacob
S. Selebi, head of the South African delegation.
	   Australia, which joined with New Zealand in invoking the
emergency session, urged other countries ``to pursue the objective
of a nuclear-weapon-free world.''

Moscow to encourage Russian companies in Iraq oil-for-food deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it will
``vigorously'' help Russian companies that want to participate in
Iraq's oil-for-food program.
	   The program, an exception to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, allows Baghdad to sells dlrs 5.2 billion
worth of oil every six months to buy food and humanitarian
supplies.
	   Russian companies must be involved in ``both the purchase of
Iraqi oil and the supply to Baghdad of humanitarian goods, above
all, Russian-made ones,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin told reporters.
	   ``We regard the operation as an important temporary step
designed to alleviate the humanitarian problem in Iraq before the
embargo is completely lifted,'' Nesterushkin said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   France, Russia, and China, which all advocated lifting the
sanctions on Iraq, have also been involved the most of the
oil-for-food program that began in December 1996.
	   Iraq has repeatedly said it will favor countries supporting its
fight against U.N. embargo in trade deals.
	   Moscow intends to ``vigorously'' assist Russian companies that
want to do more such business, Nesterushkin said.

Royal blooper at wedding wounds Catholic sensitivities 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from spokesman for royal family.
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The joyous wedding of a Dutch
prince and his commoner girlfriend has sparked a bitter row between
the Roman Catholic Church and the country's Protestant royal
family.
	   Saturday's ecumenical church wedding between Prince Maurits, a
Protestant, and his Catholic bride, Marilene van den Broek, was
without fanfare until the Eucharist was celebrated.
	   At the invitation of one of the officiating clergymen, members
of the royal family, who belong to the Dutch Reformed Church,
participated in the ritual that is reserved for Catholics.
	   The act ``violated the rule and faith of the Catholic Church,''
Jan-Willem Wits, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church, said
Tuesday.
	   Those who took the sacrament included ex-queen Juliana, her
husband Prince Bernhard and her daughter Princess Margriet, who is
also the mother of the groom.
	   Queen Beatrix and her consort Prince Claus also attended the
ceremony, but did not participate in the Communion.
	   A spokesman for the royal family, Eef Brouwers, said their
religious beliefs were a private matter and decline to comment
further.
	   The affair, which has become front-page news, was unusual for
this religiously laid-back country.
	   Ahead of the wedding, the fact that Van den Broek is Catholic
and the royals are Protestants didn't make much of a stir, except
among Calvinist lawmakers who refused to approve a traditional bill
in parliament allowing the nuptials.
	   Historically, hostility between Dutch Catholics and Protestants
goes back four centuries when it was a cause for the Eighty Year
War with Spain.
	   Since William of Orange kicked Spain's Catholic occupiers out of
the Netherlands in the 16th century, every Dutch ruler and regent
has been Protestant.
	   Maurits is the nephew of Queen Beatrix and fifth in line to the
Dutch throne.

Policeman heckles Northern Ireland Secretary over prisoner releases 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A police officer angered by
plans to free paramilitary prisoners as part of a new peace deal
heckled Britain's senior official in Northern Ireland Tuesday.
	   As Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam stood to address the
Northern Ireland Police Federation, Constable Gordon Taylor, whose
colleague died in an IRA bomb attack, shouted, ``Three hundred
police officers murdered. No prisoner releases.''
	   Taylor held up a newspaper listing some 300 police officers
murdered in almost 30 years of ``troubles'' in the British-ruled
province.
	   Taylor, who is stationed in predominantly Catholic West Belfast,
said later that most Royal Ulster Constabulary officers had voted
against the agreement in the May 22 referendum because of the plan
to release up to 400 paramilitary prisoners within two years.
Seventy-one percent of voters approved the plan.
	   Taylor said had been a police officer for just 11 days in 1989
when his colleague was killed in front of his wife and children by
a bomb placed under his car.
	   ``Police officers are only human,'' he said of his protest.
``This was a human reaction.''
	   Earlier, delegates applauded federation chairman Les Rodgers
when he said members were ``dismayed and appalled'' at plans to
release prisoners.
	   ``I have to tell you that there are people in the Maze and
Maghaberry prisons who, by any objective measurement, should not
only not get out within the next two years, they should never get
out,'' Rodgers said, speaking directly to Mowlam.
	   ``In any other society, serial killers are kept behind lock and
key for life. It is a pity that for political expediency we should
be an exception.'' The federation represents most of the province's
13,000 police officers.
	   Mowlam said she sympathized with Taylor, but the peace deal
could not have been struck without the agreement to release
prisoners.
	   ``It is very difficult and I understand when Constable Taylor
expresses that view,'' she said. ``No one wanted to do it
willingly. But any other agreement that had taken place,
accelerated releases is part of it.''
	   Half the 400 prisoners were due to be released within two years
anyway, she said.
	   Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair said Tuesday that freed
paramilitaries will not be allowed to join the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which is due to be reorganized. Some officers have
expressed fears that they could end up serving alongside killers.
	   Blair, who met in Belfast with leaders of the eight political
parties who have signed up to the deal, said allowing
paramilitaries to join ``would be quite wrong.''
	   Prince Charles was also in the province on Tuesday at the start
of a two-day visit. The heir to the throne opened a center for
peace and reconciliation at Ballycastle, 45 miles (70 kms) north of
Belfast.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A decade of increasing prosperity has led to an
older population in Singapore, where better health and education is
tied to longer life and later parenthood, government statistics
released Tuesday showed.
	   Singaporeans' median age jumped from 28 to 33 from 1987 to 1997,
while the population grew 2 percent, reaching 3,103,500 last year,
according to the government's annual statistics report. Those over
60 increased from 8.5 percent of the population to 10 percent.
	   The country's increasingly competitive society means more young
men and women have postponed getting married and having babies
until they get higher education degrees and good starts on their
careers.
	   As in many prosperous countries, these couples are having fewer
children than their parents. Those aged 15 to 29 years declined
from 30 percent to 22 percent of the population between 1987 and
1997.
	   Meanwhile, the average years of schooling increased from 8.4 to
10.8.
	   The government is concerned over the falling birth rate,
especially among Singapore's more educated elite, and has
encouraged marriage and more children with tax incentives, media
campaigns and government-run matchmaking services.

Danish international signs four-year contract with AC Milan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Danish international midfielder Thomas
Helveg has signed a four-year contract with AC Milan, the
powerhouse owned by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi announced
Tuesday.
	   The 26-year-old Dane joins some known faces at Milan - German
striker Oliver Bierhoff and coach Alberto Zaccheroni who were with
him at Udinese until last season.
	   The Italian coach and Bierhoff signed with the Milan club last
month.
	   Team officials said Helveg's contract will last through June 30,
2002. Terms were not disclosed.
	   However soccer circles suggested Milan paid Udinese a transfer
fee of about 15 billion lire (dlrs 8.3 million) for Helveg.
	   The Dane had been playing with Udinese since 1993.
	   Milan is through a major reshuffle of players and technicians
for the 1998-99 soccer season after two consecutive disappointing
years.

Gascoigne admits he was drunk the night before he was cut taken Gascoigne

Eds: ADDS opinion polls supporting Hoddle; Venables would have
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne says he was drunk the night before
he was cut from the England World Cup team.
	   Gascoigne, the 31-year-old midfielder who was dropped Sunday by
coach Glenn Hoddle for a lack of fitness, spoke about the incident
in a front-page story in Tuesday's tabloid Sun newspaper.
	   ``Yes, I was drunk. I'd not had a drink in nine days,'' he said
in the interview, his first since being unexpectedly cut while
training in Spain.
	   Gascoigne, who has been criticized for his reported
hard-drinking and smoking 20 cigarettes a day, said he left the bar
in La Manga, Spain, had sandwiches in his room with teammate David
Seaman, and then ``crashed out.''
	   Gascoigne also said he had been drinking beer during a Sunday
golf game just hours before he met with Hoddle.
	   Given the bad news, the star of England's 1990 World Cup team
admitted he exploded.
	   ``He looked at me and said, `Paul, I'm sorry but you're not
coming to France. You're not fit enough'.''
	   ``I completely lost it. I went mad, berserk. I lost my rag big
time. I was shouting and swearing. I couldn't believe the injustice
of it.
	   ``I was swearing, Everything came out. I let go of all the
emotion building up inside me. I was so hurt.
	   ``I admit I kicked the door, kicked the furniture. I let my
frustration go.''
	   ``I was crying and out of control. I didn't want to talk to
anybody and I didn't want to listen to what Glenn had to say. There
is nothing he could say.''
	   Gascoigne, ranked as one of England's best midfielders, has made
more headlines recently for his play off the soccer field. In a
highly publicized incident, he admitted beating his estranged wife
Sheryl and late apologized for it.
	   He's also been panned by British newspapers for his widely
reported late-night capers with show business friends.
	   Opinion polls have supported Hoddle's move.
	   In a poll for GMTV, 62 percent of 8,000 caller supported Hoddle,
and telephone poll by the Daily Mail showed 53 percent backing the
coach.
	   However, former England coach Terry Venables said he would have
kept Gascoigne.
	   ``If we are talking about a decision based purely on Gazza's
fitness then I would have taken him in a squad of 22,'' Venables
said.
	   ``I would have taken him, watched his progress and been prepared
to put him on the bench or even in the team depending on how he
developed,'' he added.

Havel says he is tired of everything 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel said he is
``fed up with everything'' from the media to his office staff, who
do not work hard enough in his absence.
	   ``I'm fed up with everything,'' Havel told a minister. ``With my
... office, which became lazy as I haven't been there for a long
time already; with the political situation; with what the
newspapers write.''
	   Havel made the remarks to Minister without portfolio Vladimir
Mlynar just before a meeting at his residence in Lany on Monday.
Photographers and TV cameramen were allowed in the room for a photo
opportunity at the beginning of the meeting.
	   Private NOVA television picked up the remarks and aired them on
its evening news.
	   ``When the president realized his words were recorded, he
apologized to the workers of his office,'' Havel's spokesman
Ladislav Spacek said Tuesday.
	   ``The president was in bad mood and said that as a private
remark to his good friend of many years without knowing his words
could be heard by others too,'' Spacek said.
	   Havel is in Lany outside of Prague recuperating from urgent
abdominal surgery he underwent in Austria in April.
	   Surgery to remove a tube that was inserted into his colon, and
was originally planned for mid-June, was postponed for at least a
month to avoid any unnecessary risks.
	   Havel suffered a ruptured colon and acute peritonitis while on
vacation in Austria. His recovery was complicated by breathing
problems after phlegm blocked his windpipe, forcing doctors to
perform a tracheotomy.

Romario dropped from Brazilian roster; Emerson called as replacement, Bebeto likely starter

	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ Romario, Brazil's hero from the 1994
World Cup and half of the defending champion's ``Ro-Ro'' forward
combination, was dropped from the squad Tuesday, hours before final
rosters were to be submitted to FIFA for France '98.
	   Time ran out for Romario in his race to recover from an injury
in his right calf, apparently incurred while he was playing
``foot-volleyball'' on a Rio de Janeiro beach last month.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo waited till the last minute for his
32-year-old forward, who had a personalized training plan and even
tried a spiritual healer. But on Sunday it became clear he couldn't
recover in time for Brazil's opening game against Scotland on June
10.
	   ``Things are happy for some, sadness for others. But now I think
you're all sad as I am. I don't want to mean this is a farewell
from soccer,'' he said.
	   After breaking down again and covering his face with his hands,
Romario said: ``I will now probably learn how to value other
things.
	   ``This won't be a goodbye from me. I'm sure it's not over,''
Romario said in a whisper, then broke down in tears and left the
table to cheers and applause.
	   His replacement on the 22-player roster is Emerson, a midfielder
of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen. Zagallo said the new starter
alongside two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo will be Bebeto,
Romario's co-star on the '94 team.
	   The training camp was abuzz when Zagallo unexpectedly canceled
morning practice and called a news conference outside the stately
chateau that houses the team in this sleepy suburb of Paris.
	   ``We have bad news,'' began Lidio Toledo, the team's doctor.
Romario had reinjured his bad leg during training last Saturday,
while the rest of the team was heading to Spain for an exhibition
game.
	   Although a first MRI test had showed nothing, a second test last
Saturday revealed serious swelling in the muscle.
	   ``He could reinjure it again any time,'' Toledo said. ``This
kind of injury could take 10, 15, 20 days or even a month to
heal.''
	   Former star Zico, now the team's coordinator, was one of the
sole voices that had spoken out against taking an injured player to
the Cup. He recalled his own experience in 1986, when he went
injured and missed a penalty shot that led Brazil to elimination by
France in the quarterfinals.
	   ``We are very sad that Romario is leaving,'' said Zico. ``But we
have the responsibility to continue on and win a fifth world title.
For this we have the drive and the talent. There always will be
somebody ready to replace anyone else.''
	   Zagallo, who had faced down charges that he was coddling
Romario, said the team's high command had decided against calling
another forward because of several midfielders also play forward.
	   In addition to forwards Ronaldo, Bebeto and Edmundo, Rivaldo,
Giovanni and Denilson also have played in the front line.
	   Meanwhile, starting midfielders Dunga and Cesar Sampaio have
been sidelined by injuries. Although they have recovered, Zagallo
felt the team needed more depth at that position.
	   ``This way we're covered,'' Zagallo said. ``Emerson has good
technical qualities and plays on the right side. It was just good
sense.''
	   With four World Cup titles to his credit as player, coach or
team coordinator, Zagallo shrugged off the loss of Romario. In
1994, he recalled, Brazil lost its two starting fullbacks to
injuries and was champion with reserves Marcio Santos and Aldair.
	   The cut almost certainly ends Romario's career on the national
team, where he scored 52 goals in 70 games. His greatest moment was
at the '94 Cup, when he led Brazil with five goals and was voted
the tournament's Most Valuable Player
	   Although four years older and a step slower, Romario remains a
team leader, highly popular and respected by the other players _
especially Ronaldo. His loss could be a psychological blow to
Brazil.
	   ``This is a very difficult moment for me,'' said Romario. ``But
who knows? Maybe now I'll begin to appreciate the other things in
life.''

It's end of the road for penalty corner specialists 
</HEADLINE>
By MANDY MANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Penalty corner executioners, those
crack specialists who came off the bench to give it their best
shot, are now a part of field hockey history.
	   The World Cup that concluded Monday marked the end of the road
for the latest dinosaurs in an evolving sport that's placing a new
emphasis on free-flowing action to win more sponsors and TV
viewers.
	   Penalty corner specialists, who would step up from the bench to
slam the ball into the boards or scoop it into the cage, lived a
charmed existence for six years before the International Hockey
Federation, or FIH, decided to veto the practice.
	   In the future, teams wanting to employ crack penalty corner
executioners will have to field them in the playing eleven.
	   ``That's how it should be,'' said Ric Charlesworth, coach of the
Australian women's team, which won its second World Cup on Sunday.
	   ``We've always believed in making one of the players on the
pitch take the penalty corner. The new rule will abolish stoppages
caused by such changeovers,'' Charlesworth said.
	   Crack penalty corner shooters used to figure in the playing
eleven even if their main utility was to score with rasping penalty
corner shots.
	   But the introduction of the rolling substitution rule after the
1992 Barcelona Olympics brought into vogue specialists whose
appearances during matches was restricted to half a minute for
every penalty corner.
	   The new rule will force several star players, such as crack
Dutch shooter Bram Lomans, England's Calum Giles and Sohail Abbas
of Pakistan, to reorient the course of their hockey careers.
They'll have to find places on the playing teams to entertain hopes
of further success in the sporting arena.
	   The departure of the crack penalty shooter follows the abolition
of the off-side rule after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, a rule change
that paid off in more goals at this World Cup.
	   This was the first big tournament played under the no off-side
rule. An average of five goals were scored in every game, and the
number of field goals outnumbered those from penalty corners.
	   Spurred by the positive response in boosting spectator support
and commercial sponsorship, the FIH bosses are looking at changing
more rules to make the game less technical and more enjoyable.
	   ``The key is to find the right formula from both a hockey
playing point of view and from a commercial point of view,'' said
FIH President Juan Angel Calzado.
	   Field hockey, once on the list of endangered Olympic
disciplines, has gotten its act together. Getting International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch to back the
sport during the World Cup was a major public relations coup.
	   Now the FIH hopes to change the structure of its competitions to
involve more hockey-playing nations in premier events.
	   ``On the playing side, the FIH wants to encourage greater
participation among lesser-developed countries to develop and
strengthen our sport around the world,'' Calzado said.

Kiriyenko tells French newspaper Russia's crisis is psychological 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said his
country's problems were above all psychological and that a crisis
of confidence was behind the country's deep financial troubles, a
French newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Kiriyenko also said in a lengthy interview with the Le Figaro
daily that Russia would not devalue the ruble and would take
``draconian'' measures to collect taxes.
	   ``I am convinced the greatest problems in Russia are not
economic but psychological,'' said Kiriyenko, who is set to begin a
two-day visit to France on Wednesday.
	   ``Russia is ill. To cure this illness, you can't just fight the
symptoms. You have to attack the causes. Behind the financial
crisis, there is a crisis of confidence,'' Kiriyenko said.
	   Russia's parliament grudgingly confirmed Kiriyenko, 35, in April
and the young prime minister has set redressing the country's
economic woes as his main task.
	   His visit to France will be his first overseas and aims to
persuade French businessmen to invest in Russia. He is also
expected to try to seek support from French political leaders in
the event that Russia needs an IMF bailout.
	   Russia's stock market has fallen 44 percent in the past month,
and the belief is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or other lenders, similar to
those arranged after Asia's financial crisis hit last year.
	   Kiriyenko said, however, that the government had 14 billion
dollars in reserves and would not need to ask for international
aid.
	   He also said that ``there will be no devaluation (of the ruble).
We will maintain the rate of the ruble.''
	   Kiriyenko blamed the current crisis on the fact that the
government for too long had been spending more than it was
collecting in taxes, thus increasing the budget deficit.
	   He said the government would try to hold down spending and
planned to reduce family allocations by assisting only those people
who were really in need.
	   Millions of Russians have been hard hit by economic reforms that
were started under former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
accelerated by Boris Yeltsin after the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
	   Kiriyenko defended Yeltsin in the interview, saying the Russian
president was the country's ``principal support'' and that he was
the ``guarantor of stability'' in Russia.

Lawmaker to grill interior minister on inefficiency charges not just information minister, resigned. 
</HEADLINE>
Ed: CLARIFIES in 4th graf that after last questions whole Cabinet,
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Muslim fundamentalist lawmaker has decided to
grill the interior minister in Parliament over alleged inefficiency
in fighting corruption, drugs and crime, Al-Qabas daily reported
Tuesday.
	   The minister, Sheik Mohammad al-Khaled al-Sabah, has ``horribly
failed'' in fulfilling his responsibilities in two years in office,
legislator Hussein al-Gallaf said in a document presented to the
50-seat house and published by Al-Qabas.
	   No date has been set for the questioning of the minister, a
member of the royal family.
	   Such questioning is unusual in Kuwait. In the last instance
earlier this year, the Cabinet resigned to avoid a non-confidence
motion. Information Minister Sheik Saud al-Sabah, who had been the
subject of the questioning, was then appointed oil minister in a
reshuffle.
	   Al-Gallaf, a Shiite cleric, claimed Sheik Mohammad has failed to
catch ``big fish'' drug traffickers and concentrated on small-time
pushers and users. He said armed robberies have increased and
prostitution has become widespread in this conservative Muslim
society. He offered no statistics to support his argument.
	   The legislator also criticized what he called police ``brutality
and barbarity,'' saying suspects in custody are often tortured.

Conservatives announce plans for fall convention 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Newly allied French conservatives announced plans
Tuesday to hold their first convention in November to define a
political program for the next elections.
	   Modernizing the state, strengthening security and justice and
lowering taxes were among the issues raised by Philippe Seguin, the
provisional president of the Alliance.
	   A new political formation created last month to salvage a right
wing crippled by two humiliating electoral defeats and the rise of
the far right National Front, the Alliance comprises the Rally for
the Republic (RPR), the party of President Jacques Chirac, and the
Union for French Democracy (UDF), a federation of center-right
parties.
	   If the alliance holds, the new movement could change the French
political landscape which until now has been dominated by the RPR,
the UDF and the Socialists and their allies on the left.
	   But defeats in the 1997 legislative and in the 1998 regional
elections, during which some mainstream conservatives accepted
extreme-right votes in order to win, has plunged the right into a
deep crisis.
	   The formation of the Alliance appears to have been at least
partially inspired by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's so-called
``plural left,'' which brings socialists, communists and ecologists
under its banner.

Thai Cabinet approves special economic stimulus package UPDATES baht value with closing figure; EDITS to conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES Cabinet approval of special expenditure;
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
a special expenditure of 50 billion baht (dlrs 1.19 billion) as
part of an effort to stimulate the economy, which went into a
nosedive last year and has yet to recover.
	   The Cabinet instructed government agencies to boost spending by
a total of 40 billion baht (dlrs 952 million), and state
enterprises by 10 billion baht (dlrs 238 million).
	   That would increase the government's total expenditures in
fiscal 1998 to 850 billion baht (20.24 billion), and swell the
budget deficit by one percentage point to 3 percent of the gross
domestic product.
	   A report in the Bangkok Post newspaper said 40 billion baht
(dlrs 952 million), would be drawn from the treasury's reserves of
245 billion baht (dlrs 5.83 billion), and the 10 billion baht (dlr
238 million) for state enterprises would come from borrowing.
	   A large part of the 40 million baht (dlrs 952 million), would be
used to pay overdue compensation to persons whose land had been
expropriated for infrastructure projects, the Post reported.
	   Some money would also go for occupational training for people
who have lost their jobs in the current crisis. Overdue value-added
tax refunds are also expected to be paid out of the money.
	   The economy has begun to stabilize under the administration of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but new declines in the currency and
stock market this week on fears of a deeper recession underscored
how far the country still has to go.
	   Thai stocks rose Tuesday after five straight days of losses,
while a deputy prime minister tried to curb bad inflation news by
predicting price increases would slow in the second half of the
year.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 0.60 points to
313.64, which dealers attributed to selective buying of banking and
finance company stocks that had fallen in recent days.
	   The Thai currency closed at 42.05 to the U.S. dollar, tumbling
from 41.55 Monday on fears of a deeper recession. It was the lowest
level plumbed by the baht in 12 weeks.
	   High interest rates are crippling Thai businesses struggling to
survive the current recession, which the government said last week
will be far deeper and probably longer than previously expected.
	   The International Monetary Fund has demanded that Thailand keep
inflation at an average of 10.5 percent for the year as a condition
of receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package.
	   The Commerce Ministry released data Monday that showed Thai
consumer prices rose 10.2 percent year-on-year in May, the worst
inflation in more than three years. It was the fifth consecutive
month this year that the index has kept rising.

Harpooned whale turns on whaling boat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A harpooned whale in a fight for its life
rammed the boat that shot it, breaking the vessel's mast and
dumping two crewmen into the icy waters.
	   The whale escaped, but it was unclear if it survived its
injuries, the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang reported Tuesday.
	   According to the paper, the Norwegian whaling boat Bolga was off
Norway's northern tip Monday when it harpooned a minke whale, which
can grow to be about nine meters (30 meters) in length.
	   The whale then rammed the 53-foot (16-meter) wooden boat, and
pulled with tremendous force on the rope used to attach the harpoon
to the ship.
	   The impact broke the boat's eight-meter (26-foot) mast, The two
crewmen who had been spotting whales from a crows' next at the top
of the mast plunged into the ocean, about 700 kilometers (425
miles) north of the Arctic Circle.
	   ``I had made it about halfway down the mast when I felt a sudden
jolt. The next thing I knew, I was in the water,'' crewman Benn
Viggo Nilsen, 40, was quoted as telling the newspaper.
	   Nilsen and the other crewman, Bjoern Johansen, were both
rescued. Johansen suffered cracked ribs, while Nilsen was not
injured. The whale escaped, although it was not clear whether it
survived the injuries.
	   The Bolga was so badly damaged that it had to withdraw from this
year's hunt, the report said.
	   Norway has endured frequent protests since resuming its
commercial whaling hunts in 1993, despite a ban imposed by the
International Whaling Commission in 1986.

Eritreans face Ethiopians at disputed border area; reports Sudan bombing Eritrean villages 
</HEADLINE>
By JULIA STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has sent reinforcements to border
areas disputed by Ethiopia, and Eritrean officers insist that
neutral observers could verify that Ethiopian troops occupied
Eritrean territory, a photographer who visited the area said
Tuesday.
	   In Badme, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southwest of Asmara,
Eritrean troops, tanks and artillery face Ethiopian positions on a
ridge, according to the photographer on assignment for The
Associated Press.
	   Since its first public comment on the border dispute May 13,
Ethiopia has repeatedly claimed that Eritreans have made incursions
into Ethiopian territory. Eritrea denies the claims and has
suggested international mediation. Ethiopia rejects direct
negotiations until Eritrea withdraws and threatened to use force if
it did not.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrea is illegally occupying the 400-sq.
km. (160-sq.-mile) Yirga triangle in northwestern Ethiopia as well
as other areas in the northeast.
	   Also Tuesday, an agricultural worker who returned to Asmara from
western Eritrea said Sudan bombed several villages in another part
of Eritrea near Tessenei, 230 kilometers (143 miles) west of
Asmara. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report.
	   Eritrea is hosting the rebel Sudanese National Democratic
Alliance. Unconfirmed reports in the past have indicated the NDA
has attacked Sudan from bases in western Eritrea.
	   Eritrean officers in Badme, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Ethiopians were 16 kilometers (10 miles) inside Eritrea,
according to the boundary drawn by Italian colonizers in the 19th
century. Italy occupied what is now Eritrea from 1885 to 1941. Then
it became a British-administered territory until 1962, when
Ethiopia annexed it.
	   After a 30-year war, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia
in 1993, and according to standards established by the Organization
of African Unity, the border agreed upon was the one drawn by the
Italians.
	   One officer said Eritreans want a neutral party with
colonial-era maps and a Global Positioning System to visit the
border to determine who is where.
	   The photographer said Eritrean reinforcements continued arriving
in the area late Monday.
	   Civilians abandoned Badme and surrounding villages in the Yirga
triangle and moved north after Eritrean forces blocked an Ethiopian
advance last week, the officers said.
	   In Asmara, tarpaulin-covered trucks carrying what appeared to be
artillery pieces headed toward Dekemhare, a military garrison town
about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Asmara.
	   Eritrea has an estimated population of 3.67 million, compared
with about 57 million in Ethiopia.
	   An estimated 100,000 Ethiopians live in Eritrea. An official at
the Ethiopian Embassy in Asmara said Tuesday few of them appeared
to be returning to Ethiopia.
	   President Isias Afwerki said in a nationwide television address
Saturday that the border problem was one between governments and
not people.

EU grants emergency aid for Afghan quake victims

With BC-Afghanistan-Quake
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The EU granted dlrs 1.65 million in aid
Tuesday for victims of the earthquake in northern Afghanistan.
	   The funds will provide basic relief, particularly medical aid,
to tens of thousands of people affected by Saturday's quake, the EU
executive Commission said in a statement.
	   The quake killed at least 3,000 people and left some 45,000
homeless. Up to 80 villages were heavily damaged, a dozen
destroyed.
	   The International Red Cross and the United Nations have sent
aircraft, medical staff, relief items and medicines to the region
which is very difficult to access because of heavy rains and
flooding.
	   Non-governmental organizations, including Doctors Without
Borders, are preparing to send medical teams by road, the
Commission statement said. Last February, 5,000 people died in an
earthquake in Afganistan.
	   Since 1995, the EU has given Afghanistan around dlrs 88.7
million in humanitarian aid.

Sanchez Vicario, Mantilla move into semis 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Muster loss; TRIMS.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aranxta Sanchez Vicario became the first woman in
the semifinals of the French Open Tuesday with a three-set victory
over Patty Schnyder of Switzerland.
	   The former champion, seeded fourth this year, lost a tiebreak in
the second set but coasted through the third for a 6-2, 6-7 (5-7),
6-0 victory.
	   But another former champion, Thomas Muster, continued a
disappointing year with a quarterfinal loss to Felix Mantilla of
Spain, the No. 15 seed, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
	   Muster has seen his ranking drop in the past year from ninth to
22nd.
	   Sanchez Vicario, who won a contentious match against American
Serena Williams in the fourth round, will face either defending
champion Iva Majoli or Lindsay Davenport, who play later Tuesday.
	   But the day's marquee match was between the world's top-seeded
woman, Martina Hingis, and Serena's big sister _ Venus Williams.
	   Williams is playing so well at this year's French Open that the
match between the two young stars is being seen as worthy of the
final.
	   Could there be, finally, a rivalry to match Evert vs.
Navratilova? That's what the tennis world hopes.
	   But Hingis isn't ready to call Venus Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
says. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   ``I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically to Hingis' comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Hingis holds a 5-2 record against Williams, including a 6-0, 6-4
win in the U.S. Open final last summer, their only previous Grand
Slam encounter.
	   They are 2-2 this year. But Hingis won their only career
encounter on clay, the final of the Italian Open in May.
	   ``It was a good victory for me there,'' Hingis said. ``I hope
she will remember that, too.''
	   Statistically speaking, the two have had an almost identical run
through the early rounds here. Hingis has lost just 14 games while
averaging 56 minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and
averaged 58 minutes per match.
	   But stylistically speaking, they are totally different.
	   Hingis has a masterful touch, moving opponents around the court
with precise groundstrokes. Williams is pure power.
	   Marat Safin, an 18-year-old qualifier, used his power to carve
his way through the first three rounds. His tournament ended on
Monday, however, in five tough sets.
	   The French fans chanted wildly for his opponent, Frenchman
Cedric Pioline. ``Allez Cedric!'' they yelled.
	   But as the match wore on, there were growing chants of ``Ma-RAT!
Ma-RAT!''
	   It was in tribute to the remarkable run by the young Russian
playing his first Grand Slam event. He began the tournament ranked
116th in the world, but won't be there much longer.
	   ``I think I can beat good players now,'' he said after Pioline
ended his run 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Safin's tournament started with three qualifying matches just to
get into the main draw.
	   Next up was Andre Agassi, in the midst of a strong comeback.
Safin, however, had the answer to every problem Agassi presented.
Then he ousted defending champion Gustavo Kuerten, ranked eighth in
the world, in another five-setter.
	   In the third round, Safin had a slightly easier time _ needing
only four sets to beat Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   That set up the match with Pioline. The 28-year-old Frenchman is
erratic, but brilliant on occasion. He has reached the finals of
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, both times losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Pioline has a reputation for choking at the end of matches.
Although he has reached 12 singles finals in his career, he has
captured only two titles.
	   Safin knew nothing of that.
	   ``Nobody told me,'' he said.
	   It didn't matter. This time it was Safin who unraveled. Pioline
broke the Russian's serve three times, including once in the fifth
set. That was enough.
	   Safin said he wasn't thrown off his game by the 16,000 fans at
Roland Garros shouting for Pioline. However, the presence of soccer
star Ronaldo in the VIP box was another matter.
	   ``I'd never seen Ronaldo so close up before,'' he explained.

Danish international signs four-year contract with AC Milan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Danish international midfielder Thomas
Helveg has signed a four-year contract with AC Milan, the
powerhouse owned by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi announced
Tuesday.
	   The 26-year-old Dane joins some known faces at Milan - German
striker Oliver Bierhoff and coach Alberto Zaccheroni, who were with
him at Udinese until last season.
	   The Italian coach and Bierhoff signed with the Milan club last
month.
	   Team officials said Helveg's contract will last through June 30,
2002. Terms were not disclosed.
	   However, soccer circles suggested Milan paid Udinese a transfer
fee of about 15 billion lire (dlrs 8.3 million) for Helveg.
	   The Dane had been playing with Udinese since 1993.
	   Milan is through a major reshuffle of players and technicians
for the 1998-99 soccer season after two consecutive disappointing
years.

U.S., China discuss upcoming summit 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment by President Jiang Zemin; EDITS to trim.
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's top national
security aide held talks with Chinese leaders Tuesday on Clinton's
planned Beijing summit with President Jiang Zemin late this month.
	   Clinton plans to visit China despite growing criticisms in
Congress that could hinder his ability to reach agreements with
Chinese leaders.
	   U.S. Embassy officials said National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger was here to prepare for the summit, but refused to discuss
specifics. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the meetings
covered Clinton's itinerary and international issues, but also
declined to give details.
	   Berger met with President Jiang, who said he was looking forward
to meeting Clinton in Beijing, state news media reported.
	   ``His visit to China will undoubtedly promote the bilateral
relationship in a sound and stable direction,'' Jiang said,
according to the Xinhua News Agency.
	   Berger also met with Vice Premier Qian Qichen, Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan, and Liu Huaqiu, the security issues expert for
China's State Council, or Cabinet.
	   U.S. and Chinese officials have been shuttling across the
Pacific to arrange Clinton's China trip, the first by a U.S.
president in nine years. Despite the high-level diplomacy,
differences on trade, Taiwan, human rights and Tibet remain to be
bridged.
	   Chinese leaders, who are keen to use summit pageantry to boost
domestic support, also want Clinton to make a strong statement
limiting U.S. support for Taiwan.
	   U.S. officials say a deal on China's entry to the World Trade
Organization is unlikely, barring last-minute market-opening
concessions.
	   The atmosphere for witnessing big money business contract
signing may be spoiled by congressional inquiries questioning
Clinton's dealings with China. The investigations are looking into
alleged Chinese donations to Clinton's Democrats and whether U.S.
satellite deals he approved helped China upgrade its ballistic
missiles.
	   Trent Lott, leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said
Monday in Washington that the controversies put in jeopardy the
annual extension of China's low-tariff trade status.
	   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said the president will make a
strong defense for continuing the most-favored-nation trade status
by Wednesday's deadline.
	   Zhu, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Washington's
annual review of low-tariff trade terms for China was an ``outmoded
practice'' that was ``not conducive to smooth trade relations.''
Beijing hopes Washington makes most-favored-nation trade status
permanent as soon as possible, he said.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP Simpler look returns due to fashion trends, FIFA order 
</HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If the uniforms of the teams at the World Cup seem
a little simpler in France this time, it's not just by design _
it's by FIFA fiat.
	   Weary of the mixtures of stripes and swirls, the blending of
reds and greens and blues, FIFA has told the Gianni Versaces of the
sporting goods industry: enough!
	   ``We really cracked down on the shirts this time, and the shorts
as well,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``We made it clear we
wanted one dominant color, unless there was a blue-and-white stripe
like Argentina.
	   ``We really tightened up on the manufacturers: what they could
do with their (logo); the number on the back, that had become a
part of the design element. We were in danger of the uniform losing
its original function.''
	   With the way Adidas, Kappa, Nike, Diadora, Puma, Reebok, Umbro,
Hummel and various smaller companies had been designing their
shirts, FIFA and some traditionalists were bemoaning the ability to
identify one team from another.
	   Some companies used one standard kit design, and then filled it
in with the team or country's colors. That was fine unless two
countries with the same colors played against one another.
	   The other option was to create a design unique to the particular
country, that's where at times the shirts looked like they were put
in a blender.
	   Even the goalkeeper's uniforms had gotten into the act, with
one, as Cooper described it, ``looked like he had gotten sick all
down the front of it _ and the back, don't know how he quite
managed that.''
	   But the simplification probably would've happened without FIFA's
intervention anyway, the result of fashion trends _ just not as
quickly.
	   ``It has absolutely slowed down. Heavy graphics have been
shunned,'' said Tom Kain director of marketing for Nike. ``It's
back to building garments for the athletes. It's getting back to
basics.
	   ``That's a reflection of demand from the athletes and the
consumers.''
	   FIFA wanted the shirts to be 80 percent of one color, Cooper
said, but then relented somewhat realizing that it had no way to
exactly determine between 79 and 80 percent. So it decided on a
subjective judgment by FIFA staff.
	   Other problems included the stylizing of the numbers on the
jerseys and shorts, or stripes and other designs running through
the numbers to make them unreadable.
	   For example, on the recently retired U.S. jerseys, the broad
stripes that ringed the shirt horizontally made it difficult to
identify the numbers.
	   On some jerseys, FIFA made the teams/manufacturers block out a
place for the numbers, and made them meet the 30 centimeter
(12-inch) size requirement
	   ``I think you're beginning to see what you will see, a much
cleaner, more respectful look,'' said Peter Moore, senior vice
president of global soccer for Reebok. ``You're seeing a jersey
worn more for the nation rather than the manufacturer.
	   ``In most cases, the flag colors are in the jersey. So we're
trying to pay homage while still doing some design work to give it
distinction.''
	   But even with the new regulations, manufacturers will take some
license. Considering the dlrs 200 million Nike reportedly paid for
its deal with Brazil and the other dlrs 120 million it paid for its
association with the U.S. Soccer Federation, it still has some say.
	   The input is considerable when your realize that Adidas is
anticipating dlrs 600 million in apparel sales from France '98,
although not all in replica team jerseys.
	   Yet, they know where they can play, and where they can't.
	   ``Paraguay certainly has a well-known red-and-white stripes with
blue shorts,'' Moore said. ``I'm not going to play with that.
	   ``Where we will try to do something is we the away strip. And
the third strip, which would gives you three options. That's where
we take certain amount of license. Almost certainly, with the away
kit, almost anything goes.
	   ``For 30 years England played with red away. But they played in
gray (Umbro officially called it indigo blue) in '94 and '96.''
	   The trick, according to Moore, is for a manufacturer to keep the
basic elements of a team uniform the same, while at the same time
identifying it with their brand.
	   Working in Nike's ``swoosh'', Reebok's ``vector'', or Adidas'
three stripes without being obnoxious is the new challenge.
	   Working design elements with shadow striping, or the fabric's
``jacquard'', is one way. ABA Sport uses the method heavily in
incorporating Aztec symbols in the Mexico jersey.
	   Among them, five manufacturers will make the shirts for 23 of
the 32 World Cup teams: Puma, Umbro, Reebok, Nike and Adidas, with
the latter two accounting for 13 different teams.
	   And they almost all are introducing their latest and greatest
technical improvements, a fabric Nike calls ``Dri-Fit''; Umbro
calls it ``Vapor-tech.''
	   Some manufacturers are easily identifiable by their standard
design. Puma's shirts for Austria, Cameroon and Bulgaria are
noticeable by the standard one color with side panels in a
different color.
	   Conversely Umbro, went out of its way to create distinct designs
for its three teams: England, Scotland and Norway.
	   For teams like the United States, Jamaica, South Africa or
Bulgaria, sides without traditional looks, the urge to tinker will
always be in the designer.
	   But for others, there will always be the comfort of knowing
Italy's Azzurri will always trot out in their familiar all blue,
England in its white, or the Dutch in their orange.
	   ``Some teams are very good about that,'' Cooper said.

Palestinians want Arab summit regardless of Israeli answer to U.S. proposal 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinians will ask the Arab world to
convene a summit whether or not Israel accepts the U.S. proposal
for a West Bank redeployment, a top adviser to Yasser Arafat said
Tuesday.
	   Arafat has called for an Arab summit to form a unified Arab
strategy to ``confront Israeli arrogance,'' which he blames for the
deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
	   The Americans have been pressing Israel to accept a proposal for
a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank. The Palestinians have
already accepted the U.S. proposal. Nabil Abourdeineh said Tuesday
that he expects the U.S. ideas to be made public ``in the coming
four or five days,'' and that a decision on whether to hold a
summit would be made at the same time.
	   The Palestinians have been trying to convene the summit since
early this year, but the idea has gained momentum in the past two
weeks. Despite a recent flurry of meetings in Arab capitals,
however, no final decision has been reached.
	   Syria insists the summit put the brakes on normalization of Arab
ties with Israel, while Jordan, Israel's closest Arab ally, has
apparently balked at that.
	   Abourdeineh did not say why the summit would be needed if
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted the U.S.
proposal, although there has been no indication he would do so.
	   Negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis have been
frozen since March 1997, when Israel broke ground on a settlement
project in the eastern part of Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim
as their future capital.
	   Israeli officials charged that the Palestinians' call for an
Arab summit violated the peace agreements.

Milosevic silent over Montenegro elections 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Stands for Podorica-dated story offered in AP news digest.
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic remained conspicuously silent Tuesday over a major
parliamentary election triumph by his foes in Montenegro who
pledged to defy him and push for more democracy.
	   Milosevic's reaction to the election victory of a coalition led
by reform-minded Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic could
determine whether Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and small
Montenegro, breaks up or moves toward democratic changes.
	   Milosevic's ally Momir Bulatovic, who lost the elections, was
summoned to Belgrade for urgent consultations with the hard-liner.
There was no word from the meeting.
	   Sunday's elections will hand Djukanovic a majority in the
78-seat Montenegrin parliament. Djukanovic and his aides are
determined to stack Montenegro's bloc with their supporters, and
hope to team up with the Serbian opposition to either unseat
Milosevic or at least weaken his rule.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, Milosevic has
used an effective mix of nationalism, media control and autocratic
methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic's presidential victory last October, coupled with
Sunday's parliamentary victory, seriously weakened Milosevic's grip
on the Yugoslav federation.
	   Djukanovic said in an interview with the independent Belgrade
Radio Index Tuesday that Milosevic ``will have to accept the new
Montenegrin political reality.''
	   He accused Milosevic of destroying Yugoslavia with his
``arrogant obstinacy'' and said Milosevic ``will have to take the
blame for the collapse of the country which he is running'' if he
continues attempts to subjugate Montenego.
	   Djukanovic first challenged the Yugoslav power-broker in the
winter of 1996-1997, coming out against Milosevic during massive
protests against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin narrowly beat Bulatovic _ his former
best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office in January.
	   Djukanovic said in the radio interview that he would insist on
Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic maneuvered
his protege into that office two weeks ago after the previous
premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western reforms.
	   Djukanovic's aides have suggested that he would seek holding a
referendum in Montenegro on the republic's secession from
Yugoslavia if Milosevic doesn't replace Bulatovic.

Eds: UPDATES with Abdel-Meguid saying full summit not expected;
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah held
further talks Tuesday on a proposed Arab summit as Jordan resisted
any move that would have the meeting urge cutting off all ties with
Israel.
	   The meeting came as differences persisted over whether to hold
the summit in Syria or Egypt and over how strong a message the
summit should send to Israel about the breakdown of Middle East
peace talks.
	   In Lebanon, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
told the leftist daily As-Safir that he did not expect a full Arab
summit now. He said discussions now focused on a meeting of
confrontation states _ those around Israel _ plus Saudi Arabia and
Morocco.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged a summit to clearly
blame Israel for the negotiations stalemate. Israel-Palestinian
talks have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building
a Jewish housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Abdullah met Tuesday with Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother
and heir, following overnight talks with the Jordanian monarch on
the site and the agenda of the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal met with Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani.
	   After the 90-minute session, Anani said that Jordan prefers the
summit be held in the headquarters of the 22-member Arab League in
Cairo, Egypt. ``The context is the most important to us,'' he told
reporters.
	   Syria wants the summit held in its capital, Damascus, where the
government of President Hafez Assad could exert more pressure for a
strong stance against Israel.
	   Underlining disagreements with Syria on the agenda of the
meeting, Anani said more Arab consultations were needed before the
convening of the summit.
	   ``A summit is not something that falls out of a tree ... a
summit must be well prepared,'' he said. ``We don't want to look to
the rest of the world that we are just meeting there to disagree or
meeting there just to exchange blames.''
	   Syria wants the proposed summit to put the brakes on Arabs'
normalization of ties with Israel. At their last summit in 1966,
the Arabs warned of such a step if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu did not keep pledges made in peace talks with
Palestinians.
	   Jordan, the strongest advocate of peace with Israel, is worried
that a hard-line stance could lead to Arab pressures and ultimately
jeopardize close trade and political ties developed since the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   ``There is concern that Jordan and other countries at peace with
Israel might be cornered at the summit,'' said a Jordanian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He told The Associated Press that Jordan wants the summit to
support the Palestinians and the peace process and ``focus on
Israel's stubborn policy rather than giving Israel more excuses to
distance itself from peace.''
	   Crown Prince Abdullah met with Assad in Damascus before coming
to Jordan. He was scheduled to return home later Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the visiting U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, said after meeting Anani that
the proposed summit should deal with the peace process with ``a
great deal of care and sensitivity.''

	   The government has decided to increase the number of projects to
be implemented by union parishads along with an increase in project
money. The fund allocation to each UP chairman will be raised to Tk
2 lakh for eight projects a year from the present Tk 50,000 for
five projects.
	   This was announced by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday.
	   She warned that corruption in implementation of projects would
not be tolerated.
	   She was speaking as the chief guest at the conference of union
parishad chairmen and members of Dhaka division at the
Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Export Trade Fair ground. LGRD and Cooperatives
Minister Zillur Rahman and State Minister for LGRD and Cooperatives
Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya Bir Bikram were the special guests.
Secretary of the Local Government Division AHM Abdul Hye presented
the address of welcome.
	   The Prime Minister said the government would amend the law to
increase the sources of income of the union parishads from 7 to 15.
She said the government would consider giving union parishad
chairmen grants in phases. The government would also consider
giving soft loans to the UP chairmen.
	   Sheikh Hasina urged the chairmen and members of the union
parishads to play a significant role in eliminating poverty,
spreading education and ensuring health care to the rural people.
	   Sheikh Hasina asked the UP chairmen and members to play an
effective role in checking terrorism and curbing torture of women
and children. She asked them to stop social vices strictly. She
said the government had taken measures to train UP chairmen and
members with the assistance of the UNDP for improving their
leadership quality and efficiency. She said the overall development
of villages and improvement of rural infrastructure was the aim of
the government.
	   The Prime Minister said the government had taken steps to
provide special loans to the rural unemployed youths. The present
paid-up capital of Tk 50 crore of the employment bank would be
increased to Tk 300 crore in phases. The government had taken up
the Tk 360 crore Ideal village project and set up a housing fund
with Tk 50 crore capital.
	   Sheikh Hasina said construction of more than 700 feeder roads
was now being implemented. Link roads would be constructed in every
union.
	   The Prime Minister said the last union parishad election was the
most peaceful in the last two decades. She mentioned that this time
the women members were elected directly for the first time. She
described this as a revolution in social life. She said social
development was not possible ignoring the development of women.
	   Sheikh Hasina said the government would provide welfare
allowance to teachers and employees of registered primary schools.
The government had granted Tk 31,4000,000 for the non-government
primary school teachers this year. She said 27 projects for poverty
alleviation at a cost of Tk 156 crore were being implemented in the
present ADP.
	   She said the government had taken steps to strengthen the local
government following the recommendations of the local government
commission formed by her government. The Prime Minister said the
Upazila Parishad Act would be passed in the next session of the
Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila Parishad elections would be held soon
after that.
	   Zillur Rahman said the process of strengthening the local
government and decentralisation of power would continue. He said
the power of the union parishads to lease hats had been raised to
Tk one lakh from Tk 50,000 to make the union parishads
self-reliant.
	   Thousands of union parishad chairmen and members of Dhaka
division, including a large number of women, gathered under the
huge pandal at the conference venue at the sprawling Export Trade
Fair Ground at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.
	   Chairman of Goran union parishad in Tangail district Mir Enayet
Hossain Montu spoke on behalf of the UP chairmen and UP member
Sajeda Begum of Ramdi UP in Kishoreganj district spoke on behalf of
the women UP members. Chairman of Boalia UP in Rajbari district
Begum Shahida Rahman presented the Prime minister with a crest.
	   The office of the Civil surgeon of Dhaka arranged two medical
aid camps at the conference venue. About 130 persons who were
affected by the excessive heat were given treatment at the camps.
About 30 persons were sent to different hospitals, according to
camp sources.

Yeltsin reasserts his opposition to trophy art bill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin reiterated Tuesday his
opposition to a bill that would prevent artwork looted by the
Soviet army at the end of World War II from leaving Russia.
	   Yeltsin vetoed the bill last year, but was overridden by both
houses of parliament. He signed the bill in April, but immediately
asked the country's highest court to determine its
constitutionality.
	   On Tuesday, he reasserted his opposition to the law at a meeting
with Constitutional Court chairman Marat Baglai. Yeltsin says the
law will backfire on Russia, making it more difficult to get its
own stolen treasures back.
	   ``They have taken more things out of Russia and we need to
return them,'' Yeltsin said during the meeting, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   At stake are an estimated 1 million books, 55,000 paintings,
sculptures and other art works, and 175,000 coins and medals now in
Russian state museums.
	   Germany and other countries have long demanded the art back, and
Yeltsin wants a free hand in negotiating their return.
	   Russian lawmakers fiercely oppose returning any of the art _ a
feeling shared by many Russians who see it as a rightful
compensation for the huge human, material and cultural losses
inflicted by the Nazis.
	   Yeltsin argues that the trophy art law violates Russia's
constitution and international obligations, and does not
differentiate between art seized by the Soviet army and that seized
by the Nazis.
	   No date for a court hearing has been set.

Japanese Cabinet holds special meeting on jobless problem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister ordered his Cabinet at a
special meeting Tuesday to speed up government public works
spending to cut the country's record high jobless rate, news
reports said.
	   The meeting of top policy makers came after the government
announced Friday that the jobless rate hit 4.1 percent in April _
the highest level since the government started measuring it in
1953.
	   Tuesday's was the first special Cabinet meeting on the economy
in two years.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto instructed Cabinet ministers to
speed up disbursement of government spending in regions hit hardest
by mounting unemployment levels, the reports said.
	   The Cabinet agreed to hasten public works project expenditure in
areas around Tokyo and Osaka, along with Japan's northernmost main
island of Hokkaido and southernmost main island of Kyushu, Kyodo
News reported.
	   It also decided to expand public financing of jobs projects at

institutions, national broadcaster NHK said.
	   In April, the Cabinet adopted a public works-heavy 16.7 trillion
yen (dlrs 119.9 billion) plan aimed at reviving the ailing Japanese
economy.

	   BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan yesterday said that
the state of Human Rights in the country would not be improved
until the Awami League government was toppled.
	   ``There are two ways to unseat the Awami League government; the
first is to wait for three years for the next elections and the
other is to overthrow the government through a mass upsurge,'' the
BNP Secretary General said while addressing a seminar on ``The
Current Status of Human Rights in Bangladesh'' at the Jatiya Press
Club in the city yesterday.
	   He said, ``The country is already in a vulnerable state, and if
we have to wait for three years for next elections the country will
be utterly ruined''.
	   Organised by Human Rights Watch Bangladesh, the seminar was
presided over by Chairman of the organisation, AM Badruzzaman
Khasru and also addressed by former Vice Chancellor of Dhaka
University, Professor Moniruzzaman Mia, Opposition MP, Amir Khasru
Mahmood, President of the Rotary Club of Dhaka Cosmopolitan, Ameer
Khashru Mahmud Chowdhury, Ruhul Kabir Rijvi, journalists Nurul
Islam Bhuiyan and Amir Khashru, an Associate Professor of Political
Science of Dhaka University Dr. Tasmim Siddiqui and Mahfuz Parvez.
	   The BNP Secretary said that the government had even curtailed
the inherent rights of the citizens of the country, especially of
those who were critical of the government.
	   He also said that the governments were the main violators of
human rights different countries in the world for ages.
	   Being critical about the neutrality of the Speaker, the BNP
Secretary General said: ``Despite political affiliation, it is
natural that the Speaker should be neutral. But unfortunately this
Speaker is highly biased towards his political party''.
	   Professor Moniruzzaman Mia said that though it was the
constitutional rights to hold meetings and bring out procession,
the Opposition was not allowed to do so under this Awami League
government.
	   ``The people are living with a fear that they will be sued
whenever they will criticise the government,'' the former Vice
Chancellor said.
	   He alleged that the law and order situation had deteriorated
since the people affiliated with the ruling party had been indulged
to gain something out of their positions. ``It seems that they are
very hungry for not being in power for the last 21 years,'' he
said.

  THE TOURNAMENT:
	   LONDON _ Hooliganism, terrorism, a ticket sales furor and even
strikes all threaten to turn the World Cup finals into chaos. But
one thing appears certain. If veteran coach Mario Zagallo gets the
blend just right, defending champion Brazil will rise above it all
and walk away with its fifth title.

badly needed glory in the fading millennium, and the French are
sparing no effort to wrap the games in grandeur. ``The World Cup

	   THE government yesterday appeared to hammer a huge nail in the
coffin of the Urban and Regional councils, proposing that they be
stripped of important powers over food safety and environmental
hygiene and listing restructuring options that could result in
their abolition.
	   A consultation paper on the future role of the two bodies and
the district boards proposes that the government should take over
responsibility for food safety and environmental hygiene, amid
concern over recent health scares.
	   It also proposes new finance arrangements for the councils'
remaining functions of arts, culture, sport and recreation aimed at
more public accountability and better value for money.
	   But it further proposes four restructuring options for the
thus-weakened councils including one _ which the government appears
to favour _ that would dissolve the two bodies altogether.
	   The options are: Merging the two councils but leaving the 18
district boards intact.
	   Dissolving the two councils and transferring their functions to
the government and statutory bodies.
	   Merging the two councils and all district boards to form a small
number of regional bodies, or Retaining the two councils and the 18
district boards but improving co-ordination of the municipal
councils.
	   Listing the pros and cons, the paper gives a positive assessment
only of the second, saying it will enhance Legislative Council
scrutiny of public spending and ensure greater accountability.
	   The consultation paper says that amalgamating the two councils
would not resolve the problem of discrepancies in polices and
practices, co-ordination and fragmented responsibilities and the
overlap between a combined council and the district boards.
	   On a merger of the two councils and all district boards to form
several regional bodies the paper says that some functions such as
planning and management of major or territory-wide facilities could
be discharged more cost-effectively at the central level by
relevant departments or statutory bodies.
	   To decentralise these functions might result in fragmented
responsibilities and diminished efficiency.
	   This option would be administratively complex and probably lead
to wider diversity in implementation practices and difficulties in
co-ordination.
	   On retaining the status quo, the paper says that it is doubtful
whether current problems could be satisfactorily resolved if the
structure remained intact. ``It appears that unless changes are
introduced, the problems cannot be resolved,'' the paper says.
	   However, on the proposal to abolish the two councils the paper
is upbeat on its advantages: inclusion of representatives from the
arts and sports fields along with community leaders and experts in
statutory bodies; public accountability on funding; legislature and
district boards oversight; cost-effectiveness; additional resources
for district boards along with enhanced role in provision of
facilities at local level.
	   However, Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen
Ming-yeung repeatedly stressed that the government had no
preferences among these options.
	   The consultation exercise will close next month and Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa is expected to announce the government's
decision in his policy address in October. This would allow time
for for next year's elections of the two municipal councils and
district boards.
	   However, Democratic Party member Fred Li Wah-ming who is on the
Provisional Urban Council, said the government's intentions were
obvious.

Thai Cabinet approves special economic stimulus package substituting for earlier newspaper report in grafs 5-7; DELETES old material about inflation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with government explanation of where money will go,
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
50 billion baht (dlrs 1.19 billion) in special spending as part of
a plan to stimulate the economy, which went into a nosedive last
year and has yet to recover.
	   The Cabinet instructed government agencies to boost spending by
a total of 40 billion baht (dlrs 952 million), and state
enterprises by 10 billion baht (dlrs 238 million).
	   That would increase the government's total expenditures in
fiscal 1998 to 850 billion baht (20.24 billion), and swell the
budget deficit by one percentage point to 3 percent of the gross
domestic product.
	   A report in the Bangkok Post newspaper said 40 billion baht
(dlrs 952 million), would be drawn from the treasury's reserves of
245 billion baht (dlrs 5.83 billion), and the 10 billion baht (dlrs
238 million) for state enterprises would come from borrowing.
	   Of the 50 billion baht (dlrs 1.19 billion) spending increase,
more than half will finance government programs aimed at creating
jobs, the government announced.
	   Government agencies will increase their investment budgets by 27
billion baht (dlrs 642.9 million) to pay for projects that create
jobs by providing social services. The projects must be short-term
because the Thai fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
	   The government also will pump an additional 13 billion baht
(dlrs 309.5 million) into the economy by making a big contribution
to the country's Social Security Fund, helping to repay the debts
of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority and assisting government
employees with their hospital bills.
	   Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said the government
would make a 4.75 billion baht (dlrs 113.1 million) contribution to
the Social Security Fund on condition that the fund deposits the
money with Thai commercial banks and finance companies.
	   That move is aimed at shoring up the cash supply of Thai
financial institutions, which have stopped making fresh loans
because of a cash crunch.
	   The economy has begun to stabilize under the administration of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, but new declines in the currency and
stock market this week on fears of a deeper recession underscored
how far the country still has to go.
	   Thai stocks rose Tuesday after five straight days of losses,
with the Stock Exchange of Thailand index gaining 0.60 points to
313.64. Dealers attributed the rise to selective buying of banking
and finance company stocks that had fallen in recent days.
	   The Thai currency closed at 42.05 to the U.S. dollar, tumbling
from 41.55 Monday on fears of a deeper recession. It was the lowest
level plumbed by the baht in 12 weeks.

	   The elections of the Dhaka University Central Students Union
(DUCSU) have become uncertain as the leaders of the Awami League
backed Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra
Dal (JCD) leaders were at variance with each other over holding of
fresh polls.
	   The leaders of the BNP backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) and
the Bangladesh Chhatra Union have already demanded that a congenial
atmosphere should be restored on the campus before to holding the
DUCSU polls. The JCD leaders have also threatened to resist any
attempt to hold polls unless the DU authorities arrest the armed
BCL (S-P) members from the campus and rehabilitate the JCD members
in their halls.
	   The criteria for participating in the polls have also created
mixed reaction among the leaders of different student organisations
including the BCL (S-P).
	   According to the Syndicate's decision, only the regular students
of the university will be able to compete for the executive
committee posts of the DUCSU. According to the university rule,
students completing their honours courses within five academic year
and Masters courses within three academic years will be treated as
regular students. But those who take more academic years would not
be treated as regular students.
	   The Diploma students of the Institute of Education and Research
(IER) and the Mphil and PhD students of the university would not be
allowed to compete in the DUCSU polls, according to a DU rule
regarding DUCSU polls. They can, however, cast their votes in
favour of their candidates.
	   BCL (S-P) leader Shujit Roy Nondi who is an Mphil student of the
Marketing Department and willing to compete for a DUCSU post, said
that the provision to restrict the Mphil students from competing in
the polls was a discriminatory one.
	   ``We shall stage a movement against this discriminatory rule,''
he added.
	   The regular students and the emerging leaders of different
student organisations were, however, much enthusiastic about the
DUCSU polls, sources said.
	   The leaders, who were the irregular students of the university,
however, were not in favour of the DUCSU polls, sources said.
Though they are willing to compete for DUCSU posts, the university
regulations are barring them from doing it, according to sources.
	   The Vice-Chancellor, Prof Abul Kalam Azad Chowdhury said that
the DUCSU polls might be held in October or November this year. The
DU authorities would call the leaders of different student
organisations to fix up the schedules for the polls after the
summer vacation, he added.
	   ``We are trying to improve the situation in the university,''
said Prof Abul Kalam Azad Chowdhury when asked about JCD's demand
for restoring congenial atmosphere prior to holding of the DUCSU
polls.
	   Earlier, the Dhaka University Syndicate in a meeting on
Wednesday approved a new constitution for the DUCSU and dissolved
it's eight years old committee which was elected in June, 1990.
	   It may be recalled that the DU authorities had taken initiatives
to hold DUCSU polls on four occasions after the 1990's polls. Those
attempts were frustrated as a result of opposition from different
student organisations.
	   Earlier, initiatives were taken in 1991, 1993 and 1994 to hold
the DUCSU polls. All those attempts ended in failure, following
opposition from the BCL (S-P). Prof Abul Kalam Azad Chowdhury had
also earlier taken initiatives to hold the DUCSU polls but his
attempts failed due to opposition from the JCD. All the opposing
student organisations demanded that congenial atmosphere should be
restored on the DU campus prior to holding of the polls.

Civil servants' pay rise likely to be the lowest in 12 years, HONGKONG STANDARD

	   CIVIL servants are expected to get between 4 and 5 per cent in
pay rises this year _ the lowest for 12 years.
	   The Executive Council will discuss the pay rise during its
regular meeting this morning before formally unveiling it to civil
service union representatives in the afternoon.
	   Almost two weeks ago, civil service unions proposed a 6 per cent
across-the-board rise for all levels.
	   It is believed that the Executive Council will only be
considering an increase of between 4 and 5 per cent in civil
servants' salary because of the economic downturn.
	   ``The people should not expect too much because our economic
performance is quite bad,'' the source said.
	   ``We might even face negative growth for the whole year,'' he
added.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen announced on
Friday that the economy had shrunk by 2 per cent for the first time
in 13 years.
	   The government appears reluctant to grant a higher pay rise to
the 190,000-strong civil service because of its effect on the
budget.
	   There had been scepticism over whether the government could meet
the $10 billion surplus for the 1998-99 budget because of the
economic downturn.
	   Philip Kwok Chi-tak, the representative of the Senior Civil
Service Council at the Pay Trend Survey Committee, said the unions
would be very disappointed if the government granted only a 4 to 5
per cent pay rise.
	   ``We will try to come up with a counter proposal if the
government rejects our original demand of a 6 per cent pay rise,''
he said.
	   Mr Kwok said the counter proposal would depend on the
government's offer and also on the views of other unions.
	   ``It has to be a collective decision, it is not only our
association that will decide,'' he said.
	   Vice-president of the Chinese Civil Servants' Association Peter
Wong Hyo said the civil servants' proposal was very reasonable.
	   ``I think civil servants have the right to ask for a pay rise
that will help them with inflation,'' he said.
	   ``That is not too much for us.'' Mr Wong said that his
association would not consider staging industrial action, similar
to that staged by government doctors_ even if they were
disappointed with the pay rise.
	   ``I will only support industrial action if the government makes
drastic reductions in our pay scale and abolishes certain
benefits,'' he said.
	   A survey conducted by the Pay Trend Survey Committee recommended
a 5.01 to 6.03 per cent increase in civil servants' salaries
compared with 6.81 to 6.9 per cent last year.

Australians raise doubts about two Papua New Guinea airlines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Airline authorities said Tuesday they
are prepared to prevent two regional airlines from flying into
Australia unless they fix potential safety problems quickly.
	   Transport Minister Mark Vaile said Papua New Guinea's national
carrier Air Niugini and Milne Bay Airlines Pty. Ltd. have both
already been warned of the possible ban.
	   Vaile said a joint team of Australian and Papua New Guinea
authorities had recently conducted a safety audit of both airlines.
He said ``deficiencies'' had been identified and there had been an
apparent lack of progress in addressing them.
	   ``The Australian government views the issues raised as extremely
serious,'' Vaile said.
	   ``A number of deadlines for these airlines to remedy important
safety issues have passed without any action from (Papua New
Guinea's) Office of Civil Aviation,'' Vaile said.
	   Vaile did not say what these safety issues are, and his
spokesman, Peter Cassuben, said these would not be made public at
this stage.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is willing to visit New Delhi and
Islamabad at the earliest opportunity to meet her counterparts
there to discuss the situation arising out of the nuclear tests.
	   In separate letters to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Newaz Sharif, the Bangladesh
leader said ''personally I would be happy to visit your great
country at an early date to discuss the situation arising out of
nuclear tests and all issues of mutual concern.''
	   High Commissioners of India and Pakistan were separately called
in the foreign office yesterday afternoon and handed over the
letters. Sheikh Hasina was replying to the letters which had been
addressed to her by the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in
which they explained their respective positions with regard to
nuclear tests, sources at the foreign office said.
	   Vajpayee's letter was received on May 16, while the letter of
Sharif's was delivered on May 20.
	   Sheikh Hasina in her ''more or less identical replies'' stressed
that the imperative and priority for the countries of the region
were development and cooperation among themselves so as to ensure a
better quality of life and standard of living for the peoples of
South Asia,'' sources added.
	   The Bangladesh Prime Minister pointed out that an arms race
involving nuclear weapons and missile technology would be
detrimental to these objectives and also affect the atmosphere of
cooperation and friendship, she said ''our main concern nationally,
at this point of time, is to combat the pervasive problems of
poverty, under development, disease, hunger and environmental
degradation''.
	   In this context, Sheikh Hasina referred to the successive SAARC
meetings and in particular to the recent Bangladesh-India-Pakistan
tripartite summit in Dhaka where there was clear expression of
political will for greater cooperation and friendship for
development in South Asia.
	   While admitting that every country will decide its own security
perceptions and take measures accordingly, the Prime Minister
expressed her view that ''nuclear weapons did not enhance a
country's security in the post-cold war and, indeed, could diminish
it''. There was a great realisation the world over of the need for
nuclear disarmament, the reply said.
	   Sheikh Hasina expressed the confidence that all differences and
problems could be resolved through dialogue and discussion.

Last Aussies to leave Kuwait soon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The government announced Tuesday that
it will soon withdraw the last of the Australian forces still in
Kuwait, sent in case a U.S.-led coalition decided to attack Iraq.
	   Defense Minister Ian McLachlan, who made the announcement, said
the decision follows the U.S. decision to reduce its forces in the
gulf to roughly pre-crisis levels.
	   Australia sent a contingent of 190 defense personnel to the gulf
in February as part of coalition forces intended to persuade Iraq
to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to do their work.
	   But most of the Australian forces were withdrawn in May, leaving
just one special air services troop of about 30 commandos.
	   However, McLachlan said Australia is still concerned about the
situation in Iraq.
	   ``We are still concerned about Iraq's pursuit of chemical and
biological weapons,'' he said.
	   McLachlan said Australian forces would be able to return to the
Gulf on short notice, if necessary.
	   ``We must keep pressure on Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass
destruction,'' he said.

	   THE plunge in property prices has wiped out an estimated $1.355
trillion in wealth held by private-flat owners.
	   A report released yesterday by Hang Seng Bank warned the
property crisis will have a more serious impact than the 1982-1984
crisis when prices tumbled about 40 per cent.
	   ``The wealth effect on consumer spending, the severity of credit
contraction and the reduction on property-related activities should
be more substantial,'' the Hang Seng Economic Monthly said.
	   The report said a swift recovery for the market ``remains
difficult to envisage''.
	   It said one major difference between the current downturn and
the one in the early 1980s was the growing perception that there
had been a fundamental change in the government's land and housing
policies.
	   The report views the government's desire to meet strong housing
demand through various supply-side measures _ such as its target of
building 85,000 flats a year _ as making it difficult for property
prices to recover.
	   The government has also introduced the Tenants Purchase Scheme,
under which 25,000 rental-housing units would be offered for sale
to tenants each year.
	   ``The perception of a fundamental change in government policies
towards land and housing is beginning to change the long-held
belief that property prices can keep going up and up,'' the report
said.
	   ``There is expectation that residential property will have
limited potential for capital appreciation and may not be so good a
hedge against inflation as it once was,'' the report said.
	   The bank said that property asset values, which have plunged 35
per cent from a peak in the third quarter of last year, make up
about half the total deposits in the local banking system.
	   At the peak of the market last year, the report said, the value
of stock of residential flats amounted to about $3.871 trillion in
total. ``A 35 per cent drop in prices would thus wipe out some
$1.355 trillion from the value of the total stock of
private-residential units,'' the bank's report said.
	   The report went on to say it saw the property collapse cutting
economic growth by at least two percentage points.
	   ``Falling property prices have reduced the values of
collateralised properties for bank loans and contributed to a
contraction in credit,'' the report said.
	   ``The significant negative wealth effect has cut deeply into
consumer spending,'' the report added.
	   Nevertheless, the bank said the plunge in property prices had
largely improved the affordability of housing.
	   The report pointed out that in view of the currency realignment
in the region and the need to restore Hong Kong's competitiveness,
the downward adjustment in property prices was both inevitable and
necessary.
	   However, the steep and abrupt fall in prices had started to
undermine confidence in the economy, the report said.
	   Measures to restore market stability would be welcomed, it
added.
	   Due to the significant role that the property sector plays in
the local economy, the report predicts that the deflationary impact
of the latest downturn is expected to be widespread and severe.
	   Meanwhile, DBS Securities yesterday downgraded its forecast for
Hong Kong's 1998 economic growth to negative 1.5 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product, from its previous level of 1.5 per cent, saying
the government's seven-point emergency economic package will not
have any substantial impact in lifting the economy.
	   DBS chief economist Chu Siu-wah said the emergency plan will
only have a mild impact on both short-term and long-term economic
growth.
	   ``We are rather betting on a relatively stable external
environment in the second half,'' he said.
	   ``The economic condition will continue to worsen at least for
the next six-to-nine months and unemployment will rise sharply to
about four to 4.2 per cent for 1998,'' he said.

Prime minister says vote on constitutional reforms won't shake government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi insisted
Tuesday that his government's stability doesn't depend on the fight
over constitutional reforms.
	   The squabble has grown so bitter that a vote on reforming the
presidency scheduled for Tuesday may be postponed to avoid
embarrassing the government.
	   The dispute centers on what power the president should have to
dissolve parliament.
	   Prodi had said he wants the reforms approved by a large majority
as a sign of wide support for constitutional change. But new
objections from the center-right opposition makes a big majority
unlikely, and there is now talk of scrapping the whole reform
process.
	   Luciano Violante, speaker of the lower house, has said he
believes throwing away a year and a half of work on reform would
prompt early elections.
	   But Prodi on Tuesday firmly rejected the idea that the stability
of his government is linked to the fight over reforms.
	   ``I've always separated the issue of reform from the issue of
government,'' he told reporters after a meeting with Milan business
leaders. ``The are things that don't have points in common.''

Russia expects breakthroughs during Yeltsin-Kohl summit 
</HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Next week's meeting between Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl should boost
economic cooperation between the two countries, a Russian spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin and Kohl are scheduled to meet in Bonn on June 8-9.
	   ``We expect a lot from this meeting,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky. ``First of all, we hope that it will help
boost the whole range of Russian-German economic relations,'' he
told reporters.
	   Yeltsin is also scheduled to meet the leader of Germany's Social
Democratic Party, Gerhard Schroeder, who is leading Kohl in opinion

	   HONG KONG stocks tumbled a sharp 3.6 per cent yesterday after a
government stimulus package failed to dampen fears over the local
economy.
	   The key Hang Seng Index lost 322.55 points to hit 8,612.01. The
steep fall found echoes in other Asian markets as hopes were dashed
of a quick recovery for regional economies.
	   The declines also followed uncertainty in the region following
Pakistan's nuclear test and the yen's fall to near 140 to the US
dollar yesterday, a seven-year low.
	   South China Brokerage vice-chairman Howard Gorges said: ``There
is a sense the market thinks the government is doing too little too
late.''

	   The President of Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI), Sharif
M Afzal Hossain has said the government should keep in the next
budget, a 15 per cent difference on average between the import
duties on industrial raw materials and finished goods to protect
the local industries.
	   ``The average import duty on finished goods should not come down
under 30 per cent while that on industrial raw materials should not
exceed 15 per cent,'' the BCI President said in an interview with
The Independent.
	   The BCI President said that despite the grace period under the
GATT until 2005 for the least developed countries (LDCs), many
industries in Bangladesh had been suffering a setback, and the
problem would worsen after the end of the period.
	   ``Now we often say that the Indian goods are flooding our
market, but if we cannot support our industries for cost
competitiveness, our market will be fully captured by Indian
products after the withdrawal of the grace period,'' the BCI
President feared. ``For example, people are buying Indian sarees
just because of their low price, though the quality of our sarees
is better than that of Indian sarees'', he said.
	   ``The government should take immediate steps for the protection
of the local industries so that they can compete in the global
market after 2005,'' Afzal Hossain said.
	   The BCI President suggested that there should not be any
increase in, tax in the new budget. ``The Government should think
about the purchasing capacity of the people before increasing any
tax. For increasing the revenue, the government can expand the base
of taxes,'' he said.
	   He also urged the government not to raise taxes through the
Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) after the budget announcement.
	   The government he said, should increase allocations in the
budget for employment generation, poverty alleviation, and for the
development of education and the health sector.
	   Sharif M Afzal Hossain also called upon the government to
concentrate more on the agriculture sector.
	   He suggested disbursing micro credit to the unemployed people
from the government level to generate self-employment.
	   The BCI President also called for providing loan to encourage
co-operative farming.
	   ``People's participation must be ensured for sustainable
development, and keeping the vast rural areas in the dark, we
cannot think of development,'' he said.
	   The BCI President suggested a major shake-up of the
administration in order to retrench surplus staff and curtail the
revenue expenditure. ``What we need is an efficient and effective
administration,'' he said.

Child marchers breathe new life into old U.N. agency

	   GENEVA (AP) _ An exuberant group of children rescued from mines,
sweatshops and servitude around the world descended Tuesday on
Geneva to breathe new life into an old U.N. agency.
	   ``Go, go, global march,'' shouted a group of 150 marchers as
they were led into the U.N. European headquarters by 11-year-old
Basudev Bhattarai, a former domestic servant from Nepal, and other
children.
	   Carrying colorful banners and chanting, they livened up the
meeting of the 174-nation International Labor Organization, which
is considering a new world convention aimed at abolishing the most
extreme forms of child labor.
	   ``We must wash this black spot from the face of humanity without
hesitation or delay,'' march co-ordinator Kailash Satyarthi of
India told delegates.
	   The marchers' campaign, sponsored by the ILO, the U.N.
Children's Fund, Scouts and other organizations, began last January
in the Philippines and has included marches in 62 countries
worldwide.
	   On Saturday, more than 1,000 demonstrators brought downtown
Geneva to a standstill as they marched through the streets.
	   Child labor tops the agenda of the annual two-week ILO meeting,
which brings together representatives of government, labor and
management. The ILO draws up and monitors conventions on a wide
range of labor issues.
	   The campaign against child labor was a boost for the ILO,
showing that the oldest U.N. agency stemming from the 1919 creation
of the former League of Nations is still needed to stop labor
abuses around the world.
	   The ILO has been singled out by the United States in its
campaign to reform the world organization. Some U.S. Republicans
have accused it of being irrelevant.
	   Other visitors expected at the meeting are newly freed
Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan, U.N. human rights chief
Mary Robinson and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.
	   The meeting will work on a declaration committing countries to
work toward collective bargaining and the elimination of forced
labor. The new child labor convention would call for criminal
penalties, specify preventative measures and rehabilitation of
child victims.
	   The labor organization also has called for new international
legal standards on child labor that would halt slavery and
slavery-like practices, forced labor and debt bondage.
	   The standards also would prevent children being used in
prostitution and pornography or any activity likely to jeopardize
their health or morals.
	   ILO Director-General Michel Hansenne told a news conference that
the convention would have to aim for realistic targets.
	   Some campaigners, including Satyarthi, are calling for work that
prevents children receiving education to be classed as an extreme
form of child labor.
	   Satyarthi regretted heavy spending on arms by developing
countries, saying children should be their main priority.
	   ILO surveys have found that a quarter of all children ages 5-14
are economically active, with many of them doing hazardous jobs.
	   Every working child ``is working at the cost of an adult's job''
_ very often that of its parents _ Satyarthi said.

	   Chittagong Stock Exchange enters into automated trading system
today, enlarging its business horizon beyond the port city, with
hopes to regain investors' lost confidence.
	   ``The automated system will create a lot of confidence in the
Bangladesh capital market, not only among the locals but also the
foreign investors,'' said CSE chief Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury.
	   Giving a demonstration of the screen-based trading system to a
group of newsmen here on Monday, the CSE President said the system
would ensure transparency in the security trade.
	   He said the foreign investors in particular would feel
encouraged to come back to Bangladesh, ``because they want to see
and invest in transparent capital market''.
	   After opening up of the country's capital market during the
first half of 1990s, the foreign portfolio investors put a
substantial amount in Bangladesh's emerging market.
	   But they deserted the market after a share scam in late 1996
which, many feel, is a result of lack of transparency and
accountability in market activities, coupled with other factors.
	   The Asian Development Bank, approving an 80 million US dollar
loan for the capital market development, called for immediate
computerisation of stock trade to check any future catastrophe.
	   ``Screen-based trading system will substantially increase the
transparency in this situation,'' claimed Khosru setting forth
CSE's road to automation.
	   The CSE president will open the system in Dhaka's Ispat Bhaban
at Karwan Bazar and CSE stockbrokers from Dhaka and Sylhet, apart
from Chittagong, will be able to place sell or buy orders.
	   The systems will be expanded to Bogra and Khulna in the next
phase, Khosru told the newsmen.
	   CSE, the country's second bourse, is the first to introduce
computerised trading system in Bangladesh while the Dhaka Stock
Exchange is due to have it later this month.
	   A total of 30 stock exchanges in the subcontinent have got their
own automated trading system. The CSE's technology is most advanced
just after the Bombay-based National Stock Exchange of India.
	   The Computer Maintenance Corporation (CMC) of India was engaged
for installing the computer systems in the CSE while the American
Bellcore International did the telecoms networking.
	   Khosru said in the first phase that begins today, 113 securities
would be put in the on-line trading, leaving 30 most active
securities for trading on floor.
	   ``The objective is to familiarise the investors with the new
trading system.''
	   In the second phase, due to begin early July, the rest 30
securities, which account for 80 per cent volume in the bourse,
will be put in the on-line trade, he said.
	   ``The CSE is on way to fully abolish its floor trading,'' said
Khosru, a leading business figure in the country who pioneered the
bourse in the port city in 1995.
	   Out of 128 members of CSE, 104 are based in Chittagong, 22 in
Dhaka and the rest two in Sylhet, and all of them will have
computerised systems to call the main server located in Chittagong.
	   The CSE chief said the bourse would regionally settle all the
transactions that will take place on the systems.
	   ``With automation, the turnover in the market will also go up
automatically,'' he added.
	   The CSE boss, however, was dissatisfied with delays in
introducing a central depository system (CDS) which, he said, is a
key to further development of the capital market.
	   ``The full benefit of automation can only be derived if a
central depository system is established in our market,'' said
Khosru, a member of Parliament from the opposition BNP.
	   He said he had placed a private bill on CDS in parliament a few
months back, but things were progressing very slowly.
	   ``The CSE must create confidence. Also the foreign investors
want portfolio managers in Bangladesh the foreign investors want
portfolio managers in Bangladesh market, but it is very difficult
without the CDS.''
	   CSE Chief Executive Officer AGM Shamsul Kamal told newsmen that
they would face some problems with the new system because of the
recently introduced one-day netting-settlement system.
	   He called the new settlement system a ``real clumsy situation''
and said they would have to physically transfer hundreds of share
certificates everyday between Chittagong, and Dhaka and Sylhet due
to the new system.
	   Khosru said they would go by the new settlement system,
introduced by the securities and Exchange Commission, regardless
for its detrimental effect on the stock market.

	   THE Special Administrative Region Government yesterday vowed to
protect foreign investment in intellectual property as part of its
battle against piracy in Hong Kong.
	   Foreign investors would be deterred from putting their money
into Hong Kong industries unless they could be guaranteed that
their intellectual property would be protected from counterfeiters
and pirates, Secretary for Trade and Industry, Brian Chau Tak-hai,
said at an international symposium on intellectual property rights.
	   As the SAR embraces the technological age, pirated CDs, VCDs and
computer software are becoming increasingly popular _ an issue that
is being tackled by the symposium.
	   Speaking at the opening of the World Intellectual Property
Organisation Asian Regional Symposium, Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa also emphasised the importance foreign investors placed on
the protection of intellectual property.
	   ``Our population is densely packed and our society is strongly
commerce-oriented,'' Mr Tung said.
	   ``We are a world telecommunications centre and a leading centre
for film and television production.
	   ``The demand for cheap pirated optical discs is considerable and
this provides the incentive for piracy or counterfeiting.'' He
added: ``To some extent, we are probably victims of our own success
as a major, strategically positioned trading centre and free port,
with a minimum of bureaucratic red-tape for the honest trader.'' Mr
Tung said Hong Kong's laws on protection of patents, designs,
trademarks and copyright works were ``the most complete and modern
in the world'' and that the SAR Government was committed to
protecting the creative talent of Hong Kong people and providing
intellectual property protection for foreign investors.
	   ``My government is determined to protect the creative talent of
Hong Kong people, and to encourage investment here by providing
proper protection for the intellectual property of our many foreign
investors.'' Mr Tung said the Customs and Excise Department and
other law enforcement agencies had seized more pirated optical
discs in the first five months of this year than for the whole of
1997.
	   Mr Chau, who gave the keynote address at the symposium, said:
``For us to sustain and sharpen our attractiveness as a destination
for foreign investment and reap the benefits of technology
upgrading and wealth creation, intellectual property protection is
not a luxury, but a must.''

Saudi prince holds more talks on summit, Jordan wants moderate outcome 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Abdel-Meguid saying full summit not expected.
By JAMAL HALABY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah held
further talks Tuesday on a proposed Arab summit as Jordan resisted
any move that would have the meeting urge cutting off all ties with
Israel.
	   The meeting came as differences persisted over whether to hold
the summit in Syria or Egypt and over how strong a message the
summit should send to Israel about the breakdown of Middle East
peace talks.
	   In Lebanon, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
told the leftist daily As-Safir that he did not expect a full Arab
summit now. He said discussions now focused on a meeting of
confrontation states _ those around Israel _ plus Saudi Arabia and
Morocco.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged a summit to clearly
blame Israel for the negotiations stalemate. Israel-Palestinian
talks have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building
a Jewish housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Abdullah met Tuesday with Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother
and heir, following overnight talks with the Jordanian monarch on
the site and the agenda of the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Saud
al-Faisal met with Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani.
	   After the 90-minute session, Anani said Jordan prefers the
summit be held in the headquarters of the 22-member Arab League in
Cairo, Egypt. ``The context is the most important to us,'' he told
reporters.
	   Syria wants the summit held in its capital, Damascus, where the
government of President Hafez Assad could exert more pressure for a
strong stance against Israel.
	   Underlining disagreements with Syria on the agenda of the
meeting, Anani said more Arab consultations were needed before the
convening of the summit.
	   ``A summit is not something that falls out of a tree ... a
summit must be well prepared,'' he said. ``We don't want to look to
the rest of the world that we are just meeting there to disagree or
meeting there just to exchange blames.''
	   Syria wants the proposed summit to put the brakes on Arabs'
normalization of ties with Israel. At their last summit in 1966,
the Arabs warned of such a step if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu did not keep pledges made in peace talks with
Palestinians.
	   Jordan, the strongest advocate of peace with Israel, is worried
that a hard-line stance could lead to Arab pressures and ultimately
jeopardize close trade and political ties developed since the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   ``There is concern that Jordan and other countries at peace with
Israel might be cornered at the summit,'' said a Jordanian
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He told The Associated Press that Jordan wants the summit to
support the Palestinians and the peace process and ``focus on
Israel's stubborn policy rather than giving Israel more excuses to
distance itself from peace.''
	   Crown Prince Abdullah met with Assad in Damascus before coming
to Jordan. He was scheduled to return home later Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the visiting U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, Thomas Pickering, said after meeting Anani that
the proposed summit should deal with the peace process with ``a
great deal of care and sensitivity.''

	   SOUTH Korea's new consul-general is determined not to be cowed
by the economic downturn in Hong Kong and his own country.
	   In his first interview with the media since taking up his new
position less than a month ago, Consul-General Shin Doo Byong said
the present economic situation should not be seen as a permanent or
long-term condition.
	   ``At the moment both Hong Kong and Korea face some difficulties.
The impression might be created that we are at the bottom. But in a
macro-economic sense we can be rather optimistic,'' he said.
	   It is this sense of optimism that emerges as Mr Shin settles
down to his new task of trying to strengthen ties between Hong Kong
and South Korea at a time when the economic climate is not at all
rosy.
	   But having held a number of key posts in South Korea's foreign
ministry _ his last post was ambassador to Italy _ Mr Shin is too
experienced a diplomat to let the present gloom get him down.
	   ``The relationship between Hong Kong and South Korea has been
very vigorous in the past. For example, Korean Airlines flies
people in and out of Hong Kong daily.'' That, in a way, seemed to
typify for Mr Shin the relationship between the two places.
	   Unfortunately, recent financial difficulties have placed some
understandable strains on that relationship _ the question is how
to come out of that situation.
	   Mr Shin recognises that Hong Kong is the business and financial
centre in this region.
	   The business relationship between Hong Kong and his country is
very important.
	   ``So my priority as consul-general is to build this commercial
and financial connection. My role here is, in a broad sense an
economic one,'' Mr Shin said.
	   Commenting on Hong Kong property prices and rents, Mr Shin said
they were abnormally high.
	   ``If high prices continue there will be business migration from
Hong Kong to cities that are less expensive'' he said.
	   The consul-general believes that a major reason for this was
high land prices.
	   Referring to the economic difficulties facing Korea, he said
they arose from structural problems.
	   There is a need to reorder infrastructure and he is certain that
with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the
country's economy should take off in a couple of years.
	   Mr Shin conceded that restructuring would necessarily lead to
some job losses.
	   But he said the government, employers and employees are jointly
studying such problems in the hope of cushioning the difficulties
that workers might face.
	   He also gave credit to South Korean President Kim Dae Jung who
has taken a personal interest in dealing with unemployment. The
retraining of workers is one of the ways in which it is hoped to
tackle the problem.
	   Regionally, Mr Shin said his country was keen to see more
co-operation with the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
	   The current economic situation in the region and its spillover
effects make it more than necessary to shift the emphasis to the
economic field.
	   With regard to North Korea, Mr Shin said every effort was being
made to improve relations with the Pyongyang regime.
	   The foundation for such improvement was confidence-building
measures from both sides, such as permitting the reunion of Korean
families displaced by the Korean war.

	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed on Monday
expressed the hope that US investors would continue to increase
their investment in Bangladesh in the coming days.
	   The minister, who will attend the launching ceremony of
US-Bangladesh Business Council, in Washington scheduled to be held
there on June 3, was talking to newsmen at his Secretariat office.
	   Tofail Ahmed is leading a five-member delegation which includes
chief whip Abul Hasnat Abdullah, Deputy Minister for Shipping Saber
Hossain Chwodhury, FBCCI President Yusuf Abdullah Haroon, BGMEA
President Mostafa Golam Quddus and Chairman of Bankers Association
Abdul Awal Minto.
	   The council, comprising 15 big American companies, was formed
with a view to enhancing their investment and business activities
in Bangladesh. US Ambassador in Bangladesh John C Holzman and
President of American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh Forest
Cookson are already in Washington to attend the launching ceremony
of the council.
	   The minister said during his forthcoming visit to the USA, he
would seek greater investment in Bangladesh by US investors. He
hoped that the US-Bangladesh Business Council would play an
important role in this regard.
	   Tofail Ahmed said besides exploration of oil and gas, the US
investors have been showing interest to invest in other areas like
the setting up of fertiliser factories and balancing and
modernisation of Karnaphuli Paper Mills.
	   He said American Electric Service (AES) will set up two power
generating units in Bangladesh with a total generation capacity of
810 megawatt.
	   The minister said he will be meeting with US Commerce Secretary
William M Daley when the question of raising the Bangladesh
readymade garment export quota to the US by 30 per cent would come
up for discussions.
	   He said a least developed country like Bangladesh is entitled to
get such advantage from the USA as per the declaration of the World
Trade Organisation.
	   Tofail Ahmed pointed out that Bangladesh was also interested to
increase volume of trade in computer software and data processing
sectors with the USA.
	   During his stay in Washington, he will meet Congressmen and
Senators as well as state department officials including Assistant
Secretary of State for South Asia Karl Inderfurth.
	   He will have a luncheon meeting with US investors in New York on
June 5 before his departure for home.

	   MOVES to crack down on pirated CD peddlers have been drastically
stepped up according to the Customs and Excise Department and real
estate companies.
	   Hong Kong Real Estate Agencies Association chairman Raymond Tse
Wai-man said landlords were introducing rent policies that made it
difficult for pirated CD-sellers to find a store as an outlet.
	   ``Tenants didn't used to have to leave there names on the
contract, they would just put their company name,'' said Mr Tse.
``Now tenants have to provide all their personal information as
well as a personal guarantor.'' Landlords can now be certain if
vendors claiming to sell computer parts or music, are actually
selling contraband merchandise.
	   The Customs and Excise Department has also drastically stepped
up its human efforts.
	   According to the Senior Superintendent of the Prosecution,
Intelligence and Investigation Bureau of Customs and Excise, Wong
Man-on, manpower has been doubled since last year.
	   ``There were about 180 officers working on counterfeit CD
crackdowns in the middle of last year,'' said Supt Wong. ``Now,
there are twice as many.''

	   MEDIA bashing will ultimately affect the public's right to know
the truth, the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association warned
yesterday.
	   The association said this at a demonstration condemning the
increasing level of violence against press photographers.
	   The photographers gathered in Chater Garden, Central, following
two assault cases last week.
	   In one incident, two photographers were injured by a man outside
a bank in Lok Fu, Wong Tai Sin, when they were taking pictures of
people looking at TV monitors which showed the falling stock index.
	   The other incident involved a TV cameraman who tried to rescue a
TV reporter during a sale of Tsing Yi flats on Saturday.
	   A man pushed the reporter while she was interviewing his friend.
The cameraman who went to her rescue was also pushed, causing his
TV camera to fall.
	   Association chairman Sin Wai-keung said at least 39 cases of
assault on photo journalists were recorded since last year, causing
different levels of injuries.
	   A police spokesman said they will facilitate the work of photo
journalists by assigning space for them in major events. Police
would also assist in resolving conflict when it occurred.

	   A day-long workshop marking the visit of a team from Nepal to
food-assisted development programmes in Bangladesh concluded here
on Monday with a call for sharing and exchanging experiences.
	   Jointly organised by Local Government Engineering Department
(LGED) and World Food Programme (WFP), the workshop was held at the
LGED Bhaban here.
	   Besides the 36-member team from Nepal, high officials of the
LGED, Ministry of Food and WFP in Dhaka took part in the workshop.
	   Split into three sessions, the inauguration of the workshop was
addressed by acting Ambassador of Nepal to Bangladesh Dr Rambhakta
P B Thakur, chief engineer of LGED Quamrul Islam Siddiqui, leader
of the Nepalese team Dr Tana Goutam, WFP adviser in Bangladesh
Bishow Parajuli, WFP representative Werner Keine and additional
chief engineer of LGED Monowar Hossain Chowdhury.
	   The Nepalese envoy said Nepal being an agro-based economy, has a
lot of things to learn from Bangladesh.
	   Nepal can specially know how Bangladesh is developing its
agriculture to feed the 12 crore people, he said.
	   Quamrul Islam Siddiqui gave a detailed picture of how
infrastructural development in rural Bangladesh is taking place
under local-level planning and with the active participation of the
elected local government representatives and people. He lauded the
role of the WFP for its enormous contributions in carrying out the
development projects in Bangladesh.
	   The LGED is implementing 31 rural infrastructure development
projects under RD (rural development) and one sector with an annual
outlay of over Taka 607 crore (135 million dollars).
	   He said, of those projects, six are being implemented with food
assistance from the WFP, while the rest are progressing with the
help from bilateral donors and the Bangladesh government, he said.
	   The LGED chief engineer hoped that this ''exposure visit'' of
the Nepalese delegates will help enrich their experiences to have
an on-the-spot knowledge as how Bangladesh achieved success by the
local level development activities. Werner Keine spoke on the goal,
major areas of collaboration and operation philosophy of WFP in
Bangladesh.
	   He said the WFP has mobilised food inputs of 4,50,000 tonnes for
the year 1997-98 worth Taka 697 crore (135 million US dollar)
through RD and VGD (vulnerable group feeding) channels to reach the
''poorest of the poor'' in Bangladesh. Bishow Parajuli said the
Nepalese delegates can learn many things from development
experience of Bangladesh with special reference to rural
development and improved food security. The visit of the Nepalese
delegation is second of its kind to Bangladesh.
	   Earlier a team from Nepal visited Bangladesh in last March. A
three-day workshop of similar kind was held here at that time.
	   Additional chief engineers of LGED Rubaiyat Nurul Hassan and
Monowar Hossain Chowdhury presented two papers on rural development
strategy and food-assisted rural infrastructure development in
Bangladesh in the plenary session-l. Bishow Parajuli and programme
officer of WFP M Younus Khan presented two papers in the concluding

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Forty-six countries joined Tuesday in demanding
that rival neighbors India and Pakistan immediately cease testing
nuclear arms and join in the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' said a joint statement.
	   Islamic countries and others, while expressing concern about the
tests, also criticized the five nuclear powers _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ and urged them to drop their
opposition to proposed negotiations for the scheduled elimination
of their atomic arsenals.
	   India said if the five powers had accepted its previous attempts
to set up global nuclear disarmament, ``we need not have gone in
for our current testing program.''
	   The five were among the countries that backed the joint
statement before an emergency meeting of the 61-nation Conference
on Disarmament.
	   It said India's and Pakistan's tests ``blatantly undermine''
attempts to halt nuclear proliferation and threaten to undermine
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons.
	   The statement, read by Clive Pearson, New Zealand's ambassador
to the conference, said India's and Pakistan's explosions in May
were ``provocative and dangerous acts.''
	   ``Indulging in competitive maneuvers ... belongs to a bygone
age,'' he said. ``It is now crucial that India and Pakistan
announce immediately a cessation to all further testing of these
weapons, renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and
ratify unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.
	   Iran said it viewed the developments with ``deep concern,'' but
also urged the declared nuclear powers ``to fulfill their
commitment to nuclear disarmament in a time-bound framework.''
	   ``In the absence of an all-encompassing program for
comprehensive nuclear disarmament the status and future of the NPT
(Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) will face great uncertainty,''
said Iranian Ambassador Bozorgmehr Ziaran.
	   Despite Tehran's denials, Iran is widely believed to be pursuing
its own nuclear-weapons program.
	   On Monday Iran's foreign minister said on a visit to Islamabad
that Muslims welcomed Pakistan's nuclear tests because it gives the
Islamic world a bomb to counter Israel's widely suspected arsenal.
	   Other non-nuclear nations joined in urging the five main nuclear
countries to commit themselves to nuclear disarmament.
	   ``The South African government believes that these developments
have made it even more imperative that the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva should now actively and with determination
address the issue of nuclear disarmament,'' said Ambassador Jacob
S. Selebi, head of the South African delegation.
	   Australia, which joined with New Zealand in invoking the
emergency session, urged other countries ``to pursue the objective
of a nuclear-weapon-free world.''

	   CHITTAGONG, June 1: Gunshots rocked the Chittagong University
Campus today, when classes resumed after more than 9 months'
disruption.
	   Meanwhile, police arrested three leaders of the Islami Chhatra
Shibir (ICS), from the campus today in connection with a criminal
case relating to the campus violence that occurred on April 26.
	   They are: Shibir's CU unit secretary Mujibur Rahman Monju, F
Rahman Hall president Abul Bashar and Alauddin Hall unit organising
secretary Minhazuddin.
	   APB adds: Protesting the arrests the ICS brought out a
procession in the city's Muradpur area in the afternoon. At one
stage, the processionists turned violent and started damaging
vehicles. Police charged baton to disperse the rowdy elements.
	   Campus sources said panic gripped the CU campus as some armed
men fired gunshots indiscriminately from Shaheed Abdur Rab Hall
area in an apparent bid to hinder rehabilitation of genuine
resident students, which began in six halls at about 10:30 am.
	   The six halls were vacated for 48 hours on Saturday to drive out
the troublemakers.
	   No injuries were, however, reported during the gunfire.
	   CU authorities said some 200 students were given laminated
identity cards by the respective provosts to stay in six
dormitories.
	   Classes in the university were held yesterday and buses and
shuttle trains carrying teachers, staff and students plied as usual
amidst tight security.
	   Bangladesh Chhatra League brought out a procession on the campus
in the morning and held a rally in front of the CUCSU cafeteria.
	   Addressing the rally BCL leaders warned they would launch a
greater movement if the CU authorities rehabilitated the
``killers'' let loose by Shibir in the halls. BCL Cu unit president
Mohammad Shahjahan presided.

Saudi authorities to reveal true story of bombing, says paper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - The Saudi government is expected to announce
next month the results of its investigation into the 1996 bombing
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen, a Saudi-owned newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat said the government has concluded the
bombing was carried out by a Saudi Islamic group with help from
Iranian-backed factions in Kuwait and Bahrain.
	   The report comes amid conflicting statements by Saudi officials
on who was behind the bombing of a military housing complex at
al-Khobar in eastern Saudi Arabia that strained U.S.-Saudi
relations.
	   The Saudis have completed the investigation and ``what remains
is only the announcement ... which could be made soon,'' Al-Hayat
said. It added the results could be made public after the World Cup
soccer tournament which ends in July. Saudi Arabia is participating
in the games in France.
	   Last month, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz
was quoted as saying Saudi citizens were to blame for the explosion
in al-Khobar near the city of Dhahran and foreigners were not
involved.
	   The statement to a Kuwaiti newspaper was the first to rule out
foreign participation in the attack, which also injured scores of
U.S. soldiers.
	   But a few days later, Saudi newspapers reported that the
minister was misquoted and had only said that while Saudi citizens
were the perpetrators, they received help from foreign groups.
	   Earlier Saudi security sources suggested that several Shiite
Muslims with links to Shiite Muslim Iran played a role in the
bombing.
	   Al-Hayat said investigators believe the explosion was carried
out by ``an Islamic group that lives in the kingdom.'' It said some
of the attackers were arrested in Kuwait and were handed over to
Saudi Arabia later.
	   That raised the speculation about their links with radical
Shiite groups of Hezbollah parties in both Kuwait and Bahrain, it
said.
	   The charge has been dismissed by Shiite dissidents in Saudi
Arabia who contend that the Saudi government is using the explosion
as a pretext to target the disadvantaged minority, which has been
agitating for better job opportunities and living conditions.
	   The paper did not explain the discrepancy in the Saudi
statements, but Saudi dissidents said the press leaks on the
explosion reflect a power struggle inside the Saudi royal family
and differences over issues such as relations with Iran.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah is a known to be behind growing ties with
Tehran, while some of the royal family members are believed to
favor a slowdown.
	   Top U.S. officials have publicly rebuked the Saudis for
frustrating their efforts to find out who was responsible for the
bombing. In Saudi Arabia, secrecy has shrouded the investigation,
and Saudi officials have been reluctant to comment.

	   PORK tainted by a banned asthma medicine remains safe for human
consumption, according to the Department of Health yesterday.
	   A spokesman said food surveillance by the department indicated
that the level of clenbuterol residues in pork was low and should
not cause food poisoning.
	   Early last month the government withdrew all pig offal from sale
after the discovery of the banned medicine in the lungs of pigs
slaughtered in Hong Kong. Seventeen people fell sick after eating
the tainted offal.
	   The spokesman said early surveillance indicated a number of pig
lung, liver and kidney samples contained a relatively high level of
clenbuterol.
	   The level dropped sharply in recent samples, he said.
	   ``So far, clenbuterol residues have not been detected in meat
and offal of chicken, cattle and goat.
	   ``However, small amounts of the drug was found in pork and other
pig offal,'' the spokesman said.
	   The voluntary suspension of the sale of pig lung, liver and
kidney will continue until a new system of monitoring and labelling
of live pigs is in place.
	   The Agriculture and Fisheries Department is also stepping up
checks on local farms as well as animal feeds.
	   The department is also liaising with mainland authorities for
measures to be put in place to ensure imported livestock was safe
for human consumption.

of the country. There must be a vision for the next millennium in
this regard.''
	   She said the present government is giving emphasis on
communication in every aspect. She said the construction of road

	   She said the present government could restore the confidence of
the donor agencies through constructive work and planning. In this
regard, she mentioned construction of railway on the Bangabandhu
bridge which was earlier not accepted by the donors. ``We could
made them realise the importance of the setting up of railway on
the bridge,'' she noted.
	   The Prime Minister asked the officials to develop railway in
such a way that people in the suburbs can avail of the railway
facilities. She also asked them to reduce traffic jam by
constructing by-passes and fly-overs in the capital.
	   Sheikh Hasina said her government had taken positive steps for
the development of the country. She directed the officials to
complete the on-going projects in the road and railway sectors
quickly.
	   Describing communications as a service-oriented sector, the
Prime Minister said it must meet the needs of the people. She said
her government did not falter in taking decisions. ``Whenever there
is any problem in exacting the projects, measures should be taken
to solve those as early as possible,'' she said.
	   Earlier, Communications Minister Anwar Hossain welcomed the
Prime Minister and gave a brief resume of the various projects.
	   Secretary of the ministry Rezaul Hayat explained in detail the
projects of the current financial year. He informed the meeting
that 64 projects in the roads and highways division are under
implementation at a cost of Tk 1142,36 crore.
	   The meeting was further informed that the Japanese government
has already undertaken the survey of Rupsha bridge and is expected
to take up the Padma bridge also.
	   Hayat said during 1997-98 a total of 11 projects were
undertaken, of which eight were completed and work of three others
are going on.
	   Dr S A Samad, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Kazi

Lithuanian presidents strikes conciliatory tone with Russia 
</HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Facing renewed harsh Russian reaction
to NATO's possible inclusion of former Soviet states, Lithuanian
President Valdas Adamkus on Tuesday said aspiring alliance members
must understand the Kremlin's anxiety.
	   Adamkus statement came during a visit to the Swedish capital one
day after Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated that
NATO membership for former Soviet states such as Lithuania is
``unacceptable.''
	   ``This is no surprise,'' Adamkus told a news conference. ``I
believe there is good reason for Russia to demand this kind of
status'' _ that the Baltic states stay out of the alliance.
	   ``The attitude toward NATO in Russia will change'' over time as
the Kremlin learns the alliance has no designs on Russia, said
Adamkus.
	   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia all desire NATO membership.
Russia, concerned that membership would give the Western alliance a
strategically critical position along its Western borders, has been
bitterly opposed.
	   Russia last year offered the three countries security guarantees
if they would abandon their efforts to join NATO, but all three
coldly refused.
	   The statement by Adamkus, who became president in February, was
notably more conciliatory than much previous reaction from the
Baltics.
	   ``I hope that by continuous discussion, Lithuania has more to
gain than by taking the rigid and confrontational position,'' he
said.
	   Adamkus, who fled Lithuania during World War II and became a top
environmental official in the United States before returning to his
native land last year, said his decades in America made him
sensitive to another concern of Russia's _ the treatment of ethnic
Russians inthe Baltic states.
	   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians in the Baltics became
stateless after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia
has threatened Latvia _ with Baltics' largest ethnic Russian
community _ with trade sanctions unless it improves their status.
	   Adamkus promised Lithuania would establish ``absolutely equal
rights for all.''
	   ``I enjoyed total freedom (in the United States) for 50 years,''
he said. ``All in Lithuania should have the same rights.''

Russia says rise of Muslim extremism become problem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The rise of Islamic extremism has become a serious
problem for the former republics of the Soviet Union, Russia's
interior minister said Tuesday.
	   ``Expressions of Islamic fundamentalism, or what we call
Wahhabism, at times simple terrorism, have become a serious issue
for the CIS,'' Sergei Stepashin said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The CIS, or Commonwealth of Independent States, represents 12 of
the 15 former Soviet republics, several of whom have blamed Muslim
groups for violence of their territories.
	   Russia and Uzbekistan, in particular, have blamed Wahhabis, a
fundamentalist Islamic sect that originated in Saudi Arabia.
	   Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan recently formed a ``troika,''
whose goals include opposing aggressive Islamic fundamentalism in
mostly Muslim Central Asia.
	   Uzbekistan has enacted a new law on religions that appears
directed at the Wahhabis, who President Islam Karimov says are
intent on replacing him with an Islamic government.
	   Karimov has accused Wahhabis of killing officials and destroying
food-processing plants, water reservoirs, power stations and other
strategic sites.
	   The Russian interior minister said CIS countries have agreed to
cooperating in tracking members of extremist groups, organized
criminals and drug traffickers.

Israeli hotel lets guests work off part of their tabs 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Think your hotel bill's too high? An Israeli
hotel will let you work off part of the tab.
	   Starting this week, the Candle of the Jordan hotel in Tiberias
will let guests work in the kitchen or as housekeepers at a wage of
30 shekels (about dlrs 8.50) an hour.
	   The hotel said a visitor suggested giving guests the option of
working in the hotel to reduce their bills.
	   Guests can work for up to half the price of their stay on Sunday
through Wednesday nights. The price of a double room at the hotel
is 330 shekels (about dlrs 95). So five and half hours of grunt
work would bring the price down to 165 shekels (about dlrs 47).
	   The hotel has branches in Tel Aviv and Netanya, but only the
Tiberias branch is offering the discount.
	   The hotel said it did not expect many guests to take advantage
of the offer.

	   POLITICIANS yesterday welcomed plans to strip the provisional
municipal councils of their powers to control food safety and
environmental hygiene, but said the measures did not go far enough
as they called for the establishment of a new food agency.
	   ``The fragmentation of responsibilities for food safety and
environmental hygiene between the government and the municipal
councils is undesirable and inefficient,'' a government spokesman
said yesterday.
	   He said the bird flu crisis could have been handled more
efficiently if fewer bureaux and departments were involved.
	   Critics blasted the government in December after hundreds of
carcasses of some of the 1.5 million chickens slaughtered were not
cleared away quickly and were found lying on some streets.
	   The Citizens Party welcomed the government's new plan to tackle
food safety and hygiene problems but said they wanted a ``food
agency '' to be launched.
	   Dr Huang Chen-ya, health spokesman for the Democratic Party,
also wanted a new food authority to be set up as long as it did not
promote cost-cutting to the detriment of public food safety.
	   Dr Leong Che-hung, health spokesman in the Provisional
Legislative Council, said: ``I welcome a central body co-ordinating
environmental food safety if it has the power to run things
properly.'' Plans to curb the powers of municipal councils could
make Hong Kong less democratic, a City University academic warned
yesterday.
	   Dr Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, head of the university's public
and social administration department and Democratic Party
vice-chairman, said many of the members running the Regional
Council and Urban Services Department had been elected by the
public.
	   ``If they take away their powers it means that they are
narrowing the number of people involved in the political process in
Hong Kong.''

	   At least 42 double-decker buses will reach Dhaka by July next
out of the total 200 to be procured by Bangladesh Road Transport
Corporation (BRTC), an official handout said in the city yesterday.
	   Of the 42, two buses have already reached the city on Friday
last and five more will arrive on June 8. These 42 double-decker
buses are being procured at a cost of 105.14 million Indian rupees
under the Indian state loans, the handout said adding, each bus
costs Taka 34 lakh in local currency.
	   These buses with 85 seats each will take only 25 to 30 minutes
to reach Gulistan from Gabtoli. The fare of each passenger has been
fixed at Taka eight, the handout said.
	   With the putting on operation of these buses, the handout said,
yet another commitment of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will be
fulfilled.
	   At present, 47 double-deckers of BRTC are in operation in Dhaka
and four in Chittagong. One double-decker bus can carry passengers
double to a single decker bus, four times a mini-bus, 10 times a
baby taxi, and 50 times a rickshaw.
	   The handout said traffic problem will be eased and the
environment will improve with the operation of increased number of
double-deckers in the city.

Turkish youth convicted of insulting police on Internet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In Turkey's first cyberspace conviction,
an 18-year-old was given a 10-month suspended sentence for
insulting the police on the Internet, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The court ruled that Emre Ersoz had falsely accused police of
beating blind people during a demonstration, the daily Radikal
said.
	   Ersoz' accusation was made in a message posted on an Internet
web site, a current affairs forum run by a major Turkish Internet
server, Turknet.
	   Radikal said his sentence was suspended on the condition he is
not convicted of the same charges in the next five years.
	   Turkey is frequently criticized by human rights groups for
abuses such as excessive force by police. Freedom of speech and
expression are severely restricted by provisions in Turkey's
criminal code and anti-terrorism law.

	   TWO major political rivals are of one mind on one issue _ they
prefer maintaining the 18 district boards and merging the municipal
councils.
	   Despite their differences in political ideology, the Democratic
Party and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong
shared the same opinion when commenting on the consultation paper
on streamlining the regional organisations.
	   ``We prefer keeping the 18 district boards intact while merging
the two municipal councils as this could make them more
efficient,'' DAB spokesman Ip Kwok-him said.
	   The DP offered a similar opinion. Fred Li Wah-ming, core DP
member and a Provisional Urban Councillor, believed a merger of the
two councils and maintaining the district boards would be the best
solution.
	   But other parties differed in their views. The Liberal Party has
set up a working group to study the consultation paper.
	   Provisional Urban Councillor Ada Wong Ying-kay who will chair
the group, welcomed the restructuring, saying the existing system
had many problems. But her party would propose another model as the
four suggested by the government were not ``good enough''.
	   The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood believed
merging the two councils and the district boards could increase
efficiency. But Bruce Liu Sing-lee, ADPL's secretary-general, said
food safety and environmental hygiene should not be taken away from
the two councils.
	   The Citizens Party, on the other hand, advocated that an
independent statutory body be responsible for food safety.

Israeli defense minister meets Mubarak, explains Israeli stance 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
met with Egypt's president Tuesday about the Middle East peace
process, which is stalemated by Israel's failure to accept a U.S.
compromise on a West Bank withdrawal.
	   After the nearly three-hour session, President Hosni Mubarak's
chief political adviser Osama el-Baz said Mordechai sought to
explain the Israeli misgivings toward the American proposal.
	   ``According to them, the 13 percent might not be the ideal
percentage,'' el-Baz said. He added that for the Israel, ``the
important thing is to start the final status negotiations after the
withdrawal.''
	   Only one of three scheduled withdrawals outlined in
Israel-Palestinian peace pacts has taken place, but Israel has
pushed to move on to negotiations on a final peace agreement
between the two sides.
	   To break a more than yearlong stalemate in the talks, the United
States has proposed a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13
percent more of West Bank land in exchange for Palestinians steps
to increase security for Israelis.
	   The Palestinians now have complete control over about 3 percent
of the land _ the cities and large towns _ and share control with
Israel over a further 23 percent. Under the U.S. plan, they'd fully
hold 16 percent, with shared area remaining 23 percent.
	   El-Baz said the talks between Mubarak and Mordechai also
``touched upon'' Israel's nuclear capabilities and reporters'
questions to the two concentrated on that issue following the
recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.
	   Mubarak used the opportunity to expand on his proposal for a
nuclear-free Middle East, telling reporters, ``Now I demand that
there becomes a principle to eliminate all nuclear weapons in the
world on a phase of several years.''
	   Mordechai, asked if Israel would sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, said only, ``We would like to sign a
peace agreement.''
	   Reporters were told by officials at Mubarak's Unity palace that
the Egyptian president and Mordechai began their meetings without
aides present.
	   The Israeli minister's trip comes a day after the Israeli
Cabinet discussed the U.S. compromise but reached no decision. The
American proposal is meant to restart peace talks stalled since
March 1997 when Israel began a Jewish settlement in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who initially wanted a 30
percent withdrawal, has accepted the U.S. compromise.
	   The Iraqi-born Mordechai, viewed as a moderate side, has urged a
``double-digit'' withdrawal, seen as a vote for the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel has argued pulling back from more than 9 percent of the
land would endanger its security. Jewish settlers, who want to
retain all the West Bank for Israel, have complained that a larger
pullback would isolate some of their settlements.

	   Speakers at a workshop yesterday lauded highly Bangladesh's
performance in food-assisted projects for rural infrastructure
development.
	   Speaking at the workshop on the ``Food-assisted Development
during visit of the Nepalese delegation to Bangladesh'' at city's
LGED building, they said commendable progress had so far been made
by Bangladesh particularly in the field of vulnerable group
development (VGD) and rural development through the food-assisted
projects.
	   Organised jointly by The Local Government Engineering Department
(LGED) and the World Food Programme (WFP), the workshop was
inaugurated by the Chief Engineer of LGED Quamrul Islam Siddique
while WFP representative in Bangladesh Werner Kiene was in the
chair.
	   Among others, the inaugural session was addressed by the Acting
Ambassador of Nepal Dr Rambhakta PB Thakur, WFP representative in
Nepal Gian Petro Bordinon, WFP Advisor in Bangladesh Bishow
Parajuli, the leader of the Nepalese delegation Dr. Tana Gautam and
the Additional Chief Engineer of LGED Monowar Hossain Chowdhury.
	   A 36-member Nepalese delegation comprising 10 District
Development Community Chairmen, seven Local Development Officials,
six Rural Community Development Engineers, six officials from
Ministry of Local Development, three WFP officials and four
officials of Germany-aided Food for Work programme participated in
the day-long workshop.
	   Two papers on rural development strategy and local government
institutions and food-assisted development projects in Bangladesh
were presented at the workshop.
	   This was the exposure visit of the second batch of Nepalese
delegates to food-assisted development activities in Bangladesh
after the first delegation visited the country in March last. The
purpose and objectives of the visit was to share experience on WFP
food-assisted development activities and future co-operation
between Nepal and Bangladesh. The Nepalese delegation will visit
several rural development and food-assisted projects in Comilla,
Faridpur, Bogra, Jessore and Khulna during their nine-day stay in
Bangladesh for sharing of experience among the participants both
from Nepal and Bangladesh.
	   In his speech Quamrul Islam Siddique informed the participants
that the government has already prepared all the local maps
including those of the inaccessible hilly regions of the country by
using remote sensing methodology and Nepal could be benefited while
preparing its maps of rural areas adopting the Bangladesh formula.
	   He hoped that after inauguration of the multi-million dollar
Bangabandhu Multipurpose Bridge scheduled for June 23, Nepal as a
SAARC member country, would get transit facilities.
	   Mentioning Bangladesh as one of the leading nations achieving
tremendous progress in food-assisted rural development projects,
WFP representative Werner Kiene said WFP has a programme of about
1.65 million tones of food assistance. It is providing 42 per cent
of total external development assistance to Bangladesh which is
exclusively targetted towards the poor with a view to freeing it
from hunger and poverty, he said adding 23 million of the total
population of the country are poorest of the poor.
	   Acting Nepalese Ambassador to Bangladesh Dr Rambhakta PK Thakur
said in this region Bangladesh is developing fast particularly in
the field of agriculture and rural infrastructural development and
that experience could be of immense help for Nepal.
	   Elaborately describing the WFP and food-assisted projects of
other agencies in Nepal and functions of WEP's local government
bodies, Dr Tana Gautam hoped that the exposure visit of the
officials of the Nepalese delegation for the second time will help
explore the fields of common interests of both the friendly
countries.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lee Jong Beom hit a tying home run and Leo Gomez
smashed a winning three-run homer in the fifth inning as the
Central League's second-place Chunichi Dragons beat the Yakult
Swallows 6-2 at Nagoya Dome Tuesday.
	   Lee, formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's
professional league, has eight homers. Gomez, formerly with the
Chicago Cubs, has seven homers.
	   The Dragons are now a half game behind the front-running
Hiroshima Toyo Carp, whose scheduled game with the Hanshin Tigers
at Nishikyogoku on Tuesday was rained out.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Daisuke Motorki singled home a tie-breaking run
and rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi hit a two-run single in the
three-run seventh inning as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Yokohama
BayStars 7-4.
	   The Giants led 2-0 in the first inning on Kazuhiro Kiyohara's
two-run home run, but the BayStars made it 4-2 in the third inning
on a one-run double by Toshio Haru and a three-run home run by
Norihiro Komada.
	   The Giants tied 4-4 in the sixth on Motoki's one-run single and
Takahashi's sacrifice fly.
	   Kiyohara has 10 homers and Komada four homers this season.
	   In the Pacific League, Takashi Mutoh singled home two runs
against William P. Fraser in the three-run fourth inning as the
Kintetsu Buffaloes blanked the Orix BlueWave 4-0 at Sendai.
	   Fraser, formerly with the Montreal Expos, took the loss. He is
3-3.
	   Two other scheduled games were rained out.

	   CARITAS Hong Kong will launch a number of services aimed at
easing the emotional problems of the unemployed.
	   Community development service supervisor Tse Siu-kwong said it
would complement its existing services that help the unemployed
find jobs and provide retraining courses.
	   ``We are going to open 12 support centres for the unemployed in
different districts,'' Mr Tse said.
	   Two centres would open this month with the others opening soon,
he said.
	   ``Those who join can try the retraining and interview technique
courses offered by us. We will also help them find jobs and, most
essentially, they will be grouped together for consulting
services.'' Mr Tse said the unemployed would be asked to form small
groups where they could share their experiences.
	   ``Through these discussions, they can ease their emotional
stress.
	   ``They can encourage each other while searching for jobs.''

	   Speakers at a reception in the city yesterday congratulated
Justice Kemaluddin Hossain on getting the Calcutta based ``Ananda
Award'' for his book titled ``Rabindranath and Mughal Culture''.
	   Presided over by Dr Mohammad Moniruzzaman, the function was
attended by former Chief Adviser to the caretaker government and
former Chief Justice Habibur Rahman and Prof Kabir Chowdhury as the
chief guest and special guest respectively. Mofidul Haq of Rainbow
film society also took part in the discussion.
	   Speaking on the occasion, Justice Habibur Rahman said that every
culture must have some good things and Rabindranath took whatever
things were good in Mughal culture.
	   Prof Kabir Chowdhury said Rabindranath had absorbed the
noncommunal and humanitarian qualities of the Mughals which were
presented in Kemaluddin's book.
	   The book would be regarded as a milestone in Bangla language and
literature, he added.

	   THE Basic Law should be amended to allow the government to
stimulate the economy through a deficit budget during hard times,
the Confederation of Trade Unions says.
	   The confederation will submit a 10-point proposal to the
government on the eve of the first meeting of its task force on
employment led by Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Kam-kuen
tomorrow.
	   Confederation chief executive Elizabeth Tang Yin-ngor, who is
also a member of the task force, described the Basic Law's
requirement for fiscal balances as inflexible when a higher level
of public expenditures was needed.
	   ``This deters the government from formulating a budget to
correspond with the economic climate,'' Ms Tang said.
	   The confederation proposes a $20 billion injection into the
economy.
	   It also suggests the speeding up of infrastructure projects, an
unemployment fund, improved retraining programs, reduced rates and
rent and the scrapping of the labour importation scheme.
	   Ms Tang said the government should adjust its view that recovery
would be led by the private sector.
	   ``The government measures were focused on assisting the private
sector. But in fact, the majority of firms, especially small and
medium enterprises, are in difficulty.
	   ``As the government is relatively rich in this sense, it should
take the lead and introduce more active measures.'' But Ms Tang
said she did not have high hopes for tomorrow's meeting.
	   ``It seems that a set of policies has already been formulated,
and the government just wants to hear our opinion,'' she said.
	   The meeting is expected to discuss retraining programs,
assistance for starter businesses and the review of Labour
Department services.

Jane's: China planning to build aircraft carrier by 2020 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China plans to build an aircraft carrier but it
will not be fully operational until 2020, Jane's Defense Weekly
reported Tuesday.
	   Senior Chinese naval sources were quoted as saying that the
carrier program was approved at last year's 15th Communist Party
Congress in Beijing.
	   But it appears to have been moved from China's 1996-2000
five-year plan to the 2001-2005 five-year plan, the military
affairs magazine quoted naval sources as saying.
	   The delivery of southeast Asia's first aircraft carrier to
Thailand has increased the Chinese military's determination to
acquire the necessary technology, Jane's said.
	   The carrier program calls for a 24-month feasibility study to
produce a design concept, the magazine said in its June 3 issue.
	   ``The People's Liberation Army Navy expects it will take around
18 years to complete building, fitting out, sea trials and training
before the first carrier is declared operationally ready,'' Jane's
said.
	   That means a carrier would not be fully operational until 2020,
it said.
	   A senior naval source quoted by the magazine said one of the
leading Beijing defense studies institutes ``will be tasked with
preparing a feasibility study'' from the year 2000. This will
include a decision on what type of aircraft to use on the carrier,
Jane's said.
	   The magazine said unidentified diplomats believe that China's
Central Military Commission is prepared to wait until 2000 to begin
the study because it still has to secure funding for the carrier
program.
	   ``It is estimated that it could cost dlrs 500 million to
complete the design at home and procure much-needed equipment
overseas,'' the magazine said.

Japan to send delegation of economic officials to Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will to send a delegation of officials to
Indonesia for talks on promoting economic reforms in the Southeast
Asian nation, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The group of officials from Japan's agriculture, finance,
foreign and trade ministries will depart Wednesday for a three-day
visit, said a Foreign Ministry official.
	   Delegation members will hold talks with local government
officials and representatives of Japanese companies, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Japan, the biggest aid donor to Indonesia, had planned to
disburse dlrs 1 billion in loans last month, but discussions with
officials in Jakarta were postponed due to political turmoil in
Indonesia.
	   Also Tuesday, Japan downgraded its warning against travel to
Indonesia to an advisory, Kyodo News reported. The change allows
families of Japanese working in Indonesia to return, but
discourages leisure travel to areas outside the resort island of
Bali.

Saudi authorities to reveal true story of bombing, says paper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Saudi government is expected to announce
next month the results of its investigation into the 1996 bombing
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen, a Saudi-owned newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat said the government has concluded the
bombing was carried out by a Saudi Islamic group with help from
Iranian-backed factions in Kuwait and Bahrain. The report comes
amid conflicting statements by Saudi officials.
	   The Saudis have completed the investigation and ``what remains
is only the announcement ... which could be made soon,'' Al-Hayat
said. It added the results could be made public after the World Cup
soccer tournament which ends in July. Saudi Arabia is participating
in the games in France.
	   Last month, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz
was quoted as saying Saudi citizens were to blame for the explosion
in al-Khobar near the city of Dhahran and foreigners were not
involved. The statement to a Kuwaiti newspaper was the first to
rule out foreign participation in the attack, which also injured
scores of U.S. soldiers.
	   But a few days later, Saudi newspapers reported that the
minister was misquoted and had only said that while Saudi citizens
were the perpetrators, they received help from foreign groups.
	   Earlier, Saudi security sources suggested several Shiite Muslims
with links to Shiite Muslim Iran played a role in the bombing.
	   Al-Hayat said investigators believe the explosion was carried
out by ``an Islamic group that lives in the kingdom.'' It said some
of the attackers were arrested in Kuwait and were handed over to
Saudi Arabia later.
	   That raised the speculation about their links with radical
Shiite groups of Hezbollah parties in both Kuwait and Bahrain, it
said.
	   The charge has been dismissed by Shiite dissidents in Saudi
Arabia who contend that the Saudi government is using the explosion
as a pretext to target the disadvantaged minority, which has been
agitating for better job opportunities and living conditions.
	   The newspaper did not explain the discrepancy in the Saudi
statements, but Saudi dissidents said the press leaks on the
explosion reflect a power struggle inside the Saudi royal family
and differences over issues such as relations with Iran.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah is a known to be behind growing ties with
Tehran, while some of the royal family members are believed to
favor a slowdown.
	   Top U.S. officials have publicly rebuked the Saudis for
frustrating their efforts to find out who was responsible for the
bombing. In Saudi Arabia, secrecy has shrouded the investigation,
and Saudi officials have been reluctant to comment.

	   SATISFACTION with the present state of affairs in Hong Kong has
fallen to a 15-year low, according to a government bi-monthly
public opinion survey conducted last month.
	   Only 44 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied with
the present situation, significantly less than the 61 per cent in
the previous survey.
	   Meanwhile, only 52 per cent of respondents expected the
situation to improve or remain the same in the coming 12 months.
This also drastically falls short of the 67 per cent recorded in
March.
	   The spokesman for the Home Affairs Bureau, which interviewed
1,553 people by telephone on 11-15 May, said the number of people
who expressed satisfaction with the situation was the lowest since
the launch of the survey in January 1983.
	   The spokesman said the issue playing on people's minds were
foreign incidents, like the recent Indonesian crisis, and their
impact on Hong Kong, and fears for the plunging local economy.
	   He said that during the period of the survey, the Hang Seng
Index at one point (on 13 May) dropped 3.78 per cent to close at
9,469.29 as political instability in Indonesia escalated, dragging
down share prices and currencies in the region.
	   He added that continuing layoffs by local firms might further
increase people's concern over the Indonesian crisis.
	   The survey also found that only 32 per cent of respondents
expressed satisfaction with the overall performance of the SAR
Government, compared with 48 per cent in the last survey, in March.
	   Meanwhile, labour and employment were seen as the most important
issues of the day, surpassing housing and the economy in March.
	   About 54 per cent of people listed labour issues as their
biggest concern, compared with 41 per cent in March.
	   Among those concerned with labour-related problems, 96 per cent
cited difficulties in finding jobs, and unemployment.
	   In March the figure was 93 per cent.
	   Housing, which used to be the number-one concern, dropped to
third place, playing on the minds of only 30 per cent of people, a
sharp drop from 46 per cent.
	   Economic-related problems were mentioned by 48 per cent of the
respondents, up from 44 per cent, making them the second-most
mentioned maladies.
	   Of those, 49 per cent singled out the economic depression and a
weak economy as the source of their worries, up from 44 per cent.
	   Among those who cited housing, 43 per cent considered the price
of private housing to be too high, down from 47 per cent in March.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria announced on Tuesday a 22-man
roster for its World Cup squad, including a last-minute goalkeeper
choice and two other late additions.
	   The selection, reported by the News Agency of Nigeria, included
goalkeeper Peter Rufai, who was only called up to the team's
training camp in Switzerland last week.
	   Many Nigerian fans had called for the return of Rufai, who plays
for Spanish side Deportivo La Cornua, to the number one spot on the
World Cup-bound squad after successive Nigerian losses to
Yugoslavia and Swiss club Grasshoppers.
	   Two other unexpected entries to the team were defenders Benedict
Iroha and Augustine Eguavoen.
	   Most of the players are based in Europe and all but one _
defender Jero Shakpore _ play outside of Nigeria.
	   Roster  
	   Goalkeepers: Peter Rufai, Willy Okpara, Abiodun Baruwa.
	   Defenders: Jero Shakpore, Celestine Babayaro, Uche Okechukwu,
Taribo West, Uche Okafor, Benedict Iroha, Augustine Eguavoen.
	   Midfielders: Mutiu Adepoju, Austin Okacha, Sunday Oliseh, Godwin
Okpara.
	   Attackers: Kanu Nwankwo, Finidi George, Rasheed Yekini, Garba
Lawal, Tijani Babangida, Daniel Amokachi, Wilson Orumah, Victor

Recognition of 2 private dental colleges protested, THE INDEPENDENT

	   The conditional recognition of two private dental colleges has
been resented by the sponsors of five other medical and dental
colleges.
	   The sponsors of four private medical colleges and one dental
college have complained to the government that the two dental
colleges did not fulfil the conditions to get recognition.
	   In an application addressed to the State Minister for Health and
Family Welfare, they said the two dental colleges that had been
given registration were functioning on rented buildings and did not
have their own land, buildings and hospitals as per the requirement
of the government.
	   They said their colleges opened with permission from the
University of Dhaka and fulfilled the conditions for being
recognised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
	   Out of 22 private medical and dental colleges functioning in the
country, the ministry recognised eight private medical colleges and
gave conditional approval to two dental colleges on May 7.
	   A ministry source said the decision was taken as per the report
of a six-member committee representing the ministry, the university
and the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC).
	   The source said they refused recognition to nine private medical
colleges as they did not fulfil the conditions set by the
government. The sponsors of four medical colleges and one dental
college in their application claimed that they fulfilled all
conditions. Two dental colleges that have been given conditional
approval hardly fulfilled the conditions, they alleged.
	   These five medical institutions are: Theol Medical College, Umma
Medical College, Ibne Sina Medical College, Al-Shefa Medical
College and University Dental College.
	   The sponsors of these institutions have urged the government to
either recognise their institutions or cancel the conditional
recognition of the two dental colleges.

	   ECONOMISTS are tipping more hardship over the course of the
year, as the economy continues to shrink.
	   Associate Professor of business at Hong Kong University, Leung
Wai-kin, said income would fall as more people joined the ranks of
the jobless.
	   He predicted the unemployment rate would reach 4.5 per cent.
	   ``Negative growth is almost certain for both the second and
third quarters of this year. We may start to see a turn-around in
the fourth quarter,'' he said.
	   Mr Leung said job insecurity would continue to undermine
confidence in Hong Kong and people would consume less. This he said
would further decrease gross domestic product (GDP), the total
value of goods and services produced in the economy.
	   The downturn would be particularly felt by small and
medium-sized businesses, he said, which would be forced to lay off
more staff.
	   ``If you look around on the streets, many shops are closing, in
particular those selling luxury goods.'' Returns from stock market
and property investments would also fall, he said, adding to the
overall drop in total income.
	   However, Mr Leung said it was unlikely the government would
increase the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme to
bring it in line with the rise in unemployed.
	   The rate of increase in people applying for benefits has slowed
despite the 14-year record unemployment rate. Mr Leung said people
were more likely to rely on their savings and families, rather than
apply for the dole.
	   Professor Richard Ho Yan-ki, dean of business at City
University, said many people would maintain a reasonable income
because of investments overseas.
	   He said the government could boost confidence by increasing tax
rebates to stimulate demand.

	   The tenth SAARC summit, scheduled to be held in Colombo next
month, is unlikely to be postponed despite the nuclear stand-off
between India and Pakistan. Host Sri Lanka is going ahead with
preparations for the summit, the Foreign Office sources here said
yesterday. Lankan Foreign Minister Laksman Kadir Gama is expected
to visit Dhaka soon to formally invite Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
for the Colombo summit, the sources said. Gama, as the special
envoy of President Chandrika Kumaratunga will also visit to five
other SAARC capitals to formally invite the South Asian leaders for
the summit.

	   EXECUTIVE Councillor Leung Chun-ying does not believe lifting
the anti-speculative measures had caused a revival of speculation
in the ailing property market.
	   Speaking after a public seminar on housing supply at the
Polytechnic University of Hong Kong, Mr Leung defended the
government's decision to lift the restrictions. ``(The measures)
are after all temporary ones brought in during an unusual time. We
are no longer at that stage.'' He said there was no sign
speculation emerged in the property market after relaxation of the
measures.
	   ``There will be a certain level of speculation around in the
market at any time. But I personally don't believe it has become a
confirmed trend in any way.'' Any of the anti-speculative measures
could be brought back quickly and easily, he said. But he warned:
``What the government needs to do is to monitor the situation
closely.'' He called for calm in the market, saying he believed
property prices had reached a ``reasonable level''.
	   He added he did not see private housing supply change
dramatically over the next six to 18 months.
	   ``Over the next six months at least, I think supply would remain
abundant.''

Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian official urging militants not to
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Large sections of the southern
province of Kosovo remained sealed off by Serb forces Tuesday after
thousands of ethnic Albanians fled Serb mortar attacks on their
villages.
	   Also Tuesday, six political parties in Kosovo accused Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic of using Serb-Albanian talks as a
distraction while he committed crimes against civilians in Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province but are a
minority in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   ``Another Bosnia is happening in Kosovo,'' the parties warned,
demanding NATO deployment in Kosovo.
	   Serbs say their forces in western Kosovo are fighting guerrillas
who want to make Kosovo independent from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   But ethnic Albanians and international aid officials spoke
Tuesday of shelling that forced entire villages to hike through
mountainous terrain to neighboring Albania. Dozens of people have
been reported killed in the last few days as Serb forces
intensified their campaign to wipe out the militants.
	   The situation harked back to the ``ethnic cleansing'' _ the
slaughter or forced departure of minority groups _ that ravaged
Bosnia.
	   With 39 people reported killed over the weekend and fighting
apparently continuing, the latest bloodshed is the worst since a
Serb crackdown in early March left more than 80 people dead.
	   All communications with western Kosovo remained cut off Tuesday,
so no update on Albanian casualties was available. However, Serbs
on Tuesday reported four policemen were wounded Monday.
	   About 2,000 people from Kosovo crossed into northern Albania on
Sunday and Monday. Thousands more have been displaced in the
province itself, according to Kris Janowski of the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees.
	   Virtually the entire Albanian population of the Kosovo border
villages of Junik and Decane fled under attack, Janowski said. The
U.N. refugee agency doesn't know where they are but thinks they
must be in surrounding hills.
	   Refugees interviewed in Albania said they fled shelling by Serb
forces, with 1,500 troops massed in Junik alone. The refugees said
one 3-year-old died on the way.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic Albanian human rights council demanded
Tuesday that a humanitarian corridor be opened for western Kosovo,
saying that residents there face hunger.
	   Pajazit Nushi, head of the council and a member of the ethnic
Albanian negotiating team, said talks with the government scheduled
for Friday could be canceled.
	   ``I think talks cannot continue if the Serbian side does not
withdraw military and police forces from Kosovo and doesn't stop
the state terror against the Albanians,'' he said.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, which rules
the province with a heavy hand, but they are divided about whether
to use force to do it.
	   Adem Demaqi, an ethnic Albanian leader who spent years in Serb
prisons, appealed Tuesday to the militant Kosovo Liberation Army to
refrain from targeting innocent Serb civilians in retaliation for
police brutality.
	   The statement by Demaci's Parliamentary Party of Kosovo was the
first public message to the militants by any Albanian political
party.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko were cheered by thousands as they rode through the capital
in open, gilded carriages Tuesday on the first day of an official
visit to Denmark.
	   The three-day visit included a ceremony at the World War II
memorial in northern Copenhagen and a visit to the Royal Deer Park
north of the capital.
	   Escorted by hussars on horseback, Akihito and Queen Margrethe
sat in an open carriage and waved to the flag-waving onlookers.
Michiko and Prince Henrik, the queen's husband, followed in another
carriage.
	   The Japanese couple arrived Sunday in Denmark for a two-day
private trip that included a visit to the Legoland amusement park.
They also saw Hans Christian Andersen's home in Odense and visited
the Louisiana museum of modern art north of Copenhagen.
	   Akihito and Michiko are to continue to Portugal on Thursday.

Bangladesh to use Insat for accurate weather forecast, THE INDEPENDENT

	   Weather experts of Bangladesh would be able to make accurate
forecasts of cyclones more confidently in the near future as they
would have access to vertical imageries from the Indian
meteorological satellite (Insat).
	   Access to the Insat is expected to improve weather forecasts
because the satellite is located almost directly above Bangladesh.
So long, Bangladesh used to receive satellite imageries from the
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) of Japan which is
positioned above the Pacific at 140 degrees longitude East.
	   To make GMS imageries look like taken from above Bangladesh, a
computer model had so long been in use.
	   Imageries from the US polar orbiting satellite NOAA (National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) had also been available to
Bangladeshi meteorologists.
	   Insat is located at 80 degrees longitude East on the equator.
The land area comprising Bangladesh lies between 88 and 93 degrees
longitude East and between 20 degrees and 27 degrees latitude
North.
	   The arrangements for the installation of an antenna with a
ground receiving station to get pictures from Insat have been
finalised by Sazedur Rahman, Director, Bangladesh Meteorological
Department during his recent visit to India.
	   It would cost Bangladesh approximately Taka seven million (five
million Indian Rupees) to install the receiving ground station.
Necessary funds for this are expected to be earmarked in the budget
for 1998-99.
	   Sazedur Rahman said the Indian Meteorological Department had
supplied all the technical details of utilising the services of the
Insat that has been in the orbit for the last ten years. Bangladesh
would receive imageries from the satellite once every three hours
for which payment will have to be made.
	   Access to the Insat would be most useful to track the movement
of lows, depressions and cyclones over the Bay of Bengal, Sazedur
Rahman said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - If you drive through the European
Union, you'll be safest on British and Swedish roads while Portugal
and Greece are the most hazardous countries, the EU statistics
agency Eurostat said Tuesday.
	   It said per one million inhabitants, 64 people died on British
roads in 1995 and 65 in Sweden.
	   The figures for Portugal and Greece were 217 and 195,
respectively
	   Almost 44,200 people lost their lives on roads in the EU in
1995, 14 percent less than in 1989, the report said.
	   The situation improved in nearly all 15 EU countries in the
1989-1995 period, except in Italy, Luxembourg, and Greece.
	   Eurostat gave these 1995 road deaths figures with the 1989
figure in brackets:
	   Belgium 1,449 (1,993); Denmark 582 (670); Germany 9,454 (9,779);
Greece 2,043 (1,699); Spain 5,753 (7,188); France 8,412 (10,528);
Ireland 437 (460); Italy 6,512 (6,410); Luxembourg 68 (67); the
Netherlands 1,334 (1,456); Austria 1,210 (1,402); Portugal 2,156
(2,409); Finland 441 (734); Sweden 572 (904) and Britain 3,772

Apartheid death squad leader likely to appear as witness in Botha trial

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ One of the apartheid state's most
feared assassins appeared headed Tuesday for a courtroom showdown
with its last hardline president, P.W. Botha.
	   Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating apartheid-era
human rights abuses. But the trial has become a probe into whether
Botha's government sanctioned the murders of black activists.
	   To establish why it wants to question Botha, the Truth
Commission has produced documents suggesting that the State
Security Council, which the former president headed, authorized the
killings of black liberation fighters.
	   Now, the prosecution wants Eugene de Kock, a former police
colonel and death squad boss, to give evidence against Botha.
Botha's lawyers oppose the move.
	   De Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the nickname Prime Evil,
is serving two life sentences plus 212 years on six charges of
murder and 83 other convictions. By appearing at Botha's trial, he
would have a chance to pin some of the killings he committed on the
former government.
	   In his autobiography, published this year, de Kock called
himself a ``sacrificial lamb'' for the apartheid-era state's human
rights abuses and complained that ``the guiltiest of all ... the
generals and the politicians, have got off scot-free.''
	   Aiding the case against Botha _ being heard in George, a
southern coastal city near his retirement home _ could earn de Kock
points in his own amnesty application with the Truth Commission.
	   Evidence that Botha sanctioned attacks against black activists
mounted Tuesday, when retired police commissioner General Johan van
der Merwe testified at a Truth Commission hearing in Pretoria.
	   Van der Merwe linked Botha to the 1988 bombing of the
Johannesburg offices of the South African Council of Churches,
which opposed apartheid.
	   Repeating testimony made earlier, van der Merwe said former Law
and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told him that Botha wanted Khotso
House, the building that housed the church offices, destroyed. De
Kock has admitted planting the bombs.
	   Van der Merwe also testified that Botha's government ordered
security police to commit illegal acts to fight the African
National Congress, which was waging a guerrilla campaign to end
apartheid.
	   Botha's successor, President F.W. de Klerk, negotiated with the
ANC, culminating in the nation's first all-race elections in 1994,
which marked the end of apartheid.
	   Van der Merwe's testimony came during a hearing into the 1988
death of activist Stanza Bopape, who died under police torture. Van
der Merwe, who headed the security police at the time, is seeking
amnesty for covering up the death.
	   Botha has insisted he has nothing to apologize for and has
described the Truth Commission's work as a witch hunt against
whites.

	   PUBLIC confidence has risen slightly since the announcement of
the government's rescue package to revive the economy last Friday,
according to a survey by the Hong Kong Policy Review Institute.
	   But the survey also indicated that people's outlook on the
long-term prospects for the overall economy remained gloomy.
	   The institute surveyed 1,029 people aged between 18 and 64 on
Friday and Saturday after Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen unveiled new government measures to combat a possible
recession.
	   Sir Donald had also unveiled a negative 2 per cent gross
domestic product growth rate for the first quarter of this year.
	   The index on Hong Kong's economic prospects shrank 7.3 points to
75.9 from 83.2 in mid-May, hitting a record low since it first
started in April 1996.
	   The overall economic confidence index, on the other hand, saw a
slight increase from 82.7 to 84.2.
	   Greater improvement was found in indices that reflect people's
views on their immediate economic conditions. The index on
expectations of maintaining personal livelihoods rose from 85.8 to
89.9, and the largest improvement in expectations was seen in
unemployment where hopes lifted from an index reading of 34.2 to
43.1.

	   THE Immigration Department is considering waiving visa
requirements for Russian tourists who visit Hong Kong via the
mainland.
	   The proposal was originally made by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) to attract tourists from Russia.
	   Tapping the market of the former communist country is part of
the package of measures intended to boost tourism which has been
down by 24 per cent during the first four months of the year.
	   A source said the department was quite willing to grant
visa-free access to Russian travellers but approval of the policy
might take some time.
	   ``The situation in Russia has changed since the fall of the
communist government and people now have more money to spend on
luxury goods,'' the source said. ``And besides, Hong Kong is a free
port and most countries have visa-free access.''.
	   However, the department would have to devote a few months
deliberating the issue before the policy was implemented, the
source added.
	   HKTA spokesman Peter Randall said at present, Russians were
still required to get visas if they came directly to Hong Kong.
	   ``But if they are already in the mainland, they should be able
to come to Hong Kong without a visa _ after all Hong Kong is now
part of the mainland,'' he said. HKTA research shows that about
800,000 Russians visited the mainland last year.
	   ``This is a huge market which we can target,'' Mr Randall said.
	   ``But we do not know how many of them will actually come to Hong
Kong,'' he said.
	   Last week, a group of more than 10 travel trade representatives
from Beijing who organise tours for Russians visited Hong Kong for
a five-day familiarisation program.
	   Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang is
leaving for Tokyo today to lead a tourist promotion to Japan.
	   Mrs Chan will be meeting 20 chief executives of Japanese travel
agents to emphasise the importance of the Japanese market to Hong
Kong.
	   Mr Randall was optimistic the promotion will encourage Japanese
tourists to return to Hong Kong.
	   ``We will be telling them that Hong Kong is still a beautiful
place to see and there are many new places which they can visit.''
Mr Randall added that a special summer promotion package _ to be
joined by airlines and restaurants _ would also be unveiled during
the trip.
	   The HKTA has launched ``Hong Kong Month'' for June with a series
of events aimed at showcasing Hong Kong attractions.
	   Restaurants in Tokyo and Osaka will hold Hong Kong food fairs,
while there will be an exhibition featuring the HKTA's new ``City
of Life'' campaign as well as a fashion show with local designers.
	   The number of Japanese tourists has dropped 58 per cent during
the first four months of the year to 267,000.

	   World-famous swimmer Brojen Das died of cancer yesterday at a
clinic in Calcutta, India. He was 71, reports APB.
	   Brojen was the first Asian to cross the English Channel in 1958.
He crossed the chilly channel six times on different occasions.
	   In 1986, the United Kingdom conferred upon the Bangladeshi
swimmer ``King of Channel'', a special trophy.
	   He left behind his wife, a daughter and a son.
	   His body will be brought in Dhaka a couple of days after some
religious rites in India, Bangladesh Swimming Federation sources
told the news agency.
	   Brojen Das, son of late Harendra Kumar Das, was born in
Kuchimara of Sirajdikhan thana of Munsiganj district on December 9,
1927.
	   From his teenage, he had attracted the attention of organisers
and at his 25 in 1952 won the 100-metre freestyle in West Bengal.
	   But his swimming career flourished in the following years when
he won different events in the highest national events in the
highest national level of competition. He took part in different
national and international events during 1943-'61.
	   Having a hobby in sports, Brojen, who dreamt to be the first
Bengali swimmer to cross the English Channel, attained the feat in
1958.
	   He also crossed the English Channel five more times, including
in 1961 in a record time that earned him a place in the Guinness
Book of Records.
	   He obtained a number of laurels, including National Award in
1976, and Atish Dipanker, Kazi Mahbubullah and Jahanara Janakalyan
Gold Medals.
	   He earned Dhaka University Blue in 1956 and was lifelong member
of the Channel Swimming Association of UK, and other international
organisations.
	   Brojen Das served Bangladesh Swimming Federation as General
Secretary for three years beginning 1972.
	   He was also member of various international
bodies-vice-president of World Long Distance Swimming Association
(Atlanta, USA), life member of Royal Life Saving Society (UK) and
life member of Central Swimming Club (India).
	   Condolence
	   President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed expressed deep shock and
sorrow at the death of Brojen Das.
	   In a message of condolence the President recalled the eventful
life of Brojen Das.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also expressed deep shock at
the death of Brojen Das.
	   She observed that the demise of Brojen Das is an irreparable
loss in the sports arena in the country.
	   Foreign Minister, Abdus Samad Azad and State Minister for Youth
and Sports and Cultural Affairs, Obaidul Quader and different
sports organisers condoled the death of Brojen Das.
	   The others who condoled the death of the Swimmer are Deputy
Minister for Shipping and president of Bangladesh Cricket Board
Saber Hossain Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Olympic
Association Lt. General Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman, former president
of Bangladesh Swimming Federation M Asaf-ud-Dowlah, General

Moscow mayor denies presidential ambitions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Tuesday he has no
plans to run for president of Russia.
	   Luzhkov was widely consider to be a leading contender to replace
Boris Yeltsin in the next presidential election in 2000.
	   ``My ambition is to resolve the problems facing the city and
turn it into a civilized, powerful, cultural center,'' Luzhkov said
at a news conference, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin is constitutionally prohibited from seeking a third term
in 2000, and has said that he does not plan to run. But his aides
have occasionally hinted that he might. They argue that Yeltsin's
first term began during Soviet times and should not count toward
the two-term limit.
	   Other potential candidates in 2000 include former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who
came in second in the 1996 election, and former national security
chief Alexander Lebed, who placed third and recently won a
gubernatorial election in Siberia.

	   A $200 million Fire Safety Improvement Loan Scheme for old
commercial buildings and premises was launched yesterday.
	   Up to 400 commercial buildings completed before 1973 and about
500 commercial premises in multi-use buildings might benefit from
the scheme in the coming three years.
	   The Fire Services Department (FSD) will later extend its target
to more than 1,000 commercial buildings built before 1987.
	   The department yesterday began a three-month inspection of the
targeted buildings and premises and said it would issue fire safety
improvement directions if they failed to meet the requirements of
the Fire Safety (Commercial Premises) Ordinance. An amendment to
the ordinance became effective yesterday allowing it to encompass
pre-1973 buildings and premises.
	   Only owners of commercial buildings and premises who have
received directions from the Fire Services or the Buildings
Department will be eligible for a loan. Owners have to meet a
deadline for completing the improvements.
	   Applicants can apply for an unlimited amount of loans if backed
by a bank guarantee or mortgage to repay the loan, and a proposal
from a contractor about the required works.
	   The loans will be charged at the prime interest rate, now at 10
per cent, and will be repayable in 36 months.

Eds: Contains items on Lebanon, Kuwait and Egypt
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's foreign currency reserves
increased by dlrs 187.66 million in the second half of May, raising
the total to dlrs 2.946 billion, the Central Bank said in a report
published Tuesday.
	   The report said the total currency reserves stood at dlrs 2.532
billion at the end of April.
	   That brought Lebanon's total foreign exchange reserves, which
include currencies, gold and other assets, to dlrs 5.89 billion,
said the report, which was published Tuesday in An-Nahar newspaper.
	   In October, the Central Bank had reserves of dlrs 6.17 billion
but it had repeatedly intervened since then to defend the pound
against speculators on the exchange markets.
	   The pound remained stable despite the pressure and currently
trades at 1,520 pounds to the dollar.
	   The pressure on the currency was due to a sharp rise in the
state budget deficit, a rise in foreign debt and a slow economic
growth.
	   Deposits of dlrs 600 million from Saudi Arabia, dlrs 100 million
from Kuwait and dlrs 100 million from the United Arab Emirates in
recent months helped replenish the coffers.
  ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Despite an economic crisis back home,
Malaysian businesses remain interested in investing in Lebanon,
Malaysia's minister of international trade and industry said in
remarks published Tuesday.
	   Rafidah Aziz said that although Malaysia had withdrawn from a
project to build a hotel in downtown Beirut ``this does not mean we
are no longer interested in making joint investments in Lebanon and
specially in the industrial field.''
	   The dlrs 175 million hotel project by a Malaysian consortium was
canceled because of the economic turmoil in Asian countries.
	   Rafidah made the comments at a Lebanese-Malaysian business
conference in Beirut Monday, the Daily Star newspaper said.
	   She is leading a 50-strong Malaysian trade delegation on a
regional tour that also includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. She also made a pitch for investment in her own country.
	   ``We have a lot to offer Lebanese and foreign investors in terms
of joint ventures and business,'' she said.
	   Lebanon's minister of economy and trade, Yassin Jaber, told the
conference that postwar Lebanon is a good place to invest.
	   He said 130 infrastructure rehabilitation projects will be
available in the next few years, according to the An-Nahar
newspaper.
  ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's prime minister said the wheel of economic
reform has ``started turning'' and Kuwait is going to become one of
the most important commercial centers in the area.
	   Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah said the reforms, including the
introduction of taxes and fees for public services, were not going
to affect those with limited income. He did not elaborate.
	   Sheik Saad, who is also the crown prince, was addressing more
than 1,000 dinner guests Monday.
	   He said the first step in revitalizing the oil-dependent economy
was establishing the country's free trade zone, which is expected
to become operational in around three months.
	   He said directives have been given to cut red tape for opening
new businesses and for issuing entry visas to foreign investors. A
new law was being considered for allowing foreigners to own 100
percent of businesses, he added.
	   Sheik Saad called on Parliament to cooperate with the government
and pass the proposed reform laws, which come with with unpopular
measures.
	   Kuwait estimates its budget deficit for the fiscal year that
starts next month at 1.73 billion dinars (dlrs 5.65 billion),
mostly because of low oil prices.
  ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq will give Egyptian products priority in
new contracts under an oil-for-food deal, Iraq's Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said here Tuesday.
	   Saleh told reporters that a fair for Egyptian products will be
held in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, June 16-23.
	   He said the oil-for-food deal has not succeeded in easing the
suffering of Iraqi people. The Dec. 1996 deal is designed to
alleviate the impact of sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading
Kuwait in 1990
	   In the first three phases of the deal, Iraq was allowed to sell
dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months, but that amount was
raised to dlrs 5.2 billion in the fourth phase.
	   Egyptian Minister of External Trade Ahmed Guweili, who received
Saleh at the airport, said he will discuss with the Iraqi official
ways to increase trade between the two countries. He added that 106
Egyptian companies will participate in the Baghdad fair.
	   In the first three phases, Egypt was the second largest Arab
exporter to Iraq after Jordan. Egypt exported goods worth dlrs 170
million and Jordan exported dlrs 292 million worth. France was the
top exporter with a value of dlrs 572 million.

Analysts predict Pakistan may declare moratorium on debt repayment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan may have to declare a
moratorium on repaying its debts as international sanctions bite
into its reserves, say financial analysts.
	   The government also may devalue the Pakistani currency by 3-to-5
percent to discourage imports that are further draining the
economy, said a report by the Dutch ABN Amro Bank NV obtained
Tuesday.
	   The grim outlook from one of Pakistan's top independent
analytical groups was a result of a drop in Pakistan's
international credit rating following sanctions imposed after it
exploded a series of nuclear tests last month.
	   A government reaction to the report, dated June 1, was not
immediately available.
	   Pakistan declared a state of emergency May 28, blocking foreign
currency withdrawals for fear of a run on bank deposits of dlrs 13
billion. It also froze the exchange rate at 46 rupees to the
dollar.
	   Until last week, Pakistan had one of the most liberal exchange
policies in South Asia, having made its currency fully convertible.
	   Government reserves were a paltry dlrs 1.3 dollars a week ago,
just enough to cover three weeks worth of imports. Its foreign debt
is dlrs 30 billion, of which it repays an estimated dlrs 4.7
billion per year.
	   Standard and Poor, the international rating agency, downgraded
Pakistan's long-term and short-term foreign currency issuer credit
rating. That will make it tough for the treasury to borrow
financing for its six-month oil import bill of dlrs 926 million,
the report said.
	   ``The possibility that Pakistan may have no option but to stop
servicing some of its external debts becomes increasingly real,''
said the report.
	   A debt moratorium, it said, would do ``irrevocable damage'' to
Pakistan's standing in the capital markets and its ability to
compete globally.
	   After the U.S.-led sanctions were imposed, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif announced an austerity program, beginning with his own move
from the newly opened 400-room government Secretariat, in a bid to
cut non-development expenses.
	   But the Amro report said the program was unlikely to help, since
nearly half _ or 47.7 percent _ of Pakistan's non-development
spending was earmarked to repay debts.

	   Home Minister Rafiqul Islam expressed the confidence yesterday
that India would not, in the name of illegal immigration, push
people into Bangladesh. He said that during the recent meeting
between the Directors General of the Bangladesh Rifles and the
Border Security Forces (BSF) of India, the Indian side assured that
they would not resort to such step.
	   The Home Minister was exchanging views with the members of the
Overseas Correspondents Association at the auditorium of the
Muktijoddha Museum at Segun Bagicha.
	   Rafiqul Islam said that the fate of Anup Chetia, whether he
would be deported, would be determined by the court. He said that
Anup Chetia was being tried on some specific charges under the law
of the land.
	   The Home Minister said that the law and order situation was not
alarming. The alarming situation was that the culprits who were
being arrested by police were frequently being given bail by courts
due to loopholes in the law.
	   He said that incidents like child abuse used to occur earlier
too, but those cases would not have been reported due to lack of
awareness.
	   He said that the government had taken up several programmes for
reforming the police force and jail administration and those would
be implemented soon.
	   He said that then Interpol was helping in tracking the killers
of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and talks were being held with
different countries to repatriate the killers who are taking
shelter there.
	   President of OCAB Jaglul Alam Chowdhury welcomed the Home
Minister while Secretary of the OCAB Nadim Quadir proposed a vote
of thanks.

	   TWO Hong Kong long-distance calling card holders were landed
with phone bills totalling thousands of dollars while they were in
the United States in March and April.
	   Leaked information on account numbers and Personal
Identification Numbers (PINs) is believed to be behind the
unauthorised calls.
	   This has resulted in an alert issued by the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority (Ofta) to card users to tighten
security. Long distance calling card holders should be careful when
using public pay phones, Ofta said.
	   They should also make sure nobody is looking over their shoulder
when they make the calls.
	   Ofta gave the advice yesterday after two Hong Kong people
complained each was charged thousands of dollars before they
discovered more than 45 unauthorised calls had been made in
different states in the US to different countries in one day in
March and April.
	   This happened despite the fact that neither had lost their cards
and that they had used them in different US airports.
	   They have complained to both the US and Hong Kong authorities.
	   The two cases indicated that the access information of the
calling card accounts has been intercepted, Ofta spokesman Danny Ng
Kwan-cheong said. He said Ofta was unsure of how the information
had been leaked.
	   Although the office has received only two complaints, it has
issued tips on tightening the security of calling cards, including
changing the PIN on notification of new calling cards; changing the
PIN from time to time; not revealing the PIN to anyone under any
circumstances; and, in the case of company cards, assigning one
card to one person only to ensure proper accounting by the user.
	   Mr Ng also said that when making a call from any telephone,
especially on a digital display phone and a public pay phone,
``always prevent others from seeing the calling card number and PIN
and after terminating the call, clear the memory for redial from
the same telephone by lifting the handset again and dialling a
number at random''.
	   If callers make an operator-assisted call using the calling

	   TOP corporate decision makers are shying away from foreign
direct investments (FDI) in the region, particularly in countries
that have borne the brunt of the economic turmoil, and are now
favouring China, Brazil and Poland.
	   The survey by management consultants A T Kearney, highlights
South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia among countries in
which senior managers have the least confidence in their
suitability for FDI.
	   Hong Kong's allure has been eroded slightly, with 80 per cent of
all respondents citing no change in their outlook for investment in
Hong Kong compared with a year ago.
	   ``South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have suffered
the worse reversals of fortune of all of the countries surveyed,''
said Paul Laudicina, an A T Kearney vice-president.
	   ``Nevertheless, serious corporate investors, while shaken,
appear ready to ride out the turmoil on the strength of Asia's
long-term fundamentals.'' The survey among 150 executives from the
world's largest companies, said market size, political stability
and regulatory environment were the three most important factors
senior executives consider before making direct investments.
	   Mr Laudicina said that the survey was conducted prior to the
civil and political unrest in Indonesia.
	   However, senior managers still had a negative outlook for FDI in
the region.
	   ``Events that were taking place in the region were sufficiently
worrysome to investors that 35 per cent of the executives
interviewed said they had an overall downward shift of perception
of the Indonesian market, followed by Thailand, Malaysia and South
Korea,'' he said.
	   China's enormous market and political stability continue to
attract foreign investors.
	   It ranks third in the overall index with 66 per cent of
respondents expressing a medium to high likelihood of investing
there in the next one to three years.
	   However, Mr Laudicina said China would experience a 9 per cent
decline in FDI this year over 1997.
	   ``But we're still talking about US$40 billion (HK$312 billion)
in FDI in 1997 over US$44 billion which was a record year in
1996.'' More than 30 per cent of all surveyed expressed a greater
likelihood of investing in Brazil and Poland compared with a year
ago.

	   A Metropolitan Magistrate on Monday issued a summons against
Jatiya Party leader Naziur Rahman Manzur on charge of criminal
defamation under section 500 and 501 of the Penal Code.
	   The order was issued following a complaint lodged by Iffat
Obaid, wife of late Obaidul Huq Babul, who prayed for a warrant of
arrest, trial and punishment of the accused for committing the
offence of criminal defamation.
	   Iffat Obaid in her complaint alleged that Naziur Rahman Manzur
had lowered her in the estimation of people in the society by
making a malicious and false statement against her.
	   Naziur Rahman's derogatory remarks about the lady was published
in different national dailies on 30 May as a reaction to the
confessional statement of an arrested accused in Babul murder case.
	   Iffat Obaid, mother of two children and a college teacher by
profession submitted newspaper clippings and a photo-copy of her
passport before the court in support of her complaint.
	   After taking the petition into cognizance, Harunuzzaman Bhuiya,
a magistrate first class of the Metropolitan court, ordered the
issuance of the summons to Naziur Rahman asking him to appear
before the court on the next date of hearing on July 6, 1998.

Steffi Graf to drop out of rankings
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Steffi Graf, who has spent more time as the No.
1-ranked woman than anybody else, will drop out of the WTA Tour
rankings on Monday.
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles title, has played only
two tournaments since she was beaten last year at the French Open.
A player must play at least three tournaments in a year to stay
ranked.
	   The German, No. 60 in the latest WTA weekly rankings, held No. 1
for 374 weeks, topping No. 2 Martina Navratilova at 331. Graf, who
will be 29 later this month, last held the No. 1 spot on March 30,
1997.
	   Graf's recent comeback attempt has faltered since undergoing
reconstructive surgery on her left knee. She has also battled groin
and leg injuries since then and has played only in tournaments in
Indian Wells, California, and Hanover, Germany.

Steffi Graf to drop out of rankings
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Steffi Graf, who has spent more time as the No.
1-ranked woman than anybody else, will drop out of the WTA Tour
rankings on Monday.
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles title, has played only
two tournaments since she was beaten last year at the French Open.
A player must play at least three tournaments in a year to stay
ranked.
	   The German, No. 60 in the latest WTA weekly rankings, held No. 1
for 374 weeks, topping No. 2 Martina Navratilova at 331. Graf, who
will be 29 later this month, last held the No. 1 spot on March 30,
1997.
	   Graf's recent comeback attempt has faltered since undergoing
reconstructive surgery on her left knee. She has also battled groin
and leg injuries since then and has played only in tournaments in
Indian Wells, California, and Hanover, Germany.

	   Security Guard Emdadul Haque, arrested in connection with the
murder of housewife Rubina Akter Ruby (25) on Friday, is reported
to have admitted his involvement in the killing before the
Metropolitan Magistrate on Monday. He was sent to jail after the
confession.
	   Earlier, another guard, Arif, and housemaid Sharifa were sent to
jail after they gave their confessional statements to the
Metropolitan Magistrate on Sunday.
	   In his statement, Emdad confessed that Samad induced him by
offering Tk 10,000 in cash to assist him in killing Rubina. He was
on guard during the time of the incident when Arif and Samad
entered the apartment of Rubina. Samad used the balcony and opened
the main door through which Arif entered the apartment. They killed
the housewife.
	   Ruby (25) was murdered at her residence at Shantinagar in the
city on Friday last.
	   Maid Sharifa was arrested from her home at Shabazpur village in
Sharail thana in Brahmanbaria district on Saturday while guards
Arif and Emdad were arrested from Shantinagar on the day of the
incident.
	   Sharifa told the Magistrate that she abetted the main accused
Samad in killing Ruby. She said that she had an affair with Samad
since long and they had physical relation as well.
	   Sharifa stated that she was sacked and driven out of the house
by Rubina one and a half months ago when Samad proposed to her.
	   This incident infuriated them and they decided to kill Rubina,
Sharifa said. She added that she came to Dhaka to meet Samad two
days before the murder and returned home the same day.
	   The main accused, Samad, has been remanded in police custody for
seven days.
	   The case is being investigated by the Detective Branch (DB) of
police. Blood-stained clothes of the victim and Samad have been
sent for forensic test.
	   Rubina was a level-2 student of the Institute of Cost Management
and Accountancy of Bangladesh.
	   Ruby's body, which was kept at the BIRDEM Hospital awaiting her
US-resident husband's arrival, was laid to rest at Azimpur
graveyard after namag-e-janaza at the Baitul Mokarram National
Mosque and on the ICMAB premises on Monday. Ruby's husband
Moyeenuddin Ahmed Ritu arrived in the city from the USA in the
morning.
	   Meanwhile, a DB police squad went to Samad's village home in
Jamalpur district to verify the statement given to the DB
investigators.
	   In his statement, Samad stated that he offered Tk 20,000 to each
of the two guards and he had managed the money from his own
resources, said a DB police official on Monday.

	   DAIRY Farm International Holdings is shelling out US$209.7
million (HK$1.6 billion) cash to redeem convertible notes it had
issued.
	   The company said it had enough cash to retire 197,921
convertible cumulative preference shares.
	   Dairy Farm's group finance director Edouard Ettedgui said
retiring the shares would help enhance earnings.
	   He said the company will still have enough cash to pursue its
development program in the Asia-Pacific region after the share
buybacks.
	   ``Dairy Farm has available significant cash resources following
recent disposals of non-core operations,'' Mr Ettedgui said.
	   The convertible preference shares originally issued in May 1993
will be redeemed on 2 July.
	   The total redemption price represents US$207.8 million, or 105
per cent of the reference amount of US$1,000 per convertible
preference share as required by the original terms of the issue and
US$1.9 million in accrued interest.
	   The redemption is being funded from existing cash resources.
	   Dairy Farm, a part of the Jardines group, is an international
retailing and wholesaling group focused on the Asia-Pacific region.
	   In 1997, Dairy Farm posted sales of US$6.9 billion.
	   As of 31 December 1997, the group operated 1,352 outlets,
principally supermarkets, convenience stores and drugstores, and
employed about 45,600 people.
	   The group also owns a 50 per cent interest in Maxim's Caterers,
Hong Kong's largest restaurant and catering company with more than
300 outlets in Hong Kong and the mainland; and a 32 per cent
effective interest in the Jakarta-listed supermarket company, Hero
Supermarket, which has some 70 outlets in Indonesia.
	   Dairy Farm International is closing down its Wellsave
Supermarket joint venture in Japan.
	   The group has abandoned Europe as a market with the sale of its
11 per cent stake in British supermarket chain, Somerfield in March
for US$290 million.

Steffi Graf to drop out of rankings
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Steffi Graf, who has spent more time as the No.
1-ranked woman than anybody else, will drop out of the WTA Tour
rankings on Monday.
	   Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles title, has played only
two tournaments since she was beaten last year at the French Open.
A player must play at least three tournaments in a year to stay

	   A young garment employee was shot dead by unidentified
assailants in the city's Tejkunipara area while an alleged mugger,
who was severely beaten up by a mob, died at the Dhaka Medical
College Hospital (DMCH) on Monday.
	   According to family sources and witnesses, three boys, aged
between 12 to 15 years, caught Syed Sadiqur Rahman Masum (35), a
merchandiser of the Continental Garments Limited, while he was on
his way to his garment factory at about 8:45 am.
	   They pressed him against the wall of the Saint Margareta
Tutorial School at 73/3, Tejkunipara, about 50 yards from his
residence, and shot him from a close range. Then they left the
place firing blank shots in the air, witnesses said.
	   Hearing the sound of gunshots, the victim's elder brother Syed
Rezaur Rahman came out of their house and found Masum lying on the
spot. He was immediately rushed to the Dhaka Medical College
Hospital (DMCH) where the attending doctors declared him dead.
	   The body was handed over to the victim's relatives after
autopsy. He was laid to rest at the Mirpur Intellectuals' Graveyard
after holding namaj-e-janaza at the local mosque after Asr prayers.
	   A case was filed with Tejgaon thana in connection with the
incident. The police picked up two persons and were on the hunt for
the culprits. None was arrested till last night.
	   Police said the victim was also engaged in procuring goods for
the garment factory and had fallen out with the local mastans over
selling waste fabrics of the factory a few days back. The police
suspect that the killing might have been a sequel to that quarrel.
	   Masum was married and was the father of a three-year-old boy. He
was the second son of late Syed Habibur Rahman of 73, Tejkunipara.
	   Meanwhile, the alleged mugger Masum (20), who was under
treatment at the DMCH, succumbed to his injuries at about 12:10 pm
on Monday.
	   Masum was caught by the people of Dania area while in the act of
mugging a garment girl in front of the house of one Haji Kamar Ali
at Dania Kabarkhana Road on Sunday night.
	   The angry people beat him up leaving him unconscious on the
spot.
	   The police admitted the victim to the Dhaka Medical College
Hospital.
	   Two separate cases were filed with Demra thana in this
connection. None was arrested.

Semi-Tech slams SEHK for delay in bonus warrant issue, HONGKONG STANDARD

<TEXT>
	   SEMI-TECH (Global) yesterday said the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong (SEHK) was to blame for the sudden halt in the company's bonus
warrant issue.
	   The manufacturer of sewing machines and consumer durables
alleged it had received assurances from the stock exchange that the
issue could go ahead.
	   Semi-Tech proposed a bonus warrant issue of one new share for
every 10 existing shares held, and a bonus issue of two 2001
warrants for every one existing 1998 warrant held.
	   The company was verbally told the proposal of a bonus warrant
issue was fine before the announcement dated 27 May, a source close
to the company said.
	   ``That's why the company went ahead with the announcement which
was published in the press the day after,'' said the source.
	   He said the withdrawal of the proposal had nothing to do with
the company's financial situation or business operation.
	   However, the exchange said it did not approve the proposal for
the bonus warrant issue since it violated certain sections of the
rules governing the listing of securities on the stock exchange.
	   A spokesman for the stock exchange refused to respond to
Semi-Tech's allegations yesterday, saying the bourse did not
comment on individual cases or companies.
	   However, the spokesman did add that according to Chapter 15 of
the listing rules, such warrants must expire not less than one _
and not more than five _ years from the date of issue or grant and
must not be convertible into further rights to subscribe securities
which expire less than one year or more than five years after the
date of issue.
	   ``The company feels very puzzled about the decision made by the
exchange since it had said the proposal was fine on the one hand
but did not approve it after the related announcement was
published,'' said the source, adding that the issue will hurt
Semi-Tech's image.
	   The company has no immediate plans to put forward a substitute
for the bonus warrant issue proposal, said the source.

	   WAH Nam Group, the parent company of beleaguered Wah Hing
Securities, will not provide any financial assistance to its
brokerage unit although it is on the verge of collapse.
	   Wah Hing Securities last Friday asked its clients to settle
their accounts as soon as possible and suspended its business.
	   The Wah Nam Group, a publicly traded electronics firm which owns
93 per cent of Wah Hing, said in a stock exchange filing yesterday
that it would ``not provide any guarantee for the provision of
borrowing facilities to Wah Hing''.
	   The collapse of the brokerage would have ``no effect'' on the
financial position of Wah Nam Group, the firm said.
	   Last Friday, Wah Hing asked the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
(SEHK) to suspend trading in its shares, saying it was undergoing
restructuring.
	   Following the suspension, the exchange sent a team to
investigate the brokerage, which has 2,000 clients.
	   ``The exchange found the firm able to settle clients' accounts
smoothly,'' an SEHK spokesman said.
	   The suspension of the company's operations means that
cash-clients had to regain possession of their shares while
margin-clients had to settle their accounts.
	   A Securities and Futures Commission spokesman said at the time
the broker had applied voluntarily to be suspended. He declined to
give further details.
	   The potential collapse of Wah Hing could be another blow to an
industry hammered by a spate of collapses and malpractice.
	   Last week, Wah Nam Group said it posted a net loss of $34.3
million for 1997.

	   Late President Ziaur Rahman and the GOC of Chittagong cantonment
Major General Manzur were killed by a common killer through a well
designed conspiracy, Awami League leader Col (rtd) Shawkat Ali MP
said on Monday.
	   ``Gen Ershad killed President Ziaur Rahman to clear his way to
power and made General Manzur responsible for the killing along
with a number of army officers who were Freedom Fighters,'' he
alleged at a function on Monday in the city.
	   ``The conspiracy was planned to eliminate Freedom Fighters from
the army and executed so successfully that common people can hardly
believe,'' added Col (retd) Shawkat who is also Chairman of the
Bangladesh Muktijuddha Sanghati Parishad (BMSP).
	   He demanded an immediate enquiry into the killings of Gen Zia
and Manzur and the subsequent trial, execution and purging of army
officers who belonged to the side of the liberation war.
	   The late President Ziaur Rahman was killed on May 30 at
Chittagong Circuit House in 1981 and Gen Manzur was killed later on
June 2 in Chittagong Cantonment.
	   Col Shawkat claimed: ``The whole episode was a conspiracy
designed by those who opposed the liberation war.'' He also
demanded trial of the war criminals under the International War
Crime Tribunal Ordinance which was incorporated in the country's
legal system, he pointed out.
	   Col Shawkat was presiding over the function held at the National
Museum under the auspices of the Manzur Smrity Parishad (MSP)
marking the launching of ``Zia Manzur Hatya Kanda abang Tarpor'' (
The killings of Zia and Manzur and the aftermath), by ASM Shamsul
Arefin.
	   Advocate Gaziul Haq, Major General (retd) Sayed Muhammad Ibrahim
BP, Major (retd) Rezaul Karim Reza, Director General of Bangla
Academy, Sayed Anowar Hossain, journalist Abed Khan, writer
Shahriar Kabir and ASM Shamsul Arefin also spoke on the occasion.
	   Advocate Gaziul Haq who took part in the trial as a defence
lawyer for Brig Mohsin, one of the accused at the Military Tribunal
who was later executed, said: ``The judgement of the trial was
predetermined.''
	   This was written out of the tribunal by a lawyer who later
joined the Ershad's cabinet and became a leader of the Jatiya
Party. He is now in the BNP, he said.
	   Maj Gen Ibrahim demanded a fresh enquiry into the episode and
said: `` The trial inside Chittagong Prison was illegal and totally
manipulated.''
	   Major Reza who was with Gen Manzur till his surrender said: ``
Gen Manzur was a victim of conspiracy and was not involved in the
Zia killing.''

	   BUSINESSMAN Stanley Ho's three floating seafood restaurants in
Aberdeen have taken a serious hit with the downturn in tourism.
	   Melco International Development said its restaurant business
recorded a 40 per cent profit drop during the first five months of
the year compared with the same period last year.
	   Chairman Stanley Ho said the Asian financial turmoil and the
depressed state of the Hong Kong economy had a direct impact on the
restaurants' business.
	   Tony Yau, deputy general manger of Aberdeen Restaurant
Enterprises, a subsidiary of Melco International, said profit was
especially hard hit by the significant decline in Japanese tourist
groups, the largest customer sector visiting the restaurants.
	   This has directly affected the turnover and the profitability of
the restaurant operation.
	   Before the tourist arrivals slump, he said, tourists accounted
for 65 per cent of the total customers, while locals accounted for
the remaining 35 per cent.
	   While the reduction in tourist groups visiting the floating
restaurants represents a short to medium term change in the
restaurants' customer mix, contribution from the two segments are
now more or less the same.
	   While the group has no intention of introducing price cuts to
boost sales, profit margin is expected to be maintained at last
year's level.
	   Due to the business downturn, difficulties are expected to
remain for some time this year according to Melco International
director, Patrick Huen.
	   Mr Huen said the group had implemented tighter cost control
measures and laid off some 80 employees in April.
	   He said the group had no immediate plans to cut staff further.
He said the group's capital remained intact with more than $200
million cash in hand.
	   In fiscal 1997, interest income reached $13.64 million, and is
expected to remain as a significant source of income for the group
during 1998.
	   Mr Huen said a plan for acquisitions using surpluses had been
held back as management was alarmed by the approaching financial
turmoil in the second half of 1997.

	   The abnormal rise in the water level in Kaptai Lake following
the heavy downpour and flash flood inundated standing crops on
about 700 hectars of land in eight thanas out of ten in the
district, sources from local Agricult-ure Extension Directorate
said. Water level in the catchment area of Kaptai Lake was recorded
at 91.61 mins sea level (MSL) which is 8.60 MSL higher than the
prescribed level as per rule curve formulated by the Kaptai Lake
Management authority. This month's prescribed water level is 83
MSL.
	   Water level in the Kaptai lake is being maintained by the
Karnaphuli Hydro-Station (KHS) administration on behalf of the
Kaptai Lake Management Authority led by the Divisional Commissioner
of Chittagong Division to generate electricity properly. KHS
discharges water through the spill way to protect the dam which has
blocked the main Karnaphuli river and its flow to use the water
pressure to generate electricity. Influential tribal leader,
ex-chairman of Rangamati Hill District Local Government Council in
a telephonic interview said, if the rule curve is not maintained
properly he will launch a long march to KHS with the affected
people.
	   He, however, urged the KHS authority to maintain the rule curve
as per prescription of Kaptai Lake management authority to protect
the crops of the down-trodden people. Nazrul's birth centenary
observedA two-day long programme to mark the birth centenary of
Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam concluded here at the Tribal Cultural
Institute on May 29. The programme included song and dance
competitions, recitation from the poems of the poet participated by
children and youths.
	   The Rangamati Rotaract Club arran-ged a discussion on the life
and works of Nazrul with president of the club Azad Bulbul in the
chair. The concluding session was followed by a cultural function
participated by the tribal and the non-tribal artistes. Chairman of
RHDLGC, Ching Kue Roaza distributed prizes among the winners as the
chief guest.

	   SING Tao Holdings and Mingly Corporation said in a joint
statement yesterday that discussions which may or may not lead to a
general offer for the shares of Sing Tao by Mingly are continuing.
	   An earlier agreement for Mingly and Sing Tao chairman Sally Aw
Sian to set up a new company that will buy Miss Aw's shares was not
completed yesterday and has been terminated.
	   Yesterday's statement said preliminary discussions were also
taking place between Miss Aw and other independent third parties in
relation to a possible sale of part or all of her shares in Sing
Tao.
	   Miss Aw owns over 50 per cent of Sing Tao shares.
	   Mingly entered into a conditional agreement with Miss Aw on 20
May to establish a new company for the purpose of acquiring Miss
Aw's entire stake in Sing Tao.
	   If the agreement had been completed, the new company would have
had to make a mandatory cash offer at $1.76 per share for the
remaining shares in Sing Tao.
	   Sing Tao company secretary Seaman Kwok said: ``Mingly and Miss
Aw are in discussions to explore ways, subject to compliance with
the code of takeovers and mergers, in particular Rule 31 thereof,
in which the commercial terms previously agreed between them might
be revised.'' He added that the two parties had yet to reach
agreement in this regard.
	   Trading in Mingly shares resumes today, while shares in Sing Tao
will remain suspended pending further announcement.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Thousands of customers of Bank Central Asia (BCA)
flocked to branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) throughout
the city yesterday and queued for hours to withdraw their money.
	   The run on BCA trailed several days of heavy withdrawals from
the country's largest private bank, which is owned by the widely
diversified Salim Group and children of former president Soeharto.
	   Yesterday's run was also prompted by the government's
announcement Thursday that the bank had been placed under the
control of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
	   The Jakarta Post observed BCA branches in Jatinegara, East
Jakarta; Matraman, Slipi and Sudirman, Central Jakarta and Melawai
in South Jakarta, which were all swamped by customers from 8 a.m.
	   A woman who fainted at BCA Sudirman was assisted by security
officers and allowed to rest in one of the offices.
	   Some customers admitted queuing before 6 a.m. for a head start
on the crowds.
	   ``I came here (to BCA Matraman) about 5:40 a.m. It was still
quiet. But a few minutes later people started coming and the
security officers told us to stand in line,'' Rachmiaty. S., an
employee of a private firm who skipped work yesterday, said.
	   She said she would try to withdraw all her money and deposit it
in one of the state banks.
	   ``I work hard for my money. It's about Rp 4 million in total.
Maybe it sounds small to other people but it's worth a lot for
me.''
	   Randita Pramudya, a customer at BCA Slipi, said he was
disappointed with the service.
	   ``They closed the doors about 10 a.m.. We were forced to wait
outside.''
	   Queues of people in front of BCA ATMs have become a daily scene
here over the last few days after massive student protests, which
resulted in former president Soeharto's resignation.
	   There were people who came to terminate their accounts and there
were also others who only wanted to withdraw money for basic
expenses.
	   ``I haven't paid my mobile phone bill, my credit cards ... and I
don't have any money left,'' Gunawan, a resident of Tegalan,
Matraman, said.
	   ``If people keep on coming like this, I'm afraid BCA could
collapse. I personally believe that the government would not
abandon BCA customers. As you know, BCA is the largest bank here.
	   ``But the lining up and the run has started to get on my
nerves,'' the father of four said.
	   Yustika Indriyani, a small vendor in Jatinegara, had a similar
experience.
	   ``I put money in the bank because I thought that it would be
safe. But who would have thought about this ... Well I'd better
just keep the money under the bed like I used to,'' she said, using
a newspaper to shade her head.
	   She said BCA customers were no longer high-class members of
society.
	   ``I saw all of my friends here ... they are all common people.
There's Pak Trisuji, an ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver near my
place,'' she said, waving.
	   BCA claimed 122 of its offices were damaged during the massive
rioting two weeks ago, including 17 of which where set on fire.
Dozens of its ATM facilities were also attacked by angry mobs
during the riots on May 14, dubbed Gray Thursday.
	   In a move to bolster confidence in the bank, BCA president
Abdullah Ali called a snap media conference Sunday to inform the
public that BCA's shareholders were still committed to the bank, as
was Bank Indonesia, the central bank.
	   BCA is owned by the Salim Group, which retains a 70 percent
majority stake and Soeharto's son Sigit Hardjojudanto and daughter
Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, who hold the remaining 30 percent.
	   ``The bank will operate normally since Bank Indonesia has
guaranteed all deposits, including those at BCA,'' he said.
	   But his words did little to calm people's fears. People are
already too traumatized by the chaos and simply fear they will lose
their money.
	   ``We need to keep cash. This country is falling apart. What is
left for little people like us?'' Yustika asked.

Police plan to review cooperation with Tutut, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): The National Police will review its cooperation
agreement with a company belonging to Siti ``Tutut'' Hardijanti
Rukmana whose dealings it claims are riddled with corruption and
nepotism.
	   The police signed the five-year accord in 1992 with PT Citra
Permata Persada (PT CPP), which is owned by the eldest daughter of
former president Soeharto, to administer applications for driver's
licenses.
	   National Police Commander Gen. Dibyo Widodo said Thursday the
review was prompted by reports that the administrative fee for a
license was excessively high and the company had raked in huge
profits.
	   A reliable police source said the company's official
administrative fee was set at Rp 52,500 (US$5.20) for each driver's
license but only Rp 4,500 went to the state coffers.
	   ``But, as you know, in practice the fee is much higher.''
	   According to the source, there has never been a transparent
breakdown of the fee and the accord is still effective although it
expired a year ago.
	   ``We will thoroughly review the cooperation as part of the
burning spirit to wipe out nepotism, collusion and corruption
within the police force,'' Dibyo said.
	   The National Police signed the contract with PT CPP as part of
its efforts to improve public services. Under the agreement, the
company was to help the police provide better equipment and service
in processing driver's licenses.
	   But the promised facilities have never been supplied, the source
said.
	   ``All of the equipment was acquired by the police. They never
spent a penny. This is crazy. Therefore we call for an open review
and investigation into the matter.''
	   The source noted that Jakarta Police Headquarters issues between
2,500 and 3,000 driver's licenses every day.
	   ``The police only get between Rp 11 million and Rp 14 million.
The rest of the money goes into PT CPP's accounts in Bank
International Indonesia (BII), which was appointed as the fee
receiver,'' he said.
	   BII is a subsidiary of the widely diversified Sinar Mas Group,
owned by tycoon Eka Tjipta Widjaja.
	   ``We suspect there is collusion between PT CPP and Sinar Mas
Group because a relative of Eka Tjipta, Jimmy, is the managing
director of PT CPP,'' the source said.
	   When contacted by reporters, Sinar Mas Group spokeswoman Joyce
A., said Wednesday that she was unaware of the situation.
	   ``All I know is that BII has been assigned to keep the money
from driver's license fees. But I have no idea where the money goes
to.
	   ``I only know that Pak Jimmy is a friend of Mbak Tutut. But I
really don't know more than that.''

	   WHEELOCK said yesterday it had put 70 more units in Block A of
its Galaxia project in Diamond Hill up for sale at an average price
of $4,955 per square foot, the same price as the previous launch.
	   ``The flats sale response has been very encouraging, so we
decided to put another 70 units in block A for sale at the same
price of $4,955 per square foot,'' the company said.
	   Last month, Wheelock slashed prices in Galaxia to $4,955 per
square-foot, compared with an average price of $6,198 per square
foot in February.
	   Wheelock has sold 900 units at Galaxia since the first batch was
sold late last year.
	   Most of the 178 units in block C, D, E, put up for sale in a
second offering in May, were sold before flats in block A were put
for up sale.
	   ``There have been lots of transactions for Galaxia, but no
statistics about the exact number of transactions are ready yet,''
Sandia Lau, senior associate director of Centaline Property, said.
	   Ms Lau said more than twenty transactions were registered for
the development last weekend.
	   The development comprises a total of 1,648 residential units.
	   Wheelock's shares dropped 15 cents, or 2.8 per cent to end at
$5.25 yesterday.
	   Meanwhile, Wheelock chairman Gonzaga Li announced yesterday the
appointment of Paul Tsui, Doreen Lee and Harry Wong as main board
members.
	   Wharf, Wheelock's principal associated company, also announced
the appointment of K H Leung, Quinn Law and T Y Ng as main board
members.

Deputies question extent of immunity after lawmaker crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A high-speed car wreck leads to the death
of a young woman. The police say the driver refuses a request for a
legally mandated alcohol test.
	   But instead of handcuffs clicking shut, the driver ties the
hands of justice by claiming parliamentary immunity.
	   Conservative deputy Constantinos Karaminas' alleged refusal to
take a breathalyzer test after a fatal car crash early Monday has
sparked a wider debate on the need to reform a law shielding
legislators from prosecution.
	   ``Politicians are equal to citizens before the law,'' left-wing
deputy Stella Alfieri told the daily Ethnos on Tuesday. ``This
theory of immunity has to stop sometime. Otherwise this is not a
democracy.''
	   In Greece, like many countries, parliament members have
protection from any type of prosecution in order to shield them
against politically motivated charges.
	   But following a rash of incidents, critics now say immunity is
being abused.
	   Karaminas, 50, suffered bruises after crashing into three parked
cars after leaving a nightclub. Passenger Elli Pilidou, a
26-year-old teacher, was killed.
	   Police said Karaminas, a member of the New Democracy opposition
party, claimed immunity when he refused to the breath test. The
deputy later told reporters he did not understand what the police
officer was asking.
	   Under Greek law, breath or blood tests to trace alcohol levels
are obligatory for any driver involved in an accident resulting in
injury or death.
	   ``I will ask for my parliamentary immunity to be lifted,''
Karaminas told Athens' daily Ta Nea. ``I respect parliament and its
institutions.''
	   But parliament very rarely lifts immunity.
	   Ioannis Varvitsiotis, a New Democracy deputy who wants the law
changed, predicted the 300-member parliament will close ranks
around Karaminas and refuse to allow his prosecution.
	   ``Immunity exists in all constitutions of the world, but other
parliaments which respect themselves don't allow their deputies to
hide behind it without reason,'' he said.
	   Since the 1974 fall of the military dictatorship, parliament has
dealt with more than 630 immunity cases. Only in three cases were
deputies stripped of their immunity: on charges of bribery, fraud
and aiding a drug dealer.
	   ``There is one thing Karaminas could do,'' said deputy and
former New Democracy leader Miltiades Evert. ``Resign
immediately.''

	   AMOCO Orient Petroleum Company, a unit of New York-listed Amoco
Corp, seeks buyers for its 24.5 per cent working interest in the
Liuhua oilfield, the largest modern oilfield discovered in the
South China Sea.
	   The oilfield is owned by a joint venture set up to own and
manage the oilfield. The tie-up also includes the Chinese National
Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC), which holds a 51 per cent stake, and a US
oil company, Kerrmcgee, with a 24.5 per cent stake.
	   The total investment cost for the Liuhua field is US$654 million
(HK$5.1 billion).
	   Liuhua is Amoco's only upstream oil and gas production asset in
China. The move to sell the shares is due in part to an ongoing
review of Amoco's worldwide exploration and production portfolio,
said Don Barker, spokesman for the company.
	   Amoco's operations on the mainland are focused principally on
petrochemicals, including construction of a US$300 million
petrochemical facility in Zhuhai.
	   The Liuhua field, brought on stream in 1996, was the largest
oilfield so far discovered in the South China Sea.
	   It was developed using award-winning highly innovative
technology.
	   This includes the use of floating production and storage vessels
and the use of advanced electrical submersible pump systems.

	   Patients suffer for want of doctorsFENI, June 1: Lack of
accommodation and required number of doctors has been putting
patients at the Noakhali General Hospital in a sorry plight.
Hospital sources said, the 100-bed hospital has to provide
treatments to some 350 to 400 indoor patients.
	   Doctors feel that the hospital should be upgraded to a 250-bed
one so as to accommodate the growing number of patients. Four out
of eight posts for eye specialists, medicine specialists,
orthopaedics and consultants are currently lying vacant, causing
suffering to the patients.
	   Patients allege that they are being served low quality diets.
They further say that the environment of the hospital has already
become polluted as there is no proper drainage system around the
place.

Walesa would consider presidential run in 2000 to oust Kwasniewski 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Solidarity founder and former president
Lech Walesa said Tuesday he would considering running for president
in 2000 if no one else appears capable of beating President
Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, defeated Walesa's 1995 bid for
re-election.
	   Walesa told The Associated Press in a phone interview that he
was not announcing his candidacy. But he said he would run if he
felt people were dissatisfied with the pace of reform and
``unanimously'' signaled that they wanted him to speed it up.
	   Kwasniewski has had trouble sharing power with the new
Solidarity-dominated parliament elected last September. Though the
ex-communists and Solidarity politicians often both agree on
reforms, ideological differences and years of history as foes has
hampered cooperation between the political camps.
	   Walesa has not run for office since failing to win a second
term, although he helped campaign for the bloc of Solidarity
parties in last year's parliamentary elections.
	   Walesa founded the Solidarity pro-democracy movement that helped
force the communist regime from power, and then led the successor
political movement established under the democratic system until he
was elected president in 1990.
	   He founded a new political party, the Christian Democracy of
Poland, after the last parliamentary elections. The party so far
has not been a visible presence.

EU criticizes US quota on wheat gluten imports from Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Tuesday
denounced the U.S. decision to limit imports of EU wheat gluten
over a three-year period and warned of retaliation.
	   The quota, ``represents a major restriction on European
exports,'' the EU executive Commission said in a statement.
	   ``This action is all the more surprising coming from a
government that only two weeks ago was calling on WTO members to
further liberalize trade in agricultural products.''
	   The EU head office was considering ``appropriate responses'' but
gave no immediate details.
	   EU spokesman Gerard Kiely said the quota suggested Washington
will defend free farm trade if that serves American farmers only.
	   The EU has nabbed 30 percent of the American wheat gluten
market. Kiely said that was because wheat prices in Europe are
lower than corn prices, whereas the reverse is true in the United
States.
	   EU officials said high imports of EU wheat gluten into the
United States had been predicted for years and said they were
``astonished this evidence was ignored'' for so long. They termed
the U.S. quota unfair, especially since other exporters, such as
Canada, have been exempted from it.
	   On Monday, President Clinton signed off on a three-year quota on
imported wheat gluten. He followed a recommended to that effect,
issued in March, by the U.S. International Trade Commission.
	   The quota will be 126 million pounds in the first year, rising
by 6 percent annually.
	   Each year the U.S. industry consumes 22 million bushels of
wheat, worth about dlrs 100 million. Two billion tons of wheat
flour yield 300 million pounds of gluten annually.
	   Wheat gluten is the natural protein portion of the grain. It
adds protein to breakfast cereals, pet food, livestock feed and
helps whole-grain breads rise.
	   The wheat gluten debate is yet another transatlantic trade
dispute.
	   Only last week, the two sides wrangled over a 30,000-ton
shipment of subsidized Finnish barley that landed on U.S. soil. The
United States announced it would start subsidizing barley exports.
	   This year, the United States introduced poultry export subsidies
after the EU imposed restrictions on US poultry imports.

	   FUND manager Templeton has increased its weightings on Hong Kong
stocks in recent weeks despite a sharp drop in the Hang Seng Index,
emerging markets guru Mark Mobius said.
	   The managing director of Templeton Asset Management Limited said
he likes the local stocks.
	   ``We are beginning to see value here after a downturn, we have
increased our weightings in Hong Kong stocks,'' said Mr Mobius, who
manages more than US$12 billion (HK$93.6 billion) in assets in
emerging markets.
	   Mr Mobius said that property and banking blue chips on the Hong
Kong stockmarket could be picked up at bargain prices.
	   ``We are obviously looking at banks and property stocks and in
some cases smaller stocks of small manufacturers,'' he said.
	   Templeton's Asian Growth Fund, which has a fund size of US$46.61
million, has 15 per cent of its portfolio in the Hong Kong stock
market.
	   Templeton has invested 3.6 per cent in HSBC Holdings, while it
has 2.6 per cent in Hang Lung Development and 2.5 per cent in Li
Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings.
	   Over the last three months the Asian Growth Fund has risen 7.99
per cent, but over the last year the fund has gone down almost
45.89 per cent.
	   ``We have a long-term view on the Hong Kong market and now even
more so compared to other markets,'' Mr Mobius said.
	   He added that the Hong Kong market would remain sluggish for
some time yet.
	   ``Usually when you have bulls and bears fighting, as you have
seen here, people are not panicked to the extent that they want to
dump their shares and then there are people coming in the market
who want to pay lower prices because the market is down, so this
kind of a stand-off can last for a while, which can make markets
move in either direction,'' Mr Mobius said.
	   The Hong Kong market could slide further, he said and added, ``I
see the index at 8,500 by the end of the year''.
	   Mr Mobius said among all the regional markets, Thailand offered
the best value.
	   ``Thailand of course is the most interesting, they are pulling
out (of recession) faster than other markets,'' he said.

	   HOPEWELL Holdings yesterday announced that the number of
vehicles using the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway it opened in
1984 reached 80 million during the weekend.
	   ``This is a big milestone for us and we are delighted that
traffic flows continue to increase steadily on the Superhighway,''
Hopewell chairman Gordon Wu said.
	   Mr Hopewell reported that as of April 1998 an average of 74,000
vehicles per day use the Superhighway.
	   Traffic has increased steadily from 38,000 vehicles a day in
1994 to the current rate.
	   ``When you have a highway linking cities with huge populations,
like Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, it is guaranteed to be a
success in the long-term, which is what we promised our
shareholders,'' Mr Wu said.
	   ``Eventually, the amount of traffic using the highway will
increase when restrictions are lifted on private vehicles from Hong
Kong driving into the mainland.
	   ``If Hong Kong's future is linked to the mainland, then you must
be able to drive there. I will be working over the coming months to
raise this issue with the appropriate authorities,'' Mr Wu said,
The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Superhighway runs for 123 kilometres through
the heavily populated towns and cities on the eastern side of the
Pearl River Delta.
	   In total, Hopewell operates and has interests in more than 350
kilometres of toll roads in Guangdong province.
	   Mr Wu said earlier that given the current market situation, the
group would proceed cautiously with its current projects and focus
on maintaining sound liquidity.

Protesting Roma sets himself ablaze in Bulgaria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A member of the Roma minority in northern
Bulgaria set himself on fire Tuesday after two weeks on a hunger
strike protesting poverty and unpaid social benefits.
	   The 37-year-old man from the town of Lom, 200 kilometers (125
miles) north of the capital Sofia, suffered only slight injuries,
as a fire brigade instantly put out the flames.
	   The man is among 17 gypsies, or Roma, who have been on a hunger
strike for two weeks in a tent camp in front of town hall,
demanding that the municipality repay leva 400 million (dlrs
224,000) of outstanding social assistance to local Roma, state
radio said.
	   Public Administration Minister Mario Tagarinski arrived for
talks with the protesters after they threatened that each hour one
of them would set himself on fire to attract government attention.
	   While talks went on, some 200 Roma crowded in front of the town
hall chanting: ``We want bread.''
	   The protesters have complained that local companies refuse to
employ Roma, who comprise a third of Lom's population of 36,000.
	   Roma number about 300,000 in Bulgaria's population of 8.5
million. Unemployment is above 50 percent among the Roma, who also
have the highest crime rate among social groups.

German chancellor quashes speculation about presidency 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday he
wants to keep speculation about who will be Germany's next
president out of this year's election campaign.
	   Incumbent Roman Herzog is retiring from the largely ceremonial
post in May after a five-year term, and newspapers reported last
weekend that the Christian Democrats would nominate prominent
eastern German politician Kurt Biedenkopf to replace him.
	   Kohl's party views the move as a way to woo eastern voters for
the Sept. 27 federal election, the reports said.
	   But Kohl denied the accounts about Biedenkopf, the popular
governor of Lower Saxony state, as ``freely fabricated.''
	   ``The current debate about the office of the president is
unacceptable,'' he said in a statement.
	   Nominally above politics, the German president is often
considered the nation's conscience. He is elected by a session of
both houses of parliament.
	   Kohl accused the opposition Social Democrats of triggering an
``unseemly spectacle'' by talking up a possible candidate of their
own, Johannes Rau.
	   Rau governed North-Rhine Westphalia, the nation's most populous
state, for two decades until making way for a younger successor
last month. Kohl asserted Rau stepped down only after the Social
Democrats promised to nominate him for president.

	   BANKS yesterday showed keen interest in the new Hong Kong dollar
repurchase mechanism designed to increase liquidity in the banking
system.
	   Standard Chartered Bank regional treasurer Stanley Y F Wong said
the bank was getting lots of inquiries about the new repurchase
facility since it was announced as one of seven measures to boost
the economy.
	   From yesterday, the banks acting as market-markers for the
repurchase facility agreed to offer quotations for one-month,
two-month, three-month, and six-month debt papers for a minimum $20
million and a maximum $200 million.
	   This means that corporate borrowers holding debt paper eligible
for the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) _ the rediscount window
managed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority _ can offer the debt
papers to the market-making banks as collateral for loans from $20
million to $200 million with one-month, two-month, three-month, and
six-month maturities.
	   Before the introduction of the new repurchase facility, only
Exchange Fund bills were allowed to be used as collateral through
the repurchase facility.
	   With the LAF paper as collateral, borrowers can get the cash
from the market-making banks including: HongkongBank, Standard
Chartered Bank, Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, Dao Heng Bank, and
Bank of East Asia.
	   When the loan matures, the borrower pays the creditor bank the
cash it borrowed plus interest and gets back it's LAF debt paper.

Hanson claims Aborigines want money, not reconciliation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Maverick legislator Pauline Hanson on
Tuesday accused Aboriginal people of seeking compensation from
white Australia, not reconciliation.
	   The controversial leader of the One Nation Party launched a
tirade against indigenous people during debate on the government's
budget bills in Parliament's main committee.
	   She also attacked a U.N. declaration supporting indigenous
peoples' rights, claiming it would take power from the majority of
Australians and place it in the hands of ``self-seeking
minorities.''
	   ``We are witnesses to the ongoing campaign not aimed at
reconciliation but at remuneration,'' she said.
	   She said the indigenous population was experiencing boom growth
in Australia. Aborigines make up some 380,000 of the nation's 18
million people.
	   Some welfare programs are reserved for Aborigines, as others are
aimed at refugees, disaster victims or drought-ridden farmers.
Aborigines as a group are Australia's poorest and least healthy
people, with the highest infant mortality and shortest average life
span.

Public sector allocation for tourism development curtailed in the Fifth Plan, THE INDEPENDENT

	   Successive Governments have always praised the tourism industry
because of the benefits that the country can derive through
promotion and development of tourism and they promised enhanced
allocation for the sector. But the Fifth Five Year Plan (1997-2002)
which has been announced already indicates that allocation for
tourism development has been curtailed.The fifth five year plan has
an allocation of Taka 312 crore for tourism development.
	   Out of this allocation Taka 12 crore will be provided by the
government for implementation of plans in the public sector and the
remaining Taka 300 crore have been allocated for the private
sector. Compared to this, the public sector allocation for tourism
in the 4th Plan was Taka 25 crore and the private sector allocation
stood at Taka 200 crore. The public sector allocation during the
3rd Five Year Plan was Taka 12 crore.
	   In other words, the public sector allocation, after 2 Plan
periods, stands at the same scale, despite the fact that the value
of Taka has gone down by 33 per cent during the period. It is to be
noted here that the public sector allocation for tourism
development in the country is used for plans implemented by the
Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation. The private sector allocation is
not a direct expenditure from the government fund.
	   It is a kind of indirect support for encouraging the private
sector through tax incentive, bank loans, land allotment, etc.
During the 4th Plan, Taka 200 crore were earmarked for the private
sector. But neither the Ministry of Civil Aviation  Tourism nor
the Parjatan Corporation has any idea as to how much of this
allocation has been used by the private sector in the form of tax
incentive, bank loan and land allotment.
	   Due to heavy taxes, such as VAT, surcharge and service charge, a
resident in any respectable hotel in Bangladesh has to pay nearly
32 per cent of his total bill as taxes and duties. This is highest
tax collected by any country in the SAARC region. This acts as an
disincentive to the growth of tourism in Bangladesh and its hotel
industry. As during the 4th Plan no tax incentive to tourism
industry was provided, nobody really knows what will happen to the
private sector allocation of Taka 300 crore during the 5th Plan
period.
	   It is common knowledge now that the 5th Plan was finalised in a
hot haste without proper consultation, survey and research. Even
the Ministry of Finance did not have the opportunity to have a
thorough look at the draft 5th Plan, according to reliable source.
Some insiders say that the tourism allocation for the 5th Plan was
done arbitrarily without consulting the executing agency.
	   In the meantime, the Land Ministry, which allocates land for
hotels and motels, has revised its policy in May this year. In this
revised policy the Civil Aviation and Tourism Ministry is just a
recommending body which is not the case in some of the neighbouring
countries where the authority for final allocation of land for
tourist establishment in declared tourist areas lies with the
Tourist Board or with the Ministry of Tourism.However, in the above
scenario, the 5th Plan aims at achieving the following goals for
tourism development: Tourism sites will be developed in
collaboration with other sectors such as transport and
communication, hotels, motels and catering establishment, etc.
Tourism facilities will be created in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,
coastal areas, border districts, etc. More 4 and 5 Star hotels will
be set up in Dhaka and Chittagong. Private sector/NGOs will be
encouraged to develop and run tourism sites and other facilities;
Low cost tourism facilities will be developed for the domestic
tourists; Special facilities will be created for expatriates
working in the Export Processing Zone; One or two coastal islands
will be leased to private enterprises for development as tourists
resorts; The Tourism Training Institute will be expanded.

<TEXT>
	   NEW Aspiration Party has begun beating its war drum much sooner
than expected -- even before the House passed three organic laws
that will set the stage for a general election under a new system,
as required by the new Constitution.
	   NAP has named 12 chieftains for electoral regions, with the
northeast, its electoral power base, designated a top priority for
victory. The party, whose political wounds have yet to heal, is
gunning for another triumph and a return to government.
	   NAP leader Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh sounds more confident these
days as cracks have begun to appear in the popularity of the
Democrats, whose struggle to effect an economic rescue has received
less-than-thunderous applause.
	   It might be too soon, however, for NAP to expect an election
victory over the Democrats, whose fate could depend on economic
events that will unfold over the next three months. So far, the
present trend is not very encouraging at all.
	   There is a new political equation. Thaksin Shinawatra has
decided to form his own political party. The telecom tycoon has a
huge war chest to match his ambitions, but whether he is willing to
invest in a place on the stage out of his own pocket remains to be
seen.
	   Yet, Thaksin represents greener pastures for many young NAP
politicians, who believe that the ex-leader of Palang Dharma Party
has stronger selling points than Chavalit, whose stature was badly
shaken during his 11-month premiership -- so much so that his name
has become synonymous with the current economic turmoil.
	   Chavalit's political wounds are deep and hard to heal. His
failures have been hashed over time and again during House debates,
yet the former army chief believes the people who will decide his
fate are the northeasterners, and their support for his party is as
strong as ever.
	   NAP is fragmenting due to factional rivalries. Its MPs, hoping
to preserve their good names, might want to jump ship and Thaksin's
party will provide a tempting alternative, no matter how much hype
the big-time businessman kicks up.
	   The Thaksin factor could also affect Chat Pattana and other
parties finding it difficult to exist under the new electoral
system. Chalerm Yoobamrung has dissolved his Muan Chon Party to
become a big fish in NAP's big pond.
	   NAP heavyweights and key lieutenants also believe that the next
three months could change the mood of the voters if Prime Minister
Chuan and his team fail to perform up to the public's expectations.
That could mean a good opportunity for NAP to work out a new
alliance and deal a blow to the Democrats.
	   Yet, NAP does not seem to want a general election now. Major
players in other parties have said on record that Chuan can choose
an appropriate time for voters to go to the polling booths.
Everybody is afraid to be in government right now. The underlying
belief is: ''If the Democrats can't do it, who can?'' Some MPs even
suggested that if Chuan feels that it is too much for his team to
carry on he should resign and let somebody else succeed him instead
of dissolving the House and calling a snap election.
	   Some NAP young guns and foot soldiers raised a feeble cry for
Chuan to let the people decide the country's fate through a new
election, but they weren't backed by party chieftains, who would
rather wait for the Democrats to lose their shine, as well as their
sting.
	   Fortunately for voters, more time is need for the government to
lay the groundwork for the new electoral system. It's a big change
for politicians as MPs will no longer be able to become Cabinet
members, making House seats less attractive than before.
	   Those who believe they have sufficient clout and fame want to be
on a party list so they can take ministerial portfolios. NAP's best
strategy at the moment is to seize on any missteps the Chuan
Cabinet makes and let the public know all about them.
	   Chavalit and his lieutenants are aware that even if they can
form a coalition, the question of broad-based public acceptance
cannot be dealt with easily, not to mention acceptance by the
international community, which has influence on the country's
economic direction.
	   Being in government could mean a march towards another downfall,
particularly as there are indications that a second economic
meltdown is lurking around the corner, this time involving giants
like Japan and China.
	   NAP's war drum has not struck a resonating beat. Chat Pattana
has yet to decide who will replace the late Gen Chatichai
Choonhavan -- a subject which will also dictate the party's future.
	   The immediate effect is a muffling of the drum by the hype of
Thaksin, who is sounding out many well-known figures to join his
camp. To a certain extent it could cause uncertainty for those
looking to defect from NAP, whose own war chest remains impressive.
The plain message is that there is plenty of meat left on the bone
for all who decide to stay.
	   Calls for a new election will continue to come from
public-pressure groups, which have been saying that the crusade to
rescue the economy should not provide an excuse for the Chuan
government to delay polling.
	   Chuan must not call an election merely on the basis that he
wants the people to decide a new government. That's too easy an
excuse to escape the pressing responsibilities. There is only
choice left for him -- he has to succeed in the present economic
rescue attempts. Anything else is insignificant.
	   There is no urgency to change horses in mid-stream. As the
public sees it, those floating around are either dead or wounded
led by an old campaigner who himself looks half dead -- if not
actually dead --politically.

Cameroon chooses final World Cup squad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Cameroon announced Tuesday its final
World Cup squad, including some veterans and a new generation of
attackers _ and few surprises.
	   An expected omission from the team is Marc Vivien Foe, a
standout midfielder with French champion Lens, who broke his leg in
training in late May during the buildup to the World Cup.
	   Unexplained in his absence, however, was Tockene Bertin, a
defender expected to be a starter for the Indomitable Lions.
	   Veteran goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o, who plays for Deportivo La
Coruna in Spain, will anchor the team along with striker Francois
Omam-Biyick of Sampdoria in Italy.
	   Key young faces include attackers Alphonse Tchami of Hertha
Berlin in Germany and Salomon Olembe of Nantes in France.
	   The Cameroonian squad is believed weaker than its predecessor
that shocked the soccer fraternity by playing to the quarterfinals
of the 1990 World Cup.
	   Roster  
	   Goalkeepers: Jacques Songo'o, William Andem, Alioume Boukar.
	   Defenders: Rigobert Song, Joseph Elanga, Raymond Kalla Kongo,
Pierre Wome Nlend, Pierre Djanka, Pensee Dillon, Serge-Flavian
Kwetche.
	   Midfielders: Augustine Simo, Joseph-Cyrille Ndo, Patrick M'Boma,
Didier Angebeaud Nguidjol, Samuel Eto'o, Salomon Olembe.
	   Attackers: Francois Omam-Biyack, Lauriano Etame Mayer, Samuel
Ipoua, Marcel Mahoube, Joseph Desiree Job, Alphonse Tchami.

Williams, Majoli out at French Open 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Williams losing, Davenport victory
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Venus Williams, who powered her way through the
first four rounds of the French Open, met her match Tuesday in
top-seeded Martina Hingis, losing 6-3, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
	   But Williams' compatriot, No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport, moved
into the semis with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 victory over defending champion
Iva Majoli.
	   Hingis used her deft touch and clever court sense to run
Williams down. She almost always seemed in control, never looking
off balance or rushed.
	   Hingis raced to a 3-0 lead, but Williams broke her in the fifth
game for 3-2 as Hingis twice double-faulted. Hingis then broke
right back for 4-2, and held on to win the set.
	   In the second set, Williams had a chance to break Hingis for
2-0, racking up three break points. But Hingis won five straight
points to take the game.
	   In the crucial game of the set, Hingis broke Williams for 4-3 _
again on two double faults, this time by Williams.
	   Also reaching the semifinals was Aranxta Sanchez Vicario, the
No. 4 seed, who advanced with a three-set win over Patty Schnyder
of Switzerland.
	   The two-time champion lost a tiebreak in the second set but
coasted through the third for a 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), 6-0 victory.
	   But another former champion, Thomas Muster, continued a
disappointing year with a quarterfinal loss to Felix Mantilla of
Spain, the No. 15 seed, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
	   Muster has seen his ranking drop in the past year from ninth to
22nd.
	   Williams was playing so well at this year's French Open that the
match between her and Hingis had been seen as worthy of the final.
	   But Hingis wasn't ready to call Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
says. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.''
	   ``I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically to Hingis' comments.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Statistically speaking, the two have had an almost identical run
through the early rounds here. Hingis has lost just 14 games while
averaging 56 minutes per victory. Williams has lost 13 games and
averaged 58 minutes per match.
	   But stylistically speaking, they are totally different.
	   Hingis has a masterful touch, moving opponents around the court
with precise groundstrokes. Williams is pure power.
	   Marat Safin, an 18-year-old qualifier, used his power to carve
his way through the first three rounds. His tournament ended on
Monday, however, in five tough sets.
	   The French fans chanted wildly for his opponent, Frenchman
Cedric Pioline. ``Allez Cedric!'' they yelled.
	   But as the match wore on, there were growing chants of ``Ma-RAT!
Ma-RAT!''
	   It was in tribute to the remarkable run by the young Russian
playing his first Grand Slam event. He began the tournament ranked
116th in the world, but won't be there much longer.
	   ``I think I can beat good players now,'' he said after Pioline
ended his run 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Safin's tournament started with three qualifying matches just to
get into the main draw.
	   Next up was Andre Agassi, in the midst of a strong comeback.
Safin, however, had the answer to every problem Agassi presented.
Then he ousted defending champion Gustavo Kuerten, ranked eighth in
the world, in another five-setter.
	   In the third round, Safin had a slightly easier time _ needing
only four sets to beat Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   That set up the match with Pioline. The 28-year-old Frenchman is
erratic, but brilliant on occasion. He has reached the finals of
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, both times losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Pioline has a reputation for choking at the end of matches.
Although he has reached 12 singles finals in his career, he has
captured only two titles.
	   Safin knew nothing of that.
	   ``Nobody told me,'' he said.
	   It didn't matter. This time it was Safin who unraveled. Pioline
broke the Russian's serve three times, including once in the fifth
set. That was enough.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina formally launched the government's
old-age allowance programme on Sunday last. The programme,
initiated by the government to redeem the ruling party's
commitment, aims at paying a monthly allowance of Taka 100 to over
four lakh people all over the country. It is indeed a significant
development, since no such move had ever been made in the past to
provide pecuniary help to the poor old men and women.
	   The beginning, modest though, reflects the realisation on the
part of the decision makers that the old and infirm need to be
taken care of with whatever resources we have. For many, life turns
out to be an unbearable proposition owing to grinding poverty and
poor physical conditions. But they are the same humans who once
worked hard for their families and undertook nation-building
activities. So there is a debt that society owes to them, and it
should be paid back when they are too old to support themselves.
Unfortunately, though elderly people have traditionally been
treated with sympathy and respect in our society, many of them are
now left without any source of income.
	   So the task on our hands is to push the scheme towards its
logical conclusion--- supporting as many old people as possible.
The programme can be further expanded and the monthly allowance
enhanced in future provided it is taken up in all seriousness. It
can be meaningful only when we realise that helping the old is more
than a matter of moral obligation-- it is a sacred responsibility
that we have to shoulder with a sense of gratitude to the senior
citizens. A lot more should to be done to ensure that they do not
slip into a wretched existence in the last few years of their
lives.
	   For example, the number of homes for the old is still hopelessly
inadequate. So an elaborate plan has to be formulated to change the
lot of the old and ignored people. The old-age allowance programme
should provide us with a sense of direction.

	   The city on Sunday witnessed a scene which while being strange
and unprecedented also had a touch of the macabre. We do support
the legitimate demands of all aggrieved sections, and teachers,
especially, have a prior claim to our sympathy. In keeping with
this spirit we would have no hesitation to engage in advocacy of
their cause, to the extent it is just. However, certain matters
relating to their status and situation, qualification, terms of
employment and relationship with the government are not clear to
us.In the first place, city-dwellers are no longer in a mood to
condone blocking of road traffic, by any party or group whatsoever.
	   Secondly, while we have seen countless protests and processions,
rallies and demonstrations, this is for the first time that
processionists have wrapped themselves in shrouds, perhaps either
to highlight their desperation or to draw sympathy. This is, we
think, transgressing the limits of decency and moderation. We only
hope this new trend will not catch on, in which case our
emotionally overcharged socio-political environment will generate
more heat. And the non-government primary school teachers resorted
to this frantic course for a cause no more universal than
improvement of their own service prospects.
	   Excess, even of emotional kind, elicits not sympathy but
contempt. We wonder who organised this unseemly spectacle.If the
non-government primary school teachers want parity in salary with
government primary school teachers, the question of qualification
and training is relevant. (At present HSC and completion of a brief
training course are mandatory for job in a government primary
school). The non-government primary teachers are working under a
bilateral agreement with their respective employers and the
government is not a party to that arrangement.
	   What actually happens is that local enthusiasts open a school
with inadequate preparation and also manage to get a registration,
and then expect the government to assume full responsibility for
it. We think there should be no wholesale government takeover and
each case should be considered on merit, especially in relation to
performance.

	   An earthquake struck northern Afghanistan on Saturday. More than
5,000 people are feared dead, probably buried under landslides and
the ruins of their village homes. Figures of the injured exceed
1,000 and it is feared the toll may rise further. Last February an
earthquake in this area left 2,300 dead and thousands homeless.
	   Aid workers and relief agencies who were working in this region
on that occasion should be able to utilise their experience in
providing relief to this inaccessible mountainous place. The
nearest airport at Faisalabad, already in use for relief to the
war-ravaged country, can be the jumping-off base for the
internationally sponsored effort to give succour to the
quake-affected region. Though planes have provided preliminary
supplies, the weather is not favourable because of overcast
conditions and falling rain.
	   Perhaps planes without landing can drop relief goods, medicine,
tents, plastic sheeting and other disaster fighting materials since
the need of the distressed cannot wait for any tomorrow.The
earthquake region is in anti-Taliban alliance territory. On
humanitarian grounds, there should be a truce declared in
unequivocal terms among all the warring factions so that they may
be able to pool their resources and help the quake victims right
away.
	   The local authorities have appealed for help on an urgent basis.
They are asking the survivors of the more than eight villages which
have been wiped out totally to leave the quake-prone area for its
being too dangerous. People are always reluctant to leave one's
home, however. But it is clear that if the villagers wish to
re-build their homes, they should do so with quake-proof building
material appropriate to their mountain homes.
	   Most important, they will probably have to set up abodes
elsewhere so that landslides do not bury their homes as before.
Afghans it seems have been the prey to their own kind and nature,
suffering the ravages of internecine war, freezing icy winters and
earthquakes in remote regions where the populace perhaps felt safe
from the guns. Peace is positively a required step, otherwise life
will have little meaning to the quake-rehabilitated victims as well
as their fellow citizens.

Report: Japan expected to incur fiscal deficit for 1997 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's state revenues for the 1997 fiscal year are
expected fall short of government spending for the period because
of the flagging economy, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Final statistics for the year will be available only after the
Finance Ministry compiles more recent tax revenue statistics, Kyodo
News reported, citing ministry sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   But tax revenues for the first 11 months of fiscal 1997, at 45.7
trillion yen (dlrs 328.8 billion), accounted for only 81.3 percent
of the government's tax revenue projection, the report said.
	   That means state revenues for the entire fiscal year are certain
to fall short of budgeted government spending, Kyodo reported.
	   Japan is going through its worst economic stagnation in decades,
and the downturn has dented corporate earnings and income taxes,
worsening the government's already troubled finances.
	   The government had projected tax revenues would increase 8
percent over the previous year, but revenues in the first 11 months
of the 1997 fiscal year _ which ended March 31 _ were only up 2.8
percent.

	   KarimPakistan exploded five nuclear devices on the 28th May and
became a nuclear power, the 7th and the latest in the world. It
took no one by surprise, as people had apprehended its
inevitability after India's nuclear explosions two weeks earlier.
The issue was not whether but when Pakistan would detonate a bomb,
as was explained by Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gouhar Ayub.
Pakistan had already acquired the capability of exploding a nuclear
device for some years, but India had actually detonated one as
early as in 1974.
	   The whole world condemned the tests of the two countries, in
varying degrees, though both witnessed a maddening jubilation by
their respective people following the events. Over and above this,
Pakistan made another blast on the 30th May, in a bid to score a
point higher than India in the nuclear race. Why did Pakistan act
in the teeth of heavy opposition throughout the world, especially
the big powers? The major powers, both nuclear and non-nuclear,
sought to dissuade Pakistan from undertaking the action, but in
vain. Their policy of carrot and stick failed to work in this case.
	   The United States, Japan, UK, Germany and such other countries'
offer of material rewards to Pakistan could not deter the latter
from treading the path it had chosen. Nor the fear of the severe
consequences of imposition of sanctions by those countries could
set Pakistan off its track.The official explanation given by
Pakistan related to one of security perception, signifying a threat
from across its eastern borders. The purpose was purely defensive,
stated by the Pakistanis with as much emphasis as the Indians had
stated to justify their own.
	   India's action left Pakistan with no alternative but to take a
similar and possibly, a matching reaction. Any amount of protective
assurances from big powers could not convince Pakistan of the
efficacy of a nuclear umbrella, if it were at all possible.
Besides, the pressure on Nawaz Sharif's government with a popular
demand for Pakistan to go unclear following India's latest tests
was mounting heavily. Many believed that no government in Pakistan
could withstand such a heavy pressure indefinitely. Furthermore,
the need for security was supplemented by a sense of vindication of
national pride of the Pakistani people.
	   And also, the fear of being stung by biting sanctions of aid
donors was to be mitigated by the apparent readiness of the
Pakistani people to undergo severe austerity for this purpose.
Declaration of a state of emergency only testifies to that
determination. Again, Pakistanis were also disappointed by what
they regarded as inadequacy of condemnation of Indian tests and
imposition of ineffectual sanctions on recalcitrant India by
nations and world bodies. Finally, the Pakistan bomb may act as an
effective deterrent to the Indian bomb, as the nuclear stalemate
between the East and the West has, according to many, forestalled
the world from plunging into a Third World War.
	   If these could be advanced as points in favour of Pakistan's
initial action, detonation of a sixth device could hardly be added
to it as any measure of justification.India's initial reaction to
Pakistan tests was mild. Indian leaders appeared to have viewed
Pakistan's reaction almost as a foregone conclusion. They stated
they would put a moratorium on further nuclear tests, agreed to
negotiate about signing of the CTBT which action they had so long
abhorred as discriminatory, and offered to discuss the issue with
Pakistan. Pakistani Prime Minister also stated his readiness to
talk to the Indians about this.
	   This overture from both sides would be most welcome and is,
perhaps, one of the most significant positive developments that has
taken place in this murky episode. On the other hand, Pakistan
Foreign Minister's apprehension about the possibility of Indian
troops to go across the borders or the ceasefire line in Kashmir in
``hot pursuit,'' casts a gloomy pall of shadow in the minds of
many.The nuclear tests of India, no doubt, upset the delicate
balance of power that had precariously existed between India and
Pakistan since their very inception as sovereign independent
states.
	   The balance tipped in favour of India and caused ecstasy in most
quarters in that country, her leaders knowing fully well that
Pakistan, which had already developed nuclear technology, would
follow suit almost immediately. Why then would the government of
India choose to bask in this transitory glory at the risk of
introducing the horror of nuclear peril in the sub-continent? The
so-called danger from the North or from the West is neither
imminent nor real, taking into account positive overtures from the
North and absence of extra-ordinary rattling from the West.
	   It is hard to justify India's action. But, it is harder still
for her people to face some good measure of political isolation and
economic hardship which could better be avoided for the benefit of
all concerned.India and, for that matter, Pakistan both had
attained nuclear capability since many years, but the successive
governments of both countries desisted from developing bombs in
order to avoid a dangerous and resource gorging escalation of
nuclear arms race which the poor people of the two counties can
ill-afford.
	   People wonder, whether it is the oft-repeated declaration of BJP
leaders to glorify India with a nuclear status or a bid to
consolidate unity of a fragile coalition of the government? May be
both, may be some other additional considerations. Whatever may
these have been, it bore ill tidings for the people of this region
and even beyond.Another factor may be discerned from an analysis of
these events in South Asia. It may entail the dangerous possibility
of encouraging actions to promote similar nuclear programmes in
other parts of the globe. The greatest concern of the West in this
connection is not anywhere but in the Middle East.
	   The near nuclear technology attained by Iran, for example, may
be further developed into full nuclear capability in no time, and
this would add to the worries or those who have undertaken the
responsibility of safeguarding peace in that region. To restrain or
punish Iran in the event it decides to go nuclear would not be as
easy as it was for neighbouring Iraq. It may also be interesting
for some to claim Pakistan's bomb as the Islamic bomb, since
Pakistan itself is an Islamic Republic. But it is not regarded as
such, since Pakistan's missile delivery system is not yet braced to
reach the Western part of West Asia. But, it has the potential.
Pakistan has categorically stated that it would continue with its
nuclear programme and fix warheads to the missiles already
developed and to those being developed.
	   India had already announced her intention to induct the bomb on
her missiles. The South Asian nuclear cycle is now complete. The
escalation has commenced. It can be arrested only by the wisdom,
initiative and efforts of the leaders of both India and Pakistan so
as how to face the complex and dangerous situation that has now
evolved. Given sincerity of purpose, only through dialogue between
the parties concerned can the situation be somehow redeemed and
this would help restore the sense of stability and peace that
prevailed in the region and what all peace-loving people aspire
for.

Outgoing premier also stepping down as Socialist Party leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Outgoing Prime Minister Gyula Horn also
plans to step down as the leader of his Socialist Party, a party
vice president said Tuesday.
	   The announcement was made by Magda Kosa Kovacs, after the
party's executive committee met and decided to call a congress in
late August or early September.
	   Horn will not run for re-election as Socialist Party head then,
she said, but will, however, continue to sit in Parliament as a
Socialist deputy.
	   Horn, 65, has led the Socialist-party since 1989, after it split
from the old-line communists, and led them to victory in the 1994
elections.
	   In elections last month, the Socialists were defeated by the
center-right Young Democrats-Civic Party, which won 148 seats, to
the Socialists 134.
	   Young Democrats leader Viktor Orban on Tuesday met President
Arpad Goencz, who indirectly told him he would be asked to form the
next government as head of the party with the most seats.
	   Orban told reporters afterward that he was urged to proceed with
coalition talks.
	   ``We agreed with the president that the interests of the country
dictate that the next government be set up as soon as possible,''
Orban said.
	   Orban has yet to meet with the head of the Independent
Smallholders, Jozsef Torgyan. Torgyan's party won 48 seats and
without his support Orban cannot form the next government.
	   Negotiations, expected to start later in the week, promise to be
tough. Orban last week assured German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that
Hungary remains keenly interested in attracting western
investments. The agrarian-based right-wing Smallholders, however,
view foreign capital with suspicion.

	   The battle between the ''rich'' and the ''poor'' has become
keener, with northeastern MPs in the opposition camp styling
themselves guardians of the poor and joining in the fray. These
politicians hope to gain votes by portraying their adversaries in
government as mean people who only open their hearts to the rich.
	   The debate has become socially divisive and explosive as the
national economy remains in deep crisis. This is a bad time indeed
for most people. It is also the first time in our modern history
when free lunches have been offered daily to the jobless, the poor
and the destitute under the philanthropic programme initiated by
Her Majesty the Queen. It is similar to the soup line provided for
the homeless in the West, especially during the Great Depression.
	   Politicians of the New Aspiration Party, who are mainly from the
poverty-stricken northeast, are making the most out of it. As they
champion the rural poor, they finger the urban rich -- now the
formerly rich -- as the group which benefits most from the present
government-rescue measures. Unscrupulous politicians have no qualms
in driving a wedge between the sensitive layers of society for
their own benefit. They may gain a few additional votes, but in the
end these may not be worth the ensuing conflicts.
	   The outcry over the disparity between the ''rich'' and the
''poor'' by NAP MPs is frequently heard during House debates. They
like it most when the sessions are telecast live, making it sound
as if the northeastern poor would be better off if they were back
in government. However, these MPs are typical pork-barrel
politicians who skim the cream off the budgets allocated for rural
projects. Many of them have set up dummy or front companies to bid
for contracts for public projects owing to their close connections
with local officials and rural community leaders.
	   MPs once enjoyed a Bt20-million slush fund each every fiscal
year for development projects in their constituencies. Nobody ever
questioned them in a serious manner as to how they spent such
money. The fund was really a perk clothed in a nice term so that
the spenders did not have to feel overly embarrassed. While a full
accounting of the money used has yet to be completed to determine
the extent of the projects' true benefits, it would be no surprise
to learn that the poor rural souls never received what had been
meant for them.
	   What is seriously wrong is that the rural folks have never got
the right people as their representatives. If their MPs were as
efficient and caring as they have claimed, the rural poor would not
have to seasonally march to Bangkok, set up camp in front of
Government House and endure all the terrible environment and
suffering of the city.
	   Maybe it is an appropriate time to ask those self-styled
crusaders for the rural poor: who are the formerly rich and the
still rich? Corporate crooks in the finance and banking sector who
have managed to siphon off money for the good life before their
firms collapsed are still rich. They are trying their best to keep
themselves safe from the relatively feeble arm of our law.
	   Families with old wealth which thrive on interest income are not
affected. They stand to be wealthier provided that the institutions
which hold their deposits do not go under. Businessmen who cannot
cope with the harsh conditions of tight liquidity, high interest
rates and failed transactions may be in either the rich or poor
category, depending on what kind of financial lifebuoys they have
prepared for themselves.
	   Salaried people, wage-earners and the self-employed are affected
through reduced income and pay packages. Those already laid off by
their employees to join the swelling unemployment are hardest hit
if they do not have enough savings. Many have to part with homes
and cars through foreclosures and repossession.
	   Most sectors in society have complained about the deteriorating
economic situation, but by profession politicians are blessed with
opportunities to become ever richer. So far there has been just a
token cut in their pay, which is already high by national standards
compared with the number of days they attend House sessions.
	   Remember the notorious northeastern spin doctor whose bank
account showed over Bt3 million but who claimed that Bt1 million
had been borrowed from a friend? The manure-throwing downtrodden at
the rally would never have a chance to lay their hands on that kind
of money in their lifetimes. MPs with ministerial experience stand
to be even richer. None has died a pauper so far except for those
long known for their modest living and lifelong honesty.
	   Parliament, when in session, resembles a motor show where MPs
unabashedly display their wealth. Expensive wines and attire among
well-monied MPs are mind-boggling for the little people they vow to
serve. By professional and House rules, the MPs wear suits, a far
cry from the well-worn and unwashed attire of the poor souls who
rally in front of Government House. These MPs have yet to explain
to the public what category they would be in were their own
financial standings made public. Many northeastern MPs who shed
tears for the poor are actually more affluent than the average
millionaire.
	   Indeed, these campaigners for the poor, by and large, are still
very rich and unaffected by the economic hardships. They are
spoiling for the days when they can exercise the power of their
wealth to lure the gullible to elect them back to the House, no
doubt for further self-enrichment. When poor politicians don't have
their own campaign funds to buy votes, they borrow money from
patrons to fake their wealth and mislead the voters into thinking
that they are financially sound enough to fulfil their campaign
promises if elected.
	   See? They are even rich in lies.

	   Like vultures, international consultancy firms have flocked to
crisis-hit Thailand which is under pressure from foreign creditors
to reform its institutions, policies and management. Yes, the
much-heralded solutions such as good governance, transparency and
accountability cannot simply occur like magic: they need advisory
input.
	   But policy-makers should rethink their consultancy-hiring
policies. They may discover that Thai consultants can do a better
job, and at more competitive fees, than their foreign counterparts.
Where Thailand needs foreign know-how is not in terms of ideas but
in actual management such as implementers, managers, enforcers,
trainers and supervisors.
	   Spearheading much of the consultancy work is the World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, International Monetary Fund and the Thai
government itself. Foreign consultants are now flooding various
ministries. Go to the Finance Ministry on any day and one will find
long queues of foreign consultants, investment bankers and
creditors, all waiting to see the minister, his deputy or
department heads, offering work from consultancy on privatisation,
recapitalisation and reorganisation, international bond issue and
bureaucratic reform to system efficiency management.
	   Many well-known international consultancy firms have set up
offices in Bangkok: McKenzie  Co, Arthur Andersen, Coopers and
Lybrand, Price Waterhouse, Ernst and Young, Booz Allen and so on.
Despite that the government is broke, these firms expect to earn
hefty fees from the restructuring loans extended by the World Bank
and others to the Thai government.
	   The deals are not just being done out of Bangkok but from the
headquarters of these international organisations. Such
organisations have inside information on what consultancy work may
be up for bidding. For instance, the World Bank has cut its
permanent staff in recent years and is now relying on outside
consultancy -- turning it into a global business.
	   If there are merits in using international consultants to help
provide know-how, and to provide systematic planning and
implementation to tackle Thailand's weaknesses as well as upgrading
policy-making and systems to international standards, that is fine.
But in many instances, it's not the case.
	   There is also a growing chorus within Thailand that foreign
consultancies are taking many Thai agencies, and therefore
taxpayers, for a ride by overcharging, taking advantage of local
consultants and submitting work which makes Thailand dependent on
them. Such a view should be taken seriously by Thai policy-makers,
the World Bank, and especially the Finance Ministry which is
dishing out the money.
	   Indeed, many local firms could do the main consultancy work
better because of their greater understanding of local culture and
ways of working. Of course, they would need additional input from
foreign partners. However, at present the main consultancy
contracts are often won by the foreign consulting firms who then
sub-contract minor parts to local firms.
	   There are instances where expensive privatisation studies done
by foreign consultancies are gathering dust on the shelves. While
this could partly be due to internal resistance to change, some
recommendations provided by the foreign consultants are not
practical under the working culture of the Thai bureaucracy. In
many cases these recommendations cannot be immediately implemented
because more studies are required, and thus they create a
dependency.
	   The World Bank et al and the Thai government should rethink the
way consultancy work is handed out. They should also carefully
examine how the work between foreign and local consultants is
divided before awarding contracts. If they do that, they will find
they might save a lot of money and get more things done.
	   And they will also find that local consultants can do much of
the work now given to foreign consultants. Where foreign input is
needed most is not in advice but in management. How about awarding
advisory contracts to Thai consultants and hiring foreigners to
help with the actual implementation, training and managing and
supervising of governance, transparency and accountability? Then it
would be a win-win situation for everyone.

Ex-Fiat head takes over Italian Publisher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Cesare Romiti, the outgoing chairman of
industrial giant Fiat, on Tuesday was named chairman of the company
controlling Italy's largest newspaper, Corriere della Sera.
	   Italian newspapers over the weekend reported that Romiti was
likely to be appointed to head RCS Editori, the publishing arm of
Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali SpA.
	   Romiti's son, Maurizio Romiti, is the chief executive officer of
Holding.
	   Traders have said Romiti's appointment could herald a
restructuring within the group and a focus on either its fashion or
publishing businesses.
	   Romiti will replace Alberto Ronchey.
	   Fiat has a controlling interest in the publishing company, and
also owns the Turin daily La Stampa.
	   Romiti turns 75 in June, when he has said he will leave Fiat.

	   HussainPakistan has done it again. If India stunned the world by
detonating five nuclear devices in two days, Pakistan sprang a
surprise by storming into the nuclear club by conducting five tests
in one day and following it up with another blast on Saturday.
Hawks in both countries seem to have carried the day in flagrant
disregard of international opinion.India's decision to flex its
nuclear muscle and Pakistan's tit-for-tat response have dumbfounded
the world.
	   There is no gainsaying the fact that it was India that started
the deadly nuclear race in the sub-continent. The BJP leadership
with its penchant for populist measures and Maciavellian tactics
was looking for a device that could save its floundering coalition
government. And what better way could there be than the atomic
device and claim credit for making India a nuclear power state? But
the credit for making India attain nuclear power status should go
to the Nehru dynasty. It was India's first Prime Minister Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru who established the Atomic Energy Commission in
the 50s with the avowed purpose of using nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes.
	   Indira Gandhi carried forward this work a step further and
enabled India to join the nuclear club with a bang in 1974. It
should be said to India's credit that it imposed a moratorium on
further tests. It is a matter of great regret that the BJP-led
government has disregarded this self-imposed moratorium and
embarked upon a policy which could bring bigger nuclear holocaust
in the sub-continent. If the claim made by Pakistan's Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan that India is planning to conduct more
tests this month in Orissa (the earlier tests were conducted in
Rajasthan) is correct, then the portents are ominous.
	   The only silverlining in the cloud is that in India itself the
initial euphoria over the successful nuclear tests has evaporated
and the Vajpayee government is in the dock for starting this mad,
mad race.If the economic sanctions slapped on India and Pakistan by
the industrialised countries are strictly enforced, then the masses
in both the countries are bound to suffer immensely. After the
liberalisation of the economy during Narasimha Rao's Prime
Ministership, the Indian economy had made rapid strides. It has now
received a big jolt with share prices plummeting and the rupee
tumbling to an all-time low of 41-70 against the American dollar.
	   The sanctions are likely to hit Pakistan harder as its economy
is heavily dependant on foreign aid. Pakistan may be looking to the
oil-rich Gulf States to bail it out of impending economic disaster.
Will they come to Pakistan's aid in this hour of crisis? This is a
moot question.The world has justifiably reacted with shock and
anger to the uncalled-for nuclear explosions by New Delhi and
Islamabad. The hope that the latter would desist from conducting
further tests after matching India's five underground tests has
been shattered. It is high time that the two countries listened to
the voice of sanity and called a halt to the deadly arms race.
	   The unspeakable hours of Nagasaki and Hiroshima are still green
in our memory. If they ignore the call of the international
community to exercise restraint and desist from making Islamic
bomb' and Hindu bomb,' it will be tantamount to committing
hara-kiri, for in a nuclear war there won't be any victor. There
will be only losers and destruction and devastation that will
remind us of Dooms Day. Will there be light at the end of the
tunnel?

<TEXT>
	   A very good friend of mine called the other day to announce that
he was setting up a new political party. He said he was financially
well-endowed. He wanted to serve the country. The only trouble was
he didn't have a platform that could make him a serious contender.
The other problem, equally if not more serious for him, was that he
had yet to think of a name for the party.
	   I congratulated him on his show of patriotism. The country is in
trouble. We need new political leaders with convictions. A new
party will offer an alternative and much-needed vision. He will
show the electorate around the country that the existing major
parties simply don't have workable solutions to the country's
economic crisis.
	   I was excited. Finally, here's someone providing the country
with some fresh, bold and innovative platform. But an ambitious
political aspirant could be very humble indeed. He confessed that
it wasn't out of any serious convictions that he had decided to
form a political party.He is more pragmatic than that.
	   ''No, I prefer not to talk about platform. You see, I want to
set up a party for people who think the Democrats are too liberal
and the New Aspiration Party too conservative,'' he declared.
	   ''In other words, those rejected by the two major parties,'' I
suggested, not quite sure what he was getting at.
	   ''No, we will be somewhere in the middle. People want a third
choice. I am the third choice. I have money. I have connections. I
have social status,'' he declared. I was almost convinced, but my
reporter's instinct dictated that I had to pose some naive
questions.
	   ''So you are the grey party, somewhere between black and
white?'' I proposed.
	   ''No, we are white, the new white. The Democrats have turned
grey and the New Aspiration people remain black. The Thai people,
you must realise, are short on patience. They are easily bored with
politicians, however good they may be. They will jump at anything
that looks new and exciting. That's why, applying my business
marketing strategy, I will be announcing a relaunch of the same
product, only this time it will be much more attractive with a new
packaging technique.'' I was overwhelmed by that eloquent
explanation. The crucial question, though, still had to be asked.
	   ''But that doesn't hide the fact that you still don't have a
platform. People don't know what you represent,'' I said, sincerely
concerned about his devil-may-care approach.
	   He remained nonchalant. ''Don't be stupid. Politicians in this
country do not win elections through platform. Who cares? If I must
say something about platform, it's very simple. All I have to say
is that this government doesn't care about the poor and the current
opposition is too poor to do anything about the poor. They all know
I am super rich. So they will believe me when I say I am the new
champion of the poor.'' I was almost convinced. ''That may be true,
but don't you have to tell the public just how you will go about
fulfilling your promise?'' I asked, almost apologetically.
	   ''That's irrelevant. They kicked out Chavalit because they got
fed up with his underlings. Now they are beginning to get
frustrated with Chuan. It's six months, and the honeymoon is over.
They want a new face who can make new promises. And that's where I
fit in. Running this country has nothing to do with platform. It
has to do with pleasing a few outspoken academics, cajoling some
newspaper columnists and, most important of all, stroking the ego
of a handful members of the elite. The secret is: never ever stop
talking the poor whether you have done anything for them or not.''
So, in a curious way perhaps, he does have a platform. Wrapped
under a new, stunningly colourful packaging, ready for the big
relaunch.

University closed after anti-Mugabe demonstrations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Officials closed the University of
Zimbabwe Tuesday because of anti-government demonstrations and
heavily armed riot police evicted students from residence halls.
	   Protesting students lit a giant bonfire as police moved from one
hall to another on the tense campus to evict students.
	   Fleets of taxis ferried the students away from police barricades
set up at every campus entrance.
	   Students' actions had ``made it impossible to continue operating
normally,'' the university's principal and Vice Chancellor Graham
Hill told state radio. ``The closure has been necessitated by the
criminal damage to University of Zimbabwe by a group of students.''
	   Hill's boss is Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who is the
university chancellor and controls the university senate under a
1994 law.
	   The university campus houses about 3,000 students and another
2,000 students live elsewhere around the city.
	   Mugabe was the target of thousands of student demonstrators last
week who blocked the streets leading to Parliament and demanded
Mugabe's resignation. Chants and signs compared allegations of
government corruption under Mugabe with that of Indonesia's deposed
President Suharto.
	   At one point, police fired tear gas and used riot sticks to
disperse demonstrators. On Monday, a group of 30 students left a
demonstration to smash downtown shop windows.
	   This was the third closing of Zimbabwe's oldest and largest
university due to political unrest since Mugabe came to power in
1980, when the former Rhodesia became independent.
	   Hill did not specify the criminal damage to the campus. Last
year dissident students were accused of vandalizing kitchen
equipment including refrigerators.
	   Student grievances in Harare and on Zimbabwe's three newer
campuses have been inflamed by a 60 percent drop in the value of
the Zimbabwe dollar over the past year, with parents being asked to
dig deeper into their pockets.

Former provincial leader of Haider's party is arrested 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A senior member of Joerg Haider's
right-wing Freedom Party was arrested Tuesday on his return from a
vacation to Mauritius and questioned about possible financial
wrongdoing.
	   Police said Bernhard Gratzer, the former head of Haider's party
in Austria's largest province of Lower Austria, is suspected of
involvement in a financial scandal that has rocked Europe's most
successful rightist movement since early May.
	   Any revelations by Gratzer, who has an intimate knowledge of
developments in the biggest opposition party, could seriously hurt
Haider, whose party has dipped in public opinion polls as a result
of the affair.
	   At the center of the scandal is Peter Rosenstingl, a
parliamentary deputy and financial officer of the party, who is
suspected of embezzling tens of millions of dollars.
	   Rosenstingl fled the country with his girlfriend, taking along a
large sum of money, and is believed to be hiding somewhere in
Brazil.
	   Earlier this month, party leaders approved tough disclosure
rules demanded by Haider after the populist leader forced Gratzer
and two other lawmakers to resign in an attempt to limit damage to
the party.
	   The scandal has dealt a blow to the image of Haider, a stern
critic of bureaucracy and alleged corruption in other parties, who
has aspirations to be Austria's next chancellor.
	   He has thrived on fostering anti-foreigner sentiment and
attracting voters fed up with scandals, the large paychecks of a
cozy political elite and growing unemployment.
	   While still vacationing in Mauritius, Gratzer revoked an earlier
decision to give up in the next few days his seat in the Lower
Austrian provincial diet.
	   However, with his lawmaker's immunity lifted already, Gratzer is
open to prosecution and will stand trial if there is an indictment.

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Using two helicopters from
neighboring Tajikistan, the International Red Cross evacuated
wounded Tuesday from remote villages in northern Afghanistan
flattened by an earthquake that killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   The death toll has been climbing steadily since the 6.9
magnitude quake struck Saturday, triggering landslides that
swallowing entire villages. Thousands of people remained missing as
aid workers struggled to reach the most remote areas cut off by
landslides.
	   The devastation hit a region that is home to more than 70,000
people, most of whom have been left homeless. International aid
workers relied on helicopters to ferry supplies.
	   ``For the time being, we have two helicopters in there,'' said
Juan Fuertes Guillen, a Red Cross spokesman in neighboring
Pakistan. ``We have already started to establish priorities,
carrying out medical evacuations and treating the wounded at the
sites.''
	   The Red Cross and the United Nations ferried in tons of supplies
Tuesday _ most of it to provide emergency shelter. As many as
60,000 people were in need of shelter, said Guillen.
	   The quake sent houses tumbling down mountainsides. Up to 80
villages were estimated to be heavily damaged, and another dozen
obliterated.
	   The Red Cross and the United Nations set up mobile medical units
in Shari Basurkh, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Faisabad, the
capital of northern Badakhshan province.
	   Doctors Without Borders operated a clinic there. Helicopters
ferried the wounded, many of them with broken bones. Most were
small children or the elderly.
	   Germany will give 500,000 marks (dlrs 278,000) to support relief
efforts by the Red Cross and other relief organizations, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel announced Tuesday.
	   France was sending about 35 tons of aid to nearby Dushanbe,
Tajikistan, to be transported to the disaster area. Japan, the
European Union, and the Netherlands were also sending assistance.
	   Among the hardest-hit areas was Rostaq, the site of a Feb. 4
earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left another
8,000 homeless. Some reports said another 1,000 people in Rostaq
died in Saturday's quake.
	   There have been unconfirmed reports of heavy fighting between
the Taliban religious army and the opposition alliance west of the
quake-ruined region. The reports could not be confirmed, but
opposition officials said they took territory from the Taliban in
the far western Badghis province.
	   The Taliban also offered to send aid to earthquake victims
through the Red Crescent, although there was no immediate
independent confirmation.

India to nuclear powers: Quit preaching, get rid of atomic arms

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Bucking international criticism, Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee suggested Tuesday that the five
traditional declared nuclear powers get rid of their own arsenals
rather than preach to India.
	   ``Let us see if they heed our call,'' Vajpayee told 300
supporters who came to his house in New Delhi to congratulate him
for India's five underground nuclear tests last month.
	   Those underground tests prompted neighboring Pakistan to
retaliate with six announced nuclear tests of its own, igniting a
nuclear arms race on the volatile subcontinent.
	   In Geneva, 46 countries jointly demanded in a statement Tuesday
that India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and
join the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconciliable with the claims by both countries that they
are committed to nuclear disarmament,'' said the statement.
	   Among the countries that backed the statement before an
emergency meeting of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament were
the traditional declared nuclear powers of United States, Britain,
China, France and Russia. Also supporting the ban on further
testing were Japan, South Korea, South Africa and European and
Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing were Middle
Eastern countries.
	   The statement said India's and Pakistan's explosions in May were
``provocative and dangerous acts.''
	   In his speech Tuesday, Vajpayee noted that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had said there is need to rethink
disarmament issues.
	   ``I want to add that the time has come not just to think but to
act as well,'' Vajpayee said to applause. ``There have been endless
meetings, discussions and seminars on disarmament, but no steps
have been taken to get rid of nuclear weapons.''
	   Vajpayee reiterated that he had asked India's scientists to test
only as many devices as needed to safeguard India's security and
then ordered a moratorium on further tests.
	   Jane's Defense Weekly reported Tuesday that India pulled back at
the last minute from carrying out a sixth nuclear test.
	   The London-based weekly, quoting unidentified defense sources,
said even though two other small devices were tested May 13, the
third test was abandoned that day partly due to a minor technical
hitch but largely for political reasons. The government was
apparently hesitant after being hit with U.S. sanctions for three
tests May 11.
	   ``The unexploded device has reportedly been recovered from the
site and put into ``safekeeping'','' Jane's said.
	   Also Tuesday, Atomic Energy Commission chief R. Chidambaram
denied a local report that he told fellow scientists Monday that
more small nuclear tests might be carried out for research
purposes. He said there would be no further testing.
	   The United States, Australia, Japan and other countries have cut
off loans and all but humanitarian aid to punish India and
Pakistan.
	   Montek Singh Ahluwalia, India's top Finance Ministry official,
said Tuesday that state-owned Indian corporations can still borrow
from U.S. banks. Only direct investment to the government in the
form of treasury bills and government bonds is affected, he said.
	   India's latest budget, presented Monday, contains a 14 percent
increase in defense expenditures and a hefty 68 percent hike in
spending on atomic energy.

Aides: Yeltsin tries to tap into KGB skills by appointing ex-agents 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's appointment of former
KGB agents to key government jobs was an attempt to tap into what
the spy agency did best _ enforce discipline and gather information
_ top aides said Tuesday.
	   In the past week, Yeltsin has named three former spies to key
jobs in his administration dealing with Russia's far-flung regions,
where the Kremlin has suffered several recent setbacks.
	   ``The president's administration is pumping up muscle,'' said
Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   Regional officials have been blamed for misspending federal
funds allocated to the regions, thereby contributing to the chronic
problem of unpaid wages and pensions that touched off recent
strikes and protests.
	   The regions have also dealt the Kremlin a few political blows,
electing a convicted embezzler mayor in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's
third largest city, and Yeltsin critic Alexander Lebed governor in
Siberia.
	   Critics have said the former agents of the KGB and its successor
agencies, trained in the repressive Soviet system, oppose democracy
and market reforms.
	   While Yeltsin's aides did not respond directly to the
accusations, they agreed that the agents were given the new jobs
for their skills in tightening discipline and gathering
information.
	   The appointments reflect ``a radically new attitude to the
relations between the center and the regions,'' said Yeltsin's
deputy chief of staff, Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   ``The foundation of this policy will be the strengthening of
budgetary and financial discipline, of responsibility,''
Savostyanov told reporters. ``This is the strengthening ... of
getting thorough information about regional processes, about how
the president's decrees are being carried out, where they are being
sabotaged, when they are being stalled.''
	   Yeltsin has appointed former secret agents as his first deputy
chief of staff in charge of relations with Russia's regions; head
of the presidential department controlling how regional officials
spend money from Moscow; and head of the darkly named Department
for Special Programs.
	   Little is known about the department, although it is believed to
be involved in regional issues.
	   ``In general, this is a sign of strengthening discipline in the
government apparatus,'' Savostyanov said.

Harpooned whale turns on whaling boat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A harpooned whale rammed the Norwegian boat
that shot it, breaking the vessel's mast and dumping two crewmen
into the icy waters, an Oslo newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The whale escaped, but it was unclear if it survived its
injuries, according to Verdens Gang. One crewman was injured from
the fall.
	   The incident occurred Monday off Norway's northern tip, about
700 kilometers (425 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, where the
Bolga harpooned a minke whale, the newspaper said.
	   The whale then rammed the 53-foot (16-meter) wooden boat, and
pulled with tremendous force on the rope attached to the harpoon,
it said. The impact broke the boat's 8-meter (26-foot) mast,
throwing two crewmen spotting whales from atop the mast into the
water.
	   ``I had made it about halfway down the mast when I felt a sudden
jolt. The next thing I knew, I was in the water,'' crewman Benn
Viggo Nilsen, 40, was quoted as telling the newspaper.
	   Nilsen and Bjoern Johansen were rescued. Johansen suffered
cracked ribs, while Nilsen was uninjured.
	   The Bolga was so badly damaged that it had to withdraw from this
year's hunt, the report said.
	   The minke whale can grow up to 9 meters (30 meters) long.
	   Norway has endured frequent protests since resuming its
commercial whaling hunts in 1993, despite a ban imposed by the
International Whaling Commission in 1986.

Russia ready to sign treaty on money-laundering 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ready to sign an international treaty
designed to stop the laundering of proceeds from crime, including
arms dealing, terrorist activities, fraud and drug trafficking,
President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin instructed Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to take the
necessary steps to sign the treaty drafted by the Council of Europe
in 1990, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The treaty commits the 40 members of the council, Europe's
leading human rights organization, to cooperate in seizing money
earned from crime.
	   Russia joined the council in 1996.

EU denounces Abkhazia violence; appeals for calm 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union expressed concern
Tuesday over recent violence in Georgia's breakaway region of
Abkhazia, where at least 100 people died in clashes this month.
	   The 15-nation bloc urged both sides to respect a ceasefire that
took effect last Tuesday. ``The conflict in Abkhazia can only be
resolved by peaceful negotiations, by respecting Georgia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' said a statement of the EU
presidency, now held by Britain.
	   Last week, over 30,000 Georgians fled Abkhazia after fighting
broke out in the Ghali region, most of them ethnic Georgians who
had returned home recently after fleeing a 1992-93 war.
	   Ten eastern European countries and Cyprus, all EU candidate
members, backed the EU statement.
	   Abkhazia is a Black Sea province that declared independence in
1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and ethnic Georgians in
a 13-month war.
	   There has been sporadic violence since then. A ceasefire, signed
by Georgian, Abkhazian, Russian and UN officials, that took effect
last Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   IF statistics unveiled recently by the Malaysian Motor Traders
Association (MMTA) painted an unflattering picture of the
automotive industry, it was also not entirely unexpected. Rumblings
of a market shakedown were already felt months before the end of
last year. Yet robust performance for the earlier part of 1997
enabled the industry to record a modest growth of 11% for the year.
	   For the last six months, however, the combined effect of the
1998 Budget, weakening of the ringgit, the depressed stockmarket
and the credit squeeze has begun to exact a heavy toll on the
market. Sales of new cars have reportedly fallen by more than 60%.
Used car value has declined by more than 30%.
	   MMTA expects a sharp market decline for all sub-sectors. Total
industry volume is predicted to fall by about 60%. While sales of
4X4 and commercial vehicles may be the worst hit, the market for
passenger cars is foreseen to decline just as badly. From more than
300,000 units sold last year, total sales for 1998 is expected to
be in the region of 130,000 cars.
	   With its control of some 80% of the domestic passenger car
sub-sector, manufacturer of the national car, DRB-Hicom, could be
in for an especially rough ride ahead. Proton, the main operating
subsidiary of the group, is already on a major cost-cutting drive
with substantial production cuts on the cards. The group's Perodua
plant in Rawang is reported to have scaled down production to 2,800
units this year from 10,000 units the year before. The situation is
apparently just as pressing, is not worse, at facilities of
non-national car assemblies.
	   Depressing sales at Cycle  Carriage Bintang, assembler and
distributor of Mercedes Benz and Mazda cars, has led to temporary
closure of its production facility for three months since April 1.
Workers have been asked to go on long leave with a 25% pay cut.
	   The question is what will happen after that. Few expect the
industry to turn around in such a short time. What will happen to
the 50,000 workers employed by the sector? How long can car
companies stay in the black? What options do they have?
	   Quite naturally, because of its commanding position in the
market, all eyes will be on the DRB-Hicom Group. Its offer of
substantially cheaper lower range models - Kancil and Iswara - has
created some excitement in the market. So is its foray into
overseas markets. However, whatever benefits these may bring, they
are unlikely to be able to return sales to anywhere near last
year's level anytime soon. What remains is for the group, indeed
the entire industry, to dig in and persevere. They should be
prepared for a tough long haul. It would be unrealistic to expect a
shortcut out of the present situation. - Editor

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Using two helicopters from
neighboring Tajikistan, the International Red Cross evacuated
wounded Tuesday from remote villages in northern Afghanistan
flattened by an earthquake that killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   The death toll has been climbing steadily since the 6.9
magnitude quake struck Saturday, triggering landslides that
swallowing entire villages. Thousands of people remained missing as
aid workers struggled to reach the most remote areas cut off by
landslides.
	   The devastation hit a region that is home to more than 70,000
people, most of whom have been left homeless. International aid
workers relied on helicopters to ferry supplies because much of the
worst-hit areas were impossible to reach by road.
	   In neighboring Pakistan, the United Nations put out an appeal
for more helicopters and fuel.
	   ``We call upon everyone and anyone who can provide us with
helicopters to do so now,'' said Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, U.N.
coordinator for aid to Afghanistan. ``We would be particularly
grateful if neighboring countries could come forward and help.''
	   Red Cross helicopters have delivered 2 tons of high protein
biscuits, flour and oil to victims in Shari Basurkh, near the
quake's epicenter, some 45 kilometers (27 miles) from Faisabad, the
provincial capital of Badakhshan.
	   ``For the time being, we have two helicopters in there,'' said
Juan Fuertes Guillen, a Red Cross spokesman in neighboring
Pakistan. ``We have already started to establish priorities,
carrying out medical evacuations and treating the wounded at the
sites.''
	   The Red Cross and the United Nations brought tons of supplies
Tuesday _ most of it to provide emergency shelter. As many as
60,000 people were in need of shelter, said Guillen.
	   The quake sent houses tumbling down mountainsides. Up to 80
villages were estimated to be heavily damaged, and another dozen
obliterated.
	   The Red Cross and the United Nations set up mobile medical units
in Shari Basurkh, where Doctors Without Borders operated a clinic.
Helicopters brought in the wounded, many of them with broken bones.
Most were small children or the elderly.
	   Germany will give 500,000 marks (dlrs 278,000) to support relief
efforts by the Red Cross and other relief organizations, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel announced Tuesday.
	   France was sending about 35 tons of aid to nearby Dushanbe,
Tajikistan, to be transported to the disaster area. Japan, the
European Union, and the Netherlands were also sending assistance.
	   Among the hardest-hit areas was Rostaq, the site of a Feb. 4
earthquake that killed as many as 2,300 people and left another
8,000 homeless. Some reports said another 1,000 people in Rostaq
died in Saturday's quake.
	   There have been unconfirmed reports of heavy fighting between
the Taliban religious army and the opposition alliance west of the
quake-ruined region. The reports could not be confirmed, but
opposition officials said they took territory from the Taliban in
the far western Badghis province.
	   The Taliban also offered to send aid to earthquake victims
through the Red Crescent, although there was no immediate
independent confirmation.

Miners' protests continue in Ukraine despite government appeal 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Despite an appeal by the Ukrainian
government, dozens of miners rallied Tuesday in front of parliament
headquarters, demanding the payment of back wages.
	   The workers were backed by left-wing opposition activists, who
long have sought to capitalize on their protests so as to achieve
political goals.
	   Dozens of Ukrainian mines have been idled by scattered strikes
since last month, with workers demanding the payment of wage
arrears, salary hikes and more state support for the struggling
coal industry.
	   Last week, the government and two miners' unions, including the
largest, the Coal Industry Workers' Union, signed a protocol in
which the authorities pledged to meet some of the workers' demands.
In particular, the government promised to spend a total of 800
million hryvna (dlrs 400 million) to support the industry.
	   But the Independent Miners' Union refused to accept the
document, pointing out that the government only promised to
allocate 500 million hryvna (dlrs 250 million) to cover wage
arrears.
	   The union estimates the total sum owed to the miners at 2.2
billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion), the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   In a statement late Monday, the government said it could only
fulfill the independent union's demands at the expense of other
miners. It called on the striking miners to show ``wisdom'' in a
joint search for a solution and also blamed some coal industry
leaders for failing to ensure prompt wage payments to the miners,
Interfax said.
	   ``The current crisis in the coal industry has deep and
structural roots. It is practically impossible to quickly resolve
the miners' problems, which have piled up for years,'' the
statement said.
	   Speaking at a government meeting, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko also blamed the wage crisis on coal industry
managers' irresponsibility, and insisted that the government was
fulfilling its financial commitment to the industry, Interfax said.
	   Besides financial problems, Ukraine's coal industry is plagued
by poor work discipline that, together with outdated equipment, has
claimed the lives of about 170 miners this year.
	   On Tuesday, rescue workers found the body of a miner who died in
a May 28 rock collapse at a mine in eastern Ukraine, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   In an accident Monday, the main ventilation system stopped
working at the Matrosskaya mine in the eastern Luhansk region, the
ministry said. Some 53 workers who were inside the mine at the time
were safely lifted to the surface, it said.

<TEXT>
	   THAILAND could become a major international supplier of
amphetamine as Thai drug cartels have struck up an alliance with
their Lao and Burmese counterparts to produce the illicit stimulant
in neighbouring countries, according to a drug expert.
	   Dr Vichai Poshyachinda, a drug expert and member of the
Narcotics Control Board, said the shift in production base was
aimed mainly to circumvent tougher control on chemical precursors,
such as ephedrine, which is classified as a restrictively
controlled substance in Thailand.
	   ''It becomes as clear as jigsaw pieces falling into place that
Thai drug cartels are on their way to becoming major suppliers of
amphetamine in the international market,'' said Vichai.
	   The supply of amphetamine in Thailand was believed to be from
foreign sources outside the Southeast Asian region until the first
clandestine laboratory was found in a Bangkok suburb in 1986.
Supplies of amphetamine have increased dramatically along with
demand for the stimulant in recent years.
	   He cited Laos' recent anti-drug report which indicated that most
of the cases of production of amphetamine in Laos involved
importing substances for the purpose of immediate re-export either
to circumvent import tax in the target countries or to divert the
substances for illicit purposes.
	   In one of the major drug busts in recent years, Lao
drug-enforcement officials in a northwestern province raided a
clandestine amphetamine laboratory, arresting 25 suspects,
including seven Thais and 10 Burmese, and seized more than 20
tonnes of material and equipment, the report said.
	   Among the substances seized in the raid were various chemical
precursors imported from a neighbouring country. Lao
law-enforcement officials also seized 6.7 tonnes of chemical
precursors near the Mekong River not far from the laboratory.
	   The report was submitted to an international seminar on
drug-abuse problems in Bangkok recently.
	   Another report made by the Burmese government said that although
stimulant and hallucinogen abuse were not popular in Burma,
law-enforcement officials had reported an increasing number of
people arrested in connection with production and trafficking of
amphetamine.
	   In 1996 law-enforcement officials made arrests in 13 cases of
amphetamine production and trafficking, seizing 5.9 million
tablets. Last year there were nine offences, with a seizure of more
than 1.1 million tablets.
	   It was also known that ephedrine was being moved from China to
Thailand through Burma's Shan State.
	   Vichai said the Golden Triangle, the major production area of
opiates that straddles the Thai, Burmese and Lao borders, has now
expanded its output to include large supplies of methamphetamine.
	   ''The involvement of a multinational network extending over the
whole Far East in the illicit trade is also evident,'' Vichai said.
	   Although the manufacture of illicit stimulants in the Asean
countries is evidently confined to methamphetamine, abuse of
illicit stimulants includes the Ecstasy group of amphetamine
derivatives and cocaine, he said.
	   ''It is clear that the abuse of stimulants is fostered
simultaneously by intra- and extra-regional supplies,'' Vichai
said.

EU criticizes U.S. quota on wheat gluten imports from Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Tuesday
denounced the U.S. decision to limit imports of EU wheat gluten
over a three-year period and warned of retaliation.
	   The quota, ``represents a major restriction on European
exports,'' the EU executive Commission said in a statement.
	   ``This action is all the more surprising coming from a
government that only two weeks ago was calling on WTO members to
further liberalize trade in agricultural products.''
	   The EU head office was considering ``appropriate responses'' but
gave no immediate details.
	   EU spokesman Gerard Kiely said the quota suggested Washington
will defend free farm trade if that serves American farmers only.
	   The EU has nabbed 30 percent of the American wheat gluten
market. Kiely said that was because wheat prices in Europe are
lower than corn prices, whereas the reverse is true in the United
States.
	   EU officials said high imports of EU wheat gluten into the
United States had been predicted for years and said they were
``astonished this evidence was ignored'' for so long. They termed
the U.S. quota unfair, especially since other exporters, such as
Canada, have been exempted from it.
	   On Monday, President Clinton signed off on a three-year quota on
imported wheat gluten. He followed a recommended to that effect,
issued in March, by the U.S. International Trade Commission.
	   The quota will be 126 million pounds (57,000 metric tons) in the
first year, rising by 6 percent annually.
	   Each year the U.S. industry consumes 22 million bushels of
wheat, worth about dlrs 100 million. Two billion tons of wheat
flour yield 300 million pounds of gluten annually.
	   Wheat gluten is the natural protein portion of the grain. It
adds protein to breakfast cereals, pet food, livestock feed and
helps whole-grain breads rise.
	   The wheat gluten debate is yet another transatlantic trade
dispute.
	   Only last week, the two sides wrangled over a 30,000-ton
shipment of subsidized Finnish barley that landed on U.S. soil. The
United States announced it would start subsidizing barley exports.
	   This year, the United States introduced poultry export subsidies
after the EU imposed restrictions on US poultry imports.

	   BEARS are likely to continue to dominate trading on the Kuala
Lumpur stockmarket as interest rates and inflation remain firm,
non-performing loans rise and more stockbroking firms face
financial difficulties.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said recently
that Malaysia's interest rates were comfortable, although the
International Monetary Fund has suggested that they be increased.
He added that he would keep his options open as far as the overall
interest of the country is concerned, especially in ensuring stable
macro-economic conditions.
	   Malaysia's Consumer Price Index rose 5.1% in March this year, as
compared to a year ago. For the January to March period, the CPI
rose by 4.3%, compared to the same period in 1997. The Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research has forecast that inflation this
year will rise to 10.5% before falling to 3.1% next year.
	   To date, 13 securities firms have been placed under trading
restrictions by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Omega Securities
has also been ordered by the Securities Commission to stop trading
until it is able to fulfil the Exchange's minimum liquid fund
requirement.
	   Unrelenting selling has caused the market barometer, the KLSE
Composite Index, to dive 83.55 points during the 20 trading days of
April. The index fell a further 41.35 points in early May to close
at 584.62 on May 6. The index's lowest level since the beginning of
the year was 477.57 points, recorded on Jan 12.
	   The market remains jittery despite comments by political leaders
and some economists that the worst is over. Anwar told US fund
managers last month that Malaysia's economy is recovering.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Gordon
Brown said recently that Asia is showing signs of recovery, and
confidence is returning to the region. He also said Malaysia has
done well to avoid the worst of the economic problems.
	   US Conference Board chief economist Gail Fosler told a seminar
in Kuala Lumpur recently that the Malaysian economy could start
recovering by year- end or early 1999, with issues of consumer
spending and inflation dominating the economy in the fourth quarter
of this year.
	   The Asian Development Bank (ABD) expects Malaysia's Gross
Domestic Product to grow by between 3% and 4% this year, the lowest
increase in more than a decade. ABD also said in its recently
released annual report that domestic demand will fall sharply due
to the depreciation of the Ringgit, a collapse in asset values, and
tighter fiscal and monetary policies.
	   The most active stock for April was Sime Darby Bhd, which is
selling its majority stake in its banking arm, Sime Bank, to Rashid
Hussain Bhd. With 82.858 million shares changing hands, the stock
fell by 78 sen to RM3.30.
	   It fell 72 sen in March.
	   Tenaga Nasional Bhd's share price continued to be under pressure
from institutional selling. It fell RM1.75 to RM7.45, with a total
of 76.393 million shares traded. The shares of another utility
giant, Telekom Malaysia, were also heavily sold with the price down
RM1.40 last month.
	   The third most active stock was ailing Omega Holdings, with its
share price down 80 sen to close April at 50 sen. Another
stockbroking-related company, Uniphoenix Corporation Bhd, which has
a controlling stake in debt-ridden Halim Securities, fell RM1.08 in
April in active trading of 45.563 million shares.
	   Bank and finance stocks were also bearish as share investors
were worried over their non-perfoming loans exposure. Malayan
Banking share price plunged RM3 to RM11, Commerce Asset was down 38
sen, MBf Capital dropped 42 sen and Public Bank eased 22 sen.

	   THE Prachakorn Thai Party, Monday, moved a step closer to
expelling its 12 rebel MPs by firing all the executives on the
party's board.
	   However, the rebel MPs, who were among the 17 executives fired,
argued that the resolution violated regulations and threatened to
appeal to the Constitution Court.
	   Earlier, four executives on the rebels' side had resigned from
the board thereby quitting the party.
	   Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej had the board appoint 21
new executives immediately, which would give him monopoly over the
board, as a final step in expelling the 12 rebels.
	   Samak has yet to schedule the next meeting of the board which
will concentrate on expelling the 12 members. To get rid of them,
Samak would need votes from at least 49 of 65 party executives
before he expels the renegade MPs.
	   The appointment of the new executives had been approved in a
party assembly, which followed the board's meeting.
	   Somboon Vessunthorn, a party executive close to Samak, said the
party has yet to submit Monday's resolution, to appoint new
executives, to the political parties' registrar for acknowledgment
before the new board can convene.
	   Somboon said he expected the 12 MPs to be expelled within two
months.
	   Most of the rebel MPs attended Monday's board meeting, except
Deputy Interior Minister Vatana Assavahame and PM's Office Minister
Somboon Rahong.
	   After being fired from the board, Deputy Government spokesman
Pan Phuengsujarit said the resolution had violated Article 45 of
the party's regulations.
	   Pan said that even though Samak had set up a committee to
investigate the 12 MPs, the panel had never asked them to testify
or allowed them to defend themselves against allegations.
	   ''We will appeal to the Civil and Constitution courts for a
ruling on whether the resolution to expel us from the board was
justified or not,'' Pan said.
	   However, Samak argued that Article 45 could only be applied when
a party member is expelled from the party, not from the board.
	   Earlier, Samak had replaced 11 executives loyal to the rebel MPs
with his own men. The rebels had appealed with the Election
Commission that resolution violated the party's regulations but the
commission had ruled in Samak's favour. The MPs then sought a
ruling, yet to be made, from the Constitution Court.

	   THE Rolls-Royce of all cars is here in Malaysia. It is, not
surprisingly, a Rolls-Royce! The Silver Seraph, to be exact.
Indeed, the Silver Seraph is the first new Rolls-Royce for nearly
two decades - an eternity in modern motoring terms for a new model
to be introduced. But then, the Rolls-Royce is not your everyday
anonymous utility runabout rolling off some highly mechanised mass
production line. Such is the premium attached to individual
craftsmanship and attention to detail as Rolls-Royce owners come
from the monied ranks drawn from royalty, business tycoons, more
royalty and more business tycoons. In fact, at least one member of
royalty and one tycoon (apparently unaffected by economic problems
like most others) was spotted at a reception held by Next Car Sdn
Bhd - the distributor of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars in Malaysia -
a few Saturdays ago to introduce the Silver Seraph to the Malaysian
public. Need one add that they had come chauffeur-driven - in their
Rolls-Royces of course! So, if you are one of eight people
(Malaysia's quota for this year's production) in the land with
RM3.4 million in loose change (after the pernicious 300% import
duty and a further 10% sales tax), hurry along and grab one. Even
before BMW began wooing Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to form an auto
alliance, the German automaker already had a foot in the door. The
Silver Seraph's all-aluminium 5.4 litre, V12 engine beats with a
Teutonic heart. In fact it was back in 1994 that both companies
started engineering collaboration to develop and test the specific
power and torque characteristics required for the new Rolls-Royce
Silver Seraph. The result is a linear torque characteristic
providing smooth delivery of power from low engine revs, allowing
the car to accelerate through to 100 kmph in under seven seconds.
	   But all that is secondary to the Rolls-Royce inimitable regal
looks.
	   Seraph points to a celestial being of the highest order
associated especially with light, ardour and purity. The new name,
Silver Seraph is spelt out in the graceful exterior styling which
is a contemporary treatment of classic Rolls-Royce themes. Its
defining feature is the shouldered waistline which sweeps unbroken
from nose to tail with both the cabin and boot inset from it.
Viewed from the side, the waistline reaches a plateau just forward
of the front door handles, then gradually falls along the length of
the car in one continuous line. Allowing the boot to rise
independently of this falling waistline not only links the Seraph
to previous Rolls-Royce styles but offers improved aerodynamic
efficiency and a significant increase in luggage space.
	   The re-proportioned radiator grille has been integrated into the
overall front end design via a featured step in the front bumper
and a softened, sloping header tank. The Silver Seraph's headlamps
are separate from and adjacent to the radiator shell, retaining
design links with the marque's lineage but incorporating complex
refractor lighting. Front wing crowns are raised to be visible to
the driver, aiding placement and manoeuvrability. The corner lamps
are designed to reinforce the visual strength of the wings without
interrupting the continuous flowing surfaces. Chrome details are
employed to help the eye pass around the car in one continuous
appraisal. The overall effect is a vehicle that looks compact and
tailored whilst having great presence and sweeping lines.
	   Step inside the Seraph and be transported into a world of
sculptured waistrails, crowned fascia and console and softened,
rounded seat silhouettes. The highly appointed, hand-crafted
interior combines Connolly hide and Wilton carpets, smooth chrome
switches, detailed stitching and the finest veneered woodwork.
Advanced technology has been employed in creating a new seat
design. Apart from improving front seat headroom and legroom,
variable density seat foam provides anatomically correct levels of
support to the shoulders, back, base of spine and thighs.
	   The Silver Seraph may have taken a long time in coming. But the
wait has not been in vain for the rich and richer-still who will no
doubt credit Rolls-Royce for coming up with the Rolls-Royce of
Rolls-Royces - that is until Rolls-Royce produces another
Rolls-Royce! In another 20 years' time, perhaps?

Turkish Parliament denounces French Armenian genocide bill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Parliament on Tuesday condemned a French
legislative motion recognizing the 1915 killings of ethnic
Armenians in Turkey as a genocide.
	   ``It is extremely sad that such an unjust step that deliberately
distorts historical facts and targets the Turkish nation has been
taken,'' said a decree.
	   Last week, France's National Assembly unanimously adopted a
one-sentence motion stating: ``France publicly recognizes the
Armenian genocide of 1915.''
	   The motion must go before the French Senate for approval.
	   The decree said that if upheld by the Senate, the decision would
harm Turkish-French relations.
	   Turkey denies that the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians
between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide, insisting that losses
occurred on both sides as the result of a civil war.
	   Turkey has protested the measure and threatened economic
retaliation.

	   LEADERS of the New Aspiration Party are expected to retain their
posts at an NAP caucus Tuesday but limited changes to the party
leadership could force young blood members to defect, sources said.
	   Even deputy NAP deputy leader Wan Mohammad Noor Matha admitted
Monday he expected 20 per cent of NAP MPs to defect before the next
election.
	   Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh will remain the NAP leader and Snoh
Thienthong the party's secretary-general, according to the sources.
Chalerm Yoobamrung, who has dissolved his Muanchon Party to join
the NAP, would be made one of the deputy party leaders.
	   Under an adjusted structure, the party is giving more power to
its regional headquarters. A position of regional chairpersons has
been created as part of the decentralisation.
	   However, only the northeastern faction is happy with the change,
since the Northeast has been the NAP's power base. Young blood
members of the party believe that the adjustment would not help in
expanding NAP's popularity to other regions, especially in cities
where the Democrats have been holding sway.
	   ''The changes are good, but not good enough in the eyes of the
young MPs,'' said a party source who asked not to be named.
	   But what disheartens the new generation members the most has
been the media's negative attitude towards the party, which seems
unlikely to become the core of the next government, the source
said.
	   ''Because of the feeling of despair and the disappointment with
what they think is insufficient structural reform, many young MPs
are pondering leaving the party to join other camps or run in
senatorial election instead,'' said the source.
	   Wan Mohammad Noor, who is also Parliament president, confirmed
the speculation, saying he believed the NAP would lose 20 per cent
of its incumbent MPs to other parties before the next election. He
said he did not know how many of the potential defectors would join
telecom tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra's new party.

	   KLANG Container Terminal still maintained its lead in terms
market reach for Port Klang container business in the past year
despite a reduction in profit. The terminal registered a total
throughput of 993,010 TEUs in 1997 which was 4.88% higher in
comparison to the figure in the previous year.
	   The figure works out to be more than 50% of the estimated total
size of the container business through Port Klang.
	   However, international trade felt some pressure caused by the
weakening of the currencies' value and the economic turmoil in the
Southeast Asian region. This has caused a profound reduction in
import activities in Malaysia, whilst, there is still prospect of
sustainable exporting activities with the Government's economic
stabilisation plan.
	   Chairman Datuk Rahmat Jamari said during the company's recently
concluded AGM: `The country's economic slowdown and the
consequential effects of increasing competition from alternative
container terminals have had a direct impact on the company's
performance in 1997'. KCT's revenue decreased 1.5% from RM191.9
million in 1996 to RM189.1 million in 1997. Pre-tax profit also
fell by 13.7% from RM73.3 million in 1996 to RM63.3 million last
year.
	   Meanwhile KCT managing director Abdul Samad Mohamed said that
the company was reasonably successful in retaining clients in a
competitive scenario. `There has been no letting up in our efforts
to effectively position the company's services within the local and
regional markets.
	   Greater efforts have been expanded to gain the most accurate
understanding of our clients' needs, particularly in a scenario
where customers are under extreme pressure to fight for customer
support,' he added.
	   The company's plans for this year is to continue to strengthen
their partnership with clients and bid for new businesses. Measures
have been taken to maximise the utilisation of available resources
while simultaneously sustaining service quality. According to KCT,
one of the key objectives of this exercise is to try to make the
company a cost leader in the provision of service.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin shook his finger at
Russia's most powerful businessmen Tuesday and told them to do more
to keep investors from pulling out of the country's wobbling
financial markets.
	   ``Foreign investors react very quickly,'' he told 10 of Russia's
so-called ``oligarchs,'' the men who control the country's banking
conglomerates. ``If you want foreign investors to keep their money
here then you must tell your own investors not to pull out.''
	   Trying to halt the slide in Russia's financial markets, Yeltsin
summoned government and business leaders to the Kremlin on Tuesday.
	   Some of the government's responses appear to be working. After
dropping 10 percent Monday, the stock market rebounded to close
12.2 percent higher Tuesday.
	   Russia's inept tax collection system is at the heart of the
country's current financial crisis, and Yeltsin also summoned top
law enforcement officials to his office to demand better efforts.
	   ``The tax situation has not improved, only worsened, especially
in recent months,'' a gruff-sounding Yeltsin said in footage
broadcast on national television.
	   Investors' panic began last week, triggered by reverberations
from the Asian financial crisis, a wave of workers' strikes, and a
drop in world oil and gas prices. Russia is heavily dependent on
oil and gas exports.
	   The market has fallen 44 percent in the past month, and many
analysts have feared the crisis could lead to a run on the fragile
national currency, the ruble.
	   However, the financial crisis has so far affected only investors
and its effects have not yet reached ordinary Russians.
	   A top Central Bank official acknowledged Tuesday that the bank
has spent nearly dlrs 1 billion in reserves over the past month to
support the ruble.
	   Deputy Chairman Sergei Alexashenko said the bank still has dlrs
14.6 billion in reserves _ less than the market believes _ and has
not had to intervene in recent days.
	   The Russian stock market, whose performance was the world's best
last year, is this year's worst-performing exchange. After climbing
98 percent last year, the market has slid 55 percent since the
beginning of the year.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or other lenders, similar to
those arranged after Asia's financial crisis.
	   But Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Russia would
prefer to solve its own problems.
	   ``The most important thing is to rely on our own resources and
agree on joint responses by government and business and financial
circles,'' he told a news briefing.
	   In the past, Russia has had trouble meeting the stiff conditions
imposed by foreign lenders. The IMF has delayed recent installments
of a dlrs 10 billion loan to try to force Russian compliance with
the terms, which include improved tax collection and limits on
government spending.
	   Moreover, the government doesn't want to worsen the appearance
of crisis, and argues that Russia's underlying economic indicators
remain steady: The economy grew a nominal 0.8 percent last year,
and inflation is in the single digits.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France officials met with pilots' unions
Tuesday in a bid to reach a truce over a wage dispute which has
grounded planes for two days, and threatens to disrupt the World
Cup.
	   Seven members of Air France sat down with 26 union officials at
the company's headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of
Paris. The talks, the first in five days, began at 4 p.m. (1400
GMT.)
	   In an interview published Tuesday with the newspaper Le
Parisien, Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta said ``there was
still a lot of work to do'' to reach an agreement with the pilots,
and suggested postponing talks until after the World Cup.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta was quoted as saying.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike.
	   The strike caused chaos for almost 100,000 passengers Monday,
worries for fans and teams attending the June 10-July 12 World Cup
and embarrassment for all.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   At Charles de Gaulle airport, a shop employee sat alone Tuesday
in an empty store stocked with World Cup insignia. Opposite was a
newspaper stall where headlines read: ``World Cup held hostage,''
and ``World Cup in peril.''
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest against 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay
cuts. Most of the 3,200 Air France pilots did not work Monday.
	   Departure screens at airports around the nation flashed the list
of canceled flights. Air France planes, many decorated with giant
paintings of soccer players representing the 32 competing teams,
sat idle.
	   After walking 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Paris to Chartres
over the weekend with 10,000 other youths on a pilgrimage, Ellen
Kerry was trying to get to New York on an Air France flight.
	   ``We only found out when we got in the taxi that there was a
strike. We could have saved the money and walked,'' said Kerry,
whose home is in Virginia.
	   Sharon Borrege said she was trying to get to San Francisco
following a trip to Paris she took after winning Air France tickets
in a raffle at the San Francisco film festival.
	   ``I'm angry. I was told the flight was canceled and to stand in
line,'' said Borrege. ``I love France, but I now I see what they
mean about France's reputation for strikes.''
	   Air France said there would be a slight improvement in traffic
Tuesday, with 16-18 percent of long-haul flights taking off,
compared to 10 percent Monday, and 32 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights scheduled.
	   In total, 44 more flights were scheduled Tuesday, compared to
Monday.
	   Air France, the World Cup's official carrier, is committed to
transporting teams to the 10 competition sites around France. The
company has said if the strike continues it will probably use
outside carriers to meet its obligations.
	   Air France, which almost went bankrupt in 1993, has given no
indication it is ready to withdraw a controversial plan to cut
pilots' salaries in exchange for company shares. Pilots also want
Air France to do away with salary cuts for starting pilots.
	   The strike has left passengers stranded across France.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is sending the U.S. team on an American Airlines flight to Paris
that connects to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses for all their travel plans in France.
	   Former French player Michel Platini, co-president of the World
Cup organizing committee, accused the pilots Tuesday of ``taking
the country hostage.''
	   ``During a World Cup, there has to be solidarity,'' he said.
``Because this is the image of France at stake, not necessarily
that of an airline.''

	   COMMUNICATIONS Minister Suthep Thaugsuban Monday strongly
defended the international airport project at Chanthaburi, saying
the government needs to build it as an infrastructure for the
country's development.
	   The project has come under strong criticism, with critics saying
that the Bt500-million to be set aside for the project under the
1999 fiscal year should be saved for more urgent projects.
	   Suthep said all regions, except the eastern provinces, already
had international airports so Chanthaburi's international airport
would be a gateway to the eastern coast.
	   ''Although the economy is slowing down, we have to plan ahead,''
Suthep said.
	   He said the Chanthaburi airport would promote tourism in the
region as well as facilitate fruit exports.
	   Critics have said that the government should develop the
existing U-tapao navy airport in Chon Buri as an international
airport instead of building a new one.
	   But Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said Chon Buri was
too far way from other eastern provinces, especially Chanthaburi
and Trat.
	   While the two Democrat ministers strongly defended the
Chanthaburi airport project, another Democrat minister, PM's Office
Minister Jurin Laksanavisit said he favoured the idea of developing
the U-tapao airport.

	   EKRAN Bhd, confirmed that it has used part of the RM1.5 billion
cash from the issues of shares, bonds and warrants, and is
currently seeking approval from the Securities Commission (SC) to
use the proceeds for other purposes than those originally intended.
The rights issue was made for the purchase of a stake in Wembley
Industries Holding Bhd, investment in the Bakun Hydro-Electric Dam
and working capital.
	   The SC has begun its probe on Ekran relating to this matter. The
company, in an addendum to its 1997 annual report, said:
`Subsequent to the year end, part of the proceeds from the issues
have been used for purpose other than as originally approved by the
SC as these proceeds are no longer required for such approved
purpose due to the change in circumstances subsequent to the
receipt of the proceeds.' `The company is in the process of
preparing a submission to the SC to seek approval for revised
utilisation of the said proceeds.' Ekran did not disclose how much
of the proceeds was utilised and for what purpose.
	   It completed the one-for-one rights issue of 257.14 million
shares at RM5.70 per share and issue of RM300 million nominal value
of five-year two per cent bank guaranteed redeemable bonds with
64.28 million detachable warrants at 100% of the nominal value of
the bonds.
	   Meanwhile, Ekran in a circular to shareholders said it is
proposing to buy back up to 10% of its own shares or 51.42 million
shares of RM1 each and a sum of RM200 million will be allocated for
the purpose.
	   On assumption that the exercise is carried out in full, the
issued and paid up capital of the company will be reduced to 462.85
million shares.
	   It said at least half the fund for the purchase will be
generated from the group with the remainder sourced from external
borrowings.
	   The shares buy-back will enable the group to use financial
resources that do not have an immediate usage to buy back the
shares of the group.
	   The proposal will also enable Ekran group to reduce the number
of Ekran shares out in the market, which generally will have a
positive impact.
	   Ekran said the shares buy-back will reduce the financial
resources of the group and may result it foregoing good investment
opportunities that may emerge in future. It may also reduce the
ability of the group to withstand economic weakness that may arise.

U.S. media giant buys stakes in Turkish magazine chain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ The Hearst Corp. has bought a 25 percent
stake in a magazine chain run by one of Turkey's giant media
groups, a senior Hearst official said Tuesday.
	   Jorge Planas, the senior vice president for Hearst Magazines
International, said the company on Monday invested dlrs 4.1 million
in Bir Numara Publications.
	   Bir Numara is run by Medya Holding, one of Turkey's leading
media conglomerates, which also publishes the mass circulation
daily Sabah.
	   Hearst has been operating in Turkey with Bir Numara through a
joint-venture, Bir Numara-Hearst, since 1995. In addition to the
cash payment, the U.S firm traded its shares in the joint venture
to acquire the 25 percent stake in the Turkish company, thus
liquidating the joint venture.
	   ``Bir Numara has a good position in the Turkish market and there
is plenty of space for growth in the magazine market in Turkey,''
Planas said in a telephone interview.
	   Bir Numara publishes 36 separate magazines -- including the
Turkish versions of Cosmopolitan, Esquire, and Harper's Bazaar --
and its share of the magazine market is about 23.5 percent, daily
Sabah reported Tuesday.

Nuclear politics: new twist in Israel-Palestinian quarrel 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the cavernous carpeted interior of
Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, the tone of the sermon was angry.
Muslims are humiliated by the West, the mosque preacher told the
faithful _ but that could change.
	   ``The Pakistani nuclear bomb is the beginning of the resurgence
of Islamic power,'' Sheik Hayyan Idrisi told the thousands of
worshippers, who broke into a rhythmic chant of ``Allahu Akbar!'' _
God is great.
	   The scene last week at Al-Aqsa, the holiest Islamic shrine in
Jerusalem, illustrates how the nuclear rivalry of India and
Pakistan has become a troubling new factor in the already volatile
Israeli-Palestinian equation.
	   Among Palestinians, the popular response to Pakistan's nuclear
tests has been a sense of pan-Islamic pride _ and renewed
resentment over Israel's undeclared but widely assumed possession
of a large nuclear arsenal.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has refrained from either
praising or criticizing Pakistan, the first Muslim nation openly to
go nuclear.
	   But senior Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi said it
was unfair for Pakistan to face international sanctions over its
nuclear tests while Israel goes unscathed.
	   ``Israel is the one rogue country in our part of the world that
is above accountability ... when it comes to its own nuclear
weapons,'' Ashrawi, the minister of higher education, said over the
weekend. ``There is a very clear double standard.''
	   Israel has expressed concern about the accelerating arms race on
the nearby Indian subcontinent, saying nuclear proliferation
anywhere heightens the ability of states such as Iran and Iraq to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Israel has friendly political and military dealings with India _
but no relations with Muslim Pakistan. Even so, Israel has
carefully avoided publicly characterizing Pakistan's nuclear tests
as any more worrisome than those of India, which set off the
nuclear muscle-flexing.
	   ``The point is not whether or not the nuclear power is in
Islamic hands,'' said David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, pointing to Israel's ties with Muslim countries
like Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.
	   But Pakistan apparently feared the worst from Israel. Israeli
media reported Monday that Pakistan anxiously sought last-minute
assurances from the United States that Israel did not intend to
bomb its nuclear installations to prevent it from carrying out its
test detonations.
	   Bar-Illan denied the existence of any such Israeli plan, saying
there was ``no intention whatsoever'' by Israel for an air strike
against Pakistan.
	   ``I am amazed that the government of Pakistan has yet to blame
us for the earthquake in Afghanistan,'' he added acidly in an
interview with Army radio.
	   Israel, however, has not hesitated to use pre-emptive measures
in the past. In June 1981, it bombed Iraq's French-built reactor
outside Baghdad, saying Saddam Hussein was using it to produce
weapons-grade material.
	   If Arafat has withheld praise for Pakistan and its nuclear
ambitions, there are no such constraints on his rival, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas.
	   Yassin, who has been on an extended regional tour to raise money
and drum up support for Hamas, was quoted by the Sudanese newspaper
Al-Rai Al-Aam as calling Pakistan's nuclear status ``an asset to
Arab and Muslim nations.'' That made banner headlines in Israel.
	   Like Arafat, Arab governments have avoided any overt
encouragement of Pakistan. The Muslim world's main group, the
55-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, said Monday the
world must urge India and Pakistan to quickly sign a non-aggression
treaty to prevent regional instability.
	   But as in the Palestinian lands, there is widespread Arab
distaste for what is viewed as Western hypocrisy on the nuclear
issue. Countries including Saudia Arabia, Lebanon and the United
Arab Emirates have accused the United States of fueling the arms
race by ignoring Israel's nuclear arsenal.
	   Pakistan's bomb does help feed a sense of Muslim solidarity at a
time of eroding faith in the United States as a Mideast mediator.
Both Arafat and Yassin have been trying _ though with very
different agendas _ to promote the notion of Arab solutions to the
Palestinian question.
	   Israel, though, bluntly warned Palestinians against assuming
that anxieties about the changing nuclear picture will pressure it
into making territorial concessions in exchange for peace.
	   ``Whoever suggests an argument that means withdrawal from (the
West Bank) because of the `nuclear threat' _ what they are
suggesting is that we cut off our arms and legs because of a
headache,'' said Cabinet secretary Dan Naveh. ``Any peace in our
region will be one that will deter threats from both near and
far.''

	   THE securities Commission (SC) has acquired new powers to fight
insider and market manipulation following amendments to two
securities industry laws - the Securities Industry Act 1983 (SIA)
and the Securities Industry (Central Depository) Act 1991 (SICDA).
SC's chairman Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Majid said the amendments address
key regulatory principles of investor protection and market
integrity.
	   The SIA's definition of `insider' has been widened and the range
of sanctions, including civil ones, against insider trading and
market manipulation, expanded. Under the amendments any person who
possesses inside information is not only prohibited from trading in
relevant securities, but also from communicating that information.
Further, insiders are no longer just defined as persons with
fiduciary duties such as CEOs and directors. They now include all
parties who possess information not generally available, for
instance family members of a director, a body corporate who is
associated with that director, or a substantial shareholder.
	   The new sections of the SIA also allow the investing public the
chance to wield the stick on an insider trader for losses or
damages incurred.
	   Under subsection 90A(1) of the SIA, a person who traded opposite
an insider and suffered losses and damages would be able to
institute civil action. Previously only the SC could take criminal
action against insiders. A case may be brought against the offender
even if he has not been charged, or proven guilty of any charge,
under the criminal law.
	   Munir stresses that the new provisions are aimed at enhancing
transparency and corporate governance in line with the move towards
disclosure-based regulation.

	   THE Police Department Monday took drastic action against several
senior officers involved in various wrongdoings, including ruling a
guilty verdict on a former Forestry Police Division chief in
relation to the Salween logging scandal.
	   An investigation committee said it had found that Pol Maj Gen
Phithak Thienthong guilty of negligence and of violating the code
of conduct for having failed to battle forest encroachment in Mae
Hong Son's national park.
	   The panel said it would acquaint the department of its finding
about Phithak's offences and said it would further probe the
scandal. Also found guilty of the same offences was Pol Maj Gen
Chalerm Sarawanangkoon, then a deputy forestry police chief.
	   Pol Col Sithiporn Srijanthab, then chief of a forestry police
sub-division, was temporarily suspended from service and would also
be facing criminal prosecution of the same offences.
	   The committee also suspended three senior officers attached to
the Police Cadet Academy -- Pol Col Wattana Krittiyachote, Pol Lt
Anucha Khotchaseni and Pol Sub Lt Jamlong Thabsrikaew -- and two
police cadets, for conspiring to cheat in a recent examination.
	   Also suspended from service were Pol Col Surachai Watcharayothin
and Pol Lt Col Paisal Wongwassana, both police scientists from the

	   THE mergers of local banks will translate into the emergence of
a few stronger banks which in turn have the potential of becoming
serious regional players, says Bankers Trust of Australia executive
vice-president Paul Durham.
	   `However, the merger will be more successful if the weaker banks
are taken over by the stronger ones,' he adds. `If the stronger
bank is to take over the weaker one, you can address some of the
weakness in the merged entity. As a result the bank will be
stronger, but so far that has not been the case in Malaysia.'
Durham says there are many local banks and finance companies that
need fresh capital, but he realises that the concept of foreign
capital injection into the system is one that is difficult to
embrace.
	   For the economy to recover, he says, the strong companies must
be allowed to operate and the weak, to fail. `The juggling of
assets from one entity to another is not the answer (in solving the
financial crisis).' The Australian economist was in Kuala Lumpur in
late April for the launch of Commerce-BT Lifetime Trust, a package
which offers three unit trust funds under one trust deed.

Eds: Contains items on Rwanda, Congo, Zimbabwe, South Africa
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has banned
politicians who served under the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from
standing in future elections.
	   Speaking on state-controlled television, Kabila warned members
of the former government of Zaire, now renamed Congo, that they
should quietly accept the ruling.
	   ``Otherwise, we can put them in the electric chair or throw them
in prison,'' Kabila said.
	   Last week, Kabila detained two cabinet ministers and placed
three others under house arrest.
	   Six journalists, including the state-run television head, were
also arrested in the capital, Kinshasa, apparently for their
involvement in a television report. The report showed what appeared
to be evidence of massacre of Rwandan refugees during the rebel war
that brought Kabila to power last year.
	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila and his chief
rival met face-to-face for the first time since the latter was
banished to his village for breaking a ban on political activities,
opposition activists said Tuesday.
	   Aides of Etienne Tshisekedi, Congo's foremost opposition leader,
said the two men met on Saturday in the southern town of Lubumbashi
after Kabila sent a plane to carry Tshisekedi to and from his home
village in Congo's Eastern Kasai province.
	   Tshisekedi told aides the two spoke about Congo's transition to
democracy.
	   It was not clear whether they would meet again. Tshisekedi's
aides did not know if his detention had been discussed.
	   Tshisekedi was arrested and banished in February and ordered to
carry out work in the farm fields and organize food cultivation
programs.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Kariba Lake might reach its highest
level since 1982 after years of poor inflows from the Zambezi River
and heavy water diversion to meet the hydro-electric power needs of
Zambia and Zimbabwe, says a spokesman for Kariba town publicity
association.
	   Once the largest man-made lake in the world, Kariba is one of
the major tourist attractions for landlocked Zambia and Zimbabwe,
and supports a sardine-fishing industry that provides cheap
protein.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A two-week campaign to inoculate 6
million Zimbabwean children against measles is in full swing
despite resistance from traditional African religious groups who
reject Western medication.
	   The numerous ``Vapostori'' sect, whose white-robed followers
gather at open spaces to sing and pray every weekend, warn
adherents they face the wrath of spirits if they send their
children to school or seek treatment from doctors schooled in
European medicine.
	   Despite chronic shortage of funds due to Zimbabwe's continuing
economic crisis, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare has
allocated 2.7 million Zimbabwe dollars (U.S. dlrs 150,000) to a
campaign aimed at eliminating measles, which often proves fatal to
children who are malnourished. Children under age 14 are being
inoculated as health workers visit schools and clinics.
	   Officials are considering making it a punishable offense for
parents to refuse their children inoculation.
	   In remote areas, measles-infected children are still sometimes
blinded when traditional healers tell parents to have them lie on
their backs and stare into the midday sun to be cured.
	   ------
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
discussed bilateral and regional issues with his Rwandan
counterpart, Pasteur Bizimungu, a presidential spokesman said.
	   Spokesman Joseph Bideri said without elaborating that Chiluba
and Bizimungu talked for three hours on Monday in Kigali.
	   Zambia last year supported a rebellion that toppled former
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and brought Laurent Kabila to
power.
	   Relations between Kabila's government and neighboring countries
that aided his rise to power _ including Rwanda and Uganda _ have
since been strained because they are unhappy with his rule.
	   Zambia also is among the countries enforcing an embargo against
Burundi to pressure Pierre Buyoya, who took power over the central
African country in a coup in July 1996, to negotiate with the
majority Hutu opposition.
	   Both Zambia and Rwanda have expressed doubt about the
effectiveness of the sanctions.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A trade imbalance between South
Africa and Malawi is hurting the growth of relations between the
two countries, President Nelson Mandela said Tuesday.
	   He was speaking after talks with Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi who began a three-day state visit accompanied by his foreign
affairs and commerce ministers and a large business delegation.
	   According to the latest South African trade figures, South
African exports to Malawi stood at 727 million rand (dlrs 139
million) and imports at 248 million rand (dlrs 47 million) from
January to August last year.
	   Muluzi said his visit was aimed at strengthening cooperation and
encouraging the private sector to do business.
	   South African Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad
described the bilateral relations as ``excellent'' and said the two
sides will discuss how trade can be expanded and made more
equitable.

	   IN an eleventh-hour compromise to pave way for Korn Dabaransi to
take over the Chat Pattana Party's helm, CPP secretary general
Suwat Liptapanlop Monday agreed to stay on in his post after
winning Korn's concession to partially relinquish his leadership
mandate.
	   Party sources said Korn and Suwat held a face-to-face meeting to
iron out their differences ahead of Tuesday's party meeting to
elect a new leader to succeed Chatichai Choonhavan who died of
complications from a post-cancer operation in London last month.
	   Korn and Suwat have locked horn for months over the succession
issue and Chatichai's death forced the issue to the fore. The party
executive board, at an earlier meeting convened two weeks after
Chatichai passed away, had named CPP deputy leader Arthit
Kamlang-ek as the caretaker leader, pending an agreement between
the two heirs-apparent.
	   According to party sources, Korn and Suwat focused their talks
on the party re-structuring in order to survive changes in
electoral rules as mandated by the new Constitution.
	   In a bid to win Suwat's blessing for his leadership, Korn agreed
not to excercise several privileges once given to Chatichai, they
said, adding that Korn would not, for example, insist on naming
half of the CPP executive board.
	   CPP deputy leader Wuthichai Sa-nguanwongchai commented that the
revamp of the party structure was of critical importance to the
CPP's survival and that it should supersede the power struggle.
	   ''A majority of party members view the party structure, its
operational mechanism, and their greater involvement in party
affairs as issues of more urgency than who should lead the party,''
he said.

Environmentalists demand Germany's retreat from nuclear energy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The environment minister conceded Tuesday
that Germany's nuclear energy industry is in a ``crisis of trust''
due to a safety scandal, but said Germany wouldn't heed
environmentalists' calls to abandon nuclear energy.
	   The disclosure that radiation in excess of allowed limits had
been measured seeping from nuclear waste containers sent to
processing plants in France and Britain has renewed debate about
the industry's safety.
	   Environmentalists who have long opposed the shipments renewed
their calls for the nation to abandon nuclear energy.
	   But Environment minister Angela Merkel said nuclear power
remains a workable source until solar energy and other alternative
sources become more viable.
	   The ``crisis of trust must be overcome through openness,''
Merkel was quoted by the mass-circulation Bild newspaper as saying.
	   Officials said the radiation has posed no threat to people, but
the issue sparked an election-year scandal for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government and finger-pointing about who was to blame.
	   The government suspended waste shipments abroad last month after
French and British authorities informed it that
higher-than-permitted radiation had been measured from containers
arriving at treatment plants from Germany.
	   Merkel later said the industry had known of the problem for
years but hadn't properly informed the ministry.
	   The lapse has ``severely damaged the security culture that we've
built up together in Germany,'' Merkel was quoted as saying.
	   Merkel said that the radiation problem must be solved, better
communication between France and Germany be arranged and all future
lapses be properly reported.
	   Greens and other opposition politicians claim Merkel has been
too cozy with the industry and have called for her resignation.

	   ALOR Setar Securities Sdn Bhd expects to see the injection of
RM150 million to increase its capital base, as part of steps taken
to lift the trading restrictions placed on the stockbroking firm
since Feb 18 this year.
	   Kelanamas Industries Bhd group executive director Jimmy Kon said
at a Press conference after its recent annual general meeting (AGM)
they are currently negotiating with a particular party on various
options.
	   Alor Setar Securities is a 51% subsidiary of Kelanamas Capital
Sdn Bhd, which is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kelanamas
Industries.
	   However, Kon, who is also the chief operating officer of
Kelanamas Industries, did not elaborate further on the on-going
discussion which is expected to be finalised soon.
	   A local company, which he said was not a financial institution,
had approached Alor Setar Securities on the proposed deal believed
to result in either a takeover exercise or temporary partnership.
	   `It is too early to say in what form, so we would not like to
comment at this point of time,' he added. A company official who
was also at the Press conference said: `We do not foresee a merger
(exercise) at the moment but (the discussion) is to invite a new
party to come and put in more funds and save the company.' Alor
Setar Securities was given a deadline until April 15 to come up
with a plan to regularise its financial position. However, they
received an extension of another two weeks.
	   By then, it has to submit to the Securities Commission an
agreement in principle to merge or be acquired by a third party and
within six weeks thereafter the agreement must be finalised.
Besides Alor Setar Securities, there are 11 other stockbroking
companies which are currently under trading restrictions.
	   For the financial year ended April 30, 1997, Alor Setar
Securities contributed about 80% to Kelanamas Industries' profit.
Kelanamas Industries recorded a group pre-tax profit of RM23.24
million for the 16 months ended April 30, 1997 compared with a loss
of RM13.62 million registered in the previous 15 months ended Dec
31, 1995.

U.S. media giant buys stakes in Turkish magazine chain Retransmitting to fix style on slug 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ The Hearst Corp. has bought a 25 percent
stake in a magazine chain run by one of Turkey's giant media
groups, a senior Hearst official said Tuesday.
	   Jorge Planas, the senior vice president for Hearst Magazines
International, said the company on Monday invested dlrs 4.1 million
in Bir Numara Publications.
	   Bir Numara is run by Medya Holding, one of Turkey's leading
media conglomerates, which also publishes the mass circulation
daily Sabah.
	   Hearst has been operating in Turkey with Bir Numara through a
joint-venture, Bir Numara-Hearst, since 1995. In addition to the
cash payment, the U.S firm traded its shares in the joint venture
to acquire the 25 percent stake in the Turkish company, thus
liquidating the joint venture.
	   ``Bir Numara has a good position in the Turkish market and there
is plenty of space for growth in the magazine market in Turkey,''
Planas said in a telephone interview.
	   Bir Numara publishes 36 separate magazines -- including the
Turkish versions of Cosmopolitan, Esquire, and Harper's Bazaar --
and its share of the magazine market is about 23.5 percent, daily
Sabah reported Tuesday.

	   PROPERTY transactions in 1997 grew at its slowest pace in a
decade, according to the Valuation and Property Services
Department's report on the Malaysian House Price Index for July to
December 1997. The number of transactions increased by merely 3.3%
to 175,569; in 1996 the number of transactions grew by 8.4%.
Similarly, the value of transactions for 1997 expanded at just
16.2%, as against 1996's growth of 18.6%.
	   Still, the property market did not come crashing down in the
second half of 1997 as predicted by many. Instead it remained
generally stable. What was salient was the smaller percentage
increase in volume and value. The report says this could be due to
the fact that the property market trails the general economy by
about six to nine months; hence the actual situation could be more
lethargic. This implies that only in the last quarter would the
property market begin to feel the effects of the country's economic
uncertainty that started in the second half of last year.

	   Thanks to public and private investment tallying up to 5 billion
pesos between 1995 and 1997, Mexico offers one of the highest
standards of port service in the world, said President Ernesto
Zedillo during the commemoration of Navy Day at the new port in
Altamira, Tamaulipas. On his seventh presidential tour of this
northeastern state, Zedillo said the nation's ports are the
vanguard of Mexico's economic recovery following the December 1994
crash, according to Notimex.
	   In related news, the Navy added a new type of gunner to its
Armada and launched it into the Gulf of Mexico as part of the Navy
Day celebrations, which were headed by President Ernesto Zedillo
and Navy Secretary Jose Ramon Lorenzo Franco.
	   The 907-ton, 75-meter long gunner is the first of a program
known as ``Holzinger 2000,'' and part of the nation's overall
strategy for improving its Coast Guard service. According to Navy
officials, the new ship is a weapon with enough tactical
sufficiency to pursue drug runners, illegal fishermen and
immigrants, as well as salvage wrecks and rescue civilians in
distress.
	   The keynote speaker at the ceremony was Rear Admiral Juan
Enrique Reynoso Valle, director of the Marine One Shipyard in
Tampico. The ship holds a 61 men crew and its top speed is 22
knots, or 40 kilometers an hour. The ship also has an on-deck
heliport.
	   Breaking the bottle of champagne in the ``Holzinger 2000'' was
the nation's first lady, Nilda Patricia Velazco de Zedillo, who was
the first to sign the Distinguished Visitors Book. A ceremony
starting the construction of the second ``Holzinger'' was part of
the activities.
	   Rear Admiral Reynoso praised the new gunner as the result of
Mexican research and boat development. It was fully built in the
Armada-run shipyard. Over 80 vessels, both commercial and military,
have been built in the Tampico shipyard and are a matter of pride
for Mexican maritime engineers.
	   A naval military parade ensued with the participation of 18
warships and 26 aircraft, which sailed and flew outside Tampico
Bay, where homage was paid to fallen Marines.
	   Later, President Zedillo and his entourage visited the civilian
cargo facilities and inaugurated the newly built Mexplus Terminal,
a new logistics center to operate both containers and bulk cargo
out of the nearby port of Altamira.
	   In the entourage with the president was: Defense Secretary
Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, Communications and Transport Secretary
Carlos Ruiz Sacristan, as well as Tamaulipas state civilian and
military authorities.
	   Navy Day is celebrated every year on June First since 1942 to
commemorate the June First Venustiano Carranza Administration
Constitutional amendment to nationalize the operation of ships in
national shorelines. Festivities have been held since 1942 as the
Navy Day was made an official military ceremony by then President
Manuel Avila Camacho.
	   As if to exemplify Mexico's lauded port-sector recovery, the
Navy plans on building more than 20 Holzinger patrol boats over the
next few years. The ship has been deemed by Navy officials the
keystone in the drive to add new naval gunners to increase the
nation's fire-power.

	   THAILAND plans to extradite a member of the notorious Burmese
drug warlord Khun Sa's gang to the United States following the
Appeals Court's decision Monday to uphold an earlier verdict by a
lower court.

Nimitphakphum, 71, also known as Na Chaikhui, for trafficking 1,000
to 2,000 kilogrammes of heroin to the US between 1987 to 1989.
	   The US authorities sent an official request to the Thai
government on Jan 10, 1995, asking that Chukiat be allowed to stand
trial in Pennsylvania State for smuggling heroin, worth an
estimated US$4 billion.
	   The US prosecution has filed a case with the Pennsylvania Court
alleging that Chukiat and some other accomplices trafficked heroin
into the country through Mexico.
	   Thai police arrested Chukiat on Nov 27, 1995, in his home town
of Mae Sai in Chiang Rai province. However, the accused has
vehemently denied the US charges claiming he has never been to
America or Mexico.
	   Chukiat also denied being a chemist and an expert in heroin
processing.
	   Pol Gen Phiphop Biewkhaimuk testified in court against Chukiat
saying he is an expert chemist who processed and distributed heroin
in foreign countries. The police officer said he knew the man
because he had arrested him once at the end of 1989 for possession
of opium but the accused had escaped after being granted bail.
	   Phiphop said besides the sale of drugs, Chukiat also dealt in
war weapons and manufacturing of heroin for Khun Sa's army in
Burma's Shan State.

Women may be called to arms for first time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Fearing its declining birth rate will put
it at a military disadvantage over rivals such as Turkey, Greece
has for the first time decided to train its women in the arts of
war.
	   Under legislation submitted to Parliament late Monday, the
Socialist government has proposed that women from 18 to 60 train
and serve in civil defense units for four days a year.
	   Taking more than a decade to draft, the ``Universal Defense
Plan'' hopes to increase reserve forces by nearly 20 percent. It
could also serve as a litmus test for a bigger female presence in
the military, currently reserved for professional women soldiers.
	   ``I do not disagree (with this new law)... I am under 60 years
old, I will go... It is about equality,'' said Maria Anousaki said,
a Socialist deputy.
	   All men from 18 to 60 have to serve about two years in one of
the three military branches. After completing their term, many men
serve in the reserves.
	   Greece currently has 168,000 men and women under arms, compared
to 639,000 for Turkey. With a population of 10.2 million, Greece
has a birth rate of zero, compared to a 1.7 increase for Turkey's
more than 60 million people.
	   The new law hopes to better organize reserve and national guard
forces and enlist people who have not served into civil defense
units.
	   It also calls for women to participate in the communal
protection of the country in peace and war, and during natural
disasters or other catastrophes.

Guerini wins grueling 17th stage, Pantani takes pink jersey 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: will be UPDATED
<TEXT>
	   SELVA DI VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, the best
``Giro'' climber, beat Alex Zuelle by more than four minutes in
Tuesday's grueling 17th stage of the Tour of Italy ending in the
Dolomite mountains and snatched the pink jersey of overall leader
from his Swiss rival.
	   Pantani placed second to fellow-Italian Giuseppe Guerini at the
finish line in this resort of the Gardena valley and achieved his
goal to wear the pink jersey for the first time in his career.
	   The stage victory was the first ever by Guerini at Giro
D'Italia.
	   Pantani and Guerini broke away as the road climbed to the Fedaia
pass _ the next to last in a stage including four passes - and
Zuelle quickly slid behind.
	   The leading duo widened a three-minute lead on the last mountain
before the finish _ the Giro highest point at the 2,214-meter high
Sella Pass - and Guerini won the two-way sprint at ease.
	   Zuelle, an against-the-clock specialist who had beaten Pantani
by more than three minutes in Sunday's time test at Trieste,
finished 4:37 minutes behind Tuesday and fell to fourth overall,
1:01 minutes behind the new leader.
	   Guerini completed the stage in six hours, 16 minutes, 58
seconds.
	   Pantani, who trailed Zuelle by 3:48 at the start of the 17th
stage, vaulted to first place in the standings 30 seconds ahead of
Russian Pavel Tonkov, who finished fourth in the stage.
	   Guerini moved to third, only one second behind Tonkov, a Giro
winner in 1996.
	   Pantani, 28, of the Marcatone Uno team, has the chance to
strengthen his lead in the next two stages, including mountainous
passes and uphill finishes.
	   The bald-headed Italian was a champion of bad luck in 1995 when
he suffered two consecutive bad spills and a broken leg. He was
sidelined for the entire 1996 cycling season.
	   Wednesday's stage of 115 kilometers (71.3 miles) ends at Alpe di
Pampeago at 1,760 meters of altitude.

	   UNDER attack for doing little to help the poor, Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai has chosen to announce his government's performance
on tackling the problems of the poor before announcing its
achievement on economic missions.
	   PM's Office Minister Supatra Masdit and PM's Deputy
Secretary-General Amnuay Patise said Monday that Chuan might go on
television on June 8 to announce the government's progress in
solving the problems of the poor as well as answering critics'
questions on social issues.
	   Supatra said Chuan has yet to select Cabinet members to
accompany him during the meet-the-public session.
	   She said the government would schedule an announcement on its
economic and political achievements later to mark the sixth month
of the Chuan administration's term in office.
	   The opposition, political action groups and some academics have
attacked the Chuan government for devoting its efforts to solving
only the problems of the rich.
	   Amnuay, who chairs the government's coordination committee on
the people's plight, said Chuan had asked him to compile a report
on the progress of the government's efforts to solve the problems
of the poor which had been carried out since Dec 30.
	   Amnuay said he had submitted the report on May 22 and the report
would be the basis for Chuan to explain to the public what the
government has done.
	   Supatra said government spokesman Akhapol Sorasuchart had
proposed that Chuan go public to talk about the government's
achievements in tackling the farmers' problems.
	   According to Amnuay's report, the government has set up 21
national-level committees to deal with the farmers' problems.
	   The report said a total of 444 cases of problems of farmers from
36 provinces had been put forward to the government. The problems
were divided into four groups -- debt problems, forest
encroachment, encroachment on public and Royal Household Bureau
land and land expropriation for construction of dams.
	   The report said the government has solved 75 cases or 16.89 per
cent of all the problems.
	   On the debt problems, the government has set up the national
farmers' debt restructuring committee, headed by Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.
	   On the land rights problems of villagers accused of encroaching
on forests, the national-level committees have assigned
provincial-level committees to prove the rights.
	   On the problem of villagers accused of encroaching on public and
Royal Household Bureau land, the committees are in the process of
proving the villagers' rights.
	   On the problems of villagers affected by dam construction, the
committees have set up clear-cut guidelines for paying compensation
to the villagers.

	   Former Mexican banker Angel Isidoro Rodriguez Saez, alias ``El
Divino,'' flew into Mexico City from Spain Monday following an
extradition order for his role in bank fraud, the Federal Attorney
General's Office (PGR) reported. Spanish authorities handed over
Rodriguez Saez, whose alias means ``The Divine One,'' to their
Mexican counterparts upon their arrival to the Benito Juarez
International Airport.
	   In accordance with Mexican law, Rodriguez Saez was reviewed by
representatives from the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH)
and medical examiners.
	   According to various passengers on the flight, Rodriguez Saez
was allowed liberty on the flight and was given no restrictions.
	   And although there are four arrest warrants against him, Mexican
authorities are not allowed to detain him because of injunctions
that protect him from arrest and imprisonment.
	   Former bank president Rodriguez Saez is accused of defrauding
his bank, Banpais, out of millions of dollars. He is also charged
with violating Mexico's law of credit institutions and with
violations to the law of market values, which, officials say,
gravely damaged the reputations of Mexican financial institutions
and the federal treasury. At the helm of Grupo Financiero
Banpais-Asemex, Rodriguez Saez carried out various fraudulent
financial operations, authorities say, which included loaning
himself money, making out loans to nonexistent companies and
writing unguaranteed loans to his own front men.
	   On May 22, 1998, Spain agreed to extradite Rodriguez Saez to
Mexico in connection with his role in fraudulent money exchanges at
Banpais-Asemex, which he headed until being found out by
authorities and fleeing the country in 1995.
	   At Mexico's behest, Spain detained Rodriguez Saez on July 29,
1996, beginning a 22-month extradition process.
	   On April 20, 1998, Rodriguez Saez accepted Spanish authorities'
decision to extradite and annulled all judicial resources that had
prevented Spain from handing him over legally to Mexico.

Hingis beats Williams, Davenport beats Majoli at French Open 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Williams, Davenport quotes
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing like the champion she is, Martina Hingis
ousted Venus Williams from the French Open Tuesday, ending the
American teenager's impressive run in Paris.
	   Williams, who powered her way through the first four rounds, met
her match in the world's No. 1 player and lost 6-3, 6-4 in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I didn't play as well as I should have,'' Williams said later.
``I made too many errors. These things, I assure you, will be
corrected.''
	   Of Hingis, she said, ``She's raising her game. Everyone else has
to raise theirs, too.''
	   Also eliminated was defending champion Iva Majoli, who was
beaten by No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3.
	   Davenport joked later that she might be the most overlooked
semifinalist.
	   ``If I was a betting person or a journalist, I would overlook
myself also,'' she said.
	   ``I don't have a tag. I'm just an ordinary girl playing tennis
and having success. That's a boring story.''
	   In a showdown billed worthy of a final, Hingis used her deft
touch and court sense to wear down Williams. She almost always
seemed in control, never looking off balance or rushed.
	   Hingis raced to a 3-0 lead, but Williams broke in the fifth game
for 3-2 as Hingis twice double-faulted. Hingis then broke right
back for 4-2, and held on to win the set.
	   In the second set, Williams had a chance to break Hingis for
2-0, racking up three break points. But Hingis won five straight
points to take the game.
	   In the crucial game of the set, Hingis broke Williams for 4-3 _
again on two double faults, this time by Williams.
	   Also reaching the semifinals was Aranxta Sanchez Vicario, the
No. 4 seed. The two-time champion from Spain lost a tiebreak in the
second set but recovered to beat Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-2,
6-7 (5-7), 6-0.
	   But another former champion, Thomas Muster, continued a
disappointing year with a quarterfinal loss to No. 15 Felix
Mantilla of Spain, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. The Austrian's ranking has
dropped this past year from ninth to 22nd.
	   Leading to the headline match, Hingis wasn't ready to call
Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
said. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.
... I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.
	   Marat Safin, an 18-year-old qualifier, used his power to carve
his way through the first three rounds. His tournament ended on
Monday, however, in five tough sets.
	   The French fans chanted wildly for his opponent, Frenchman
Cedric Pioline. ``Allez Cedric!'' they yelled. But as the match
wore on, there were growing chants of ``Ma-RAT! Ma-RAT!''
	   It was in tribute to the remarkable run by the young Russian
playing his first Grand Slam event. He began the tournament ranked
116th in the world, but won't be there much longer.
	   ``I think I can beat good players now,'' he said after Pioline
won 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4.
	   Safin's tournament started with three qualifying matches just to
get into the main draw.
	   Next up was Andre Agassi, in the midst of a strong comeback.
Safin, however, had the answer to every problem Agassi presented.
Then he ousted defending champion Gustavo Kuerten, ranked eighth in
the world, in another five-setter.
	   In the third round, Safin had a slightly easier time, needing
only four sets to beat Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.
	   That set up the match with Pioline. The 28-year-old Frenchman is
erratic, but brilliant on occasion. He has reached the finals of
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, both times losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Pioline has a reputation for choking. Although he has reached 12
singles finals in his career, he has captured only two titles.
Safin, however, knew nothing of that.
	   ``Nobody told me,'' he said.
	   It didn't matter. This time it was Safin who unraveled. Pioline
broke the Russian's serve three times, including once in the fifth
set. That was enough.

	   LESIGNY, France _ Romario was dropped Tuesday from Brazil's
World Cup team.
	   Brazil's hero of the 1994 World Cup-winning team, Romario was
not included because of an injury to his right calf muscle.
	   Midfielder Emerson of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen has was
called in to replace Romario.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo made a brief announcement at the team's
training headquarters and then turned the press conference over to
Romario, who was choked with tears and had trouble speaking.
	   ``Things are happy for some, sadness for others. But now I think
you're all sad as I am. I don't want to mean this is a farewell
from soccer,'' he said.
	   After breaking down again and covering his face with his hands,
Romario said: ``I will now probably learn how to value other
things.''
	   ___  
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne says he was drunk the night before
he was cut from the England World Cup team and that he went berserk
when coach Glenn Hoddle gave him the news.
	   The 31-year-old midfielder, who was dropped Sunday by Hoddle for
a lack of fitness, spoke about the incident in a story in Tuesday's
Sun newspaper.
	   Gascoigne, who has been criticized for his reported
hard-drinking and smoking 20 cigarettes a day, said he left the bar
in La Manga, Spain, had sandwiches in his room with teammate David
Seaman, and then ``crashed out.''
	   Gascoigne also said he had been drinking beer during a Sunday
golf game just hours before he met with Hoddle.
	   Given the bad news, the star of England's 1990 World Cup team
admitted he exploded.
	   ``I completely lost it. I went mad, berserk. I lost my rag big
time. I was shouting and swearing. I couldn't believe the injustice
of it.''
	   ___  
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran dropped two veteran strikers but added
two rookies to its 22-man World Cup squad announced Tuesday.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi sacked veteran strikers Alireza Emamifar and
Alireza Akbarpour to make way for newcomers, 22-year-old striker
Ali Latifi and 24-year-old midfielder Sattar Hamedani. Both rookies
play for local club Bahman.
	   Iran's three Bundesliga players, Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and
Khodadad Azizi, were included in the roster as was top goalkeeper
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh.
	   The team is in Croatia and will play a warmup against the
country's national team Wednesday before leaving for France.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Saeid Al Owairan, who scored the
most spectacular goal of the last World Cup, will be frightening
defenders at this one too.
	   Especially now that he looks like Ronaldo.
	   Al Owairan, whose weaving run through the Belgian defense earned
the Saudis a 1-0 victory in Washington, now has the Ronaldo
shaven-headed look.
	   ``I shaved all my hair off myself a couple of days ago because
it kept getting in my eyes,'' said the forward.
	   The Saudis are in action on the third day of the World Cup June
12, when they face Denmark in Lens.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA president Joao Havelange and World Cup
co-organizer Michel Platini are used to having the media chasing
them.
	   This time it was Havelange and Platini who went to the media
when they formally opened the World Cup press center Friday.
	   ``It's a symbolic inauguration because it's the first of the 11
sites to open its doors officially,'' said World Cup co-president
Platini. ``It is also the first symbol of five years work by the
organizing committee.''
	   Havelange said his thoughts were with the other co-president,
Fernand Sastre, who missed the ceremony because of ill health.
	   ``I have known Fernand Sastre for 50 years,'' he said. ``As
president of the French soccer federation he was responsible for
organizing the European Championship in 1984 and that was the first
move towards bringing the World Cup to France.''
	   ___  
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea has opted for a mixture
age and youth for its World Cup team, naming teenage rookie Lee
Dong-hook alongside veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong on its 22-man
roster.
	   Hwang, 29, South Korea's most famous player, returned to the
national team in April after a two-year break due to knee injury.
He has since scored three goals in seven World Cup warmup matches.
	   Forward Lee Dong-kook was the surprise selection. At 19, Lee
became the youngest South Korean ever to join the national soccer
team. Coach Cha Bum-keun said he was taking the rookie to France to
train him as South Korea's next-generation star.
	   ___
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Cameroon announced Tuesday its final
World Cup squad, including some veterans, a new generation of
attackers _ and few surprises.
	   An expected omission from the team is Marc Vivien Foe, a
standout midfielder with French champion Lens, who broke his leg in
training in late May during the buildup to the World Cup.
	   Unexplained in his absence, however, was Tockene Bertin, a
defender expected to be a starter for the Indomitable Lions.
	   Veteran goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o, who plays for Deportivo La
Coruna in Spain, will anchor the team along with striker Francois
Omam-Biyick of Sampdoria in Italy.
	   Key young faces include attackers Alphonse Tchami of Hertha
Berlin in Germany and Salomon Olembe of Nantes in France.
	   ___  
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One of the biggest names in Japanese soccer was
dropped from the World Cup team Tuesday.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada said Kazuyoshi Miura, 31, would have no
chance to play, considering the team's ``pillar striker'' is
22-year-old Shoji Jo.
	   The announcement at the team's training camp in Switzerland is a
severe blow to Miura, the only Japanese to have ever played in
Italy's Serie A.
	   Ever since he was a teenager who went to Brazil to study soccer,
Miura had his heart set on taking Japan to the World Cup.
	   He was one of the key members of the Japanese team that failed
to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He scored a spectacular 14 goals
in qualifiers for this year's World Cup _ Japan's first.

	   AFTER several years in overdrive, the Malaysian motor industry
has swerved into the slow lane since the third quarter of 1997.
	   Reason: last year the industry received several blows which
bridled the horsepower of the sector. `A series of new government
guidelines limiting credit availability to car buyers and an
increase of duties on foreign luxury cars coupled with a sluggish
economy have caused the industry to suffer a significant drop in
sales,' says Wong Si Si, analyst at Kuala Lumpur City Securities
Sdn Bhd (KLCS).
	   Analysts say car sales have dropped some 60% to 70% since
November last year. The Malaysian Motor Traders Association
forecasts sales for 1998 to be a paltry 160,000 cars compared with
1997's 404,800.
	   Investors dumped their motor stocks on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) which by the end of 1997 were trading at 70% to 85%
below their January prices. Prices fell even more early this year,
and analysts expect further price weakening.
	   The main culprit, analysts say, was the difficulty in obtaining
end-financing. In the 1998 Budget, the credit ceiling for hire
purchase of passenger cars was reduced to 70% with repayment
limited to five years.
	   (Previously the credit limit was capped at 75% of the vehicle
cost, with a maximum of eight years to repay the loan.) But in
reality, the credit squeeze is much worse. As an analyst with a
foreign research house points out, `The actual scenario is that
many finance companies are only offering financing for up to 60%
the cost of vehicles. Credit shortage will be a major obstacle to
any sales increase.' Last month the government stepped in to help,
by upping the credit limit to 85% for cars priced at RM40,000 and
below. One reason for this measure, analysts say, is to cushion the
national car industry and keep it from collapsing. `The main
beneficiaries of this move are Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd
(Proton) and its distributor Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd (EON) as
well as Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua) whose models
are mostly priced within that range,' says the analyst.
	   The result: EON's sales jumped 62.3% to 3,782 units in March
this year from 2,330 units in February, helped along by a small
discount on car prices.
	   But this may only be a temporary reprieve. Wong of KLCS says the
ruling will not change banks' prudence in approving loans. In March
1997 Bank Negara had directed all financial institutions to limit
their lending to non-productive sectors of the economy, which
includes the motor industry.
	   Taking heed, banks and finance companies have adopted more
stringent lending policies, resulting in lesser loans being given
out for the purchase of cars.
	   Foreign car sales are in a worse state: the 1998 Budget
increased the already heavy duties they were under. Import duty on
CBU (Completely Built Up) cars were raised from between 140% and
200% to between 140% and 300%, while duty on CKD (Completely
Knocked Down) cars grew from 42% to a maximum of 80%. An analyst
notes that on a year-to-year basis for March, car sales for Nissan
has dropped 75%, Toyota by 79.5% and Mercedes Benz by 79.8%, as
compared to sales of Proton and Perodua which have declined 73% and
52.4% respectively.
	   A rising interest rate environment has also made it more
expensive to buy cars. Hire purchase rates were raised on several
occasions in 1997.
	   From the initial 7% (as at August 1995), rates climbed to 8% in
October 1997 and to 8.5% a month later. The last change took effect
on Dec 1, when hire purchase rates were hiked up to 10%.
	   The move, while needed to mop up excess liquidity in the
financial system, would naturally affect car sales. `Despite the
current and expected discounts on the national cars, this is partly
offset by the buyer having to pay more interest,' says an analyst.
	   Another variable in the motor industry is the Ringgit's value
vis-a-vis the Japanese Yen, to which car manufacturers have a
fairly large exposure.
	   Although the Ringgit's depreciation of some 18% against the Yen
since the beginning of the year should mean rising costs for car
makers, assemblers and importers in Malaysia, the effects are not
immediate as most motor companies have reasonably large stockpiles.
`They have locked in their supply of raw materials when the Ringgit
was stronger,' says one.
	   Case in point: Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd (Tan Chong) has
RM528 million in assembled motor vehicles, which analysts say would
cover supply for the next six months.
	   But should sales remain bleak, motor stocks on the KLSE will
remain underweight. `The price earnings (PE) of the sector is
undemanding at 5.9 times for financial year 1998 and reflects the
earnings risk,' says the analyst. `Going by past trends the current
drop (in sales) should bottom out by the end of 1998. In the last
recession, car sales fell by 20%, but this time around it has
fallen by 60%. Going by this, earnings of motor companies are
expected to fall by 60-70% in financial year 1998.' Deteriorating
profit margins have already begun to show up in financial year 1997
balance sheets. For instance, Tan Chong registered only a 2%
increase in pre-tax profit - and this surpassed analysts' forecast.
UMW Holdings' pre-tax profit rose only 4.6% while EON recorded a
pre-tax drop of 4.9% in 1997 despite the increased sales of Proton
cars.
	   One company which bucked the trend was Cycle  Carriage which
reported a 24% rise in pre-tax profit for financial year 1997, but
this came mainly from an increased contribution from its associate
companies.
	   Keeping costs low is now crucial for the survival of motor
companies.
	   `Companies will now have to sharpen their competitiveness. As
players fight for a shrinking market share, innovative marketing
strategies will aid in drawing buyers,' says Wong.
	   As for stock-to-stock analysis, Proton is expected to do better
than the rest because of its dominant role in the market. Proton
has the cash -close to RM1.4 billion - but it also has short- and
long-term liabilities.
	   In addition, Proton plans to introduce a new model to replace
the Iswara which will involve a capital expenditure of RM500
million. `The current cash pile has its uses, but much of it has
been earmarked for other purposes, which means Proton may feel the
heat of the current downturn,' says the analyst.
	   For the current financial year, its factories are running at
more than 50% under capacity. The Proton facility in Shah Alam
alone is designed to produce 230,000 units a year. DRB-Hicom has
another plant in Pekan, which produces Proton variants like the
Satria and Wira Aeroback. For the current financial year, the group
is looking at a combined production of 110,000 units.
	   In the case of EON, analysts believe that it has the ability to
withstand the huge drop in earnings. Explains Wong, `Unlike other
automotive counters, EON solely handles the distribution and the
sales of Proton cars, and does not dabble in vehicle assembly. This
means that overheads may be easier to control, and it is not a
victim of the vagaries of currency fluctuations.' The company is
also diversified but most of its operations are bleeding due to the
downturn. EON is exposed to the delicate financial sector - through
subsidiary EON Bank and 30% associate, Leong and Co - which
analysts say will slow down its profits.
	   EON's other interests are in Mobikom and Singapore-based CCL
Group, both of which, say analysts, are not doing well.
	   As these are testing times for the luxury car market, Cycle 
Carriage is expected to be the worst hit. Even though CC has low
gearing -its net debt-to-equity ratio is minimal at 0.5% for
financial year 1996 -it has only RM2 million in cash and
equivalents at the end of financial year 1996.
	   `Its relatively weak cash position as compared to other motor
stocks makes it an unattractive investment as sales have dropped by
more than 50%,' says the analyst. `In comparison, Tan Chong has a
cash hoard of RM310.5 million as at the end of financial year 1996,
Oriental Holdings, RM793 million, and UMW, RM267.8 million.' Help
from an associate company, the CCI Group Properties, is also not
expected to be much. While CCI was the main profit contributor to
CC's bottom line in financial year 1997, analysts say its core
activities - property development in Singapore and property
investment in Malaysia - are not doing well because of a slump in
property prices.
	   `The property market in Singapore has softened, with condominium
prices having fallen by more than 20%. In fact we expect progress
billing to be delayed and interest income to fall in the face of
slower sales and tough operating environment,' adds the analyst.
	   CC recently shut down its plant for three months beginning in
April and analysts wonder what's in store. `Will CC have to
retrench?' asks one.
	   Tan Chong is more favoured by analysts. `Tan Chong's cash
reserves of over RM300 million coupled with its low net
debt-to-equity ratio, which stood at 1.1% in 1996, makes the
company cash rich,' explains Wong. `It will therefore be able to
withstand the slowdown in motor sales.' The company, he adds,
emerged unscathed from the last recession and `with its experienced
management team, we believe that Tan Chong will do the same this
time around.' Another plus point for the company is the
postponement of its listing.
	   `This will conserve its cash pile as Tan Chong will not need to
make the cash repayment of RM0.70 per share which will total
RM470.4 million on the demerger,' says Wong.
	   But with the debut of the country's national truck this year,
Hicom-MTB will give Nissan's commercial vehicles a run for its
money. Says Wong, `As these vehicles will be sold at RM7,000 to
RM9,000 less than other non-national commercial trucks, we
anticipate that Hicom-MTB will manage to gain top spot for the
commercial vehicle segment, taking over Nissan's position which it
has held for two years running.' As for UMW Holdings Bhd, analysts
believe that its exposure to the national car segment through
Perodua may insulate it from a severe drop in sales of higher-end
vehicles. UMW has a 38% interest in Perodua and for financial year
1997, Perodua contributed 30.5% to UMW's pre-tax profit.
	   Toyota's commercial vehicle segment would face greater
challenges in regaining its number one spot from Nissan in 1998,
with the emergence of the national truck. `It is likely that UMW
Toyota will sell only an average of 200 units of commercial
vehicles a month, translating into a fall of 76.7% on a
year-to-year basis,' says an analyst.
	   Analysts note that UMW has learnt from the 1986 recession when
it almost folded. `This time around they are relying less on debt
and can draw on the strength of an experienced management team,'
says an analyst. `UMW had a gearing ratio of 56.3% as at the end of
financial year 1996, while its cash and cash equivalents stood at
RM267.8 million. We believe UMW may emerge from the slump in sales
better than the last recession.'

	   NOBODY knows for sure when the next general election will be
called. But some politicians have begun actively campaigning,
especially in the Northeast.
	   A few weeks after ex-premier Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's visit to
northeastern provinces, his wife Khunying Phankrua Yongchaiyudh
donated Bt200,000 from the New Aspiration Party pocket to the Lunch
for the Poor Fund.
	   She also gave another Bt24,000 from her own pocket to the fund,
which was initiated by Her Majesty the Queen.
	   After the donation, she wasted no time in campaigning for her
husband. She told reporters that Chavalit had devoted himself for
the betterment of society. ''And I would like to ask the government
to concentrate on the poor, in addition to the rich,'' she said.
	   ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul
continues to launch new projects to make the city a better place to
live.
	   Recently he unveiled the ''Riding Bicycle to School'' project,
which is aimed at encouraging schoolchildren to travel to and from
school on bikes. The pilot project will begin on Pradit Manutham
Road, where there is a 24-kilometre bike lane.
	   By focusing on children in the pilot project, Bhichit hopes
adults will follow suit.
	   HIS obsession with doomsayer Nostradamus's prophecies is no
longer a secret. Veteran actor Santisuk Promsiri recently admitted
that he is among those who believe in doomsday.
	   To survive the catastrophe, Santisuk says, he has bought 10 rai
of land in Chiang Rai, where his new house is under construction.
He also plans to use the land for farming.
	   ''Yes, I believe in the prophecy. I have to get prepared for the
destruction,'' he said. Also believing in the ''great flood'',
Santisuk decided to buy a boat to be used when the world is
inundated.
	   THE government's two economic czars are off on overseas trips
again. Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda will shortly leave
for Tokyo to attend an economic forum on the Asian economic crisis
organised by Nikkei. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will
also be present.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi will be
in Australia in mid-month as a guest speaker on a similar topic.
The event is organised by the International Herald Tribune.
	   TREVOR Allen, general manager of the Pacific City Club since it
was founded, has moved on. Beginning on June 1, Allen has become
managing director of Delaney's Irish Pub on Convent Road, off
Silom. He was one of Delaney's first investors when the pub began
its expansion from its Hong Kong base into Thailand several years
ago.
	   Now with two successful pubs, the other in Pattaya, Allen's
investment group sees some opportunities even in the current
economic environment.

	   DATUK Adzmi Abdul Wahab, 56, managing director of Edaran
Otomobil Malaysia (EON), would have been equally at home in the
civil service as he is in the automobile industry. Back in 1967,
this unassuming man joined the Malaysian Administrative and
Diplomatic Service and worked in various capacities in the Ministry
of Finance, Pahang Tenggara Development Authority and the Prime
Minister's Department.
	   Fifteen years later, he left to become HICOM's manager of
corporate planning. In 1985, he joined Proton where he was head of
the administrative and finance division, before going on to EON.
	   In February 1992, Adzmi, who has a BA (Hons) degree from
Universiti Malaya and an MBA from the University of Southern
California, was appointed to the board of EON. He was appointed as
managing director in November that year. In a recent interview with
Investors Digest, Adzmi discusses EON's plans and strategies in
meeting the challenges of today and the future. Excerpts: On the
position of EON in the 21st Century when the WTO liberalisation
regulations come into effect We are taking measures to ensure that
EON will be in a good position to compete, come 2003, by improving
efficiency and cutting cost. This year, we plan to cut costs by 30%
and improve productivity. Our average sales growth since 1985 has
been at the rate of 18.5%, higher than the national average for the
same period. Besides, we are in a position to compete as we have
the largest network of sales and after-sales service in the
country.
	   The car market in the 21st Century would depend a lot on the
economic conditions. The current situation is temporary. Some say
recovery is expected within the next two years. How fast we recover
depends on how the entire economy responds and what policies are
adopted by the Government.
	   Malaysia will emerge stronger after this economic slowdown.
Companies will be more lean. So we expect the demand of cars to
continue rising over the long term. We will innovate and go for
strong AP (advertising and promotions) to continue to strengthen
our sales and after-sales services to ensure success.
	   On the reasons for not combining EON and USPD service centres We
have these two outfits separated because this will foster
competition. And this will keep us on our toes as well. USPD
concentrates on sporty cars while we do more sedans. There is no
possibility of a merger right now. But of course, anything is
possible in the future.
	   On the training and development of its sales personnel We are
conducting courses in salesmanship and customer relations. We are
placing more emphasis now on customer satisfaction. But we have
experienced tough times in 1985, 1986 and 1987 when we had to go
from house to house to look for customers. Now we just have to
retrain our people and go to the customers more aggressively.
	   On Motoria (EON's reconditioned and used car outfit) Motoria's
concept of autofair has been a success. In the Klang Valley, we
have organised fairs in Subang. We have also held similar fairs in
Penang and Alor Star. The idea is to introduce branded used cars
stressing on quality. Most cars we refurbish are given a one-year
warranty. However, we are not totally concentrating on used cars
because that market is still dominated by the Japanese makes, which
are cheaper.
	   On the correlation between new and used car markets There is
difficulty in acquiring financing for used cars. We have proposed
to the Government to relax financing for used cars as well since
the used car mart correlates with the brand new market. About 60%
of the people who buy new cars trade in their old ones. If people
can't get good prices, then they may be reluctant to sell their
cars and this will make it difficult for us to market new cars.

Romania seeks to collect billions of dollars in unpaid debts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania has begun efforts to collect
nearly dlrs 3 billion in unpaid debt left over from the communist
era, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   ``One of our main priorities is to recover this money,'' said
spokeswoman Anda Filip after dailies published a list of 14
countries still owing money from goods imported before the
anti-communist revolt of 1989.
	   Iraq, Syria, Libya, Zambia, Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea are
the largest debtors.
	   At dlrs 1.7 billion, Iraq owes the most. Baghdad served notice
it would not pay, after Romania joined a U.N. embargo against it in
1990.
	   Filip said meetings with the countries concerned had brought no
results but efforts to collect would continue.

	   A REDUCTION of petrol prices in the world market and a stronger
baht have led to a cut in domestic diesel and petrol prices by
Bt0.70 and Bt0.30 a litre respectively, effective from Tuesday.
	   This is the first time that private oil companies, led by Esso
(Thailand), have brought down the price instead of the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand.
	   The retail petrol price will be Bt12.31 per litre for octane 95
petrol; Bt11.67 a litre for octane 91 petrol; Bt11.25 a litre for
octane 87 petrol; and Bt8.70 a litre for diesel.
	   Metta Bunteungsuk, deputy secretary-general of the National
Energy Policy Office (Nepo), said the petrol price reduction was a
result of a weakening of worldwide petrol prices by US$3 per barrel
to $18.50 and a reduction in the price of diesel by $3.50 a barrel
to $18.50 a barrel.
	   Also, the baht's value in May strengthened by around Bt1 per US
dollar. Therefore, the total cost of petrol and diesel has been
reduced by Bt0.80 a litre and Bt0.95 a litre, respectively.
	   Metta said the big drop in petrol prices is due to fierce
competition in the wholesale petrol market.
	   An executive vice president of Mobil Oil Co, Lance E Johnson,
said Monday the current world crude oil overhang, which has
increased as a result of the Asian economic crisis, will likely
persist through to 2000.
	   ''The likely situation is some deferrals of capacity expansions
and moderate Opec control resulting in a continuation of the status
quo, at least in the near term, with prices remaining in the $14 to
$16 per barrel range,'' Johnson said.
	   Although Mobil still expects Asian oil demand to grow at almost
twice the rate of the rest of the world, it has lowered its
estimate of annual demand growth in Asia over the next five years
from 4 per cent to 2.7 per cent, or 1.4 million barrels per day in
2002 less than it forecast eight months ago, he said.
	   Mobil currently estimates Asian oil demand will grow to 22.3
million b/d in 2002, from 19.5 million b/d in 1997.
	   Even noting that the recent Asian economic downturn is just a
temporary pause in long term demand growth, Johnson insisted price
weakness will likely continue unless significantly more production
comes off the market.

Forgotten bombing returns to haunt Botha 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-South Africa-Botha Trial
By PAUL HARRIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ On Tuesday, the Aug. 31, 1988,
bombing of the South African Council of Churches came back to haunt
former President P.W. Botha.
	   Standing a few feet away from Botha, 82, ex-security guard
Welcome Ntumba described the night the bomb tore through the foyer
of the building.
	   ``I heard something, a very big noise like lightning,'' he said,
speaking in Zulu through an interpretor. ``I just saw the walls
collapsing and the electricity went off.''
	   A former national police chief has told the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that Botha authorized the bombing of
Khotso House, where the church's offices were located.
	   The blast sent Ntumba plummeting into the basement. He escaped
almost unharmed. No one was killed and only a handful of people
were injured in the blast.
	   Botha, wearing a dark suit, shifted in his seat to look directly
at Ntumba as the small, stocky black man told how he was pulled
from the rubble by passersby and taken to a hospital.
	   The Rev. Peter Storey, a former head of South Africa's Methodist
Church, arrived at Khotso House after the blast and described to
the court a scene of fallen masonry, shattered glass and smoldering
fires.
	   ``We were met by a scene out of hell,'' he recalled.
	   Botha has denied he authorized the bombing.
	   Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before the Truth
Commission, which is investigating apartheid-era human rights
abuses.

	   TIMES have certainly altered the clear and distinct path
Malaysia's automobile industry used to cruise on. The days when the
industry's sales per month effortlessly touched five figures is a
far cry from its present predicament, where monthly sales have
dwindled to below 10,000 units.
	   Certainly the spell when buyers of certain marques and models
had to wait for more than six months to take delivery of their
cars, is past.
	   Nowadays, car salesmen will be grateful if they can sell just
one car a month, with virtually all promising instant delivery of
the vehicles.
	   Apparently, the regional currency and economic woes have
affected the motor industry. Credit tightening measures on the hire
purchase financing of cars have put a further damper on sales.
	   The industry, which had an average growth rate of 14.5% from
1985 onwards, gazes at gloomy prospects in 1998. Total industry
volume, including passenger cars, commercial and 4X4 vehicles,
stood at 404,837 units in 1997. However, official statistics
released by the Malaysian Motor Traders Association (MMTA) indicate
that only 160,000 units will be sold in 1998. This means that 60%
of motor vehicle sales are going to be wiped out of the market this
year. The used-car market, which faces even more stringent
conditions like tighter financing terms, has also suffered a blow,
shedding more than 30% of its value since July 1997.
	   Therefore, the industry's powers-that-be have been scurrying
around to maintain, if not increase, their market presence.
Adoption of savvy marketing strategies have become more critical
than ever to push sales in adverse economic conditions. Edaran
Otomobil Nasional (EON), which markets and distributes Proton
Iswara, Wira (sedan) and the Perdana range, was one of the first to
embark on an advertising and promotions (AP) blitz.
	   `We have taken various measures to stimulate demand. We have
gone through aggressive advertising, including dropping the Wira on
the North Pole during the North Pole Expedition recently. This is
part of our strategy to show how strong our cars are. The car could
start after it reached the ground even in that freezing
temperature,' says the managing director of EON, Datuk Adzmi Abdul
Wahab.
	   But more importantly, the company came up with a bold pricing
strategy for the Iswara 1.3S Aeroback. Commencing April 1, 1998,
the model was offered for sale at RM29,683 without accessories, but
inclusive of excise duty, sales tax and air-conditioner.
	   `This scheme is aimed at making it more affordable for customers
to buy the Iswara. In an economic slowdown, people have less money.
So, we decided to go with the no-frills version by attaching a
RM29,000 price tag. In the past they had to take the six standard
accessories, but now they have a choice,' says Adzmi.
	   The strategy seems to have paid off handsomely. `Within a month,
we managed to increase the sales of Iswara Aeroback,' says Adzmi.
`It exceeded 3,000 units in April, which is 192% more than the
previous month.' He finds that rather ironic. When the industry was
on the roll, EON was selling more of the Wira range, which was of a
higher price. `But now, due to the downturn, we can see a more
pronounced demand for the lower range models. We expect to sell
more Iswaras this year.' He believes the overwhelming response to
the new scheme is no fluke and expects the brisk sales to continue.
`Now is the best time for buyers to purchase cars because I don't
see car prices staying low for long,' says Adzmi. `This is because
of the pressure on cost generated by the weakening of the Ringgit.
The duration of our current offer depends on the manufacturer,
DRB-Hicom. As long as it continues to give the cars at that price,
we will continue with the scheme. But the cost pressure is there -
with the fluctuating Ringgit and rising prices of auto components.
	   Although Proton is still maintaining its current prices, we
don't know how long this will last.' The no-frills scheme has
another objective. Adzmi points out that the slashed prices for
Iswara will bring more customers to the showrooms, and he hopes
that some of the visitors will also be tempted to buy the other
Proton cars, perhaps the more expensive ones.
	   Another national car has adopted the same strategy as well.
Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua), which manufactures the
Kancil range, knocked down the price of the EXB model to below
RM20,000, to bolster sales. The 659 cc, four-speed, manual model is
sold at RM19,980. The limited edition model, however, comes without
an air-conditioner, and accessories like alarm, central lock, radio
and cassette player, glove box, dashboard tray, body side protector
strap and wheel-caps.
	   Does EON view this as a threat? `I don't think so because they
are in a different segment at the range of RM20,000. Ours, on the
other hand, is at the price range of RM29,000 and above, with
higher cylinders. And at that price, there's good value for money,'
says Adzmi.
	   The non-national carmakers, however, do not have the luxury of
slashing prices. Says an executive from a non-national car
franchise-holder, `We can't do that. We can't simply cut prices
because our costs, in the form of duties, are high. Besides, banks
are charging very high interest rates on loans. A lot has been
given to the national cars, but nothing much for us.' He estimates
that most car companies at present would have at least 10 months'
stockpile of unsold cars. `And that's January's estimate. Unsold
stocks would have increased to a higher level by now. In fact
before the crisis set in, the whole non-national passenger car
segment could sell almost 20,000 to 30,000 units per month, but now
we can chalk up maybe 6,000 units.' So, what can the non-national
car franchisees do in the wake of this slowdown? `Well, we are
doing our best,' says a non-national car company executive who
requested anonymity. `The worst of the lot are companies selling
luxury cars. At the moment, they are implementing some cost-
cutting measures. In terms of layoffs, we are sending back only the
foreigners. But we are not retrenching locals because if we do
that, it is going to be very difficult to get them back when the
good times return.
	   That's why what Cycle  Carriage did is laudable.' Cycle 
Carriage Bintang Bhd, which is Malaysia's sole distributor of the
upmarket Mercedes Benz, adopted an innovative scheme to reduce the
burden on the company as well as its workers when it temporarily
shut down its production plant due to the slowdown. Instead of
retrenching its 435 production workers, the company requested them
to go on three months' paid leave from April 1 at 75% of their
basic salary, and a RM50 monthly attendance allowance. The workers
on leave are permitted to seek non- permanent employment during
this period to supplement their income. The scheme earned kudos
from various quarters, including Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim
Ah Lek.
	   Average sales in the passenger car industry for the last five
years were 218,400 units. There has been a steady increase in sales
since 1987, after the mid-80s economic crisis, peaking at 307,907
units last year. The gloomy forecast for 1998 can be attributed to
the loss of consumer confidence and uncertainty caused by some
macroeconomic factors, namely the weakening of the Ringgit, which
shed 43% against the US dollar and 36% against the Yen, compared to
July 1997. The fall of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) and
the downward revision of the 1998 gross domestic product (GDP) from
7% to 2-3% also played a part.
	   Besides, funds for end-financing has been reduced because of the
squeeze on credit growth from 25% in 1997 to 15% in 1998. The
higher hire-purchase interest rates, from 6.5% in July 1997 to more
than 10% at present, has also hit the market badly. Meanwhile, the
substantially steeper duties for bigger capacity passenger cars,
especially for completely-built-up (CBU) models, have further
dampened enthusiasm.
	   Sales figures for the first three months of this year weren't
encouraging. Total passenger car sales for January, February and
March were 9,775 units, 5,641 units and 7,350 units respectively.
The February figures were probably the lowest monthly sales
recorded in recent years.
	   If a ballpark estimation were to be made from the average of the
first three months - 7,589 units - the volume of sales is
insufficient to reach the 1998 forecast of 130,000 units.
	   `To revive the car market, we believe in focusing on and talking
about the positive aspects to stimulate sminimum downpayment was
increased to 30%. However, following recommendations from the
National Economic Council (NEAC), prospective buyers are now
allowed to secure up to 85% credit from finance companies when
purchasing new cars below RM40,000. Besides that, EON announced on
April 23 that all loans for all new Proton cars taken from its
panel of finance companies will enjoy an interest rate of 9.5%,
compared with the 10% previously.
	   However, these measures have caused concern among certain
quarters in the industry. Many feared that the moves would attract
unscrupulous syndicates due to the easy access to loans. These
syndicates, according to industry observers, could purchase a
substantial number of cars, and then take them apart to illegally
sell their components. In the final stage, the advocates of the
scam will report the car missing or damaged, and make claims from
their insurance companies. At the end of the day, the finance and
insurance companies as well as genuine prospective buyers, will
lose out.
	   But Adzmi argues that the screening process carried out by
finance companies is tighter now. `Not every Tom, Dick and Harry
can get car loans so easily, especially these days,' he says.
`Anyhow, there may be one or two cases - it is not rampant.' The
benefits of increased loans will not trickle down to the non-
national car segment. `The increase in hire-purchase financing to
up to 85% for cars below RM40,000 will be a boon for the national
cars. But for the non-national segment, virtually none of them are
at that price. The Government should consider the plight of this
segment as well because they are also hit by the economic
slowdown,' says an analyst.
	   In terms of passenger car market share, the national car segment
continues to hold the fort (see table). The Proton range of cars,
distributed by EON continues to be the leader, accounting for half
the market share in 1996, dropping to 45.8% in 1997. In fact,
Proton's slice of the automotive cake has been dropping since it
peaked at 74.1% in 1993.
	   This is because part of the market since then is shared with
Kancil and the Proton range of cars distributed by EON's sister
company, Usahasama Proton-DRB (USPD). USPD, which distributes the
Wira Aeroback, the Satria, the Putra and the Tiara, commanded 18.1%
and 13.8% of the market in 1997 and 1996, respectively, while the
Kancil conquered 18.9% and 17% of the market in 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
	   In the non-national segment, Honda leads the pack, dominating
6.4% and 6.6% of the car market in 1997 and 1996. Toyota comes in
second, claiming 3% and 3.8% of the pie in 1997 and 1996. Nissan
held 2.7% and 2.5% of the market share in 1997 and 1996. In the
Continental car segment, Mercedes Benz has apparently quashed
traditional rival BMW, holding 1.4% and 1.6% of the respective
segments in 1997 and 1996. BMW managed to maintain 0.9% for both
years.
	   While waiting for the local market to recover, the national
carmakers are trying to spread their wings overseas. Perodua is
currently awaiting the results of a feasibility study for the
setting up of left-hand drive assembly operations in Egypt, its
biggest market in West Asia. The Kancil is already exported to
Brunei, Malta, Mauritius, Cyprus, Fiji, Sri Lanka, the United
Kingdom, Comoros Island and Egypt and has been signed up for
distribution in Lebanon and Jordan. The DRB-Hicom group,
manufacturers of the Proton range, is expecting to export at least
52,000 units in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. The United
Kingdom, Germany and Australia will continue to be the group's main
export markets.

The beginning is nigh: host players bid farewell to family 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ One thing is clear when even the
host players bid farewell to their wives and kids and promise to
stay away as long as possible _ the World Cup is upon us.
	   Coming off three final days with family and friends, the French
players gathered at their castle-training camp in the lush
Rambouillet woods outside Paris Tuesday, hopefully to stay together
until the July 12 final.
	   ``Now the family can sleep, eat, and not have any worries,''
said French star Zinedine Zidane, who spent the long Pentecost
weekend going for walks with his wife and child.
	   Some of the 22 players were expected to arrive late because of
the Air France strike, but that was only a small worry at
Clairfontaine castle.
	   Right from the start Tuesday the place was buzzing with rumors
how coach Aime Jacquet might reshuffle his team ahead of the June
12 match against South Africa in Marseille. Denmark and Saudi
Arabia complete Group C.
	   ``I know the starting 11, but it is not impossible to change,''
he said, highlighting how two preparation games in Morocco had
raised as many questions as solved them.
	   France is a favorite to make at least the tournament's final
four and Jacquet has been working hard on physical preparations
over the past week to get everyone in top shape.
	   He is also pondering changes to a starting lineup in midfield
and attack.
	   Even though Christian Karembeu was a European Champions Cup
winner with Real Madrid two weeks ago, he was one of the worst
players on the pitch then and has failed to improve much since.
	   His midfield place could be taken by Arsenal's Emmanuel Petit,
who has had a sterling season all through.
	   Up front, Jacquet has been gushing praise on Monaco's Thierry
Henry, who increasingly looks to make the starting lineup after he
was considered lucky to even make the final 22 just a few weeks
ago.
	   But playing Henry out on the right could upset the balance
between Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff at the heart of any French
attack.
	   Jacquet still has Saturday's match in Helsinki against Finland
to fine-tune his strategy and remove any lingering doubts.
	   ``That's exactly what the match is made for,'' he said.
	   It will also be a late test for Monaco striker David Trezeguet,
who has been troubled by a calf injury over the past week and was
unable to complete the Morocco tournament.
	   France won the King Hassan tournament by beating Belgium 1-0 and
drawing with the host nation 2-2.

	   MARKET Review KLOFFE's KLSE CI Futures traded to a high of 703.0
and a low of 590.0, a trading range of 113.0 index points for the
month of April. It opened at its high of 703.0 on the first day of
the month and swung downwards to 643.5 before recovering moderately
on 8 April. Similarly, the April futures continued to plummet as
investors were bearish on the futures market. However, this was
followed by a slight recovery to 600 level after reaching the 3
month low of 590.0 on 21 April. As depicted in the ``spot month
basis'' graph, the futures prices were mostly at discount zone for
the entire month with a gap as wide as 34 index points on 21 April.
At expiration, the April futures closed at 622.3 index points, a
discount of 3.67 index points to the cash index of 625.97 index
points.
	   Trading Volume  Open Interest Trading activity in April was
tremendous, breaking 8 new records.
	   Highest daily volume since inception of 7,509 contracts was
achieved whilst on 8 April the average daily volume turnover
increased to 4,228 contracts and total volume for April surpassed
80,000 level which totalled to 84,560 in 20 trading days. Highest
daily open interest of 27,394 was achieved on 27 April as market
participants slowly rolled over their position 3 days before the
April contract expired. This was followed by the highest month-end
open interest of 14,527 for the month of April. The highest
turnover value recorded this month amounted to RM5,259,836,640, the
highest figure since inception which recorded a Derivatives
Liquidity Ratio of 127.55% of the value of underlying index
component stocks, a huge jump from 71.13% recorded in March 1998.
	   Volatility As depicted in the ``Index and Futures Volatility''
graph, the 20-day moving average volatility for KLSE CI Futures
stabilised at the 30% level while the short term volatility for the
underlying Composite Index settled at the 20% band (annualised).
The cash and futures market movement stayed within a tight range of
600-650 level which caused the huge drop in volatility.

	   WITHOUT an e-mail address, you will lose your friends and
without a website you will lose your business, Cisco Systems stated
emphatically at a seminar held last week in Bangkok, which drew
more than 800 participants.
	   Even though the Internet has gained popularity in Thailand some
companies and organisations are still unaware of what it means to
their business.
	   San Francisco-based Cisco, the world's largest Internet network
maker, has decided to educate the market, in anticipation that more
people would use the system and thereby boost sales.
	   The company made its intentions clear at the beginning of the
seminar.
	   ''Many people have asked me what Cisco will get from holding
this free seminar. We are not selling anything to you. We want you
to use the Internet and we can sell to ISPs (Internet Service
Providers),'' Gene Deutsche, a Cisco lecturer on the Internet and
networking systems, said.
	   Internet webpages could become an important commercial tool by
helping to sell products and services. However, many entrepreneurs
and business executives are still hesitant to do business in
cyberspace.
	   A survey held last year by Forrester Research on why companies
use the Internet for commerce, found that 67 per cent said they
wanted to be technology leaders.
	   About 27 per cent said they used the Internet because their
buyers were on-line, while 13 per cent said they wanted to keep up
with the competition. Sixty-three companies interviewed.
	   In 1997, the average organisation generated 18 per cent of its
revenue through the Internet while the rest came from phone and
fax. However, by the year 2000, the Internet can expect to be
generating about 42 per cent of the total income.
	   ''More and more people are realising the need to get into the
Internet,'' Deutsche said.
	   The media is making an impact on all businesses. As more is
learned about globalisation, Thai firms cannot help but join the
Internet trend.
	   ''Think of it this way: now, people have e-mail addresses on
their business cards. What happens if you do not have one?
Companies want to know your products, the first place they will
check is the website, if you do not have one, you will lose
business,'' Deutsche said.
	   Even other communications firms, like telephone companies, have
not been able to avoid the impact of the Internet. Their way of
surviving is to be a part of the Internet, said Vorawat
Pattrayanond, managing director of Cisco Thailand.
	   ''More data will go through networks that once only served voice
communication. That's why telephone companies want to become an
Internet Service Provider,'' Vorawat said.
	   He cited the success of Amazon.com, the world's largest
bookstore with more than two million titles, as a reflection of
globalisation.
	   ''Our Duangkamol bookstores or any bookstores in Thailand are
facing competitors like Amazon.com who is doing business from
abroad through the Internet,'' Vorawat said.
	   He said Thai companies will have to look at expenditure on
information technology in a different way.
	   ''In the 1980s, expenditure on information technology facilities
was considered a waste. However, in the 1990s, it is regarded as a
productivity tool and from the year 2000 it will be a tool for
competitive advantage,'' Vorawat said.

	   NO doubt these are uncertain times, but anyone in the market for
new cars can hardly have it better: 1998 is shaping up to be a
bumper year for the introduction of new models in Malaysia.
	   Featured here are some of the more significant models headed our
way - barring hitches such as runaway home market demand resulting
in late production starts for Asian specifications, pricing
negotiations falling through between agents and their principals,
or changed market conditions taking a toll on launch intentions.
Others are models newly introduced in the country.
	   Certainly, those with Ringgit to spare this year will be spoilt
for choice.
	   ROLLS-ROYCE: The ultimate dream car NEXT Car Sdn Bhd, the
Rolls-Royce and Bentley distributor, hopes to sell six to eight
units of the Rolls Royce Silver Seraph(1), the latest model of
Rolls-Royce in 18 years, and only the ninth in the marque's 90-year
history. Replacing the Spur, the Silver Seraph was launched at the
Geneva Motor Show in March. It costs about RM3.4 million on the
road in Malaysia.
	   AUDI has class to spare AUDI variants in Malaysia, such as the
A4 and A6 models, take on both Mercedes and BMW in the medium-sized
executive market. The A6 2.6E V6(2), especially, has all the right
stuff. Select a smart colour combination and you'll have a car that
looks as classy as its more expensive rivals.
	   Following Audi's engineering tradition, the A6 2.6E V6 is
mounted longitudinally and drives the front wheels through a
tiptronic automatic transmission. Its engine is smooth and
sophisticated although, when compared to its rivals' powerplants,
is slightly rough-edged and hesitant in producing its power. Audi
models are distributed by Auto Dunia Sdn Bhd.
	   SSANGYONG sets the tone ALWAYS hankered for a new Mercedes Benz
but could not stump up for it?
	   Ssangyong(3) has come to your rescue by skilfully repackaging
the old Mercedes Benz W124 E-class platform and mechanicals and
turning it into their flagship model, the Chairman, with overt
styling cues that copy the German marque's large S-class. Already a
runaway success in South Korea, the Chairman could be a winner here
too if prices are kept in check.
	   Expect it around year-end, if domestic demand reach satisfactory
levels by then.
	   THE regal Range Rover BILLED as a `powerful off-road vehicle
with regal presence on or off the pavement,' the Range Rover(4)
shares its `Best of the Best' distinction with other accoutrements
of high living, such as Cartier jewellery and Rolex watches. `When
you specialise in four-wheel drives for 50 years as only Land Rover
has, winning honours year after year takes on added significance,'
says the president of Land Rover. `They reinforce a process of
steady refinement in the breed that keeps us at the front of the
pack.' Although staying ahead has been getting harder for Range
Rover with the arrival of rivals like the Mercedes-Benz ML430 and
Lexus LX 470, the Solihull flagship remains a strong seller in the
luxury SUV (support utilities vehicle) sector.
	   BMW mirrors perfection IF the economy recovers, BMW(5) lovers
will get to see the new 3 series in four-door format towards the
last quarter of the year. Larger, roomier and more refined than the
current model, the new sedan is expected to preserve the 3's nimble
handling in spite of its size.
	   In the meantime, BMW distributor Auto Bavaria Sdn Bhd is busy
promoting the latest in the 5 series, which many regard as the most
complete and well-sorted sport-luxury sedan range in the world. Be
it the entry-level 150bhp 5201 or the upcoming 400bhp 4.8 litre V8
M5 flagship, every 5 Series car feels like perfection, with
driveability, quality and desirability in equal portions.
	   RENAULT serene Safrane RENAULT'S(6) top-of-the-line model, the
Safrane, is an executive saloon you can depend on to take you home
in pampered comfort after a hard day at the office. Currently a
one-model range in Malaysia, the Safrane is in the same category as
the Audi A6, BMW 5-series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class in terms of
body size and equipment level.
	   While its competitors are sporty or stylish, the Safrane
dispenses a kind of serenity and provides a silky smooth
performance that's in a class of its own. Equipped with a 168-bhp,
2.5-litre, 20-valve, five-cylinder engine - the same unit used by
Volvo 850 - the Safrane is capable of 215kph, and a 0-100kph sprint
in under 10 seconds.
	   VOLKSWAGEN'S new Beetle THE new Volkswagen Beetle(7) is slated
to go on sale in Britain in early 1999. It shares its underpinnings
with the new Golf and has an identical wheelbase, although overall
length is down three inches. Cabin space doesn't match Golf
standards, owing in part to the Beetle's sloping rear roof line.
The boot, however, is a competitive two cubic feet. The original
Beetle's rear engine layout has been abandoned in favour of a more
conventional front engine and front wheel-drive design.
	   A choice of two engines will be available: the old Golf's 115bhp
eight valve 2.0 litre; and the current one's 90bhp TDi. There are
still no guarantees, however, that we will see this vehicle on
Malaysian soil.
	   RED-BLOODED coupe from Alfa Romeo ALFA Romeo's(8) front-drive
GTV and Spider models, introduced last year, are gorgeous. More
than that, they are true originals - they look like nothing else,
and with their multi-link rear suspension, handle superbly.
	   They have prodigious grip, ultra-sharp steering, and are brimful
with that old Alfa charisma. From the retro-chic of their deeply
cowled dials to the unmistakable rasp of their 150bhp 2.0 litre
Twin Spark engine, the GTV and Spider are real, red-blooded Alfas.
	   Alfa Romeo vehicles are distributed by Milan Auto (M) Sdn Bhd.

	   THE Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) will allow foreign
investors to invest in the Joint Development Area (JDA) gas
pipeline project worth more than US$1.2 billion in a bid to reduce
the huge investment burden.
	   Piti Yimprasert, president of PTT Gas, said PTT plans to seek
foreign partners for joint investment in the JDA gas pipeline
project, including JDA-Songkhla, JDA-Erawan II and the Rayong-Bang
Pakong pipeline installation. Since the investment is so large, PTT
needs support from strategic partners to proceed with the project.
	   Due to the budget deficit, the government has allowed state
enterprises to conduct construction under a build-own-transfer
system to reduce the investment from public sector.
	   PTT in late April signed a purchasing agreement for 640 million
cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) of natural gas from JDA operators to
be delivered to Thailand in late 2001-2002.
	   However, PTT will negotiate with Malaysian authorities to
postpone the natural gas delivery date from 2002 to a few years
later to keep the project in line with the economic situation, he
added.
	   ''We prefer to postpone gas delivery date by around two years to
wait for economic recovery. Besides, once the gas pipeline from
Burma to the country is installed, Burma will be able to supply
additional natural gas to Thailand.'' Conducting a joint investment
project worth more than Bt5 billion between private and public
sector requires approval by a special committee of representatives
from ten ministries based on State Enterprises Act. A public
hearing is also required. The joint investment approval procedure
takes around two years.
	   According to Piti, PTT will wholly invest in the Ratchaburi-Wang
Noi gas pipeline project, worth Bt12 billion, although PTT has been
suffering from a budget shortage. The contractor bidding is
expected to be completed by the end of this year to be in line with
gas supplied from the Yetagun gasfield in the year 2000.
	   ''The Ratchaburi-Wang Noi project is necessary so that the
country can secure an energy supply system since most of gas
pipelines are located in the Gulf of Thailand area.'' To proceed
with the project, PTT will cut the budget of some projects that do
not urgently need investment capital. Some portion of the budget
will be allocated from the sale of PTT Exploration  Production
Plc's shares and the investment budget of fiscal 1999, he added.
	   The Cabinet recently granted investment worth approximately
Bt1.5 billion to lay the pipeline of the Pailin and Benchamas gas
field projects to prepare for gas delivery in 1999.
	   According to studies by several oil companies on the natural gas
business, the natural gas sector has had the least impact from the
regional economic crisis. Although gas consumption in the
industrial sector this year has dropped by around 10 per cent, the
slack has been taken up by new customers in the power generation
business. The number of clients is expected to reach 137, as
against last year's 117.
	   Anon Sirisaengtaksin, senior vice president of PTT's natural gas
marketing  transmission, said natural gas demand is expected to
jump to 2,200 MMscf/d in 1999-2000, compared to 1,600 MMscf/d at
present. The rise will come from several power generation projects.
	   In addition, government policy to use natural gas in the South
Bangkok Power Plant and Bangpakong Power Plant, which have a
combined capacity of more than 3,000 megawatts, will help increase
gas consumption.

	   AFTER firming to a high of RM2209/MT due to the Ringgit
weakening to 3.8000 level, the market resumed a wary stance as
players awaited Indonesia's next step on its palm export ban.
	   A few Indonesian-linked companies then made a pre-emptive move
by selling the forward products market in anticipation of the
lifting of the export ban, causing the KLCE to correct downwards to
a low of RM2135/MT.
	   However, prices quickly recovered, as the supply situation in
Malaysia remained tight with South Physical Crude against KLCE
widening to RM50.
	   Despite a stronger Ringgit at about 3.6500, prices rallied to
above RM2200/MT.
	   Even with confirmation of Indonesia lifting the export ban by
April 22 and imposing a 40% and 35% export duty on CPO and RBD
Olein, respectively, prices corrected only slightly. A relatively
bearish end-March 98 Porla release with production at 598,612MT
(-0.44%, slightly above the trade estimate of -3%) and stocks at
623,989MT (-15.42%, above the trade estimate of 600,000MT), failed
to dampen sentiment. With producers reluctant to sell on one hand
and refineries desperate for crude on the other, prices rallied
further to the mid-RM2300/MT levels.
	   Near month's end, the bullish sentiment faltered as Indonesia
actually shipped out some palm cargo and prices dipped to RM2260/MT
levels.
	   However, the market proved resilient and charged back as crude
sellers remained scarce and as the Ringgit weakened to 3.7000
levels on further corporate failures.
	   At month's end, news of frequent riots in Indonesia diminished
hopes of a steady palm supply from that country, prompting massive
trade and speculative buying to test the RM2400/MT mark.
	   It appears that the fuse in Indonesia is lit again, as public
discontent about hyperinflation flares into widespread riots.
	   The primary assumption is that palm supply from Indonesia will
be unreliable and that supply from Malaysia will still be more
secure.
	   Besides, although palm stocks in Indonesia is said to be quite
high, estimated conservatively at 400,000MT and 700,000MT on the
high end, much of this supply is to fill previous deferred
shipments. Therefore, bearishness of the ban lifting appears to be
discounted.
	   The secondary reaction is that the Indonesian socio-political
unrest will again pressure the regional currency units. This will
translate into higher Ringgit denominated crude prices.
	   As such, the palm scenario continues to be supportive.
	   Production in Malaysia appears to be stabilising, estimated to
be unchanged to 2% higher at 600,000MT. Initial reports of heavy
declines early in the month has been tempered by better output in
the second half of the month. Output will likely improve
significantly from now onwards, but the long dry spell has
certainly `stressed the trees'. We will assume that peak production
in September/November will likely be curtailed and that the last
quarter output will decline very quickly. A similar model applies
to the Indonesian production pattern.
	   Comments from Oil World implies that the global edible oils
situation this year is pressing with contractions in palm oil
output in Malaysia and Indonesia and in the summer oilseeds crop in
India. Therefore, weather is paramount in the second half of the
year as India and the United States enter the oilseeds planting
window. Sentiment will certainly be edgy as a crop failure will be
catastrophic.
	   Palm demand appears to be stable with April 98 disappearance
estimated at 680,000MT. A few refineries experienced cargo
readiness problems in light of scarce crude supply resulting in
some shipments deferred into May. India has been the most
impressive buyer with 110,000MT of palm products in bulk. Pakistan
has maintained consumption at about 60,000MT while China, having
bought substantially in March, has reduced offtake at about
50,000MT. Due to the shortfall in India's summer crop, it will
continue to be a large buyer until the winter oilseeds harvest in
November.
	   From the above data, end-April stocks will be reduced to about
550,000MT. This tight situation will persist into June, as
production will barely meet demand in the next few months.
	   Traders maintain a buy approach towards the market especially if
the Ringgit strengthens back to about 3.6000 as they are not
particularly friendly towards the unit based on Chart Analysis.

	   THE Council of Economic Ministers Monday approved a measure to
help boost the income of farmers and alleviate the suffering of the
agricultural industry which has been hit by the baht depreciation.
	   With the measure's approval, the government has assigned the
Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives to provide loans
to farmers at the start of the harvest season to improve their
bargaining power.
	   The government will also strengthen the purchasing power of
local merchants and provide a mechanism for them to bargain with
exporters for better prices.
	   In addition, the Internal Trade Department must set up an
efficient information system for agricultural exporters, local
traders and farmers to reduce unfair conditions in the market
mechanism.
	   The Commerce Ministry, Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry and
the Bank of Thailand will prepare clear, basic information on
production, quantity, export prices and foreign exchange rates.
	   Government spokesman Somchai Sahachairungruang said the measures
proposed by the Commerce Ministry were based on important export
factors including production costs, exchange rates, interest rates,
world market prices and export prices, domestic prices, liquidity
and transportation, to provide a picture of market trends and the
country's competitiveness.
	   Somchai said demand for agricultural goods is lower than last
year as a result of the overall economic recession. Asia's
financial crisis is reducing purchasing power in the region, where
important export markets are located.
	   Prices are also declining due to lower demand. Export rice
prices, for example, have dropped by 16 per cent, and tapioca
prices plunged by 24 per cent compared to the same period last
year.
	   However, Thai agriculture exports are growing with high demand
from countries that faced droughts caused by the El Nino
phenomenon. Rice exports are expected to reach 6 million tonnes
this year.
	   Before July 2, agricultural prices depended on market demand and
supply. Afterwards, the market was most concerned about other
factors, such as exchange rates, which have an important impact on
market margins in the form of high risk-high returns. The
stabilisation of the baht from April to May will help return
trading and producing to the right direction as they were before
the flotation.
	   ''The baht hit its lowest at Bt56-57 against the US dollar in
January. Farmers gained higher export value but also faced higher
production costs and interest rates,'' Somchai said, adding that
losses have caused another important problem, forcing farmers out
of the market and reducing the country's output this year.

	   RIOTS and street demonstrations in Indonesia have spooked the
Singapore stockmarket, encouraging selling, keeping potential
buyers away, and dashing hopes of a quick rally.
	   The market, which collapsed in January as the Asian currency
crisis sent shockwaves through financial markets, had made a
comeback in March, with the benchmark Straits Times Industrial
Index (STII) peaking at 1,700 points. It was driven by a sense of
relief that the worst could be over for Southeast Asia, along with
a more stable regional currency situation and lower interest rates.
	   Cash-laden mutual funds, which had bailed out of the region's
stockmarkets on fears that the economic and political instability
in Indonesia could lead to a regional financial catastrophe,
started rebuilding their positions in Singapore when the worst-case
scenario did not materialise.
	   But the deteriorating situation in Indonesia appears to have
dimmed hopes of a sustained recovery and could sink the market,
possibly to the January level when the STII fell to 1,031 points.
	   Currently, hedge funds are selling while confidence remains
fragile. The market shows no sign of reversing the falls any time
soon; instead, a one- way bet is providing further incentive to
sell, with occasional bargain- hunting in selective stocks.
	   On May 7, the 30-share unweighted STII fell more than 3% to a
low of 1,399.61 in the wake of riots and police shootings that
wounded two demonstrators in Medan, a key commodities trading
centre of two million people. The city lies just a few hundred
kilometres northwest of Singapore.
	   The Indonesian unrest followed sharp rises in domestic fuel and
transport prices, which were part of the conditions for a US$40
billion economic rescue package by the International Monetary Fund.
	   In the short-term, the STII is expected to slide further as
investors fear the Indonesian riots could spread political
uncertainty to the rest of Southeast Asia and affect the confidence
in the region. As Indonesia's an important trading partner,
accounting for nearly 11% of exports, Singapore is vulnerable to
this contagion.
	   Further, the problems plaguing the Japanese economy are also
expected to undermine investors' confidence in the Singapore market
in the coming months. The Japanese economy, which has been
threatening to plunge headlong into a recession, could drag the Yen
even lower and send Southeast Asian currencies, the Singapore
dollar included, into another downward spiral.
	   On the domestic front, there are worries that the island is
starting to lose its reputation as a fortress against the regional
economic uncertainty and a haven for investors, following an
expected abrupt halt to its years of strong economic growth.
	   For the first three months of this year, Singapore's real gross
domestic growth (GDP) was an impressive 5.6%, while last year, the
economy grew by 7.8%, compared to the previous year. But with the
full impact of the regional financial turmoil yet to be felt and
the social and economic meltdown in Indonesia yet to settle down,
the economy is likely to slow down considerably in 1998 - possibly
even below the government's forecast of between 2.5% and 4.5%.
	   In addition, the Singapore dollar has lost considerable ground
to the US currency, while interbank rates have crept up to a
two-month high of 6.5% in early May, fuelling fears that local
banks might raise their prime rates from the current average of 7%.
	   There are also concerns over the Singapore banking sector, with
banking groups expected to make provisions similar to last year's
for their regional exposure to non-performing loans.
	   Companies' earnings growth is also expected to be flat this
year, making a mild recovery. Most Singapore companies are likely
to experience a prolonged period of economic malaise as the
business environment deteriorates.
	   In the short-term, the STII is likely to test the 1,200-point
level and could go down to 1,100 points before recovering as the
market consolidates and responds to the severe, long-term economic
effects of the region's financial crisis.
	   Volume, meanwhile, is expected to continue to be depressed as
many investors refrain from buying until there are definite signs
that the region is turning the corner, and this could exaggerate
any price movement.

	   NATIONAL Petrochemical Plc (NPC) has joined hands with leading
technology provider Asean Brown Boveri Ltd (ABB) to offer
maintenance and modification services to the industrial sector.
	   A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two companies
was signed late last month. The establishment of a joint venture
company will take place after a survey on customer bases.
	   Initially, factories in Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate,
particularly petroleum and petrochemical companies, will be
targeted before expanding to other areas.
	   With its reputation and expertise in maintenance service, ABB
will provide the technology while NPC will concentrate on supplying
manpower. NPC initiated the maintenance and modification service,
having postponed two joint venture projects due to the regional
economic crisis. The delayed projects include a $200 million
facility with Philipe Petroleum for an annual capacity of 200,000
tonnes of linear-low density polyethylene, and a 2EH/ normal
butadiene acrylonitrile project worth Bt3.25 billion with
Mitsubishi Corporation.

	   AFTER closing above the 700 level at the end of the first
quarter of this year, both the KLSE CI Futures and the underlying
KLSE CI fell 13.3% and 12.8% respectively on April 1, 1998.
	   A deep discount of between 20 to 27 points separated the April
Futures and the KLSE CI on aggressive selling of KLSE CI Futures by
large foreign institutions.
	   April Futures converged on April 30 1998 with the KLSE CI at the
settlement price of 622.30, passing the deep discount to May
Futures with May-April rolls traded to as wide as -24 points spread
(although the fair value was +5 points.) In general, like the other
regional bourses, the KLSE CI and the futures reacted to the
changes in local currencies. In April, Nikkei fell 621.78 points to
15,641.26 while Hang Seng was not much stronger, shedding off 10%
to 10,383.68. Therefore, KLSE CI's 12.8% fall was in tandem with
the weakness of the entire region.
	   Several negative developments in April worsened the situation.
The suspension of Maybank (the third largest market capitalisation
stock in the KLSE) on April 1, 1998 caused the spot month contract
to plunge from the month's high of 717.90 through the 700
psychological level to close near KLSE CI's April low of 616.04.
	   Maybank, which have a beta of 1.28 against the KLSE CI, lost RM3
in April, finishing near lows of RM11. Meanwhile, the largest
market capitalisation stock in KLSE, Telekom, slided from RM12.50
to RM11 on concerns of a possible bailout of Time Telekom.
	   The downtrend was aggravated by the suspension of Ekran and
Wembley at the beginning of the month and growing fears of more
public listed companies succumbing to the pressure of
receiverships.
	   Heavy selloffs by foreign fund managers, rumoured to be from the
US, pushed the futures to continue trading at deeper discounts of
20 to 27 points to the KLSE CI. With the KLSE probing into the
affairs of local brokerage houses, the bearish sentiments persisted
throughout the month.
	   Futures seemed to be the only sensible mean of trading the
market.
	   Rating agency Standard  Poor's downgrading of the Ringgit and
its estimate of a 20% default of Malaysian bank loans compounded
the negative sentiments, pushing the futures and index down
further.
	   The relisting of RHB and RHBCap did not help the weakened market
as RHB fell RM1.10 on the first day of relisting to RM4.10. All in
all, out of the 21 trading days in April, 14 days were marked with
black candles (close lower than when the market opens) on the
chart.
	   For next month, the general indicators seem to point towards the
Mayfutures trading at a discount of around 20 points on continued
bearish sentiments.On a daily chart for the KLSE CI, the 3 day and
7 day moving averages seem to have converged, signaling a breakout.
However, with sellers converging around the 635 level, the first
resistance seems strong.
	   All this is in line with the weak Ringgit which had trapped
itself in a triangular formation. The focus should therefore very
much be on the frail Yen and the Yen-German Mark crossplay. With
expectations of rising interest rates in Germany and the
Deutschemark emerging as the leading currency in the Europe forex
market, the general sentiment is to long the Deutschemark against
other currencies especially the US Dollar, Pound Sterling and Yen.
	   Regional currencies here will watch the play and react
accordingly.
	   Like the Yen, which is held strong by the Bank of Japan between
134.73 and 128.60, the Ringgit will also range between 3.79 and
3.64 with market rumours of Bank Negara intervening at 3.80 level.
	   Like in April, the foreign investors will be watching the
Ringgit and other regional currrencies for May's direction.
	   The downtrend seems set to continue. Any retracement may be
minor as fresh waves of selling will take place. The aggressiveness
in the short rolls (short May after closing long April positions)
is indicative of this.
	   As at the beginning of the month, the fair values for May and
June are 1.3 and 5.8 respectively. This is because large index
linked stocks like Telekom, are paying heavy dividends. Telekom is
paying a 12 sen dividend with the ex date being 7 May.
	   Given the above, technical rebounds are likely to be shortlived
and should be considered as opportunities to short the futures, at
least in the early part of the month. However, should a base be
formed once the Jan-Feb gap is covered, then some retracements in
the middle of the year seems likely.

EDS: UPDATES with recall worldwide, details
<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ The luxury automaker Porsche on
Tuesday recalled more than 9,500 Boxters worldwide for possible
defective casings around the ignition starter switches.
	   Porsche said most of the cars affected were 1997 models. The
two-seat roadster, introduced last year, was Porsche's first new
model in 19 years.
	   The defect could cause electrical components, such as the
windshield wipers, to malfunction. The automaker said the problem
is present in cars that will not return to position one, ignition
on, from position two, starter motor runs.
	   Porsche said it also will change the bearing bushings idler
levers in the tiptronic transmission of 2,692 of the recalled cars.
	   Porsche said owners were being informed in writing.

	   SHOULD you launch your new product on television? If you run a
small business nowadays, that's an easy decision. You don't. You
can't.
	   Instead of a straightforward assault on the consumer market with
a major campaign, you're better off deploying an ambush: use
promotion instead.
	   Promote by gimmick. Sell by giving things away.
	   Big companies have nationwide reach if they give something away;
you don't. But you have an advantage on them: you don't have a
staid image to protect, so you can be more wildly imaginative.
	   The essence of promotion is taking people unawares to get past
their natural scepticism, appealing directly to their emotions. You
can inspire people to yearn for your product if you believe you
were put on this planet to sell it - and only if you don't take
yourself too seriously.
	   1) Give away lots of samples. But besides being liberal with
them, be strategic: use celebrities. Track them down at the
restaurants they haunt (you can find this out easily in the
celebrity press). Be persistent. If Brooke Shields gets
photographed for a magazine playing with your toy, you're all set.
	   Be nervy. If you're marketing a rubber axe for Halloween, find
Jack Nicholson and make him a present of it.
	   Be imaginative. A friend of mine invented a `No Smoking' kit,
and wanted to get a picture of it in the hands of C. Everett Koop,
the US Surgeon General. He heard that a local school was auctioning
off lunch with Dr Koop as part of a fund-raising event. My friend
bought the lunch.
	   2) Give live demonstrations in public places. Choose carefully.
Try public plazas and tourist attractions where large crowds
gather. (Why not try for press coverage too?) 3) Create a zany
spokesman for your product. If you've got a new sneaker, try a
talking track shoe with eyes that light up. Or turn something into
your spokesman. I was impressed by a stunt I saw in New York: a
shoe company put shoes on the statue of Atlas in Rockefeller
Centre. It took six hours for security guards to get around to
removing them.
	   4) Make trade shows fun - most of them are so boring. Hire the
Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders to work your booth. A paper-shredder
manufacturer might convince Fawn Hall to demonstrate his wares; if
not, a good lookalike will do.
	   If you don't want to use showbiz glitz, there's still no need to
have someone just standing by your booth with an order pad saying,
`Hi, it's nice to meet you.' Have him standing on his head.
	   And don't make the mistake of having a good buffet. All too
often, people just come for the food and forget what you're about.
	   5) When you're sending samples to important people, never keep
them waiting. Use Express or a messenger; if your sample is to go
to another city, consider flying it there yourself.
	   Make your package fun, not just for the person you're trying to
impress, but for the whole office: have something in there for the
receptionist, the assistant, the secretary. Get them on your side.
When the big guy returns from lunch, your stunt will already have
worked. He'll find the receptionist and secretary playing with your
product, calling out to him, `Look what we got!' What should be in
your kit? Nothing the `big guy' has to assemble or inflate. You
inflate it and put in the batteries, and maybe he'll turn on the
switch. Better yet, send the product already running inside the
box. A groaning, scratching package will pique a little curiosity.
	   Remember, the point is to get lots of your product in people's
hands.
	   Richard Knerr and `Spud' Melvin, the inventors of the Hula-Hoop,
went around the San Fernando valley just giving Hoops away. Debbi
Fields ran up and down the streets giving out her cookies.
	   By giving something away, you will be getting something you
couldn't create with all the TV commercials in the world: people's
surprise and spontaneous enjoyment of your product. There is no
better advertising. -UPS

	   YOU wouldn't consider making an important sales call in a dirty
shirt and a pair of worn-out shoes. So why approach an investor
with a balance sheet that doesn't portray your company in the best
light?
	   A balance sheet is your best sales pitch for your business.
There's no document so thoroughly scrutinised by a financier or so
critical to his decision to lend you money. You'll have an easier
time convincing him if you present a compelling story.
	   A balance sheet is a snapshot of your company's financial health
at a particular time. The prettier the picture, the more you'll
reassure lenders you can repay them.
	   Your goal in structuring your balance sheet is to increase
assets and reduce liabilities. Every extra dollar in assets you
present without an offsetting liability drops to the bottom line as
owner's equity. That's an important source of collateral: each
bottom-line dollar can translate into US$5 to US$7 worth of credit.
	   To look your financial best, pay attention to how you list
information.
	   Start by identifying assets: everything the business owns or
leases that has exchange or market value. List assets in order of
their nearness to cash, or the ease with which they can be
liquidated.
	   Cash: It's king. When preparing for a round of money raising,
postpone as many spending decisions as possible.
	   Account Receivable: This is money owed to your business for
goods or services already delivered. But if an unpaid invoice is
more than 90 days old, write off or get the customer to sign a
promissory note, to convert the account to a ``note receivable.''
	   Notes Receivable: Document all of these IOUs to the business,
even informal loans to employees and family. One way to build this
category of assets and reduce operating expenses is to take a big
chunk of your salary out of the company as a note receivable. The
strategy may also save you income tax.
	   Inventory: It represents the value of your company's raw
materials, work in progress, and finished goods on hand. Check with
your CPA about the best methods of valuation.
	   Fixed Assets: These include all tangible properties such as
furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and machinery. If you must
buy fixed assets before shopping around for new capital, always go
for quality stuff so that it retains as much book value as
possible.
	   Deposits: Prepaid Expenses. Among these are real estate,
equipment, or vehicles that you personally own and lease to the
company. You can use them to create additional assets. If the
company pays you US$2,000 a month in rent, consider taking half
that and increasing the security deposit; at the end of a year,
you'll have a US$12,000 cash asset for the business that you can
use tax-free until you declare the deposit forfeit.
	   Other Assets: These include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and
royalty agreements, which should be reported if you're legally
entitled to them.
	   Don't neglect the debit half of the ledger. You job is to
minimise liabilities, which are claims on assets, or, at least, to
push the due dates as far away as possible.
	   Current Liabilities: These are debts, such as notes payable to
banks, coming due within a year or less. Try to convert them to
long-term liabilities to free up working capital.
	   Long-Term Liabilities: It pays to restructure long-term debt
(due more than a year away) either to take advantage of reduced
interest payments or to lengthen the payback period because it
improves your cash flow. Other ways to get long-term debt off the
books: assuming personal responsibility for it, especially if
you're already guaranteeing it; reporting parts of your salary or
bonus as equity in the company.
	   Check with your CPA to make sure all changes are in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Since you're using
the balance sheet to sell yourself and your company to the
financial community, be certain the statement conforms to what you
really are, while accentuating your good points.
	   Get started now. Your capital needs may be six months or a year
away, but it's never too early to restructure your balance sheet. -

	   AS at Dec 31, 1997 the Securities Commission (SC) recorded a
surplus of RM178.4 million. Total Income for the year - RM252.85
million -comprised levies RM190.89 million, interest on deposits
RM40.19 million, fees and charges RM19.94 million, and other income
RM1.83 million. Set against this was Expenditure of RM74.48
million, which included the following items: personnel RM29.18
million, administration RM14.08 million, premises RM5.41 million,
depreciation RM6.83 million and grants RM19 million.
	   The SC's three-phased plan to move from merit-based regulation
to a disclosure-based system spans more than five years. The second
phase that was to have started this year is now expected in 1999.
	   During financial year 1997, the SC promulgated several policies
and amended certain Guidelines. The major ones include Guidelines
for the Public Offering of Securities of Foreign-based Companies
with Listing and Quotations on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE), which was issued in April 1997. Revisions to Guidelines on
Unit Trust Funds was issued in May.
	   Updates and revisions to the Policies and Guidelines on
Issue/Offer of Securities were issued in July. September saw the
issue of Two New Practice Notes - Practice 16 and 17, and
Guidelines Governing Purchase of Own Shares by Listed Companies.
Procedures for applying for exemption from making a mandatory
general offer, were announced in December.
	   The number of corporate proposals submitted for approval by the
SC increased in 1997. A total of 379 submissions were received from
public companies, a 14.8% increase over 1996, of which 318 were
considered and 267 approved. The 318 proposals included 149
flotation submissions, of which 106 were approved. Twenty-six were
approved for listing on the Main Board and 80 on the Second Board.
	   There was a 24% decline in the number of proposals relating to
bonus, rights and special issues submitted to the SC, from 38 in
1995 to 29 last year. Debt securities submissions increased by 44%,
from 27 in 1996 to 39% in 1997. There were no submissions for call
warrants during the year.
	   For 1997, a total of 210 issues was expected to raise about
RM50.3 billion (in 1996, 173 issues raised RM16.8 billion).
Component issues approved to be undertaken by listed and unlisted
companies in 1997 included 106 Initial Public Offerings raising
RM15.8 billion; 40 Rights Issues raising RM14.6 billion; 17 Special
Issues raising RM2.2 billion; four ICULS raising RM968.6 million
and 43 Debt Securities raising RM16.7 billion.
	   In 1997, the SC also received 153 applications pertaining to
various requirements of the Take-Overs Code (in 1996, there were
154 applications). The number of applications involving the making
of general offers decreased from 89 the previous year to 66 in
1997. There was a significant increase of 33.8% in the number of
applications not involving the making of general offers, from 65 in
1996 to 87 in 1997.
	   As for supervision of the market, the SC conducted a full scope
examination of one stockbroker and a limited scope examination of
another for call warrants. Four others were examined by the KLSE
subject to supervision and full review by the SC. The SC invoked
Section 52(1) of the Securities Industry Act 1983 by appointing
Independent Auditors to perform full scope audits on three
stockbrokers due to adverse liquidity and financial positions.
	   In 1997, the SC and market institutions continued to work
together to ensure compliance in the market. Audit reports of
exchanges among their members were submitted to the SC and
reviewed. The KLSE conducted management audits of 40 stockbrokers
and updated the status of the 20 stockbrokers examined in 1996, in
compliance with the government's broad policy on active Bumiputera
participation in the stockbroking industry.
	   Apart from this special audit, the SC also received 38 audit
reports from KLSE for review. There were 11 audit reports from
KLOFFE, eight from MME, seven from KLCE and 13 from the MDCH
submitted for SC review.
	   A total of 69 cases were investigated under various sections of
the Act.
	   While the majority of investigations involved short-selling (51
cases), the SC also conducted investigations on, among others,
insider trading, market manipulation and false or misleading
statements. Some 119 new complaints were lodged with the SC in
1997; the SC also had to deal with 40 complaints brought forward
from 1996. The SC managed to close the file on about 19% of the
cases.
	   The SC's market supervision function was enhanced with the
signing of memoranda of understanding (MoU) with the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, Capital Markets Authority of
Kenya, Financial Services Board of South Africa, Securities and
Futures Commission of Taiwan, and Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios
of Brazil. The MoUs provide a framework for mutual assistance and
information sharing. Efforts in this direction were facilitated by
Section 438 of the Securities Commission Act, which allows the SC
to provide assistance to any foreign securities supervisory
authority.

	   MOODY's Investors Services downgrading of Japan's sovereign debt
outlook to negative earlier last month incurred the wrath of
Japanese economists.
	   This was because this rating essentially implied that Japan is
faced with a high risk of default in its debt repayments.
	   They argued that this was ironic, considering the country's
hefty trade surplus and strong foreign reserves. The gloomy report
rocked the country's markets, dragging down the Yen to a record
seven-year low against the US Dollar.
	   In fact, one analyst went to the extent of saying that
comparatively, it is the United States which should receive a
negative rating, based on the February figures. It recorded the
biggest deficit in six years - the goods and services deficit
increased 4.2% to US$12.1 billion (RM46 billion) from a revised
US$11.6 billion in January.
	   This threatens to offset the favourable effects brought upon by
the super power's contracting budget deficit.
	   The downrating also baffled economists because Japan's ability
to repay its external debt is strong due to its high reserves
holdings, especially in the form of US Treasury bonds.
	   This episode added insult to injury at a time when rating
agencies the world over were rigorously trying to redeem themselves
from the massive criticisms received for failing to predict the
Asian currency turmoil and subsequent economic downturn.
	   And this was despite the presence of strong signals like high
asset inflation, burgeoning current account deficits and poor
management of the banking and financial system in some of these
countries.
	   The failure of rating agencies to detect these weaknesses to
accurately forecast the health of Asian economies and companies has
become the butt of jokes.
	   In fact, at the height of the Asian currency meltdown last year,
some industry observers had even jokingly implied that an
independent watchdog needed to be set up to start rating these
agencies! Jokes and implied inefficency aside, their influence has
hardly waned, if Moody's forecast for Japan is anything to go by.
In fact, the Far Eastern Economic Review's weekly Asian Executive
Poll recently showed 69% of top company executives interviewed said
they trusted international rating agencies more than Asian ones.
	   At the same time, approximately 58% of the business leaders
polled said international rating agencies like Moody's and Standard
 Poor's have not been too harsh on Asian countries and companies.
	   However, in Malaysia, 53.3% of business executives interviewed
said these agencies were too harsh in their ratings, while only
17.2% said they would rather trust Asian rating agencies than
Moody's or SP.
	   Moody's recent downgrading of Japan's debt outlook has prompted
some people - the Japanese at least - to seriously consider
evaluating rating agencies. The Japan Centre of International
Finance, a group backed by private financial firms, will assess
rating validity and credibility of eight agencies, including
Moody's and SP.
	   This is because a downgrading by either one of world's two most
influential rating agencies - the US-based Moody's and SP - can
seriously affect a company's and even country's ability to raise
funds.
	   However, rating agencies contend that they are not the bad hats
they have been made out to be. As Suresh Menon, general manager of
Rating Agency of Malaysia (RAM), puts it, `The criticism that
rating agencies have been slow in responding to the Asian financial
crisis is correct but it was not due to their negligence.' He said
rating agencies based their forecasts on information received.
	   `Rating agencies are no magicians. We can't gaze into the
crystal ball and predict what is going to happen.
	   `You also cannot fault a rating for a surefire yes or no. If a
bad rating is given, we are simply saying that the company has a
high tendency to default. However, it does not necessarily mean it
will default.
	   Timeliness and the quality of the information available are
important elements to foresee what is going on.' Menon's views
echoed those of his superior, Datuk C Rajandram, chief executive
officer (CEO) of RAM and Vincent J Truglia, managing director of
Moody's.
	   The right information is indeed vital to credit raters. They
both agree that transparency and full public disclosure is the key
to accurate forecasts. Truglia said in a recent report that
although a rating may be accurate, it might yield different results
due to the different methodologies used. Therefore, he added, `the
facts themselves must be known as well.' Comparing ratings between
various agencies are like comparing apples and oranges. However, as
long as investors understand the distinction between the various
rating methods utilised by different agencies, Truglia believes no
real harm is done.
	   Rajandram believed rating agencies are doing their best to
disseminate vital and timely information to the public but the
delay in receiving the much needed information leads to a setback
in disclosing their opinions.
	   `So, we need to re-examine the transparency requirements so that
we will be better informed,' he said recently.
	   Menon thinks the lack of transparency and information lags on
aggregate private sector debts caused rating agencies to ignore
signals of a potential downturn.
	   Referring to the current economic slowdown, he says, `Nobody,
not even international agencies like the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which possess greater and more
timely access to such information, had anticipated the cumulative
effects of the situation until the bubble burst.' This is because
compared with the Mexican and Latin American crises which were
associated with government excesses, the Asian problems stem
largely from the private sector and were therefore more difficult
to detect.
	   `Getting information from governments for the Asian kind of
problem is very difficult for rating agencies. So, our opinions are
derived from the information given by various ministry officials,'
Menon explained.
	   On hindsight, it took until late December last year for Moody's,
SP and Fitch-IBCA to tell that South Korea was in danger of
default. By that time, the Won had lost 55% of its value against
the US Dollar and yields on its Eurobonds had risen by at least 5%
points.
	   These agencies have also said that their delayed forecast was
due to them not receiving information as fast as they needed it.
So, investors will have to rely on past rating reports and conduct
their own research.
	   In the case of Malaysia, why did local rating agencies let
impending problems go undetected despite signals like the widening
current account deficit and the rapid credit growth compared with
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth?
	   Menon says, `We don't do sovereign risk analysis. Our analysis
is more on micro-level, that is on a company by company basis.
Still we have warned about the asset inflation for the property
market. Our reports from the very beginning show that there has
been asset inflation and there has been an oversupply in the hotel
sector. We have highlighted the dangers of overlending in the stock
broking sector. We have been incorporating these warnings in our
ratings.' Nevertheless, he admits that the local rating agencies
did not anticipate a swift downturn. `We were expecting more of a
soft landing. I must admit we did not foresee the degree of the
current downturn, although we have been factoring these potential
dangers in the ratings.' In the final analysis, rating agencies can
learn some lessons from this entire episode.
	   For one, contagion effects due to the increasingly integrated
regional and global economy are becoming an important source of
financial market instability and risks.
	   The severity of these effects varies from country to country.
Therefore, rating agencies must develop the ability to
differentiate individual countries' strengths and weaknesses.
	   `It shows you the importance of having analysts on the ground to
get a real feel of the respective country. That is something
foreign rating agencies should take note of. One way of doing this
is for international rating agencies to tie up with local ones,'
Menon points out.
	   RAM's partner, Duff  Phelps, besides tying up with RAM, has
recently forged an alliance with a Korean rating agency. `So, they
will now feel the pulse of the Korean economy more profoundly since
their local Korean partners know the market and economy there.'
Menon said this was especially important in the era of shrinking
borders where it was vital to have people who really understood
what was going on in each country. This was because each country
had its own characteristics.
	   In micro-economic term, especially in Malaysian
domestic-oriented debts, the mismatch of funding tenure and
requirements of companies will lead them to fall into the trap more
quickly.
	   `Companies that use predominantly short term debt to finance
long term projects are the ones who are more likely to be in
trouble. It is a classic case of a mismatch of funding requirements
but this has been happening because of the liquidity available. But
in the current times of tight liquidity, companies relying on that
kind of funding will be the first ones to be likely hit in a rising
interest rates scenario,' says Menon.
	   Another valuable lesson is for credit rating analysts in
Malaysia to realign their thinking because a crisis like this
provides the best avenue to learn.
	   `Our analysts in RAM are basically a young group. Besides the
few of us, nobody else has gone through a recession since our
inception in 1991. Now they are faced with a situation of liquidity
crunch, interest rates hikes and an exchange rate depreciation,
things they have not experienced before,' he states.
	   This is the best time to learn and take stock of the situation
to rectify their thinking for the future, he concludes.

	   THE Securities and Exchange Commission's Board of Directors
Monday agreed to stir investment in the Thai Trust Fund scheme by
offering more investment channels to investors.
	   Additional channels would help motivate foreigners to buy more
shares of the listed company through the Thai Trust Fund, the SEC
said.
	   After its fourth meeting this year, the SEC's board allowed more
alternatives over Thai Trust Fund via the purchase of listed
company's capital increase shares in the primary market. Investors
can now buy capital increase shares of listed companies offered via
private placement or public offering.
	   Moreover, in case of investment in the secondary market, the SEC
allows the orders for big lots of shares and the lots can be
swapped to other kinds of securities. Earlier, the SEC allowed the
purchase of big lots only for transaction of similar investment
units.
	   According to Krongkaew Piemduoytham, managing director of the
Thai Trust Fund, currently only four listed companies have joined
the Thai Trust Fund programme. And among the four companies, Alucon
Plc is the only company which has been quite active. However, with
the new investment criteria, more property companies were likely to
join the programme because it would allow capital increase shares
to be traded in the primary market.
	   The SEC also agreed in principle on the issuance of the share
offer under the greenshoe option in which the transaction would now
be allowed to be more than 15 per cent of the total new shares.
	   The SEC agreed to adjust the calculation of the over-allotment
shares from not more than 15 per cent of total new issuance shares
to more than 15 per cent of the total shares offering.
	   Concerning the closed finance companies which were the members
of the Bangkok Securities Dealing Centre (BSDC), the SEC said the
companies would not be allowed to vote for the BSDC's directors.
They would also not be allowed to vote for the extraordinary
meeting of the Centre or join the Centre's membership meeting, or
receive any services which is provided by the BSDC.
	   The SEC added that any of their rights or responsibilities would
no longer be effective, although this would be with the approval of
the BSDC's directors as well as that of the SEC.

	   IN the burgeoning local unit trust industry with more than 80
approved funds at present, product innovations have become
imperative for survival and growth. In this respect Commerce-BT
Lifetime Trust stands out from the crowd.
	   The reason: Commerce BT is the first unit trust company in
Malaysia to gain approval to launch three funds simultaneously,
under one umbrella trust deed and one prospectus. `Three funds for
three different life stages,' enthuses Jason Yetton, chief
executive officer of Commerce-BT Unit Trust Management, the company
offering this innovative package.
	   The three funds - Future Goals Fund, Balanced Returns Fund and
Income Plus Fund - are specifically designed to meet investors'
differing needs for risk and return, and income, as versus capital
growth. Each fund has a maximum size of 500 million units, being
offered at RM0.50 apiece.
	   Commerce-BT combines the local expertise of one of Malaysia's
premier banking groups - the Commerce Asset-Holding Group - with
the international know-how of one of the world's largest fund
management companies - Bankers Trust Group. Bankers Trust has a
network spanning over 50 countries with more than RM1 trillion in
total funds under its management, as at end December 1997. It is
also the largest international investor in Asia and in 1997, ranked
as the best performing fund manager in the world.
	   Lifetime Trust, says Yetton, took 12 months to develop. `When
Commerce Asset and Bankers Trust decided to extend our successful
partnership to the unit trust industry, it was clear that we needed
to do something different if Commerce-BT was going to be
successful,' he contends. `After all there are more than 80 unit
trust funds available in Malaysia.' Its novelty lies in the
flexibility it provides investors to switch among the three funds
up to twice in any year to suit their investment goals. Says
Yetton, `Some investors would want to change due to investment
objectives or market conditions and we oblige, free of charge.'
Each fund has a different asset exposure. The Future Goals Fund is
targeted at maximising capital growth over the long-term through
investment in Malaysian shares. `It is suitable for aggressive
investors seeking potentially high investment returns. Of course
this also involves high risk and, therefore, investors must be able
to accept that investment returns will fluctuate significantly over
the short term,' says Yetton.
	   The Balanced Returns Fund aims to grow the value of your
investment over the long term through investment in a diversified
portfolio of Malaysian shares and fixed interest securities. `It
can invest up to a maximum 70% in the stock market and will pay an
income distribution to investors each year in January.' The Income
Plus Fund, for its part, is tailored to the more conservative
investor. It will provide an income distribution every six months
along with some capital growth over the medium term to offset the
effects of inflation. `The Income Plus Fund will predominantly
invest in fixed interest securities with a maximum 40% invested in
shares at any one time.' Yetton says the Lifetime Trust is mainly
targeted at retail investors.
	   The minimum investment in each fund is RM2,000. Alternatively
investors can start with as little as RM1,000 and then invest RM100
or more each month using the easy Investment Plan. Corporations
have shown keen interest in this investment. `We are talking to a
few corporates but so far we have not concluded any deals,' says
Yetton. `We hope to achieve the RM500 million maximum within three
to five years. But I think if we can achieve a size of RM200
million across all three funds within the first year, that will be
good enough in this economic environment.' Was the launch timely?
The stock market is riding low and the majority of unit trusts have
lost half their value. Yetton believes the current gloom provides
seasoned investors with a once-in-a-decade opportunity to invest
selectively in fine undervalued stocks. `We are launching at a time
when many companies are trading at valuations below their net asset
values and which are the lowest in the past five to seven years.'
This makes it the best time for investment provided investors are
prepared to take a three-to five-year view. `Historically, markets
often rebound quite strongly after a severe downturn and we believe
that there is a significant up-side for people who are prepared to
take a three- to five- year view to investment.' Lifetime Trust is
managed by Commerce Asset Fund Managers Sdn Bhd (CAFM) - another
joint venture between Commerce Asset-Holding and Bankers Trust -
which has earned an enviable reputation over the last seven years.
As at December 31 1997, it was handling more than RM303 million in
funds. In the recent Watson Wyatt 1997 Annual Report of asset
managers in Malaysia, CAFM was ranked top for 1996 and 1997.
	   CAFM's investment strategy combines a top down macroeconomic
analysis with bottom up on-the ground stock research. Currently,
Yetton says, the approach is cautious towards the stock market as
banks' non-performing loans have been rising and the property
sector has yet to hit rock-bottom.
	   `The thrust is stock-picking. We are looking at individual
stocks that have potential to be winners.'

	   DESPITE improved sentiments in the country's economy,
alleviation of the debt problem remains a key factor in true
economic recovery, SG Asian Research's quarterly economic review
said.
	   ''Thailand is still in the critical zone but is moving out of
it. It is too early to say if it has already left the danger
zone,'' the research institute's report said.
	   The report added that the government should help lower the
private sector's debts to stop the economy from collapsing even
further. Ideally, it should be done without the use of public money
and the state should act as a facilitator in the process of
bringing the creditors and debtors together.
	   The strategy would encourage foreign banks to roll over
short-term debts and to reach individual settlements with debtors.
However, there are signs that this process could have problems.
	   According to the report, the roll-over rate of 85 per cent is
actually dropping. With an estimated US$4 billion due each month, a
15-per cent maturity rate puts tremendous pressure on the balance
of payments. The maturity structure for roll-overs is very short,
only extended from one to three months, because head offices are
keen to keep their options open. Moreover, Japanese banks, by far
the largest single creditor group, are facing a difficult situation
at home with widening premiums reducing roll-overs.
	   The report added that the policy of encouraging debt roll-overs
was just a short-term palliative and did nothing to solve the
long-term problem. However, there still seems to be a reluctance in
providing any official support for debt restructuring along the
lines of Indonesia and Korea, as they fear it would confirm how bad
the situation really is. This also highlights the need for the
framework to be supported by the international community.
	   The report said the key would be to promote a market-based
solution when practical, without worrying about ethical issues,
because of the urgency of the situation. Both creditor banks and
shareholders would have to bear the losses.
	   The longer uncoordinated debt-restructuring talks between
creditors and debtors drag on, the longer it will take for normal
international financing flows to resume, the research institution
said.
	   ''Our fear is that until this happens, the baht will not
stabilise and the corporate sector will continue to face this
overhang,'' the report said.
	   The worst outcome would be an unmanaged debt moratorium, which
would have negative implications for long-term financing -- a major
problem in Thailand given the high dependency of the corporate
sector on bank financing. The odds on this are still uncomfortably
high and must offset the positives outlined above. Until this type
of framework is put in place, the baht will remain vulnerable to
negative sentiment, and SG Asi keeps its year-end forecast of
Bt45/US dollar, given that sentiment is still fragile and could
turn negative if debt restructuring progress is not forthcoming,
the report said.
	   According to SG Asia, the other big concern is that the strong
support for the present policies may lead to some policy slippages,
as the pressure to reform is lessened. Examples include backsliding
on the liberalisation of real estate restrictions placed on
foreigners.
	   The Chavalit administration had proposed some important reforms
to allow greater access but these appear to have been dropped. This
is a major concern because it means that the massive property
oversupply situation will take much longer to resolve as only
foreigners have the ready funds available to buy property. The
consequence is that the banking system problems (which are related
to overvalued property prices) will be more difficult to resolve.
	   Moreover, reforming the Alien Business Law appears to have been
put on hold. There are difficulties in the details as to how
exactly the Asset Management Corporation (AMC) and the Financial
Sector Restructuring Authority process works and grey areas in the
prevention of abuses. Although the AMC is being recapitalised to
Bt10 billion from Bt1 billion, this is unlikely to be enough to buy
the bad assets of the closed finance companies.
	   Also, funding for the Financial Institutions Development Fund's
large losses, which represent a large monetary and, thus,
inflationary overhang, is still unresolved as the proposed
international bond issues are small in relation to the bail-out
sums involved which amount to almost $30 billion.

	   THREE influent private organisations Monday agreed to conduct a
joint study on the new labour law, coming into effect on Aug 19,
1998, in an attempt to suggest changes to the amended law to
Premier Chuan Leekpai this week.
	   The new law has become a problem for both employers and workers.
Earlier, the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) said the
government should allow a grace period after the implementation of
the new law, given the country's economic crisis.
	   Khemadhat Sukondhasingha, FTI secretary-general, said that the
government should revise the law to make it more practical as the
private sector is not able to meet the new conditions.
	   Thavatchai Yongkittikul, secretary-general of Thai Bankers'
Assocition (TBA), will head the working group responsible for
drafting the proposal for consideration by the government. However,
any solution must be acceptable to both employers and workers.
	   Small and medium-sized industries have been struggling to stay
afloat and rushing to lay-off workers before the law becomes
effective. The move has contributed to a further rise in
unemployment.
	   Khemadhat said several conditions in the law could deter
investments, such as the compulsory measure that a company must
take responsibility for its subcontractor's workers in the event of
a collapse or closure and that workers should not be forced to work
for more than eight hours with the exception of certain
professions.
	   Moreover, the new law will narrow chances for female workers as
employers are expected to avoid hiring women due to tougher
conditions such as the prohibition of a pregnant employee working
up to 10 pm.
	   ''The FTI, TBA and Board of Trade of Thailand do not object
strongly to the new law, they simply think that it is inappropriate
under the present circumstances,'' said Khemadhat.
	   In addition, the private sector consultative committee will hold
a seminar on private debt restructuring between May 8 and 10. The
conclusion of the seminar will be proposed to the central bank as
input for setting the official criteria. An announcement on the
issue is scheduled for June 15.
	   The committee also urged the government to waive corporate tax
on private company revenues generated through debt restructuring,
such as purchasing assets for debt payment.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-artham previously agreed in
principle with the private sector's request and ordered the Revenue
Department to make the necessary revisions.

	   CAR sales in the region are plummeting as disposable income
shrinks, and once obliging banks and finance companies have stopped
offering easy money for that prestige marque. Those who already own
a vehicle are holding on to it - that is, if it has not already
been repossessed because of payment defaults.
	   But it is not just individual dreams of automotive luxury that
are being shattered, as currencies crash throughout the region and
economies sink with them. The auto industry has also stalled, while
growth through exports - the key to development for many of the
region's industries -seems questionable at best, even with devalued
currencies to help sales abroad.
	   Hardest hit has been Thailand which became a regional auto hub
for both parts production and car assembly in the booming 1980s and
early 1990s as manufacturers from Japan, Europe and the United
States realised the potential of Asia's markets.
	   Tens of thousands of auto workers are now jobless in an industry
once seen as vital to industrial growth. The manufacturers - mainly
Japanese -which once targeted the middle-class Thai market have
turned their focus to exports and introducing smaller, cheaper
vehicles, prompted by the crumbling purchasing power, the baht
devaluation and Thailand's banking crisis. As a result, exports
soared 201.06% last year with 42,218 units shipped, while value
jumped by 281.9% to 16.2 billion baht (RM1.14 billion). Other
numbers, however, are grim. Production dropped 35.6% to 360,303
units in 1997 from 559,428 units a year earlier, while domestic car
sales slumped 38.4% in 1997 to 363,156 units, from 589,126 units
the previous year.
	   The future looks `hopeless', says an analyst, who points out
that since the middle of last year, banks, finance houses and
leasing companies have imposed more stringent requirements for car
loans. These include down payments of as much as 50%, compared with
10% previously; double-digit interest rates; and reduced payment
terms, generally from five years to three.
	   The desperation encountered in Thailand is also felt in Malaysia
and Indonesia, the other two main car producing nations in the
region. The future holds little promise for Indonesia, where the
deal between Bimantara, which is controlled by one of President
Suharto's sons, and South Korea's Hyundai to build cars in
Indonesia has been suspended. The deal between Kia, the South
Korean brand rescued by its government last October, and
Indonesia's Timor, which is controlled by another presidential son,
looks even less secure.
	   Kia had undertaken to supply cars and technology to Timor,
Indonesia's national car company, which was to have enjoyed massive
tax and tariff advantages over rival marques. But following
Jakarta's agreement with the International Monetary Fund, those
privileges have been rescinded. The Timor car, priced at only Rp18
million (slightly less than RM7,000), went on sale last October and
to date, only 20,000 units have moved - many of them forced on
government agencies and private operations. Another 23,000 are
languishing in a compound near the Jakarta docks awaiting owners
willing to drive them away.
	   At present, 36,000 workers or about 60% of the industry's
workforce, have been sent home on indefinite leave, while prices of
mostly imported spare parts have risen in rupiah terms by 90-100%
since the beginning of last year. Car sales are expected to drop by
half this year, from more than 380,000 units sold last year, as a
result of rising prices, estimated at 30%, and a credit squeeze.
	   Astra International, Indonesia's largest vehicle assembler that
once boasted of not being able to make enough to meet demand, is
finding it difficult to score with its top-selling Toyota Kijang,
despite a larger engine and a more streamlined look.
	   Malaysia's carmakers, likewise, have not found the going easy.
Domestic demand has collapsed with sales dropping to 70% in the
first quarter, compared to a year ago. Proton, the largest of the
national brands, and Perodua, its more recent counterpart, have
scaled back in the face of the depressed home market, and the lack
of extensive export markets.
	   The financial turmoil sweeping through the region is also
causing massive pain to car manufacturers in Japan, Asia's biggest
carmaker, that has enjoyed strong returns from the region since the
early 1960s. Coming just months after a drop in domestic sales
because of higher local sales tax, it caused heavy losses as
investments in the region crumbled.
	   Of the big carmakers, only top-ranking Toyota, and Honda have
bucked the trend, earning record profits. The others - Mitsubishi
Motors, Nissan and Mazda - are on their knees. Nissan, say
analysts, may have scraped a profit, but it has been in trouble for
years. Both Mazda and Mitsubishi incurred heavy losses and are now
burdened with huge debts.
	   New vehicle registrations in Japan fell 3.8% to 4.49 million
units last year, while for this year, analysts expect a further
1.5% drop to 4.43 million units. There is also likely to be a
decline in royalty payments and revenues for technology transfers
from the new carmakers that the Japanese have nurtured in the
region, such as Malaysia's Proton that has grown because of
Mitsubishi.
	   Massive retrenchment has taken place as car markers were forced
to curb production and investment in anticipation of leaner times
ahead. Toyota, Nissan and Honda have also budgeted for lower direct
exports to Southeast Asia and reduced sales by the joint ventures
they dominate in the region.
	   Car exports from Japan to the region during the first quarter
crashed by 43.7% with exports to Indonesia and Thailand, the two
worst hit countries, plunging 95% to 254 units and 92.5% to 600
units respectively.

German police-record error hindered child murder investigation 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNE THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Police admitted Tuesday to
record-keeping mistakes that allowed a convicted rapist to avoid
detection early in the investigation into the rape and murder of an
11-year-old girl.
	   The killing of Christina Nytsch gained international publicity
after police resorted to the extraordinary measure of taking saliva
samples from 16,400 men for DNA testing _ the largest mass genetic
test to date.
	   Weeks of lab tests produced a suspect: Ronny Rieken, saliva
sample No. 3,889, was arrested Friday and confessed to raping and
killing Christina after his DNA linked him to the crime scene.
	   The 30-year-old mechanic had been imprisoned for three years
until 1993 for rape. But Rieken's record was not in Lower Saxony
state files that could have aided police in the investigation and
made the saliva test unnecessary.
	   ``There is absolutely no information in his files of his
previous conviction,'' Detlef Ehrike, police spokesman for the
northeastern state told NDR 1 Radio Niedersachsen on Tuesday.
	   Ehrike blamed police in Oldenburg for faulty record keeping.
They arrested Rieken for rape in 1989, but files mentioned only his
convictions for theft and house-breaking.
	   Oldenburg police were investigating how the error happened, a
local official, Herma Heyten, said Tuesday.
	   A series of highly publicized sex crimes against children in
recent years has galvanized efforts to improve crime records and to
make it easier for police to cooperate.
	   Christina's murder _ and the saliva testing that nabbed a
suspect _ intensified a push by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther
to start a national database of DNA from convicted sex criminals.
The lower house of parliament is expected to pass a law approving
it before summer break.
	   Database information could be compared to biological evidence
found at crime scenes, such as saliva, semen, blood, or tissue.
Police in Germany's 16 states could cross-reference data, a tactic
already used in Austria, Britain, the Netherlands and the United
States.
	   The interior minister said Monday that Christina's killing
proved the need for a database as a tool for solving and preventing
crimes.
	   If a database had existed, he suggested, the confessed killer's
DNA would have been on record because of his previous crime, making
it easier to catch him and discouraging him from striking again.
	   Christina disappeared March 16. Her body was found five days
later in woods near her home in Struecklingen, a village of about
3,500 people near the Dutch border.
	   Soon after, police in the nearby city of Cloppenburg asked the
18,000 men ages 18-30 in the region to have their saliva tested.
Voluntary DNA testing has worked in small communities where peer
pressure drove everyone to participate _ including the killer.
	   Despite the large size of this test sample _ 16,400 men
volunteered _ the technique apparently worked. Rieken confessed not
only to Christina's murder but also to the unsolved 1996 rape of
another 11-year-old girl.
	   He has been charged with murder and sexual abuse.

	   FINANCIER Tan Sri Rashid Hussain pulled off a major banking coup
in a complex deal which will salvage financially-troubled Sime Bank
and see RHB Bank emerging as the country's second-largest financial
institution.
	   Sime Bank's saviour is Phileo Allied Bhd, which will provide RM1
billion to partly finance the deal. Phileo Allied participation
will be in the form of RM1 billion investment in preference shares
in RHB. The preference shares carry the option to convert into RHB
Capital shares at RM3.20 a share for the first five years and
RM3.30 a share for the next five years.
	   In return, Phileo will be given certain veto rights over future
restructuring at RHB Bank, particularly as regards to shareholding
structure. Upon completion, RHB will effectively acquire a `clean'
Sime Bank. Sime Bank had suffered RM1.8 billion losses for the half
year ended Dec 31, 1997.
	   The complex deal involves several steps that would see the
merged RHB Bank and Sime Bank recapitalised at RM1.98 billion and
the RHB group recapitalised at RM2.35 billion. It would see Rashid
Hussain's personal stake in RHB diluted to about 23.5%, from 27%
currently. The merged bank would retain the RHB brand name and
operate with a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 10.5%.

BOT calls on banks to re-adjust lending plans, NATION

<TEXT>
	   THE Bank of Thailand has exercised its legal power ordering
commercial banks to re-adjust their lending plans in the second
half of this year in an apparent effort to stimulate loans to the
cash-strapped business sector.
	   A letter, endorsed by deputy governor Tanya Sirivedhin, was
dispatched to all banks, requiring them to submit their plans by
June 11.
	   The order came right after the central bank acknowledged a 2.9
per cent decline in combined credit growth during the first quarter
of 1998. The figure was compared with the same period last year.
	   The letter said that banks' lending plans should be re-adjusted,
given the continued stability of the baht as well as a rising
number of deposits.
	   ''Liquidity problems in banks should be eased to a certain
degree, so that lending activities can continue [to boost the
economy],'' it added.
	   So far, banks have refrained from providing loans to local
companies as risks were relatively high in the midst of the
country's worst-ever economic era.
	   The central bank's economic data showed a continued drop in
credit growth. Commercial bank credits in November last year fell
17.6 per cent year on year. The decline continued in February. The
March preliminary figures also showed a drop.
	   The central bank also estimated that commercial bank credits
will fall further in April. As a consequence of the dry liquidity,
lending interest rates were also hiked.
	   Meanwhile, the BOT is reconsidering its stand on the financial
institutions' non-performing loans (NPLs) after the International
Monetary Fund said the Thai economy this year is projected to stay
in the negative territory of 4 to 5.5 per cent from the previous
forecast of 3 to 3.5 per cent.
	   Governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul noted that such reconsideration
will help the BOT estimate how much the banks needed for
recapitalisations to better cope with the rising NPLs.
	   However, he believed that large banks, whose recapitalisation
plans have been fully completed, should have adequate amount of
capital to clear the NPLs. Bangkok Bank's NPLs are expected to stay
at 30-35 per cent this year.
	   ''We will call for a meeting with financial institutions next
month,'' Chatu Mongol said.
	   He said that despite the shortened period of stop-accrued
interest from six to three months, loan restructuring is now under
way and that it will help reduce the NPLs of a number of banks.
	   As a result, banks are not needed to set their loan-loss
provisions higher, paving the way for them to continue lending to
the real sector in order to help cash-strapped companies out of
trouble.
	   Thailand has come under tight liquidity which threatens to
increase bankruptcies. Domestic problems discouraged banks from
lending fear their provisioning burden will exceed their ability.
	   Most foreign creditors have also shunned lending to Thai
companies amid rising risks.
	   Agence France-Presse reported from Sydney that the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia Ltd on Sunday became the latest of the country's
big four banks to reduce loan exposure to Asia, cutting it back by
8 per cent.
	   Its total loans to the region now stand at A$6.24 billion (US$4
billion), down from $6.74 billion in December.
	   ''We are not going through a dramatic pullback -- we felt we had
a modest exposure to start with,'' said Michael Ullmer, head of
risk management.
	   Most of the pullback was from Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea and achieved by not renewing loan facilities when they
matured.
	   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, whose share
price has suffered from the Asian economic crisis, said on Sunday
that its policy about doing business in Asia would become more
conservative.
	   ANZ has the largest exposure to Asia of the major Australian
banks.
	   Earlier this year, its rating outlook was downgraded from stable
to negative by ratings agencies Standard and Poor's and Moody's
Investors Service as a direct result of its exposure to higher risk
markets in the region.
	   It has reduced overall exposure to Asia by 38 per cent from $16
billion to $11 billion during the first half of the current
financial year.
	   ''I would never anticipate our aggregate exposure levels to
increase from the current levels,'' chief executive John McFarlane
told Channel Nine television.
	   Exposure would drift down ''naturally'' from where it is.
	   Westpac Banking Corp last week said it had reduced its exposure
by 23 per cent during the past six months to $7.96 billion,
although National Australia Bank Ltd has indicated it is happy with
its $16.5 billion Asian exposure.

	   SP Food Industries (M) Bhd's proposed private placement issue
of new shares will increase the group's issued and paid-up capital
and improve its net tangible asset (NTA). The number of new shares
to be issued and the issue price will be determined at a later
date. SP Food's current issued and paid-up capital is RM16.1
million comprising 16.1 million shares.
	   The issue price will be determined based on the weighted average
of SP Food's market share price for the five market days preceding
the placement. An appropriate discount will also be determined.
	   SP Food said the proceeds will be mobilised to finance the
group's future operations and is therefore expected to contribute
positively to its long-term earnings. The proposed private
placement will allow the group and its subsidiaries to raise
additional capital without overly imposing on its shareholders in
terms of their financial commitment.
	   The group said it will place out all new shares pursuant to the
proposed private placement with appropriate foreign places to be
identified. The proposed private placement is subject to approvals
from the Securities Commission, Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, Foreign Investment Committee, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
and the group's shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting
(EGM).
	   The application for the proposed private placement is expected
to be submitted to the SC by the end of June.

	   FOREIGN capital inflows, worth more than Bt300 billion, are now
in the pipeline, but the debts of some companies, owned by the 56
defunct finance firms, have not been restructured due to the
Financial Sector Restructuring Authority's legal process.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul said the new
money is expected to flow into the country during the next couple
of months. The expected capital will be in the form of
joint-venture firms such as steel or property loan management
companies.
	   However, loans of these firms belong to the 56 troubled
companies whose debts are now under the management of the FRA.
According to the law, such debts must be auctioned and are
forbidden to be restructured.
	   Chatu Mongol noted that the central bank will negotiate with the
FRA to let these debts go under the hammer much sooner, so that it
will help keep the debt restructuring process going.
	   ''If we can restructure these debts, the expected amount of
foreign capital will flow into the country,'' he added.
	   Furthermore, the central bank is now undertaking a study on debt
restructuring to meet international standards in accordance with
the Office of the Currency Controller (OCC), a supervisory
department of the US Federal Reserves overlooking financial
institutions.
	   According to the fourth letter of intent submitted to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the BOT is required to go ahead
with the debt restructuring and re-estimation of collateral before
mid-June.
	   Hoping that the FRA's legal block will be resolved, Chatu Mongol
noted that such inflows will help strengthen the baht and
inflationary pressure would also be eased to a certain degree.
	   ''We are now trying hard to reduce illiquidity in pursuit of a
possible cut in interest rates, but inflation as well as the baht's
stability must be closely watched,'' he explained.
	   Meanwhile, the director-general of the Fiscal Policy Office
Sommai Phasee told Reuters the government is planning to issue
bonds of Bt500 billion in the local market within the next one or
two months.
	   He told the news agency that new money raised from the bonds
will help restructure debts of financial institutions.
	   ''Such money will help compensate short-term debts of the
Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF),'' Sommai added.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda was earlier quoted as
saying that the plan for a global bond issue worth US$1 billion to
U$2 billion may be delayed, given the regional market volatility.
The bonds were expected to be issued in July.
	   Sommai said the government is hoping to issue the bonds prior to
the end of the 1998 fiscal year, but the plan would be postponed if
the market condition is unfavourable.
	   Nevertheless, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi said
after the economic meeting Monday that global bonds will be issued
on schedule in spite of the regional economic battering.
	   But the Finance Ministry will be cautious about issuing the
bonds. The market situation and appropriate timing will also be
taken into account.
	   ''Thailand should make a speedy move to boost the economy and
restore foreign investor confidence,'' Supachai noted.
	   He also assigned the central bank to study the impact of the
economic slowdown.

Guerini wins grueling 17th stage, Pantani takes pink jersey 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes
<TEXT>
	   SELVA DI VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, the best
``Giro'' climber, beat Alex Zuelle by more than four minutes in
Tuesday's grueling 17th stage of the Tour of Italy ending in the
Dolomite mountains and snatched the pink jersey of overall leader
from his Swiss rival.
	   The bald-headed ace of the Mercatone Uno team placed second to
fellow-Italian Giuseppe Guerini at the finish line in this resort
of the Gardena valley and achieved his goal to wear the pink jersey
for the first time in his career.
	   With the two next stages including mountainous passes and uphill
finishes, Pantani has the chance to strengthen his lead and win the
1998 Tour of Italy which ends in Milan Sunday.
	   The stage victory was the first ever by Guerini at the Giro.
	   Pantani and Guerini broke away as the road climbed to the Fedaia
pass _ the next to last in a stage including four passes - and
Zuelle quickly slid three minutes behind.
	   The leading duo widened the advantage on the last mountain
before the finish _ the Giro highest point at the 2,214-meter high
Sella Pass - and Guerini won the two-way sprint at ease.
	   Zuelle, an against-the-clock specialist who had beaten Pantani
by more than three minutes in Sunday's individual time test at
Trieste, finished 4:37 minutes behind on Tuesday and fell to fourth
overall, 1:01 minutes behind the new leader.
	   Guerini completed the 217-kilometer (134.5-mile) stage from
Asiago to Selva di Val Gardena in six hours, 16 minutes, 58
seconds.
	   Pantani, who trailed Zuelle by 3:48 at the start of the 17th
stage, vaulted from fourth to first place in the standings 30
seconds ahead of Russian runnerup Pavel Tonkov, who finished fourth
at Selva di Val Gardena.
	   Guerini moved to third overall, only one second behind Tonkov, a
Giro winner in 1996.
	   ``When I attacked, along with Guerini, I just wanted to reduce
my gap from Zuelle,'' Pantani explained at the finish line, after
spraying cheering fans with champagne from the podium.
	   Thousands of enthusiastic people lined along the roads taking to
the Dolomite passes and to the finish line of the toughest Giro
stage so far.
	   ``I did not believe that Zuelle could lose so much. After the
bad beating suffered in the time trial (Sunday) I was dreaming of
revenge, of a day like today,'' Pantani said.
	   Pantani, 28, was a champion of bad luck in 1995 when he suffered
two consecutive bad spills and a broken leg. He was sidelined for
the entire 1996 cycling season.
	   Colombian Chepe Gonzales, who placed third 2:04 minutes behind
the winner, was one of the day heroes as he led on the road
climbing to the Fedaia pass and surrendered to Pantani and Guerini
only on the last tough uphill section of Sella, named Cima Coppi
after the late Italian ``Campionissimo'' Fausto Coppi.
	   Zuelle, who already lost and recaptured the pink jersey twice in
the current Giro, will have an opportunity to fight back in the
next-to-last stage Saturday, an individual time trial of 34
kilometers (21 miles) in the Swiss lake resort of Lugano.
	   Defending Giro champion Ivan Gotti, suffering from back pains
and with a gap of 12:42 minutes overall, did not start Tuesday.
Those who retired during the stage included Italian top sprinter
Mario Cipollini, winner of four stages this year.
	   Wednesday's leg of 115 kilometers (71.3 miles) ends at 1,760
meters of altitude of Alpe di Pampeago.

	   THAI Prasit Insurance Plc has acquired ownership of its
headquarters building and expects to buy another building once
Bangkok Bank of Commerce and a debtor-client reach an agreement on
the status of ownership, a top executive said.
	   A case being investigated by police which involves the two
buildings and allegations of embezzlement was being sorted out,
Thai Prasit chief executive Sukhatep Chansrichawla said.
	   ''We are prepared to clarify everything. It is not a case of
embezzlement as claimed,'' he said.
	   Sukhatep's comments came as Commerce Minister Supachai
Panichpakdi said he has been receiving reports regularly on the
insurance firm's move to solve any problem related to outstanding
debts by clients.
	   Supachai urged the media to check both sides of any insurance
news before publishing to avoid unwarranted panic by the public.
	   Sukhatep denied any fund misappropriation and said that of the
Bt800 million collateralised loan for the office buildings, the
Bt500-million headquarters building has already been transferred to
it, and the Bangkok Bank of Commerce and its customer will shortly
settle ownership of the Bt300-million ICE Tower.
	   ''The clients used the land title as collateral. There was no
damage to the company,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, he said that of the loans totalling Bt300 million to
three customers, Bt200 million was repaid. The remainder is due on
June 26.
	   The case is also under police investigation, but Sukhatep is
confident of clearing everything up.
	   He said an employee of a property and land appraisal company --
which is not related to the insurance company -- had falsified a
document. The case was investigated by the Insurance Office. The
person who faked the document was later found to have committed
suicide.
	   ''We did not have any knowledge of it but are willing to clarify
everything to the police.''

Romania and Macedonia ask for U.S. troops in Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Romania and
Macedonia urged the United States Tuesday to send troops to the
troubled Kosovo region.
	   ``Their presence would help to stop an extension of the crisis
in southeastern Europe,'' Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu
said after a meeting with his Macedonian counterpart Blagoj
Handziski.
	   The two did not specify whether they sought U.S. troops in
Kosovo proper or in countries the Serbian province borders, like
Macedonia or Albania. American troops are already in Macedonia, as
part of an 800-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission originally
established to contain a possible spill-over from the Bosnian war.
	   The two ministers said their governments would support the
autonomy of Kosovo inside Yugoslavia.

	   THE Siam Commercial Bank Monday clarified that it intends to
sell a total of 3.045 billion new shares to local and foreign
investors in a major recapitalisation for Bt40 billion fresh funds
to cover its position over the next two to three years.
	   Jada Wattanasiritham, executive vice president of the bank, said
the plan will increase SCB's capital from the current paid-up Bt5.8
billion to Bt40 billion via issuance of 3,400 million new shares,
of which 20 million shares, 146 million shares and 200 million
shares will be reserved for euro-convertible debentures, warrants
and new convertible debentures, respectively.
	   SCB intends to sell 45 per cent of the new offering of 3,045
million shares to Thai investors and the rest 55 per cent to
foreign investors to maintain majority Thai ownership of 51 per
cent. Currently, Thai ownership is 66 to 67 per cent, while foreign
ownership is 33 to 34 per cent.
	   Based on Monday's closing price of SCB at Bt17.75 per share, the
bank would have to sell 2,253.5 million shares to get a total of
Bt40 billion earmarked for recapitalisation.
	   At this stage, it is not known at what price SCB will get for
its offering and how many shares will have to be sold to get a
total of Bt40 billion.
	   Jada said SCB will offer new shares to 17 types of investors,
including the Crown Property Bureau, which currently holds 28 per
cent of the bank, and foreign insurance firms, among others.
Earlier, American International Group (AIG) was reported to be
interested in acquiring 10 per cent of SCB's equity.
	   Jada said SCB will have a capital adequacy of 18 per cent under
Bank of International Settlement (BIS) rule if its recapitalisation
of Bt40 billion is successful, up significantly from the current
10.6 per cent. At 18 per cent, SCB's capital adequacy will be close
to that of Thai Farmers Bank and Bangkok Bank, which raised Bt33
billion and Bt40 billion, respectively, in March and April this
year.
	   Jada claimed that the timing for the SCB's recapitalisation was
right, even though some market analysts have contended that SCB
would have fewer prospects of attracting foreign money after TFB
and BBL recently got a combined amount of more than Bt70 billion
from recapitalisation.
	   ''It is neither too late or too early [given that SCB would have
to compete with TFB and BBL if it were to recapitalise earlier],''
she said, adding that SCB will move swiftly to complete the
recapitalisation because there will also be competition for funds
from Korean and Malaysian, among other regional banks, for new
funds.

	   ELECTION Commission (EC) member Yuwarat Kamolvej Monday voiced
concern about achieving a high turn-out for absentee balloting
among Thai workers abroad.
	   The EC, tasked with organising national polls for MPs and
senators, has drafted a new regulation for absentee voting for
overseas Thais, as mandated by the new charter for the first time.
	   Yuwarat disclosed that the EC would hold further consultations
with Thai diplomats on the designation of polling stations and the
balloting procedures in order to facilitate voters' convenience.
	   The EC is particularly keen to encourage voters living abroad to
exercise their voting rights, specially in countries which have a
large settlement of Thais, he said. There are about 2 million Thai
voters living in various countries around the world, with the
largest concentration in the United States.
	   Thailand to summon envoys THE Foreign Ministry will summon the
Bangkok-based ambassadors of India and Pakistan to express its deep
concern on their series of nuclear tests which have badly affected
security in South Asia, a senior Foreign Ministry official said
Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan has ordered that the ministry
convey Thailand's deep concern to both ambassadors on the nuclear
testings which have drawn outrage from the international community,
ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said.
	   Kobsak said that the ambassadors, who will meet together with a
senior Foreign Ministry official, would be informed that the
testings will have affect on an economic pact which comprises
Bangladesh, India, Burma, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
	   Fume checking resumes ALMOST half the vehicles tested by
authorities at 15 checkpoints throughout the city Monday emit fumes
exceeding legal limits.
	   Municipal police, traffic police and Pollution Control
Department officials Monday resumed operations at the checkpoints
after they were temporarily shut down since April following
allegations of police extortion.
	   Out of 678 vehicles tested Monday, 316, comprising 47 cars and
269 buses and trucks, did not pass the test.
	   The checkpoints by the three bodies which started operating in
October last year had collected over Bt8.9 million in fines. Under
the Land Transport Act, motorists whose vehicles emit excessive
fume limits have to pay a fine of up to Bt5,000.
	   Tanayong project deadline THE scheduled commencement of service
on the Tanayong elevated train project in early 2000 may be brought
forward before Dec 5, 1999, to mark the 72th birthday of His
Majesty the King, City Clerk Prasert Samalapa said Monday.
	   ''The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration thinks that the
service should be available before the auspicious time, and has
therefore urged that the project be completed earlier,'' he said.
	   Reporting the project's progress, Prasert said conditions of
traffic lanes at the main project sites on major city roads would
completely return to normal on August 31.
	   Rice mill owners given relief Rice mill owners have been
temporarily allowed to hire foreign workers until authorities help
recruit Thai workers to replace them by next month.
	   At a meeting Monday of a committee to solve problems concerning
foreign workers, the Immigration Bureau told the mill owners that
they could hire until July 10.
	   The meeting resolved that a panel be set up, to be led by Labour
Ministry permanent secretary Niphon Bunyamani, to help recruit Thai
workers to work in the mills by next month.
	   More than 200 rice mills nationwide have reportedly been forced
to shut down since the government started repatriating foreign
workers in May.
	   About a hundred mill owners gathered last week to ask the
government to recruit Thai workers for them.

Italian friar sentenced for the murder of an African woman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERGAMO, Italy (AP) _ An Italian Capuchin friar who admitted
killing an immigrant woman was sentenced to eight years and eight
months in jail Tuesday, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   Fabrizio Moretti, 32, strangled the 22-year-old woman from
Sierra Leone in her apartment in this northern city last September.
	   Moretti was suspended from his priestly duties after the
incident.
	   When police came to the scene, he admitted killing the woman,
Aminata Harding.
	   He later said Ms. Harding had invited him to dinner and asked
for help in renewing her residence permit. Moretti claimed he lost
his head and strangled her when she threatened to report the dinner
to his superiors if he didn't help her stay in Italy.
	   The prosecution had sought a 15-year jail term.
	   The Ms. Harding had two children, who were awarded 100 million
lire (around dlrs 57,000) each in damages, ANSA said.

Ex-president's aide alleges sodomy at State House 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A former aide testified Tuesday that he
watched pornographic videos at State House with ex-President Canaan
Banana who is charged with homosexual offenses.
	   ``At times, he would ask me to commit what we were watching,''
Jefta Dube, 36, said on the second day of the trial.
	   Banana, 62, an ordained Methodist minister and figurehead
president from 1980 to 1988, has pleaded not guilty to two counts
of sodomy, three of attempted sodomy, and six of indecent assault.
	   Eleven people allege Banana made unwanted sexual advances toward
them.
	   Banana's attorney Chris Andersen intends to challenge the
legality of Zimbabwe's ban on sodomy and to cite gender equality
and privacy guarantees under the constitution, legal sources said.
The law allows consensual sex between women.
	   Andersen, who was justice minister under white-ruled Rhodesia,
said Monday that any sexual intimacy with Banana took place with
consent.
	   The case is being closely watched by Zimbabwe's gay and lesbian
communities who have been told by President Robert Mugabe that they
are ``lower than pigs or dogs'' and have ``no rights at all''.
	   Dube, a former police inspector, is serving a 10-year jail term
for murder.
	   Dube made the first allegations about Banana's homosexual
advances during his trial last year. Psychiatrists testified Dube
was only partly responsible for killing a constable he alleged had
taunted him for being Banana's ``wife''.
	   The prosecution claims top political figures and military
commanders covered up Banana's homosexual indiscretions.
	   Vice President Simon Muzenda and Justice Minister Emmerson
Mnangagwa are expected to testify. Dube claimed that he reported
Banana's assaults to Muzenda, who failed to take legal steps but
transferred Dube to another post.
	   Andersen said Dube's alleged dates of the offenses did not
square with the official calendar of events.

Government presents package to cool Danish economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Fearing that Denmark's good times are
on the verge of getting too good, the government on Tuesday
proposed a package of measures to cool the economy.
	   The Central Bank and private economists have been calling for
more fiscal restraint since last year, warning that the economy
could overheat.
	   The package, which must be approved by the parliament, calls for
measures including reducing the tax deduction for interest paid on
mortgages. It also wants to make permanent the mandatory payment of
1 percent of income into pension funds _ a measure that was enacted
on a one-year basis this year.
	   The government also wants to raise gasoline and heating oil
taxes by 50 oerer (3.4 cents) per liter (13 cents per gallon).

	   IN the March 1998 edition of leading fashion magazine, Vanity
Fair , Michael Shnayerson writes: ''With the looks of a matinee
idol, the determination of a Panzer commander and the pop-culture
antennae of a teenager, Tom Ford [Gucci's creative director] has
turned a tired Italian leather-goods firm into a US$1 million
international fashion force. Right now, Gucci is cooler than
cool.'' The reigning doyenne of fashion critics, Suzy Menkes, of
the International Herald Tribune agrees. ''He has a real sense for
of what modern marketing is about.'' It is that sense of marketing
that has made Ford's recent launch of Gucci first fragrance all the
more successful. The world famous designer has been behind Gucci
Envy for Men every step of the way and now Thai men too can revel
in the sexy parfum . ''Envy'' is a rich blend of secret ingredients
that are combined to reflect a sexy, cutting-edge modernity. The
overall effect is a complex manly fragrance tamed with a luxurious
elegance and the essence of desire. In an exclusive chat with The
Nation , Ford reveals how he has used his past experiences and
memories to produce such an impressive fragrance for the modern
man. To him, it's much more than an ordinary male perfume.
	   What is your best memory of being seduced by the power of
fragrance?
	   ''My grandmother. I used to go and visit her when I was a little
boy and she would pick me up and she always smelt the same. Even
two or three years ago when I bought the house that had been hers
-- it's in New Mexico -- I walked in and I could smell her -- she
hadn't lived in that house for 20 years. I always associated that
smell with fun.
	   Did you find creating Envy challenging?
	   I found it really fun -- I love fragrance, I love smell, I love
packing, I love bottles, I wear fragrance a lot, probably too much,
it was a lot of fun.
	   How do you feel when you wear Envy?
	   Again, there's that old word 'sexy'. But fragrance to me, and I
said this in the video [advertising the new product] is very sexy.
You need to want to bite the person wearing it. Fragrance to me is
a very oral thing. Even though it's not necessarily oral, things
that smell good usually make you want to put them in your mouth. A
great fragrance for me -- you do not want necessarily want to eat
it -- but you want to get really close to it so you can smell it
some more.
	   How did you approach the task of transcending the previous image
of Gucci fragrance?
	   Luckily I don't even think about the previous image of Gucci
perfumes and I don't think most other people do either. I don't
think the customer even knows it exists. It was the same thing we
were faced with when we wanted to relaunch Gucci accessories and --
luckily or unluckily -- most of our customers had died.
	   What was the inspiration behind the name ''Envy''?
	   Envy is one of those words that can be both positive and
negative. It has a slightly negative connotation because you are
taught that you should not feel envy and you shouldn't be envious.
But really it's just another name for desire, another name for
wanting something. When you want something someone else has, when
you want something you do not have, when you want something that
you used to have and you don't have anymore -- it's desire in a
sense.
	   Yet, I like that double meaning -- of it being a positive and a
negative thing. You know it's sort of bad -- it's one of those
things that you did not feel, but you do feel and it's sort of more
exciting that something that's so up front and obvious.
	   Do you think trends in fragrance and fashion need to complement
each other?
	   I think fragrance is a little more timeless and has a longer
life span. But certainly there are fashions to fragrance. What you
want to smell at a particular phase or particular era -- your nose
has to be led there by fragrances that come came before. Smell to a
large extent is a taught thing, there are obvious basic smells that
excite or repel you. Your nose has to be led to a place the same
way your eye has to be led to a place --what seems right at one
time can be wrong in the wrong time or place, so certainly there is
a certain fashion to smell as well.
	   There is a trend to use ingredients in men's fragrance that were
once only used in women's perfumes. Now they are acceptable for men
to wear. It's silly for a fragrance to be masculine or feminine.
Either something smells great and you love it or you don't.
	   What are the differences between the creative work in the
fashion industry and the creative work in the fragrance industry?
	   The creative work in the fragrance industry relies to a heavy
degree on technology and is a slower and more technical process
that the fashion industry.
	   How did you come up with the idea for the packaging of Envy?
	   We had just finished designing our new stores and I thought,
what do I want to see sitting on the counter top of our new stores?
We have developed an aesthetic that, with or without a logo, is a
Gucci look. Our customer lives or wants to live a certain way and a
perfume bottle is something that sits out on your dresser, in your
bathroom. It should be an enhancement. It needs to be something
that is attractive and an object that can stand on its own. I
wanted to create something that was very sculptural, something that
was a beautiful object.
	   Who was Gucci Envy and Envy for Men designed for?
	   A confident man and a sexy woman.

Russia won't revoke arms sales to India over nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will not cancel a lucrative arms deal with
India in response to its nuclear tests, and appealed Tuesday to
both India and Pakistan to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
	   ``Moscow is interested in preventing the escalation of tension
between Delhi and Islamabad, in neutralizing the dangerous
consequences of the nuclear tests carried out by these countries,''
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said.
	   He urged both India and Pakistan to sing the non-proliferation
and Comprehensive Test Ban treaties, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Belarus also joined the protests against the nuclear tests
Wednesday, saying they ``have sharpened our worry about a possible
chain reaction of nuclear proliferation not only in South Asia but
also beyond it.''
	   Belarus gave up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``Belarus, which several years ago has made a historic choice in
favor of discarding the nuclear potential it possessed, and which
is a party in a number of major agreements on nuclear disarmament,
cannot but feel a special responsibility and concern in connection
with such turn of events,'' a Belarusian Foreign Ministry statement
said.
	   The nuclear tests in India and Pakistan will be discussed
Wednesday, when Russia plays host to a meeting of top diplomats
from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ including Russia _ plan similar talks Thursday
in Geneva, and discussions on whether to impose sanctions, as
favored by the United States.
	   Russia has no plans to cancel its contracts for the sale of
Su-30 fighters to India, representatives of the Sukhoi aircraft
company said Tuesday, according to Interfax.
	   India already has received eight Su-30 fighters under a dlrs 1.8
billion deal to buy 40 advanced aircraft from Russia, concluded in
1996. The rest are expected to be delivered by 2000.
	   India is among the most lucrative customers for Russia's weapons
industry, and Moscow is eager to protect the much-needed market.

Two killed, two injured in Tehran explosion opposition group claims responsibility, CHANGES overline.

Eds: UPDATES with television reporting two killed, two injured;
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An explosion in a government building
Tuesday killed two people and injured two others in the capital
Tehran, Iranian television said.
	   An Iranian opposition group in exile claimed responsibility in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt. But
Iranian news reports indicated it was an accident.
	   The opposition Mujahedeen Khalq said its military units
detonated a bomb at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office, killing
``scores of torturers and interrogators.'' It said the building was
demolished.
	   The prosecutor's office apprehends and tries Iranians violently
opposed to the 1979 Islamic revolution that installed the rule of
clergy in Iran. The Khalq, the largest Iranian opposition, is
committed to overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force.
	   There was no immediate response by the Iranian government to the
allegations by the Khalq, which is based in Baghdad, Iraq and whose
members have also been targeted by the Prosecutor's Office.
	   Iranian television gave no details except to say two people were
killed and two injured in the midmorning blast in eastern Tehran.
	   However, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the
blast was caused by explosives, and indicated that the material was
being brought to the court as evidence in a case under
investigation when it went off accidentally.
	   The different reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   IRNA quoted an official source as saying that the blast was the
result of ``negligence in transporting the explosives related to
one of the cases under investigation at the court.''
	   In an earlier report, IRNA had said the blast was caused by a
briefcase bomb and that it injured three people. But subsequent
IRNA reports made no mention of the briefcase bomb.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq said it carried out the bombing in
retaliation for the slaying of eight Khalq members on Nov. 2, 1997
by agents of the Intelligence Ministry and the Prosecutor's Office.
	   In its statement, the Khalq said ambulance sirens could be heard
in the area for several hours after the explosions.
	   Later, security forces sealed off nearby streets and began
searching vehicles, it said. But the guerrillas who planted the
bomb escaped, the statement said.
	   The explosion comes as Iran is gripped by an intensifying power
struggle between the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami
and hard-line opponents who oppose his social and political
reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.

	   The farang lady who was telephoning me didn't give her name. As
she spoke, she sounded amused, though, as if she was inviting me to
join in a joke. I couldn't quite place her voice for a moment until
she said, ''So, Laurie. I understand you had lunch with my husband
today.'' And then I knew.
	   Well, a home-wrecker I'm not. The hours a reporter keeps are not
conducive to setting up as ''the other woman''. Besides, what man
looking for a home away from home would snuggle up to five cats, 25
fish and 10 turtles?
	   But I understand a farang wife's fears. Marriages break up all
the time in all countries, but whether the marriage is 10, 20 or
even 30 years along, there's something about Thailand that tests a
relationship. The give-and-take nurtured over years, the shared
memories and experiences of other times in other countries can turn
into an insubstantial dream of another life.
	   What does a farang wife face when she finds out her husband is
involved with another woman, when her husband tells her (if she's
lucky) that the marriage is over?
	   Apart from potential financial problems, she is lonely, her
self-confidence devastated, whether or not she's been happy in her
marriage. It doesn't matter if the other woman is a bar girl, a
secretary or a business associate. The wife is left in limbo as the
social circle she belonged to with her husband disintegrates.
	   I know a number of wives whose lives have suddenly been halved,
more or less. You can call the other women homewreckers if you
wish, but somewhere at the core is one unhappy man.
	   As far as possible, I think I understand the men who leave.
Living in Thailand has opened up new worlds for them. They have a
sense of freedom away from the constraints of society in their home
countries. Everyone here knows foreigners who do what they would
never consider doing in their own country.
	   You can joke about male menopause all you wish, but it's there.
	   Also there is the jolt the man gets as he notices other people
-- and himself. He's getting older. The hair is going, the body
too. He looks at his wife, his family, his life, and one day (or
night), the thought comes to him unbidden: ''Is this all there is?
Is this all I can expect from my life?'' It isn't the wife's fault.
She may be thinking the same thing about her life, for all we know.
But when he opts for the other woman, she knows he's being
self-centred, valuing a relationship so little that he can toss it
out without remorse.
	   He, on the other hand, doesn't think he's being selfish. It's
his last chance in this life for something more.
	   She says (more or less), ''Get real. This is all there is.'' He
says (more or less), ''Get real. This is not all there is.'' And
what of friends? Well, whether or not they agree with the man's
decision to end the marriage, they still see him socially. The wife
is dropped. Splat. Or they transform her from a weekend friend to a
lonely woman they invite for dinner on Tuesday nights.
	   They still enjoy gossiping, though. Well-meaning friends are
sometimes the first to inform the wife of the husband's outside
interests, as I was learning from that telephone call.
	   As soon as the lady made that comment, I knew who she was -- the
wife of a farang managing director of a major company here. Yes, I
had had lunch with her husband that day, along with two other
reporters from The Nation , as well as the man's secretary and his
public relations manager.
	   Somewhere in that restaurant lurked a ''friend'' who recognised
the husband, ignored the accompanying contingent and decided to
tell the wife about the strange farang woman sitting at the same
table. We finished our meal at 2 pm. By 2.30, the wife had been
informed.
	   Except that the wife knew immediately who I was. We're friends,
not close friends, just two people who enjoy each other's company
when we do meet.
	   So when the friend presented the melancholy news of her
husband's philandering, the wife burst into laughter. ''Oh, that
was just Laurie,'' she said. ''She must have been interviewing my
husband.'' I've often wondered about that ''just''. On the other
hand, I'm grateful for having been allowed the chance to
participate in crushing a nasty sort of friend.

Eubank in WBO cruiserweight rematch with Thompson 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former WBO world super middleweight boxing
champion Chris Eubank will fight American Carl Thompson at
Sheffield Arena July 18 in their WBO world cruiserweight rematch.
	   Eubank, who was hospitalized for three days after losing a
unanimous decision to Thompson in April, believes he earned a draw
in that match.
	   The 31-year-old Englishman missed two chances to beat Thompson
when he wobbled him and then knocked him down.
	   ``I knocked him down once and rocked him twice. This time I
would do a lot more,'' Eubank said Tuesday as the fight was
announced.
	   The April bout, Thompson's first title defense, was a brutal
encounter, which promises the rematch should fill the 12,000-seat
Sheffield Arena.
	   It was Thompson's 23rd victory against four defeats while
Eubank, former middleweight and super middleweight champion, is
45-4-2.

Talks under way in Air France pilots' strike 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with French comment, details on strike talks

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top brass at Air France sat down with striking
pilots' unions Tuesday in an attempt to keep the World Cup from
becoming a no-show event for thousands of fans.
	   The walkout at the World Cup's official airline, in its second
day, was already causing scheduling nightmares for teams preparing
for the soccer championship that begins June 10.
	   The president of the state-owned airline, Jean-Cyril Spinetta,
was among officials who opened talks at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) with the
unions representing 3,200 pilots, at the company's headquarters at
Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris.
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Spinetta said there was
``still a lot of work to do'' to settle the salary dispute with the
pilots and suggested postponing talks until after the World Cup
ends July 12.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta told the daily Le Parisien.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike, which was forcing tens of
thousands of people worldwide to look for other ways to travel.
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   At Charles de Gaulle airport, a shop employee sat alone Tuesday
in an empty store stocked with World Cup insignia. Opposite was a
newspaper stall where headlines read: ``World Cup held hostage,''
and ``World Cup in peril.''
	   After walking 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Paris to Chartres
over the weekend with 10,000 other youths on a pilgrimage, Ellen
Kerry was trying to get to New York on an Air France flight.
	   ``We only found out when we got in the taxi that there was a
strike. We could have saved the money and walked,'' said Kerry,
whose home is in Virginia.
	   At Marseille's Marignane Airport, passenger Pierre-Antoine
Graziani was getting fed up waiting to get on a waiting list to fly
to Paris.
	   ``I'm told something different from one hour to another,'' he
said. ``I might take my chances with the TGV,'' the high-speed
French train.
	   Air France said there would be a slight improvement in traffic
Tuesday, with 16-18 percent of long-haul flights taking off,
compared to 10 percent Monday, and 32 percent of short- and
medium-haul flights scheduled.
	   In total, 44 more flights were scheduled Tuesday, compared to
Monday.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   But the U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday,
said it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines,
connecting to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses in France.
	   Former French player Michel Platini, co-president of the World
Cup organizing committee, accused the pilots Tuesday of ``taking
the country hostage. ... This is the image of France at stake, not
necessarily that of an airline.''

Analysts predict Pakistan may declare moratorium on debt repayment 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with comment from state bank government, Cabinet
meeting; CORRECTS to dlrs 1.3 billion in 11th graf. ADDs byline
By ARTHUR MAX
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan may have to declare a
moratorium on repaying its debts as international sanctions bite
into its reserves, say financial analysts.
	   The government also may devalue the Pakistani currency by 3-to-5
percent to discourage imports that are further draining the
economy, said a report by the Dutch ABN Amro Bank NV obtained
Tuesday.
	   The grim outlook from one of Pakistan's top independent
analytical groups was a result of a drop in Pakistan's
international credit rating following sanctions imposed after it
exploded a series of nuclear tests last month.
	   The governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Mohammed Yaqub, said
the government had no intention of defaulting on its debts.
	   ``There is no consideration of a moratorium on any debt. We have
never defaulted on a single penny or a single day,'' he told Dow
Jones Newswires in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif cabinet met for six hours Tuesday to
discuss new austerity measures, deciding to trim the number of
public holidays from 20 to 11.
	   To symbolize the a tightening of belts, Sharif dispensed with
the cabinet's usual meat-snack lunch and ordered a simple meal of
lentils, rice and green tea, said the state-run news agency
Associated Press of Pakistan.
	   Pakistan declared a state of emergency May 28, blocking foreign
currency withdrawals for fear of a run on bank deposits of dlrs 13
billion. It also froze the exchange rate at 46 rupees to the
dollar.
	   Yaqub said such measures were temporary.
	   Until last week, Pakistan had one of the most liberal exchange
policies in South Asia, having made its currency fully convertible.
	   Government reserves were a paltry dlrs 1.3 billion a week ago,
just enough to cover three weeks worth of imports. Its foreign debt
is dlrs 30 billion, of which it repays an estimated dlrs 4.7
billion per year.
	   Standard and Poors, the international rating agency, downgraded
Pakistan's long-term and short-term foreign currency issuer credit
rating. That will make it tough for the treasury to borrow
financing for its six-month oil import bill of dlrs 926 million,
the report said.
	   ``The possibility that Pakistan may have no option but to stop
servicing some of its external debts becomes increasingly real,''
said the report.
	   A debt moratorium, it said, would do ``irrevocable damage'' to
Pakistan's standing in the capital markets and its ability to
compete globally.
	   After the U.S.-led sanctions were imposed, Prime Minister Sharif
announced an austerity program, beginning with his own move from
the newly opened 400-room government Secretariat, in a bid to cut
non-development expenses.
	   But the Amro report said the program was unlikely to help, since
nearly half _ or 47.7 percent _ of Pakistan's non-development
spending was earmarked to repay debts.

	   The gunman who pumped seven bullets into local legislative
leader Marti Batres' car Friday really was aiming at two other
people, with whom he had quarreled since school days, Judicial
Police Director Mauricio Tornero Salinas said at a news conference.
	   ``(Both persons) declared that the shots were fired at them
because they had had arguments since they were students in
secondary school,'' Tornero said Monday.
	   It did not seem the shooting was politically motivated and
Tornero suggested Batres' car simply was the mistaken target.
	   Tornero added the eyewitnesses and assailant had known each
other since scholastic days at secondary school No. 51, located in
Ninos Heros de Chapultepec, the same neighborhood where Batres' car
was riddled with bullets late Friday evening.
	   Batres was unharmed, while his car was parked in front of the
house of fellow local assemblywoman, Angeles Correa de Lucio, on
Santa Maria Nativitas street between Castilla and Bolivar. His
personal assistant, Jose Luis Santos, had to duck to escape injury.
	   Police say they know who and where the assailant is, although
they did not name him at the news conference held at Judicial
Police headquarters. Tornero said the two people who came forward
have given investigators a workable description of the shooter.
	   ``(The persons) declared before public prosecutors that they
recognize and fully identify the subject that shot'' at the car,
Tornero said.
	   Police said eyewitnesses told them the assailant didn't dismount
his orange sport-type motorcycle when he fired in the direction of
Batres' car.
	   Both Batres and Correa de Lucio are members of the Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD), the left-leaning party that controls
the capital's city hall, as well as the local assembly, known as
the ALDF.
	   The apparent assault on Batres and Correa de Lucio would mark
the 12th threat or attack of a PRD assembly member or official
since Jan. 22 of this year.

Swedish, Finnish forestry products groups to merge into world's largest 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with merger plans confirmed
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish forestry group Stora said
Tuesday it plans to merge with Finnish forestry company Enso,
creating the world's largest producer of paper and board
	   ``The merger is based on the excellent strategic fit between
these two strong companies, creating a global player in an
increasingly competitive industry,'' said Claes Dahlbaeck, chairman
of Stora. Dahlbaeck will also become chairman of the merged
concerned, to be called Stora Enso.
	   Stora and Enso together had about 90 billion kronor (dlrs 11.7
billion) in sales in 1997. Each employs about 20,000 people.
	   The merger will generate significant efficiency gains, estimated
at 1.9 billion kronor (dlrs 2550 million) per year, Stora said.
	   The new group will be number one or two in each of its core
markets, analysts said. Both companies concentrate on fine paper,
publications papers and packaging board. The new company's
negotiating power will work against the violent prices swings that
afflict sections of these markets.
	   ``The merger will help stabilize prices; it will make prices
less volatile,'' said Christian Grellety Bosviel, European pulp and
paper analyst at SG Securities in London.

Probe ended into former German governor's death 10 years ago 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUEBECK, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors closed a three-year
investigation into the 1987 death of a state governor Tuesday,
leaving still unsolved one of Germany's biggest postwar mysteries.
	   Uwe Barschel was found dead in the bathroom of a Geneva hotel
room 16 days after he resigned as governor of Schleswig-Holstein
state because of his involvement in a smear campaign against a
political rival.
	   Swiss authorities originally ruled the death a probably suicide.
	   But German prosecutors reopened the case on the basis of a
toxicologist's conclusion that it was unlikely Barschel was capable
of voluntarily taking a fatal dose of cyclobarbital since he had
already ingested three other sedatives.
	   New leads at the time pointed to possible links with the East
German secret police, North Korean agents or arms shipments to
Iran.
	   After closing the case, prosecutors said it was likely that at
least one other person entered the bathroom where the governor's
drugged body was found. But there was not enough evidence to
determine exactly the circumstances of his death.
	   Luebeck prosecutor Heinrich Wille said investigators pursuing
various arms deal theories even interviewed former Iranian
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr.
	   But neither an arms deal, nor involvement with East Germany's
Stasi or with North Korean agents could be substantiated,
prosecutors said.
	   And toxicologists remain in dispute about which drug killed
Barschel and when, making it impossible to confirm that someone
other than Barschel administered the fatal dose, Wille said.
	   A lawyer representing Barschel's family, which has maintained
the death was foul play, said he would review the decision to close
the case.

Romania seeks to collect billions of dollars in unpaid debts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania has begun efforts to collect
nearly dlrs 3 billion in unpaid debt left over from the communist
era, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   ``One of our main priorities is to recover this money,'' said
spokeswoman Anda Filip, after dailies published a list of 14
countries still owing money from goods imported before the
anti-communist revolt of 1989.
	   Iraq, Syria, Libya, Zambia, Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea are
the largest debtors.
	   At dlrs 1.7 billion, Iraq owes the most. Baghdad served notice
it would not pay, after Romania joined a U.N. embargo against it in
1990.
	   Filip said meetings with the countries concerned had brought no
results but efforts to collect would continue.

Two killed, two others injured in Tehran explosion opposition group claims responsibility, CHANGES overline.

Eds: UPDATES with television reporting two killed, two injured;
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A bomb exploded Tuesday afternoon inside the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's office in eastern Tehran, killing two
people and injuring two others, Iranian television said.
	   An Iranian opposition group in exile claimed responsibility in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt. However,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency said the blast was caused
by explosives, and indicated the material was being brought to
court as evidence in a case under investigation when it went off
accidentally.
	   The different reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   The opposition Mujahedeen Khalq said its military units
detonated a bomb in the prosecutor's office, killing ``scores of
torturers and interrogators.'' It said the building was demolished.
	   The prosecutor's office apprehends and tries Iranians violently
opposed to the 1979 Islamic revolution that installed the rule of
clergy in Iran. The Khalq, the largest Iranian opposition, is
committed to overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force.
	   There was no immediate response by the Iranian government to the
allegations by the Khalq, which is based in Baghdad, Iraq, and
whose members have also been targeted by the prosecutor's office.
	   IRNA quoted an official source as saying that the blast was the
result of ``negligence in transporting the explosives related to
one of the cases under investigation at the court.''
	   In an earlier report, IRNA said the bomb was in a briefcase and
that it injured three people. But subsequent IRNA reports made no
mention of the briefcase bomb.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq said it carried out the bombing in
retaliation for the slaying of eight Khalq members on Nov. 2, 1997,
by agents of the Intelligence Ministry and the prosecutor's office.
	   In its statement, the Khalq said ambulance sirens could be heard
in the area for several hours after the explosions.
	   Later, security forces sealed off nearby streets and began
searching vehicles, it said. But the guerrillas who planted the
bomb escaped, the statement said.
	   The explosion comes as Iran is gripped by an intensifying power
struggle between the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami
and hard-liners who oppose his social and political reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.

Portugal says it trusts its own investigators into Nazi gold 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said
Tuesday that Portugal had nothing to hide about its wartime
dealings with Nazi Germany and was keen to uncover any evidence
about flows of gold allegedly looted from Holocaust victims.
	   ``The Americans can say what they want. We are just interested
in the truth,'' Guterres told reporters in reaction to Tuesday's
publication in Washington of a U.S. government report detailing
neutral nations, including Portugal, with Nazi Germany.
	   Guterres said that Portugal had always treated the issue of Nazi
gold with total openness. He stressed that two commissions,
currently combing Portuguese wartime records, are due to publish
reports by the end of the year detailing the extent of Portugal's
dealings with Nazi Germany.
	   According to the U.S. report, Portugal provided Germany's war
machine with tungsten and other materials used to produce
weapon-grade steel. The report said the Third Reich paid for much
of this trade with gold looted from the banks of occupied countries
and the melted-down valuables of Holocaust victims.
	   The deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal said that earlier
investigations had already revealed that Portugal sold essential
raw materials to Nazi Germany during the war.
	   ``The wolfram trade was known during the war and was monitored
by the Allies, especially the British who we had informed about it
from the start,'' Luis Campos e Cunha said in a telephone
interview.
	   Documents discovered last year in the U.S. National Archive
showed that 79 truckloads of Nazi gold were sent to Portugal
between January 1942 and May 1944.
	   Portugal returned almost four tons of Nazi gold at the end of
the war following a detailed investigation of the Bank of
Portugal's gold reserves by Allied officials, Campos e Cunha said.

Albright: Economic progress in LatAm, but major problems persist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Democracy and free-market economic
reforms have helped reduce rural poverty and improve the lives of
women in Latin America, but major problems persist, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   ``Despite the progress, huge challenges of underdevelopment
remain,'' Albright told the Organization of American States. The
benefits of open societies and open markets must be delivered to
``not just some, but all of our people.''
	   Addressing foreign ministers from 34 countries, Albright said
children are staying in school longer, women are gaining more
access to education and health care, and 1 million people are to
receive loans for micro-enterprises in the next few years.
	   Still, overall poverty in the region has gone up since 1980,
with a record 210 million people now below the poverty line,
according to the OAS.
	   Latin America suffers the greatest gap between poor and rich in
the world; in some countries, 10 percent of the population controls
50 percent or more of the wealth, the OAS says.
	   Albright's one-day visit to Caracas was to end Tuesday when she
departs for Washington and then Geneva for talks on nuclear testing
in India and Pakistan. She urged OAS delegates to strongly condemn
the testing.
	   The three-day OAS meeting, which ends Wednesday, is to address
subjects including corruption, drug trafficking, poverty and
consolidating democracy.

Russian markets bounce back slightly as Yeltsin lectures `oligarchs' comments, taxpayers' meeting. CHANGES byline. 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian markets bounced back Tuesday as President
Boris Yeltsin convened an extraordinary meeting of the country's
most powerful business tycoons to map out a strategy of economic
recovery.
	   Shaking his finger at 10 of the ``oligarchs'' who control the
country's banking conglomerates, Yeltsin urged them to do more to
keep investors from pulling their money out of the Russian economy.
	   ``Our meetings are rare,'' Yeltsin said. ``Only when it's too
much to bear, when the government is in trouble, when the economy
begins to crack, when foreign investors begin to flee, and when our
own investors won't keep their money here.''
	   Russia's financial markets, which have performed miserably this
year, plummeted in a near freefall last week. Economists blamed a
convergence of factors, including fallout from the Asian economic
crisis, a drop in world oil and gas prices, and a coal miners'
strike that called attention to the government's failure to ensure
that workers are paid.
	   Russian stocks rose 12 percent in thin trading Tuesday and the
ruble strengthened. But some analysts cautioned that the rebound
might be temporary.
	   ``It's a little dead-cat bounce,'' said Fred Berliner, head of
trading at the Troika Dialog brokerage in Moscow. ``Whether it will
last, I don't know. But my feeling is that it won't last for
long.''
	   Russia's inept tax collection system is at the heart of the
country's current financial crisis, and Yeltsin also summoned top
law enforcement officials to his office to demand better efforts.
	   ``The tax situation has not improved, only worsened,'' Yeltsin
said gruffly in footage broadcast on national television.
	   Russia has no taxpaying tradition and many individuals and
companies can't afford its steep new taxes. Last year, only 5
million of the nation's 147 million citizens paid taxes.
	   Tax chief Boris Fyodorov agreed that the system was not working
and called for lower taxes to encourage compliance.
	   ``So far, the government was pretending to collect taxes and the
people were pretending to pay them, so we have to change this
strange habit,'' he said at the inaugural meeting of the Union of
Russian Taxpayers.
	   ``But I firmly believe that unless you cut taxes, in a country
which didn't have a tax system for a long time, it's very difficult
to make people pay very high taxes. So you lower taxes and then you
hit hard. Carrot and stick. That's the only way I think can be
efficient.''
	   Before Tuesday, the Russian stock market had fallen 44 percent
in the past month, and many analysts feared the crisis could lead
to a run on the ruble.
	   A top Central Bank official said the bank has spent nearly dlrs
1 billion in reserves over the past month to support the ruble,
which strengthened slightly Tuesday to around 6.16 to the dollar.
	   Deputy Chairman Sergei Alexashenko said the bank still has dlrs
14.6 billion in reserves, higher than some traders have assumed. He
said the bank has not had to intervene in recent days.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or someone else. But Deputy
Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said Russia is working within the
bounds of earlier agreements rather than considering emergency
measures, Interfax reported.

Cuban agency says Cuban players could play in U.S. _ but as a team 
</HEADLINE>
By LUIS R. VARELA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuba on Tuesday opened the door to
the possibility that its baseball players could play in the U.S.
Major Leagues _ but only if they play as a Cuban team.
	   The idea, according to the Cuban government's Prensa Latina news
agency, could ease political friction generated by the defections
of top Cuban athletes who end up in the United States.
	   ``Instead of the instigation of talent scouts against (Cuban)
players, it would be more logical to enter negotiations to ...
reach a solution favorable to all parties,'' Prensa Latina said.
	   Tuesday's dispatch, which cited Cuban government sports
officials, was the first time in recent years that the possibility
of allowing Cubans to play Major League Baseball was so candidly
discussed.
	   Cuba's amateur sports establishment has seen a wave of
defections by athletes hoping to compete as professionals abroad.
Cuban officials condemned the defections as a strategy by Cuba's
enemies to undermine its communist system.
	   Professional sports are banned in Cuba. While top athletes
receive favored treatment, salaries run about dlrs 10 a month and
living standards pale beside those of millionaire athletes abroad.
	   Prensa Latina said Tuesday that one obstacle to Cubans playing
in the United States was the U.S. embargo against Cuba, which it
said would prevent players who didn't want to defect from sending
their earnings home.
	   It cited the example of the late Cuban chess grandmaster
Guillermo Garcia, who in 1988 wasn't allowed to take home dlrs
10,000 he won in a New York tournament.
	   Prensa Latina said various Major League teams have shown
interest in establishing training camps in Cuba but were barred
from doing so under U.S. law.
	   ``Wouldn't it be better to reach an agreement with the Cubans?''
it said.
	   Cuba has permitted some players to join professional leagues in
Japan, Europe or Latin America after retiring from Cuban sports,
but it said recently that it was ending that practice.
	   In March, four Cuban baseball players and a coach reached the
Bahamas on a raft. One player was allowed to go to Japan because he
has a Japanese wife, but the rest were repatriated to Cuba on May
18.
	   In December, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez defected by raft. He
was allowed into Costa Rica and signed a dlrs 6.6 million,
four-year contract with the New York Yankees.
	   Other defector players have included Hernandez's half-brother,
Livan, of the Florida Marlins and major leaguers Rene Arocha,
Osvaldo Fernandez, Rey Ordonez, Ariel Prieto and Rolando Arrojo.

	   THE international community is of the opinion that Pakistan and
India should hold talks to ease the tension following their
tit-for-tat nuclear tests. After causing dissapointment across the
globe - with Asian countries being as vocal in opposing the tests -
leaders of both governments must recognise the fact that prolonged
conflict will have disasterous results. The last thing anybody
wants is another war breaking out in the Indian sub-continent. All
outstanding issues which had prompted such tests must be resolved
amicably. Let's not forget that nobody has ever emerged a true
winner in a military confrontation. The First and Second World Wars
proved this.
	   There were signs over the weekend that Pakistan was willing to
apply a ``coolant'' to its relations with India. Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Sunday that his Government's policy
to solve the outstanding issues with India remained and his
commitment towards a stable South Asia must be respected by all
parties. But Sharif's noncommittal stance as to whether Pakistan
was ready to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and sign
the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is seen by analysts as a
stumbling block for the intended meeting with New Delhi. At the
same time, news that Pakistan is developing a new long-range
missile to carry nuclear warheads is rather alarming.
	   India's five nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13 followed by
Pakistan's six blasts two weeks later have fuelled widespread
international concern of a dangerous arms race between the two
countries. The tests were met with worldwide condemnation and
punitive sanctions on both countries by the US, Japan and several
other countries. Pakistan's decision - despite the threat of
sanctions - to match the nuclear tests of its arch-rival, India,
and the euphoria that has gripped the country in the last few days
can be understood only in terms of the blood feud that has
preoccupied Pakistan for half a century.
	   Successive governments in Pakistan have been obsessed with
nuclear weaponry ever since India conducted its first test in 1974.
As reports spread, over the years, of Pakistan's nuclear progress,
the military and political leadership came to view the nuclear
threat as a deterrent to India's overwhelming military power. This
belief was strengthened by two events. In 1984, the Indian army
conducted a major exercise that massed troops some eight miles from
the border. Pakistani officials warned that this could mean war and
intimated that nuclear weapons might be used. The Indian Prime
Minister at the time, Rajiv Ghandi, said he had not been informed
of the exercise and withdrew the troops. In 1990 as unrest mounted
in Kashmir, India, believing that weapons were pouring in from
Pakistan, again moved troops near the border. The US Director of
Central Intelligence, Robert Gates, flew out in an emergency
mission and defused the crisis.
	   India, too, is plagued by its own domestic problems. There is
Kashmir, the war being waged by militant Sikhs fighting for an
independent Khalistan state, conflict in Assam and the Tamil
separatist movement in the south. However, both countries never
seemed to realise that the on- going confrontation, which has so
far claimed thousands of lives, will be very difficult to contain
should they each cling to national pride. The politics of arrogance
have proven fatal to the spirit of neighbourliness.
	   The time has come for Pakistan and India to address their
differences with regard to regional stability and peace. As the
world moves towards a total ban on nuclear weapons, the two
neighbouring countries must take into account the great devastation
caused by their last three bitter wars and imagine the possible
damage nuclear bombs could inflict, should they lose their balance
in making decisions. No doubt, Kashmir is still an outstanding
issue but somehow or rather, a solution must be reached.
	   Instead of playing on sentiment, they must focus on mutual
development and respect as well as on bilateral cooperation for the
benefit of both their peoples. Wasn't this the agreement reached by
Mahatma Gandhi when the two countries' separated half a century
ago?

	   RHB Bank Bhd has opened a branch on the ground level of the
shopping mall within Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The branch, which
was relocated from the MNI Twin Towers, features the RHB Online
System whereby customers can conduct financial transactions via a
personal computer available at the branch. The bank currently
operates from 9.30am to 4pm, but the hours will be extended and
Sunday banking is on the cards, said Tan Sri Rashid Hussain, who
witnessed the opening of the branch. The concept of the KLCC branch
is an enhancement of the bank's 1-Utama Shopping Mall branch
design, which was recently awarded the Most Outstanding Branch
Innovation Award by Asian Banking. The 1-Utama branch is a sales
and service outlet with a primary role to originate new businesses,
cross-sell products and service customers for all levels, ranging
from retail to corporate customers.

	   THE Asean Insurance Training Fund will be providing 75
scholarships to qualified insurance personnel in Asean to attend
training at the Malaysian Insurance Institute (MII) over the next
five years.
	   In addition, the fund will also be sponsoring short technical
courses ranging from underwriting and claims to actuarial and
takaful insurance, said Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohamed
Don when launching the fund in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   ``These short courses are expected to attract not less than 300
participants from Asean over a five-year period,'' he said.
	   The fund is an idea initiated by the Malaysian Government at the
first Asean Finance Ministers' Meeting in Phuket last March and is
aimed at facilitating the creation of a pool of qualified insurance
personnel in the region.
	   ``The fund is provided by the Malaysian insurance industry with
a ringgit-for-ringgit matching grant by the Malaysian Government,''
he said adding that the fund can be one of the platforms through
which Asean members will build expertise in insurance and at the
same time foster closer relationship among the players.
	   Currently, the Government has contributed a total of RM3 million
while the industry has contributed another RM3 million, making the
total sum currently available RM6 million.
	   ``The fund will be sponsoring one candidate from each Asean
member country to pursue the Diploma in Insurance and Risk
Management course at MII,'' he said.
	   Each scholarship is valued at RM13,500 and is intended to cover
the tuition fees for the diploma and associateship courses.
	   The fund will be managed by MII which will also provide the
facilities to conduct the two courses, the Diploma in Insurance and
Diploma in Risk Management as well as the MII Associateship
technical training programmes.
	   MII has already sent applications for the scholarships to all
respective insurance bodies in the Asean countries comprising
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brunei
and the Philippines.
	   After the launch Ahmad Don officiated the MII Annual Public
Lecture 1998 on ``Moving into the New Millenium - An Appraisal and
Rating of Insurance Industry''.
	   He added that with increasing globalisation and liberalisation,
it is imperative for insurers to re-examine their operations and
capability to meet the new challenges.

Bosnian Serb suspect pleads innocent to war crimes charges

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Serb prison
chief indicted for atrocities against Muslims and Croats at an
infamous camp pleaded innocent to war crimes charges Tuesday.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
Milojica Kos entered a plea of innocence to 11 counts of war crimes
and crimes against humanity for atrocities allegedly committed at
the notorious Omarska prison camp in northwestern Bosnia.
	   Kos, 35, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if
convicted. The U.N. court did not immediately set a trial date.
	   Asked by judges if he had anything to tell them, Kos responded:
``I have faith in justice and God, nothing more.''
	   A police officer, Kos's indictment alleges he was a shift
commander at Omarska who commanded camp guards who ``regularly and
openly killed, raped, tortured and beat'' prisoners.
	   Kos and other leaders at Omarska ``knew or had reason to know''
that their underlings were about to commit these crimes and failed
to stop them or punish the perpetrators, according to the
indictment, which was issued in February 1995.
	   Omarska was a makeshift prison camp established after Serb
forces took control of the Prijedor district of northwestern Bosnia
in May 1992.
	   About 3,000 Muslims and Croats from the area were rounded up and
taken to the camp.
	   Three other suspects linked to atrocities at Omarska _ Miroslav
Kvocka, Mladen Radic and Zoran Zigic _ are already in tribunal
custody in The Hague and awaiting trial.
	   Kos was arrested by NATO-led forces last week in the
northwestern Bosnian town of Banja Luka and transferred to The
Hague.
	   He is the 27th suspect in custody out of 74 publicly indicted by
the court, set up in 1993 by the U.N. Security Council to bring to
justice those responsible for atrocities in the wars that raged in
the former Yugoslavia after its split.
	   The tribunal's two most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, remain free.

PRECEDE Milan, Italy Italian reform effort seems dead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Constitutional reform in Italy was on its deathbed
Tuesday, but political leaders said they were putting the funeral
off until next week.
	   A vote had been scheduled on an article reshaping the role of
the president. But a squabble over presidential powers scrapped the
vote, and after a meeting of party whips, legislators said they the
would take up the matter June 10.
	   ``On Wednesday, June 10, the Chamber will meet and it will
acknowledge that the conditions to continue the reforms no longer
exist,'' Gustavo Selva, deputy whip for the right-wing National
Alliance, told The Associated Press.
	   He said the chairman of the parliamentary committee that has
been working on the reforms for nearly 18 months, Democratic Left
leader Massimo D'Alema, still may try to convene committee leaders
for a last-ditch effort.
	   ``We would need a miracle'' for the reforms to continue, D'Alema
said in a speech to the chamber. ``Let's hope it happens.''
	   Premier Romano Prodi insisted earlier Tuesday that his
government's stability doesn't depend on the fight over
constitutional reforms.
	   Prodi had said he wants the reforms approved by a large majority
as a sign of wide support for constitutional change. But new
objections from the center-right opposition apparently caused the
breakdown.
	   Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi wants the president to have
the power to dissolve Parliament any time, rather than only when
the government resigns.
	   The center-left traditionally opposes a strong president, a
reaction against the 20-year dictatorship of Fascist leader Benito
Mussolini.
	   Political commentators and leaders were groping in the dark over
what the next step would be if the reform plans break down. They
also envision reshaping the legislature and judicial system.
	   Possibilities include the forming of a constituent assembly to
rewrite the constitution, changing the constitution by popular
referendum or chipping away at reform through ordinary laws.

Rolls-Royce parent warns late bid could be troublesome AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars on
Tuesday called a 430 million pound (dlrs 700 million) bid from
Volkswagen a good, solid offer _ and said any last-minute
approaches would face big obstacles.
	   Plans to sell Rolls-Royce to the Germans were thrown somewhat
into question Monday, when a group of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts said
they were planning a higher bid with the intent of keeping the
company British.
	   Vickers PLC has called a special meeting Friday for shareholders
to vote on Volkswagen's offer. The company has not yet received any
kind of bid from the British group, which calls itself Crewe Motors
and is run by a lawyer, Michael Shrimpton, who previously led a
failed effort to bid for Rolls-Royce.
	   Vickers has acknowledged any that last-minute bid, if credible,
could force it to delay its plans. Shrimpton told a reporter
Tuesday he was still hoping to deliver a bid by late Wednesday.
	   But Tuesday, Vickers sought to defend its current deal with
Volkswagen, saying in a statement that it had ``the achievement of
good and reliable value for shareholders uppermost in its mind,''
and that it didn't want to lightly unravel a solid deal for selling
Rolls-Royce.
	   Vickers noted ``press speculation that it may shortly receive a
proposal from a private consortium,'' and warned that if the deal
with Volkswagen is not approved Friday, the ``current timetable
will be lost,'' which could pose risks for shareholders not getting
as much money in the long run.
	   Vickers also said Volkswagen would probably have to pay between
460 million pounds (dlrs 750 million) and 470 million pounds (dlrs
766 million) to close the deal. Volkswagen agreed in its bid to
repay Vickers for any investment that it makes in Rolls-Royce in
the interim _ mirroring terms of an earlier deal Vickers had
reached with BMW.
	   BMW had bid just 340 million pounds (dlrs 554 million) and was
outgunned by Volkswagen. A BMW spokesman affirmed Tuesday that BMW
has no plans to change its bid.

Portugal says it trusts its own investigators into Nazi gold 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said
Tuesday that Portugal had nothing to hide about its wartime
dealings with Nazi Germany and was keen to uncover any evidence
about flows of gold allegedly looted from Holocaust victims.
	   ``The Americans can say what they want. We are just interested
in the truth,'' Guterres said in response to a publication in
Washington of a U.S. government report about the dealings of
neutral nations, including Portugal, with Nazi Germany.
	   Guterres said Portugal always treated the issue of Nazi gold
with total openness. He stressed that two commissions, currently
combing Portuguese wartime records, are due to publish reports by
the end of the year detailing the extent of Portugal's involvement
with Nazi Germany.
	   According to the U.S. report, Portugal provided Germany's war
machine with tungsten and other materials used to produce
weapon-grade steel. The report said the Third Reich paid for much
of this trade with gold looted from the banks of occupied countries
and the melted-down valuables of Holocaust victims.
	   The deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal said earlier
investigations revealed Portugal sold essential raw materials to
Nazi Germany during World War II.
	   ``The wolfram trade was known during the war and was monitored
by the Allies, especially the British who we had informed about it
from the start,'' Luis Campos e Cunha said in a telephone
interview.
	   Documents discovered last year in the U.S. National Archive
showed 79 truckloads of Nazi gold were sent to Portugal between
January 1942 and May 1944.
	   Portugal returned almost 4 tons of Nazi gold at the end of the
war following a detailed investigation of the Bank of Portugal's
gold reserves by Allied officials, Campos e Cunha said.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) extended its slide
yesterday when the key barometer tumbled on news of contracting
gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year.
	   The benchmark KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) fell 20.24 points or
3.76 per cent to 518.00, its lowest level since January 15 this
year.
	   Last Saturday, Bank Negara Malaysia announced negative 1.8 per
cent growth in GDP, the country's first negative quarterly economic
growth in over a decade.
	   Analysts said blue-chips retreated on forced selling of certain
finance stocks and the market's fall was in tandem with the decline
of other regional bourses.
	   Turnover stood at 119.998 million shares worth RM236.095 million
from 127.625 million shares worth RM277.763 million last Friday.
Losses outpaced advances 511 to 95 with 126 unchanged.
	   Asia-Pacific bourses fell across the board on concerns of the
weakening yen and shrinking economic growth in the countries of the
region.
	   Jakarta stocks shed 1.5 per cent, Bangkok 3.9 per cent, Manila
0.8 per cent, Singapore 1.6 per cent, Tokyo 2.2 per cent, Hong Kong
3.6 per cent and Taiwan 3.8 per cent.
	   However, Seoul managed to buck the downtrend when it posted a
marginal 1.4 per cent rise on news of a May trade surplus.

Nigerian convicted of drug-smuggling in Belarus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A court in Belarus sentenced a Nigerian man to
seven years in prison Tuesday after convicting him of smuggling
drugs and forging documents, a news agency reported.
	   Calvin Chim Uzoma and another Nigerian were living in the former
Soviet republic illegally and receiving drugs hidden in toys mailed
from abroad, Interfax said. It said 509 grams (18 ounces) of
cocaine were found in a package from Brazil when the men were
arrested last fall.
	   The Belarusian security service said the arrests were the result
of cooperation with the Russian security service and the CIA. The
CIA provided information and interpreted the Nigerians
international telephone calls, the Belarusian KGB said.
	   Interfax gave no information about the second man arrested in
the case.

	   THE Government has extended the deadline for Samudera Dive (M)
Sdn Bhd to refloat the wreckage of the Chinese cargo vessel, MV An
Tai, which sank at North Port on November 23 to June 15, Transport
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said yesterday.
	   The 14,900 deadweight-tonne MV An Tai was to be refloated on
Sunday but Samudera Dive - awarded the RM4.7 million contract for
the salvage operations - had asked for time to patch up new cracks
that had appeared on the ship.
	   Samudera Diva had started salvage operations since March 9.
	   The cracks have to be welded to strengthen and reinforce the
vessel before it can be refloated and moved to Pulau Angsa where it
will be left to rest under eight metres of water, he told reporters
in Port Klang.
	   The Belize-registered cargo vessel, which was carrying
fertiliser, heavy oil and diesel oil, sank on November 23 last year
at Wharf 14 at the North Port, Port Klang. Its owner, An Tai
Navigation Enterprises Ltd, is based in Beijing.

Ukrainian government fails to pay wages, pensions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Workers and pensioners in many regions of
Ukraine are owed more than 2-1/2 months' wages and pensions,
Finance Minister Ihor Mytyukov said Tuesday.
	   Mytyukov also told parliament that nearly all the 800 million
hryvna (dlrs 400 million) the government collected in revenue in
May was used to pay wages and pensions.
	   Still, the government was able to meet only 86.2 percent of its
obligations, he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
However, teachers, medical workers, police and the army were paid
in full, he said.
	   The head of parliament's accounting chamber, Valentyn Symonenko,
said Tuesday that Ukraine was experiencing ``a total lack of
money.''
	   He cast doubt on the government figures for wage and pension
arrears, and said National Bank figures show a much larger debt.
Parliament passed a resolution Tuesday instructing the Cabinet to
report on the situation by June 9.
	   Mytyukov acknowledged that enterprises owe the state Pension
Fund nearly 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.5 billion), which will worsen
the situation.
	   More than one-third of deputies in the 450-member Verkhovna Rada
also signed an opposition proposal to debate a motion of
no-confidence in the government, opposition lawmakers said. Faction
leaders were to discuss the proposal later in the week.

Georgian armed forces not combat-ready, president says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's armed forces stayed out of
recent fighting in the separatist Abkhazia region in part because
they are not prepared to fight, President Eduard Shevardnadze said
Tuesday.
	   Shevardnadze blamed Russia for failing to meet a commitment to
supply Georgia with arms, and said it had left the Georgian
military unfit for combat.
	   Speaking to reporters, Shevardnadze also gave new, higher
figures for casualties in the clash between Abkhazian armed units
and Georgian guerrillas. According to the president, more than 300
Abkhazians and 16 Georgians died in the fighting between May 19-25.
	   In addition, six police officers and employees of the Abkhazian
Security Service died Tuesday when their car struck a mine in the
Ghali region, where the latest fighting took place, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war. Since then, fighting
has frequently erupted in and around the region.
	   Boris Berezovsky, the Russian tycoon who is executive secretary
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose federation of
former Soviet republics, is expected to go to Georgia on Wednesday
for talks aimed at settling the conflict, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In his remarks Tuesday, Shevardnadze called again for an
international peacekeeping force in Abkhazia, which Russia opposes,
and said Russian peacekeepers have failed to stop the fighting.
	   ``Now is not the time for political ambitions,'' he said. ``We
must understand precisely that there is no alternative to
reconciliation for Georgians and Abkhazians. ... The only
alternative is a war, blood and victims.''

New ruling on bills issued to importers, consignees, BUSINESS TIMES

<TEXT>
	   EFFECTIVE July 1, all bills issued to importers and consignees
must be accompanied by an acknowledgement slip to avoid wrongful
billings by Socotec (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   Socotec (M) Sdn Bhd is the collecting agent appointed by
shipping conferences to collect detention charges for full
container loads on their behalf. It has been acting as a
representative for shipping lines since February 1 1996.
	   The new billing system, described as ``more transparent'' by the
Association of Forwarding Agents Port Klang (AFAPK), was reached
following numerous meetings among the association, Socotec, the
Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) and shipping conference
representatives.
	   AFAPK chairman of port operations committee Yee Poh Tak said it
was at the April 29 meeting, chaired by Klang Port Authority (KPA)
free zone manager Paul Seo, that the agreement on the billing was
reached.
	   Business Times had last August highlighted the problem on the
billing system which had resulted in some importers being
blacklisted for not paying the detention charges as a result
thereof causing their cargo of not being cleared on time at the
port.
	   The importer in question then had to pay the fees required to
have his name taken off from the blacklist so that his cargo could
be cleared at the port.
	   Explaining the new billing system to Business Times yesterday,
Yee said when the haulier pulls the empty containers back to the
designated depot, he has to prepare the acknowledgement slip for
the depot to verify that the container has been received.
	   ``With this method, there will be no more cases of wrong
billing,'' he said, adding that the hauliers have agreed to bear
the cost of late charges if it is of their fault.
	   ``The importer will pay first, before claiming back from the
haulier later.''
	   Yee said AFAPK members will advise their clients to maintain
accurate record of the receipt and return of containers at their
premises.
	   ``If the detention charges are correct, and are according to the
importers record, then our members will advise their clients to
settle the charges within the specified period,'' he added.
	   However, he said, if the importer's record shows that the
container has been returned within the free detention period, the
importer should dispute the said charges by showing proof, that is,
the importer's container receive/return record.
	   ``The importer should file the dispute report immediately upon
receipt of Socotec's bill. This means it is imperative for the
importer to maintain good record showing when the hauliers have
been informed to pull the box and when the same has been pulled.''
	   Empty containers must be returned to the depot within seven days
of leaving the depot. If it is returned after seven days, detention
fees are charged to importers.
	   Problems arise after the importer clears or unstuffs the
containers and the hauliers do not collect the empty containers on
time, or they send them back to the wrong depot, by which time
several days have passed already.
	   ``We are very grateful to all the parties concerned for coming
up with a solution. We are trying to make Port Klang a
user-friendly port so as to encourage more shipping lines to use
it,'' he said.
	   ``We believe in consultation and cooperation. We do not want any
one party to lose out or suffer. This way, everyone benefits, from
the freight forwarder to the consignee and the shipping lines.''
	   Yee said freight forwarders previously had to do a lot of
running around on behalf of their clients to check with both the
hauliers and the depots as to when the containers were actually
returned. ``All this is done in our own time and at our own cost.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - The Works Ministry will be submitting three
working papers to the Cabinet soon on solutions to the water
shortage in Selangor and the Federal Territory.
	   The working papers would be covering specific solutions such as
speeding up the construction of a supply pipe from the Sungai
Selangor Phase II water treatment plant to the Kuala Lumpur area as
well as long-term solutions such as replacing all old water mains
with new ones.
	   Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said the working papers were
being prepared by ministry officials to be submitted to the Cabinet
in the next eight days.
	   ``We are now in the process of gathering comments from various
agencies such as the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's
Department and also the Finance Ministry.''
	   Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Selangor Waterworks
Department, Selangor State Government and ministry officials, he
said the working paper would also provide an update on the current
situation.
	   One of the proposals would be for allocations to subsidise the
speedy contruction by Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd of a supply pipe
linking part of the Sungai Selangor Phase II water treatment plant
and the Kuala Lumpur area.
	   ``The pipe-laying works are currently under way but Puncak Niaga
has informed me that it would take about six months. I have asked
them to study the possibility of completing it in about two
months.''
	   He said Puncak Niaga had been asked to study the proposal
immediately and present a report to him tomorrow.
	   ``The reason for me asking Puncak Niaga to complete the project
earlier is that I have been made to understand that the water
situation is expected to worsen after December.''
	   The supply pipe stretching about 40km will supply about 22
million gallons a day to several areas in the Kuala Lumpur area
when completed.
	   Samy Vellu said more water would be supplied as the capacity of
the treatment plant at Batang Berjuntai increased.
	   The Sungai Selangor Phase II water treatment plant is expected
to supply about 210 million gallons per day when completed in 2002.
	   He said the plant would produce about 105 million gallons for
the Klang Valley area when part of the plant operated.
	   ``This is expected to be in December, but we are asking Puncak
Niaga to start producing that amount much earlier.''
	   The Sungai Selangor Phase I and II project is expected to reach
maximum capacity by the year 2007 and water supply from other
States would be needed.
	   Samy Vellu said another working paper to the Cabinet would be on
the construction of a supply pipe linking Selangor and water
sources in Pahang which could supply up to 400 million gallons of
water a day.
	   ``It would cost about RM5 billion and the consultant enginneer
said that it would take about five years to construct,'' he said.
	   Another proposal, according to Samy Vellu, is to change all
water pipes in the Kuala Lumpur area from asbestos to steel within
the next 10 years.
	   He said the the changes, covering about 5,000km of pipes, were
important to reduce the amount of non-revenue water loss.
	   ``The ministry would ask the Cabinet to provide an allocation of
at least RM75 million annually to undertake the changes.''
	   On the situation at the Semenyih and Langat dams, Samy Vellu
said there were problems with supply to households which receive
water from these dams since supply from the catchment areas had
been reduced.
	   He said water supply to industries will be maintained at 100 per
cent, unless they were in housing areas involved in the rationing
exercise.
	   Samy Vellu also said ministry officials were looking into an
area near Fraser's Hill in Pahang to build a new dam.

Bulgaria's coach announces Wrold Cup roster 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev dealt soccer
fans a surprise on Tuesday, when he announced the soccer squad
would be going to the World Cup without playmaker Yordan Lechkov.
	   Bonev said that he had also dropped the third goalkeeper,
Radostin Stanev, and midfielder Kostadin Vidolov.
	   The goalie was dropped after first choice Borislav Mihailov _
one of the heroes at the previous World Cup _ recovered from an
injury.
	   Lechkov had contributed greatly to the team's fourth place at
World Cup 1994. Bonev did not say why he was dropped.
	   The coach announced the 22-man roster after the team returned
from preparations in Germany. They included a friendly with
Germany's champion Kaiserslautern on Monday, which Bulgaria won by
4-0.
	   Bulgaria's final roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Borislav Mihailov, Zdravko Zdravkov;
	   Defenders: Radostin Kishishev, Trifon Ivanov, Gosho Ginchev,
Ivailo Petkov, Adalbert Zafirov, Rosen Kirilov, Milen Petkov;
	   Midfielders: Ivailo Yordanov, Zlatko Yankov, Anatoli Nankov,
Krasimir Balakov, Ilian Iliev, Daniel Borimirov;
	   Strikers: Marian Hristov, Stoycho Stoilov, Emil Kostadinov,
Hristo Stoichkov, Georgi Ivanov, Lyuboslav Penev, Georgi Bachev.

U.S. agrees to sell navigation, targeting equipment: report actual selling 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CLARIFIES throughout that US willing to allow sale, not doing
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The United States will allow the sale of
advanced night navigation and targeting equipment to Taiwan to
enhance the capabilities of U.S.-built F-16 fighters, a local media
report said Tuesday.
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the U.S. Defense
Department was prepared to approve the sale of 28
Pathfinder-Sharpshooter infrared devices, along with training and
support, for U.S. dlrs 160 million.
	   Taiwan's Defense Ministry would not confirm the sale, but
spokesman Kung Fan-ding said the military ``looked forward,'' to
such purchases.
	   Taiwan has been worried about heavy pressure on Washington from
China not to sell Taiwan more weapons. China claims Taiwan as a
breakaway province, which is subject to forcible reintegration, if
necessary.
	   Taiwan bought 120 single-seat F-16As and 30 twin-seater F-16Bs
in 1992 for U.S. dlrs 6 billion. Eighty of the planes have arrived
so far.
	   The new devices would vastly increase night flight safety,
especially at low altitudes, CNA said.
	   Taiwan lost an F-16B and two pilots over the Taiwan Strait
during a training flight in March. The plane has not been found,
and no cause of the accident has been announced.
	   Taiwan has virtually remade its air defenses through the
purchase of the F-16s, 60 French Mirage 2000-5 fighters, and
continuous deployment of 130 homemade IDF jets.
	   The upgrade has allowed it to retire planes such as 1950s-era
F-104 Starfighters to meet the challenge from China's Su-27 jets
purchased from Russia.

	   THE Entrepreneur Development Ministry will introduce a logo to
be exhibited by franchise outlets to differentiate them from other
outlets, its minister Datuk Mustapha Mohamed said.
	   ``We will select one out of six logos available,'' he told
reporters after opening the first Deligiant nasi lemak franchised
outlet in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   The logo, which projects a standardised management of a
franchise outlet, is expected to be ready in two weeks.
	   Mustapha commended Deligiant Sdn Bhd, the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Giant TMC Bhd, for coming up with the first nasi
lemak franchise outlet.
	   ``The company can conduct an aggresive promotion and should try
to dominate the local franchise sector,'' he said, adding that
currently the market is being controlled by foreign franchises.
	   Asked on the ministry's role in assisting companies in trouble
due to the economic downturn, Mustapha said the ministry will ``go
to the ground to approve loans for petty traders and hawkers''.
	   On May 28, the Government allocated RM90 million to the Small
Entrepreneur Fund for small and petty traders.
	   He said even though the Government can only provide assistance
like funding and re-scheduling of loans on a short-term basis,
traders should devise their own plans. This can include increasing
liquidity and securing more contracts.
	   ``If the economic downturn persists, then it is impossible for
these small entrepreneurs to survive if they do not have any
long-term plans of their own,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   KOTA BARU, Mon. - Kelantan Religious and Malay Customs Council
(MAIK) deputy president Datuk Ashaari Azmi Abdullah told the
Syariah High Court today he lodged a police report against the
copies of text of a Hari Raya sermon distributed by the State
Government's information secretariat to safeguard the council's
credibility.
	   ``It was also to prevent any untoward incident from happening
since the text of the sermon was being circulated two or three days
before Hari Raya,'' he added.
	   He said the report was lodged on Feb 7 last year at the Kota
Baru police station, a day after he was given the text.
	   ``The text was written by the State Pas Dewan Ulama,'' he said,
adding that the action was not allowed under Section 5 (1) of the
MAIK Enactment on the establishment and incorporation of the
council.
	   The provision in the section also stated MAIK as being the chief
authority in the State in all matters relating to Islam and Malay
customs.
	   Ashaari Azmi said Friday and Hari Raya sermons issued by MAIK
were prepared by a panel headed by the State Mufti, with members of
the panel including the chief Imam and the deputy mufti.
	   ``The Friday or Raya Sermons prepared by the panel will be
issued to the imam to be read during the respective occasions at
the 527 mosques in Kelantan,'' he added.
	   To a question from Syariah deputy public prosecutor Abu Bakar
Abdullah Kutty, he said he did read the text distributed by the
secretariat.
	   ``The text does not contain prayer for the Sultan,'' he added.
	   Ashaari Azmi, a prosecution witness, was testifying in a libel
case involving Pengkalan Chepa MP Mohd Amar Abdullah.
	   Mohd Amar, 35, who is Kelantan Pas Youth vice-chief, had pleaded
not guilty in the Chief Kadi's Court in April last year with
insulting MAIK over the Hari Raya Aidil Fitri sermon in his ceramah
at Jalan Dusun Raja at 10.15pm on March 8, last year.
	   He is charged under section 121 of the MAIK Enactment 1994 and
if found guilty, could be sentenced to a maximum of three years
jail or fined RM5,000 or both.
	   He was alleged to have used the words ``not so intelligent''
(kurang cerdik) when referring to two or three MAIK officials in
his speech at the ceramah.
	   Mohd Amar is represented by Wan Muttalib Wan Embong and
Takiyuddin Hassan.
	   The hearing is before Syariah Court judge Rawi Mat Yaman.Datuk
Shukri Mohamed, whose appointment by MAIK to act as its prosecutor
was dismissed by the Syariah Appeals Court yesterday, was also
present to hold a watching brief for the council.
	   Cross-examined by Wan Muttalib, Ashaari Azmi agreed that the
MAIK Enactment did not mention nor contain the word ``khutbah''.
	   However, he said, MAIK had issued a directive that sermons for
Friday and Hari Raya prayers should only be those issued by the
council.
	   ``Only the imam of the mosques registered under MAIK are
required to read the sermons prepared by the council,'' he added.
	   To a question from Takiyuddin, Ashaari Azmi said there was no
relation between the report he lodged with the police on Feb 2 and
that of the case filed by MAIK against Mohd Amar.
	   ``I don't know him (Mohd Amar) nor was I informed of the case.
The matter was never discussed during MAIK's meetings,'' he added.
	   Two other prosecution witnesses were called to testify today.
They included former MAIK secretary Kamaruddin Awang and the
council's religious officer Othman Ibrahim. Hearing will continue
on June 18 and 21.

Croatian, Bosnian Serb prime ministers discuss refugee issue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The premiers of Croatia and of the Serb
republic within Bosnia agreed on Tuesday that refugees should be
free to choose whether to return home or sell their old property
and settle where they chose to.
	   Zlatko Matesa of Croatia and Milorad Dodik of the Bosnian Serb
republic met against a background of fierce international pressure
on Croatia to stop foot-dragging on permitting Serb returns.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs fled in 1995, when Croatian
government troops retook areas Serb rebels seized in 1991. An
estimated 50,000 found shelter in the Serb-controlled half of
Bosnia. Many of them live in houses of Muslims and Croats expelled
from the region during the Bosnian war.
	   On the flip side of the coin, Bosnian Croats driven out of
Bosnia now live in homes Serbs abandoned in Croatia. The Croatian
government argues that the Bosnian Croats should be allowed to
return home too, but only a few of the approximately 70,000 who
fled have been able to come back because of resistance to them in
former home areas now controlled by other ethnic groups.
	   Talking about a refugee agreement for the region to be signed
later this month, Matesa said it was based on the ``right of each
person to chose where one wants to live.''
	   Dodik said the Dayton peace agreement, which ended Bosnian war,
``envisages that every person has equal right to return, sell or
exchange his property.''
	   ``We want to offer people the opportunity to decide on one of
these three options,'' the state news agency HINA quoted him as
saying.

	   TOYOFUJI Shipping Co Ltd is planning to increase the frequency
of its calls to Port Klang from once a week to one call every three
days when it takes delivery of more vessels by the year 2000.
	   The company will take delivery of three more vessels by the year
2000.
	   Currently it is using its Panama-registered vessel, Transfuture
I.
	   The second vessel is expected to be completed by March next
year.
	   Transfuture I is capable of carrying 1,080 units of vehicles and
192-FEU (forty-foot equivalent units) containers.
	   It will ply the Yokohama-Nagoya-Keelung-Bangkok Port
Klang-Singapore-Jakarta-Muara (Brunei)-Kota Kinabalu-Hong
Kong-Tokyo route.
	   Transfuture I made its maiden call to Port Klang on May 31,
bringing in 10 units of vehicles, 50 tonnes of general cargo,
one-TUE (twenty-foot equivalent units) container and six-FEU
containers.
	   The vessel left Port Klang for Singapore yesterday after loading
31 units of Proton cars, 100 tonnes of general cargo, one-TEU and
26-FEU containers.
	   Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik was present at
the port.
	   Toyofuji currently has two vessels servicing North America and
seven operating in Asia out of which four will ply the Oceania and
three on charter routes.
	   Ling said Toyofuji ships are plying the Asian route due to the
volume of business generated by the local vehicle industry.
	   It has made Malaysia a destination for direct calls,
transporting national cars Proton and Perodua for exports to
markets such as Taiwan, Indonesia and Laos.
	   ``In addition, Toyofuji is also transporting Proton cars to
South America, West Asia, the Indian sub-continent and Africa.
	   ``Second-hand cars to Myanmar are also handled through Port
Klang.
	   ``Other international shipping lines such as Wallenius and
Hyundai also call at Port Klang to tranship cars by Toyofuji
vessels for regional destinations,'' he said.
	   Dr Ling said the number of main line operators to Port Klang has
increased from 10 in 1990 to 47 last year.
	   Port Klang has the support of more than 90 per cent of major
shipping alliances.
	   ``We are also witnessing an increase in the regional feeder
services from Indonesia, Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal area.
	   ``The latest is the feeder service between Port Klang and
Chennai which is operated by Konsortium Perkapalan Nasional and
Malaysia Trade and Transport Co Sdn Bhd.
	   ``This, together with other Asian destinations which are
serviced by feeders from Port Klang, will consolidate Port Klang's
position as a viable alternative for regional shippers,'' he said.
	   Dr Ling said the weakening of the currency has made Port Klang
an attractive alternative to other ports in the region.
	   Exporters, he said, will be able to benefit from the
Government's move to increase credit facility from RM1.3 billion to
RM4 billion for traders.
	   ``It is a welcoming move to the shipping industry. Eventually,
in about six months, the facility which is to support export
companies will be able to improve and expand their businesses,'' he
said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar had
last month announced the doubling of the credit facility for
traders.
	   The facility has been made available since May 21 through the
Export Credit Refinancing Scheme managed by Exim Bank Bhd and
channelled to all the banks in the country.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An explosion in a government building killed
two people and injured two others Tuesday in Tehran, Iranian
television said.
	   An Iranian opposition group in exile claimed responsibility in a
statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt. But
official news reports said the explosion in the Iranian capital was
an accident.
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest Iranian opposition group, said
it set off a bomb at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office, killing
scores of people and demolishing the building.
	   The prosecutor's office apprehends and tries opponents of the
1979 Islamic revolution that installed Islamic rule in Iran.
	   Iranian television said two people died and two were injured in
an explosion in Tehran.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the blast was
caused by explosives, and indicated the material was being brought
to the court as evidence when it went off accidentally.
	   The differing accounts could not be immediately reconciled.
	   IRNA quoted an official source as saying that the blast was the
result of ``negligence in transporting the explosives related to
one of the cases under investigation at the court.''

	   DELIGIANT Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Giant TMC Bhd,
expects to make some RM4 million in revenue from its nasi lemak
business this year.
	   Its director Mr Teng Yew Huat said the Giant Group's nasi lemak
outlets recorded RM2.5 million in sales in 1997.
	   Speaking to reporters after the official opening of the first
Deligiant franchised outlet at the Sunway Pyramid shopping mall in
Petaling Jaya, Teng said there are plans to have 20 such outlets by
the end of 1999.
	   ``We are helping the Government to achieve 1,200 new franchises
by the year 2000,'' Teng said, adding that 15 out of 20 of the new
outlets would be franchised.
	   The Deligiant concept is similar to the western fast-food chains
like McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken, except that Deligiant
serves nasi lemak, a Malaysian favourite.
	   ``We believe our franchise concept of a local favourite is the
first in Malaysia and unheard of in the country,'' he said.
	   ``We have had experience selling nasi lemak at other outlets and
it has proven to be a success,'' he added.
	   Teng said the company has always provided the best in terms of
pricing, adding that the food is hygienically prepared and is
available in a comfortable and clean environment.
	   Apart from that, the company also ensures that customers get
fast, efficient, and courteous service while having the food which
is served at a reasonable price and affordable.
	   Teng said the company has so far invested RM2.5 million in
developing the franchises.
	   Puan Nor Rizah Abdul Rahman, the owner of the first franchised
outlet, said she had invested RM128,000 which included a RM10,000
franchise fee, employees' salaries, dining equipment and nasi lemak
supply.
	   Themed the ``sambalicious nasi lemak'', the outlet offers nasi
lemak with ayam masak merah, ayam rendang, ayam goreng bertepung,
beef rendang and sotong sambal.
	   Teng said training and support facilities will be provided
through Deligiant. However, an entrepreneur will need to put up the
initial investment capital, and meet staffing requirements, among
other things.
	   Deligiant's first nasi lemak outlet was set up in 1993 and was
located inside the Giant Supermarket complex at Section 18, Shah
Alam.
	   It recorded RM650,000 in sales in its first year of operation.
	   A year later, the second outlet was opened near the TMC
Supermarket in Bangsar.
	   It was only in January 1996 that the company decided to develop
Deligiant nasi lemak into a franchising product, Teng added.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Although most items sold at supermarkets in
the Klang Valley were similar in price, today's survey on instant
food products showed a few were sold at exorbitant prices in
certain places.
	   Nestle infant rice cereal (250g), for example, was sold at
RM6.65 at the Hankyu supermarket in Bangsar while in other places
it was going for between RM2.45 and RM3.65.
	   Boh Superior Tea (50 bags) was sold at RM6.10 at the UDA Ocean
in Jalan Tun H.S. Lee compared with RM4.15 and RM4.85 at other
supermarkets.
	   Today's survey also showed that items were generally cheaper at
the Giant hypermaket in Subang Jaya.
	   For best bargains, consumers should compare prices at various
supermarkets, as some offered lower prices for certain goods.
	   In Ipoh, there was a marked difference in prices of certain
items sold at leading supermarkets.
	   For instance, the FN 2-litre cordial was quoted the highest at
Jaya Jusco at RM7.90 while it was only going for RM6.40 at Ocean
and RM6.90 at Super Kinta.
	   Jaya Jusco, however, was selling Naturel margarine at an
exceptionally low price of RM3.90 compared with RM5.05 at Super
Kinta. The item was not available at Ocean.
	   Nescafe (250g) was going at between RM15.90 and RM17.30.
	   There was not much difference in the prices of Maggi instant
noodles, evaporated milk, condensed milk and tea.
	   In Penang, prices of most of the commodities remained the same
compared with last Monday.
	   Everyday instant powdered milk (900gm) was selling at RM14.10 at
the Super Komtar while it went for RM13.60 at the Suiwah.
	   Condensed milk (FN) 410gm was sold at RM2.05 at the Super while
it was cheaper at RM1.95 at the Suiwah supermarket.
	   Meanwhile, Looking Good has ceased operations until next month
as it will be taken over by another company.
	   In Johor Baru, although prices of most items were similar at all
the supermarkets surveyed, each supermarket had at least one item
which was sold at a lower price compared to their competitors.
	   For example, Ocean supermarket at Taman Sentosa had the cheapest
FN cordial at RM5.79 per two litres, The Store at Taman Sentosa
had the cheapest Naturel margarine (RM5.40 per 500g) and Tops at
Pelangi Mall had the cheapest SCS butter (RM3.39 per 250g).

Hingis eclipses Venus at French Open, men's favorite Rios ousted 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Moya beating Rios, Seles winning
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing like the champion she is, Martina Hingis
ousted Venus Williams from the French Open Tuesday, ending the
American teenager's run in Paris.
	   But there will be two Americans in the semifinals. Monica Seles,
playing her first tournament since the death of her father, and
Lindsay Davenport both advanced with three-set wins.
	   And Pete Sampras, though thousands of miles away, can rest easy:
Marcelo Rios lost a chance to take the world's No. 1 ranking when
Carlos Moya defeated him in four sets.
	   Rios, the No. 3 seed, had been a favorite to take the title
after the early exits of Sampras and No. 2 Petr Korda.
	   Williams, who powered her way through the first four rounds, met
her match in the world's No. 1 player and lost 6-3, 6-4 in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I didn't play as well as I should have,'' Williams said. ``I
made too many errors. These things, I assure you, will be
corrected.''
	   Hingis last year won every Grand Slam event except the French
Open. Now she is two victories from capturing the lone major to
elude her.
	   ``She's raising her game,'' Williams said. ``Everyone else has
to raise theirs, too.''
	   Seles looked like her old winning self during her victory over
Jana Novotna, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Even the grunts were back. Seles
pounded her fist in the air in triumph after breaking Novotna in
the final game.
	   Defending champion Iva Majoli went down to No. 2 seed Lindsay
Davenport, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3. Davenport joked that she might be the
most overlooked semifinalist.
	   ``If I was a betting person or a journalist, I would overlook
myself also,'' she said. ``I don't have a tag. I'm just an ordinary
girl playing tennis and having success. That's a boring story.''
	   Moya, a talented Spaniard, was at the top of his all-court game
in his 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Rios. With Moya serving, the
Chilean saved three match points in the final game, including a
lucky net cord. That delighted the vocal Chilean fans, who waved a
big flag whenever he won a point.
	   But Moya fired an ace to set up the fourth match point, and Rios
netted his final shot.
	   In a showdown billed worthy of a final, Hingis used her deft
touch and court sense to wear down Williams. She almost always
seemed in control, never looking off-balance or rushed.
	   Hingis raced to a 3-0 lead, but Williams broke in the fifth game
for 3-2 as the Swiss star twice double-faulted. Hingis then broke
right back for 4-2, and held on to win the set.
	   In the second set, Williams had a chance to break Hingis for
2-0, racking up three break points. But Hingis won five straight
points to take the game.
	   In the crucial game of the set, Hingis broke Williams for 4-3 _
again on two double faults, this time by Williams.
	   Also reaching the semifinals was No. 4 Aranxta Sanchez Vicario.
The two-time champion from Spain lost a tiebreak in the second set
but recovered to beat Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-2, 6-7 (5-7),
6-0.
	   But another former champion, Thomas Muster, continued a
disappointing year with a quarterfinal loss to No. 15 Felix
Mantilla of Spain, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. The Austrian's ranking has
dropped this past year from ninth to 22nd.
	   Leading to the headline match, Hingis wasn't ready to call
Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
said. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.
... I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.

	   TOKYO, Mon: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who
arrived here for a five-day working visit today, expressed hope
that the regional economic problems will have minimal impact on
Japanese foreign direct investment to Malaysia.
	   ``I think it will be affected to a certain extent. There is no
running away from that, but I hope it will be minimal,'' he said.
	   Speaking to reporters upon his arrival, Dr Mahathir said large
Japanese companies are still interested to invest in Malaysia and
are continuing to do so.
	   He said at the same time, Malaysia is also getting a lot of
investments now from the US, particularly in the petrochemical and
chemical industries.
	   Dr Mahathir said companies like Eastman and Procter and Gamble
are investing in downstream petrochemical and chemical industries
in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.
	   ``The trend (of foreign direct investments) now is quite
different from before. It is not just in electronics,'' he added.
	   Japan is the second largest investor in Malaysia after the US.
Of Japnese projects worth RM4.6 billion that were approved by the
Malaysian Industrial Development Authority last year, 70 per cent
was for new projects and the rest re-investments or expansions to
existing facilities.
	   Asked if Malaysia is now opening up these sectors to American
investors, Dr Mahathir said: ``We welcome anybody, but the
Americans seem very keen on the chemicals sector, with large
investments.''
	   During his visit here, the Prime Minister is scheduled to have
several private meetings with Japanese businessmen.
	   He is also scheduled to speak at a Symposium on ``Revitalisation
of the Japanese Economy and the Future of Asia'' tomorrow.
	   The symposium is organised by the Institute for International
Monetary Affairs, a non-profit research institute for international
monetary studies.
	   On Thursday, Dr Mahathir will deliver the keynote address at the
Nikkei International Conference on ``Future of Asia''.
	   The conference, sponsored by Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc, is
expected to discuss among other things, Asian-style corporate
management, achieving stable financial systems in Asia, and
regional stability.
	   Earlier, Dr Mahathir was received at the Narita International
Airport by Malaysian Ambassador to Japan, Tan Sri H.M. Khatib.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun
Razak today said there is a slight delay in dispensing the annual
grants to schools but the cheques are being processed.
	   Schools would be getting their grants ``immediately'' but
allocations for certain programmes had been cut. This included
funds for the library, counselling and guidance, and resource
education.
	   Most schools have received half of their annual grants but those
which had not said they were facing financial difficulties. They
were coping by cutting expenditure, prioritising payment of bills
or asking for time to pay. Besides the delay, schools were also
given only half the yearly grant, a departure from previous years.
	   The allocation, known as the per-capita grant, is used to pay
utility bills, administrative and maintenance costs, and stationery
purchases.
	   It was reported today that schools in Selangor and the Federal
Territory have yet to receive their grants, while those in the
other States were given only half and promised the rest by next
month.
	   The Johor Education Department which had distributed the money
to the schools last month, urged those which had not received the
grant to check with the district education office.
	   Schools in Johor Baru which had not received grants said they
were ``spending according to priority using the balance of last
year's allocation''.
	   Some have asked for open invoices with their suppliers to be
paid only when the grant is released.
	   Several schools in Terengganu, having anticipated the delay, had
cut expenditure, including water and electricity usage.
	   A headmaster in a Kuala Terengganu school said it had been
cautioned to be thrifty.
	   A secondary school teacher in Seberang Takir near Kuala
Terengganu said as spending had been cut, his school had not had
problems paying its bills.
	   Ipoh schools had received their grants, state education director
Datuk Khairuddin Arshad said, and there had been no complaints
despite the delay.
	   Most Penang schools also received their grants last month, said
National Union of Teaching Profession Penang branch secretary Abdul
Karim Abdul Majid.
	   Almost all Kelantan schools too have received their annual
grants since April, said the education department director Datuk
Zorkarnain Abdul Rahman. The remaining five per cent had faced
delays due to ``technical matters''.
	   He said while the department had not received reports from
schools facing financial problems, he advised them to cut down on
activities if they do not have sufficient funds.

Swedish, Finnish forestry products groups to merge into world's largest 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with merger plans confirmed
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish forestry group Stora said
Tuesday it plans to merge with Finnish forestry company Enso,
creating the world's largest producer of paper and board.
	   ``The merger is based on the excellent strategic fit between
these two strong companies, creating a global player in an
increasingly competitive industry,'' said Claes Dahlbaeck, chairman
of Stora. Dahlbaeck will become chairman of the new company, to be
called Stora Enso.
	   Stora and Enso together had about 90 billion kronor (dlrs 11.7
billion) in sales in 1997. Each employs about 20,000 people.
	   The merger will save 1.9 billion kronor (dlrs 2550 million) per
year in operating costs, Stora said.
	   The new group will be number one or two in each of its core
markets, analysts said. Both companies concentrate on fine paper,
publications papers and packaging board. The new company's
negotiating power will work against the violent prices swings that
afflict sections of these markets.
	   ``The merger will help stabilize prices; it will make prices
less volatile,'' said Christian Grellety Bosviel, European pulp and
paper analyst at SG Securities in London.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria coach Hristo Bonev dealt soccer
fans a surprise on Tuesday, when he announced the soccer squad
would be going to the World Cup without playmaker Yordan Lechkov.
	   Bonev said that he had also dropped the third goalkeeper,
Radostin Stanev, and midfielder Kostadin Vidolov.
	   The goalie was dropped after first choice Borislav Mihailov _
one of the heroes at the previous World Cup _ recovered from an
injury.
	   Lechkov had contributed greatly to the team's fourth place at
World Cup 1994. Bonev did not say why he was dropped.
	   The coach announced the 22-man roster after the team returned
from preparations in Germany. They included a friendly with
Germany's champion Kaiserslautern on Monday, which Bulgaria won
4-0.
	   Bulgaria's final roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Borislav Mihailov, Zdravko Zdravkov;
	   Defenders: Radostin Kishishev, Trifon Ivanov, Gosho Ginchev,
Ivailo Petkov, Adalbert Zafirov, Rosen Kirilov, Milen Petkov;
	   Midfielders: Ivailo Yordanov, Zlatko Yankov, Anatoli Nankov,

Driver confesses in Gucci slaying, says real killer still at large

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The man who drove the getaway car in the
slaying of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci confessed Tuesday, but said
the real killer is still at large.
	   In dramatic courtroom testimony, Orazio Cicala said he was drawn
into the murder plot by Gucci's ex-wife, a high-society psychic and
a hotel doorman.
	   Then he dropped a bombshell by saying the accused trigger man is
innocent and the real gunman is still at large.
	   Cicala described the killer as a ``dolt'' he'd met when he was
dealing drugs, but said he was afraid to reveal his identity. ``I
can't give you his name because I have children and a family,'' he
told the court.
	   For the first time, all five defendants appeared at the trial:
Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, her longtime
confident and spiritual adviser Giuseppina Auriemma, Milan hotel
doorman Ivano Savioni and alleged trigger man Benedetto Ceraulo.
	   Gucci was shot dead March 27, 1995, as he walked into his office
building in downtown Milan. When his ex-wife was arrested in
January 1997, prosecutors alleged she had Gucci murdered because
he'd halved her alimony to dlrs 900,000 a year.
	   Reggiani Martinelli's lawyers said in opening arguments that she
hated Gucci and often said she'd like to see him dead. But they
said a 1992 brain tumor operation had rendered incapable of
conceiving and carrying out the murder scheme.
	   They called it ``a psychological short-circuit'' that destroyed
her ``capacity for rational judgment.''

London Club, Kenya Sign Pact On dlrs 70M Debt Rescheduling 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The London Club of commercial creditors and Kenya
signed an agreement on a dlrs 70 million debt rescheduling, Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP) said Tuesday.
	   The signature formalizes a preliminary agreement reached Feb.
13, 1998, which was left unchanged.
	   In February, BNP, which led the negotiations, said that of the
dlrs 70 million total, dlrs 31.2 million was in past-due interest
from January 1992.
	   Under the plan signed Tuesday, Kenya's principal debt will be
restructured into 10-year bonds, with a three-year grace period.
That new bond will pay fixed interest of 3.5 percent, for the first
four and one-half years and will pay the London interbank offered
rate (Libor) plus 13/16 percent thereafter.
	   Two-thirds of the overdue interest will be forgiven and of the
remaining portion, 60 percent will be capitalized, or lumped into
the principal.
	   The rescheduled credits are all in dollars.

Egypt bans printing English-language newspaper for second time 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, EGYPT (AP) _ The government has banned the publication of
an English-language newspaper a week after revoking a ban that
prevented its printing in Egypt, the publisher said Tuesday.
	   Hisham Qassim, publisher of the Cairo Times, said the owner of
the printing plant that puts out the fortnightly informed him that
he received orders from the Information Ministry not print the
paper.
	   However, an official reached at the ministry said the decision
was not made there, speaking under usual conditions of anonymity.
It was not clear if some other government office might be involved.
	   In April the state-run Investment Authority, which supervises
the duty-free areas, imposed a ban on all publications in the zones
where some 40 magazines and newspapers had been printed.
	   The move came amid a government crackdown on what officials call
``sensationalist reporting'' that hurt Egypt's image. Egypt also
has tightened libel laws and jailed three journalists on libel
charges.
	   Critics said the ban on printing in the duty-free zones would
damage Egypt's image as a rising free-market economy. Most of the
publications involved printed in English and other foreign
languages and were taking advantage of high quality and low prices
in the free zones.
	   On May 20 the government rescinded the ban but said that only
specialized publication could use the free zones and would still
need licenses.
	   The government statement caused confusion, but since then Qassim
had put out the Cairo Times at least once in the free zone. He said
the government provided no reason for the latest ban on the
newspaper's publication.
	   After the initial ban, some publishers in the zones moved their
printing to Cyprus and Lebanon, while continuing to distribute in
Egypt. Under the law, all publications licensed abroad have to pass
censorship.

New commander of Swiss guards appointed 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Acting quickly to replace his slain Swiss
Guard commander, Pope John Paul II named a Swiss army colonel on
Tuesday to head the tiny force.
	   The pope appointed Pius Segmueller, 46, just a month after
predecessor Alois Estermann was fatally shot on May 4 along with
his wife by a disgruntled young guardsman.
	   It took the Vatican seven months to announce Estermann's
appointment. Hours after the announcement, he was shot dead. The
young guardsman killed himself, the Vatican said.
	   ``I'm taking on the post with confidence and hope also to gain
people's confidence in me,'' Segmueller said. He said he had been
approached for the job three days after the killings.
	   He called it a particular honor to be called on at such a
critical time.
	   The pontiff named Lt. Elmar Maeder, an attorney and army
veteran, as second-in-command.
	   Estermann's death, the first murder in the Vatican in 150 years,
grabbed headlines around the world and shook the staid Swiss Guards
to its foundations. In a statement Tuesday, interim commander
Roland Buchs thanked the pope for his ``unwavering trust'' in the
corps.
	   The Vatican said Segmueller is a native of Lucerne with degrees
from the University of Zurich, the Zurich Military Academy and the
General Staff's academy. Maeder, who served in the Swiss Army and
is now a lawyer, is from St. Gallen in the eastern part of
Switzerland. Both are members of the majority German-speaking
community.
	   For five centuries, popes have drawn on Swiss Catholic men to
serve in the 100-member papal army, protecting the pope and, in
modern times, performing ceremonial duties at the Vatican.
	   Segmueller and his wife Therese have a 9-year-old son and
8-year-old daughter.

Wales embroiled in club versus country rugby fight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Wales and British Lions center Allan
Bateman is the latest casualty in a conflict of rugby loyalties.
	   Bateman Tuesday became the 19th player to withdraw from Wales'
six-match tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe, leaving the Welsh in a
similar predicament as the English squad currently touring
Australia.
	   Wales accused English premier division club Richmond of
pressuring Bateman into withdrawing from the tour so he could have
an operation on his nose, meaning he won't miss a game next season.
	   The Welsh Rugby Union said Bateman was fit enough to travel and
could have had surgery following the Test against South Africa on
June 27.
	   Announcing his withdrawal Tuesday, Bateman said his priority was
being fit and prepared for next year's World Cup.
	   ``Matters came to a head between the club and the WRU and, in
the end, I decided I just wasn't prepared for the trip and there
was no way I could go.
	   ``The whole business has been a distraction.''
	   Bateman's absence means Wales will travel with only three of the
eight Lions who helped win a Test series against the Springboks
last summer.

Official: Palestinians must be ready to `confront' for Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians must be willing to take to the
streets to block Israeli settlement activity in east Jerusalem, a
senior Palestinian official said.
	   Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian official in Jerusalem,
said last week's clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police
after a Jewish settler group put up seven tin sheds in the Muslim
Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City showed ``a Palestinian readiness to
confront.''
	   ``This is something we must feed,'' Husseini told The Associated
Press in an interview this week. ``We must continue this process
... Political and diplomatic responses do not get the job done if
there is no movement on the Palestinian street.''
	   On Tuesday, however, Husseini used the diplomatic approach,
taking eight European consul-generals to the site of last week's
scuffles, just inside the Old City's Herod's Gate.
	   Walking through the narrow alleyways of the walled Old City,
diplomats from Britain, France, Belgium, Turkey, Sweden, Germany
and Greece shook sand from their well-polished shoes as they looked
at the site. City workers demolished the unauthorized sheds, but
the settler group, Ateret Cohanim, won the right to maintain a
presence on the plot, which is surrounded by Arab homes.
	   ``This area is in the heart of the Islamic neighborhood and
planting another settlement here only complicates negotiations,''
Husseini told the diplomats.
	   On Tuesday, Israel demolished five Palestinian homes and a
marble factory built without permits in and around Jerusalem.
	   Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian minister of higher education,
said Israel's policy of demolishing homes and confiscating land
will lead to violence not only with Palestinians, but with the
Arab, Muslim and Christian world.
	   ``Israel is busy destroying any possible of peace or
coexistence,'' she said.
	   The dispute over Jerusalem is the most explosive issue of the
Israel-Palestinian peace process. Palestinians want east Jerusalem,
which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed, as a capital for
their future state. Israel insists the entire city must remain
under Israeli sovereignty.
	   Husseini said Palestinian committees are studying ways to make
Jerusalem a capital of two states.
	   He said the Palestinian position is that east Jerusalem is
occupied territory and not up for negotiation. Any negotiations on
Jerusalem should be over Arab property in the western sector of the
city, he said.

Annan envoy sees opportunities for rebuilding Sierra Leone 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite continued fighting in Sierra
Leone, a senior U.N. envoy said Tuesday enough stability has
returned to justify a major international effort to rehabilitate
west African country.
	   But Olara Otunnu, who returned this week from a four-day visit
to Sierra Leone, said if the international community waits until
there is ``perfect peace... there's a real danger that the restored
democracy ... will be seriously jeopardized.''
	   Fighters loyal to the deposed military junta have been accused
of massive terror in rural areas in an apparent campaign of revenge
for their ouster in February by Nigerian-led West African troops,
who restored a democratically elected government.
	   Nevertheless, Otunnu said that ``contrary to the impression one
may get from outside,'' the government and the West African
peacekeeping force control enough of the country ``to allow for
very serious programs of rehabilitation and reconstruction.''
	   ``It is possible with concerted, prompt action, jointly by the
national government and the international community, to turn a
page,'' said Otunnu, U.N. special representative for children in
armed conflict.
	   Otunnu said one of the major advantages Sierra Leone enjoys over
other countries emerging from civil conflict is the widespread
support enjoyed by its newly restored government, headed by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Otunnu said Kabbah's political legitimacy would make it easier
for the United Nations to mount an effective humanitarian
rehabilitation program in partnership with the local authorities.
	   He said the government was committed to foreswear recruiting
youngsters into the ranks of the Kamajors, the paramilitary force
allied with Kabbah. Otunnu said the Kamajors had also agreed to
begin discharging ``child soldiers'' already in their ranks.
	   In addition, he said the government had agreed to protect
``child soldiers'' of the deposed junta and its allies in the
Revolutionary United Front, still holding out in rural areas.
	   Last month, the United States and the European Union accused
rebel forces
	   in Sierra Leone of engaging in ``horrific'' violence that has
killed or maimed several thousand people in recent months.
	   They said hundreds of people are being treated in hospitals
after rebels chopped off their arms, legs and ears with machetes.
Many women and children have been systemtically raped, U.S. and EU
officials have alleged.
	   Otunnu said he visited one hospital in the capital Freetown
which had received more than 300 people who had lost limbs and
hands.
	   ``I will never forget the words of a young boy, must have been
about 5 years old, who told me after severing his hands, the RUF
soldiers then told him `go tell President Kabbah we are still
here,''' Otunnu said.

Poetry, hymns and thoughts of Princess Diana comforted Kaunda 
</HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda comforted
himself during five months of detention with poetry, Christian
hymns and thoughts of the late Princess Diana.
	   ``I am very moved when people do good things for fellow man,''
said Kaunda of the princess' charity work. ``I've been trying to
write something on Diana.''
	   Kaunda, 74, spoke Tuesday with The Associated Press at his home
on his first day of freedom after the state dropped charges that he
concealed knowledge of plans for a coup attempt last year.
	   After his arrest on Christmas day, Kaunda was held in a
maximum-security prison and then under strict house arrest, with no
telephone and only brief weekly family visits.
	   Kaunda said he passed the time playing hymns on his guitar and
organ, writing poems and memoirs, and watching satellite television
installed by a supporter. He also had plenty of reading material.
	   Kaunda never met the Princess of Wales, who died in a car
accident in Paris last year, but he ``felt greatly touched by
her.''
	   Dressed in a white casual shirt and cotton jacket, and sporting
a long white beard grown during detention, Kaunda received guests
through the day.
	   Outside, soldiers took down the razor wire and packed up their
tents.
	   Kaunda said he met with officials of his United National
Independence Party, the main opposition group, to discuss deep
divisions during his detention. He hoped to convene a party
convention to heal rifts and decide his own future.
	   ``I've got to get back to work,'' he said. ``If the party says
go, I'll be happy to step down, but there is disarray, there is
rubbish at the top and I would not like to leave a weak party
behind.''
	   The High Court in Lusaka on Monday also freed Kaunda's
bodyguard, Moyce Kaulungombe, who faced similar charges that he
knew of a plot by junior military officers to overthrow the
government.
	   In court Monday, 75 soldiers and two politicians pleaded
innocent to treason charges linked to the coup attempt that was
dismantled within hours by government troops.
	   Kaunda led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964. His 27
years of dictatorial socialsit rule were blamed for bankrupting one
of southern Africa's poorest nations.
	   President Frederick Chiluba won the first democratic elections
in 1991, but sought to ban Kaunda from running again in 1996. The
failed coup attempt triggered a declaration of martial law that
opposition parties claimed was an excuse to crack down on
opponents.
	   Earlier this month, Zambia's government said it would set up an
independent commission to investigate allegations that suspected
coup supporters were tortured in jail.
	   Donor countries have demanded coup suspects be treated according
to international humanitarian law and have expressed deep concern
over the torture reports.
	   Kaunda denied reports that charges were dropped because he
promised South African President Nelson Mandela that he would
retire from politics. In Cape Town on Tuesday, Mandela also denied
reports he had passed such assurances on to Chiluba.
	   Mandela, however, said he believed Chiluba had plans that would
make it unnecessary for Kaunda to want to continue in politics.
	   Mandela did not elaborate.

Outgoing president: I'm one of the most threatened men in Colombia 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Ernesto Samper says he's got a
thick dossier of threats against his life _ from drug traffickers,
leftist rebels, paramilitary groups and political foes _ and will
have to leave the country for a few months when his term ends in
August.
	   ``I understand perfectly that when I leave office, I will be one
of the most threatened people in Colombia,'' Samper, 47, said in an
interview with The Associated Press at the presidential palace.
	   He hasn't decided yet where he'll go, perhaps Spain or England,
but ``it won't be the United States, for known reasons.''
	   Washington revoked Samper's tourist visa two years ago,
believing he solicited dlrs 6 million in campaign contributions
from drug traffickers. Samper is scheduled to visit New York on his
diplomatic visa this weekend for the June 8-10 United Nations
summit on drug trafficking.
	   Under Samper, leftist rebels have gained ground, unemployment
has risen to 14.5 percent and Colombia's traditional attractiveness
to foreign investors has diminished. The United States decertified
the country for two straight years as an ally in the war on drugs,
isolating Samper politically and helping to weaken central
authority.
	   Meanwhile, the Colombian leader more than doubled internal
public debt in what critics called his purchase of political
support from the Congress that acquitted him in June 1996 of drug
corruption charges.
	   ``Colombia is not an easy country to govern, it's a country with
a lot of troubles,'' Samper said Monday during his interview. ``I
was absolutely conscious I was entering a difficult ring with a mad
bull. What I didn't know is that there would be six bulls.''
	   Business leaders, the Roman Catholic church and hundreds of
thousands of Colombians clamored for Samper to resign early in his
term. He refused.
	   ``I decided I preferred not to go into history as the president
toppled by drug-trafficking, but as the president who helped
control and destroy drug trafficking,'' he said. ``Never before has
a president done so much in the fight against drug trafficking.''
	   Laws enacted under Samper stiffened prison terms for drug lords
and made it easier for the state to seize their assets. Congress
also amended the constitution to restore extradition. However, the
law cannot be applied retroactively against drug bosses already
convicted, such as Cali cartel leaders Gilberto and Miguel
Rodriguez, who contributed to the Samper campaign.
	   Many Colombian analysts argued U.S. pressure prompted Samper's
achievements in the war on drugs.
	   But Samper said the United States' ``satanization'' of Colombia
``made governing more difficult.''
	   The president's hand-picked successor, former interior minister,
Horacio Serpa, narrowly won the first-round of presidential
election recently. But polls indicate Conservative Party candidate,
Andres Pastrana, will win the June 21 runoff with support from
voters deeply disillusioned with Samper's legacy.
	   It was Pastrana who first exposed the drug money in Samper's
1994 campaign, one day after Samper narrowly defeated him in the
election.
	   Asked to comment on Pastrana's assertion Friday that his
presidency was the most corrupt in Colombia's history, Samper said
the constitution barred him from answering election-related
questions while still in office.
	   ``On Aug. 8 I can deal with all these considerations, and I
assure you as well that I am dying to answer.''

Wine association wants tough punishment against cheating producer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHE HUTTEAU
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Bordeaux wineries aiming to defend their
reputation urged authorities Tuesday to come down hard on two
colleagues accused of committing the trade's ultimate crime: adding
water, among other things.
	   The wineries' association, ``concerned with protection of
consumers and the reputation of all Bordeaux wine producers,'' said
it wanted authorities to ``draw all the consequences'' from its
investigation.
	   The statement came a day after judicial sources confirmed
finding water, sugar and inferior wines in Chateau-Giscours. The
Margaux is one of the most noted ``grand cru'' wines of the Medoc
region.
	   The wine council, called the CIVB, said in the statement that it
will ``follow this affair very closely and take all the measures it
feels necessary to accomplish its mission.'' It did not elaborate.
	   Placed under investigation for illicit practices _ one step
short of being charged _ are Chateau-Giscours wine expert Regis
Froitefond and the winery's former director Jean-Marie Ferrandez,
the judicial sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Dutch billionaire businessman Eric Albada-Jeigersma, who has
bought part of the domain, was questioned in the investigation, Le
Monde reported.
	   The Bordeaux prosecutor's office opened its investigation in
1995 after complaints by a government office that oversees
competition and fraud complained. Acting on information from a
former employee, the office discovered a mixture of vintages and
inferior wines, the judicial sources said.
	   Water and sugar were also allegedly added to some vats, the
sources said. The newspaper Le Monde reported that milk and certain
acids were likewise detected.
	   None of the additives makes the wine dangerous for the consumer,
the sources said, but they could ruin the chateau, disparage the
Margaux wines and there was speculation it could even shake up the
rising Bordeaux wine prices.

Extradited financier Rey arrives in Switzerland 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES Bahamas-Switzerland-Financier
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ More than six years after he fled, a
Swiss financier wanted on charges of embezzlement arrived in his
home country Tuesday after being extradited from the Bahamas.
	   Werner Rey landed in Zurich on board a charter jet and was
driven to the capital, Bern, where he was taken into custody.
	   Rey, 54, spent more than two years in a prison cell in the
Bahamas. In April, he lost his final appeal against extradition
before the Privy Council of London, the supreme court for several
former British colonies.
	   The Swiss government claims Rey defrauded European investors of
more than dlrs 1 billion and left dlrs 2.8 billion in public and
private debt when his business empire collapsed in 1991.
	   Rey, who denies any wrongdoing, made his money in a takeover of
Bally, a Swiss shoe manufacturer. He used heavily leveraged deals
in the 1980s to build up his main company, Omni Holding AG.
	   In 1992, the Swiss government charged Rey with fraudulent
bankruptcy, business fraud, falsification of accounts and other
felonies.
	   He and his wife, Bernadette Gately, fled Switzerland for the
Bahamas in 1991 and became a permanent residents of the country in
1992. He was arrested in March 1996 and had since been held in a
Nassau prison cell while his lawyers fought to keep him in the
Bahamas.
	   Rey could face a jail sentence of up to 15 years if found
guilty. His trial is expected to begin next year.
	   A decision on Rey's preventive detention will be taken
Wednesday, Bern investigating judge Joerg Roesler told a news
conference.
	   The financier's brother-in-law, Thomas Gately, also wanted in
connection with the case, was arrested in Scotland earlier Tuesday,
Roesler added.

Russia says NATO can't act in Albania without U.N. approval 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia said Tuesday that NATO cannot send troops
to Albanian without the approval of the United Nations.
	   Russia ``opposes any decisions leading to the use of external
forces interfering in those problems,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin said, referring to renewed fighting involving
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for southern Serbia's Kosovo
region.
	   NATO ordered its military planners last week to consider
possible troop deployments in Albania and Macedonia if increased
allied assistance to those nations fails to prevent the violence in
Kosovo from spilling into a wider Balkan conflict.
	   ``Common sense will make (NATO members) act especially
cautiously in that problem-infested region,'' Nesterushkin said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Nesterushkin said Russia does not want NATO forces deployed
without approval from the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is
a permanent member.
	   NATO ambassadors are scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss the
matter, followed by defense ministers on Thursday and Friday, said
a NATO official in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia believes the Kosovo is an internal matter for Serbia, a
fellow Slav nation that makes up the bulk of the former Yugoslavia.
It supports the idea of greater autonomy for Kosovo, while keeping
it part of Serbia.

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for apartheid's last
hard-line president said Tuesday that they would oppose plans to
call one of the apartheid state's most feared assassins for a
courtroom showdown.
	   P.W. Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating apartheid-era
human rights abuses. But the trial has become a probe into whether
Botha's government sanctioned the murders of black activists.
	   To establish why it wants to question Botha, the Truth
Commission has produced documents suggesting that the State
Security Council, which the former president headed, authorized the
killings of black liberation fighters.
	   The prosecution has subpoenaed Eugene de Kock, a former police
colonel and death squad boss, to give evidence against Botha.
However, prosecutors were unsure Tuesday if they would him into
court.
	   ``We are deeply concerned about this,'' Botha's lawyer Lappe
Laubscher said.

Extradited financier Rey arrives in Switzerland

Eds: INCORPORATES Bahamas-Switzerland-Financier
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ More than six years after he fled, a
Swiss financier wanted on charges of embezzlement arrived in his
home country Tuesday after being extradited from the Bahamas.
	   Werner Rey landed in Zurich on board a charter jet and was
driven to the capital, Bern, where he was taken into custody.
	   Rey, 54, spent more than two years in a prison cell in the
Bahamas. In April, he lost his final appeal against extradition
before the Privy Council of London, the supreme court for several
former British colonies.
	   The Swiss government claims Rey defrauded European investors of
more than dlrs 1 billion and left dlrs 2.8 billion in public and
private debt when his business empire collapsed in 1991.
	   Rey, who denies any wrongdoing, made his money in a takeover of
Bally, a Swiss shoe manufacturer. He used heavily leveraged deals
in the 1980s to build up his main company, Omni Holding AG.
	   In 1992, the Swiss government charged Rey with fraudulent
bankruptcy, business fraud, falsification of accounts and other
felonies.
	   He and his wife, Bernadette Gately, fled Switzerland for the
Bahamas in 1991 and became a permanent residents of the country in
1992. He was arrested in March 1996 and had since been held in a
Nassau prison cell while his lawyers fought to keep him in the
Bahamas.
	   Rey could face a jail sentence of up to 15 years if found
guilty. His trial is expected to begin next year.
	   A decision on Rey's preventive detention will be taken
Wednesday, Bern investigating judge Joerg Roesler told a news
conference.
	   The financier's brother-in-law, Thomas Gately, also wanted in
connection with the case, was arrested in Scotland earlier Tuesday,
Roesler added.

Hingis eclipses Venus at French Open, men's favorite Rios ousted 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Seles, Rios quotes
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Playing like the champion she is, Martina Hingis
ousted Venus Williams from the French Open Tuesday, ending the
American teenager's run in Paris.
	   But there will be two Americans in the semifinals. Monica Seles,
playing her first tournament since the death of her father, and
Lindsay Davenport both advanced with three-set wins.
	   And Pete Sampras, thousands of miles away, can rest easy:
Marcelo Rios lost a chance to take the world's No. 1 ranking when
Carlos Moya defeated him in four sets.
	   Rios, the No. 3 seed, had been a favorite to take the title
after the early exits of Sampras and No. 2 Petr Korda.
	   ``He played a great match,'' Rios said of Moya. ``I don't think
I played that great today.''
	   Asked about the No. 1 ranking, he replied: ``I wasn't thinking
about it.''
	   Williams, who powered her way through the first four rounds, met
her match in the world's No. 1 player and lost 6-3, 6-4 in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I didn't play as well as I should have,'' Williams said. ``I
made too many errors. These things, I assure you, will be
corrected.''
	   Hingis last year won every Grand Slam event except the French
Open. Now she is two victories from capturing the lone major to
elude her.
	   ``She's raising her game,'' Williams said. ``Everyone else has
to raise theirs, too.''
	   Seles looked like her old winning self during her victory over
Jana Novotna, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Even the grunts were back. Seles
pounded her fist in the air in triumph after breaking Novotna in
the final game.
	   ``I think about my dad every day,'' she said. ``But for me it's
a tennis match, it's a tennis tournament. I'm doing something that
I love to do.'' Karolj Seles died of cancer May 14.
	   Defending champion Iva Majoli went down to No. 2 seed Lindsay
Davenport, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3. Davenport joked that she might be the
most overlooked semifinalist.
	   ``If I was a betting person or a journalist, I would overlook
myself also,'' she said. ``I don't have a tag. I'm just an ordinary
girl playing tennis and having success. That's a boring story.''
	   Moya, a talented Spaniard, was at the top of his all-court game
in his 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Rios. With Moya serving, the
Chilean saved three match points in the final game, including a
lucky net cord. That delighted the vocal Chilean fans, who waved a
big flag whenever he won a point.
	   But Moya fired an ace to set up the fourth match point, and Rios
netted his final shot.
	   In a showdown billed worthy of a final, Hingis used her deft
touch and court sense to wear down Williams. She almost always
seemed in control, never looking off-balance or rushed.
	   Hingis raced to a 3-0 lead, but Williams broke in the fifth game
for 3-2 as the Swiss star twice double-faulted. Hingis then broke
right back for 4-2, and held on to win the set.
	   In the second set, Williams had a chance to break Hingis for
2-0, racking up three break points. But Hingis won five straight
points to take the game.
	   In the crucial game of the set, Hingis broke Williams for 4-3 _
again on two double faults, this time by Williams.
	   Also reaching the semifinals was No. 4 Aranxta Sanchez Vicario.
The two-time champion from Spain lost a tiebreak in the second set
but recovered to beat Patty Schnyder of Switzerland 6-2, 6-7 (5-7),
6-0.
	   But another former champion, Thomas Muster, continued a
disappointing year with a quarterfinal loss to No. 15 Felix
Mantilla of Spain, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. The Austrian's ranking has
dropped this past year from ninth to 22nd.
	   Leading to the headline match, Hingis wasn't ready to call
Williams a true rival.
	   ``Everybody else is trying to make rivalries against me,'' she
said. ``Venus, she won Key Biscayne, but that's not a Grand Slam.
... I'm No. 1, I've won four Grand Slams. I have the
self-confidence.''
	   Williams, seeded eighth at Roland Garros in just her fourth
event on clay, responded diplomatically.
	   ``I think that she's playing good tennis, and she has every
right to say what she wants to,'' Williams said.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A briefcase bomb exploded inside a
government building in eastern Tehran Tuesday, police said. At
least two people were killed and two others were injured, Iranian
media reported.
	   An Iranian opposition group in exile claimed responsibility in a
statement faxed from Iraq to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
But Iranian news reports indicated it was an accident.
	   The different reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   The midmorning blast caused no visible structural damage to the
four-story white marble building housing the Revolutionary
Prosecutor's office and related courts.
	   The office is responsible for catching and trying Iranians
violently opposed to the 1979 Islamic revolution that installed the
clergy's rule.
	   Pictures taken by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
showed one room with a wall caved in and piles of plaster dust.
	   A police official at the scene, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a
briefcase. He did not elaborate.
	   The bombing is a surprise in a city where security is tightly
controlled. The last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago
when two devices went off in a commercial district but caused no
fatalities. The attack remains a mystery.
	   Iran's state-run television and radio only reported an explosion
at the Prosecutor's Office without specifying if it was a bomb. The
reports said two people were killed and two were injured.
	   IRNA, the official news agency, said the blast was caused by
explosives, and indicated that the material was being brought to
the court as evidence in a case under investigation when it went
off accidentally.
	   But in its statement from Iraq, the opposition Mujahedeen Khalq
said its military units detonated the bomb, killing ``scores of
torturers and interrogators.''
	   However, the scene outside the building _ relaxing firemen and
little activity among the police _ appeared to contradict that
claim. The government did not immediately respond.
	   The Mujahedeen also said the building was demolished, which
proved to be untrue. The group has often made exaggerated claims in
the past.
	   It is the largest Iranian opposition group and is committed to
overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force. It is based in
Baghdad, Iraq and its members in Iran have often been targeted by
the Prosecutor's Office.
	   The explosion comes as Iran is gripped by an intensifying power
struggle between the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami
and hard-line opponents who oppose his social and political
reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.

Milosevic gives opponents in Montenegro 100 days. giving Djukanovic party 100 days to make good on promises; trims. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backers of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday challenged his foes in Montenegro to
make good on promises of the good life for voters, giving them 100
days to do so.
	   The moderate reaction to the election victory led by reformist
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic indicated that for now
Milosevic and his Montenegrin proxies would not directly challenge
the poll results.
	   With Djukanovic expected to use the victory to unseat Milosevic,
there had been fears that he would declare the election invalid and
send army troops into Montenegro, the smaller of the two republics
making up Yugoslavia.
	   The new government of Djukanovic supporters ``will be given 100
days to prove it can fulfill promises ... of a better life for
all,'' said Predrag Bulatovic, deputy chairman of Montenegro's
Socialist People's Party.
	   His statement, carried by Tanjug, Yugoslavia's state news
agency, did not spell out what would happen after 100 days.
	   Bulatovic spoke after Milosevic ally Momir Bulatovic _ who lost
the elections _ was summoned to Belgrade for urgent consultations
with the Yugoslav president. The two Bulatovic's are not related.
	   With both Montenegro and larger Serbia having the same number of
seats in Yugoslavia's federal parliament, Djukanovic is believed to
be planning to stack the Yugoslav parliament with supporters. They
can then team up with the Serbian opposition to either unseat
Milosevic or at least weaken his rule.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
Milosevic has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic's presidential victory last October coupled with
Sunday's parliamentary victory of his supporters seriously weakened
Milosevic's grip.
	   Djukanovic said in an interview with the independent Belgrade
Radio Index Tuesday that Milosevic ``will have to accept the new
Montenegrin political reality.''
	   He accused Milosevic of destroying Yugoslavia with his
``arrogant obstinacy'' and said Milosevic ``will have to take the
blame for the collapse of the country which he is running'' if he
continues attempts to subjugate Montenegro.
	   Djukanovic first challenged the Yugoslav power-broker in the
winter of 1996-1997, coming out against Milosevic during massive
protests against his rule.
	   Last fall, the Montenegrin then narrowly beat Momir Bulatovic _
his former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and western Europe, Djukanovic
took office in January.
	   His triumph in Sunday's elections will hand him a majority in
the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament.
	   Djukanovic said in the radio interview that he would insist on
Momir Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic
maneuvered his protege into that office two weeks ago after the
previous premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western
reforms.
	   Djukanovic's aides have suggested that he would seek a
referendum in Montenegro on the republic's secession from
Yugoslavia if Milosevic doesn't replace Bulatovic.

Primo Nebiolo rips `disgrace' of Atlanta Olympics AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Primo Nebiolo is still bitter about the
1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The powerful Italian leader of track and field's world governing
body launched a scathing attack Tuesday on the organizers of the
Centennial Games.
	   Nebiolo called the organization ``disastrous,'' described the
dismantling of the Olympic Stadium as ``shameful'' and complained
that Atlanta officials refused to pay a cent to promote a pre-games
track meet.
	   The president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation
has criticized Atlanta organizers before. But he went further than
ever when speaking with reporters during a meeting of national and
international Olympic officials in Seville.
	   Addressing the problems faced by track and field in the United
States, Nebiolo recalled that the IAAF organized a Grand Prix meet
in Atlanta a few months before the games.
	   ``We did not find any help,'' he said. ``The meeting cost dlrs 2
million and we paid all of it. The organizers of the Olympic Games
of Atlanta did not do anything to offer a coffee, an apperitif
(cocktail), a little reception, a sandwich. How is this possible?''
	   Nebiolo said he was especially angry that, after the games, the
Olympic stadium was retrofitted into a baseball park for the
Atlanta Braves.
	   ``After the games, they spent $260 million from the Olympic
revenues when we (the IAAF) received practically nothing. They have
destroyed the stadium and built a new stadium in the name of Ted
Turner. It is shameful.
	   ``They also promised us to maintain a good stadium for 25,000
spectators. This disappeared also. This is shameful. It is not
possible to spend money coming from the Olympic revenues in this
manner.''
	   Nebiolo said he wasn't blaming any person in particular, only
pointing out ``a disaster in the organization and a strange use of
the money.''
	   Citing the transportation problems which marred the games,
Nebiolo recounted his own experience of taking a bus from the
stadium after the opening ceremony.
	   ``The bus left for the hotel one hour after the ceremony,'' he
said. ``After 1 kilometer, the bus stopped and the engine was
burning. We were 20-25 people on the bus and we said to the driver,
`What do we do? Do we have to push?' The driver said, `I don't
know. You can push, but I don't know which way to go. I am from New
York.'''
	   Meanwhile, Nebiolo reiterated that the IAAF is offering to help
build up track and field in the United States, where the sport has
suffered from lack of promotion and public interest, and he
encouraged Stanford's bid to stage the 2001 World Championships.
	   ``Personally I would like to have the World Championships in the
United States once in my lifetime,'' he said. ``I believe the U.S.
deserves to have the championships for all that it has offered to
track and field.''
	   ``It is a good bid from Stanford,'' Nebiolo said. ``We are
trying to help them.''
	   Stanford was unsuccessful in its bid for the 1999 championships,
which went to Seville. About half a dozen cities are bidding for
the 2001 meet, which will be awarded by the IAAF in November.
	   Nebiolo noted that President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, is
attending Stanford and that the president himself ``is expressing a
certain sympathy for the idea.''
	   On other issues, Nebiolo:
	   _ expressed satisfaction with preparations for the 1999 World
Championships in Seville and said construction of the new stadium
should be completed in April or May of next year.
	   _ said the Golden League, a series of six elite European meets
being launched this summer, could be expanded to eight meets next
year, with Paris, Stockholm or a British city added. The series
could be increased to 10 meets in 2000 with additional competitions
in the United States and Japan.
	   _ dismissed the possibility of throwing out all track and field
world records and starting from scratch in 2000 because of
suspicions that some records were tainted by suspected drug use.
``The idea can attract interest but, practically, is not
possible,'' he said.
	   _ supported proposals to expand the International Olympic
Committee executive board to include himself as well as
representatives of national Olympic committees and the athletes.

Former top official incriminates old bosses in kidnapping trial 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHANNA TUCKMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former top interior ministry official
testified Tuesday that he was within the inner government circle
that created a shadowy paramilitary unit to combat Basque
separatists in southern France.
	   Julian Sancristobal is among 12 defendants _ including
ex-Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo and his number two Rafael
Vera _ on trial for the 1983 kidnapping of a French businessman who
was mistaken for a hitman from the Basque separatist group ETA.
	   The abduction of Segundo Marey was the first action claimed by
the so-called Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, that went
on to kill 27 suspected members and sympathizers of ETA in southern
France between 1983 and 1987.
	   During four hours of questioning, Sancristobal told the Supreme
Court that Vera gave him a suitcase containing one million French
francs (worth approximately dlrs 130,000 at the time) to cover the
cost of kidnapping Marey _ including hiring mercenaries to carry it
out.
	   He insisted that the whole operation was authorized by
Barrionuevo.
	   Sancristobal's testimony bodes ill for his two former bosses and
fellow defendants in the Supreme Court trial.
	   Both Barrionuevo and Vera are expected to deny involvement in
the kidnapping, as well as the GAL, when they take the stand on
Wednesday at the end of the second week of the trial that is
expected to last over one month.
	   The other accused have already testified on previous days that
the responsibility for the kidnapping belongs to the upper echelons
of the interior ministry, but Sancristobal's version includes a
first hand account that the decisions were made within the
government.
	   Allegations that former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
government set up and ran the GAL were instrumental in the defeat
of his Socialist Party in 1996, after nearly 14 years in office.
	   On Monday a former Socialist Party deputy from the Basque
region, Ricardo Damborenea, said the green light for the GAL was
given directly by Gonzalez.
	   Gonzalez, who is not accused but is to testify, has insisted
that his government never acted illegally in its fight against ETA
_ an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom _ that began its
violent campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.
	   The former premier has also claimed that the trial is a
political conspiracy that is highly damaging to the national
interest.
	   Prosecutors are seeking 23-year jail sentences for Barrionuevo
and Vera, 22 for Sancristobal, 16 for Damborenea and a total of 104
years shared out between the remaining eight defendants.

German court awards damages to inmate forced to work by Nazis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, German (AP) _ A court awarded reparations Tuesday to a
Jewish concentration camp inmate forced by the Nazis to work as a
city laborer and who was unable to apply for postwar government
compensation.
	   The court rejected back-wage claims of two other Jewish inmates
of the Auschwitz camp, saying they already have been receiving
government pensions aimed at compensating them for their
imprisonment and health damage.
	   The first plaintiff, referred to in court only as Mrs.
Rosenberg, lived behind the Iron Curtain after World War II and was
unable to receive any compensation from then-West Germany. She can
therefore claim compensation now, the Bremen state court ruled.
	   She was awarded a lump sum of 15,000 marks (dlrs 8,300),
two-thirds of it for her time spent as slave laborer for the city
of Bremen and one third for health damage.
	   The verdict was similar to a Bonn court ruling in October for
Auschwitz inmates who were forced to work at a munitions factory.
	   That court denied back-wage claims of 21 Jewish women who had
already received postwar government compensation. But it awarded
15,000 marks to a Jewish woman who had lived in Poland after the
war.

Israeli legislature votes to dismantle shrine at gunman's grave 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's legislature voted Wednesday to
dismantle the makeshift shrine that has sprung up at the grave of
an Israeli gunman who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers.
	   In the attack four years ago in the West Bank town of Hebron,
Brooklyn-born Baruch Goldstein opened fire with an automatic rifle
on Muslim worshippers kneeling in prayer in the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, a site sacred to Muslims as well as Jews.
	   The makeshift shrine that has sprung up around Goldstein's
well-tended grave in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, just
outside Hebron, has become a point of pilgrimage for Jewish
extremists.
	   ``What we have today is a memorial and not just a grave,'' said
Ran Cohen, the opposition lawmaker who introduced the bill to take
down the shrine.
	   Objects to be removed include a cabinet containing a Torah, a
case of religious books, and benches and lamps. The grave itself
will not be moved.
	   Cohen said that if the grave continues to be a focus of
pilgrimage, he will introduce a new bill calling for the removal of
the grave itself.

Racketless, coachless in Paris 
</HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When the strings popped in the middle of his junior
match, Russia's Artem Derepasko found himself on court with only
one other racket.
	   Since the rules do not allow players to leave court, except for
bathroom breaks, the chair umpire told Derepasko to ask his coach
to bring a few more rackets to court.
	   But Derepasko said he doesn't have a coach.
	   ``I travel alone, I don't have a coach and my only friend here
is Marat Safin,'' he told the umpire.
	   Safin _ the upstart Russian who ousted defending champion
Gustavo Kuerten _ was otherwise engaged, battling Cedric Pioline on
center court for a berth in the quarterfinals.
	   A ball boy bailed out the young Derepasko with a freshly-strung
racket, and he went on to win the match.
	     ___  
	   PRIDE OF BELGIUM: The only player in the men's draw to reach the
quarterfinals at the French Open without losing a single set almost
pulled out of the tournament with a sore back before swinging a
racket.
	   Belgium's Filip Dewulf _ who made the semifinals here last year
_ hurt his lower back on the eve of his first-round match against
Sweden's Magnus Larsson.
	   Dewulf's strong play here has been all the more surprising given
his record this year of 10 wins and 11 losses.
	   He's won five tiebreakers on his route to the quarters, beating
Spain's Francisco Clavet, Marzio Martelli of Italy and Thomas
Enqvist and Larsson of Sweden.
	   Dewulf, 26, came to Paris with another monkey on his back:
pressure from his national media to pull off a repeat performance
here.
	   He has sparked greater interest in tennis in Belgium, and led a
team that beat France in a playoff match to reach the main group in
Davis Cup play.
	   Since then, Belgium has beaten a powerful Dutch squad and will
now face the United States in a Davis Cup quarterfinal in July.
  ---  
	   CHANG'S POLITESSE: Michael Chang never fails to amaze the
personnel at Roland Garros. This year it's his manners.
	   Following his loss to Spain's Franciso Clavet, Chang waited for
the ball girls and boys to finish collecting the balls, and then
thanked each one individually for working his match.
	   ``He's the only player who ever thanked us for every ball and
every bottle of water,'' said Caroline, a head ball girl on center
court.
  ---  
	   HOMETOWN HERO: Hometown hero Cedric Pioline may lack the
charisma of former French Open champion Yannick Noah, but a record
9 million TV viewers in France tuned in Monday for his match point
against Russia's Marat Safin.
	   Pioline, who's reached the quarterfinals, is the nation's best
shot for the title, which Noah won in 1983.
	   Noah was the last Frenchman to do so since Marcel Bernard won in
1947.

Police chase and beat students protesting new law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Club-wielding policemen on Tuesday
beat Belgrade students protesting a law that gives the government
full control of Serbian universities, media reported.
	   After rallying in front of the rector's office for the 14th
consecutive day, the students decided to march downtown to the
government building but were stopped by a police cordon in the main
pedestrian mall.
	   A smaller group of some 50 students bypassed police, finding its
way into a park area close to the government building, when about
20 policemen rushed them and beat them with clubs, Studio B
television reported.
	   Studio B broadcast witness testimonies of the beatings and said
police had taken away their crew's footage of the incident. At
least one student was seen detained by police.
	   Serbian parliament last week passed a law giving the government
full administrative control over the universities, including
appointments of rectors, deans, teaching and administrative staff.
	   The new law triggered the resignation of the Belgrade university
dean and the department of philosophy declared a general strike,
while students vowed to hold daily protests in front of the
rector's office.

	   YEARS of hard work and perseverance finally paid off for 350
students of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants when
they received their scrolls at a graduation ceremony held recently
at a hotel in Seri Kembangan, Selangor.
	   The students, their parents and relatives arrived early at the
Palace of the Golden Horses in the Mines Resort City on the
graduation day.
	   The graduates have successfully completed either all 14 papers
(or less for those who got exemptions) offered by the international
accountancy body.
	   Their eagerness and excitement were clearly visible.
	   Some were hysterical and ecstatic while others were either
nervous about stepping up on stage to receive the recognition or
simply too touched by the whole affair.
	   The parents and relatives too were equally emotional. Proud
mothers were seen hugging and kissing their children.
	   Other students also exchanged hugs and congratulations with
their friends and lecturers.
	   It was indeed a moment the graduates and their families would
cherish especially for those who had performed really well in their
examinations.
	   Even for those who just managed to pass the ACCA papers with
sufficient credits, the ceremony was still an event to remember.
	   Several Malaysians did the nation proud when they emerged tops
at the international level and won several awards.
	   They are Yong Chee Keong who is the ACCA subject world winner
(paper four), Leong Chee Ming who is the subject world winner
(paper nine), Goh Cheoh Weng who is the first world winner for the
certified diploma in accounting and finance, and Goh Siew Ai who is
the certified diploma in accounting and finance subject world
winner (paper one).
	   Others were ACCA Malaysian place winners Lee Wei Ying, Janice
Chin Sue Vei and Chandra Mohan Selappan who were ranked first,
second and third respectively.
	   Goh Cheoh Weng, 33, holds an applied science bachelor's degree
from University Kebangsaan Malaysia and an economic masters degree
from Cambridge University.
	   He opted for the certified diploma in accounting and finance
post-graduate diploma course as it provides the essential practical
management skills which are important sential to him as a senior
executive in a multinational firm.
	   His ingredients for success are not extraordinary.
	   He said one needed discipline, diligence, time management and
perseverance to succeed.
	   Even though, the past one year has been a difficult time
especially when he had to think about work, studies and family all
at the same time, it never occurred to him to quit.
	   ``I spare the weekends and holidays for the family as during
weekdays, apart from attending classes and doing revisions after
work, I needed to focus on my office work as it needed a lot of
after-office attention,'' he said.
	   In his case, although Cheoh Weng only had classes two days in a
week, he took the effort to study and revise for at least an hour
every day.
	   ``I need to keep my mind running. Our brains are like machines
which if we leave it unused for too long, it will rust and would
take some time to be reconditioned,'' he said.
	   On graduation day, he was accompanied by his wife Foong Leng,
who seemed even more excited than Cheoh Weng about the whole
affair.
	   Foong Leng, a housewife, strongly encouraged her husband's
pursuit and provided the moral support while Cheoh Weng was
pursuing his studies.
	   ``I made sure that everything was comfortable for him while he
was concentrating on his studies or revisions,'' she said.
	   She felt that under the circumstances, showing understanding and
tolerance were important.
	   Chandra Mohan Selappan has been working for some months since
the results came out at a consultant company as a finance and
administration executive.
	   He acknowledged that although the working world was not exactly
the same as classroom work and such, the ACCA had provided him with
the necessary knowledge for him to be competitive with others who
were more senior.
	   Chandra Mohan took a bold step forward when he decided to
decline an offer to study accountancy in a local university to
pursue the professional qualification.
	   ``People told me I am crazy to take such risk as I would have to
sit for all the papers again even if I failed only one paper,'' he
said.
	   However, he had no doubt he had made the right choice and his
perseverance and consistency had proven right.
	   ACCA Malaysia president William Arul said the examination was
among the most demanding written assessment in the world and it
required determination, discipline and perseverance from the
students.
	   ``They choose ACCA because it is a high quality qualification
which has worldwide recognition and offers a high degree of career
mobility,'' he said.
	   ``Completion of the ACCA course has equipped them with the
skills and knowledge to excel in their careers.
	   ``However, an accountant can no longer focus only on skills
within the organisation that he works in. Rather, the person needs
to be adaptive to changes in the global environment.''
	   William Arul added that the new generation of accountants should
be more than technically oriented.
	   They need to be effective communicators, persistent motivators
and logical strategists working towards becoming successful
leaders.
	   The presentation of certificates was made by Ministry of Finance
Parliament Secretary Datuk Seri Shafie Mohd Salleh.
	   ACCA is an international professional accountancy body.
	   Established in Britain in 1904, it currently has more than
60,000 members and 130,000 students worldwide in more than 130
countries.
	   In Malaysia, there are 13,000 students, 1,500 graduates and more
than 3,500 registered members.
	   Over the years, its has produced many successful professionals
to serve as chief executives, senior partners, finance directors,
entrepreneurs and high ranking civil servants.

South Africa disputes Nigerian charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The South African government on
Tuesday rebuffed charges by Nigeria that it is plotting with the
United States and Ghana to disrupt upcoming presidential elections.
	   ``Our track-record shows that we would not co-operate with any
non-African country to bring another African government into
disrepute or destabilize it,'' said President Nelson Mandela's
spokesman Parks Mankahlana.
	   He added that Mandela believed the charges were the result of
misunderstanding.
	   ``We hope this is just an electoral trick, which will be
forgotten after the elections,'' Mankahlana said.
	   On Monday, Gen. Sani Abacha's ruling military junta accused the
United States, South Africa and the West African country of Ghana
of meeting recently in Ghana to discuss coordinated opposition to
the August elections.
	   Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, Abacha in
April became the only candidate, rendering the poll into little
more than a referendum on his selection.
	   Abacha seized power in a bloodless 1993 coup and while he has
repeatedly pledged to hand over power to a civilian government, it
now seems that Abacha plans to keep the job for himself.

Pakistan official says Swiss charged three close to Bhutto

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Pakistan's anti-corruption investigator said
Tuesday that a Geneva magistrate indicted three Swiss citizens
linked to former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and was
close to indicting her and her husband.
	   Senator Saif-ur Rehman said he was present Tuesday when Judge
Daniel Devaud announced the indictments on money laundering
charges.
	   ``Judge Devaud has confirmed his intention of proceeding with
the indictment of Mr. Asif Ali Zardari (Ms. Bhutto's husband),''
Rehman said at a news conference.
	   Bhutto was dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule, which she claims are concocted by political opponents.
Zardari, widely blamed for his wife's downfall, has been jailed
since her dismissal.
	   Devaud also intends to indict Ms. Bhutto if he determines she
cannot receive immunity, Rehman said. Devaud expects to know within
a week, he said.
	   Repeated attempts to reach Devaud by telephone were
unsuccessful.
	   Indicted Tuesday was Hans J. Fischer, former senior executive
vice-president at Geneva-based Societe Generale de Surveillance SA,
where he was responsible for the company's government contracts
division.
	   The other two indicted were Robert Massey, managing director for
SGS former subsidiary, Cotecna Inspection SA; and Jens
Schlegelmilch, whom Rehman described as a Geneva lawyer who served
as Ms. Bhutto's and her husband's agent in handling financial
transactions.
	   Elisabeth Salina Amorini, chairman of SGS's board, said Fischer
stepped down last year to aid the investigation. Schlegelmich
declined to comment. Recorded messages left for Massey and Fischer
were not immediately answered.
	   Rehman said the Swiss conducted the investigation at the request
of the Pakistani government.
	   Rehman showed reporters documents he gave Devaud, saying they
indicated kickbacks flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands from Pakistani
government contracts with SGS and Cotecna.
	   SGS, parent of the world's largest inspection services group,
and Cotecna lost their contracts to inspect imports and exports
from Pakistan after Ms. Bhutto was ousted from government.
	   Rehman said he does not know the full scope of Devaud's case,
but he believes more than dlrs 250 million are in Bhutto family
accounts in Swiss banks, which the Swiss government has blocked at
Pakistan's request.
	   Swiss authorities said last October that they had found about 20
million Swiss francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts frozen in
seven Geneva banks.

	   LACK of interest among the younger generations of the Victoria
Institution ex-students in becoming members of the Old Boys'
Association was the main issue brought up during its recent annual
meeting recently.
	   The association formed 76 years ago is currently made up of
mostly ``not- so-young'' members.
	   Association president Datuk Mustafa Mohd Ali when responding to
this issue said three years ago he had distributed about 250
application forms to school leavers to enable them to join the
association as honorary members but sadly, none of the forms came
back.
	   The association, he said, had many times sent circulars to the
prospective school leavers and only five per cent applied to be
members.
	   Mustafa, however, understood why there was such a poor response.
	   ``Most of the school leavers will be too occupied with
establishing themselves with careers or settling down in the first
10 years after leaving school as in my case,'' he said.
	   ``However, I believe that the problem of lack of membership from
the younger generations of ex-scholars can slowly be solved with
networking.''
	   With networking, Mustafa meant a member-get-member system.
	   ``If a member knows of any ex-scholars who are non-members, he
should try to get them to join the association,'' he suggested.
	   If an ex-scholar wants to join the alumni, he is advised to
apply as a life member and not just an ordinary member.
	   An ordinary member has to pay RM24 a year for membership while a
life member only need to pay RM300 for life-long membership.
	   ``It will be easier for the alumni to keep track of life members
as we will be sending them from time to time the association's
bulletin and they can always contact us if they change addresses,''
he said.
	   Since a life member is required to pay the subscripiton in one
lump sum, Mustafa said this would encourage them to be more active
in the association's activities.
	   A bigger membership means more income for the association which
means more activities can be planned and carried out.
	   For the association, this means more money can be channelled to
its alma mater and the existing students through the VIOBA
Foundation.
	   Other than efforts by the association to attract members, member
Chung Chee Min has also on his own been compiling names of
ex-scholars of VI since two months ago.
	   He said this compilation, which will be made into a book, would
not be just an ordinary alumni directory as he had so far
interviewed some prominent ex-students such as Jimmy Talalla of the
Talalla brothers, both of whom had fought in the World War II,
former Bank Negara Governor Tun Ismail Ali, Tun Omar Ong and New
Straits Times cartoonist Ahmad Fauzi Zainal Abidin.
	   ``The interview with them will be compiled in the book and it
would be an exciting read for students as well as ex-students,'' he
said.
	   He added that there was a homepage, started by a few Old Boys,
consisting of interesting stories on VI, the teachers and the old
boys.
	   The Internet site is frequently updated.
	   Those interested can check out the website at
www.mol.com.my/yellowpg/personal/vi/vihome.htm VIOBA is located at
71, Jalan Hang Tuah, 55200 Kuala Lumpur and can be reached at

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Bank Negara Governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don
said there was still a lot of confidence in the economy, with the
current account deficit, which used to be around five per cent of
Gross National Product, now ``close to balance''.
	   He was confident the current account would show a significant
improvement in the second half of the year.
	   On the Islamic banking system, he said the Syariah Council had
decided to allow financial institutions offering interest-free
products and instruments to shift towards free-float money market
instruments instead of a fixed peg.
	   This shift, to be done within two months, would enable Islamic
banking institutions to compete with conventional banks.
	   On factors that would affect Malaysia's economic recovery, Ahmad
said it hinged on export growth, financial institutions being able
to lend within their credit plan, a commitment to implement
macro-economic adjustment package, stable exchange rates and a
growth in investments.
	   ``One favourable factor is that world demand is there. Output is
forecast to grow at 3.1 per cent while trade will go up 6.7 per
cent. Malaysian firms are still competitive and long-term
investments are still positive,''
	   he said.
	   ``The central bank will ensure there is sufficient liquidity
within the system to finance the economy. Measures have been taken
to ensure banks focus on lending. The latest step is the
establishment of the Asset Management Company.
	   ``Recovery also hinges on economic and financial measures being
implemented as announced,'' he added, adding that the ringgit had
been relatively stable although it was still vulnerable.
	   He admitted that the tight monetary policy resulted in some
banks having problems in funding economic activities but overall
there were more repayments than disbursements in the first quarter.
	   Loans growth will pick up in the second half with the various
funds and Government-inspired schemes coming onstream.
	   On non-performing loans, Ahmad said its ratio to total loans was
7.6 per cent for commercial banks, 13.5 per cent for finance
companies and 7.9 per cent for merchant banks.
	   On a net basis, meaning without including interest-in-suspense
and specific provisions, the ratio dropped to 5.8 per cent for
commercial banks, 10.5 per cent for finance companies and 5.2 per
cent for merchant banks.
	   Ahmad said that this was the result of the latest ``stress
test'' the central bank put on financial institutions.
	   Interestingly, Ahmad volunteered the information that if the
non-performing loans ratio of two commercial banks were excluded,
it would improve the overall ratio of commercial banks to 4.8 per
cent. As expected, he declined to name the two banks, adding that
the Press was ``perceptive'' enough to know which two.
	   Ahmad was also asked to comment on a warning by Economic Adviser
to the Government Tun Daim Zainuddin that a high-interest regime
coupled with tight lending guidelines would send the economy into a
tailspin and put it in danger of a stagflation.
	   He said Daim's advice would be noted by all the implementing
agencies of the Government as he was also executive director of the
National Economic Action Council.
	   ``We receive all comments and criticism with an open mind as we
all work towards stability in the economy and a speedy recovery,''
he said.
	   ``We have no hang-ups that if something is negative, we will put
it away ...,'' he quipped.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The Umno supreme council which meets on
June 8, will discuss the position of Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib
as a vice-president of the party and his eligibility to contest in
next year's council elections.
	   This follows Muhammad's acquittal yesterday on two charges of
falsely declaring the money he took into Australia in December 1996
and failing to declare more than AS$1.2 million (RM2.9 million)
when he left the country.
	   Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today since
Muhammad went on leave as a vice-president following a decision by
the council, the matter would have to be referred to the council
now.
	   The council decided on May 10 last year that Muhammad would
cease to function as Umno vice-president and would not be involved
in the activities of the council pending the outcome of his court
case.
	   Today, the Prime Minister, after opening the 45th MCA general
assembly at Wisma MCA here, was also asked whether Muhammad would
be ordered to declare his assets.
	   Dr Mahathir said: ``By right as Menteri Besar (then), he must
declare his assets to me.''
	   Asked whether he was surprised by the extent of Muhammad's
wealth and whether Muhammad had declared his assets to him, Dr
Mahathir said: ``I think I will not answer it now. Let the supreme
council meet first, after which I will give my answer.''
	   Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim was also asked to
comment on Muhammad's position. Anwar, who just came back from a
working visit to New York and London, said Muhammad's position
would also be discussed by Umno's management and discipline
committee.
	   Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Commonwealth
secretary-general Chief Emeka Anyaoku and Commonwealth Youth
Ministers here, Anwar said the committee's views would then be
presented to the party president and the supreme council.
	   He said the party welcomed the Australian court's decision.
	   In Shah Alam, Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar today
said he was very relieved when he heard that Muhammad had been
acquitted.
	   He said after 18 months waiting for the case to conclude,
Muhammad could now concentrate on his duty as the State Assemblyman
for Batang Kali.
	   On Muhammad's political future, Abu Hassan said that would be up
to the Umno leadership to decide.
	   ``I am very thankful that the case has been concluded and that
Muhammad has been acquitted,'' he said after opening a seminar on
economic problems for Government servants today.
	   Meanwhile, Kelantan Umno deputy liaison chief Datuk Annuar Musa
today said the verdict on Muhammad should be respected by all.
	   Umno Wanita head Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said it would
support the supreme council's decision on Muhammad's political
future.
	   She said since he was found not guilty, he should not be denied
his rights.
	   ``If we follow precedents, he should come back to the
(vice-president's) post ... but it is up to the supreme council to
discuss.''
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayob, who is also Umno supreme council member, said he
was grateful that Muhammad had been acquitted and welcome
Muhammad's active participation in Umno.
	   ``It is up to the council to decide whether to accept Muhammad
or not,''
	   he told reporters after launching a seminar on the ``Role of
Consumers during the Economic Situation''.

Some 46 countries demand India, Pakistan end tests, join treaties

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ From the United States to Malta, 46 countries
Tuesday demanded India and Pakistan immediately stop testing
nuclear arms and join efforts to eliminate the weapons.
	   Islamic countries and some nonnuclear countries expressed
concern about the tests, but they blamed the five nuclear powers _
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States _ for failing
to heed the concerns of India and Pakistan.
	   In an all-day emergency session of the 61-nation Conference on
Disarmament, the nonnuclear countries urged the five powers to drop
their opposition to proposed negotiations to eliminate their atomic
arsenals.
	   India and Pakistan maintain that such talks according to a
``time-bound framework'' would be the only way to address the
security needs of all countries.
	   If the five powers had accepted India's attempts to set up
global nuclear disarmament, ``we need not have gone in for our
current testing program,'' said Indian Ambassador Savitri Kunadi.
	   The nuclear powers maintain that they are eliminating their
arsenals but have to do it among themselves and cannot subject the
complicated topic to global bargaining.
	   The conference, the world's main forum for negotiating
disarmament agreements, wrote the test ban treaty flouted by the
Indian and Pakistani tests.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram welcomed the debate, which said
``widely acknowledged'' that Pakistan was only reacting to ``the
nuclear threat emanating from India.''
	   The five nuclear powers were among the countries that joined in
the joint statement spearheaded by Australia and New Zealand.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' the statement said.
	   India's and Pakistan's tests last month ``blatantly undermine''
attempts to halt nuclear proliferation and threaten to undermine
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons, and belong ``to a bygone
age,'' it said.
	   The statement said it was ``crucial that India and Pakistan
announce immediately a cessation to all further testing of these
weapons, renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and
ratify unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.
	   Iran said it viewed the developments with ``deep concern,'' but
said what is needed is ``an all-encompassing program for
comprehensive nuclear disarmament.''
	   Despite Tehran's denials, Iran is widely believed to be pursuing
its own nuclear-weapons program.
	   On Monday Iran's foreign minister said on a visit to Islamabad
that Muslims welcomed Pakistan's nuclear tests because it gives the
Islamic world a bomb to counter Israel's widely suspected arsenal.
	   South African Ambassador Jacob S. Selebi said it was
``imperative'' that the conference tackle nuclear disarmament.

Arab ministers vow to thwart Israel at Euro-Med meeting

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab nations Tuesday vowed to work toward
preventing Israel from getting economic benefits from Europe as
long as it follows a hard-line stand on the Middle East peace
process.
	   ``The reason for the crisis in the peace process is the current
Israeli government,'' Arab League Secretary General Esmet Abdel
Meguid said.
	   He was speaking at a joint news conference by foreign ministers
of Arab nations who are preparing for the June 3-4
European-Mediterranean conference of foreign ministers in Palermo,
Italy.
	   Israel is participating along with Cyprus, the Palestinian
territory and eight Arab countries from the Mediterranean basin.
The Libyan foreign minister will not attend. Europe will be
represented by 15 members of the European Union.
	   The Arabs fear that Israel will try to persuade Europe to ignore
the faltering Middle East peace process while boosting business
links.
	   But ministers of the Arab participants, who met on Monday and
Tuesday in Beirut to chart a common strategy, have decided to stand
firm against Israel, Lebanon's Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said.
	   The Arab ministers agreed that it was ``impossible to separate
politics from the economy,'' he said.
	   The European Union gives dlrs 2.3 billion in annual aid to the
region, including Israel.
	   Since Israel's hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came
to power two years ago, Arab states have accused him of reneging on
the land-for-peace formula adopted during the U.S.-sponsored 1991
Middle East peace conference in Madrid, Spain.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Married women with children in South Korea
have been made the first target for retrenchment, the 12th
Asia-Pacific Roundtable was told today.
	   Prof Han Sung-Joo, a former Foreign Minister and professor of
political science and director of the Ilmin International Relations
Institute, said the rate of increase in female unemployment in
South Korea was seven times that of male workers in the third
quarter of 1997.
	   ``Simply put, female workers in South Korea get a so-called
`ladies first' consideration when it comes to massive lay-offs,''
Sung-Joo said.
	   He was speaking at a plenary session on ``Currency Turmoil in
Asia: The Strategic Impact''.
	   He said as of February, over 1.23 million workers had lost their
jobs, 30 per cent of them women.
	   In this context, the new Korean Government has established a
special committee representing the interests of women in the
country. The committee is under the supervision of the President.
	   ``Needless to say, any attempts for a government committee to
promote women's interests should be accompanied by an effort to
change the prejudicial attitude towards women,'' said Sung-Joo.
	   At another session, Khun Pisit na Patalung, who is
secretary-general of Wildlife Fund Thailand, said Asean needed to
regard haze as a long-term on-going problem, not a temporary one.
	   He was speaking on ``The Threat From The Haze: What Must Be
Done?''

Canadian sprinter plans to retire after 2000 Olympics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey, the
100-meter world record holder, said Tuesday that he will retire
after the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Before that Bailey hopes to clinch the world title at the 1999
championships in Seville.
	   The 30-year-old Canadian, who traveled to Milan to compete in a
night meet Friday, said he was in questionable form following an
Achilles tendon injury.
	   ``I will try to go under 10 seconds here... I just hope it does
not rain,'' he told reporters.
	   ``I think I'll finish my career with the Sydney Olympics. After
that I'll be finally able to smoke a fat cigar. But until then I
will enjoy beating the Americans,'' Bailey said.
	   The Milan meet, at the local Arena, features Bailey, Kenyan
Daniel Komen in the 2,000 meters and Jamaican sprinter Merlene
Ottey.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The gyroscopes that keep Mir's solar panels facing
the sun were working again Tuesday, the last repair necessary after
a three-day computer failure that threatened to delay a planned
docking with a U.S. shuttle.
	   Mir's main computer was repaired Monday, and the automatic
steering system needed to steady the space station for the docking
with space shuttle Discovery was reactivated soon afterward.
	   On Tuesday, ground controllers switched on Mir's 11 gyroscopes,
the station's preferred, fuel-free orientation system.
	   NASA considered postponing the hookup with Discovery after Mir's
computer broke down Saturday, but the blast off is set for Tuesday
night as planned. It will pick up astronaut Andrew Thomas, the
seventh and last American to live on the Russian space outpost.
	   ``Mir is now running smoothly and nothing prevents the planned
docking with Discovery,'' said Russian Mission Control spokesman
Valery Lyndin.
	   Mir commander Talgat Musabayev agreed: ``With the gyroscopes,
everything seems to be OK, touch wood.''
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply dwindles
since it can't rotate to keep its solar panels in full alignment
with the sun.
	   When the latest trouble occurred, the station was on a so-called
solar orbit, which puts it in direct sunlight around the clock. As
a result, Mir's batteries remained fully charged, making it easier
to reactivate the steering system.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a previous shuttle
flight in January. That unit failed on Saturday after five months
of trouble-free operation.
	   The station's crew has replaced it with a back-up computer
brought up by a Russian cargo ship but the new unit also failed
Sunday when the crew attempted to switch it on.
	   Russia plans to bring down the 12-year-old Mir at the end of
1999 after the first parts of the international space station are
in orbit.

Wine association wants tough punishment against cheating producer

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Bordeaux wineries aiming to defend their
reputation _ and their lofty prices _ urged authorities Tuesday to
come down hard on two colleagues accused of committing the trade's
ultimate crime: adding water, among other things.
	   The wineries' association, ``concerned with protection of
consumers and the reputation of all Bordeaux wine producers,'' said
it wanted authorities to ``take all necessary action'' after its
investigation.
	   The statement came a day after judicial sources confirmed
finding water, sugar and inferior wines in Chateau-Giscours. The
Margaux is one of the most noted ``grand cru'' wines of the Medoc
region.
	   The wine council, called the CIVB, said in the statement that it
will ``follow this affair very closely and take all the measures it
feels necessary to accomplish its mission.'' It did not elaborate.
	   Placed under investigation for illicit practices _ one step
short of being charged _ are Chateau-Giscours wine expert Regis
Froitefond and the winery's former director Jean-Marie Ferrandez,
the judicial sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Dutch billionaire businessman Eric Albada-Jeigersma, who has
bought part of the domain, was questioned in the investigation, Le
Monde reported.
	   The Bordeaux prosecutor's office opened its investigation in
1995 after complaints by a government office that oversees
competition and fraud complained. Acting on information from a
former employee, the office discovered a mixture of vintages and
inferior wines, the judicial sources said.
	   Water and sugar were also allegedly added to some vats, the
sources said. The newspaper Le Monde reported that milk and certain
acids were likewise detected.
	   None of the additives makes the wine dangerous for the consumer,
the sources said, but they could ruin the chateau, disparage the
Margaux wines and there was speculation it could even shake up the
rising Bordeaux wine prices.
	   One French wine expert, Michel Bettane, suggested government
checks on wineries ``are still insufficient. In particular, on
adding tartaric acid.
	   ``It's evident that that fraud is widely practiced all over
France,'' he told LCI television. But Bettane urged the law be
revised, ``because it was made to avoid artificial wine.''
	   Hubert Bouteiller, a spokesman for the CIVB, told LCI that
Bordeaux producers ``are serious people by a very very large
majority.
	   ``You see it in their selections, in how much of the harvest
they reject, to make remarkable wines justifying their price.''

	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
executive board on Tuesday approved new biathlon events and the
addition of two more women's ice hockey teams for the 2002 Winter

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey, the
100-meter world record holder, said Tuesday that he will retire
after the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Before that Bailey hopes to clinch the world title at the 1999
championships in Seville.
	   The 30-year-old Canadian, who traveled to Milan to compete in a
night meet Friday, said he was in questionable form following an
Achilles tendon injury.
	   ``I will try to go under 10 seconds here... I just hope it does
not rain,'' he told reporters.
	   ``I think I'll finish my career with the Sydney Olympics. After
that I'll be finally able to smoke a fat cigar. But until then I
will enjoy beating the Americans,'' Bailey said.
	   The Milan meet features Bailey, Kenyan Daniel Komen in the 2,000

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A briefcase bomb exploded inside a
government building in Tehran on Tuesday, police said. At least two
people were killed and two others were injured, Iranian media
reported.
	   An Iranian opposition group in exile claimed responsibility in a
statement faxed from Iraq to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
But Iranian news reports called it an accident.
	   The different reports could not immediately be reconciled.
	   The midmorning blast caused no visible structural damage to the
four-story white marble building housing the Revolutionary
Prosecutor's office and related courts.
	   The office is responsible for catching and trying Iranians
violently opposed to the 1979 Islamic revolution that installed the
clergy's rule.
	   Pictures taken by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
showed one room with a wall caved in and piles of plaster dust.
	   The bombing is a surprise in a city where security is tight. The
last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago, when two
devices went off in a commercial district but caused no fatalities.
The attack remains unclaimed.
	   A police official at the scene, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said the explosion was caused by a bomb in a
briefcase. He did not elaborate.
	   Iran's state-run television and radio only reported an explosion
at the Prosecutor's Office without saying it was a bomb. The
reports said two people were killed and two were injured.
	   IRNA, the official news agency, said the blast was caused by
explosives, and indicated that the material was being brought to
court as evidence in a case under investigation when it went off
accidentally.
	   But in its statement from Iraq, the opposition Mujahedeen Khalq
said its military units detonated the bomb, killing ``scores of
torturers and interrogators.''
	   However, the scene outside the building _ relaxing firemen and
little activity among the police _ appeared to contradict that
claim. The government did not immediately respond.
	   The Mujahedeen also said the building was demolished, which
proved to be untrue. The group has often made exaggerated claims in
the past.
	   It is the largest Iranian opposition group and is committed to
overthrowing Iran's Islamic government by force. It is based in
Baghdad, Iraq and its members in Iran have often been targeted by
the Prosecutor's Office.
	   The explosion comes as Iran is gripped by an intensifying power
struggle between the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami
and hard-line opponents who oppose his social and political
reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.

	   TO help the poor and needy members of the Jaffnese Co-operative
Society, an education fund of RM108,000 was launched at the Sri
Sithi Vinayagar Temple recently. The T. Kandiah Education Fund was
presented to JCS president P.Vamathevan as a deed of trust by the
only surviving son of Kandiah, K. Shanmuganathan.
	   His grandson Ashok Kandiah said his grandfather loved the
community and would do just about anything to help and support the
poor and needy.
	   He said the fund was something the family wanted to do for a
long time and by setting up a fund under his name, he will leave
behind his legacy.
	   ``The JCS can invest the money in any venture. The capital gains
will be dispersed as study loans to the poor and needy students,''
he said.
	   ``The loan can be paid back after their graduation or when they
are employed. The terms and conditions of the loan will be made
between the education fund committee and the student receiving the
loan.''
	   Only RM38,000 was paid on the day of the launch and RM2,000 will
be paid monthly until the fund reaches RM108,000.
	   Ashok said his grandfather spent a lot of money and time
performing services to benefit the public.
	   He added that his grandfather's motto was ``Service before
Self'' and his service towards the community earned praise and
respect from many people.
	   Kandiah gave financial aid to those who were imprisoned during
the interim period of the Japanese Occupation and sent them to
Ceylon or rehabilitated them in Malaysia.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Michel Platini condemned the Air France pilots'
strike Tuesday as harming the image of France, while the walkout
disrupted the national team's World Cup training.
	   In its second day, the strike at the World Cup's official
airline caused scheduling nightmares for teams preparing for the
soccer championship that begins June 10.
	   Top brass at Air France sat down with striking pilots' unions in
an attempt to keep the World Cup from becoming a no-show event for
thousands of fans.
	   Platini, co-president of the World Cup organizing committee,
accused the pilots of ``taking the country hostage. ... This is the
image of France at stake, not necessarily that of an airline.''
	   Aime Jacquet, coach of the French national team, said the
players had been given a three-day weekend to visit their families
and were supposed to resume training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   At Charles de Gaulle airport, a kiosk displayed newspapers with
headlines reading: ``World Cup held hostage'' and ``World Cup in
peril.''
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts
affecting the airline's 3,200 pilots.
	   The airline is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday, said
it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines, connecting to
an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the Americans have
rented buses in France in case the domestic flight is affected by
the walkout.

Retransmits to fix typo in slug Primo Nebiolo rips `disgrace' of Atlanta Olympics AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Primo Nebiolo is still bitter about the
1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The powerful Italian leader of track and field's world governing
body launched a scathing attack Tuesday on the organizers of the
Centennial Games.
	   Nebiolo called the organization ``disastrous,'' described the
dismantling of the Olympic Stadium as ``shameful'' and complained
that Atlanta officials refused to pay a cent to promote a pre-games
track meet.
	   The president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation
has criticized Atlanta organizers before. But he went further than
ever when speaking with reporters during a meeting of national and
international Olympic officials in Seville.
	   Addressing the problems faced by track and field in the United
States, Nebiolo recalled that the IAAF organized a Grand Prix meet
in Atlanta a few months before the games.
	   ``We did not find any help,'' he said. ``The meeting cost dlrs 2
million and we paid all of it. The organizers of the Olympic Games
of Atlanta did not do anything to offer a coffee, an apperitif
(cocktail), a little reception, a sandwich. How is this possible?''
	   Nebiolo said he was especially angry that, after the games, the
Olympic stadium was retrofitted into a baseball park for the
Atlanta Braves.
	   ``After the games, they spent $260 million from the Olympic
revenues when we (the IAAF) received practically nothing. They have
destroyed the stadium and built a new stadium in the name of Ted
Turner. It is shameful.
	   ``They also promised us to maintain a good stadium for 25,000
spectators. This disappeared also. This is shameful. It is not
possible to spend money coming from the Olympic revenues in this
manner.''
	   Nebiolo said he wasn't blaming any person in particular, only
pointing out ``a disaster in the organization and a strange use of
the money.''
	   Citing the transportation problems which marred the games,
Nebiolo recounted his own experience of taking a bus from the
stadium after the opening ceremony.
	   ``The bus left for the hotel one hour after the ceremony,'' he
said. ``After 1 kilometer, the bus stopped and the engine was
burning. We were 20-25 people on the bus and we said to the driver,
`What do we do? Do we have to push?' The driver said, `I don't
know. You can push, but I don't know which way to go. I am from New
York.'''
	   Meanwhile, Nebiolo reiterated that the IAAF is offering to help
build up track and field in the United States, where the sport has
suffered from lack of promotion and public interest, and he
encouraged Stanford's bid to stage the 2001 World Championships.
	   ``Personally I would like to have the World Championships in the
United States once in my lifetime,'' he said. ``I believe the U.S.
deserves to have the championships for all that it has offered to
track and field.''
	   ``It is a good bid from Stanford,'' Nebiolo said. ``We are
trying to help them.''
	   Stanford was unsuccessful in its bid for the 1999 championships,
which went to Seville. About half a dozen cities are bidding for
the 2001 meet, which will be awarded by the IAAF in November.
	   Nebiolo noted that President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, is
attending Stanford and that the president himself ``is expressing a
certain sympathy for the idea.''
	   On other issues, Nebiolo:
	   _ expressed satisfaction with preparations for the 1999 World
Championships in Seville and said construction of the new stadium
should be completed in April or May of next year.
	   _ said the Golden League, a series of six elite European meets
being launched this summer, could be expanded to eight meets next
year, with Paris, Stockholm or a British city added. The series
could be increased to 10 meets in 2000 with additional competitions
in the United States and Japan.
	   _ dismissed the possibility of throwing out all track and field
world records and starting from scratch in 2000 because of
suspicions that some records were tainted by suspected drug use.
``The idea can attract interest but, practically, is not
possible,'' he said.
	   _ supported proposals to expand the International Olympic
Committee executive board to include himself as well as
representatives of national Olympic committees and the athletes.

	   Q: I AM 34 years old and have been married for four years. I've
been trying to conceive but have not been successful. I had an
operation for endometriosis and fibroids three years ago.
	   I was given fertility pills for four months but they didn't
work.
	   Recently, I saw another gynaecologist and she discovered that my
left fallopian tube was blocked.
	   I was given medication and my blood was tested 21 days later,
but I was still not ovulating.
	   I've been given the same medication with twice the dosage. I
haven't taken it as my period has yet to come. My husband's sperm
count is not very high. He's a smoker.
	   A: THE multiple problems you are both experiencing are
indicative of poor underlying health. Certainly smoking has been
shown to affect fertility adversely, as do all other drugs such as
caffeine, alcohol and quite a few over-the-counter medical drugs.
This, combined with the toxins that accumulate in your body through
food and water supplies and a polluted environment, makes it very
hard for women to conceive.
	   Problems such as yours are frequently resolved through a
concerted effort to resume a non-toxic lifestyle, and through
eating whole uncontaminated food, drinking purified water and
taking additional nutrient supplements.
	   Medical herbs can then act on your intrinsically more robust
organs to bring about healing. I suggest a thorough reading of my
book Better Babies and a natural fertility management conception
kit to help you monitor your cycle so you can tell if and when you
ovulate.
	   It's also important that your husband joins you in this approach
as it takes two to make a healthy baby. Preconceptual smoking has
been shown conclusively to damage male fertility and foetal health.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan _ Aid agencies ferried the critically
wounded from quake-devastated villages in northern Afghanistan on
Tuesday and appealed for more aircraft and fuel to rescue survivors
of the earthquake that killed anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 people.
	   In the village of Kol, hundreds of people swarmed a United
Nations helicopter that touched down three days after Saturday's
earthquake struck a remote mountainous area rocked three months
earlier by another massive quake that claimed some 2,300 victims.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, U.N. helicopters evacuated 50 of the most
seriously injured to emergency medical centers. Rescuers have
reached only 29 villages, or about half of those believed to have
been seriously damaged by the 6.9-magnitude quake. Of those, 12
were 80 percent to 100 percent destroyed, said Rupert Colville, a
U.N. spokesman.
	   ``It's now clear that the destruction is very wide spread,''
Colville said.
	   Survivors carried the injured on stretchers of sticks and old
clothes through winding hillside streets and past crumbled
packed-mud houses to reach the helicopters.
	   The villages' remoteness and lack of transportation were
hampering the aid effort. The United Nations, the Red Cross and
other agencies have three borrowed helicopters to deliver medical
aid.
	   The lack of aircraft ``is undercutting everything we are doing
now,'' Colville said. The agencies need at least one more cargo
plane to deliver supplies, he said.
	   Rescuers worked from the dirt airstrip of the nearby provincial
capital of Faisabad, still littered with the rusting junk of old
Soviet tanks and artillery from Afghanistan's decades-long civil
war.
	   Aid workers said it would take several weeks to get a clear
picture of how many people were killed.
	   Red Cross helicopters have delivered 2 tons of high protein
biscuits, flour and oil to victims in Shari Basurkh, near the
quake's epicenter, some 45 kilometers (27 miles) from Faisabad
	   Mohammed Karim was in Faisabad when the quake hit his village on
the outskirts of Shari Basurkh. Hitching a ride in a car, he and
four friends raced for home, walking the last few hundred meters
(yards). They found the village virtually gone.
	   ``We started digging. When we brought the people out they were
already dead,'' said Karim. ``We brought the bodies from under the
destruction and buried them without an Islamic prayer. We didn't
have time.'' .
	   Most of the injured were women, children and the elderly who had
stayed inside their homes while men worked the fields.
	   Most of the injuries are broken limbs, internal and head wounds,
said Svante Yngrot, a medical coordinator with the Red Cross. Many
of the survivors were still in shock, made worse by a series of
aftershocks.
	   ``That frightened everybody. Sixty thousand people from the
whole district will be spending the night outside.'' Colville said.
``The most traumatized were those who survived the February quake,
when they saw friends and relatives killed before their eyes. Now
they're going through it again.''

	   CLEARLY, a new approach is required ... the current global
environmental crisis is a result of dominant value systems, driven
by human greed and excessive materialism, and the mistaken belief
that science and technology hold the key to the solution of all our
problems. Seoul Declaration, World Environment Day 1997.
	   THE birth of the National Water Council has been a difficult
one. For more than 10 years, State Governments remained ambivalent
about it. It was first proposed in the 1982 National Water
Resources Study and then again in 1991 following the Malacca water
crisis; but there was not enough political will to get it started.
Not any more.
	   Current water shortages, felt most acutely by the people of
Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Penang, Johor, Sabah and northern Sarawak
have provided the much-needed catalyst to the setting up of the
council, soon to be holding its first meeting.
	   Although information remains sketchy - who are the key players,
for example, other than the fact Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad will head the council - this is still a landmark
event.
	   ``It is timely, although it is unfortunate it had to take
another water crisis for the council to materialise,'' says World
Wide Fund for Nature Malaysia conservation director Dr Isabelle
Louis.
	   The fact that the PM will chair the NWC - unlike the National
Forestry and Land Councils, headed by his deputy - shows that water
resources such as rivers, groundwater and lakes have finally and
rightfully taken their place on the national agenda.
	   While cynics may dismiss the move as too little, too late, the
creation of the NWC should be welcomed.
	   Better late than never, says Consumers Association of Penang
legal adviser Meenakshi Raman, who - like other informed
hydrologists, engineers, environmental scientists and
conservationists - has for years valiantly pushed for such a
set-up.
	   ``There must be a mechanism of checks and balances in the
council,'' she stresses.
	   The idea of the council is to coordinate and integrate the
management of land, forests and water resources, while ensuring
uniformity in practices and laws, explains another advocate,
Drainage and Irrigation Department director-general Kheizrul
Abdullah.
	   There are, for instance, over 30 related laws on water. The time
has come for politicians and the power-wielding business community
to acknowledge that land, forests and water are mutually dependent
for economic and environmental sustainability. Historically and
constitutionally, however, these natural resources have been
managed as separate entities, resulting in cross-purposes among
Federal and State agencies and the widespread scourge of passing
the buck.
	   Further, the mentality of build-first-remedy-later has shaped
the way in which forests are cleared and land is developed. Instead
of determining land uses according to the availability of water,
development projects have been allowed to take place without
considering their impact on river quality and quantity - in
particular, the river's capacity to handle the pollution loads and
the amount of water extracted. The emphasis has always been on
increasing supply rather than conserving water and protecting
rivers and groundwater against pollution.
	   While it is understandable that each State Government guards its
natural resources jealously, as these are their main sources of
revenue, guaranteed under the Constitution, nature does not
recognise man-made boundaries.
	   After all, how does one prevent pollution flowing from one State
to another? Is it fair for one State to bear the burden of
another's pollution? The issue of inter-State resources management
can no longer be sidelined. The NWC provides the appropriate
platform from which to resolve it.
	   So, how to make the NWC a force to be reckoned with?
	   Engineer Kheizrul says it is crucial that Chief Ministers and
Menteris Besar are represented in the NWC, as they are in the
National Forestry and Land Councils. After all, land and water are
inseparable, and both are State functions.
	   ``Politically,'' he argues, ``it is unlikely the Federal
Government will be allowed to take over the management of land and
water.'' For better or worse, ultimately, the onus is on State
governments.
	   It is vital that agencies with the requisite technical know-how
preside at the NWC, to give valuable advice. Equally pertinent is
the presence of the Economic Planning Unit (of the Prime Minister's
Department), as water is also a social and economic resource.
	   Although Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu failed to
include the public when he announced the set up of the NWC, it will
mollify discerning Malaysians if the council gives them an avenue
through which to voice their views and participate in
decision-making.
	   While the structure of the NWC has yet to be defined, there is
no argument that it must first draw up a National Water Policy to
provide general guidelines, which in turn must become the
principles for planning and managing the country's 150 river
basins.
	   There should be a policy regarding a grace period in which to
inform the public of the line of action when there is impending
drought or flood.
	   Much groundwork must be done if the Government is serious about
preventing another water crisis.
	   First, conflicting land uses must end.
	   To do this, Kheizrul says, ``we must think globally, act
locally'' and proposes the following to the council: Determine the
amount of water in the respective river basins; assess present land
uses to determine the demand for water and demand impact on rivers
and groundwater; and ascertain the chain of command when river
basins cover more than one State.
	   Kheizrul also proposes that, where demand exceeds supply, the
council should explore the option of tapping excess water from
neighbouring river basins.
	   He is confident that it can be done, provided there is proper
planning and integration. The excess water can be extracted, he
stresses, only after taking into account requirements for the
survival of aquatic species, navigation, and industrial and
household needs.
	   There are 150 river systems nationwide. There should be a master
plan, says Kheizrul, for each river basin, guided by NWC policy.
	   Who is to see this through?
	   There must be respective river basin authorities represented by
experts from diverse fields. The maxim is, one authority, one river
basin, with the respective State Economic Planning Units as focal
point. Why State EPUs? The choice is obvious, explains Kheizrul.
They have a direct impact on water resources as they make economic
decisions on land use.
	   Each river basin authority must be vested with the power to make
day-to- day decisions, insists Centre for Environmental
Technologies executive director Goh Kiam Seng.
	   In each master plan, says the former director-general of the
Department of Environment, there must be standard provisions for
the following: Water quality monitoring; water resource
development; flood mitigation; pollution minimisation; silt
control; landuse planning; drainage and irrigation improvement;
mangrove preservation (to act as buffer against coastal erosion);
fishing ground protection; river rehabilitation; wetland
restoration; water pricing policies; and the beautification of
rivers for recreation.
	   This, however, requires technical experts and policy-makers, in
order for the river basin authority to be effective. Goh believes
it should be chaired by no less than the Menteri Besar, with the
participation of Federal Ministers and State Exco members in charge
of the environment, science and technology, forestry, agriculture,
housing and local authorities.
	   Capitalising on existing Government machinery,
multi-disciplinary experts from various Federal and State agencies
should be placed together with scientists under a technical
committee, he says. On the other hand, the public, non-governmental
organisations, professional bodies and research institutes can play
a role on the advisory panel.
	   Still, one critical point has not figured prominently in the
debate on the current water crisis: The role of the private sector,
in view of State governments' increasing dependence on it to treat
and supply water.
	   How does the private sector fit into the scheme of things with
the NWC and river basin authorities in the making?
	   Meenakshi of CAP has doubts that the private sector can get the
nation out of its mess.
	   ``Water is too important a public resource,'' she argues, ``to
be left in the hands of the private sector.'' As profit is the
driving force of private companies, she fears that further
privatisation of water treatment and supply will widen the gap
between rich and poor.
	   She dreads the day that water will be sold to the highest
bidder, leaving the poor behind. Unequal access to water, as
history has shown, spells trouble.
	   ``The Government should reconsider privatising water supply;
current events in Selangor show it hasn't worked well,'' she urges,
referring to the case of Puncak Niaga Sdn Bhd's repeated shutdowns
of its water treatment plants at the Langat and Cheras rivers.
	   While there are pros and cons to privatisation, one thing is
clear: Consumers are fed up with water rationing. They do not want
to hear any more excuses. With the NWC and the river basin
authorities taking shape, we certainly hope things will improve.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - A report by a Commonwealth task force set
up to study the effects of foreign currency trading and influx of
short-term funds will be tabled at the annual Commonwealth Finance
Ministers' meeting in October.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said Commonwealth
secretary-general Chief Emeka Anyaoku told him this during a
meeting today.
	   He said the task force had also asked for Malaysia's views on
the matter to serve as a guideline for the study which Anwar had
proposed at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' meeting in
Mauritius last year.
	   ``We have told the study group that while foreign funds are
important, regulations on information, controls and honesty should
be respected and adhered to by all countries, companies and
financial institutions.''
	   Earlier, Anwar also met Ministers from Commonwealth countries
here for the three-day Meeting of Commonwealth Ministers
Responsible for Youth Affairs.
	   He said he gave his view that in normal and difficult economic
times, integration and discussion with youths ensured their
participation and expression of views.
	   ``If we don't do that, youths will feel sidelined. Those most
affected in difficult times are the youths, women and the
underprivileged. Their problems should be heard and solved as soon
as possible.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik
said today globalisation is transforming economies to be
increasingly borderless and its related issues have become far more
complex than ever before.
	   ``What takes place in one country or region impacts directly
upon neighbouring ones.''
	   As an example, he said, the local stock market reacted to price
movements in exchanges in Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York and London.
	   Dr Ling said these were facilitated by modern communications
systems such as Internet, fax and satellite transmit information.
	   ``Such instantaneous information can create immediate
repercussions with multiplied effects of sometimes devastating
proportions,'' he said in his presidential address at the party's
45th annual general assembly in Dewan San Choon at Wisma MCA.
	   He said huge sums of capital moved swiftly and easily from one
region to another, adding that nations had also become more exposed
to international hedge funds and currency traders.
	   Dr Ling, who is also the Transport Minister, said before long
the country might have to cope with international economic
expectations for greater free trade and liberalisation of markets.
	   Praising the leadership of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad in tackling the economic problems, he said: ``Dr Mahathir
has taken firm and urgent steps in response to such economic
challenges.
	   ``Measures are being adopted to overcome present difficulties,
while bold and innovative policies have been introduced to build a
more robust economy. Many of the steps taken are beginning to yield
encouraging and positive results.''
	   He said despite the turmoil, the country's economic fundamentals
remained sound and this had been acknowledged by overseas financial
institutions.
	   Dr Ling also pledged the party support for Dr Mahathir's call
for international regulation and supervision of the world financial
system and the latter's appeal for a strengthening of co-operation
among nations to have greater transparency in financial and capital
markets.
	   ``Without this, the economy of nations including Malaysia are
vulnerable to currency traders, and much of what have been achieved
through the hard work and sacrifice of millions are lost by the
acts of a few,'' he said.
	   The MCA would mobilise whatever capabilities and resources it
has, Dr Ling said, to assist the Prime Minister in dealing with the
economic challenges.
	   In reiterating the party's support for Dr Mahathir, he reminded
members of the mid-80s when the country had gone through a major
recession.
	   Under Dr Mahathir's decisive leadership, urgent and pragmatic
measures were then implemented to address key problems in the
economy.
	   ``He was tireless in seeking foreign investments and in
restructuring the economy to be more diversified and less dependent
on primary commodities.
	   ``The country steadily recovered, and subsequently enjoyed more
than a full decade of strong economic growth,'' Dr Ling added.
	   He said the party was certain that Dr Mahathir's policies and
approach, intended for the overall good of the nation, would once
again guide us through the present financial crisis.
	   He also reminded Malaysians that the strength and greatness of a
nation is not reflected in its wealth or military power.
	   It is to be found, Dr Ling said, in the resourcefulness and
discipline of its citizens.
	   ``It is a great nation, if its people can rally together in
troubled times and lift high their spirits, hopes and their
confidence. And through all these such a nation retains a sense of
calmness, tolerance, moderation and fairness,'' Dr Ling added.
	   ``Malaysia under the leadership of Dr Mahathir, who is also the
head of the Barisan Nasional, has this character and quality.''
	   MCA would work with undiminished zeal, he said, to ensure that
the Prime Minister's vision of the country in the year 2020 would
be fulfilled.
	   He further reminded the people that there were only 580 days to
the start of the millennium and that the character as Malaysians
would be tested as we progress towards the year 2000.
	   ``We are mindful that the task before us will not be easy. But
we, as a community, share with other Malaysians a quality of
resilience and toughness so that situations of adversity will be
turned into occasions of opportunities.''
	   Thus, it was with hope and confidence, Dr Ling said, that we
prepared our community for the new era.
	   ``As the new century approaches, we will be a community that
remains loyal and patriotic.
	   ``Our members, through enterprise and application of skills,
will continue to help develop the economy towards fully developed
status.''
	   The community looks forward with confidence to the new
millennium, Dr Ling said, because it has faith in the leaders and
in their vision.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine met the International Monetary

dlrs 2.5 billion loan will be granted, the country's top banker
said Tuesday.
	   National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said the conditions
related to the bank's foreign currency reserves and Ukraine's
budget deficit.
	   The government took measures last week to reduce the expected
budget deficit to 2.3 percent of gross domestic from 3.3 percent,
although the plan still needs to be approved by parliament.
	   The IMF refused to approve a loan to Ukraine last year because
of the country's stalled economic reforms.
	   An IMF delegation is scheduled to return to Ukraine in mid-June,
followed by the fund's head Michel Camdessus on June 20, to assess
progress toward implementing the loan conditions.
	   ``Summing up the month of May with the broad view of the program
in mind, we can say that we would have a good basis for the next
round of talks with the IMF mission,'' Yushchenko said in comments
carried by the Interfax news agency.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad said while he was saddened by the 50 per cent depreciation
in the value of the ringgit, he was proud of the people's
resilience and unstinting support in tackling the economic
problems.
	   Dr Mahathir said the problems had boosted everybody's
self-confidence, courage, dedication and the will to confront
head-on economic problems which he described as the ``enemy''
	   ``It is pointless to grumble without doing anything which could
help oneself and the country in facing the problems,'' the Prime
Minister and Barisan Nasional chairman said when addressing the
45th annual MCA general assembly here today.
	   There was a strong turnout of former MCA stalwarts at the AGM.
They included life president Tan Sri Lee San Choon, Tun Omar Ong
Yoke Lin, Tan Koon Swan, Datuk Dr Neo Yee Pan, Datuk Lee Kim Sai,
and Tan Sri Chong Hon Nyan. This was commended by Dr Mahathir who
saw this as evidence of solidarity in MCA. He said it was
unfortunate that sometimes when politicians no longer held a post,
they stayed away from party activities.
	   ``This happens to all parties, not excluding Umno. I am happy to
see the interest taken by former MCA leaders.''
	   Among the Barisan Nasional party leaders present were MIC
president Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, Gerakan president Datuk Seri Dr
Lim Keng Yaik, Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu vice-president Datuk
Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud, Liberal Democratic Party president Datuk
Chong Kah Kiat and PPP president Datuk M. Kayveas.
	   Later, speaking to reporters, Dr Mahathir welcomed the proposal
by former Umno deputy president Tun Ghafar Baba that the party
allow the setting up of an Umno Veterans' Club to enable party
veterans to contribute to national development.
	   Earlier, Dr Mahathir received a standing ovation when MCA
president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik pledged the party's support
for him to remain as Prime Minister for ``many, many more years to
come''.
	   Dr Mahathir said he took the support as one for the country and
the people.
	   On the economic problems, Dr Mahathir said this was the time to
show the capability of Malaysians to face the problem in a
rational, systematic and practical manner.
	   ``First and foremost, we strengthen our unity, then boost our
productivity, increase savings and also the nation's
competitiveness.''
	   In this context, he was happy that the MCA had undertaken
several programmes to ease the economic pressure, especially its
efforts to raise money for various funds.
	   ``Actually we have the wealth, but it is not used as the need
does not arise. By this I mean savings and assets, especially
jewelleries, which do not give us returns.''
	   He said this wealth should be mobilised as capital for the
country, and utilised by businessmen which could help revive
economic activities.
	   Dr Mahathir congratulated the MCA for its campaign to buy local
products. ``We supply the world with quality goods. Now we should
buy our own quality goods to help our businesses to recover.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Delegates to the 45th MCA general assembly
today passed five resolutions, one calling for the support and
implementation of the party's Eight-Point Political Agenda.
	   The political agenda encompassed the economy, culture,
education, religion, women and youth affairs, sports, senior
citizen affairs and social welfare.
	   Others include the endorsement of the resolution adopted by the
Convention on Innovation and Reforms of the Malaysian Chinese
Community and to draw up a blueprint for the party to lead the
community into the new millennium.
	   The delegates also welcomed the RM1.5 billion for the
small-and-medium industries fund set up by the Government. They
urged the authorities to simplify the rules of the fund, be fair in
processing and be prompt in approving applications to deserving
cases.
	   The resolution also: called for support of the RM2 billion
Special Housing Fund to finance medium and low-cost housing
development; urged the State Governments to expedite the
implementation of the programme to enable Malaysians to lease state
land for agriculture to help raise food production; called on the
party to continue holding ``Love Malaysia'' gatherings to encourage
the people to buy Made-in-Malaysia goods, holiday locally, save
with local banks and study in local institutions; and, supported
the Special Fund to enhance the people's sense of patriotism.
	   On privatisation, the resolution urged the relevant government
departments to step up supervision of the privatised projects.
	   It also supported the setting up of a National Water Council
with a comprehensive and long term policy on water supply
management to ensure uninterrupted water supply.
	   A resolution on education called on the Government to increase
places in the local universities.
	   Delegates also urged the Government to approve the setting up of
more private universities and allow existing private colleges to
conduct more science and technical courses.

Milosevic gives opponents in Montenegro 100 days. Djukanovic party 100 days to make good on promises; trims. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Milosevic camp giving
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backers of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic challenged his foes in Montenegro on Tuesday to
make good on promises of the good life for voters, giving them 100
days to do so.
	   The moderate reaction to the election victory led by reformist
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic indicated that for now
Milosevic and his Montenegrin proxies would not directly challenge
the poll results.
	   With Djukanovic expected to use his victory to try to unseat
Milosevic, there had been fears that the Yugoslav strongman would
declare the election invalid and send troops into Montenegro, the
smaller of the two republics making up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   The new government of Djukanovic supporters ``will be given 100
days to prove it can fulfill promises ... of a better life for
all,'' said Predrag Bulatovic, deputy chairman of Montenegro's
Socialist People's Party.
	   His statement, carried by Tanjug, Yugoslavia's state news
agency, did not say what would happen after 100 days.
	   Bulatovic spoke after Milosevic ally Momir Bulatovic _ whose
supporters lost the elections _ was summoned to Belgrade for urgent
consultations with the Yugoslav president. The two Bulatovics are
not related.
	   With both Montenegro and larger Serbia holding the same number
of seats in Yugoslavia's federal parliament, Djukanovic is believed
to be planning to stack the Yugoslav parliament with his
supporters. They could then team up with the Serbian opposition to
unseat Milosevic or at least weaken his rule.
	   No political analyst in Yugoslavia can imagine Milosevic going
quietly. Since rising to power in Serbia in 1987, the wily
Milosevic has used a powerfully effective mix of nationalism, tight
media control and autocratic methods to cement his hold on power.
	   But Djukanovic's presidential victory in October, coupled with
Sunday's parliamentary win by his supporters, seriously weakened
Milosevic's grip.
	   Djukanovic said in an interview with the independent Belgrade
Radio Index on Tuesday that Milosevic ``will have to accept the new
Montenegrin political reality.''
	   He accused Milosevic of destroying Yugoslavia with his
``arrogant obstinacy'' and said Milosevic ``will have to take the
blame for the collapse of the country which he is running'' if he
continues attempts to subjugate Montenegro.
	   Djukanovic first challenged the Yugoslav power-broker in the
winter of 1996-1997, coming out against Milosevic during massive
protests against his rule.
	   Then last fall, the Montenegrin narrowly beat Momir Bulatovic _
his former best friend _ for the republic's presidency.
	   Strongly backed by Washington and Western Europe, Djukanovic
took office in January.
	   His triumph in Sunday's elections will hand him a majority in
the 78-seat Montenegrin parliament, and has a large say in who gets
sent to Yugoslavia's federal parliament.
	   Djukanovic said in the radio interview that he would insist on
Momir Bulatovic being replaced as federal premier. Milosevic
maneuvered his protege into that office two weeks ago after the
previous premier refused to crack down on Djukanovic's pro-Western
reforms.
	   Djukanovic's aides have suggested that he might seek a
referendum in Montenegro on the republic's secession from
Yugoslavia if Milosevic doesn't replace Bulatovic.

<TEXT>
	   MALAYSIA has relied on a broad spectrum of measures, including
interest rates, to promote macroeconomic stability and economic
recovery, Bank Negara said in a statement late yesterday.
	   ``At the current interest rate level, the real rate of return on
deposits (after taking into account the expected rate of inflation)
is being maintained at levels prevailing before the crisis.''
	   ``This has allowed savings in Malaysia to be efficiently
mobilised through the banking system. One of Malaysia's strengths
has been the ability of the banking system to mobilise a
significant volume of savings to finance economic activity (sic).
	   ``Appropriate interest rate levels are also necessary to contain
the outflow of funds abroad. Malaysia considers exchange rate
stability an important element in the recovery process. In this
context, appropriate (sic) macroeconomic policy including interest
rate policy is important for overall confidence on (sic) the
economic and financial system.''
	   The central bank's statement followed issues that have been
raised on interest rates including a statement by the Prime
Minister that the rates were now too high.
	   The statement was even mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim when he was asked to
comment on interest rates earlier in the day.
	   Bank Negara said its statement was aimed at clarifying the
``current monetary policy stance''.
	   It said the interest rate policy continues to aim to balance the
need to maintain price stability and a stable exchange rate while
ensuring that productive activity is not undermined.
	   ``At the current interest rate, this balance is being addressed
within the comprehensive set of policies adopted in December 1997
and March this year,'' it said, in an apparent defence of its tight
monetary regime.
	   The statement explained its balance of inflationary pressures
and exchange rate stability which it said was necessary to rebuild
market confidence and maintain international competitiveness.
	   It also retraced the developments in the market which led to the
reduction in the statutory reserve requirement by 3.5 per cent with
no net addition to liquidity, making banking institutions more
transparent in pricing and daily announcement of central bank
operations in the money market.
	   These measures have led to lending rates now declining to 12-16
per cent from over 20 per cent previously when the market was
distorted by the tight monetary policy.
	   Bank Negara also announced yesterday that the three-month
interbank weighted average base lending rate for May was 11.03 per
cent per annum.
	   The bank also outlined the various funds and schemes that would
ensure productive sectors are not denied access to reasonable rates
of financing.
	   They include the Small and Medium Industry Fund, Export Credit
Refinancing, Housing Developers Facility, Suppliers, Buyers and
Overseas Investment Credit, Fund For Food and the Petty Traders and
Hawkers Fund.
	   It also referred to funding by external agencies like the Exim
Bank of Japan (US$300 million) (RM1.17 billion), World Bank (US$1
billion) and Islamic Development Bank (US$200 million) for social
``safety net'' projects and to reduce the impact of the adverse
regional developments on the vital segments of the economy.

Swiss hope report will lead to `more objective discussion' With US-Nazi Gold 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Tuesday welcomed a U.S.
government report concluding that neutral nations supplied Nazi
Germany with hundreds of millions of dollars of trade, and stressed
that its own efforts to reappraise its past continue.
	   ``In regard to Switzerland, the American report contains no
essentially new findings,'' the ruling Federal Council said in a
statement.
	   A U.S. report last year accused Switzerland of providing
financing to Nazi Germany that prolonged World War II.
	   The coalition cabinet said it hopes the report ``will contribute
to more objective discussion, particularly in the United States, on
Switzerland's role during World War II.''
	   ``It says in effect that it is wrong to oversimplify and
apportion historic blame on the basis of isolated facts,'' the
statement added.
	   Swiss commercial banks, Jewish organizations and lawyers for
class-action claimants are currently involved in negotiations on a
global settlement of claims by Holocaust victims.
	   Class-action suits totaling dlrs 23 billion have been filed in
the United States against Swiss banks and insurance companies on
behalf of Holocaust victims and their heirs.
	   Jewish organizations have accused the banks of delays in
allowing Holocaust victims' heirs access to dormant assets.
	   The Swiss cabinet said the publication last week by an
independent panel of historians of a study on Switzerland's gold
dealings with Germany ``proves that Switzerland takes the
reappraisal of its history seriously.''
	   The government ``welcomes the fact that the U.S. government is
also taking this course,'' the statement added.
	   The U.S. ambassador in Bern, Madeleine May Kunin, paid tribute
in a statement to Switzerland's efforts to address its past.
	   ``Switzerland stands at the forefront of this international
effort to address one of the darkest chapters in history,'' she
said.

<SLUG> Baxter suspends European blood-substitute test,0385 </SLUG>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Baxter International announced Tuesday it had
suspended European tests of its HemAssist product in trauma victims
after early results found no statistical benefits, in a further
sign that its oxygen-carrying blood substitute has run into
trouble.
	   The move comes less than two months after Baxter suspended
testing in U.S. emergency rooms after more patients who used
HemAssist died than did those in the control group. The Deerfield,
Illinois-based pharmaceutical giant found that 46.2 percent of the
people given HemAssist died, more than the projected 42.6 percent
mortality rate and well above the 17.4 percent in the control
group.
	   Baxter is continuing U.S. trials on the blood substitute on
elective surgery patients, but the delays in emergency room testing
mean the company now will not receive marketing approval here or
abroad until at least 2001 and again throws open the race for an
effective blood substitute.
	   Northfield Laboratories Inc., Biopure Corp. and Alliance
Pharmaceutical Corp. also are working to develop a viable blood
substitute.
	   The race to find a blood substitute has been intense because
artificial blood could ease the effects of whole-blood shortages,
lasts longer than conventional blood, eliminates the time-consuming
need to match blood types and wipes out the risk of contamination
with such viruses as HIV and hepatitis.
	   The market represents instant billion-dollar potential because
it can be used on battlefields and at accidents, as well as in poor
countries that have weak blood bank networks. Also, members of some
religious groups refuse to accept transfusions of human blood.
	   Baxter said it had enrolled 117 patients in the European trauma
test and, after consulting on the initial data of 79 of those
patients with European regulators, decided to stop the test to
further analyze the data.
	   ``We are not seeing a statistically significant clinical
benefit'' of using HemAssist, said spokeswoman Mary Thomas.
	   ``It's very early, but we decided it's best to analyze all the
data so we can appropriately determine the direction we should
take,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - In a move to improve air quality, the
Cabinet has directed the phasing out of the sale and use of leaded
petrol, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri
Megat Junid Megat Ayob said today.
	   He said the decision was made at the Cabinet meeting last
Wednesday.
	   ``The Ministry issued a directive to petrol dealers on Thursday
to use up their supplies of leaded petrol,'' he said at a Press
conference after launching a seminar on The Role of Consumers in
the Economic Situation.
	   The event was organised by the Ministry and Puspanita, in
conjunction with the latter's 16th annual general meeting.
	   Megat Junid said petrol stations would not get new supplies of
leaded petrol.
	   He added that the Association of Petroleum Dealers of Malaysia
had recommended four years ago that the sale and use of leaded
petrol be phased out.
	   However, the matter was only seriously discussed with the
Ministry in March this year.
	   The Ministry had consulted the relevant Ministries including the
Science, Technology and Environment Ministry, and Transport
Ministry.
	   A meeting will be held next week to discuss the phasing-out
process, including switching vehicles using leaded petrol to
unleaded petrol.
	   ``The complete phasing out depends on how soon petrol dealers
can use up their stock,'' he said.
	   Megat Junid said the association had claimed that the cost of
production of leaded petrol was higher than revenue from its sale.
	   ``This is because there are fewer vehicles using leaded petrol
than those using the unleaded petrol,'' he said.
	   Last year, the consumption of leaded petrol was one million
litres compared to five million litres for unleaded petrol.
	   The low consumption of leaded petrol had made it difficult for
oil companies to source the commodity.
	   On another development, Megat Junid said the ministry would
revoke licences of direct selling companies which collect deposits
through membership recruitment.
	   He said the Ministry's licences allowed direct selling companies
to sell their products, not to make easy money at other people's
expense.
	   He urged the public to lodge police reports or inform the
ministry if they were approached by such companies.

Belarusian lawyer stripped of license; known as government critic 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A prominent Belarusian lawyer known for
defending critics of the authoritarian government was stripped of
his license Tuesday on a technicality.
	   The government said Garri Pogonyailo had forfeited his right to
practice law in Belarus when he joined a Russian collegium of
lawyers _ the equivalent of a bar association.
	   Pogonyailo complained that the ruling by a Justice Ministry
commission contradicted international law and Belarus' obligations
under its Union Treaty with Russia, which created a close alliance
between the two neighbors.
	   He said that the commission had acted against him ``because when
defending citizens in the courts, I defended their rights without
compromise, and openly criticized the activities of the authorities
when they violated the law. This is the price I have to pay.''
	   Pogonyailo received international attention last year when he
defended Pavel Sheremet, a reporter for a Russian television
station who was arrested for illegally crossing the Belarusian
border while filming a story.
	   The case became a cause celebre for opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko, and seriously strained relations between
Belarus and Russia.
	   More recently, Pogonyailo has been defending Pavel Severinets,
the 21-year-old leader of the opposition Popular Youth Front who
has been in jail since his April 12 arrest at an anti-government
rally. On Tuesday, the prosecutor general's office ordered him to
remain in jail for one more month.
	   Pogonyailo has said he joined the Russian lawyers' association

	   GENEVA (AP) _ From the United States to Malta, 46 countries on
Tuesday demanded that rival neighbors India and Pakistan
immediately stop testing nuclear arms and join efforts to eliminate
the weapons.
	   Islamic countries and some non-nuclear countries expressed
concern about the recent tests, but they blamed the five
traditional nuclear powers _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States _ for failing to heed the concerns of India and
Pakistan.
	   In an all-day emergency session of the 61-nation Conference on
Disarmament, the non-nuclear countries urged the five powers to
drop their opposition to proposed negotiations to eliminate their
atomic arsenals.
	   India and Pakistan maintain that such talks according to a
``time-bound framework'' would be the only way to address the
security needs of all countries.
	   Indian Ambassador Savitri Kunadi said if the five traditional
nuclear powers had accepted India's attempts to set up global
nuclear disarmament, ``we need not have gone in for our current
testing program.''
	   Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States insist they
are eliminating their arsenals, but the matter cannot be subjected
to global bargaining.
	   The conference, the world's main forum for negotiating
disarmament agreements, said in a joint statement that the recent
Indian and Pakistani tests flouted the test ban treaty.
	   The five nuclear powers were among the countries that signed the
joint statement spearheaded by Australia and New Zealand.
	   ``The testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan is
totally irreconcilable with claims by both countries that they are
committed to nuclear disarmament,'' it said.
	   Pakistani Ambassador Munir Akram welcomed the debate, which said
``widely acknowledged'' that Pakistan was only reacting to ``the
nuclear threat emanating from India.''
	   India's and Pakistan's tests last month ``blatantly undermine''
attempts to halt nuclear proliferation and threaten to undermine
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons, and belong ``to a bygone
age,'' the conference statement said.
	   The statement said it was ``crucial that India and Pakistan
announce immediately a cessation to all further testing of these
weapons, renounce their nuclear weapons programs and sign and
ratify unconditionally the comprehensive test ban treaty.''
	   Also supporting the demand were Japan, South Korea, South Africa
and European and Latin American nations, but conspicuously missing
were Middle Eastern countries.
	   Iran said it viewed the developments with ``deep concern,'' but
said what is needed is ``an all-encompassing program for
comprehensive nuclear disarmament.''
	   Despite Tehran's denials, Iran is widely believed to be pursuing
its own nuclear-weapons program.
	   On Monday Iran's foreign minister said on a visit to Islamabad
that Muslims welcomed Pakistan's nuclear tests because it gives the
Islamic world a bomb to counter Israel's widely suspected arsenal.
	   South African Ambassador Jacob S. Selebi said it was
``imperative'' that the conference tackle nuclear disarmament.

	   SHAH ALAM, Mon. - Three Ministries, Sukom Ninety-Eight Berhad
and Commonwealth Games Federation will work closely to attract
local and foreign spectators to Kuala Lumpur for the Commonwealth
Games and promote the sale of tickets.
	   Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the
Ministry of Arts, Tourism and Culture was working towards promoting
and attracting both local and foreign tourists and spectators to
visit Malaysia during the Commonwealth Games scheduled from Sept 11
to 21.
	   The Information Ministry, he added, would disseminate
information on the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, the dates,
venues and tickets, besides distributing newsletters and pamphlets.
Tickets will go on sale in July.
	   He said they had also sought the help of the Commonwealth Games
Federation and Sukom Ninety-Eight Bhd.
	   ``We are confident that with careful planning and aggressive
promotion, the tickets will be sold, especially with 67 out of the
69 countries having given the green light that they will be sending
their teams to participate,'' he added.
	   Locals and foreigners can get detailed information on the
Internet.
	   Muhyiddin was speaking to reporters after attending a
closed-door liaison committee meeting with Sukan Malaysia and Youth
Exco followed by luncheon with with Selangor Menteri Besar at a
hotel here today.
	   ``The weather is good, there is no haze and the problem of water
is being seriously looked into. There is no reason for spectators
to keep away from the Games,'' he added.
	   Muhyiddin appealed to all State Governments, government
departments, bodies and agencies, non-governmental organisations,
public and private sectors to help make the event a resounding
success.
	   At the lunch, Abu Hassan said the State Government was committed
to youth development as the youth played an important role in
nation-building.
	   He said the Selangor Government had approved an allocation of
RM20 million for the construction of Kuala Langat Youth Training
Centre which would not only help produce skilled workers but also
hold training programmes for youths in the field of information
technology.
	   ``The training centre hopefully will produce enough manpower to
meet the demand especially with the coming of mega projects such
Multimedia Super Corridor, and Cyberjaya,'' he added.

Non-performing loans: How the AMC can help, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

<TEXT>
	   ON May 20, Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim made an
epochal pronouncement: a special agency, to be called the Asset
Management Company, would be established to manage non-performing
loans of financial institutions.
	   The rationale for creating an asset management corporation is
simple. If we flip back a page or two of history we would realise
that many banks and financial institutions had been enervated by
imprudent loans to unproductive sectors over the past several
years.
	   Lending to unproductive sectors are loans to speculators in the
stock as well as the property markets. This profligate dispensation
of credit resulted in a high percentage of non-performing loans.
	   Readers of the financial pages of the daily papers will
understand what are NPLs. But for those who don't, NPLs are loans
that are not serviced.
	   Phrased in language that all would understand, the borrowers did
not pay even the interest due on the loans they had taken over a
period of time.
	   In good times, the period to designate loans as NPLs was six
months. But late last year, the central bank changed this to three
months as was the international norm. This was a factor but not the
sole factor that perforced financial institutions to record in
their accounts a high incidence of NPLs.
	   In some cases, the proportion of NPLs against total loans
disbursed was as high as 14 per cent. This was the primary reason
why one bank, Sime Bank, suffered losses of RM1.5 billion and had
to be taken over by RHB in a complex restructuring exercise that
necessitated an injection of RM1.8 billion in fresh funds.
	   Following the intervention of the central bank which issued
guidelines to curb lending, the percentage of NPLs has been reduced
to 9.3 as at the end of March. But the actual numbers are big and
warrant grave concern.
	   Bank Negara's statistics place the amount of NPLs at 9.3 per
cent of all outstanding loans which totalled about RM500 billion at
the end of March.
	   This works out to RM46.5 billion.
	   The figure is a mere statistic, signifying little to many
readers. To understand the burden financial institutions have to
endure, let us examine an example of a bank that has RM1 billion in
deposits in savings accounts and in fixed deposits. The former
requires the bank to grant six per cent in annual interest while
the latter would warrant 10 per cent, at current rates. Averaged,
it works out to about eight per cent on deposits or RM80 million.
	   To service these deposits, the bank dispenses loans at an annual
interest rate of at least 14 per cent, netting, if it uses all the
cash at its disposal, more than RM140 million. It might even be as
high as RM160 million.
	   So when the profit and loss account is declared, the bank will
have gained RM80 million. This is hunky-dory. But the rub is, many,
if not most, financial institutions, have loans in their books that
are not serviced by borrowers. In other words, NPLs.
	   The bank had given out RM1 billion in loans. If 9.3 per cent of
the loans is not serviced after the first three months, the loss
the bank would have to bear would be a nominal RM93 million. Such a
figure could easily erase the profit of the bank.
	   True, loans disbursed are based on a percentage of the value of
the collateral borrowers tender. Given the market norm,
disbursement of loans would only be between 60 and 70 per cent of
the value of assets.
	   But a lender would not be overly preoccupied with the value of
the collateral he has. His prime concern would be: The amount of
money he has to provide in interest on the deposits he has
collected; and The amount of money he receives in interest on the
loans he had disbursed.
	   If the two match, he is solvent; if his loan portfolio yields
more than he has to dispense on deposits, he would be happy.
	   The problem, however, is that his non-performing loans would eat
up his profits. Simplified, NPLs accounting for slightly more than
nine per cent of total loans would easily erase the nine per cent
profit of any bank.
	   And that in sum, is a basic fact that the authorities have
acknowledged.
	   Acknowledging NPLs is one thing, but coming up with an answer to
at least manage that problem is another.
	   This is where the Asset Management Company comes in. First
readers must realise there are many asset managing companies. By
genre, these are companies that invite and attract cash which are
then invested in various instruments, like equities, fixed
deposits, the money market and in bonds and goverment issued bills.
Their main objective is to generate good returns on the funds they
receive.
	   But the AMC envisaged by the Government is of a slightly
different pedigree. Its primary objective is to buy the NPLs from
the financial institutions at a discount and later rehabilitate the
loans or sell them to interested companies.
	   Conversely, the purchase by AMC of the NPLs would relieve
financial institutions of a burden, resulting in at least three
ramifications.
	   First, the sale of NPLs would provide the financial institutions
with fresh funds to give new loans. Second, the institutions would
be freed from the debilitating costs of servicing deposits that
fund the NPLs.
	   Third, the institutions would no longer carry in their accounts,
suspended interest on the NPLs.
	   In sum, the financial institutions would be placed on a solid
plank to continue with their everyday business of accepting
deposits and lending money.
	   The logical question that follows is: how will the AMC be
funded, if it is to be entrusted with buying NPLs totalling RM46.5
billion even at a 10 or 20 per cent discount? The amount adds up to
a hefty figure.
	   That question cannot be answered now since details will only be
made available this week. But sources conversant with the concept
of the AMC say the funds will come from, one, ``sovereign loans''
which are loans provided by the Government; two, foreign investors
who might be willing to take up equity in the AMC; and, three,
local investors.
	   The next question is: how will the AMC undertake its task?
Again, we have to wait for details that the Government will spell
out this week. In the meantime, however, we can look at one
precedent in the United States.
	   Which brings us to the Resolute Trust Corporation, one of the
models that the AMC is said to be ``loosely'' framed upon. Why was
the RTC created?
	   In the US, thousands of small banks, commonly known as Savings
and Loans companies flourished in the 1970s and early 1980s. They
basically invited deposits and gave loans to buyers of houses.
	   Peter Lynch, in his book, Beating The Street, says many of the
SLs became greedy. Entrepreneurs took over these small companies
and began to disburse loans to dubious development projects in the
early 80s. For a while, the loan portfolios and high interest rates
made these SLs attractive investment vehicles. But recession set
in and there were few takers of houses, apartments and shopping
malls that the SLs bankrolled.
	   The result was a financial fiasco the US had never encountered
before.
	   Beginning in the late 80s as many as 2,900 SLs were in
financial trouble, forcing the George Bush administration to enact
various laws, one of which established the RTC. This agency was
entrusted with managing and disposing of the assets and liabilities
of the failed SL companies.
	   According to Lynch, the RTC had to bail out the SLs at a cost
of about US$500 billion (about RM1.9 trillion) that is still being
paid by American taxpayers.
	   Now why would we want to frame a company on the American model
that was established to bail out troubled banks. The answer is not
simple.
	   AMC is not a replica of RTC. Its character is different. The
difference will be manifest in an article next week.

	   JITRA, Mon. - About 100 padi farmers at Kampung Tebing and
Kampung Bukit near here have claimed their crops would fail if
water from a nearby river is not released into their fields soon.
	   The farmers claimed the Kubang Pasu Department of Irrigation and
Drainage had been uncooperative by not releasing water from the
Sungai Kampung Tebing into the fields.
	   ``This is causing our crops to wilt. The rain over the last few
days has not been of much help and we need more water,'' farmer
Hashim Saad, 56, said.
	   ``The DID used to help us by releasing water from the river into
our fields but they do not seem to be interestd in doing so this
year.
	   Hashim claimed about 70ha of padi fields in the village were
affected by the problem.
	   He said there was nothing much the farmers could do as their
fields were located outside the Muda Agriculture Development
Authority area and they relied entirely on rain and river water for
their fields.
	   Asked to comment on the farmers grievances, a Kubang Pasu DID
spokesman, who declined to be named, said the department was aware
of the problem.
	   However, he said there was nothing much the department could do
as the water level at Sungai Tebing was too low because of the
drought.
	   ``We cannot pump water into the padi fields now,'' he said.
	   ``Hopefully, the situation will improve over the next few weeks
and we can then see what can be done to help the farmers.''

	   YOU used to have to be a teenager before you got to be part of
the in crowd, but not any more. These days, even a six-year-old is
at ease with ``cool'' language and other contemporary flavours like
the Spice Girls.
	   Education and exposure to instant communications have turned
today's under-18s into a generally confident and articulate lot,
with a mind of their own and a will to match. This, however, can be
double-edged.
	   In a consumption-oriented generation, merchandise marketing is
aimed with deadly accuracy at a teenage segment that wants to be
trendy at all costs.
	   The tobacco industry knows it and pours millions annually into
capturing this lucrative market through advertising, new flavoured
and smokeless products, and brand-name merchandise.
	   This is the battlefront on which activists consistently have to
face off the industry, to reach the hearts and minds of youngsters
first so that they make an informed and sustained choice of health
over tobacco use.
	   The World Health Organisation has dedicated the coming year to
efforts that will help the young grow up without tobacco, a
reference to both direct products and merchandise sold under the
same brand-names.
	   It recommends campaigns based on research and planning, to be
pursued in ``tireless, strategic and aggressive'' fashion as a
national agenda.
	   But Malaysians are only too familiar with the static domestic
setting in which tobacco production, cigarette manufacture,
subsidiary businesses of tobacco companies and indirect brand-name
promotions exist side by side.
	   Without comprehensive laws, the Health Ministry relies on
regulations to control tobacco use in public places including
schools and university campuses. Enforcement, however sporadic,
should not be the only solution.
	   The ministry's second (and latest) national health and morbidity
survey in 1996 found that 16.7 per cent (539,000) of adolescents
smoke; more of them are boys; and that prevalence is higher in
rural areas. In the first survey 10 years ago, adolescent smoking
stood at nine per cent.
	   With rare candour, the report concedes ``the public health
sector lags 10 to 20 years behind transnational tobacco companies
... failure to act aggressively from the 1970s has made action in
the 1990s more difficult''.
	   Over the years, tobacco activists have protested the absence of
a national action plan that addresses the special needs of youth
smokers and discourages the creation of new generations of young
nicotine addicts.
	   Their concern could only have been amplified earlier this week
when Deputy Education Minister Datuk Khalid Yunus glibly denounced
``truancy and smoking'' as twin terrors of the school population.
	   Teachers and parents were told to deal with it although they are
no closer to being given the resources, support services or
specialised training to handle prevention, counselling and smoking
cessation work.
	   Recent developments in industrialised countries, where smoking
trends are on the decline due to tough laws and increasing social
disapproval, require a parallel and immediate review of the
Malaysian response.
	   For instance, US tobacco companies have found that strong
policies on youth tobacco use, litigation and community activism at
home are impeding business expansion, and are therefore building up
markets abroad.
	   National Centre for Tobacco-Free Kids (TFK) William Novelli
warned of this last May when he called on Americans to take
responsibility for public health affected by the external
activities of ``US Tobacco''.
	   It has since begun a global initiative that has caught the
interest of tobacco activists in India, Turkey, Poland, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Zambia to date.
	   The centre hopes to align US trade policies with health
policies, provide technical support and funding to the no-tobacco
lobby in other countries, and co-ordinate worldwide strategies.
	   Over the past year, too, internal documents of tobacco companies
have revealed that the youth market has always been a prime target
to replenish a customer-base of adult smokers who die or who quit
smoking.
	   National Poison Centre (NPC) director and no-tobacco campaigner
Professor Dzulkifli Abdul Razak says the Government must be alert
to industry spin-doctors moving in on children with purportedly
positive sponsorship.
	   He cites the example of a shopping complex in Penang which has
cigarette advertisements ``plastered all over'' an area where World
Cup '98 is being promoted, pulling in the football fans among
shoppers.
	   ``Despite the norms of the International Olympic Committee and
WHO against associating sports with tobacco products, this still
goes on,'' he says.
	   ``We should not have flip-flop policies where ministries
obviously don't agree with one another because it confuses the
public. Are we then justified in blaming teenagers for smoking?''
	   The Health Ministry attempts co-ordination of relevant
ministries, non- governmental organisations and universities
through a no-tobacco committee set up last year.
	   ``It now disseminates information on the hazards of smoking.
Next, it will encourage non-smokers to exercise their rights to a
smoke-free environment,'' says principal assistant director Dr
Sallehuddin Abu Bakar.
	   Smoking cessation programmes are being designed to supplement
clinics run by various bodies while government doctors and health
education officers are to be trained to counsel patients who want
to stop smoking.
	   Under the next phase, NGO personnel will receive similar
training to expand outreach and take no-smoking assistance into
communities. The ministry has also designed a self-help booklet to
help people quit smoking.
	   However, every target group - patients with smoking-related
illnesses, pregnant women, ``quitters'' and youths - requires
different handling that takes into account individual needs in
prevention and rehabilitation.
	   Malaysian Cancer Council (Makna) project manager Farahida
Mohamed Farid says youth-oriented no-tobacco work only skims the
surface of the problem.
	   ``Children are not stupid, but they should not be getting mixed
messages.
	   NGOs could help out more if the Education Ministry allows free
contact between no-tobacco advocates and schools,'' she says.
	   ``There are groups that would like to help schools set up an
Action on Smoking or Health (ASH) Club, for instance. Information
and activity kits could be provided to help members organise and
monitor projects.''
	   Even looking at youths alone will be an intensive and extensive
exercise, as the experience of the US-based Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids has shown (see accompanying story).
	   Operating under the auspices of the National Centre for TFK, the
campaign is into its third year and has achieved a key objective -
to capture the imagination and excitement of the American public
including youngsters.
	   ``It may make you angry that tobacco hurts children and that
tobacco companies make their money by addicting children to
nicotine. Does it make you angry enough to want to do something
about it?'' it asks children.
	   There is reason for concern. Each day, 3,000 American youngsters
become regular smokers and US youth smoking rates were at a 17-year
high last year.
	   Asked if the initiative could be replicated in Malaysia, the
NPC's Dzulkifli says a coalition of NGOs could do this if they can
put aside ``territorialism'' to work out details.
	   Although the fragmentation of interests could get in the way, he
sees this as a source of strength to extend youth-related
information and activities from different perspectives, towards a
holistic strategy.
	   Farahida, who suggests priority for youth smoking-cessation
programmes and training of school counsellors, adds it will be
crucial to get working committees going and to ensure continuity of
work.
	   Up to now, children themselves have not been asked to find
solutions to tobacco use, but have only been told they are a
problem. This leads to a ``then what?'' question that has never
been adequately answered by adults.
	   The Campaign for TFK creates fun projects without losing sight
of serious messages. It tracks and provides current news on the
tobacco industry, legislation and projects on its website
(www.tobaccofreekids.org).
	   Tobacco control is promoted through Kick Butts Day, a nationwide
event to encourage leadership among youngsters. Activists are
recognised as Youth Advocates of the Year, while young actors serve
as Youth Ambassadors.
	   This dovetails with the WHO's suggestion to let young people
``take on the tobacco industry'' and demand actions like
tobacco-advertising bans, through letters to officials in
government and industry and to the media.
	   For, as Novelli of the National Centre for TFK says: ``We don't
have time or money to be timid or patient. Tinkering at the margins

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The national health scheme should be
operated solely by a government-owned corporation as this will keep
administration costs to the minimum through efficient management.
	   Federal Territory MCA delegate Dr Milton Lum said with its
limited resources, the country could not afford ``the wasteful
extravagance'' of the American health system.
	   Dr Lum, a former Malaysian Medical Association president, said
during a debate on the presidential address at the MCA's annual
general assembly that policy-makers should include human health as
part of the planning process.
	   ``Development, which has been the focus of our nation, has come
with a price and may affect the health of the population.
	   ``Health and environmental impact assessments worldwide stress
that it is often the poorest and most socio-economically deprived
who experience the greatest impact of adverse public policies.''
	   Selangor delegate Leong Tan Chong suggested that in the future,
retrenchment of bank staff should only be allowed six to eight
months after the completion of any merger exercise.
	   ``The duplication of work and redundancies brought about by
mergers have caused much hardship to staff of financial
institutions.
	   ``This dilemma is partly due to the tight deadline given by Bank
Negara,''
	   he said, adding that rising interest rates had also affected the
livelihood of people in the lower and middle income group.
	   Penang delegate Ooi Siew Kim chided the Chinese for their
``over-involvement in money-making ventures'' and refusal to play
an active part in politics.
	   ``Such a mentality has resulted in the Chinese being unable to
widen their political sphere. The troubles in Indonesia show that
without a strong political grasp, a race can easily be victimised.
With the privilege accorded to us, we should stand united
forever.''
	   Sabah delegate Dr Chang Chau-Lap urged the Government to
encourage the formation of more tertiary educational institutions
in Sabah.
	   ``This will save the education costs incurred by Sabahans as
well as encourage the educated to remain in Sabah. It is frequently
pointed out that students from Sabah who graduate abroad or in the
peninsula, tend to stay there.''

	   ASIAN students in Britain whose funding has been affected by the
economic crisis in the region have been offered a helpline through
an emergency scholarship fund set up by the British authorities.
	   The STG6.6 million (RM37.44 million) fund, managed by the
British Council, will be made available to students from Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
	   ASIAN students in Britain whose funding has been affected by the
economic crisis in the region have been offered a helpline through
an emergency scholarship fund set up by the British authorities.
	   The STG6.6 million (RM37.44 million) fund, managed by the
British Council, will be made available to students from Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
	   The fund is supported by the British Council, the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, British universities and British companies
through the Department of Trade and Industry.
	   British Council Press officer Ruth Brander said it was open to
all students from the five countries already studying in British
institutions of higher education or those joining in the coming
academic year which begins in September.
	   ``They are required to write to their respective British
universities with reference to the scheme. The university will then
decide on the deserving students and forward the application to the
British Council.''
	   The scholarships would be awarded on merit and applicants should
not be on any other scholarship, either local or foreign.
	   This scheme is a one-off offer and only covers the 1998/99
academic year.
	   Successful applicants will be get a STG1,600 for first degree
courses while post-graduate students may get up to STG2,000.
	   The scholarship scheme will come as a blessing for several
British universities whose income is expected to drop substantially
because of the lower enrolment of Asian students.
	   British universities earn about STG300 million a year from
Southeast Asian students.
	   Of the estimated 23,000 Southeast Asian students in the UK,
18,105 are from Malaysia.
	   It was reported that applications from Malaysian students this
year had dropped by 36 per cent.

	   Dr RAHIMAH A. KADIR: Are you taking Wrigley's chewing gums,
Chiclets or bubble gum?
	   All three are actually modern versions of the original tasteless
chewing gum (CG) or chictli made up of milk sap of the Mexican
jungle tree - the sapodilla.
	   It was a favourite of Latin Americans and was introduced into
the United States by an exiled Mexican general - Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna.
	   However, it was photographer cum inventor Thomas Adams who
actually turned it into a commercial investment in 1871. Of the
many types of CGs, Wrigley's peppermint gums appeared to be the
most popular for many decades.
	   The action of chewing gum is said to exercise the jaw muscles
and helps to relieve facial tension which, in turn, can impart a
general feeling of bodily relaxation.
	   In modern dentistry, under the supervision of a dentist,
tasteless chewing gum is often recommended for medically
compromised patients who have problems with saliva production.
	   Misuse or excessive use of chewing gums can, however, pose a
number of oral health problems thus defeating the beneficiary
purpose.
	   For instance, today's gums are mostly prepared with sugar or
artificial sugar. Sugar-flavoured chewing gums can be detrimental
to your teeth if used excessively as it can react with bacterial
plaque and turn your mouth into an acidic environment.
	   The excessive chewing of gum will not allow enough time for the
acidity to be leveled off into a neutral pH. Instead, the oral
environment will be kept at a low acidic pH continuously. This can
also give out a sourish smell and non-stop chewing of CG can also
cause wear and tear of your jaw muscles.
	   I suggest you try and wean off from the habit gradually. You'll
be surprised at how much more attractive you look by keeping that
constant chewing motion at bay.
	   In the meantime you might want to consider substituting the
sweet chewing gums to one that is sugarless. The latter contains
artificial sugar which has been proven to counter or delay acid
production.

	   PETALING JAYA, Mon. - Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk
Mustapa Mohamed said today his ministry had received complaints
that certain franchise holders were only interested in the profits
from franchise fees.
	   Many letters of complaint alleged that franchisers had not given
the assistance which franchisees would need to ensure operations
ran smoothly.
	   The companies who held the franchises, Mustapa said, should help
entrepreneurs who bought or leased the rights.
	   Mustapa saod most of the complaints were directed at companies
in the services industry.
	   Legally, the ministry has no jurisdiction to rule over disputes
between franchisors and franchisees. However, Mustapa said, the
Malaysian Franchise Association had been called in to assist, in
the hope that a solution would be found.
	   Mustapa was speaking at the launch of the first DeliGiant nasi
lemak franchise outlet at Sunway Pyramid in Bandar Sunway today.
DeliGiant Sdn Bhd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Giant TMC Bhd.
	   DeliGiant, incorporated in 1993, will manage all food-related
businesses of the Giant group.
	   It will be the first time that a local product has been
franchised.
	   The outlet is franchised to Norrizah Abdul Rahman, a former
clerk with Bernama.
	   As well as raising her own capital, Norrizah received a RM70,000
loan from the ministry.
	   Also present at the launch was DeliGiant managing director Teng
Yew Huat who said the second franchise outlet would open next week
at the Kuala Lumpur Central Market.

	   THERE has been a refreshing change of cool air blowing in one
corner of the commercial square of SS2 in Petaling Jaya. Two huge
`fans' distributing a light mist of `dew' helps customers at the PJ
Sidewalk Cafe keep their cool in these days of record hot
afternoons.
	   But more than just this, this section of Petaling Jaya is quite
starved of an outlet that offers more than Asian and local cuisine.
And no, we refuse to mention the greasy offerings from fast-food
outlets.
	   The month-old PJ Sidewalk Cafe nicely fills in this gap between
Chinese cuisine, curry fish-head, Thai cooking and hawker fare.
Billed as alfresco dining as well as indoor bistro and cafe and fun
pub, it offers a fusion of flavours of both East and West.
	   Running the show is the team of project manager Sammy Lee,
operations manager Desmond Lun and executive chef Johnny Choo. The
restaurant is located at the perimeter of the noisy business
centre, with its open air dining area facing residential houses. A
huge cream-coloured canopy keeps the sun and rain out while slabs
of clear perspex tones down the buzz of traffic while maintaining
the atmosphere of outdoor dining. Open daily from 10.30 in the
morning till 12 midnight, the main attractions right now are the
food and drinks served with yuppie attitude.
	   Chew and Sharon sip on glasses of ice chocolate with chocolate
ice-cream and chocolate syrup (RM8.50) while I slurp on ice mocha
(RM9). This is really refreshing after the hot drive from the
office. Just remember to stir in the scoop of ice-cream as
otherwise the drink is unsugared.
	   Carbonated drinks, fruit juices, hot drinks and tea are also
available.
	   Main meals are available for lunch and dinner with daily
specials chalked up on the board both inside and outside. But in
between, sandwiches come with a choice of white, grain pita or
foccacia bread and fillings of roast chicken, beef, cheese,
vegetarian, crabmeat and otak- otak as well as tuna, salami,
pastrami, smoked salmon with roasted peppers, onion, mushroom,
sundried tomato, capsicum, olives, capers and even artichoke.
	   Tapas make a good in-between snack as well with items like
seared mussels, eggplant canneloni, deepfried squid, rissoles and
popiah from RM4.80. We had the escargot roll (RM6.80) with a
filling of chopped escargots wrapped in popiah skin and fried to a
golden crisp. It is served on a bed of lettuce and sambal garlic
sauce. I like this much better than the seared scallops (RM6.80)
tossed with harisa sauce and deepfried capers. There is an
overwhelming smell of spices which really does nothing to improve
the fresh scallops. A shame really. I feel fresh scallops need
nothing more than just two minutes of panfrying on both sides to
bring out the sweetness in them.
	   Right now, Sammy says, there are at least 100 items in the menu.
``From customer feedback, we will reassess every three months,
changing certain items and keeping the popular ones,'' says chef
Johnny.
	   As with most late afternoons in the Klang valley, it is pouring
cats and dogs by 6 pm and we are so thankful for the thick canopy
over our heads.
	   The temperature drops and the air takes on a cool note.
	   We are now ready for the selection of pasta. From the nine items
on the menu, we pick spaghetti soto (RM11.80) and seafood capellini
(RM13.80).
	   The latter is fine angel hair pasta in a spicy prawn stock with
plenty of fish, prawns and squid. The sauce is heavily flavoured
with tomato, saffron and other spices. Johnny uses prawn shell as
well as flower crab, simmering these in fish stock to get the
shellfish aroma.
	   Initially, I much prefered this to the spaghetti soto which is
milder in flavour. But somehow, this local touch to an Italian
basic endears by the mouthful. It comes with shredded chicken,
chopped tomato, celery and a liberal dose of chopped chili padi.
Watch out for these lethal bites unless like I, you are a chili
padi fan.
	   Crispy skin salmon (RM18.80) is unusual in that the crispy skin
is reminiscent of salt fish, especially with the far too salty
soy-based sauce that comes with it. It comes with a variety of
salad leaves but is not particularly inspiring.
	   But whatever is lacking in the salmon, Johnny more than makes up
for in his mango chicken (RM14.50). This is an excellent example of
fusion advantage. The well-marinated deboned chicken is panfried
and served on a bed of lettuce and papadum. The sweet, yet mildly
tangy mango sauce poured over provides an excellent foil for both
the chicken and salad and softens the papadum. But no harm done
here.
	   If your tastebuds insist on local, nasi rames (RM16.90) is a
complete meal. Just like nasi lemak, a mound of white rice comes
escorted by a bevy of condiments. There's curry chicken, rendang,
egg with sambal, pickled vegetables, tofu and keropok.
	   Otherwise there's peranakan items like belacan fish, opor ayam,
udang asam goreng and Dutch curry chicken as well as Japanese
choices which we didn't get to try as the chef was out. The Dutch
curry chicken is supposedly made from a traditional recipe and is
served with white rice.
	   It is very lemak and the fragrance of spices, especially serai,
hits you before you even taste it.
	   At the end of the meal, we ask for a cup of short white
(RM4.50), a robust brew which comes with a frothy head. It is
creamy with the full-blown chocolately bouquet of freshly-brewed
coffee - perfect cheering up on a wet evening.

	   NEPLINE Bhd is adopting a more prudent approach in its future
investment plans in tackling the current economic slowdown.
	   This was revealed by the company's executive chairman and chief
executive officer Dr Nik Mohd Zain Omar in its latest annual
report.
	   According to Nik Mohd, the group will slow down its expansion
and concentrate on strengthening its core business as well as
improving cost efficiency through operational restructuring.
	   However, he says the depreciation of the ringgit against the US
dollar does not have much adverse cost implication on the group as
the bulk of its revenues is denominated in US dollars.
	   ``With these measures and given our proven track record, the
group is confident that we will be able to sail out of this
economic downturn and maintain our earnings in 1998,'' Nik Mohd
says.
	   Meanwhile, he says the group's vision to become an integrated
transportation organisation crystallised when it ventured into
providing land transportation services through its subsidiaries,
namely, Nepline Haulage Sdn Bhd and Nepline Carriers Sdn Bhd.
	   Nepline Haulage started operations in March 1997 after securing
a three year contract from Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd while
Nepline Carriers went into operations in April 1997 after securing
a five year contract from Amoco Chemical (M) Sdn Bhd.
	   During the year under review, Nik Mohd adds the group continued
its fleet expansion through the purchase of two more vessels,
namely, MT Melati Sutera and MV Nepline Teratai.
	   Nepline posted a slightly higher group pre-tax profit of RM10.9
million against RM10.81 million the last time around while turnover
grew to RM101.03 million from RM70.30 million previously.
	   After tax profit improved to RM10.87 million from RM10.61
million in 1996 while earnings per share improved to 0.55 sen from
0.53 sen in the previous corresponding period.
	   Directors have recommended a tax exempt dividend of five sen per
share for the year just ended.

	   WHEN children watch us calmly discussing a problem, reasoning
things out, and weighing alternative solutions, they naturally
begin to value and imitate this behaviour.
	   On the other hand, if we become irritable, argumentative,
depressed, or overwhelmed by our problems or if we pretend that the
problems will just go away or take care of themselves, what can we
expect our children to learn?
	   For a variety of psychological reasons, some parents may not
exercise problem-solving skills in the home although they are
capable problem-solvers at work or in the community.
	   Take the case of Daud, a father of three, a pharmacist at a
chain superstore. He works nine- and sometimes 10-hour days. He
also takes courses toward a professional qualification in the hope
that he might one day land a research position with a
pharmaceutical company.
	   Daud is proud of his ability to handle anything that comes his
way at work. He considers himself cool-headed and rational, the man
to call when a problem arises.
	   But at home, he feels that he should have time away from
problems. He tells his wife that he wants his home to be a
sanctuary, a place for resting and recharging his spirit.
	   Thus when he arrives home from work at 6.30pm only to be told
that dinner will be late, he's mad. ``Late! Late again?'' he
exclaims. ``Can't I get my dinner on time once a month?''
	   At dinner, his oldest daughter announces that she got a `C' on a
spelling test.
	   ``Well, if you studied like I told you to,'' he growls, ``you
would have gotten an `A', wouldn't you? Nobody wants to do their
job around here.
	   Everybody takes the easy way. I've got a headache.'' He storms
away from the table.
	   It is a great mystery why we often treat casual acquaintances
and even strangers better than those we love. And yet with effort,
this does not have to be.
	   When parents take responsibility for their roles as leaders in
the family, they provide excellent models for their children. To
them, you are a person with tremendous power - even more than the
prime minister! There are some leadership qualities that parents
need to exhibit in order to maintain happiness and individual
esteem in the family. The following are some of them: You must have
vision, direction, and goals.
	   You must communicate your leadership effectively.
	   You must keep your family focused on the goals.
	   You must consider the needs of others.
	   You must support progress.
	   You must expect success and get it.
	   Do you demonstrate to your child how to solve problems through
your day to day words and actions? Think of a recent problem you
had that affected your family.
	   Were you late paying the bills? Did you have an illness that
kept you from some of your normal activities? Did one of your
children misbehave?
	   Now, using the chart provided, check off the statements that
best describe how you solved the problem.
	   Did you check off more than half of the list? If not, make sure
you read this column next week and we will discuss some practical
tips on how you can implement the above points in problem-solving
situations for your children to learn from.

Sweden defeats Italy 1-0 in warmup

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden defeated Italy 1-0 Tuesday after
a last minute goal by striker Kennet Andersson.
	   Andersson, one of the better players on the Swedish side, headed
a left-wing cross from Andreas Andersson past Italian keeper
Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Italy's coach Cesare Maldini started veteran strikers Roberto
Baggio and Fabrizio Ravanelli. The duo had several chances, but
failed to beat Coventry goalie Magnus Hedman.
	   ``We played fairly well, but were somewhat weak in attack. I
have nothing to regret except the defensive lapse in the final
minute which cost the goal,'' Maldini said.
	   ``Andersson, as usual, proved he's very good in the air. It was
a warmup game, a good chance before the World Cup to experiment.''
	   Ravanelli had Italy's best scoring chance in the 66th minute of
the game, but his shot hit Hedman's left post.
	   Sweden had two good chances in the 55th and the 69th, but
Inter's Pagliuca, who will substitute injured Angelo Perruzzi as
starting keeper, made two easy saves.
	   At times, Milan's defender Paolo Maldini had difficulties
averting Swedish attacks.
	   The first half was lack-luster and slow-paced. Players on both
teams showed signs of hard training and the Italians arrived fresh
from a 10-day-training period at Coverciano near Florence.
	   Lazio's Alessandra Nesta was yellow-carded in the 26th minute
after roughing Bologna striker Kennet Andersson.
	   After the game, Andersson revealed that he had extended his
contract with Bologna.
	   The Swedish striker scored his 30th goal on the national side.
	   Andersson was yellow-carded in the 57th.
	   The warmup at Ullevi Stadium attracted 25,553 spectators.
	   Lineups:
	   Sweden: Magnus Hedman, Roland Nilsson, Patrik Andersson, Joachim
Bjorklund (Morgan Nilsson 45), Pontus Kamark, Stefan Schwartz,
Hakan Mild, Henrik Larsson, Fredrik Soderstrom (Andreas Andersson,
62), Kennet Andersson, Jorgen Pettersson.
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca, Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro
Costacurta (Guiseppe Bergomi, 73), Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini,
Angelo Di Livio (Francesco Moriero, 45), Demetrio Albertini, Luigi
Di Biagio, Roberto Di Matteo (Gianluca Pessotto, 84), Fabrizio
Ravanelli, Roberto Baggio.

	   IT all started when Bobbi Brown could not find cosmetic shades
and textures she liked. As a make-up artist for fashion shows (in
the US) and a working mother of two young sons, Bobbi realised this
was going to be a real problem.
	   She firmly believed that ``make-up is about being yourself and
wearing the colours that work for you'' but no matter how much
cosmetics she carried, she always ended up mixing and blending key
shades to produce the desired effect.
	   What she needed was an easy-to-use, carefully edited range of
make-up that contained only truly flattering natural shades.
	   Using her contacts in the industry, Bobbi soon had the shades
she needed specially made for her. But when she started using them
on the models, they asked her if they could keep the make-up for
themselves.
	   Thus marked the beginning of Bobbi Brown Essentials which is now
a national and international phenomenon (in the USA and more
recently in Canada, Britain and Germany).
	   Bobbi realised that if her new make-up was perfect for her, it
would be perfect for other women too and so, together with partner
Rosalind Landis, she launched her first range of Bobbi Brown
Essentials - a handful of lipstick colours, sold only in an
up-market department store. From such small beginnings six years
ago, Bobbi Brown Essentials has evolved into a complete range of
ultra-wearable professional quality cosmetics, make-up tools and
skincare.
	   ``Bobbi is a down-to earth approachable person who created a
pared down, simple concept - wearable colours that make it easy for
women to look their best,'' says Alyssa Knox, a trainer cum make-up
artist with Bobby Brown Professional Cosmetics, International,
based in California.
	   ``Hers is a `less is more' philosophy. Look at her fascinating
range of eye-shadows - they fall mainly in neutral territory and
are so wearable,''
	   adds Knox who has nine years of experience in this line.
	   ``Even her lipsticks are so natural that they surprisingly look
like the colour of real lips. Her lipsticks bring out the colour of
our lips.
	   ``The skin already has colour and what Bobbi Brown does is to
bring out one's natural skintone. She believes that for most women,
there simply aren't hundreds of different shades that suit them -
just a few key shades that are based on their own natural skintone.
	   ``It does not mean that just because we emphasise on the word
natural, you see lots of browns in the range. On the contrary there
are many wonderful, bright shades to choose from.''
	   Being constantly in touch with the latest in the industry,
(Bobbi still does make-up for models in fashion shows), she is a
veritable wealth of knowledge and in many instances, is able to
pass on this knowledge in the form of her products to her
customers.
	   Knox says that one of Bobbi's favourite shades is the soft pink
for the blush.
	   ``Blush is her favourite cosmetic. If she could apply only one
cosmetic item, she would choose a blush,'' adds Alyssa. And among
her favourite lipsticks is the No. 4. With Bobbi Brown Essentials,
when a woman walks into a room, you notice her, not the make-up she
wears.
	   ``Her foundation is of a revolutionary technology. Her range
includes foundation sticks in 10 yellow-based shades to suit all
skin tones. This unique alternative to traditional liquid
foundations gives a light, even natural looking finish when applied
only to areas that need coverage, e.g.
	   under-eye circles, colour unevenness and blemishes. It also has
oil-free and moisturising foundations.
	   ``She does not believe in translucent powder as she feels it
makes the skin look grey,'' says Knox. But her cosmetics collection
includes loose powders and pressed powder, bronzing sticks and
bronzing powders.
	   Eight custom-designed blushers specifically created to
complement and enhance the natural skin tone has a superb matte
formula for smooth and even application and which creates the
perfect warm, healthy looking natural blush colour.
	   The eyes have it all with a perfect palette of 18 ultra wearable
eye-shadows and shimmer eye-shadows in three wearable subtle
cream-based shades to suit all skin tones.
	   Lip colours abound in this collection with numerous hues of
wearable shades that add glamour and charm. Lip pencils are
designed to complement the lipstick range and is of an exclusive
formula soft enough to glide on smoothly and can even be used alone
to fill in the lips for a totally matte effect or even to add
definition when worn with lipstick. Lip gloss with long-lasting
shine in three sensuous shades, is matched, with a custom designed
brush for expert application to ensure lipstick remains intact.
	   Bobbi does not believe in discontinuing shades. Since the day it
was launched, every single item is still available.
	   Together with its purposeful range of eye pencils, mascara and
thickening mascara, this range is irresistible. Bobbi Brown is also
well known for its ultimate collection of 12 hand-crafted brushes
designed for professional make-up application which offer
unrivalled control, ease of application and a precision finish.
	   Bobbi Brown Essentials was launched at Isetan, KLCC on March 30.
Prices range from RM55. Although highly successful with her
cosmetics range, Bobbi continues to work as an active-make-up
artist for famous celebrities and models.
	   Constantly in demand by top fashion houses, she creates the
make-up looks for leading cover girls and can name famous faces
like Amber Valetta, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss,
Tina Turner, Lauren Hutton and others in her list.
	   She entered the industry more than 16 years ago with a degree in
theatrical make-up. Seven years later, she landed her first Vogue
cover shoot, three years ahead of her personal goal. But success
has not changed Bobbi who believes in priorities, her family coming
before everything else. She says a very supportive family has been
a key factor in her success. Her husband Steven Plofker helps her
with the business part of her company.
	   With success came regular appearances on television shows
including the Oprah Winfrey talk show. She soon became a leading
authority on make-up, advising and inspiring women to find and
express their own personal style.
	   Brown recently launched her own Internet site which attracts
thousands of contacts a month and has also just finished a new
make-up advice book.

Court acquits owner of collapsed Cairo building 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo court Tuesday acquitted on
technicality a landlord convicted of manslaughter in the 1996
collapse of his 12-story building that killed 64 residents.
	   The Court of Cassation rejected a High Security court ruling
last year, which found Raouf Wissa Ibrahim, 60, guilty of illegally
adding four floors atop an eight-story building. Prosecutors said
the additional weight caused the building to buckle under.
	   Ibrahim was sentenced to seven years in jail, but wasn't
imprisoned pending his appeal.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the Cassation Court ruled
that Ibrahim was not liable since he had already been tried for
adding the extra floors in 1977 when he was fined and given a
suspended jail sentence.
	   It was not known if the Cassation Court put the blame on
authorities for not demolishing the four floors.
	   The Court also reversed a ruling against two engineers and
ordered their retrial in another court.
	   The engineers were also sentenced by the High Security court to
three years imprisonment, and fined 325,396 Egyptian pounds (dlrs
95,000) for negligence. They were accused of removing columns and
supporting walls on the ground floor to make room for a bank.
	   The building collapse in the upscale Heliopolis district in
Cairo sparked calls for tougher construction laws and stricter
punishments for shoddy building practices, which became rampant in
the 1970s because of rising real estate prices.

	   COMPUTER Systems Advisers (M) Bhd (CSA) will continue to focus
on its electronic commerce internet solutions business as it
anticipates an increased awareness of these solutions in the
domestic market.
	   Thus CSA will work aggressively to position itself as the
preferred vendor for the early proponents of MSC developments by
offering companies effective solutions and IT services.
	   Chairman Tan Sri Dr Mohd Rashdan Baba in his latest annual
statement says that the group's MSC status subsidiary also plans to
introduce additional solutions and increase its potential revenue
with systems integration projects in the years ahead.
	   During the year under review, the company's effort to export
solutions and its relationship banking systems application made
further inroads when it managed to get a financial institution in
Singapore as a customer.
	   Its customer services and support business also had a successful
year as it managed to secure a number of major contracts from
end-users and vendors.
	   Meanwhile, for the financial year ended December 31 1997, the
group's pre-tax profit rose 25.2 per cent to RM19.32 million from
RM15.42 million the last time around while turnover grew 38.4 per
cent to RM370.01 million from RM267.40 million previously.
	   After-tax profit for the year improved to RM13.24 million from
RM10.87 million in 1996 but earnings per share fell to 0.39 sen
from 10.56 sen previously.
	   Shareholders' fund grew to RM75.8 million from RM39.9 million in
the previous financial year.

Talks under way in Air France pilots' strike 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Wednesday flights, talks could last overnight

By IAN PHILLIPS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top brass at Air France sat down with striking
pilots' unions Tuesday in an attempt to keep the World Cup from
becoming a no-show event for thousands of fans.
	   The walkout at the World Cup's official airline, in its second
day, was already causing scheduling nightmares for teams preparing
for the soccer championship that begins June 10.
	   The president of the state-owned airline, Jean-Cyril Spinetta,
was among officials who opened talks at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) with the
unions representing 3,200 pilots, at the company's headquarters at
Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris.
	   More than 4 1/2 hours later, talks were still under way, with
officials on both sides saying privately the meeting could last
well into the night and resume Wednesday.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   An Air France source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the airline would stand firm on 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in annual salary cuts, but that it could eventually drop
its two-tier scale paying a lower salary to new pilots.
	   In an interview published Tuesday, Spinetta said there was
``still a lot of work to do'' to settle the salary dispute with the
pilots and suggested postponing talks until after the World Cup
ends July 12.
	   ``Putting off the talks until the summer is absolutely
conceivable,'' Spinetta told the daily Le Parisien.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike, which was forcing tens of
thousands of people worldwide to look for other ways to travel.
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   At Charles de Gaulle airport, a shop employee sat alone Tuesday
in an empty store stocked with World Cup insignia. Opposite was a
newspaper stall where headlines read: ``World Cup held hostage,''
and ``World Cup in peril.''
	   After walking 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Paris to Chartres
over the weekend with 10,000 other youths on a pilgrimage, Ellen
Kerry was trying to get to New York on an Air France flight.
	   ``We only found out when we got in the taxi that there was a
strike. We could have saved the money and walked,'' said Kerry,
whose home is in Virginia.
	   At Marseille's Marignane Airport, passenger Pierre-Antoine
Graziani was getting fed up waiting to get on a waiting list to fly
to Paris.
	   ``I'm told something different from one hour to another,'' he
said. ``I might take my chances with the TGV,'' the high-speed
French train.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   But the U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday,
said it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines,
connecting to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses in France.
	   Former French player Michel Platini, co-president of the World
Cup organizing committee, accused the pilots Tuesday of ``taking
the country hostage. ... This is the image of France at stake, not
necessarily that of an airline.''

	   HE has been a police sergeant and a tapioca farmer, among other
occupations. He has also worked in the British Royal Air Force in
Singapore, wrote background music for the film industry in India, a
band leader in Sabah and is now an accomplished pianist out to woo
listeners to his special blend of music - a mix of western
percussion and the native sounds of ethnic groups in Sabah.
	   Hailed as the `Father of Sabah Music', Peter Pragas' love affair
with the piano began during his childhood days in Penang. At the
age of seven, his father, Anthony Pragasam initiated his first
attempt on the piano keys.
	   Together with eight other siblings, Pragas grew up with music in
the house. But he was the only one who has pursued it with a
passion born of a natural bent, and a keen ear for music.
	   A chance meeting with two renowned musicians - Professor Hoffman
from Germany and Professor Arulde from India - when he was 12 years
old led to professional coaching for Pragas in the art of piano and
violin.
	   In later years, he completed his Grade Eight in the external
course of the Trinity College of Music.
	   Pragas recalls playing the organ in church, on the days that his
father could not make it, as his first introduction to a public
audience.
	   ``My dad was the organist in our church. But being an editor
with a local daily, there were times he worked night shifts, and
couldn't play in church, so I would replace him,'' the 72-year old
recollects.
	   The Japanese Occupation of Malaya saw him taking up arms in the
police force as sergeant, a role he eventually relinquished to opt
instead for planting tapioca in Nibong Tebal.
	   When the war over, he went back to school, completed his Senior
Cambridge, and left for Singapore to join the Royal Air Force in
the administrative department.
	   But he was restless, needing an outlet for his creative side.
	   Finally, Pragas went to India (to quote him) ``with star dust in
his eyes'' to seek his destiny. He was in his 20s, enthusiastic and
eager to assimilate experiences in the music industry.
	   India proved to be the turning point in his quest for further
knowledge in Eastern/Carnatic (classical) music.
	   For the next four years, he worked as a freelance assistant
music director at Gemini Studios and in Bombay theatres.
	   ``It wasn't easy. I had to learn the notations of Eastern music.
Dad had taught me to read music notes of the gregorian chants,
which means latin church music. But this is different from modern
music notes, and in India, I learned different notes again,'' he
says.
	   After India, he came back to Kuala Lumpur, because he ``had
learned enough''. He joined Film Unit (now known as Filem Negara)
as director of music.
	   In 1957, during a visit to Borneo, he fell in love with
Jesselton, now known as Kota Kinabalu. A year later, he joined RTM
Sabah, and set up a band called the ``Se-renaders''.
	   ``There was no proper band at that time to promote local music.
We entertained people in the interior, the suburban and the urban
areas of Sabah,'' he reminisces.
	   The intriguing sounds of Sabah enticed him to stay, and in 1959
he married Helen Chung, who is of Chinese Kadazandusun descent.
	   The couple settled in Kota Kinabalu. Three fully grown
offsprings later - namely Adrian, Sandra and Jeanette - Pragas is
still inspired by Sabah.
	   ``I'm still learning about the music of the place, and the
intriguing sounds that you get when you blend piano and local
traditional instruments together,'' he enthuses.
	   He recalls the pride he felt when EMI launched his album
entitled Land Below The Wind in 1979. In 1981, Pragas was asked by
the Sabah government to produce a set of cultural albums in
conjunction with the state's Centennial Celebration.
	   The collection, entitled Sabah Centennial Celebration, comprises
one album of recorded native traditional music and an album of
popular songs favoured by the people of Sabah at that point in
time. This momento is being exhibited at the state museum in Kota
Kinabalu.
	   For his contributions to Sabah, Pragas was confered the Ahli
Setia Darjah Kinabalu Award in 1993.
	   After retiring from public service, Pragas concentrated on his
music, releasing Mystical Malaysia in 1987, and Kyrie Elesion in
1989. Another project is Memories from Sabah, which incorporates
compositions in Kadazan, Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and English.
	   In this collection, Pragas has blended piano melodies with the
sounds of traditional instruments like the sompoton (a number of
flutes joined together), the turali (nose flute) and the bungkau
which resembles a Jews harp made of bamboo.
	   His most recent project, released last month, is Greetings from
Sabah which incorporates the sounds of piano, sompoton, bungkau,
turali, ukelele, accordion and tambourine.
	   Today, Pragas still plays at the Shangri-La and Hyatt hotels in
Sabah, as well as at the beach resort in Kinarut. He likens his
love for the piano to a love for orchestra, because as he says, one
can produce full harmony and orchestral sounds on a piano, unlike
some instruments which can only produce melodies.
	   ``I modify slightly the sompoton to suit western scales, but the
bungkau needs no modification,'' he explains when asked about the
way to blend the music.
	   Of his three children, only Jeanette has followed in his
footsteps. She teaches music in Sabah. Adrian is a civil engineer
based in Brunei while Sandra is an educationist in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Music is a good legacy to leave behind, not just to one's
children but to future generations. I cannot get bored with music.
There are so many things to learn about the music industry, or for
that matter, any industry. There's just no end to learning,'' he
concludes.

	   IT'S happened, and much sooner than I had expected, too. Despite
endless parental pleading to take it easy and personal vows never
to sink so low, I've become the typical Malaysian driver of
reckless renown.
	   I motored hesitantly onto the roads for the first time less than
six months ago and spent the initial period minding my road p's and
q's, anxious not to provoke anybody into muscling my tiny Kancil
into the longkang.
	   The priorities then were clear - let people cut in front if they
want.
	   Let them toddle in front at a Sunday-drive-like 30km/hr. Let
them shower you with abusive language. Just get to wherever you
want to go in one piece without getting lost.
	   But the constant frustration of being bullied, sideswiped and
honked at was simply too much. Gandhi himself would have eventually
abandoned his non-violence stance and lost his temper. Which I
meant I did exactly that almost immediately.
	   My speedometre has been breaking new ground lately, which I
first noticed the day I spotted my mother's white-knuckled grip on
her seat.
	   I've also stopped rolling over and playing dead the minute a
bigger car challenges me. It happens often, probably because with
the ``P'' sticker on my windshield and the Lillputian size of the
car, I might as well be carrying a ``Kick Me'' neon sign around.
	   It's funny how bigger, luxury car drivers act all outraged if a
smaller car dares to put up any resistance. They glare with a ``How
dare you?!''
	   glint in their eye as you niftily move your way past.
	   One guy nearly had a apoplectic fit when I refused to let him
cut in front me, and promptly tried to barrel into my lane the
minute we hit the highway.
	   Godzilla may now be in the theatres preaching ``Size does
matter!'' but a pinch of foolhardy stubbornness can level the
playing field for smaller cars.
	   The exceptions to the rule are the truly huge vehicles - buses,
construction trucks - that often clog our roads. Going head to head
with any of these mammoths isn't asserting your right, it's being
stupid.
	   Luxury car drivers, however, are a different class. Their
driving often suggests that they believe the money they plonked
down for their pricey imports entitles them to a bigger share of
the road.
	   They don't seem to fully realise that it's only earned them a
migraine- inducing payment plan, which is why I've been thinking
about having a car bumper sticker made up: ``I'm making my car
payments just fine, how about you?''
	   Now, being Asian, I'm getting the sneaking suspicion that all
this bragging of on-the-road bravado is going to tempt the fates to
screw up my karma, or whatever you want to call it, and land me
into trouble.
	   So let me explain this: I'm a responsible driver. Most of us
Kancil drivers are actually, because we're mindful of our size. But
we're also defensive about it and won't take any strong-arm tactics
without biting back.
	   Yes we're small, but we're also nimble. And you know what? In a
city where public parking is as rare as a Yeti sighting, guess
who'll be able to squeeze into the tiny spaces?

Four survivors of Antarctic crash need medicine, outside help 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four Russians seriously injured in a helicopter
crash in Antarctica are being treated on a Russian ship that has
only one day's supply of medicine, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The injured need to be taken to the nearest port, Cape Town,
South Africa, for more sophisticated medical care, but that is a
10-day voyage, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A MI-8 helicopter with nine people on board crashed Monday, 15
minutes after taking off from the research vessel Academician
Fyodorov and shortly before reaching its destination, the Russian
Antarctic station Novolazarevskaya.
	   Five people died, and four _ two mechanics, a doctor and a polar
explorer _ were seriously injured.
	   ITAR-Tass said officials on the Academician Fyodorov were trying
to get more medicine from the Russian and Indian polar stations.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) traded sharply
lower across the board yesterday on concerns of the country's
shrinking economic growth in the first quarter of the year.
	   Analysts said market players were seen reacting to the concerns
of a recession, if the country's economic growth for the second
quarter does not trend into positive territory.
	   Some forced selling of blue-chips added to the prevailing
bearish market sentiment on the bourse, pushing the key barometer
down by nearly 4 per cent at the close.
	   Analysts added, the slide in regional bourses also had a strong
influence on the KLSE causing continued selling pressure and lack
of buying interest as players found with little or no reason to
support the market.
	   Amid lingering concerns of the slowing economy locally and
regionally, shares are seen to be mixed throughout the week, said
dealers.
	   The KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) was down 20.24 points to 518.00
compared with last Friday's close of 538.24.
	   The KLSE's Second Board closed 1.64 points lower to 109.83 while
the broader Emas Index lost 4.26 points to close at 132.25.
	   The scoreboard showed losers outpacing gainers 511 to 95 with
126 counters remaining unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries lost 4.01 points to 125.59 while
the 30-share New Straits Industrial Index eased 67.14 points to
close at 3,068.98.
	   On the KLSE yesterday, total turnover amounted to 120.033
million shares valued at RM236.152 billion yesterday compared with
127.625 million shares valued at RM277.763 billion traded last
Friday.
	   Maybank was the most active counter with 14.69 million shares,
followed by Berjaya Singer Bhd-TSRs with 9.30 million and MBf
Capital with 6.0 million shares changing hands.

Quake survivor reaches village too late to help With Afghanistan-Quake 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ By the time Mohammad Karim reached
his village, nearly everyone was dead. All that was left was to
pull bodies from the earthquake debris and bury them quickly,
without even a prayer.
	   Karim, a rugged-looking farmer in his mid-30s, was 50 kilometers
(30 miles) away in Faisabad when the earth heaved in a violent jolt
that devastated scores of villages like Chawgani, where he lived.
	   With four friends, Karim hitched a ride, then walked to
Chawgani. They found little left standing.
	   ``We started digging. When we brought the people out they were
already dead. One of them was my cousin who was married two months
ago. He was lying next to his wife,'' said Karim.
	   All the members of two families related to Karim were wiped out
in the quake, he said _ more than a dozen people. Few in the
village of about 200 survived.
	   ``We brought the bodies from under the destruction and buried
them without an Islamic prayer. We didn't have time,'' he said.
	   Survivors, most of them suffering broken bones, face shortages
of food, clean water and medicine.
	   Karim said most of the people in Faisabad, the provincial
capital of Badakhshan province, lost relatives in the quake.
	   Look around, he advised a reporter. ``You cannot find a smile on
any face.''

	   FOR many, ``transparency'' refers to the clear sheet of plastic
used for presentations with overhead projectors. That however, is
not the ``transparency'' we will be addressing.
	   For the last few months you would have noticed that transparency
has been hotly discussed. Notwithstanding this, people are still
unsure about it, or more importantly what good it is to them.
	   We will look at what transparency is, followed by the global and
domestic implications. We will end it off with the crucial aspects
of how transparency affects the everyday investor and how it can
benefit you in investment decisions.
	   One definition of ``transparent'' is ``something that is easily
seen through or easily understood''. An alternative might be ``a
thing or service is transparent when you know what is in it, or how
it really works''.
	   In other words you are not in the dark. The concept stands for
putting everything on the table for everyone to see. Other than
trade secrets such as the special recipe for Kentucky Fried
Chicken, the consumer has a right to know.
	   Global
	   THERE is a definite trend towards greater transparency on a
global level as the number of businesses operating in more than one
country continues to grow. Typically developed nations operate with
a relatively high degree of transparency and expect the same when
doing business in other parts of the world. In order for businesses
to interact and operate across borders, they have to be able to
understand each other.
	   In Penang there is a high-technology centre manufacturing a
variety of goods, not to mention personal computers. Factories
there actually import some of the parts to manufacture the
computers.
	   When a computer maker imports, it wants to know every detail
about the goods that it is getting, down to the finest points. If
the part can affect the finished product, it wants to know.
	   If the supplier of the goods were to say ``just take the product
and don't ask so many questions'', chances are the computer maker
would go to another supplier.
	   Domestic
	   THERE have been many calls for increased transparency in
Malaysia especially in the financial sector. As is the case
anywhere in the world, an economy does not become transparent
overnight; it is part of the development process.
	   From a global standpoint increasing transparency will make
Malaysia more attractive to foreign investors over the long-term.
With the current regional economic crisis, the demand for
information is greater than ever.
	   It is ironic that it takes a downturn to increase the need for
information. In the boom times people are more liberal, and they do
not want to know quite as much. In fact, the drive for information
should be strong all the time, not just during a downturn.
	   The most recent example of the need for a high level of
transparency is the newly-formed Asset Management Company. The
authorities and analysts have already said the AMC must be
exceptionally transparent to be a successful venture.
	   Man On
	   The Street MOST of us are not manufacturing personal computers
or selling non- performing loans, so does transparency really mean
anything to the average investor? Actually, it means a lot! Now,
more than ever, you need to know exactly what is involved in any
potential investment.
	   You will find that for the same investment some companies
provide substantially more information than others. The more
information you can get about a potential investment, the better.
	   If you are not able to get all the information you want, you had
better be asking yourself why. If there is nothing to hide why not
be completely transparent?
	   The trend towards greater transparency is definitely in favour
of the individual investor. In essence, it allows the individual to
see the situation in a better light.
	   When it comes to investments there are some basics that you
should look out for on transparency. It makes good sense to know
all the fees or costs associated with the investment. If they seem
hidden or in ``extra'' small print you should be asking yourself
why they aren't made easy to understand.
	   Next, you want to check what protection you will have. For
instance, are there investment restrictions so that your interests
are safeguarded and you will know where your money is going?
	   Lastly, look for the investment to very clearly spell out any
potential risks associated with it. Nothing comes free and the
companies should tell the investors up front what it is going to
cost, in all respects.
	   But the investor also has a role to play in the development. The
investor has to be very demanding in two respects.
	   First, you have to demand more information from companies that
you are investing in or considering. It is as a result of this
demand that the companies will start to supply the information the
investing public wants.
	   Second, if you are not getting the necessary information do not
invest in the product. With the lack of demand for the product the
company will get the hint very quickly that it has to meet
potential investors' needs.
	   If investors continue to give business to companies which do not
have transparent policies there is no reason for them to change.
	   At the end of the day, transparency benefits everyone, except
those who have something to hide. As an investor, it will
definitely benefit you in the short- and long-term.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Water supply to areas affected by the
current rationing exercise may be reduced should the levels at two
supply dams continue to recede.
	   Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said today water cuts
could be extended to areas receiving water from the Semenyih and
Langat dams if there was no rain for three to four days.
	   Currently, water is supplied for 12 hours on alternate days to
702 affected areas in Selangor and Federal Territory. The rationing
exercise began on March 27.
	   Meanwhile, Selangor Waterworks Deparment deputy director-general
V.
	   Subramaniam said the measure would be discussed at the Selangor
State Exco meeting on Wednesday.
	   He said the department was studying the the effects of further
cuts to consumers.Cuts of up to two days was a possiblity.
	   A department statement today showed that water levels at the
Semenyih and Langat dams had dropped by 0.07m and 0.06m
respectively today to 99.63m and 205.46m, while the level at the
Klang Gates dam also dipped by 0.16m.
	   The water level at the Klang Gates dam was 5.80m above the
critical point at 89.80m.

Sweden defeats Italy 1-0 in warmup

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden defeated Italy 1-0 Tuesday after
a last minute goal by striker Kennet Andersson.
	   Andersson, one of the better players on the Swedish side, headed
a left-wing cross from Andreas Andersson past Italian keeper
Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Italy's coach Cesare Maldini started veteran strikers Roberto
Baggio and Fabrizio Ravanelli. The duo had several chances, but
failed to beat Coventry goalie Magnus Hedman.
	   ``We played fairly well, but were somewhat weak in attack. I
have nothing to regret except the defensive lapse in the final
minute which cost the goal,'' Maldini said.
	   ``Andersson, as usual, proved he's very good in the air. It was
a warmup game, a good chance before the World Cup to experiment.''
	   Ravanelli had Italy's best scoring chance in the 66th minute of
the game, but his shot hit Hedman's left post.
	   Sweden had two good chances in the 55th and the 69th, but
Inter's Pagliuca, who will substitute injured Angelo Perruzzi as
starting keeper, made two easy saves.
	   At times, Milan's defender Paolo Maldini had difficulties
averting Swedish attacks.
	   The first half was lack-luster and slow-paced. Players on both
teams showed signs of hard training and the Italians arrived fresh
from a 10-day-training period at Coverciano near Florence.
	   Lazio's Alessandra Nesta was yellow-carded in the 26th minute
after roughing Bologna striker Kennet Andersson.
	   After the game, Andersson revealed that he had extended his
contract with Bologna.
	   The Swedish striker scored his 30th goal on the national side.
	   Andersson was yellow-carded in the 57th.
	   The warmup at Ullevi Stadium attracted 25,553 spectators.
	   Lineups:
	   Sweden: Magnus Hedman, Roland Nilsson, Patrik Andersson, Joachim
Bjorklund (Morgan Nilsson 45), Pontus Kamark, Stefan Schwartz,
Hakan Mild, Henrik Larsson, Fredrik Soderstrom (Andreas Andersson,
62), Kennet Andersson, Jorgen Pettersson.
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca, Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro
Costacurta (Guiseppe Bergomi, 73), Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini,
Angelo Di Livio (Francesco Moriero, 45), Demetrio Albertini, Luigi
Di Biagio, Roberto Di Matteo (Gianluca Pessotto, 84), Fabrizio
Ravanelli, Roberto Baggio.

	   ALL eyes of the international eco-tourism fraternity are trained
on Pulau Kukup, a mangrove island one kilometre off the
south-western tip of Johor.
	   Pulau Kukup, reputed to be the world's largest mangrove island,
will soon be on the world eco-tourism map as the country's second
permanent wetlands site.
	   Tasik Bera in Pahang is the first.
	   The Johor Government has engaged Wetlands International
Asia-Pacific to undertake a detailed study to support its
application for permanent wetland status for the island.
	   Pulau Kukup is unique for its extensive open mudflat area.
Mudflats serve as an important stopover and feeding ground for
migratory birds, due to the presence of mollusc species such as
crabs, snails, shrimps and worms.
	   These represent a food source for many birds. About 450 kinds of
birds, including five shorebird species, have been identified on
the island.
	   The island is also a breeding ground for the Lesser Adjutant
Stork (Leptotilus Javanicus) which is listed as vulnerable in the
Red List of Threatened Animals.
	   Reptilian, amphibian and mammalian species also live in the
island's mangrove forest. A huge population of wild pigs, monkeys,
snakes and fish, including a variety of the mud skipper which
measures more than 50 centimetres in length, abound.
	   Johor Environment and Consumer Affairs Committee chairman Dr
Chua Soi Lek said the 1,298-hectare island, including 650ha of
mudflats, was now under the Johor National Parks Corporation.
	   Dr Chua is the technical chairman of the corporation which has
the distinction of managing Johor's national parks, unlike other
States where national park areas are run by the Federal authority.
	   He said the island which was gazetted as a national park in 1996
had been divided into four zones - the mudflats, coastal mangrove
area, slightly elevated ground in the interior where the Rhizophora
apiculata mangrove trees grow, reaching heights of up to 25 metres,
and the central region of mixed vegetation including nipah and
undergrowth.
	   The coastal area can be broken into three distinct mangrove
areas: the north-eastern and south-eastern zones where the 10-metre
Rhizophora apiculata mangrove trees grow, the north-west with its
20-metre Sonneratia alba trees, and the south-east with a mixture
of Avicennia intermedia, Avicennia alba and Rhizophora apiculata.
	   There are two stretches of coast comprising eroded banks of
about a metre high which are backed by the Rhizophora apiculata and
Bruguiera gymnorhiza mangrove species.
	   He said other species found on the island are the Rhizophora
mucronata and Bruguiera cylindrica.
	   Studies have shown that clear-felling of mangrove trees on Pulau
Kukup when it was managed by the State Forestry Department before
being gazetted as a national park, had changed its natural mangrove
composition.
	   The State Government's decision to gazette the island as a
national park is a positive effort towards protecting and enhancing
the mangrove habitat, which is threatened by development, pollution
and reclamation activities.
	   Pulau Kukup has suffered from unplanned reclamation and
development of the Kukup waterfront villages by fishermen.
	   The villages with about 200 illegal houses built on reclaimed
mangrove swamp land, are not within the Pontian District Council's
jurisdiction.
	   Thus, it's without a proper waste disposal system and residents
dump their garbage into the sea, causing serious pollution.
	   Another source of pollution is the 70 fish farms cradled in the
sheltered waters between the Kukup shoreline and Pulau Kukup.
	   The island is also hit by ships dumping sludge and numerous oil
slicks.
	   Yet Pulau Kukup retains much of its natural charm. During high
tide, it is submerged except for 40 per cent of the forest canopy,
causing the trees to appear to be ``floating'' in the sea.
	   During low tide, the mudflats surrounding the island are totally
exposed.
	   Dr Chua said in its quest for permanent wetland status, the
island enjoys the advantage of a strategic location along the path
of migratory birds.
	   ``A variety of large and small birds including the Chinese
Harrot and Green Harrot fly about 5,000km from China and Siberia to
the island.
	   ``Bird enthusiasts can view these birds nesting on the island
between September and April.''
	   Dr Chua said in anticipation of an eco-tourist influx, the State
Government will spend RM1.3 million to build infrastructure such as
a jetty, walkway, bird watching tower and fishing facilities.
	   He said existing chalets run by Kukup fishermen would be
upgraded.
	   Facilities are also being planned for visitors on educational or
scientific research trips.
	   Though necessary, it's hoped that such development will not
diminish the island's natural charms.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The head of the U.N. refugee
agency began talks Tuesday in Sierra Leone on repatriating a
half-million refugees to this battle-scarred West African country.
	   UNHCR director Soren Jessen-Petersen flew into Sierra Leone's
capital of Freetown late Monday for meetings with President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah and other government officials before leaving on
Wednesday.
	   Discussions focused on the problem of repatriating 530,000
Sierra Leoneans who have fled the country since 1991, UNHCR
officials said.
	   Most of the emigrees have sought refuge in neighboring Guinea,
Liberia and the Gambia.
	   Jessen-Petersen said UNHCR had launched an urgent appeal for
dlrs 7.3 million to give emergency assistance to thousands of
refugees who fled Sierra Leone since January this year.
	   ``We are talking about life and death and the need for refugees
to survive,'' Jessen-Petersen said, estimating that possibly
thousands were in need of food aid.
	   So far, the United States had pledge dlrs one million to the
problem, he added.
	   A 1991-96 rebel war in Sierra Leone triggered an exodus of some
380,000 refugees from the country. A further 150,000 are believed
to have fled since May last year when Kabbah's government was
ousted by troops loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma.
	   After spending months in exile, Kabbah was restored to power by
a Nigerian-led West African intervention force in March.

	   ANALYSTS concur that the steps taken by Malaysian Airline System
Bhd (MAS) to sell, lease and defer delivery of aircraft are
positive for the long term.
	   However, even with the deferment, analysts expressed concerns
over funding costs when delivery of new aircraft eventually begins
in the year 2000.
	   One analyst pointed out that the overall load factor of MAS is
currently 60 per cent. This means that only 60 per cent of the
company's aircraft is being used.
	   ``With the extra capacity, the national carrier should focus on
saving costs,'' said the analyst.
	   She said that sluggish demand for air travel in Asia at present
has forced other Asian airlines to slash airfares. With such
competition, MAS will have to be more efficient, the analyst added.
	   The sale and leaseback arrangements for some of MAS' aircraft
are timely, another analyst said. This should be done in order for
the group to repay some of its debts.
	   Net borrowings for MAS currently stand at some RM11 billion, the
analyst said.
	   ``A huge problem for the group is that over 90 per cent of the
loans was secured with floating interest rates and these rates are
now in double digits,'' the analyst commented.
	   The analyst agreed that the delay in aircraft delivery will ease
some cost pressures on MAS. However, he said the group should have
obtained a longer time extension.
	   Analysts contacted by Business Times gave mixed opinions on
factors which had adversely affected the national carrier. Most of
them, however, agreed that exposure to foreign debts is a large
concern.
	   ``Unlike Singapore Airlines which uses cash to purchase
aircraft, MAS borrows since there is a limited amount of disposable
income that it can lure,'' one analyst said.
	   Another analyst mentioned that fuel costs are expected to be
higher with the fall in the ringgit.
	   Even though fuel prices dropped by 15 per cent, total fuel cost
incurred by MAS was RM215 million for the year ended March 31 1998,
which was attributed largely to the weak currency.
	   However, one analyst contended that weak regional demand for air
travel will be the bane for MAS in the current financial year.
``With depressed currencies and less disposable income, Asians are
not likely to travel more,'' the analyst said.
	   However, the analyst added, the currency depreciation is also a
blessing for MAS as more foreign tourists are enticed to visit
Malaysia as they get more value for their money.

	   LESS than a year ago, when the economic slowdown started, three
entrepreneurs joined forces to embark on an uncharted course.
	   To track down advertisements, monitor them and offer the
compilations to clients to keep them in touch with what was going
on in the marketplace.
	   Today, MediaBanc has a staff of six and business is growing. I
asked General Manager Alan Lim the story.
	   S: What are MediaBanc's core activities?
	   L: They fall into two areas. One is our Advertisement Library of
all television, radio and print advertisements which we have
monitored.
	   These are categorised by brands, industry, language, duration
and the month the ad was launched plus a title or file name for
each entry.
	   For example, you can make a request for two chosen brands of
toothpaste ads which appeared in the last six months and if you
require the commercials in English only.
	   The second area we are active in is news monitoring. Based on
standing instructions or on an ad-hoc request basis, we can monitor
your news, your competitors' news or even your industry news when
it appears over television, on radio and in the newspapers.
	   This service also covers monitoring the TV and Radio programme
which you sponsored to make sure that it appeared as promised or
just to keep a copy of the programme for future reference.
	   Additionally, we do media schedule monitoring where the ad
agency or client will provide us a copy of the booked media
schedule and we'll make sure they appear as scheduled.
	   S: Do you use computers in tracking all the advertisements?
	   L: I would say that without the computer, we would not be able
to have an efficient library! The requirements of every client are
always different.
	   Our ads are digitised or scanned into the computer and
categorised across many spectrums. And this can best be done using
a computer system with a good database.
	   S: Are you planning to build an archive of Malaysians ads for
future generations of Malaysians and students to refer to?
	   L: Yes. We hope libraries, advertising schools, advertising
associations and the like will be able to feature our advertisement
library in the near future when we are ready with a substantial
archive.
	   S: Who are your main clients and how do you serve them?
	   L: Our big clients are ad agencies, public relations companies
and those involved in the field of advertising.
	   Another 50 per cent comes from direct clients and the majority
of them are sizeable marketing companies.
	   We serve them in two ways. One, on a monthly retainer basis
where we either monitor the ads or news/programmes on an ongoing
basis.
	   And second, on an ad-hoc basis where they will contract us to
monitor the news/programme or do a compilation of a certain
category of ads.
	   As for the name MediaBanc, Media means we do all types of media
monitoring work and Banc suggests our customers can withdraw what
they need as and when they need to.
	   S: How many advertisements do you have in your library so far?
What categories do you cover?
	   L: We have all TV commercials from the past eights years (about
5,000) in our library and they cover all categories.
	   For radio and print ads, we started monitoring and compiling
them since we began operations; thus we have close to 1,000 radio
spots and about 6,000 print ads. They cover all the major product
and service categories.
	   S: Is your company a Malaysian operation? Are there similar
types of companies in the region?
	   L: We are currently operating in Malaysia only. Other Southeast
Asian countries do not have a similar company - as far as we know.
Thus, we would like to open a similar operation in each country in
this region.
	   We have planned to start off in the second country by the end of
this year and by the year 2000, we would like to have a presence in
all countries in the region.
	   S: Can you give us an idea of your rates?
	   L: Each request from clients is different from the next. Thus,
it is almost impossible for us to give you a rate structure.
	   But we assure you it is much cheaper compared with monitoring
ads yourself.
	   S: You used to work in the advertising business before. How did
this novel idea come to mind and what were your early challenges
and obstacles?
	   L: I must say that our operation is welcomed and appreciated by
everyone who understands our service.
	   Can you imagine doing a new campaign for your client without
first checking what the competitors are doing? I am sure you can
name numerous other situations where MediaBanc services could have
been of assistance.
	   We saw all these as opportunities and that's when we decided to
start the company.
	   In the early days, I even remember having to go around,
practically begging others to either loan me or let me have a copy
of commercials.
	   In fact, in the beginning, we faced obstacles in promoting our
service as it was a new concept and no one here had been exposed to
it before.
	   But now, things are moving along quite nicely. There's nothing
like providing a niche service.

	   ASSET securitisation should be made available in the Islamic
capital market as it can provide enormous flexibility to the
Islamic Debt Securities (IDS), said an analyst at the Rating Agency
Malaysia (RAM).
	   Zameema Ariff, the analyst at RAM's Islamic desk said this
concept could be the key answer to one of the many issues of the
Islamic Finance industry - recourse to liquidity.
	   ``A factor that could be considered so as to raise our Islamic
capital market to a new dimension is the concept of securitisation
- specifically asset-backed securitisation,'' said Zameema.
	   ``Some of the benefits of asset securitisation such as the
concept of tranching the cash flow from the financial assets are
just as applicable in Islamic asset securitisation,'' said added.
	   This concept, she said, can provide enormous flexibility as each
instrument can be formulated and designed to meet the investment
objectives of different classes of investors.
	   Zameema believed that by broadening and deepening the Islamic
capital market, it would not only provide greater options to the
existing pool of capital providers but would also draw the
attention of the international investment community especially
those from the West Asia.
	   In an article dated June 1 1998, she said although Islamic
financing is one of the fastest growing capital pools nowadays, the
Islamic capital market still lacks the attractiveness.
	   She noted that the Islamic capital market would need to be
attractive from all angles and in all aspects which include
pricing, innovations, universality of acceptance, practicality and
flexibility.
	   The selection of a financing option is primarily based on merit,
she said and not based on religious considerations or moral
suasion.
	   She said the broadening of the investor base would also bring
Malaysia one step closer to realising its vision to become the
regional financial centre.
	   In 1997, some RM10 billion was raised from Islamic Debt
Securities (IDS) which constitutes 21 per cent of the country's
total private debt securities.
	   This figures show that the Malaysian IDS market has successfully
grown out of its infancy phase, said Zameema.
	   ``The viability of Islamic finance is no longer an issue as the
success of the domestic IDS market within a short period is a
testimony of the widespread acceptance of Islamic finance
principles in the country,'' she said.
	   According to Zameema, the roots of IDS in Malaysia existed 25
years ago with the birth of the Pilgrimage Fund 1973 - the first
Islamic financial institution in Malaysia.

	   PETALING JAYA, Mon. - The magistrate's court today set a fresh
date for mention of a case where a businessman is charged with
voluntarily causing hurt to one of his four wives.
	   Magistrate Rafidah Omar set July 2 to enable Abd Rahman Binchok,
50, of Batu 13, Puchong, to engage a counsel to represent him.
	   He is alleged to have voluntarily caused hurt to Siti Rohaya
Alang Ibrahim, 40, with a chair at a house in Puchong Perdana about
11am on Aug 19 last year.

yesterday as the underlying cash market ended the day sharply down.
	   Spot month June ended 22 points lower to close at 509.0 with

	   WHILE fare payment on urban transit in Malaysia continues to
operate in isolation from each other, many countries have moved
towards the ``one ticket from origin to destination'' concept of
travel.
	   One has to understand that integrated ticketing is not a system
but a concept. There are various ways to implement it.
	   It can mean literally just one ticket from origin to
destination.
	   Some systems also require passengers to buy ``transfer tickets''
while others work on the common stored-value card or electronic
smartcard which can be used on various modes of transport.
	   One of the simplest examples is Melbourne, where public
transport is served by three modes, namely bus, commuter trains and
trams.
	   Although the trains and trams are operated by The Met (the
trading name of the Public Transportation Corporation) many bus
services, especially in the outer suburban areas, are run by
private operators.
	   Nevertheless, tickets commonly known as ``Met tickets'' can be
used on all services within the authority's three zones.
	   The beauty of the system is that a commuter can use all three
modes of transport with just one ticket, which can come in the form
of a two-hour, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly ticket, bought
according to the zones in which one needs to travel.
	   Besides single-zone tickets, multiple-zone tickets are also
available.
	   If a commuter has a two-hour Zone One and Two ticket, he can
travel on a feeder bus from his home in Zone Two, transfer to a
commuter train which brings him into the city in Zone One, and then
transfer onto a tram when he gets off the train.
	   His ticket will be valid for two hours from his first journey
and can be used for as many trips on any mode within the two zones
as long as they are completed within the two hours.
	   Working on a different concept is the system in Singapore, where
the common ticket is actually a stored value card, called the
Farecard, issued by a common clearing house Transitlink Pte Ltd.
	   The card can be used on the two bus companies which cover the
entire republic (Singapore Bus Service and Trans-Island Bus
Service), and the rail-based Mass Rapid Transit.
	   For buses, commuters will have to feed the Farecard into a
validator which is installed on all buses.
	   The commuter presses a button to indicate the fare, which will
be deducted from the card. A ticket is then issued to prove
payment.
	   To ride on the MRT, a commuter merely has to feed the card into
the turnstile machine upon entering or leaving the system. The
correct fare will be deducted automatically.
	   Strictly speaking, the card itself is not a ticket, and the
passenger still pays separate fares for each mode of travel.
However, the fact that the card is accepted by all modes and allows
for cashless travel makes it as convenient as a common ticket.
	   One further peculiarity the card has afforded is the transfer
rebate system, making travel involving transfers from one mode to
another cheaper than the total amount of full fares for each trip
added up.
	   According to the guidebook issued by Transitlink, the subsequent
fare will be 25 cents less for adults and 10 cents less for
children if a commuter transfers from the MRT to a bus within 30
minutes of leaving the MRT exit turnstile.
	   Similarly, the same rebate will be given to a commuter who
transfers from a bus to MRT, or from one bus to another.
	   In these cases, the time given for the transfer depends on the
fare paid on the bus used before the transfer is made.
	   The Transitlink card does not replace the individual fare
collecting systems of the bus companies or MRT, where commuters can
still pay cash to buy tickets.
	   A letter from SBS Bus Services Pte Lte corporate communications
manager Loo Ing Heng said his company was also participating in a
trial conducted by the Singapore Land Transport Authority for the
use of contactless smartcards, similar to Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd's
Touch n' Go card.
	   One place where the smartcard has been successful is Hong Kong,
where the Octopus Card allows a commuter to travel on the
underground Mass Transit Railway, Tuen Mun-Yuen Long light rail
transit, Kowloon-Canton (commuter) railway, Citybus, Kowloon Motor
Bus and by ferry to the outer islands.
	   All these systems, including the MTR, have the smartcard readers
at the entrance and exits, where passengers have to ``touch'' their
cards upon entry and exit, and the relevant fares will be deducted
automatically.
	   And just like Singapore, the Octopus Card system merely
supplements the individual ticketing systems of each mode.
Passengers can still purchase tickets for each form of transport.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten, who won the French Open singles
title last year, was disqualified in doubles Tuesday when he threw
his racket at an umpire _ hitting a fan in the stands.
	   Kuerten, who made a storybook run to the men's title last year
but was knocked out in singles last week in the second round by
Marat Safin, faces a fine because of the outburst.
	   It was not immediately known whether the fan hit by the racket
was hurt.
	   Kuerten was teamed with fellow Brazilian Fernando Meligeni in a
doubles match against Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman and Australia's
Patrick Rafter in a doubles match on the Suzanne Lenglen Court when
the incident occurred.
	   ``At the end of the first set tiebreaker, he threw his racket
that went just past the chair umpire and went into the stands,
hitting someone in the stands,'' said Stefan Fransson, a Grand Slam
supervisor. ``He threw it from around the service line.''

	   SHAH ALAM, Mon. - Police have so far identified two companies
involved in the theft of water in Selangor and both the cases have
been referred to the Deputy Public Prosecutor for action, said
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor today.
	   Without naming the companies, he said the police were awaiting
the DPP's instructions.
	   ``We believe there are many more industries involved in the
theft of water. We will be working closely with the State
Government, Waterworks Department and other relevant authorities to
nab the culprits.''
	   Ever since the water rationing exercise, Rahim said the police
in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur had had their hands full responding to
complaints related to water woes including theft, vandalism of
water pipes and hydrants and fights between residents when water
tankers visited the housing estates.
	   ``Problems related to water supply are also highlighted in the
media practically every day,'' he added.
	   Speaking to reporters after paying a courtesy call on Selangor
Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar at his office today, Rahim felt
that public should voice their grouses and problems to the State
Government, State Exco and the relevant departments.
	   ``We understand the problems the people face in the dry spell.
	   ``People should understand and be patient. They should not fight
or vandalise pipes and hydrants.''
	   From his discussion with the Menteri Besar, Rahim said he came
to understand that all possible short and long-term measures were
being taken to resolve the water problem.
	   He said he also discussed with Abu Hassan matters pertaining to
crime and social problems in the State.
	   ``We are very concerned about the increase in crime, especially
that related to property in Selangor and Federal Territory, over
the past four months.
	   ``Property crime has shot up by 40 per cent the last few months
as compared with the same corresponding period last year.''
	   He said Kuala Lumpur and Selangor topped the list in terms of
the crime index and police were taking a serious view of the matter
as most of the crimes were committed in the Klang Valley.
	   ``These are all preventable crimes. With the co-operation of the
public, property crime can be reduced,'' he said, adding that the
State Government had also sought the co-operation of the police in
reducing social problems involving youths.
	   Abu Hassan confirmed that Rahim discussed the theft of water,
among other topics, and that the State Government had deployed
enforcement officers to nab culprits and errant companies.
	   ``Vandalising pipes to get water is becoming a serious problem
in Selangor and we need the co-operation of the police. If people
start vandalising, then the problem of water will worsen,'' he
added.
	   As to the burning of two suraus, Abu Hassan said investigations
had been stepped up by the police and the Islamic Religious
Department.
	   A group of men were alleged to have set fire to the suraus
between 3am and 5am on Saturday.

Thyssen, Krupp receive EU approval for merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Thyssen and Krupp said Tuesday the
European Union had conditionally approved their merger plans,
clearing aside the major remaining hurdle to the creation of one of
Europe's largest industrial firms.
	   The new company, Thyssen Krupp AG, is to have a total of 180,000
employees when the merger takes effect next March. The companies
have predicted combined sales of 70 billion marks (dlrs 40 billion)
this fiscal year.
	   As Europe's fifth-biggest industrial concern, the new company
will rank behind carmakers Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen, and
electronics and communications giants Siemens and Veba.
	   Thyssen said the EU commission had set a few minor conditions on
the merger to address concerns about unfair dominance of Europe's
escalator and elevator markets.
	   Last year, the two companies merged their steel operations to
create Europe's largest steelmaker, in a move that led to talks on
a full merger.
	   Thyssen AG, based in Duesseldorf, has operations in capital
goods, manufactured products, trading and services, in addition to
steel.
	   Based in Essen, Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp resulted from the merger
of German steel and engineering groups Krupp AG and Hoesch AG in
December 1992.

	   AFTER more than a year of silence, the almost-dead story of
common ticketing for public transport in the Klang Valley was given
a fresh breath of life with a plea early this month for its
implementation during the Commonwealth Games.
	   Although the call was for a watered-down version of the original
and covers only two bus companies (Intrakota and Cityliner) and
Sistem Transit Aliran Ringan Sdn Bhd's light rail service, the plea
by Kuala Lumpur Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Shariff
nevertheless shows how far we are from adopting such a concept.
	   Kamaruzzaman admitted it was impossible for the original plan,
involving seven operators, to be implemented in time for the Games,
even though the call came more than a year ago.
	   This setback seems to fit in perfectly with all the others that
have dogged the public transport sector.
	   Although the seven commuter rail, light rail and bus operators
in the Klang Valley signed a memorandum of understanding in
February last year to come up with a common ticket, nothing has
emerged even until now.
	   The seven are KTM Bhd, Park May Bhd, Intrakota Consolidated Sdn
Bhd, Sistem Transit Aliran Ringan Sdn Bhd, Projek Usahasama Transit
Ringan Automatik Sdn Bhd, Express Rail Link Sdn Bhd and Kuala
Lumpur People Rapid Transit Sdn Bhd.
	   But last October Kamaruzzaman said it was up to the individual
operators to decide whether they wanted the system, and that a new
one would be chosen if the cost of implementing it was too high.
	   He however backed down from that statement and said the move
towards integrated ticketing would be completed by this year.
	   According to Universiti Malaya expert on transport economics,
Associate Professor G. Naidu, the foot dragging has more to do with
attitude rather than technological barriers.
	   ``The operators basically do not see the benefit of sharing the
profits which come with sharing a common system,'' he says.
	   The situation, he says, was a perfect illustration of a mismatch
between the interests of the private and that of the public sector.
	   Besides the reluctance to allow a common clearing house to
handle their fares and paying it for that service, operators are
also not happy investing in another ticketing system on top of what
they have already put in for their present system.
	   ``When the Government sealed the concession agreements with
these operators, ticketing was left to the operators to implement
according to their own specifications.
	   ``The Government did not tell them they had to talk to each
other about ticketing,'' says Sabariah Jemali, coordinator of the
Malaysian Centre for Transportation Studies of Institut Teknologi
Mara.
	   In other words, the current situation owes much to lack of
foresight at the very beginning of the ``modernisation'' of Klang
Valley's public transport system.
	   The economic slowdown will certainly not help the situation.
Indeed, it will only create more resistance to the large
investments required to modify their individual systems.
	   However, other than economic reasons, there is very little else
which can be used to justify the operators' reluctance to have a
common ticket.
	   Fare evasion can easily be sorted out by advanced technology and
increased inspection. At the same time, the popular argument that
the complex formula for revenue distribution together with a
clearing house is not feasible will not hold water.
	   ``Integrated ticketing is such a common thing in the world now.
It is obvious that the supposed complications can be easily sorted
out,'' says UM's Naidu.
	   The fact may have been missed by many but integrated ticketing
is actually already here in Malaysia, although the use of the
common card is not restricted to public transport but can also be
utilised for toll payments.
	   The Touch n' Go smartcards, distributed by Rangkaian Segar Sdn
Bhd, can be used not only for fare payment on Park May Bhd buses
but also for paying toll on the Federal Highway, Jalan Pahang,
Jalan Cheras and the East-West Link in Kuala Lumpur, the Penang
Bridge and the Malaysia- Singapore Second Crossing and Second Link
Expressway in Johor.
	   As for its use on public transport, Hisham Othman, Rangkaian
Segar's chief operating officer, says it will also be used on the
second LRT service run by Projek Usahasama Transit Ringan Automatik
Sdn Bhd when it becomes operational.
	   It is believed that KTM Komuter will also use the prepaid card
in the near future.
	   Although essentially catering for companies within the Renong
Group, its increasing involvement in the transport industry could
mean that the Touch n' Go card will be the common ticket for public
transportation in the Klang Valley.
	   While the Renong connection has made it easy for the Touch n' Go
to be implemented with the present companies, Hisham explained that
Rangkaian Segar still played the role of a clearing house and stuck
to revenue remitting procedures to these companies strictly as if
the companies were not at all connected.
	   ``We have no problem knowing exactly how much each company earns
as it is recorded each time a person uses the card. Revenue is
cleared to each company within 24 hours,'' he says.
	   Rangkaian Segar collects a commission from these companies for
its services as a clearing house.
	   On the possibility of people evading fares, especially on buses,
Hisham says the technological abilities of the smartcard had
managed to overcome the problem. ``On the bus, if a passenger fails
to `touch' the reader when he leaves the bus, the maximum fare for
the journey will be deducted from his card automatically,'' Hisham
says.
	   The problem does not arise in closed ticketing systems or toll
gates as turnstiles or the boom gate will not allow people who have
not paid to go through.
	   Hisham also says the Touch n' Go system does not replace a
company's existing ticketing system, but is merely an addition to
it.
	   ``At the toll gates, the normal cash payment can still be done,
but card users will get dedicated lines,'' he says.
	   Besides eliminating the need for cash, Hisham says the greatest
plus point the Touch n' Go card possesses is the ease and speed in
which it can be used.
	   ``If the card needs to be swiped, you might as well pay cash,''
he says.
	   Speed is of course central to the argument for a common ticket,
which in turn is fundamental in the issue of integrating the
separate transport operations.
	   System integration itself has been high on the public transport
agenda worldwide as the reality in most cities is that the commuter
has to use more than one mode of transport to get to his or her
destination.
	   Moves to reduce duplication of routes and the adoption of
rail-based mass transit which require feeder services will only
increase the incidence of passengers needing to hop from one form
of transport to another.
	   ``To make public transport successful means making it as
convenient as possible for passengers. That includes making it easy
to switch from mode to mode,'' says A. Rahman Paul Barter,
coordinator of Sustainable Transport Action Network for Asia and
the Pacific, or Sustran.
	   Besides convenience, a simple fact is that the common ticket can
cut down transfer time and therefore reduce door-to-door travel
time.
	   And that is crucial in making public transport attractive.
	   ``Universally, the talk is about a `seamless flow' where
passengers move from one mode to another in such a way that it
almost feels as if it is just one continuous trip,'' says UM's
Naidu.
	   This seamless flow could even bring in economic benefits as the
overall number of commuters could actually go up with the increased
convenience, a phenomenon Sustran's Barter calls the ``network
effect.''
	   Nevertheless, Naidu does not envision integrated ticketing
taking off without the long overdue push by the authorities. ``It
basically boils down to the lack of political will to implement
integrated ticketing.''
	   Meanwhile, commuters will just have to endure the hassles of
juggling with pocketfuls of coins and endless queues for tickets
when setting out on a journey across town.

	   The Council of Wetlands International-Asia Pacific held its
Fifth Meeting from April 16 to 18 in Kuala Lumpur at its office in
the Institute of Postgraduate Studies and Research (IPSR) of the
University of Malaya.
	   Appointed as interim executive director is Mr Joost van der Ven
who has broad international expertise and has been requested to
implement organisational and business changes as decided by the
Council.
	   The meeting was attended by Council members Allison
Russell-French, Li Lu Kang (as proxy for Zhen Ren De), Maki Koyama,
Dato V. Sivaparanjothi, Dato V. Danabalan, Ishak Mohamad and
Professor Mohamed Ali Hashim. The meeting was chaired by Dato Siva,
who is also vice-chairman of the Council.
	   Also present were observers Chris Kalden, president of Wetlands
International and Brendan Edgar.
	   The Council reviewed the programmatic and institutional
developments of Wetlands International-Asia Pacific and had a look
at the recent difficulties. The Council also made a number of
important decisions and adopted several far reaching measures to
put in place a stable and secure governing body and management
structure, namely: To ensure more direct involvement of the
Council. One of the decisions was to set up a Council management
committee, consisting of two Malaysian Council members and the
executive director. The committee will be chaired by Dato
Danabalan.
	   A decision to appoint an interim executive director and to start
the search for a permanent executive director through an open
selection process.
	   An agreement to develop a triennial plan that will take Wetlands
International well into the next millenium. The triennial plan will
be presented during the Second International Conference on Wetlands
and Development to be held in Dakar, Senegal, from November 8-14.
	   Adopting a number of resolutions to strengthen management and
financial procedures.
	   ``We are ready and able to fulfill our role as the leading NGO
in the field of wetland conservation and management in the region.
This is an essential role during times in which we are confronted
on a daily basis with the need for proper water resources
management and sound biodiversity policies,'' Dato Siva said.
	   Kalden, who attended the meeting on behalf of the executive
committee and to observe the proceedings and raise matters of
concern, said that he is confident that good governance has been
re-established.
	   He indicated that wetland conservation and management is a
global issue that is firmly on the international political agenda.
But regional and local action is essential because ``that is where
the wetlands and the people are''.

	   BINARIANG Bhd, the telecommunications company which operates the
Maxis Mobile network, will spend a capital expenditure of more than
RM1 billion in the next three years.
	   The funds for the capital expenditure will come from existing
shareholders, new shareholders, borrowings and strategic investors,
chief operating officer Jamaludin Ibrahim said in an interview in
conjunction with World's Telecommunications Day recently.
	   It is understood that Binariang is holding discussions with
several parties, including Singapore Telecom Ltd and Cable and
Wireless of the UK, following moves by the Government to allow a 61
per cent foreign ownership in telecommunication companies.
	   Negotiations are still on-going with several parties and are in
the final stages. The deal is expected to be concluded in a few
weeks.
	   When asked on the details of the negotiations Jamaludin,
however, declined to comment.
	   Binariang had invested RM1 billion over the past three years on
fixed line network, mobile services, international gateway and
satellites.
	   This year alone, over RM300 million is expected to be spent in
improving its network.
	   Due to capital constraints, Jamaludin said investments will
mainly be directed to mobile services and gateway expansion while
investments for fixed line network will be eased temporarily.
	   The company expects mobile subscribers to increase to 500,000 by
the end of this year from its existing 400,000.
	   Jamaludin declined to give the breakdown in investment for the
respective sectors, but he said about 80 per cent of the investment
for the mobile sector will be utilised to improve its existing
network services with new cells sites and micro cells.
	   ``We will be enhancing additional capacity to strengthen the
network and network for the existing 400,000 customers rather than
going for new area coverage,'' he said.
	   Jamaludin said while Maxis Mobile is not much affected by the
economic slowdown, its investment plans will be delayed for about a
month or two due to a revision for its future plans.
	   The slowdown, however, has affected the company's fixed line
network expansion as its additional targets of 100,000 homes has
been reduced to only 5,000 homes.
	   ``The fixed network is badly affected by the slowdown and the
capital constraint. We had initially targetted for an additional
100,000 homes for this year but there has been a drastic reduction
to 5,000,'' he said.
	   Currently, Maxis fixed line serves 52,000 homes.
	   ``I do not want people to perceive that we are reducing our
fixed line due to the slowdown ... we are serving more homes than
other operators, apart from Telekom,'' he said, adding that he
expects the fixed line network to consolidate in another year.
	   Binariang, he said, is also in discussions with developers and
other telecommunications companies to provide lines to areas where
they have supply agreements but are unable to fulfill their
obligations.
	   ``We are one of them. We are working with developers ... there
may be a delay in providing such services but we will not leave
customers in a lurch,'' he said when asked if Binariang is one of
the companies which has failed to carry out some of its fixed line
projects.

Former police commissioner admits he helped cover up death of activist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The country's top police commander
during apartheid said Tuesday that he helped cover up the death of
an anti-apartheid activist to avoid mass demonstrations and keep up
police morale.
	   Testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Johan
van der Merwe said he knew the body of Stanza Bopape was thrown
into a crocodile-infested river to hide the evidence. Bopape died
while being tortured by police in 1988.
	   ``The security branch was the most important shield ... between
order and anarchy in the country,'' van der Merwe said.
	   Van der Merwe, who was chief of the Security Branch at the time
of the coverup and later became the national police commissioner,
is seeking amnesty from the panel that is investigating politically
motivated abuses of human rights during the system of white rule.
	   His lawyer has disputed that he ordered Bopape's killing.
	   But Van der Merwe said Tuesday that he lied to his superiors,
including former Law and Order minister Adriaan Vlok, about
Bopape's death, keeping up the charade for years that the activist
had escaped from police custody.
	   The reconciliation process has enabled many families to discover
the truth about what happened to loved ones who disappeared without
a trace. Victims often were buried in unmarked graves.
	   Van der Merwe said he feared that anti-apartheid activists would
hear of Bopape's death in police custody after he was tortured by
electrical shock, and whip up emotions and riots.
	   Five of the amnesty applicants in the case have admitted to
torturing Bopape.

	   Q: I HAVE been married for a year. I had a miscarriage in
February last year. Since then, I have been having irregular cycles
and no conception.
	   During my last cycle the flow was very scanty, lasting only
three days. I am also overweight. My doctor says I have low
progesterone levels on day 21 of my cycle. Please advise.
	   A: WHEN progesterone is low one week after ovulation should have
been expected to take place, it usually indicates that there has
been no egg released. Failure to ovulate can be due to many
reasons, but being overweight can certainly contribute.
	   If you eat whole natural foods and cut out sugars and saturated
fats, the weight should start to come off regardless of how much
you eat.
	   If you chart your body-at-rest temperature you will also be able
to see two other important things. Firstly, if you are ovulating,
the temperature will rise at mid-cycle, as progesterone increases
body heat.
	   Secondly, if the temperatures are consistently off the bottom of
the graph, you may have a hypo-thyroid problem, which could also
effect reproductive health and weight gain. Charting is easily
learnt by ordering one of my Natural Fertility Management kits.

	   MANY people who think of wetlands as swampy areas are surprised
to find that even coral reef flats are classified wetland habitats.
	   It is indeed an eye opener for them to realise that wetlands
also consist of habitats of such colour and beauty.
	   Coral reef flats are considered the most aesthetically beautiful
underwater community known. Today, this habitat is being depleted
at an alarming rate. According to researchers, damage to coral
reefs in Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Seychelles,
Thailand, Indonesia, United Republic of Tanzania and other
countries has been irreparable.
	   Studies also show that more than half of the reefs in South East
Asia are in advanced stages of destruction, with about 25 per cent
of live coral cover in good condition and a mere five per cent in
excellent condition.
	   Coral reefs occupy only about 0.1 per cent of the surface of the
planet and yet it is estimated that they produce almost 10 per cent
of the world fish landings.
	   In Malaysia, almost 50 per cent of our seafood come from the
reefs.
	   The primary productivity of coral reefs equals or surpasses all
other natural eco-systems, even rain forests and one reef may
support as many as 3,000 species.
	   Coral reefs are a valuable source for the tourism industry. The
multi-coloured corals, fish, shells, tubeworms and other organisms
as well as shallow calm lagoons and clean beaches associated with
many coral reefs attract numerous visitors.
	   This wetland habitat is also regarded as importantbreeding and
nursery grounds for many marine organisms including fishes,
lobsters, cephalopods and a variety of molluscs.
	   In many places, coral reefs take the full impact of the waves
and dissipate its energy, thereby preventing erosion.
	   They also block ocean currents which could otherwise erode
coastal areas.
	   The science of marine pharmacology is in its infancy and coral
reef organisms might further provide valuable sources for
medicinally useful compounds which are yet to be discovered.
	   Reefs are sensitive and easily destroyed because they require
specific conditions to form and survive.
	   Conditions favouring the development of reefs include water
temperatures above 18o Celsius, water depth shallower than 50
metres, constant salinity greater than 30 but less than 30 parts
per thousand, low sedimentation rates, sufficient circulation of
pollution-free water and pre-existing hard substrate.
	   As the population of the world increases, so does the threat to
coral reefs. The most important single cause of reef degradation is
sedimentation resulting from human activities on land.
	   These include unsound agricultural and forestry practices,
mismanagement of watersheds, exploitation of mangroves,
earth-moving for construction and the dumping of terrestrial and
marine mine tailings and effluents.
	   Increased turbidity reduces the penetration of sunlight, thus
inhibiting photosynthesis in primary producers such as the
symbiotic algae of coral polyps. This in turn decreases the coral
growth.
	   Coral communities in deeper waters are at the margins of light
penetration and may be the most vulnerable. Sedimentation also
smothers living coral, and silt hinders the settling of coral
larvae.
	   Destructive fishing methods common in the Philippines,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand such as blasting, dragging nets
over reefs, use of cyanide and traditional spearing are also
threats to this beautiful eco-system.
	   Apart from threats by man, coral reefs also have a natural
enemy. The crown-of-thorns starfish is one of the natural predators
that destroy coral reefs. This starfish eats stony corals and
devastates large areas of reef during an outbreak.
	   In Malaysia, the Pulau Redang Marine Park corals are in danger
of being completely destroyed by these voracious predators.
	   However, steps are being taken to reduce the rate of coral reef
depletion throughout the world.
	   Last year was officially designated the International Year of
the Reef by the United Nations to conserve and sustainably manage
this wetland habitat.
	   Corporate sectors, government agencies and NGOs have been
involved in the conservation of coral reefs.
	   In Malaysia, HongkongBank became involved with the Government's
conservation effort through the Department of Fisheries, by
sponsoring and participating in expeditions to remove
crown-of-thorns starfish from the Pulau Redang Marine Park.
	   The Government is also helping conservation work by establishing
marine parks. Marine parks are areas of the sea zoned as
sanctuaries for the coral reef community.
	   Numerous NGOs and institutions of higher learning are conducting
extensive research and creating awareness to conserve coral reefs
throughout the globe.
	   It is sad that one of the most productive and beautiful
eco-systems in the world is being destroyed through human
ignorance. We should be considerate and conserve these eco-systems
so that our future generations may see and enjoy them as we have.

	   THE Kuala Lumpur Tin Market closed easier by 46 sen to RM21.94
per kg yesterday due to heavy selling on lack of supportive
indicators.
	   Sentiments in the market were dampened further by the lacklustre
performance of the London Metal Exchange (LME) last Friday.
	   At the KLTM's opening, bids totalled 53 tonnes against offers of
109 tonnes..
	   Turnover at the close amounted to 109 tonnes compared to 91
tonnes last Friday.
	   Buyers were from Europe, Japan and locally.
	   The price differential of the KLTM to the LME stood at a premium
of US$6 per tonnes against US$87 per tonne previously.

	   There had been disputes about line calls during the tiebreaker,
which the Brazilians lost. Bruno Rebeuh, the chair umpire for the
match, was not available to discuss the incident.
	   Fransson said Kuerten, who was immediately disqualified, ``will

	   Benjamin Deshayes, an usher at the match, said the incident
happened moments after the end of the tiebreaker.

Swiss hope report will lead to `more objective discussion' With US-Nazi Gold 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland on Tuesday welcomed a U.S.
government report concluding that neutral nations supplied Nazi
Germany with hundreds of millions of dollars of trade, and stressed
that its own efforts to reappraise its past continue.
	   ``In regard to Switzerland, the American report contains no
essentially new findings,'' the ruling Federal Council said in a
statement.
	   A U.S. report last year accused Switzerland of providing
financing to Nazi Germany that prolonged World War II.
	   The coalition cabinet said it hopes the report ``will contribute
to more objective discussion, particularly in the United States, on
Switzerland's role during World War II.''
	   ``It says in effect that it is wrong to oversimplify and
apportion historic blame on the basis of isolated facts,'' the
statement added.
	   Swiss commercial banks, Jewish organizations and lawyers for
class-action claimants are negotiating a global settlement of
claims by Holocaust victims.
	   Class-action suits for dlrs 23 billion have been filed in the
United States against Swiss banks and insurance companies on behalf
of Holocaust victims and their heirs.
	   Jewish organizations have accused the banks of delays in
allowing Holocaust victims' heirs access to dormant assets.
	   The Swiss cabinet said the publication last week by an
independent panel of historians of a study on Switzerland's gold
dealings with Germany ``proves that Switzerland takes the
reappraisal of its history seriously.''
	   The government ``welcomes the fact that the U.S. government is
also taking this course,'' the statement added.
	   The U.S. ambassador in Bern, Madeleine May Kunin, paid tribute
in a statement to Switzerland's efforts to address its past.
	   ``Switzerland stands at the forefront of this international
effort to address one of the darkest chapters in history,'' she
said.

	   IT'S amazing how far a simple idea can stretch. For inventor
Robest Yong, every simple idea that pops into his head has
stretched all the way to the bank. No wonder he's a picture of
cheerfulness as he perches on one edge of the sofa while I sink
into my corner.
	   His lightweight frame remains perched as we talk, and the image
of a bird ready to take flight comes to mind. He exudes energy and
a quiet determination to grasp at ideas that will bring financial
rewards.
	   The year 1994 will surely be etched in his memory as the year he
really came into his own.
	   Pitted against candidates of intellectual standing, he was
ecstatic to be selected as the National Inventor of the Year by the
Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment. He stood tall
as he received the RM20,000 award.
	   ``I felt good, no doubt about it. The other shortlisted
candidates had doctorates to their names. I was the small fry and
stood out like a sore thumb,'' he recalls, smiling at the eventual
turn of events.
	   Today, Yong's favourite response when asked about his amazing
inventiveness is that one does not need a Ph.D to become an
inventor.
	   ``What is far more important is an open mind and keen
observation. No doubt a high IQ gives you an edge but your
intelligence will not bring results if you have a one-track mind,''
the 38-year-old offers.
	   Ever since the national recognition as an inventor of high
calibre, Yong has gone on to win international acclaim.
	   Participating yearly at the International Exhibition of
Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland, Yong has bagged awards that now
grace the wall in his home.
	   In 1994, he won the Gold award for his Polyclone Instant Rubber
Stamp Machine which now forms the core of his business
transactions; in 1995 he won the Silver medal for his Kamikaze
Mosquito Glue; in 1996 he was awarded the Bronze medal for his
Carver Up Car Mat Cover, and in 1997 he bagged the Bronze award for
his Automatic Brake Lock.
	   Last year also saw a double win for him as he walked away with
the RM5,000 prize in the category for Creative Innovations in
conjunction with the National Youth Day celebrations in Malaysia.
	   So how does it feel to be a winner all the way?
	   The Penangite grins. Suddenly the years are taken off his face
and I'm left sitting with the charming youth that he really is.
	   ``Great, though I must say my ambition is not to be the greatest
inventor in Malaysia but the richest!''
	   He seems set on the path, if the Ford TX3 Lynx in his driveway
is anything to go by. The inside of his house may not be as
glamorous as his car, but it bespeaks him all right.
	   Boxes of plastic handles for rubber stamps are stacked against
one wall from end to end, and a computer sits on a table laden with
shelves of paraphernalia of invention at the opposite end.
	   The sitting room wall is lined with framed awards and plaques of
recognition sit on side tables, together with a disarray of stuff.
	   He walks towards the computer and beckons me to follow.
Switching it on, he asks for my photo and prepares to design a
rubber stamp for me with my face on it. Gosh, what a sure-fire way
to make my presence felt! Just stamp my face all over! But alas, my
photo doesn't turn out well because it's in colour. A
black-and-white would be perfect. So he creates an address stamp
for me instead.
	   Satisfied with his input, he gets a computer printout and
proceeds to place a blue-coloured negative on top of it, after
which he laminates it on a machine so that the image is printed
onto the negative.
	   He then places on top of the negative what looks like a thick
piece of plastic to me but what he calls a polyclone stamp plate.
The card goes into the rubber stamp machine that he invented. We
wait a minute-and-a-half and the card is ready to be washed in a
basin of tap water.
	   Yong dries it with a hair dryer and placing the card back into
his machine, switches on the dryer light and waits for another few
minutes.
	   This process, he explains, is to harden the card. He then uses
double-sided tape to stick the card onto the stamp holder, clamps
the handle into place, and hey presto, the job's done in 10
minutes.
	   ``That'll be RM8 please,'' he jokes, referring to the standard
rate for a rubber stamp these days. But, he's quick to point out,
that price is based on collection of card after 24 hours. For
urgent needs, like in 10 minutes flat, rubber stamp-makers charge
up to RM25.
	   It's easy to understand why his invention is garnering good
sales. Given a good location and a regular clientele, Yong claims
the initial cost of RM3,800 to buy his machine can be recouped
within months.
	   Of course, other costs like a computer system, a laminating
machine and stamp handles which cost 50 sen each, have to be taken
into consideration.
	   There are advantages in using Yong's invention. Hassles like
time-consuming letter composition, messy plaster moulds and
chemicals are done away with. There is also the advantage of a
one-man operation in a small working space.
	   And, according to him, rubber stamps of any shape, size,
language, font- type or design can be done in 10 minutes.
	   Electricity costs, he maintains, are minimal because the four
exposure lamps in the machine equal a 40-watt fluorescent lamp.
	   SINCE he invented the Polyclone Instant Rubber Stamp Machine,
Yong has continued to ride its waves of success, going from
strength to strength.
	   He set up a factory in Sungai Way, Kuala Lumpur, to manufacture
the machine which he sells not only in Malaysia but also in
countries like America, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, the Fiji
Islands, Australia, Japan and Thailand.
	   ``We have agents all over the world,'' he says. The `we' refers
to his wife Teng Yu-Mein who helps him in the business, acting as
secretary-of-sorts.
	   Apart from Thailand, where sales have decreased by almost 50 per
cent because of the current economic slowdown, worldwide sales for
his machine have not been affected. In Malaysia, orders continue to
come in, even from small towns like Kuala Lipis.
	   It had taken a bit of dogged persistence, especially during the
early days of uncertainty, before Yong's folks gave him the thumbs
up.
	   After all, many people are likely to be sceptical about the
likelihood of carving a living out of an invention.
	   ``But my family started to believe in the possibilities after my
inventions proved successful,'' Yong says.
	   His parents live in Nibong Tebal and his siblings, numbering
eight boys and two girls are scattered all over the country.
	   ``Life was very competitive as a child,'' he recalls. The sixth
child in the family, he had to share things and use hand-me-downs.
	   Consequently, he developed the habit of making his own toys. He
also fiddled with things, like bicycles, taking them apart because
he was curious about their components.
	   Obviously his spirit of invention was set in motion during
childhood.
	   After his secondary schooling in Nibong Tebal, Yong went to
Japan to take up a course in machineries. In the two years he was
there, he learned the technology of printing and later, back in
Malaysia, applied his knowledge in a company dealing with printing
machines.
	   Ten years later, he decided to freelance as a technician for
printing machines. In 1993, while freelancing, he hit upon the idea
of the rubber stamp machine.
	   In 1994 he was ready to submit his invention for Mindex, the
Malaysian Invention and Design Exhibition organised by Minds, the
Malaysian Invention and Design Society.
	   He walked away with the first prize. Minds then submitted his
design for the international competition in Switzerland. The rest,
as they say, is history.
	   Despite the success of his rubber stamp machine, Yong is not one
to rest on his laurels. He has kept himself busy inventing other
things which have not gone unrecognised.
	   A mosquito attraction is one of his inventions. Calling it the
Kamikaze Mosquito Glue, he has designed it such that the scent
attracts mosquitoes and the glue kills them.
	   Then there is his car mat cover which has pocket vents that
allow the dirt to gather on the mat but is not seen on top.
	   Like sweeping the dust under the carpet? I tease, and he nods
smilingly.
	   Another invention is the automatic brake lock which he says
works when the brake is stepped on fully, and the car is
stationery.
	   The brake is then automatically locked. It can be unlocked by
stepping on the accelerator. Yong is also working on a synchronised
locking system for toilets which are linked to two rooms.
	   His latest invention features a basin and a tap built onto the
cover of the water tank. Clean water for hand washing automatically
flows from the tap as soon as the toilet is flushed. The ``used''
water then flows back into the water tank to be used for the next
flush.
	   ``I got the idea after I saw the frequent breakage of the top
covers in petrol stations toilets. People would lift off the covers
to wash their hands in the water, and usually break them. So I
thought about how to solve this problem and at the same time
recycle the water,'' he says.
	   The result is Flush `n' Wash Water Closet, which, if present
negotiations with a company go well, will soon be available in the
market.
	   All the consumer has to do is replace the top cover of his
toilet bowl with the cover that Yong has invented.
	   No installation required, and the cost of replacing the cover
would be minimal, according to him. It seems that all his ideas
turn out to be lucrative for him. I guess mere inventiveness is not
enough. One must have a business head as well. Yong agrees.
	   ``Ideas must be creative and at the same time be practical. I
can't sell my inventions if they don't make good products.
	   ``Some inventors are sentimental and have romantic ideas which
are not practical, so they lose money.
	   ``Of course we can't compete with big corporate bodies which
have money for RD, like in the case of electronics. But we can
focus on simple ideas and turn them into useful products,'' he
advises.
	   He gets his ideas by thinking all the time, he says. Sometimes
they come by chance, sometimes through exposure to problems.
	   Whatever the case, once an idea forms in his head, Yong delves
into the intricacies of developing the technology.
	   In areas where he can't manufacture the products, he sells the
concept and patent right.
	   Yong has come a long way since he worked as a technician.
	   Self-employment now gives him the flexibility and freedom to
develop his concepts, and with a mind ever brimming with ideas, he
is fully occupied translating them into workable solutions for all
the problems his keen eye perceives.

	   THE Malaysian rubber prices closed easier today on lacklustre
trade.
	   Against last Friday, July RSS-One dropped two sen to 209 sen per
kg, while SMR-20 erased one sen to 285.5 sen.
	   Trading remained quiet as players refrained from the market on
the lack of fresh leads, said a dealer from a local trading house.
	   Asked on the prospects of the market, he said that it was
difficult to predict as the rubber prices did not always react to
the local events, especially the movements of the ringgit.
	   Judging by today's performance, he said although the ringgit
softened, the rubber market was on the downward trend.
	   This was contrary to other commodities which edged up when the
ringgit's value was made relatively cheaper against the US dollar.
	   The International Natural Rubber Organisation (Inro) daily
market indicator price for May 29 was quoted at 204.77
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 205.77 cents on May 28.
	   The five-day moving average was at 206.88 cents per kg versus
207.65 cents previously.

	   THE medical definition of menopause refers to the cessation of
the adult female menstrual cycle. This occurs because the ovaries
gradually become less responsive to gonadotrophin (hormone)
stimulation causing low levels of estadiol (oestrogen), while
increasing the levels of FSH and LH -follicle stimulating and
leutinising hormones.
	   About three to five years before the last period, a woman's
ovaries begin producing less of two female hormones, oestrogen and
progesterone.
	   This phase is called the climacteric, or perimenopausal period.
The hormonal levels may not decreases in a uniform manner, so she
may experience irregular menstrual cycles and heavy bleeding before
her period end altogether.
	   Up to about 15 per cent of women have no problems when their
periods cease, whilst about 70 per cent experience symptoms that
include menstrual irregularities, hot flushes, mood swing,
insomnia, vaginal dryness, urinary urgency and weight gain.
	   A hot flush is a sudden perception of intense heat over the
upper part, or the entire body and face - caused by dilated blood
vessels, which in turn is related to a decrease in the estrogen
level. Sometimes the face and neck become red, and blotches appear
on the chest, arms and back.
	   These can range from being mildly uncomfortable, to
debilitating.
	   `Night' hot flushes is another dreaded occurrence. Generally,
these flushes can last anything from a few minutes to half an hour.
Left untreated, they usually subside within a couple of years from
the onset of menopause.
	   Statistically, Asians record less incidence of hot flushes as
compared to their caucasian counterparts. In Japan, there have been
reports of this being attributed to a higher consumption of soya
bean, which in turn apparently increases the hormones oestrogen.
	   Interestingly, certain `trigger factors' have been identified
that contribute to higher occurrence of these flushes. They include
spicy food, alcohol, tobacco, hot tubs and sauna, stress and anger
(especially when unexpressed).
	   Thinner women have also been associated with having higher
incidences of hot flushes as compared with their more `rounded'
cousins. This is because fat cells help in converting more of the
adrenal hormones into the hormone oestrogen. Maybe, one of the
biggest concerns associated with menopause is a condition called
osteoporosis. Here, the bone density is reduced due to the
reduction of calcium in the bone matrix, causing it to become
thinner and more brittle.
	   This leads to increased risks of fractures (especially involving
the spinal vertebrae, hip joint and the upper limbs). Family
members should pay special heed to elder women when they complain
of aches and pains, resulting from a fall. Sometimes these symptoms
can be subtle, and patients have been known to walk into clinics
and emergency units, only to have an X-ray diagnosis of a fracture
of the femur or hip joint.
	   Menopausal women also have a higher risk of developing
cardio-vascular diseases, primarily due to changes in their lipid
(fat) profile. This is attributed to an increase in the total
cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein - bad cholesterol)
levels and a decrease in the HDL (high- density lipoprotein - good
cholesterol) level.
	   Another significant change noted by women during their menopause
involves their genito-urinary system and their sex life. Due to the
lack of oestrogen support of the lower genital tract, they
experience vaginal dryness and dyspaurenia (painful intercourse),
urinary urgency, frequency and stress incontinence (uncontrolled
leaking or dribbling of urine when stressed or while straining).
	   So what are the treatment options? Hormonal replacement therapy
has been the mainstream consensus and the standard treatment for
many years. This primarily involves the hormone oestrogen (in small
divided doses), and in some cases progestins.
	   Oestrogen helps prevent further bone loss in osteoporosis,
reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and slows down
atherosclerosis. The dosages vary, and one of the known side
effects of hormonal therapy, is withdrawal or irregular bleeding
after the first few doses or episodes.
	   Hormonal therapy s not without it's share of adverse effects,
and one of the most dreaded ones is the increased risk of
developing endometrial (uterus) and breast cancer - particularly
those who are oestrogen dependent.
	   As such, regular mammograms and breast examinations should be
carried out at least while you are on treatment. Consult your
family doctor or gyneacologist for further advice on this.
	   Of late, the treatment options have widened considerably. There
have been reports of women claiming alleviation of their symptoms
by consuming herbal medicine (ginseng and don quai herbal tea).
Wild yam root extract (rich in a chemical called diosgenen, which
is converted into progesterone), and even Vitamin E (doses ranging
from 600-800gm) and C and evening primrose oil have been advocated.
	   Others claim that acupuncture, yoga and even meditation play a
significant role in `menopause therapy'. Your doctor or pharmacist
could further enlighten you on the therapeutic ranges that are
available these days.
	   Today, menopause is seen more as the gateway to a second
adulthood. If 50 is the old age of youth, then it is also the youth
of this second adulthood.
	   A famous philanthropist in describing menopause, once said:
``The heyday of a woman's life is in the shady side of 50, when her
thoughts and forces, once garnered in the corners of her mind, flow
out in broader channel - revealing a mature, wise lady with every
aspect of her femininity still absolutely intact.''
	   Menopause is certainly NOT a disorder, but like puberty, is a
period of physical and emotional change that affects some women far
more than others.

	   LONG term: Bullish.
	   Short term: Under a cloud Momentum index: +51 Relative strength
index: 41 Observations: Pakistan's successful testing of five
nuclear devices has put this market under a cloud. Industry concern
is that Pakistan, a major customer for Malaysian palm oil, would be
subjected to punitive trade sanctions by the western industrialised
countries and Japan that could seriously hurt its economy and its
ability to finance imports. THe backdrop of a falling US soyabean
oil futures market also is a depressant factor.
	   The active August 1998 contract dived, settling last Friday at
RM2,292 for a RM131 over the week.
	   Conclusion: This market, technically, is still in the thores of
a corrective pullback in prices. However, the fallout from
Pakistan's nuclear tests has pushed it to the edge of the precipice
of the Fibnonacci immediate support level at around the RM2,260
level.
	   Traders may want to make a reassessment of their trading
strategies in the even of a decisive breakdown below that support
level.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid agencies ferried the critically
wounded from quake-devastated villages in northern Afghanistan on
Tuesday and appealed for more aircraft and fuel to rescue survivors
of the earthquake that killed anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 people.
	   In the village of Kol, hundreds of people swarmed a United
Nations helicopter that touched down three days after Saturday's
earthquake struck a remote mountainous area rocked three months
earlier by another massive quake that claimed some 2,300 victims.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, U.N. helicopters evacuated 50 of the most
seriously injured to emergency medical centers. Rescuers have
reached only 29 villages, or about half of those believed to have
been seriously damaged by the 6.9-magnitude quake. Of those, 12
were 80 percent to 100 percent destroyed, said Rupert Colville, a
U.N. spokesman.
	   ``It's now clear that the destruction is very wide spread,''
Colville said.
	   Survivors carried the injured on stretchers of sticks and old
clothes through winding hillside streets and past crumbled
packed-mud houses to reach the helicopters.
	   The villages' remoteness and lack of transportation were
hampering the aid effort. The United Nations, the Red Cross and
other agencies have three borrowed helicopters to deliver medical
aid.
	   The helicopters came from neighboring Tajikistan, and Colville
said he hoped other neighboring countries would contribute as well.
Russia, which has loaned helicopters in previous disasters, said it
would consider sending aid.
	   The lack of aircraft ``is undercutting everything we are doing
now,'' Colville said. The agencies need at least one more cargo
plane to deliver supplies, he said.
	   He said the agencies needed at least one more cargo plane to
deliver supplies that had already been brought into the region
after the February disaster.

	   Dr RAHIMAH A. KADIR: Dental plaque will always exist. Nature
works in such a way that a membrane called acquired pellicle is
formed on the tooth surface within seconds after it is cleaned.
This acts as a net that will catch debris so new plaque is
developed all the time. If it is not removed, it becomes `aged'
with toxins and virulent bacteria.
	   You can help reduce plaque accumulation and virulency in your
oral cavity by maintaining effective toothbrushing procedures and
checking your diet.
	   You are doing fine with the normal routine of brushing twice
daily. But make sure that you have been systematic in your
technique. Be sure to place the toothbrush bristles in the right
place (at the neck of the tooth with one part on the gums and the
other on the tooth surface) when you brush.
	   I suggest you check with your dentist for any other adjunct oral
hygiene devices that can help to alleviate the problem.
	   As for bad breath, it is not unusual, especially upon waking up
in the morning. Most of us miss some parts when brushing at night
so there is bound to be a little debris left over to be devoured by
bacterial plaque.
	   In addition, when we are sleeping our self-cleansing mechanism -
the saliva production and the tongue movement - is reduced.
	   At the same time, if you have been eating a lot of sugared
foods, some of these will be stored in the form of glycogen. Thus,
in a state of `fasting', like during sleep, glycogen will release
its sugar spares for bacterial plaque to act on.
	   The degree of morning breath can, to a certain extent, tell you
how clean your mouth was the night before. The positive side is
that bad breath due to the above do go away after you have rinsed
or brush your teeth.

	   CHINA has assured Malaysia that it will put in place soon a
mechanism to make it easy for Malaysian joint-venture refineries
(JVCs) in the republic in getting their respective palm oil quota.
	   Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said the
assurance was given to him by the relevant authorities of the
republic during his visit to China last week.
	   At present, local palm oil companies operating in China are
given palm oil quotas by the Chinese authorities to facilitate
their operations. The delay in the issuance of new quotas has been
a problem for these companies in the smooth running their business
in the republic.
	   ``I impressed upon the authorities in China that in the interest
of ensuring the viability of the JVCs, they (JVCs) should be given
a quota for palm oil that is at least 50 per cent of their
capacity,'' he said in a statement released in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   As a step to further bolster bilateral trade, Dr Lim said
Malaysia and China have agreed that they pursue the possibility of
using counter trade.
	   In this regard, the prospect of exporting palm oil, timber,
rubber and cocoa products in exchange for corn, rice and beef need
to be explored by the private sector of both countries.
	   He noted that there are already indications that barter trade
between palm oil and corn may be possible between Malaysia and
China.
	   On investment, Dr Lim said China had expressed the hope that the
establishment of a joint-venture pulp and paper mill in Sabah,
agreed to by both countries, will be expedited.
	   ``As China needs substantial amounts of pulp and paper, I
suggested that we explore the possibility of establishing a pulp
and paper mill with oil palm biomass raw material,'' he added.
	   Dr Lim said such a project could tap on the 30 million tonnes of
oil palm biomass available annually in Malaysia without taking
large tracks of land for tree planting purposes.
	   He noted that another possible joint-venture that can be
mutually beneficial to China and Malaysia is the establishment of
rubberwood plantations as China is a large market for furniture.
	   Another area where Malaysian and its Chinese counterparts could
collaborate is in tripartite investment ventures for the
cultivation of oil palm.
	   Dr Lim said Malaysia would provide the management and technical
expertise, China provides the capital and market, while a third
country concerned could provide the land and labour.
	   He noted that his discussion with China's companies during his
visit indicated that there are interests on the part of China to be
involved in these areas of investments.

Ruling Bosnian Croat party splits in two 
</HEADLINE>
By SRECKO LATAL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a blow against
nationalist hard-liners, the Bosnian Croat member of the country's
joint presidency announced Tuesday that he is forming a new party.
	   The move comes after three months before general elections in
Bosnia and months of power struggle in the Bosnian Croat
leadership. It effectively splits the ruling Croat Democratic
Union, ending its years-long monopoly on votes of most Bosnian
Croats.
	   There were no details about the future program and orientation
of the new party founded by Kresimir Zubak. But sources said most
of its members _ several prominent Bosnian Croats, including Zubak
and a few federal ministers _ are considered moderates, supporting
the Dayton peace accord and unified Bosnia.
	   Without additional details, foreign diplomats refused
substantive comment.
	   ``Time will tell,'' said Simon Haselock, a spokesman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp. He said
western powers support ``anything that encourages pluralism,
anything that encourages greater compliance with the Dayton (peace
accord).''
	   But the move clearly pleased outside powers involved in Bosnia
because it weakened the Croat Democratic Union, a traditionally
hard-line party that has turned even more rigid in the past few
months. Nationalists leading the party oppose returns of Serb or
Muslim refugees and other aspects of the Dayton accord.
	   A similar split in the Bosnian Serb leadership last year marked
one of the biggest breakthroughs in Bosnia since the 1995 end of
the war. Western powers used that chance to support Serb moderates
and sideline the old hard-line leadership.
	   The dominant Muslim SDA party also has had to deal with much
stronger opposition from two Social-democrat parties in the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Bosnian Croat sources said the new party will try to run in the
September elections despite the fact that the registration period
for the parties has ended.
	   The international organization charged with the elections will
discuss this issue and try to register the new party in the next
few days, said a western diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

	   SYARIKAT Lian Ping Enterprise Sdn Bhd, an interior design
company, has filed an action to wind up construction based Cygal
Bhd over non-payment of RM3.2 million.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping had claimed in its petition that Cygal Bhd
owes it RM3,135,451.31 for interior decorations done in a hotel
under construction in Johor Baru.
	   Apart from the principal sum, Syarikat Lian Ping is also seeking
from Cygal Bhd financing charges of RM74,907.22 and legal costs of
RM5,000.
	   The company's application, filed on Jan 27, will be heard at the
Kuala Lumpur High Court on June 9.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping said it entered into a contract with Cygal
Bhd, listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange,
on April 12, 1996, to do interior fitting-out for suites and
corridors at Grand Bluewave Hotel in Johor Baru for RM8.3 million.
	   The company said that upon the completion of its work, the
architect of the hotel, MNA Architect, had duly certified payment
to Cygal Bhd.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping said MNA Architect had not recommended to
Cygal Bhd any deductions against the sum due. There were no
circumstances justifying any deduction or set-off.
	   ``Due to the company's (Cygal Bhd) failure to pay (the RM3.1
million), Syarikat Lian Ping has to bear financing charges for loss
of use of the funds.''
	   The company said that Cygal Bhd had failed and neglected to
settle despite requests and demands.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping said that Cygal Bhd had neglected to pay the
amount or any part of it despite being served a demand notice on
Dec 30, 1997.
	   The company said that Cygal Bhd was insolvent and unable to pay
its debts and is claiming that it be wound up with an Official
Receiver appointed by the court.
	   Syarikat Lian Ping said in its petition that Cygal Bhd's
authorised capital was RM100 million divided into 100 million
shares of RM1 each, adding that the amount of capital paid-up or
credited as paid up was RM47,778,000.

	   I HAVE to undergo a major jaw reconstructive surgery because it
was seriously destroyed by a dental tumour (ameloblastoma). Besides
the reconstructive work, all the teeth on the left jaw will be
removed and my jaw will be wired up for two to three weeks to
facilitate the maturing of bone graft.
	   With the removal of the teeth, my doctor suggests tooth implants
or a `bridge'. I wish to know more about these methods and the
cost. As my jaw will be wired up for a long time, I will not be
able to do any oral cleaning. How could I maintain oral hygiene to
avoid infection? Will salt water help?
	   Currently, there is a wound inside my mouth following the
biopsy.
	   Normally, I clean it with salt water, followed by brushing. Will
there be any harmful chemical reaction between the toothpaste and
salt?
	   If I were to do the brushing before the salt water, is it
advisable to leave the salt over-night inside my mouth?
	   - Tsen Kieu Tyng, Luyang, Sabah Dr RAHIMAH A. KADIR: It is
important to know your age for purposes of treatment prognosis.
However, based on your description, it is clear that you will need
either an implant or bridge mainly for functional, and to a certain
extent, cosmetic purposes after surgery.
	   A bridge is a prosthesis that fills up space between two `posts'
or teeth. The two end teeth will undergo special preparation so
that they act as supports. The space between the two `posts' will
then be filled with a specially constructed artificial tooth that
`locks' itself on the two `posts'.
	   Since all your six back teeth on the left side will have to be
sacrificed, implant work will be a better option. The technique
requires surgical procedures whereby screw-like metals are embedded
into your remaining jaw bone. A teeth denture will then be prepared
to fit the space.
	   This denture `clicks' itself onto the screws based on the same
principle of the stud buttons our tailors use on blouses, shirts or
jeans.
	   An implant will cost more because the procedure is more complex,
requires surgery and non-allergic materials are used. The actual
cost of the implant (minus the surgery) will also vary, based on
the type of metal screw or screw system (that is, the Branemark or
the Ankylos system etc) used and the service rendered.
	   Conservatively, if you need six teeth replaced, the cost of
materials alone can run from RM40,000 upwards. Discuss the cost
with your dentist to avoid any misunderstanding.
	   A word of advice, though. Be sure that you get the job done by
qualified professionals.
	   The Faculty of Dentistry, Universiti Malaya, has an implant unit
manned by a team of specialists. For further information or to fix
an appointment, you can call 03-7594881 or write to the: Professor
B.C. Ling Coordinator, Implant Unit, Faculty of Dentistry,
Universiti of Malaya 50603 Kuala Lumpur.
	   You can also e-mail him at bcling  um.edu.my.
	   To answer your other question, there is no harm in using a
mouthwash of warm salt water to help early wound healing. However,
you should not keep salt in the mouth overnight.
	   Given your condition, it is wise for you to be rigorous in
maintaining oral hygiene as you do not want plaque to accumulate.
Use a soft toothbrush and toothpaste with fluoride. You should also
floss the remaining teeth. If you can afford it, buy a portable
`irrigator' called a water-pik. It produces jet sprays and clears
food debris from the teeth.

	   STOCKS tumbled 3.6 per cent yesterday after a government
stimulus package failed to dampen fears over the local economy,
dealers said.
	   The key Hang Seng Index ended off 322.55 points at 8,612.01.
Turnover was HK$6.6 billion. The index opened higher with some
investors encouraged by signs of renewed interest in the property
market at sales of new developments over the weekend.
	   But stocks quickly gave up gains on negative sentiment and a big
drop in the futures market.
	   South China Brokerage vice-chairman Howard Gorges said sales
were across the board.
	   ``This is being exacerbated by short selling in Hang Seng Index
futures,''
	   he added.

	   THE National Centre for Tobacco-Free Kids in the US is the
largest private initiative ever launched to protect children from
tobacco addiction, with funding from American foundations,
organisations and individuals.
	   Its partners are the American Cancer Society, American Heart
Association, American Medical Association, the National PTA and
more than 100 other health, civic, corporate, youth and religious
organisations of all sizes.
	   The centre aims to protect children from tobacco addiction and
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) by: creating a
social, political, legal, economic and ethical environment
conducive to reducing tobacco use by children and exposure among
young ones; developing and achieving related public and private
policies; and, exposing and counteracting the tobacco and allied
industries' strategies and tactics.
	   Three years ago, it set up the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids
with an ambition to be aggressive, work in partnership and think
big. The network of professional and non-governmental organisations
protects children: by raising awareness that tobacco use is a
paediatric disease; changing public policies to limit the marketing
and sales of tobacco to children; altering the environment in which
tobacco use and policy decisions are made; and, countering the
tobacco industry and its special interests.
	   To combat industry's marketing budget, it serves as a resource
and partner for more than 130 groups dedicated to reducing tobacco
use among American youths. It operates a toll-free number of how to
get involved.
	   It disseminates information and implements media campaigns and
events; assists State and community-level programmes; undertakes
research and analysis; co-ordinates with federal, State and local
governments; and engages in advocacy to promote supportive public
policies.
	   Its latest project, Unfiltered Facts, was launched on Sept 15
last year.
	   Packaged in a cigarette-style fliptop box, this comprises
information flash-cards detailing the lethal consequences of
smoking among youths.
	   The cards explain problems such as the number of children who
will die from tobacco-related disease, how many use smokeless
tobacco, and the number of cigarette packs sold illegally to
minors.
	   Special cards tell of admissions by tobacco companies in their
internal documents, about marketing to children and on industry
contributions to US political campaign funds.
	   In five years, the organisers hope to produce another set of
cards -this time with a story of reduced numbers of youth smokers
and cigarette buyers, and of fewer lives being lost to tobacco
addiction.
	   The cards have been distributed to members of Congress and their
staff, public health advocates, and State political leaders and
attorneys-general.
	   This is to remind them that, without action at both State and
national level, children will continue to become addicted at record
rates.
	   Another project, Counter-Ads, fights back against tobacco
advertising.
	   Each month, more than 20 advertisements are placed in national
newspapers and magazines, and on television and radio.
	   It lets Congressmen, State legislators and policy-makers at all
levels know that ``Americans are sick of tobacco companies
manipulating their children'' into an addictive and lethal habit.

ACF Holdings proposes revision of profit guarantee, NEW STRAITS TIMES- MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   ACF Holdings Bhd has proposed to revise its profit guarantee for
the year ended Dec 31, 1997, and also give a full discharge of the
profit guarantee for each of the financial years ending Dec 31,
1998 and 1999.
	   The profit guarantee arose from the proposed disposal of a 33.6
per cent stake in ACF Holdings to Affin Holdings Bhd for RM92.99
million.
	   Pursuant to the profit guarantee agreement signed on Oct 18,
last year, the guarantors and major shareholders of ACF Holdings
had agreed to provide a guarantee of RM63.31 million for the
group's pre-tax profit ending Dec 31, 1997.
	   The guarantors and major shareholders - Trillionvest Sdn Bhd,
Amsteel Corporation Bhd and Lion Corporation Bhd - had also agreed
to provide guarantees of RM46.96 million each for the years ending
Dec 31, 1998 and 1999.
	   ACF Holdings said it had proposed to revise the initial
guarantee in view of the changes in Bank Negara's guidelines on
general provisions from 1.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent and also in
interest suspension.
	   ACF Holdings said the profit guarantee of RM63.31 million was
made on the assumption that the general provision was 1.1 per cent.
	   The classification of loans as non-performing loans when they
were three months overdue had also effectively increased the
interest suspension, it added.
	   Affin Holdings's proposed acquisition of the 33.6 per cent stake
in ACF Holdings (62 million ordinary shares) will result in the
former emerging as the latter's controlling shareholder. It is also
expected to take over the management of ACF Holdings.
	   It was reported that upon completion of the entire exercise,
there were plans to merge Affin Finance Bhd with Asia Commercial
Finance (M) Bhd.
	   Affin Finance is the financial arm of Affin Holdings while Asia
Commercial Finance is a subsidiary of ACF Holdings.
	   Affin will be required to make a mandatory general offer for the
remaining 122.51 million shares in ACF Holdings which it does not
already own.
	   Both Amsteel and Lion Corporation are expected to accept the
proposed offer, subject to approval from their respective
shareholders, where applicable.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - A couple of hours after Bank Negara
announced a negative growth of 1.8 per cent for the first quarter
of this year, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the Government
was working to find ways to reduce interest rates.
	   The Prime Minister said the interest rates, presently 15 to 16
per cent, were very high.
	   Commenting on calls to lower the rates, Dr Mahathir said the
actual lending rate was dependent on the cost of money, inter-bank
borrowings and the margins that banks imposed on borrowers.
	   ``We are under pressure because the so-called market forces want
us to raise interest rates,'' he told reporters after opening the
45th general assembly of the MCA at Wisma MCA.
	   The Government is of the view that when companies get into
difficulties which may lead to bankruptcy as a result of high
interest rates, the Government's finances too would be affected.
	   At a Press conference earlier, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri
Ahmad Mohd Don announced that Malaysia recorded a negative growth
of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year but chalked up a
commendable trade surplus of RM8.808 billion on the back of surging
exports and declining imports.
	   Ahmad, however, expressed confidence that the targeted gross
domestic product expansion of 2.5 per cent for this year was
achievable but he would not say if the second quarter would see
positive growth.
	   Commenting on this, Dr Mahathir said ``we have to accept that
the economy is facing a lot of problems''.
	   Dr Mahathir was also asked to comment on the observation by
Economic Adviser to the Government and executive director of the
National Economic Action Council Tun Daim Zainuddin that
stagflation - a state of high inflation without the corresponding
increase in demand and employment -would be imminent if credit
growth remained at a standstill.
	   The Prime Minister said the Government wanted credit growth.
	   However, when banks were not confident of future performance,
they were normally reluctant to give out loans. Against this, the
banks would have to be ``prodded'' to give out more loans, he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said a whole spectrum of measures were being taken
to help overcome the economic problems.
	   He said Malaysia had to conserve its earnings of foreign
exchange and at the same time minimise spending.
	   ``There is a need to reduce imports, increase exports and trade
in the currencies of the countries concerned.''
	   In this context, Japan has agreed to trade in yen.
	   ``Before this, 70 per cent of our trade was conducted in the US
dollar although actual trade with the United States was only at 18
per cent.
	   ``When the US dollar strengthened, we have problems buying goods
from abroad. When the yen depreciated, we did not get the benefit
because the contract is in the US dollar.''

	   UNION Paper Holdings Bhd recorded an unaudited operating pre-tax
loss of RM3.94 million for the six months ended February 28 1998 as
against a loss of RM6.24 million previously.
	   This was achieved on the back of RM7.95 million in turnover for
the group compared to RM7.85 million before.
	   Consolidated operating loss attributable to members of the
company increased to RM3.94 million for the six months under
review, up from a loss of RM2.97 million for the previous
corresponding period.
	   The group said that with the economic downturn and currency
depreciation affecting various countries in the Pacific Rim,
exports and sales were affected for the half year but of similar
level in turnover compared with the previous corresponding period.
	   Loss per share rose to 22.66 sen for the interim period in 1998
from 17.10 sen before.

	   SOUTH Korea, Malaysia's fifth largest trading partner, is
confident of selling more machinery and industrial equipment to the
local manufacturing sector this year despite the economic slowdown.
	   South Korea exported about RM8.24 billion worth of machinery and
equipment to Malaysia last year. This is more than 70 per cent of
its 1997's total exports of RM11.27 billion to Malaysia.
	   In turn, South Korea imported some RM7.1 billion or about 3.2
per cent of Malaysia's total exports.
	   Korean Trade Centre (KOTRA) trade commissioner and
director-general Im Sungbin said the positive trend and performance
of the Malaysian manufacturing sector in the past three years were
the key factors of the strong demand for higher technology and
equipment.
	   Kuala Lumpur-based Im said among the export-oriented industries
which will continue to buy machinery are the electrical and
electronic, textile, rubber products, wood and related products,
transport equipment and non-metallic mineral products.
	   Im said that 25 Korean companies would showcase their range of
hi-tech machinery and equipment and other industrial products at
the 12th Industry Tradefair Malaysia (ITM '98).
	   The five-day exhibition beginning Wednesday will be held at the
Mines Exhibition Centre in Sungei Besi, Kuala Lumpur.

	   FIRST HARVEST ... (From left) Zainun Ghani, 29, Salmiah Ismail,
43, and Saadiah Abdullah, 39, cleaning a portion of five tonnes of
onions being harvested at a 4.8-hectare plot in Rhu Tapai, Setiu,
which could signal Terengganu's debut as an onion producer.
	   The bulbs, imported from India and Thailand, grew well on the
bris soil in Rhu Tapai, although it all began as an experimental
crop introduced by the State Agriculture Department two months ago.
	   State Agriculture Department director Datuk Sopian Mohd Salleh
said so far two hectares of the land planted with onions had been
harvested and the rest would be harvested soon.
	   The fresh bulbs would need about three weeks to dry. However,
the onions here would be used as stock for propagation purposes as
well as for further research and development.
	   He said the onions grown in Terengganu could become a substitute
for those imported from India.
	   Terengganu has a sizeable area covered with the sandy bris soil,
which was previously thought to be unsuitable for crops, except for
tobacco, but lately, the department has proven that it is suitable
for cash crops like chillies and other vegetables.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The 2,800 SPM and SPMV holders who failed
to obtain places in local universities will know the outcome of
their appeals by June 15.
	   Another 1,000 students who were ``left out'' despite obtaining
good results because of computer errors or mistakes in their
applications, will have their forms checked by Unit Pusat
Universiti against the database of results from the Examinations
Syndicate.
	   Education Ministry's director of higher education Professor
Hassan Said said this at a Press conference today.
	   ``Students (who appealed) who do not receive notification by
June 15 will have to consider their appeals unsuccessful. This also
applies to the `left out' students.
	   ``The notifications will be sent out from June 2. Students in
Kuala Lumpur may receive theirs by Wednesday, while those in Sabah
and Sarawak may have to wait for six to seven days.''
	   Hassan said today was the last day for accepting appeals.
	   ``We must be fair to the universities as the academic sessions
have started. It will not serve any purpose to continue to
entertain appeals as they will never end.''
	   Hassan also advised students not to go to the UPU, but to wait
for the letter.
	   The majority of Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia and Sijil Pelajaran
Malaysia Vokasional holders involved had applied for matriculation
courses, while the rest had applied for degree courses at
Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Institut Tun Hussein Onn, as well
as diploma courses.
	   Hassan said there were fewer appeals from STPM holders and these
would be handled by the universities.
	   He was unable to provide statistics on the latest number of
successful appeals nor the number of seats available for appeal
cases, saying that: ``As the process of vetting the appeals is
ongoing, it is impossible to give accurate figures. Everything will
be finalised on Monday when representatives from the universities
meet to furnish us with the number of places available.''
	   Hassan advised those whose appeals had failed to consider other
options such as Form Six.
	   He said most of the 2,800 appellants were students who failed to
meet the qualifying criteria, but were allowed to appeal ``to be
fair to them''.
	   In contrast, there was a good chance that the ``left out''
students with good results would be accepted.

	   TONGKAH Holdings Bhd is disposing its entire 51 per cent
interest or 3.57 million shares in Tongkah Medivest Sdn Bhd to
Hospital Pantai Bhd for RM35.7 million cash.
	   The proposed disposal would give Tongkah about RM30.38 million
in capital gain, RHB Sakura Merchant Bankers Bhd said in a
statement on behalf of Tongkah.
	   Tongkah intends to use the proceeds to reduce its bank
borrowings.
	   RHB Sakura said assuming that the proposed disposal was
completed on June 30, Tongkah's group earnings would be further
increased by about RM2.26 million for the financial year ending
June 30, 1999.
	   This is as a result of interest savings less the profit
contribution from Tongkah Medivest.
	   RHB Sakura said despite the divestment, Tongkah would still
maintain an interest in Tongkah Medivest through Hospital Pantai,
in which Tongkah holds a 29.02 per cent stake.
	   Tongkah Medivest is principally involved in providing support
services at 19 general, district and nucleus government hospitals
for a concession period of 15 years.
	   Meanwhile, Bernama reports that Hospital Pantai has also
proposed to acquire the remaining 49 per cent equity in Tongkah
Medivest from five vendors for RM26.95 million cash.
	   Amanah Merchant Bank Bhd, on behalf of Hospital Pantai, said
with the purchase, the company would have the opportunity to
broaden its earnings base and would be able to increase efficiency
in relation to hospital support services.
	   The merchant bank said the acquisition would adjust Hospital
Pantai's net tangible asset per share from RM10.39 to RM9.57, based
on the consolidated audited accounts as at Jan 31, 1998 and the
unaudited accounts of Tongkah Medivest as at April 30, 1998.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The 1.8 per cent negative growth recorded
in the first quarter of this year was the first for a quarter since
the mid-1980s, Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don said
today.
	   If the current quarter also ended with a negative growth, it
would meet the accepted definition of a recession - contraction of
the economy in consecutive quarters, he said.
	   At a Press conference this morning, the central bank reported a
real GDP growth of -1.8 per cent for the first quarter ended March
31 of this year compared to 6.9 per cent in the previous quarter
and 8.5 per cent in the first quarter of last year.
	   Asked if the current quarter would also be negative, Ahmad said
a recovery was expected but he would not say for sure if growth
would be positive. For now, he said, the whole-year forecast
remained at 2.5 per cent.
	   As usual, Bank Negara would conduct a mid-year review of all
estimates and forecasts in July, he said.
	   On balance of payments, Ahmad said Malaysia achieved a trade
surplus of RM8.808 billion, up from RM1.674 billion in the previous
quarter, and RM2.022 billion in the first quarter of last year.
	   This was on the back of higher exports of RM69.773 billion
against lower imports of RM60.965 billion (see graphics on Page 2).
	   The central bank has succeeded in reducing credit expansion to
its targeted 15 per cent with April's figure showing 14.7 per cent.
Ahmad gave an assurance the banking system still had sufficient
liquidity to meet the financing needs of the economy.
	   Elaborating on the loans growth cap of 15 per cent, Ahmad
explained that there would still be RM60 billion for the eight
months to December within the banking system.
	   ``For the first four months, we experienced a marginal credit
decline but if we allow loans of RM7.5 billion a month, then we
would achieve our 15 per cent (target).
	   ``We give allowance for variations from month to month but there
is ample room for credit lending. We will stick firmly to this (cap
of 15 per cent).
	   ``There is RM60 billion for the next eight months and it is up
to them (borrowers) to justify and ensure (their projects are)
viable,'' Ahmad commented in apparent pressure recently from
industry to relax lending guidelines.
	   On interest rates, he said viable economic activities had access
to funds at reasonable rates with the various funds and schemes
which have recently been boosted, like for small and medium-scale
industries, export credit refinancing and Fund For Food.

	   ASIAN oil companies, which are mostly Government-owned, will
need to re- examine their relevance in the rapidly changing
business environment, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday.
	   In doing so, the industry will need to re-visit several
fundamental concepts and question some basic assumptions in the
philosophy underlying the industry's orientation.
	   ``Some challenges are clear. Asian oil companies will have to
improve their efficiency and the management of risk because one
misstep can be fatal.
	   ``In such a dynamic environment, the degree of risk is no longer
limited to commercial considerations, but often also subject to
socio-political realities.
	   ``As the oil and gas industry becomes more global, the issues
that need to be resolved would be increasingly complex, thereby
escalating the potential risks,'' Anwar said in his keynote address
at the launching of the 3rd Asia Oil and Gas Conference in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   He said that in order to manage risk effectively, there will be
greater demands for transparency.
	   ``Mergers and alliances, as well as sharing of assets and
resources, are one way to optimise operations as well as share and
spread the risks, given the right partners.
	   ``For industry players from outside the region's energy sector,
you have the choice of becoming an investor or a bystander in the
game,'' Anwar said.
	   He added that in the long term, Asia will continue to remain as
a huge engine of growth of global energy demand, although at a
slower pace in the face of the current economic crisis.
	   Anwar quoted the World Bank as saying that the Asia Pacific
region's energy demand is likely to exceed one third of the global
total by the year 2010.
	   ``Hence, the biggest challenge facing the energy industry in the
Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the oil and gas industry, lies
in meeting Asia's seemingly insatiable appetite for energy.
	   ``Those who choose to stay away do so at the risk of being left
behind by others who seize the opportunities thrown by the crisis.
Because East Asia will bounce back,'' he said.
	   Anwar in his address also said there is no reason to doubt that
East Asia can rise again in the future provided that ``we seize the
moment to institute long-delayed reforms that would rid our
economic and political systems of excesses and abuses.
	   Anwar added that it is imperative that countries of the region
work together in revitalising regional economies.
	   ``We must be aware of evolving trends and new challenges, as
well as be quick to anticipate and recognise threats and
opportunities that may dramatically alter the economic and business
landscape,'' he said.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Talented Alessandro Del Piero, healed
from a right thigh strain which had put at risk his presence at
France '98, on Tuesday was included in Italy's final list of 22
players for the upcoming World Cup.
	   Del Piero inclusion meant the automatic exclusion of Parma's
striker Enrico Chiesa, who had been put on alert as a possible
substitute of the 23-year-old star of Juventus.
	   Del Piero, who was injured during the Champions Cup final
against Real Madrid, will resume full-time training with the
teammates later this week.
	   Del Piero is a considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup.
	   ``Indications of the team doctors (about Del Piero's recovery)
are positive,'' coach Cesare Maldini said Tuesday night.
	   The list also included Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo, a
last-minute substitute for injured No.1 goalie Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Peruzzi, of league champion Juventus, pulled a muscle in
training at Coverciano Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
executive board on Tuesday approved new biathlon events and the
addition of two more women's ice hockey teams for the 2002 Winter
Games in Salt Lake City.
	   The inclusion of men's and women's pursuit in biathlon, proposed
by the international biathlon federation, was endorsed by the board
on the first day of its four-day meeting in Seville.
	   In addition, women's ice hockey will have eight teams in Salt
Lake City. There were six teams in Nagano, where women's ice hockey
made its Olympic debut.
	   Salt Lake City organizers will make a presentation Wednesday to
the executive board on their state of preparations. On Thursday,
they will report to the assembly of national Olympic committees.
	   IOC director general Francois Carrard said discussions were
continuing on the possibility of adding the sport of skeleton _ a
head-first version of luge _ as well as women's events in
bobsledding and ski jumping for 2002.

Ringgit affected by rumour of Bank Negara governor quitting, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   IN another example of the susceptibility of the forex market to
rumours, the ringgit yesterday fell to close at 3.9250/350 to the
US dollar on market talk that Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Ahmad
Mohd Don was quitting.
	   The rumour, which surfaced in the early afternoon, was swiftly
refuted by Adlin Zabri, Press secretary of Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The ringgit, however, failed to recover lost ground against the
greenback which has been firming gradually against all other
regional currencies as well.
	   As it ebbed towards the psychological barrier of 4.0000 to the
greenback, the ringgit succumbed to a short flurry of covering
activities by those short on the greenback immediately after the
rumours surfaced, dealers said.
	   The local unit opened the day at 3.8600/800 but held firm at
3.8560/800 after morning trading. It fell to the 3.9200/3.9300
level after the rumour surfaced.
	   The forex dealers said the rumour was not the main cause of the
ringgit's slide yesterday. It was a factor which showed market
sentiments could be swayed by such rumours.
	   At least, it struck a cord with institutional and corporate
players short on the greenback.
	   In an already jittery forex market lacking fresh leads and on a
day when the greenback further strengthened against the yen, the
local currency could not hold up to any negative rumours, a dealer
said.
	   However, he said, the flurry of ringgit selling to the greenback
was immediate and short-lived with characteristic thin volume. It
later stabilised as the London and Singapore markets recovered from
its reactions to the rumour.
	   ``Of course, there was some effect from the rumour on the
ringgit as the market is jittery with many corporates currently
short on the dollar, a dealer said.
	   ``But the real picture is that the ringgit fell in line with the
strengthening of the dollar to regional currencies like the yen and
the Singapore dollar.''
	   She said there might be a slight overnight reaction in New York
but described the ringgit's slight fall on the rumour as an
``aberration which contributed to the overall bearishness of the
ringgit against the firm dollar''.
	   The local unit also closed lower against the Singapore dollar at
2.3072/395 from 2.2990/091 on Friday, against the yen at 2.8166/248
from 2.7750/842, against the deutschemark at 2.2099/162 from
2.1639/701 as well as against pound sterling at 6.4048/394 from
6.2787/988, previously.

	   THE economic meltdown in South Korea has inflicted the most
suffering on women of the republic, according to its former Foreign
Minister Prof Han Sung-Joo.
	   They are usually the first to get laid-off at a time when Korean
companies are going under and because their labour is unappreciated
they almost always go without severance benefits.
	   He said in a country where male-chauvinistic trends prevail, the
economic meltdown and subsequent emergence of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) era have given South Korean women dual pains.
	   ``One as female workers and the other as housewives in a
Confucian society,'' Han said in his paper entitled ``Currency
Turmoil in Asia: The Strategic Impact'' presented at the 12th
Asia-Pacific Roundtable meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He said South Korean male-dominated society equates female with
lower productivity, so it has taken for granted that female workers
must endure disadvantages in recruitment, promotion, wage level and
job status.
	   ``Simply put, female workers in South Korea get a so-called
`ladies first' consideration when it comes to massive lay offs,''
he added.
	   Han said under the current IMF bailout provisions, the role of
women in the labour force is underestimated and relief policies for
the current massive unemployment inadvertently exclude female
workers.
	   This phenomenon reflects the democratic market system on the one
hand and Confucian paternalistic system on the other.
	   ``Women are merely supposed to help and cheer up their depressed
husbands. Few people pay attention to women suffering lay-off
fears, family fallout, and difficulties at household economy,'' he
added.

	   THE lustre may have paled but there is a lot going still for tin
mining in Malaysia and the mining industry as a whole to warrant
reviving dormant mines. Now is as good a time as any to get back to
basics and look to Mother Earth for sustenance, not to glorify the
heyday of tin prior to the 1985 collapse of the industry but for
sound economic reasons which reflect the sheen in mining still. To
rely mainly on manufacturing to turn the economy around is akin to
putting all the eggs in one basket. It is time mining was given its
due, considering its immense potential and the technology we have.
	   Datuk Mohd Ajib Anuar, chairman of the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market
as well as chief executive officer of Malaysia Smelting
Corporation, brought up a case for the selective revival of tin
mining recently, citing foreign exchange savings and its
contribution to economic recovery if we can reduce our dependence
on tin imports. Malaysia's production of 5,000 tonnes of tin
annually is not enough to meet its consumption of 7,000 tonnes
yearly by the pewter, solder, tin-plating and other tin-based
industries. To maintain its smelting capacity, Malaysia Smelting
Corporation, our sole tin smelter, will have to import the ores.
The volume of refined tin metal exports from Malaysia totals some
30,000 tonnes annually so, if production can be raised to this
level, it will reduce the likelihood of imports.
	   The proposal will also ensure Malaysia's expertise in tin mining
technology is put to good use locally instead of just being
utilised abroad through reverse investments. If the mines are not
reopened, there will be no opportunities to train people and ensure
transfer of technology. If that is the scenario, our expertise in
tin mining technology may well be lost in five years' time. As it
is, many old-timers have diversified into related industries since
the late eighties when tin prices dipped to as low as about RM11
per kg compared with a high of RM29.15 per kg before the tin crash.
The potential for hardrock mining remains to be tapped. In this
respect, the Geological Survey will have to work closely with the
State Governments and identify areas with economic potential for
exploration.
	   For the revival objectives to be met, the States in which the
dormant mines are located will have to be more accommodating
towards miners. At the onset, the States should perhaps approach
the revival of tin mining not on tin per se but view it in a
holistic and integrated manner to incorporate the mining industry
as a whole. Some by-products of mining have added value in their
use as alloys in industries such as aerospace and ceramics.
Minerals such as silica sand are exported to countries such as
Japan where they are developed into silicon wafers for use in the
electronics industry and exported to Malaysia and elsewhere.
	   The renewal of leases and the leasing of land for mining lie in
the hands of the State. Instead of according priority to property
and industrial development, the State Governments should view
mining more positively and make land available for prospecting and
mining. For as long as the tin price remains at at least RM20 per
kg, royalties will flow into the State coffers. Perak has every
reason to cheer as it has been collecting more than RM253,000 in
royalties from tin ore in the past eight months. Under the New
Mineral Development policy, all tin mining States will get to
collect royalty.
	   But understandably, the States are concerned about the
rehabilitation of tin mines and the environmental effects after
mining has ceased. A solution to this is to include Environmental
Impact Assessment reports in project proposals. Mining pools can
serve as a source of water supply in times of need upon treatment
of the water. They can also be transformed into recreational and
tourist attractions. In international tin issues, Malaysia still
holds sway and it is worth the while of State Governments to give
more than a cursory glance to the revival of tin mining on an
integrated basis.

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is also
Finance Minister, yesterday said domestic interest rates must
remain firm -especially since offshore ringgit deposit rates now
stood at about 20 per cent.
	   He said the business community must understand that interest
rates cannot be much lower than the offshore rates as it could
otherwise lead to an outflow of funds in ringgit terms.
	   ``It's very important that people who talk about interest rates
know the offshore rates for ringgit. If you do not take this into
consideration, you are putting the entire financial system at risk,
because what is stopping people from bringing out our funds?''
	   Anwar also denied that a request had been made to the Monetary
Authority of Singapore to assist in bringing down the rates for
offshore ringgit deposits.
	   ``I think it was simply a matter that was expressed in the
Parliament there on all foreign currency deposits in general.''
	   The offshore ringgit deposits in Singapore attracted attention
recently when interest rates breached the 40 per cent mark. They
have eased to about 20 per cent.
	   Malaysia's three-month interbank rates are now more than 11 per
cent, up from 7.5 per cent in July last year, when Asia's financial
problems began.
	   When asked about the statement by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad on interest rates on Saturday, Anwar said Dr
Mahathir was merely expressing the general consensus of the
business community who felt interest rates were very high.
	   He said the Government did not deny the fact that the business
community was facing problems.
	   He explained the policy was to ensure the credit situation
eases.
	   ``I personally believe interest rates should be determined by
market forces.''
	   Asked if they could come down in the near future, Anwar said the
central bank had that option, but high offshore rates for ringgit
deposits must be taken into account.
	   ``The option must be kept open through the central bank. A rate
cut will affect adversely the currency and inflation.
	   ``I personally would like the interest rates to come down but
what can we do when there are so many other factors to take note
of?
	   ``What is more critical now is the easing of credit. This can be
partly resolved by the setting up of the proposed asset management
companies.
	   ``The AMCs will take over part of the non-performing loans of
the country's banks and that should enable commercial banks to
disburse loans to the various sectors of the economy.
	   ``We cannot direct the banks as to who or to which selected
company they should disburse these loans to.
	   ``Not every captain of industry or prominent businessman can
expect that loans must be disbursed to them because of their
position or influence.
	   ``I want to say that such a move will be very unwise.''

	   ASIAN nations have to restructure their economic policies to
bring them in line with the international system and global
Information Age, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk
Seri Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday.
	   He said the Asian crisis came about because of an
incompatibility between the Asian national systems and the
international system.
	   ``Each new stage in economic development requires a new mental
framework,'' he said in his keynote address at the 12th
Asia-Pacific Roundtable meeting in Kuala yesterday.
	   Anwar said the present global economy had passed two industrial
revolutions and it is now rushing into the third industrial
revolution.
	   The first revolution was the age of the steam engine, the second
was the age of motor vehicles and aeroplanes and the third is the
age of the information revolution.
	   ``The information revolution has already set in, but our minds
are trapped in the second industrial revolution. Thus, we have
become T-Rex trying to live beyond the Jurassic age,'' he added.
	   Anwar reiterated that Asian countries have to restructure their
respective economies to bring them in line with the Information
Age.
	   ``A new economic age brings with it new challenges to which
Asian countries have to respond. The road to destruction is paved
with stubborness in sticking to old modes of thinking.
	   ``We can rival any industrial country in constructing hard and
physical infrastructure. But we have not caught up when it comes to
the soft, intangible and invisible infrastructure, that is, a
regulatory framework to ensure transparency and to manage rapid
capital movements,'' he added.
	   While re-inventing these policies to make them in line with
international systems as well as Information Age-sensitive, Anwar
said Asian countries must re-anchor their policies to address the
needs of common people, where wealth-sharing and social justice
must be re-emphasised.
	   ``Asia is at a political and economic crossroads. We must
exercise courage and wisdom. We must choose between satisfying our
jingoism, thereby sliding into the edge of darkness, and taking the
path of reform towards a humane free market economy,'' he added.
	   He noted that it is time for Asia to break out from its
encrusted mould because a new reality that demands modifications in
the conduct of diplomacy is emerging within the region.
	   ``Globalisation, which marches on relentlessly, will re-define
both the role and the sphere of the nation-state. We will become
irrelevant unless we begin to come to terms with the new reality,''
he added.
	   Anwar said the wave of revolution sweeping the region in the
last few years almost paralleled the 1848 revolution that swept
away the last remnants of absolutism and tyranny in Europe.
	   ``The demand for reform, good governance and civil society in
Asia today is an unstoppable force of history. When the people has
truly decided on internal reform, neither the political elite nor
their cronies, be they in business or media or anywhere else, will
be able to withstand the groundswell.''
	   Anwar said in this regard, the conduct of diplomacy must go
beyond and perhaps deeper than conventional notions such as
confidence-building and comprehensive security.
	   ``Confidence-building has not worked precisely because we have
not probed into the roots of suspicion and distrust between states.
	   ``We must constantly remind ourselves that in any conflict it is
always the people, not the state, who pay the price. We must find
ways and means to remove deep-seated suspicions and hostility among
states.
	   ``We must arrest this drift to violence and nuclear adventurism.
We must oppose opportunistic politicians who fan the flames of
jingoism be it in the name of religion or state,'' he added.
	   He noted that Asia remains mired in poverty and destitution
despite being a vast continent, populated by one half of humanity,
and having at least three nuclear powers.

	   EQUIPMENT and funds are urgently needed to fight forest fires
near Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in Sabah, Malaysia. The World
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Malaysia is appealing to the public for
fire-fighting equipment or funds to purchase such equipment to
combat forest fires raging around Batu Putih near the Kinabatangan
Wildlife Sanctuary and Supu Forest Reserve in Sabah.
	   Its project director, Dr Junaidi Payne, in making the appeal
said that forest reserves, the wildlife sanctuary, plantations and
villages alike are at immediate risk of being burned. At risk are
people, homes, the rich habitat and wildlife.
	   Equipment urgently needed are tractors, high-powered water
pumps, hoses, generators, water tankers, shovels, parangs, boots,
safety helmets, face masks, gloves, fuel, food and medical
supplies. Payne said the local community, Sabah Forestry Department
officers and WWF Malaysia staff have been fighting the fires for
the past two weeks. They are hoping to contain the peat fires by
digging trenches and flooding these with water from the
Kinabatangan River. The Wildlife Department is closely monitoring
the situation.
	   ``We are urgently appealing to members of the public,
plantations and companies especially those in the surrounding
areas, to assist us in our efforts. The fire at Supu Forest Reserve
is on peat soil and we are under-equipped to contain the
situation,'' he said.
	   Equipment may be donated or provided on loan. ``We have set up a
co-ordinating office in Sandakan to receive donated or borrowed
equipment, as well as funds for equipment,'' Payne said.
	   Those wishing to assist can contact Robert Chong or Marc
Ancrenaz at Labuk BB, Jalan Labuk, Batu 15 Sandakan or call
089-533190 or call the WWF Malaysia office in Sabah at 088-262420.

	   AMWAY (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd said Mr Choong Lai Huat (pic) will
step down as managing director with effect from September 1, after
having served the company for 17 years in that capacity.
	   Choong, who is the president of the Direct Selling Association
of Malaysia, was also Amway's senior vice president in charge of
markets in Brunei, Indonesia and Thailand.
	   He, however, gave up his regional responsibility for Indonesia
in 1996 and then in Thailand in 1997.
	   Choong will remain a director of Amway and Amway Asia Pacific,
in addition to being appointed adviser to Amway Malaysia.
	   In a press statement, Amway chairman Tan Sri Azmi Wan Hamzah
said ``as far as Malaysia is concerned, Choong has become almost
synonymous with direct sales and it is in our interest to ensure
his continued involvement in the industry''.
	   He described the appointment of Choong as adviser as ``a move to
ensure that he is still consulted on strategic decisions as well as
to tap his vast wealth of understanding and knowledge in direct
selling''.
	   Amway Malaysia's Crown Ambassador, Mr Peter Lee Pang Say, said
Amway distributor organisations will continue to look to Choong for
guidance in his capacity as adviser to the company.
	   Choong will be replaced by Mr Low Han Kee, who is currently
Amway's general manager and executive director, with effect from
September 1.
	   Low, who joined Amway in 1990 as divisional manager (finance 
administration), has been groomed by the company to succeed Choong
ever since he was promoted to the position of general manager in
1993.

	   REEFS are essentially massive deposits of calcium carbonate that
have been produced by corals with major additions from calcareous
algae and other organisms that secrete calcium carbonate.
	   A coral reef is an assemblage of many types of plants and
animals of which corals form one of the dominant components.
	   The basis of the entire coral reef ecosystem revolves around the
ability of the coral polyps to remove calcium ions from the
seawater and deposit them as a limestone skeleton.
	   These skeletons collectively form massive coral reefs. In
addition to coral polyps several coralline algae which also produce
limestone skeletons are considered important in the building and
consolidation of coral reefs.
	   A reef offers an environment upon which highly specialised
creatures have become dependent for their survival.
	   It provides a solid substrate on which many specialised sea
bottom-living organisms such as clams, sponges, sea-fans, anemones
and algae settle and grow.

	   THERE were new stories to tell and jokes to crack when the
Retired Senior Police Officers Association met at its annual dinner
last Saturday at the Renaissance Hotel in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Being used to the decipline in the police force, it was time to
unwind and relax, away from the uniform and the law, for a while.
	   There was no guest-of-honour at the dinner as every one was
considered important and members wanted to do away with formalities
as much as possible.
	   There were, however, some speeches from the organising committee
chairman Mohamad Jamil Mohamad Hassan and association (Restpa)
president, former Deputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Jaffar
Abdul, but both were in an entertaining mood.
	   In fact, the president's speech was not a speech but a string of
lively jokes.
	   Seen at the dinner were association vice-presidents former Johor
Chief Police Officer Datuk Mansor Mohd Noor and Rudy Beltran.
	   Former Sarawak Commissioner of Police Datuk Seri Yuen Yuet Leng,
Respa vice-president former Kedah Chief Police Officer Datuk Mohd
Sulaiman, former Selangor CID chief B.D. Henry and Kuala Lumpur CID
chief M.
	   Balasundram were also there.
	   Former Perak Chief Police Officer Datuk Noordin Omar and former
Perak Special Branch head George Boucher were seen chatting with
former FRU commander and Respa vice-president G.C. Joshi and wife
Mayavanthy.
	   Apart from members, the dinner also saw the presence of friends.
Among them were Segi Impian Sdn Bhd managing director Jeffrey Tan
and Panji Bersatu Sdn Bhd general manager/director Albert Tan.

	   COMMONWEALTH Games Federation (CGF) chairman yesterday took the
Light Rail Transit (LRT) from the Bukit Jalil station to downtown
Kuala Lumpur and gave it the thumbs up.
	   This is the new STAR line connecting Bukit Jalil - the home of
the main stadium and the Games Village - to Kuala Lumpur.
	   It is scheduled to begin operation from July 1.
	   Fennell, who will be back to witness the pre-Games in July, was
impressed with the ride.
	   ``I have read and seen pictures of the system but to take a ride
and see for myself was a different experience. I am sure the
Commonwealth Games delegates and athletes who visit the city will
be surprised to find a hassle free way to travel,'' he said.
	   ``This system is clean, efficient and tidy. I was told that
athletes and delegates will receive free tickets for return trips.
This will surely promote Malaysia.''
	   TWENTY athletes were to have joined Fennell at 9.30am for the
LRT ride to the Sultan Ismail Station in the city but they didn't
turn up.
	   Fennell waited for half an hour before he went on the ride with
the Pressmen.
	   ``I don't know what happened. I am sure there is a logical
explanation,''
	   said Fennell.
	   When Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) secretary Sieh Kok Chi
was contacted, he said the National Sports Council were to have
arranged for the athletes to take the ride.
	   ``We were approached by CGF's Affendi Razali to get the athletes
and we informed NSC liaison officer Ahmad Shapawi,'' said Sieh.
	   ``I don't know what happened.''
	   NSC are looking after the Games athletes.
	   ``The message to the athletes must have got tangled along the
line,'' said Sieh.
	   Shapawi's explanation was that none of the athletes were
available.
	   Meanwhile, Fennell suggested that Sukom Ninety Eight provide
incentives for early bookings: ``The public would only be willing
to spend their money now if there is a discount or certain prizes
to be won by early bookings,'' he said.
	   ``If not, they would wait and buy them during the Games because
the venues are large and there is no likelihood of a sellout.''

	   HAVE you seen a movie lately? At a cinema, I mean. With so many
options available in the market, not many people go to the cinema
nowadays.
	   Besides movies on video cassettes, there are laser discs and
video CDs which are becoming popular.
	   The more affluent members of our society even have home theatre
systems in their living rooms. A friend who had just acquired a big
house has installed a theatre system and I've not been able to get
him out for our usual teh tarik at night since.
	   The days when going to the cinema was part of the local dating
scene are over. I remember when going to the movies was a popular
outing, never mind if the cinemas were dirty, toilets stank and
patrons smoked. The cheapest ticket then was 80 sen and patrons sat
right in front.
	   Those who sat in front usually ended up with stiff necks because
they had to keep their heads at about 60 degrees to the screen.
Those who had corner seats had to make do with a distorted view of
their heroes and heroines. Oh yes, front seats were usually made of
wood and they often creaked a lot.
	   In those days, depending on the particular movie's popularity,
buying tickets can sometimes end in brawls. There was no queue, and
only the strongest and bravest dared to pit their strength. I was
told when the movie Sangam opened at the Odeon cinema in Jalan
Tuanku Abdul Rahman, black market operators enjoyed a small boom as
touts.
	   Nowadays, the cinema comes into the home and all you need is
your favourite drink and kacang. In fact, it's not uncommon to go
through two movies at one sitting, especially when there's a long
weekend ahead.
	   Shops selling and renting out movies, either on videotapes, LDs
or VCDs, are everywhere. If you're a regular, you can even rent
them at a discounted rate. Of course, you have to put down a
deposit, refundable when you end your membership.
	   It was against this background that I went to a cinema two
nights ago. I announced to my family that I was going to belanja
(treat) them and this was greeted with much enthusiasm. I've only
taken them to a cinema once before, during one of the school
holidays ages ago.
	   Armed with two complimentary passes given by Tony, a public
relations executive, I bought additional tickets at RM8 each and
settled down to enjoy Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes in US
Marshals. The children insisted that popcorn and soft drinks were
vital accessories to a good movie, and I duly obliged.
	   The cinema is one of many operated by Tanjung Golden Village, a
joint-venture company set up by Tanjung Public Limited Company,
Village Roadshow Limited of Australia and Golden Harvest Cinemas
Holdings Limited of Hong Kong.
	   In today's language, the movie house is known as a cineplex,
meaning that it's a small cinema located within a much bigger
complex, usually a shopping complex. The cineplex I went to was at
the Mines shopping complex in Sri Kembangan.
	   Today's cineplex are cleaner and look much better. The one I
went to was quite pleasing, with polite counter clerks who seemed
ready to flash a smile at customers. They were clad in pretty
uniforms which gave the cinema operators a somewhat better image.
	   The cineplex foyer was also much better. It was well lit,
air-conditioned, of course, and has a feel-good atmosphere. The
whole cinema floor was carpeted, with seats which offer lots of leg
room for comfort and an unimpeded view. In fact, the floor leading
to the toilets too were fully carpeted.
	   Today's cinema operators also appear more customer-friendly.
There are disabled-friendly stairways with elevator facility for
those in wheelchairs, a plus point any time. The cinema crowd is
also less rowdy, the only interference coming from selfish
individuals and their handphones.
	   Anyway, apart from slight embarrassment at the ticket counter (I
thought the complimentary passes had no expiry date), my family and
I enjoyed the movie.
	   Action-packed movies such as US Marshals must be watched on the
big screen and with the best digital sound systems. So, wherever
you are today, thanks Tony!

	   JOHOR BARU, Sat. - The State Government will discuss with the
privatised Johor Tenggara Regional Development Authority which
party should play the local government's role in the Kejora region.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said today that the State
Government supported the Cabinet's decision to privatise Kejora,
which has areas in both Kota Tinggi and Kluang districts under its
jurisdiction.
	   Ghani was commenting on the announcement by Rural Development
Minister Datuk Annuar Musa on Thursday that the Cabinet had decided
to privatise Kejora, which would become a consortium called
Kejora-YPJ Sdn Bhd.
	   Annuar had also said the Government would set aside RM10 million
annually to help the consortium take on the role and duties of a
local authority, until the State Government had made a decision to
hand over the duties to suitable parties.
	   Ghani said the State Government would suggest that the Kota
Tinggi and Kluang District Councils act as the local governments of
Bandar Penawar (in Kota Tinggi district) and Bandar Tenggara (in
Kluang district) respectively.
	   The Menteri Besar was speaking to reporters after witnessing the
joint venture signing ceremony between the Johor Farmers
Organisation and the Segamat Muslim Orphans Welfare Organisation.
	   Ghani, however, did not rule out allowing Kejora-YPJ Sdn Bhd to
act as the local authority of both Bandar Penawar and Bandar
Tenggara.
	   He said this would be similar to that of the Pasir Gudang Local
Authority, a privatised body carrying out the duties of a local
authority in Pasir Gudang.

Netanyahu says agreement on West Bank pullout by year's end 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that Israel would reach an agreement with the Palestinians on a
long overdue pullout from the West Bank by the end of the year.
	   Israel has been resisting U.S. pressure to turn over an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
return for Palestinian moves to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   Asked by a reporter Tuesday if an agreement on a pullout would
be reached by the end of the year, Netanyahu said ``Yes, sure.''
	   Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said, however, that there
was no timetable for reaching an agreement.
	   Talks between the two sides broke down more than a year ago.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek
said an investigation will be carried out against a major
advertising company which was alleged to have breached retrenchment
procedures.
	   He said if the allegation was found to be true, the company
could expect swift punitive action.
	   ``I cannot disclose the details or name of the company yet
because the investigations will only be carried out on Monday.
	   ``We received the complaint this afternoon and can only proceed
with the investigations when the company opens for business after
the weekend.''
	   Lim was speaking after visiting 37 commercial booths set up at
Dataran Merdeka in conjunction with a two-day concert held there to
promote the Love Malaysia Campaign.
	   On the impending retrenchment of TV3 employees, Lim said he was
satisfied with the way the company's management had handled the
retrenchment, expected to start next month.
	   He also called on workers' unions to approach the ministry first
before going to the Press to air their grievances against
irregularities in retrenchment.
	   ``Going to the Press will not solve the problem but will instead
aggravate the dispute and hamper the ministry's investigation.''
	   On the ``Love Malaysia'' campaign, Lim said the response had
been encouraging with participating companies reporting higher
sales locally and increased overseas demand.
	   The campaign, initiated by a Chinese daily and supported mainly
by MCA was launched in December last year and is aimed at
encouraging Malaysians to buy local products and support the
Government in cost-saving measures.

	   WHEN we mentioned a price of RM3.7 million for the Rolls-Royce
Silver Seraph in this column recently there were a lot of raised
eyebrows. But what's interesting is that we subsequently found out
that the stablemate Bentley models could cost even more.
	   Rolls-Royce, which has owned the Bentley marque since the 1930s,
has kept it as a sportier model. There are two Bentley models which
could easily set you back by more than RM5 million, inclusive of
Malaysia's 300 per cent import tax and 10 per cent sales tax.
	   Topping the list would be the Bentley Azure, the soft top
version of the Continental coupe series. The body is reinforced and
the top has been designed and built by Pininfarina, the prestigious
Italian coach builder responsible for some Ferrari designs.
	   The stunning lines of the Bentley Azure clothe the sophisticated
technology of a 241kph (150mph) sporting supercar. Inside, Bentley
keynotes of walnut veneer and sumptuous leather accommodating up to
four occupants, while the turbocharged and intercooled 6.7-litre V8
engine combines scorching performance with silken refinement.
	   But it's no lumbering giant. Big though it might be, it behaves
very well round corners. Something to do with the Rolls-Royce
adaptive damping on the shocks which gives it a very sporting
performance around corners.
	   On the straight it is soft and comfortable.
	   Although it weighs around 2,608kg (5,750lbs), the turbocharged
V8 moves the Azure to 0-100 kph in 6.7 secs. That's quick for a
heavyweight.
	   Also in the RM5 million category is the Bentley Continental T.
For the drive, thunderous performance is the single-minded intent,
emphatically fulfilled in the latest 420 bhp (312kW) engine. The
6.75-litre V8 propels it to a top speed of 249kph and scoots from
0-100kph in under six seconds.
	   The new Continental T is built to satisfy the most demanding of
drivers and bears a black Bentley badge, a mark of distinction that
signifies the most daring in Bentley performance.
	   If you are one of those who want to make a public statement
about your wealth and status, you couldn't find a better way to do
it than in a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce.

	   Asian currencies sagged in late morning trade, giving up their
early strong yen-inspired gains as traders focused on growing
evidence of economic strain across the region.
	   Fears of a recession in Hongkong, nationwide strikes in South
Korea and expectations of slowing growth in Malaysia all conspired
against Asian markets, dulling some of the positive sentiment from
the calmer situation in Indonesia.
	   Russia's crumbling financial markets added to the clouds over
Asia as traders worried about the contagion effect of problems in
emerging markets.
	   ``With the demonstrations and unrest in Indonesia blowing over,
Asian currencies had started to settle down. But now we're starting
to see more bad news with the real economies,'' a US bank dealer in
Singapore said.
	   ``It's not really a trading scenario where you see one bit of
bad news and sell the hell out of the currency... People are just
not taking aggressive positions anymore,'' she added.
	   The Indonesian rupiah looked set to stay around the
10,500-11,000 region there is some movement on the resumption of
lending by the likes of the IMF and World Bank.
	   The IMF has suspended disbursements of its $10 billion balance
of payments loan, the central plank of the $41.2 billion rescue
package.
	   The IMF's Asia-Pacific director Hubert Neiss said there was no
need to revise Indonesia's structural reform program, but
macro-economic figures needed adjusting.
	   He told reporters after meeting President Jusuf Habibie that the
macro-economic framework had to be adjusted ``to the new situation
that unfortunately even weaker than it was before''.
	   The next round of talks on how to reschedule Indonesia's $80
billion private sector debt will take place on June 1.
	   On the political front, economics minister Ginandjar said
preparing for national polls could take several months, maybe more
than a year.
	   In South Korea, the government said industrial output fell 10.8%
in April year-on-year, compared with a 7.1% rise the year before.
Industrial output fell 10.1% year-on-year in March.
	   The won firmed back through the 1,400 per dollar level as dollar
inflows from exporters outweighed dollar short-covering by players
concerned about labor unrest in the country and the yen's recent
weakness.
	   The Labor Ministry said over 34,000 workers at 18 sites across
the country were on strike as of 0200 GMT. But union officials told
Reuters as many as 70,000 workers at 40 organizations were still
striking.
	   The militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions called a
two-day national strike to protest layoffs.
	   The ringgit was a little lower amid growing fears about
Malaysia's economic outlook and some traders are talking about a
revisit of the 3.90 or even 4.0 level.
	   Malaysian Q1 GDP figures are due this week and a Reuters poll of
economists produced an average forecast of 1.7 percent GDP growth
in Q1. This compared with a 2.8% forecast in a poll conducted at
the beginning of May.
	   The Singapore dollar was on the wrong side of 1.66, with players
targeting the 1.68 level initially amid concerns about the impact
of slowing growth in Malaysia and Indonesia.
	   The Indian rupee opened at 41.30/40 to the dollar and was
expected to range between 41.25 and 41.45 after the central bank's
rate checking dampened dollar buying interest on Wednesday.

Driver implicates Gucci wife in killing, says real killer at large pickup

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - A defendant accused in the slaying of
fashion scion Maurizio Gucci admitted Tuesday that he drove the
getaway car, and implicated Gucci's ex-wife as the mastermind.
	   But Orazio Cicala, a onetime pizzeria operator, threw the case
into confusion when he testified the police had arrested the wrong
hit man.
	   Gucci was shot dead March 27, 1995, as he walked into his office
building in downtown Milan.
	   Nearly two years later, police arrested his ex-wife, Patrizia
Reggiani Martinelli; her longtime spiritual adviser Giuseppina
Auriemma; Milan hotel doorman Ivano Savioni; alleged trigger man
Benedetto Ceraulo; and Cicala.
	   The prosecution says Reggiani Martinelli had Gucci murdered
because he'd halved her alimony to dlrs 900,000 a year and she was
obsessed with gaining control over his estate. She allegedly paid
her co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to carry out the crime.
	   Cicala, a gaunt man in his 60s who used to operate a pizzeria in
the northern suburbs of Milan, was brought out of the defendant's
cage he shares with Ceraulo to take the stand.
	   He portrayed Reggiani Martinelli as the driving force behind the
plan to murder her ex-husband.
	   He said that at the end of February 1995, Savioni and Reggiani
Martinelli came to his home to talk about the plan.
	   A second meeting took place some time later at the Bar Jamaica
in Milan, a bohemian hang-out in the city's trendy Brera
neighborhood.
	   ``We discussed the fact that I was supposed to find the person
who would carry out the crime,'' Cicala said.
	   But he said Ceraulo was not the killer.
	   He described the real killer as a ``dolt'' he'd met when he was
dealing drugs. ``I can't give you his name because I have children
and a family,'' he told the court.
	   He said he decided to confess as ``a matter of conscience,''
saying he was drawn into the scheme because he needed money.
	   It was Reggiani Martinelli's first day in court _ Italian
defendants are not required to attend trial.
	   She sat on the last bench in the courtroom surrounded by
security guards, with rosary beads wrapped around one wrist and a
blue plastic Swatch around the other.
	   Wearing no makeup and dressed in sporty blue cotton slacks and
top, Reggiani Martinelli listened impassively to Cicala's
statement.
	   At one point she appeared ill, and a nurse came rushing in the
courtroom to offer her an injection, which Reggiani Martinelli
refused, saying all she needed was a drink of water.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Top brass at Air France sat down with striking
pilots' unions Tuesday in an attempt to keep the World Cup from
becoming a no-show event for thousands of fans.
	   The walkout at the World Cup's official airline, in its second
day, was already causing scheduling nightmares for teams preparing
for the soccer championship that begins June 10.
	   The president of the state-owned airline, Jean-Cyril Spinetta,
was among officials who opened talks at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) with the
unions representing 3,200 pilots, at the company's headquarters at
Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris.
	   The strike's first round of talks ended about 5 1/2 hours later
and were to resume Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. (1300 GMT), officials
said. There was no immediate word on whether any progress was made.

	   FOR Americans, big and strong still seem to be how they like
their vehicles and Ford's future 4x4 is no exception, by the looks
of it.
	   The Ford Tremor with its high-performance V8 4.6-litre DOHC
five-valve engine, independent rear suspension, all-wheel drive and
aggressive looks, will definitely break new grounds in the 4x4
market. This concept sport utility vehicle is said to be at home on
just about any terrain.
	   The Tremor is a further evolution of the world's best-selling
4x4, the Ford Explorer which was introduced to the Malaysian market
by AMIM Holdings Sdn. Bhd, the local Ford distributor, a little
over a year ago.
	   The Explorer was known for its performance, ruggedness and a
well-packaged interior. It was making great strides in a rather
selective segment of the 4x4 market when the regional economic
problems put a damper on sales. It however, is making great strides
in other parts of the world.
	   The Tremor is expected to eventually create a new niche for a
fun-to-drive vehicle.
	   At the heart of the Tremor is a powerful, all-aluminum 4.6-litre
high performance engine capable of delivering an estimated 380 PS
and 340 foot-pounds of torque at 5,500 rpm. The engine was built by
Ford's Advanced Powertrain group.
	   The Tremor's chassis and suspension are engineered to provide
optimised handling characteristics, without compromising the
refined ride quality associated with the Explorer.
	   The fully independent rear suspension (IRS) has been adapted
from the latest version of the Ford Thunderbird. The nine-inch
Thunderbird IRS was chosen because of its excellent durability and
reliability, making it an ideal candidate for the Tremor's street
and off-road performance needs.
	   According to the manufacturers, even with the significant
changes to the suspension to improve its dynamics on the road,
Tremor's off-road handling and ground clearance have not been
compromised.
	   The front end features a new hood and fenders made from
lightweight composite materials. A large grille opening keeps the
4.6-litre V-8 cool even under the most demanding driving
conditions. Four large round high-performance headlamps, plus two
round fog lamps in the front bumper, emphasise its sporty,
purposeful character.
	   Tremor's rich metallic red paint is enhanced by the addition of
nickel chrome protection panels on the lower body. The rear end has
been extended slightly and the backlight sloped to give the vehicle
a sportier profile.
	   The licence plate mount has been moved from the bumper to the
tailgate and combined with a new integrated tailgate-opening
handle. An innovative roof rack and a rear roof spoiler help to
improve stability.
	   The Explorer is known for its interior packaging, and the Tremor
concept follows this tradition but with a more performance-oriented
theme.
	   Four custom-made leather-covered Lear buckle seats hold the
driver and passengers firmly yet comfortably in position during
even in the roughest off-road conditions. Grab handles are located
near each seat for when the going gets rough.
	   While Tremor is only a concept at this stage, it has been
engineered as a fully driveable prototype and will be used to gauge
public reaction to the possibility of building a production
version.
	   In Malaysia, the Ford Explorer has been on sale since July last
year and has made an impact on the local 4x4 market.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A 17-year-old girl was killed and 17 other
French students when their bus overturned on a highway in
northeastern Spain on Tuesday, a spokeswoman from the Spanish
emergency services said.
	   The girl, Laure Geffroy, was among 44 students and three
assistants on the bus when the accident happened shortly before 6
a.m. (0400gmt), close to the town of Figueres just 40 kilometers
(25 miles) from the French border, Nuria Iglesias said.
	   Two seriously injured students remained in hospital in Figueres
later Tuesday, but 16 others had been discharged after treatment
and repatriated to France, Iglesias said. The other unhurt
passengers were transported back France earlier in the day.
	   No other vehicle was involved in the accident and there were no
indications of technical failure, a police spokesman said.
	   The spokesman said the most likely cause was ``a distraction to
the driver'' but would not confirm reports that the driver had told
police he fell asleep at the wheel.
	   News reports said the students were on their way to a summer
course at the northeastern Spanish town of Sabadell.

Rest easy, Pete: Rios is thwarted in quest for top spot 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cheered on all tournament long by the vocal Chilean
fans, Marcelo Rios was tantalizingly close to regaining the No. 1
spot in tennis. All he had to do was reach the semis.
	   One problem: Carlos Moya.
	   The talented Spaniard used all his weapons Tuesday to defeat
Rios, 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. He spoiled not only the Chilean's chance
for the French Open title _ one he was favored to win _ but also
his chance to regain the hallowed spot he'd stolen from Pete
Sampras for a month this spring.
	   So what was Rios thinking on court?
	   ``I wasn't thinking about it,'' he said. ``I was thinking about
the match.''
	   Well, maybe. But Rios' fans were certainly thinking about it.
With every point he won, they waved a giant Chilean flag. ``Viva
Chile!'' they chanted during the changeovers.
	   Rios has been the dominant player on the tour this season, with
five titles and a 36-4 record. His baseline game is suited to clay,
and he hits his groundstrokes with great power, often jumping up on
one foot to whack the ball over the net.
	   He overtook Sampras on March 30, and became the first South
American to reach No. 1 since the computerized rankings started in
1973.
	   So even though Sampras recaptured the No. 1 spot a month later,
Rios was confident here. And many favored him to win, even before
the early exits of Sampras and No. 2 Petr Korda.
	   ``This to me is Rios' tournament to win or lose,'' John McEnroe
said before the tournament.
	   But nothing is predictable at the French Open, where being a
favorite often is a curse. Last year, Spanish player Alex Corretja
refused to name a favorite, explaining that if he did so, that
person would lose.
	   Moya, the No. 12 seed here, has been ranked as high as fifth in
the world, but is now 12th and has been aiming to crack back into
the top 10.
	   He became the talk of the tennis world at last year's Australian
Open _ for both his dashing good looks and his talent. He upset
defending champion Boris Becker in the first round, then went
straight through to the final, where he lost to Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old Moya had never
gone past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And here at
Roland Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two
previous visits.
	   Moya was at the top of his all-court game Tuesday, and
especially serving well.
	   With Moya leading two sets to one, a crucial moment came in the
fourth set at 4-4, 15-15. Rios was serving. Moya hit a shot and
Rios let it go, thinking the ball had bounced twice on Moya's side.
But the referee said it hadn't.
	   Rios lost the point, the game, and his concentration.
	   ``Maybe if I won that game, the match would have been
different,'' he said later.
	   Moya knew that point had an impact.
	   ``It was bad for him,'' he said.
	   Rios went on to delight his fans by saving three match points in
the last game, including a lucky net cord. But the Spaniard fired
an ace to set up the fourth match point, and Rios netted his final
shot.
	   Now Moya finds himself the highest seed left in the tournament,
and one of only three seeds left _ all Spaniards, who excel on
clay. The others are the No. 14 seed, Alex Corretja, and the No. 15
seed, Felix Mantilla, whom Moya plays in the semis on Friday.
	   Mantilla and Moya are buddies. ``We're going to be friends until
Friday,'' he said.
	   ``When we get to the court, I will try to kill him.''

	   BLUES BROTHERS 2000 - Various Artistes YEARS ago the first Blues
Brothers movie featured a host of soul, blues and RB tracks.
	   It starred Dan Aykroyd as Elwood and John Belushi as Jake.
Belushi died of an accidental drug overdose some years later.
	   This movie, the sequel, follows the same formula.
	   There's blues like the funky Born In Chicago performed by the
Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Cheaper To Keep Her, a lively fun
tune, featuring Dan Aykroyd, Lonnie Brooks, Junior Wells and the
Blues Brothers Band.
	   Looking For A Fox is a retro-soul tune while Can't Turn You
Loose is an engaging big band funk workout.
	   Aretha Franklin blasts out R-e-s-p-e-c-t while Eddie Floyd,
Wilson Pickett and young blues guitarist Jonny Lang show up for the
soul classic 634-5789.
	   One highlight is the gospel--funk of John The Revelator with Taj
Mahal and The Faith Chorale turning in stirring vocals.
	   Funky Nassau is a change of pace, with its jaunty Caribbean
feel, kind of like the music of KC and The Sunshine Band.
	   How Blue Can You Get has nearly 20 world class musicians
performing in it - Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bo Diddley and
Grover Washington Jr, among them.
	   This album is a nice enough collection of classic blues and soul
tracks, if not quite superior to the first Blues Brothers album.
	   ALABAMA - Super Hits II ALABAMA were the biggest- selling
country group in the 80s.
	   Their country sound was sweetened with pop and rock touches and
the more commercial sound was enthusiastically accepted by country
and pop fans all over the world.
	   Alabama have sold over 50 million albums but in the 90s they
seem to have lost some steam, what with the emergence of younger
stars like Garth Brooks and Travis Tritt.
	   However, they have carved out a loyal following, many of them
working-class, and this album is made up of some of their later
hits.
	   Forty Hour Week celebrates the middle-class, and Song Of The
South celebrates patriotism.
	   Some ballads like We Can't Love Like This Anymore and Once Upon
A Lifetime are thrown in for a pleasant mix of contemporary country
music.
	   BIGGEST CLUB HITS ... EVER - Various Artistes THIS dance album
has Prodigy leading the pack with their hit Smack My Bitch Up and
supported by a huge cast like BT, Fatboy Slim, Faithless, Sandy B,
and more.
	   This is a double CD disc set, featuring 20 recent tunes on one
CD, and 10 on the other. So what you get is over 140 minutes of
pulsating, heart- bursting, 140 beats per minute techno music.
	   Great for discos and aerobic workouts.
	   ELVIS PRESLEY - From Hawaii Via Satellite THIS was a live
concert, broadcasted worldwide and seen by billions in 40 countries
around the world. And it was the last TV Special Elvis ever did.
	   Elvis, then in his late 30s showed he can still cut it live.
This Special showcases his versatility in rock, country, pop,
ballads, and folk tunes which he handles with equal aplomb.
	   He performs 27 songs here, ranging from early hits like Blue
Suede Shoes and Hound Dog to his then current hit Burning Love,
plus a playful version of James Taylor's Steamroller Blues and
Suspicious Minds.
	   At the end of the album he performs a few songs from his hit
movie Blue Hawaii.
	   It's a relaxed and rocking set with Elvis being unafraid to make
spontaneous vocal improvisations.
	   The set ends with a reflective folk tune - Early Morning Rain, a
Gordon Lightfoot composition.
	   UB40 - The Dancehall Album EIGHT working class kids from
Birmingham could hardly have imagined when they got together some
20 years ago that they would not only be one of the leading reggae
bands in the world, but also the top British band in that genre.
	   They have released 23 top 10 singles, and 16 albums, and their
worldwide sales are in excess of 30 million units.
	   They continue to promote the music which originally came from
the Caribbean islands.
	   In fact this album is the second of a three album project. The
first, released in June last year, was called Guns In The Ghetto.
	   This one is more ambitious. It is a collaboration between UB40
and the top dancehall stars of Jamaica, like Stichie, Ninja Man,
Lady saw, Pinchers and more.
	   The songs here have the music composed by UB40 while the vocals
and lyrics are by the collaborating artistes.
	   The songs are a purer form of reggae, which might not be to
everybody's taste.
	   But it's hard, powerful stuff, and marginal listeners of reggae
might not be for it.

	   INVESTORS should focus on this year's growth forecast of two to
three per cent, instead of dwelling too much on the negative growth
of 1.8 per cent recorded in the first quarter.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Affifuddin Omar yesterday said
subsequent quarters in the year were expected to show more positive
growth.
	   Also, the Government will increase the injection of cash into
the banking sector this year to maintain sufficient liquidity.
	   ``We expect investors to structure their investment plans in
line with the growth forecast for the whole year.''
	   Affifuddin said the first quarter's negative growth was expected
as the Government had taken steps to restrict the economy's overall
growth for the year.
	   He was speaking in Sri Hartamas, Kuala Lumpur, after launching
the pilot programme for the ``Smartpay Card for the Government
Sector'' for selected Petronas service stations.
	   ``We will wait and see what happens in the second and third
quarter growth which is expected to rise to contribute to the
targeted growth for the whole year.''
	   The Government trimmed the country's 1998 gross domestic product
growth forecast to two to three per cent, down from four to five
per cent announced last December.
	   An initial forecast of seven per cent was made during the 1998
Budget meeting in Parliament in October last year.
	   ``We will meet the two to three per cent growth, and will have
to increase the liquidity of the financial sector and attract more
investors.''
	   Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Ahmad Don had said the banking
sector would have RM60 billion available for lending for the eight
months to December.
	   Meanwhile, the ``Smartpay Card for the Government Sector'' pilot
programme is undertaken by the Government to allow its officials to
purchase petroleum products at Petronas and Shell stations using a
smartcard.
	   It will eventually substitute the current practice by government
officials of using indent slips to purchase products.
	   Affifuddin said the project was established as part of the
Government's efforts to realise a paperless administration and is a
result of an ongoing study on the use of credit cards for
government-related expenditure.
	   The pilot programme involves four departments under the Finance
Ministry and selected Petronas and Shell service stations.
	   Affifuddin said the project would reduce the time and costs of
administering government petroleum purchases from Petronas and
Shell which receive an average of 200,000 transactions involving 11
million purchase documents every month.

	   Close to 30% of the 41,935 barangays in the Philippines had no
electricity in 1996, according to the National Statistical
Coordination Board (NSCB).
	   NSCB, which released the findings only last April, said only
29,530 of the 41,935 barangays in the Philippines enjoyed
electricity service during the period. This finding was based on
data gathered by on a study in 1996 which was released last April.
	   By major island group, Luzon was the most energized with 16,709
of 20,473 barangays enjoying electricity service. Visayas followed
suit with 65.2% of its 11,441 barangays having electricity.
	   Mindanao came in a poor third with about 53.4% or slightly over
half of its 10,021 barangays.
	   On the other hand, electricity reached 96% of cities and
municipalities nationwide Electric cooperatives are responsible for
energizing 89.8% of the cities/municipalities and 81.4% of the
barangays. The Manila Electric Co.
	   (Meralco) distributed power to 7.4% of the cities and
municipalities and 13.9% of the barangays.
	   Residential consumers comprised the biggest block of users at
89.7%. The commercial sector accounted for 7.7%, while the
industrial sector comprised 0.4%. The remaining 2.2% represented
general public uses such as public buildings, street lights, and
water irrigation.
	   Electric cooperatives provided 4,131,749 connections or roughly
more than half of the total connections in the country. Meralco on
the other hand was responsible for 2,869,531 connections or about
36% of the total. Other private utilities handled 839,602
connections.-Chris S. Frondoso

	   THE malice in Sue Grafton's recent whodunit refers to the bitter
sibling rivalry of the Malek brothers who are determined that Guy,
their long-lost black-sheep brother, never receives a penny of his
inheritance.
	   It is left to Kinsey Millhone, the Californian private eye, to
hunt Guy down and bring him home. She quickly succeeds in locating
him and brings back a seemingly sweet, guileless and totally
reformed man.
	   Nevertheless, the Malek brothers are suspicious of this former
junkie, but any chance of getting reacquainted is thwarted when Guy
gets murdered.
	   This is Grafton's 14th novel in a series which names each novel
after a letter in the alphabet. Readers should be warned that `M'
also stands for mundane, monotonous, mediocre! Grafton lacks the
skill of Ruth Rendell and the pacing of Mickey Spillane, and her
novel is obviously formulaic. Set in the world of middle America,
with its trailer parks and middle-aged inhabitants with midriff
spreads, it is far too unglamorous to even be considered pulp.
	   Kinsey Millhone is no Charlie's Angel. She owns one dress, is
hitting middle age, unmarried, childless, and battling a weight
problem and the temptation of sticky buns.
	   Despite owning a gun and having had her nose broken twice,
Kinsey has a tender side. She is instantly drawn to Guy and prefers
him to his older brothers.
	   He naively mistakes his family's renewed interest in him to be
an act of brotherly love. Kinsey breaks the truth to him gently and
tries to protect him from the Maleks. She identifies with his
isolation: ``I was struck by the fact that Guy's circumstances were
oddly reminiscent of mine, both of us trying to assimilate
fractured family connections.''
	   Kinsey becomes emotionally involved in the case and is
devastated by Guy's death. Her emotional wall crumbles further when
former lover Robert Dietz shows up after a break of ``two years,
four months, and 10 days''. Yet even this ex-flame cannot ignite
the soggy embers of Kinsey's long burnt-out passionate side. She
seems delighted when he injures his knee and the question of
whether or not they'll sleep together is hastily swept under the
carpet.
	   M is for Malice has little emotional or dramatic punch. Even
Guy's murder has no impact. The gambling, alcoholic Malek brothers
are too mediocre to be effective villains.
	   The reader is given almost no clue as to who Guy's real murderer
might be, so that when Kinsey inevitably tracks this person down,
his identity and motivation seem far-fetched and obscure. Thus the
avid detective novel reader is stripped of the joy of attempting to
solve the case.
	   The whole story is a series of frustrated realisations: Kinsey
only solves the crime when it's too late. The murderer is a
fictional decoy, clumsily inserted into the plot and Kinsey resumes
a lukewarm relationship with Dietz, which has the erotic charge of
a night in bed with a husband who still wears his socks after 35
years! The ending is a final insipid splurge. Kinsey has a dream in
which she realises her unrequited love for Guy and regrets that she
could not save him. Grafton warns us that her story is not over.
There is limitless turgid prose yet to come to further disgrace the
detective genre.
	   ``What's done is done. What is written is written. Their work is
finished, ours is yet to do.''

	   Q: I AM 40 years old. I used to have spottings two days before
my periods but now I am having them for 20 days, i.e., after four
days of period, I am clean for three days before the spotting
starts again.
	   I used to have a 30-day cycle and then 28 days, and now its
25/26 days.
	   Am I going through menopause? Are there any herbs or vitamins I
can take?
	   I go for a pap smear and scan every year but everything is
normal. I had tubal ligation done four years ago.
	   A: THERE could be many causes for mid-cycle spotting, menopause
being only one possibility. A blood test will tell if this is the
cause. In menopause, the pituitary sends out ever increasing levels
of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinising hormone)
to try and ``wake up'' the ovaries which are becoming sluggish, and
therefore low in oestrogen.
	   So, in menopause, FSH and LH are elevated while oestrogen is
deficient.
	   Another possible cause could be excessive oestrogen (compared to
progesterone). This should also show on a blood test and may be
caused by the intake of chemical oestrogens through food and water.
	   If you eat only organically-fed meats and animal products, and
drink only purified water, this will help to resolve this
particular problem.
	   Herbs such as peony and chastetree, and vitamin B6 with a full
B-complex are also helpful.
	   Other helpful herbs would be beth root as an astringent and
false unicorn root as a uterine tonic and hormone balancer. If the
problem does not improve, you should seek medical advice as there
may be other causes such as fibroids, polyps or endometriosis.

	   PLUM Island is a rare thing - a bestseller with a sense of
humour. Its humour is even more surprising when you consider that
Nelson Demille's American chart-topper is a thriller set in an area
that includes an island (the Plum Island of the title) which is a
site for research into animal diseases.
	   Actually, it's a little more sinister than that. Nobody is quite
sure what does go on at Plum Island but there are rumours abound.
The scientists claim they are looking for vaccines against diseases
like anthrax and ebola, but more cynical and inquisitive souls
suspect that there may be other agendas.
	   How much research is being devoted to cross-over diseases;
diseases that affect animals but can also affect humans? And
despite denials that the United States is doing research into
biological warfare, is that another of the centre's concerns?
	   These local speculations become rather more acute when two top
scientists from Plum Island are found dead on their patio. Tom and
Judy Gordon were two of the research centre's star scientists.
Young, attractive and successful, they had an active involvement in
the local community and a lifestyle that looks beyond their means.
	   A nice waterfront house and a fast and powerful boat don't come
cheap and a post-mortem check through the couple's computerised
financial records reveals that their glamorous lifestyle was too
expensive for their modest incomes. So who wanted the Gordons dead?
And why?
	   Enter the book's narrator, ``John Corey by name, convalescing
cop by profession'', a friend of the Gordons' who is staying
nearby, recovering from three bullet wounds acquired in the course
of his duties as a New York homicide detective.
	   As Corey puts it: ``So you don't think I'm a paranoid citizen, I
should mention that I was convalescing, not from the mumps, but
from three bullet wounds, two 9mm and one .44 calibre Magnum, not
that the size of the holes matters. As with real estate, what
matters with bullet holes is location, location, location.
Obviously these holes were in the right locations because I was
convalescing, not decomposing.''
	   Corey agrees to lend his old friend Max, ``who is the law in
these here parts'', a helping hand, bringing big-city ways to the
backwater of North Fork on Long Island. He accepts a retainer to
look at the bodies and advise on the case, which he does for a
short while. Then the thinly disguised FBI and CIA presence decides
to put out an official explanation of the deaths.
	   Whilst the local township gossips about the Gordons selling a
deadly virus to enemy agents, the worried authorities put out a
story that the Gordons stole a vaccine which they intended to
exploit commercially.
	   Neither story is true.
	   Corey's role in most of this is to ask difficult questions and
irritate government officials. He excels at both to such an extent
that his retainer is terminated and he is left to pursue the case
on his own, unofficially and illegally. Some might also say
unwisely.
	   But Corey is not a man easily deterred. One of his most
appealing qualities is his scepical attitude to authority,
particularly when he believes it to be engaged in an elaborate
cover-up.
	   The Gordons were friends of his and his intuition tells him that
they were not the sort of people they are made out to be. Too many
things about the case do not fit. The official explanations are too
neat and too glib.
	   Corey wants the truth.
	   Much of the book's success, and much of the reader's enjoyment,
derives from Corey's character. A wise-cracking, street-smart New
Yorker with a healthy distrust of appearances, he digs away, both
literally and metaphorically, until he unearths the mystery of Plum
Island and the real story behind the deaths of the Gordons.
	   His occasional partners in this enquiry are two beautiful women,
one a fellow detective and the other president and archivist of the
local Peconic Historical Society.
	   They, too, add zest to the book, but it is on Corey's character
that much of the book's interest, and almost all of its humour,
hinges. The following extract is typical: ``I'm a good interrogator
because I can pick out personalities and types, and tailor my
approach accordingly.
	   ``This doesn't mean I'm simpatico, sensitive or empathetic. I'm
an overbearing, egocentric, and opinionated male chauvinist pig.
That's my comfort zone. But I listen and I say what has to be said.
It's part of the job.''
	   I can imagine readers not liking Corey at all. He is definitely
chauvinistic and arrogant, definitely not PC. But he is also, of
course, all the things that he claims not to be - empathetic,
sensitive and thoughtful. It's just that for large parts of the
book he keeps some of these qualities fairly well hidden.
	   But just as every prostitute in Hollywood has a heart of gold,
so, it seems, does every hard-bitten detective. And very few have
been bitten harder than John Corey.
	   Demille is a very professional writer. Plum Island is well
controlled and it moves smoothly and effortlessly through to its
finale. There are no last-minute surprises, no wholly unbelievable
climaxes and no bids to upstage Hollywood disaster movies.
	   The resolution of the plot is not wholly credible but it does at
least remain consistent to the characters of the people involved.
	   I was never wholly convinced by the real cause of the Gordons'
death but as the book's main appeal is the characters and their
relationships, that seemed less important than it does when the
only interest is non-stop action. And when I apply the oldest test
in the world, I have to admit that Plum Island did well.
	   There are books you read in bed before you go to sleep. There
are fewer books that you read when you wake up in the morning.
There are still fewer that you sneak-read at odd moments when you
really should be doing other things. And Plum Island made me do all
of those!

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, healed from a
potentially season-ending right thigh strain, was included in
Italy's final list of 22 players for the World Cup announced
Tuesday.
	   Del Piero's inclusion meant the automatic exclusion of Parma's
striker Enrico Chiesa, who was a possible substitute for the
23-year-old star of Juventus. Del Piero, who was injured during the
Champions Cup final against Real Madrid, will resume full-time
training with the teammates later this week.
	   Del Piero is a considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup.
	   ``Indications of the team doctors (about Del Piero's recovery)
are positive,'' coach Cesare Maldini told Italian television after
a match in Sweden Tuesday night.
	   The list also included Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo, a
last-minute substitute for injured No.1 goalie Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Peruzzi, of league champion Juventus, pulled a muscle in
training at Coverciano Sunday.

	   ONE square metre of this grass generates about 10 litres of
oxygen per day. Big animals graze on it, little animals live
amongst it, and there are millions of hectares of it around the
world (Northern Queensland alone has about 5,000 sq km). But you
can't use your lawn mower on it - nor would you want to. What is
it?
	   The answer is seagrass. Seagrass is a flowering plant, complete
with leaves, a rhizome (underground, usually horizontally-oriented
stem) and a root system. They are found in marine or estuarine
waters.
	   Most seagrass species are located in soft (that is, silty or
sandy) sediments. Seagrass tends to develop into extensive
underwater meadows that resemble fields of wheat.
	   Eelgrass (or dugong grass), ribbonweed, strapweed and paddle
weed are common names for some seagrass species.
	   Seagrass must have four properties to exist, that is, it must be
adapted for life in a saline medium, be able to grow when
completely submerged and have an anchoring system to withstand wave
action and tidal currents.
	   Seagrass also must have a capacity for pollination in water.
	   Seagrass are pastures of the ocean, providing food, shelter as
well as breeding and nursery areas for many marine organisms,
including fish.
	   They stabilise the sand and mud in which they grow. The
sheltering canopy of seagrass leaves rising in the water and the
net of roots penetrating into the sediments below, create a calm,
stable and protected habitat for a wide assortment of marine life.
	   The grass beds are especially important as nursery areas for
young stages of fish, shrimp and crabs.
	   In Australia, studies show that 90 per cent of all economically
important fish and prawn species depend, for parts of their life
cycle, on seagrass beds.
	   A green leafy feast of rapidly growing seagrass awaits grazers
such as manatees, dugongs (sea cows), sea urchins and green
turtles.
	   Most of the seagrass, however, becomes part of the food chain as
detritus, or decaying matter. Microbes, shrimp, many fish and
others feast upon the decaying seagrass.
	   Seagrass help other organisms by recycling nutrients from the
sediments into the water and by storing energy from the sunlight
into organic matter through photosynthesis, thereby aiding to the
growth of other marine life.
	   Although South East Asia is one of the richest seagrass areas in
the world, our seagrass meadows are threatened by water pollution,
increased siltation and sediment run-off from the rivers and
mainland, trawling, dredging and coastal reclamation.
	   Because they are located within the shallow coastal zones,
seagrass beds are directly affected by the way we treat the land
and what we put into the sea.
	   Ever-growing human population along the coastline increases
development.
	   If we don't manage our land more carefully, we will lose another
treasure from nature - seagrass.

	   Credit Information Bureau Inc. (CIBI) has joined forces with
Standard  Poor's Ratings Services to expand its credit rating
activities in the Philippines.
	   ``The move is not a merger but simply a joint venture in which
both institutions would work together to provide investors with a
more accurate view of the financial market,'' said Eric Greenberg,
business development manager of CIBI.
	   ``There are no major equity stakes involved. We're still working
on proposals, details...on that long-term relationship,'' he said.
	   Greenberg said Standard  Poor's would provide CIBI technical
assistance on rating methodology and analytical training, and
participate in the assignment of ratings.
	   ``The introduction of credit ratings of banks and financial
institutions will deliver a number of key benefits to the rated
institutions and will be an important endeavor in the further
development of the Philippine capital market,'' said Jaime Ladao,
president of CIBI.
	   ``A driving factor of this initiative is the growing need for
greater transparency of financial transactions,'' he said.
	   Standard  Poor's recently downgraded the Philippine's credit
rating for financial institutions for the first quarter of 1998 to
``negative'' from ``satisfactory''.
	   The rating agency declined to give an assessment of the
Philippines' standing but said in a statement that the country ``is
in a very favorable position.''
	   Greenberg said the effect of Asia's currency crisis on the
Philippines ``is moderate compared to other countries. The
Philippine banking system is very well capitalized, very profitable
and very competitive on the global scale.''
	   He said the smooth transition of power following the May 11
elections was also a factor working in the Philippines' favor.
	   Ladao said CIBI had yet to make a formal presentation before the
Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP).
	   ``We hope to start next week after a presentation to the BAP. If
we can get five banks credit-rated this year, then that would be a
good start,'' said Ladao.
	   ``CIBI will be actively seeking to gain leverage off thus
relationship to further expand its ratings of financial
institutions in the Philippines,''
	   he said.
	   Standard  Poor's has been tracking financial institutions in
the Philippines since 1993, and has ratings assigned to 23
entities, including public information ratings on 14 local banks. -

Tuesday against Silvio Berlusconi, asking a court to sentence the
media magnate to 5 1/2 years in prison and fine him 12 billion lire
(dlrs 6.7 million).
	   The case, alleging illegal party funding, is one of a series
against Berlusconi, a former premier who now heads the center-right
opposition.
	   The prosecution also asked for a sentence of 4 years in prison
and a fine of 15 billion lire (dlrs 8.4 million) for co-defendant
Bettino Craxi, a former premier who has refused to leave exile in
Tunisia to face corruption accusations in Italy.
	   ``It's a clear use of justice for political ends,'' Berlusconi,
speaking of the case, told reporters. ``Democracy has suffered a
deep wound.''

	   It seems inevitable that the turn of the Century will be the era
of nuclear proliferation. The only superpower left no longer has a
franchise on a weapon that can wipe out this planet. It is now as
vulnerable as any other country to nuclear attack by a host of
relatively impoverished loose cannons.
	   Little wonder that the US is so intent on dissuading Pakistan
from undertaking a nuclear test that is meant to inform its
neighbors, India particularly, that it too can play an
all-or-nothing game. A Pakistani nuclear test will surely be the
signal for all other countries with nuclear capabilities to beef up
their own arsenals.
	   Not About to Happen Unfortunately, the US position against
nuclear proliferation is untenable.
	   It suggests that the US and selected cohorts can be trusted not
to use their nuclear arsenals for aggression but are silent on
preemptive strikes.
	   So why should countries in war-prone areas not be trusted? The
only reason that such countries as Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq may
agree to defer a nuclear build-up, if at all, is if the US
guarantees to protect them from one another. That is not about to
happen.

Weeping Kosovo refugees describe shelling, claim `ethnic cleansing' officials say 5,000 total

Eds: UPDATES with U.N. now saying 1,600 refugees registered, local

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Shock etched in their faces, ethnic
Albanians fleeing the violence in Kosovo province gave weeping
firsthand accounts Tuesday of a major Serb offensive against
separatists that is fast turning into another all-out civil war in
former Yugoslavia.
	   Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees joining
the growing exodus to neighboring Albania described artillery
bombardments that forced out entire villages, and house-torchings
they said were clearly intended to drive them out.
	   ``It's ethnic cleansing, and it's done the same way as in
Bosnia,'' said Ukshin Maliqi, 35, comparing the situation in Kosovo
with practices in neighboring Bosnia that appalled the world during
that three-year war.
	   ``They shell first so that we abandon our houses, then they burn
them so that we cannot return,'' he said.
	   The accounts provided some of the most detailed information yet
about the scope of the stepped-up campaign launched in late May by
Serb police and army forces, who are trying to crush the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. The militants have been
gaining in popularity and numbers lately after years of
heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the secessionist
southern province, where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of
the population of 2.2 million.
	   There have been no reports as there were in Bosnia of massive
civilian roundups or massacres in the Kosovo conflict, which the
Serbs insist targets guerrillas. But attacks on villages, the
exodus of civilians and the deaths of women and children among the
casualties _ more than 200 people have been killed in the last
three months _ have prompted increasing comparisons to the ethnic
war in Bosnia and its atrocities.
	   President Clinton told a visiting delegation of ethnic Albanians
in Washington last week that, by their account, ``The United States
shall not tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo.''
	   But the West, which has failed in repeated attempts to get
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the crackdown in
Kosovo, has yet to devise a strategy for how to resolve the
worsening conflict.
	   A NATO official in Brussels, Belgium, who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the alliance was ``preoccupied'' with Kosovo and
would debate what to do at a NATO Council meeting Wednesday.
	   ``There is a sense of urgency about this, but it's also
important to base what we do on sound military analysis,'' the
official said. ``You can't improvise military response, you can't
throw troops at problems.''
	   Based on information from the refugees and ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo, the latest campaign is focused on the western
region of Decani, where the Serbs deployed thousands of additional
paramilitary forces and are pulverizing 10 towns and villages with
artillery.
	   The town of Decani, with a population of about 20,000, was in
ruins with no sign of life, according to the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center. Dead cattle littered the streets, it said.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army controls as much as a third of
the province, several refugees said they saw no sign of it in the
sealed-off area under siege from Serb forces.
	   ``When the shelling started we ran to the woods, waiting for it
to stop,'' said Nise Mazrekaj, 27, from the targeted village of
Slup. ``But then the Serbs set the houses on fire, so we couldn't
go back.''
	   Her young three children were crying and hungry after an
overnight mountain journey over goats' paths. Other refugees were
stretched out on the grass asleep, exhausted from their trip.
	   ``There's no way back, no,'' said her husband Sulejman, 39,
distraught from the shelling a day earlier.
	   The Serb attacks appear to have intensified over the weekend,
judging by the stream of refugees that began Sunday morning to
Albania. U.N. officials said 1,600 refugees had registered, but
local Albanian officials said some 5,000 had arrived, many refusing
to register.

	   THE damning reality is that the high interest rate and tight
liquidity are making it impossible for companies and individuals to
borrow even for productive purposes.
	   Even those who qualify may still be turned away by banks which
have exceeded the loan growth target set by Bank Negara or do not
have sufficient funds to lend.
	   It is learnt that some very telling facts surfaced at a special
meeting between Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and
senior bankers in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Also present was the
Economic Adviser to the Government and executive director of the
National Economic Action Council Tun Daim Zainuddin.
	   With the effective lending rate exceeding 15 per cent per annum,
it is cheaper to borrow abroad in the US dollar despite the
depreciation of the ringgit.
	   One source said even at RM4 to US$1, the dollar lending rate
works out to less than nine per cent. As for suppliers' credit, a
well-established Malaysian company can still obtain it from foreign
banks for as low as four per cent.
	   Yet we hear stories of importers of capital goods being chided
for not securing loans from local financial institutions whenever
they go to Bank Negara to seek advice and assistance.
	   With the domestic liquidity remaining tight and banks continuing
to be cautious in offering new loans, partly in compliance with
Bank Negara directives, companies have to look abroad for loans.
	   Some examples have lately emerged to show that foreign banks can
be a lot more supportive of appeals by Malaysian borrowers to
reschedule their loans in order to avoid defaults and avert
bankruptcies.
	   While this may not be the best situation for the country,
businesses are not presented with other viable choices.
	   Understandably, they have to abide by the conditions of the
foreign lenders. It is no longer uncommon for these lenders to
require Malaysian borrowers to subject themselves to examination by
foreign auditors before new and existing loans are disbursed.
	   Lenders are also known to dictate terms, such as cost-cutting
measures and limiting dividend payments.
	   Even after swallowing their pride and losing their independence,
not all Malaysian companies will get access to foreign funds. They
may be either too small or too weak to qualify.
	   If the private sector is to remain the engine of growth, its
access to cheaper foreign capital has to be widened. One way of
doing this is for the Government to borrow abroad and replenish the
domestic banking system with reasonably priced funds.
	   This is the most natural thing to do as the country has lost a
considerable amount of reserves in defending the ringgit. This was
aggravated by the outflow of private funds.
	   Increasing the liquidity of the banking system is an addendum to
the removal of the non-performing loans by the Asset Management
Company.
	   With the NPLs removed, the banks can start lending again. But
some of them do not have sufficient money to do so. They need loans
themselves. It is understood that economies such as Japan and
Taiwan are keen to offer official loans to us.
	   SAVING the financial system is important. Being praised by
International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus and
the foreign media may also be important to some of us.
	   But what good is an inflated ego when the economy is in imminent
danger of contracting, confidence diminishing and the survival of
businesses getting more precarious by the day?
	   Speaking at the 33rd annual meeting of the Malaysian Malay
Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, Daim
warned that stagflation, a state of high inflation without a
corresponding increase in demand and employment, was imminent if
credit growth remained at a standstill.
	   He said a gloomy and uncertain economic climate, fear of
bankruptcies and stringent imposition of lending guidelines had
caused banks to over-react.
	   Daim said based on feedback from banks, it was unlikely that the
15 per cent credit growth for this year would be attained.
	   If we do not want our economy to stall and tail-spin, we should
act quickly to restore the confidence of businessmen, investors and
consumers.
	   As Dr Mahathir has often said, we are both producers and
consumers.
	   Take, for instance, an office worker. He is a producer who sells
his services in exchange for money. But when he spends his money to
buy other people's goods and services, he becomes a consumer.
	   But his confidence is eroding. He is worried about being
retrenched or having his salary reduced. In reaction, he is not
spending as much as he used to.
	   When he does not spend, others who depend on his expenditure
will be deprived of their income. Less consumption leads to lower
output. Lower output means lower economic growth or even no growth
at all. Unemployment and other socio-economic problems will occur.
	   This has happened to us before. In 1985, we suffered negative
growth of one per cent. Yesterday, Bank Negara announced that our
economy registered negative growth of 1.8 per cent for the first
three months of this year.
	   Therefore, maintaining consumers' confidence is important.
Scaring consumers into not spending can only be the work of someone
who does not know the workings of the economy.
	   If we want to avoid a contraction in the economy, we must
encourage consumers to spend, albeit wisely, of course.
	   THE Japanese newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, on Wednesday accused
Britain of ignoring the dark history of its colonial rule when it
demanded that Emperor Akihito apologise for Japan's treatment of
prisoners of war.
	   ``There has been almost no mention of an apology by Britain for
the darker episodes of its colonial rule,'' the newspaper said.
	   It said Britain was the largest colonial power before World War
II and was responsible for many barbarous acts, such as the 1840-42
Opium War.
	   But it had hardly offered any apology to its former colonies.
	   The newspaper noted that when Prince Charles attended the
handover of Hong Kong to China on June 30 last year, he gave a
self-congratulatory assessment of British rule of the territory.
	   Yomiuri quoted British historian Dennis Judd as saying Britons
were good at glorifying their own past, but failed to notice the
hypocrisy of their views.
	   It said the British Empire at its peak included colonies that
were the sites of massacres and tragedies.
	   When Prime Minister Tony Blair apologised for his predecessors'
failure to help Irish victims of a devastating famine 150 years
ago, he was criticised by the media and historians. They complained
that the Government did not have to apologise for something that
took place a long time ago.
	   Coincidentally, just days before Yomiuri published the
criticisms of Britain, The Times newspaper in London printed a
report on Dutch statesman Hendrikus Colijn whose exploits in
colonial Indonesia are being debated in the Netherlands.
	   Headlined ``Hero status of bloody colonialist questioned'', The
Times said the debate had been unleashed by the disclosure that
Colijn, one of the country's most respected politicians, took part
in war crimes in Bali.
	   In a letter to his wife a century ago, Colijn wrote: ``I had to
put nine women and three children, who were begging for mercy, on
to a pile and have them shot. The soldiers took pleasure in
sticking the bayonets into the natives.''
	   During the massacre in 1894, Colijn, then 25, lit up a cigar. He
was leading a punitive expedition against a Bali prince who had
objected to the Dutch opium trade.
	   Local women and children defended their homes and were
slaughtered. In all, the Dutch killed 2,000 Balinese.
	   In 1904, Colijn was still writing with pride about his
adventures. He wrote: ``It made no sense to go to war if one could
not shoot women and children.''
	   After his colonial activities, Colijn, who is regarded as a
founding father of modern Dutch politics, became Army Minister in
the First World War. In the inter-war years, he was six times Prime
Minister. After retiring from politics, he became chairman of Royal
Dutch Shell.
	   Now Dutch critics are arguing that his name should be removed
from street signs and a full history written. He died on Sept 18,
1944.
	   AT home, another chapter is being written in our history when
former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib was on
Friday found not guilty by an Australian court of charges of making
a false declaration involving A$1.2 million cash.
	   The verdict aside, there are several things said or which
transpired during the trial to which we may want to give some
thought as they affect our image in the eyes of the world.
	   Muhammad may find paying cash in transactions running into
millions of ringgit speedier than using telegraphic transfer, which
he claims took weeks to clear. But for him to say it is normal for
Malaysians to carry a lot of money when they travel abroad is not
only incorrect but also damaging to our image.
	   To begin with, there are not many Malaysians who can afford to
lug around A$1.2 million in hard cash. In any case, hauling a
briefcase weighing more than 19 kilogrammes, as Muhammad did when
he was carrying his cash in Australia, may be too strenuous for the
average person.
	   He told the court he preferred to use cash after his purchase of
an 11,000-acre farm in Queensland for A$3 million was delayed
because it took several weeks to clear his telegraphic transfer.
	   Perhaps, Muhammad was unlucky when it comes to using telegraphic
transfers because I have yet to hear of such a delay unless there
are irregularities.
	   As for the testimony of an Australian language expert that
Muhammad's command of English is poor, may I urge Education
Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak to improve the teaching of the
language in our schools, colleges and universities.
	   The expert who conducted a test on Muhammad told the court that
he failed by scoring 53 per cent when the passing mark was 60. He
said Muhammad took 20 minutes to understand the currency
declaration form.
	   The moral of the story is that one can have a lot of money, but
may still not understand national and international rules governing
the conveyance of currency.
	   Muhammad told the court he bought properties abroad ``to cushion
the effect of recession in Malaysia in the 1970s and mid-1980s
which taught Malaysians not to invest everything back home.''
	   He said the Malaysian Government encouraged the people to invest
abroad although it wooed foreign investors. But to be fair to the
Government, a qualification has to be made.
	   True, it encourages Malaysians to invest abroad but only in
productive projects so that they can bring home profits. I do not
think the Government means to encourage Malaysians to buy private
properties overseas.
	   At the time of his arrest, Muhammad, who was a Menteri Besar and
Umno vice-president, together with his wife, had not one but five
properties in Australia.
	   Now that Malaysia is facing economic problems, and the
Government is urging the people to bring back their money, Muhammad
may want to sell his overseas properties and bring home the much
needed foreign exchange. Or isn't Malaysia safe enough?

	   JAKARTA (JP): Opposition figures held an unprecedented
celebration of Pancasila Day here yesterday, a date never formally
recognized during the Soeharto era as the birthday of the nation's
ideology. Megawati Soekarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's first
president Sukarno, fervorishly challenged anyone who doubted that
June 1 not Aug. 18, 1945, was the anniversary of Pancasila. ``There
shouldn't be any doubt about Pancasila's birthday, as first
president Sukarno said that it was June 1, 1945,'' Megawati said
questioning the reasons behind such a deliberate neglect of
historical fact. ``Was it because the declaration came from the
mouth of Sukarno?'' she asked. There has been much debate about
when exactly the state ideology was first coined and the marking of
Pancasila's birthday has depended much on historical
interpretation. According to history books, during a June 1, 1945,
meeting of the committee to prepare Indonesia's independence,
Sukarno delivered an hour-long speech containing the five
principles of Pancasila. Then the night after the declaration of
Indonesia's independence on Aug. 17, 1945, the committee which was
preparing the 1945 Constitution adopted the five principles with
several modifications to the wording and order. The final version
was contained in the 1945 Constitution which was officially issued
on Aug. 18, 1945. Judging by the prominent individuals and packed
crowd at the Pancasila building on Jl. Pejambon, Central Jakarta,
Megawati, the ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI), was apparently not alone in her historical belief. Also
present were former governor Ali Sadikin, former minister of
foreign affairs Roeslan Abdulgani and chairman of the Indonesian
Democratic Union Party Sri Bintang Pamungkas. Megawati maintained
that any claims that the birthday fell on Aug. 18 was a
misunderstanding of history. ``If I assume the June 1, 1945, as the
birth of a baby, then Aug. 18, 1945, should be considered as the
issuance of the baby's birth certificate,'' she said, adding that
``June 1, 1945, was Pancasila's birthday, while Aug. 18, 1945, was
the declaration of Pancasila.'' ``But the most important thing now
is whether people can implement the principles of Pancasila in
their daily lives or not?'' Ali Sadikin said yesterday's
celebration was part of the effort to revise history which he
claimed had been engineered during Soeharto's rule. Dozens of
Megawati supporters were seen outside the building carrying posters
and banners expressing the same sentiment. ``Abolish Soeharto's
version of history,'' one banner said. Meanwhile, Ruslan called on
the people to be united in the reform struggle. ``Reform leaders
should be cool-headed and understand the very goal of reform,''
Ruslan said in his written speech. He reminded people that the
reform effort was far from finished, adding that resistance to true
reform measures may come from elements of the former regime within
the new government.

	   PAYA Jeras State Assemblyman Datuk Saidin Thamby will hold
discussions this week with the Shah Alam Municipal Council over
poor drainage causing flash floods in Phase 2 of the low cost
project at Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh.
	   He said the floods had become a major problem for residents.
	   He said the developer should accept the responsibility for
upgrading drains in the housing estate.
	   Saidin added that existing drains could not cope with the volume
of water from housing estates in the vicinity.
	   ``After several housing projects were built, the drains cannot
cope with the volume of water. Therefore, they overflow,'' he said.
	   ``The developers should have upgraded the drainage system first
before undertaking the housing projects. At the moment, all new
housing projects are using the same drains to channel water to the
river.
	   ``The developer was supposed to submit the upgrading plan to
MPSA for approval before starting on other housing projects but the
company has not done so.''
	   He said this after launching the Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh Phase
Two Low Cost Residents Association.
	   He said he visited the area several times during the floods and
noticed that water rose nearly a metre.
	   He added that the residents had complained several times to MPSA
but their effort seemed futile.
	   Phase two has been occupied the past 10 years.
	   Meanwhile, Saidin said, 1,200 residents were squatting on their
property as the lease on it had expired.
	   This was because the sale and purchase agreement stated that the
lease on the land was for only 10 years while the lease for the
house was 99 years.
	   ``I do not know how this could have happened. Normally, the
lease for the property is for 60 years or 99 years. I suppose they
did not read the agreement before signing it. Anyway, I have
forwarded 800 applications for extension of lease to the District

	   ``Some of the residents refused to apply as they are afraid of
the premium they will have to pay.''
	   Saidin said he will negotiate with the District Office for a
nominal fee.

	   Lopez-owned Bayan Telecommunication Inc. (BayanTel) has awarded
to Northern Telecom (NorthTel) a $30-million contract covering the
installation of a substantial number of telephone lines in several
of the former's service areas in Metro Manila.
	   Based on the agreement signed by the two parties, NorthTel will
undertake the setting up of 60,000 landlines in Navotas and Manila
as part of BayanTel's telephone expansion program.
	   Last November, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)
gave BayanTel a provisional authority to put up a total of 150,000
in Manila and Navotas as a reward for having completed its
300,000-telephone rollout obligation ahead of the required time
period as prescribed under Republic Act (RA) 7925.
	   RA 7925 requires international gateway facility operators and
cellular mobile telephone service providers to install at least
300,000 and 400,000 lines, respectively, three years after
receiving their local exchange authority.
	   Under the service area scheme, Manila and Navotas belong to
Eastern Telecommunications Phils. Inc. (ETPI). Since it still has
until November 1999 to complete its own line requirement, ETPI
filed a petition with the Court of Appeals (CA) to stop BayanTel's
incursion in its service areas.
	   The CA has since dismissed ETPI's petition, paving the way for
the expansion of BayanTel's coverage.
	   Under Executive Order 109, the service area scheme assigns each
carrier, except Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., a limited
zone for their telephone rollout programs.
	   BayanTel's original service areas were Quezon City in the
National Capital Region and cities in the Bicol region. By the time
it was granted a franchise to install phones in Manila and Navotas,
it had already exceeded its own line obligation by 28,028 lines.

Youth transit security teams deployed ahead of World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Faced with stubborn youth violence as the World Cup
approaches, the Paris transit authority has deployed a new and
subtle weapon: more youths.
	   Like Guardian Angels in the United States, the first of 350
youths in white and maroon jackets reading ``Mediation'' began
patrolling subway trains this week with no other weapon than the
power of persuasion.
	   The youths are to advise commuters, report vandalism or other
incidents and seek to calm aggressive youths with mediation
techniques.
	   The trained ``mediators'' are aimed at reducing urban violence
that has triggered protest strikes by transit workers in many
cities across France in recent months.
	   Hired on a youth job program launched last year by the leftist
government, the 350 ``mediators'' are to be deployed by the end of
the year, French media reported.
	   The nationwide program has already begun in other cities like
Lille in the north. The program has had generally positive results,
though some of the mediators in Lille were attacked by a gang in at
least one incident.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government is set to lower prices of various
generic drugs by 10 percent this week in consideration of the
public's declining purchasing power.
	   H. Sampurno, the director general for the supervision of drugs
and food, was quoted by Antara as saying yesterday that Minister of
Health F.A. Moeloek had approved the plan.
	   The reduction is the third phase of the government's campaign to
make available medicines at affordable prices, he added.
	   Drug prices soared shortly after the economic crisis hit
Indonesia last July. The rupiah has plummeted in value against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The government initially reduced soaring prices of generic
medicines by 34.35 percent in February. The second reduction, by 18
percent, occurred in April.
	   In the same month, Moeloek -- speaking as health minister in the
Cabinet of former president Soeharto -- promised to do anything
within his means to ensure a steady supply of medicine,
particularly generic drugs, for one year.
	   He cited the government's allocation of a US$116 million subsidy
to the country's pharmaceutical companies for the import of raw
materials for drugs.
	   The Japanese government has also extended a grant for medicines
and medical supplies worth Rp 80 billion to ensure their
availability in Indonesian hospitals, he added.
	   Antara quoted Omar Hamid of the Front Action for Reform in
Health Affairs as saying yesterday that the price reduction often
did not apply in the market.
	   ``In the first reduction, in reality the prices of generic drugs
in the market only declined by 12 percent. In the second reduction,
prices in the market went down by only 5 percent,'' he said.
	   The health ministry has opened a hotline for complaints on food
and drugs at (021) 426334 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

Labor unions call for ILO pact ratification, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesian trade unions are calling on the
International Labor Organization (ILO), which begins a three-week
convention in Geneva today, to press the Indonesian government to
adopt ILO conventions in order to ensure the protection of workers'
rights.
	   The call was made by all 13 trade unions grouped in the
government-sanctioned Federation of All Indonesian Workers Union
(FSPSI) and the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI).
	   Ali Samioen, chairman of the tourism sector union, said the 13
sectoral trade unions recently sent a letter to ILO headquarters
urging the organization to press the Indonesian delegation to
commit Jakarta to signing ILO Conventions Nos. 87, 105, 111 and
138.
	   ``We have also lobbied international trade unions to press the
ILO meeting to issue a resolution on labor conditions in Indonesia.
	   ``FSPSI will not participate in the Indonesian delegation to the
meeting if the government is not committed to ratifying the ILO
conventions,'' he said after a meeting of the 13 sectoral trade
union leaders here yesterday.
	   The Indonesian delegation, led by Minister of Manpower Fahmi
Idris, was scheduled to leave for Geneva last night to attend the
three-week ILO meeting.
	   ILO Convention No. 87 covers issues pertaining to the freedom of
union, No. 105 is on migrant workers, No. 111 on discrimination in
employment and No. 138 on minimum wages.
	   ``In line with globalization and reform, the government has no
other choice but to ratify the ILO Conventions to help protect
workers' rights and improve their social welfare,'' Samioen said.
	   Recognition
	   SBSI chairman Muchtar Pakpahan said his organization had also
sent a petition to the ILO.
	   ``We are optimistic that developed countries and international
trade unions participating in the meeting will press the Indonesian
delegation about the conventions,'' he said after officially
registering SBSI at the Ministry of Manpower yesterday.
	   During the reign of President Soeharto, FSPSI was the only
recognized trade union across the country.
	   The secretary-general of the manpower ministry, Suwarto, said
yesterday that the government was ready to officially adopt ILO
Convention No. 87 and would soon deliver it to the House of
Representatives to be ratified.
	   However the other conventions are still being considered.
	   ``If the others are found to be effective in helping to protect
workers' rights and improve their social welfare, the government,
in the spirit of reform, will certainly consider adopting them,''
he said.
	   Pakpahan expressed some satisfaction yesterday that the
government had altered its adverse stance against SBSI.
	   He welcomed the government's positive response to finally
recognize SBSI as an independent labor union.
	   He said he would continue his struggle to fight against the
abuse of workers and campaign to strengthen workers' bargaining
power.
	   ``SBSI will be involved in the National Tripartite Board and the
National Wage Committee to evaluate and set regional monthly
minimum wages,'' said Pakpahan, who was released from jail only
last week.
	   SBSI, established in April 1992, was banned by the government in
1994 when it held its first congress in Cisarua, Bogor, West Java.
	   Many of its activists, including Pakpahan, have been
interrogated several times and even jailed for organizing
industrial strikes and workers' rallies.
	   Jamsostek
	   About 300 workers from Greater Jakarta and Bandung, West Java,
staged a demonstration at the Ministry of Manpower to protest
alleged corruption in the state insurance company PT Jamsostek.
	   The workers held a free-speech forum in front of the ministry
building in South Jakarta, as they waited for more than three hours
for Fahmi to return from a meeting.
	   Setyono, coordinator of the Association for Action of Indonesian
Workers (KABI), said that the Attorney-General's Office should
conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged rampant
corruption in the company, including the use of Rp 7.1 billion
(US$620,000) to finance the deliberation of the controversial labor
law.
	   In late 1997 then minister of manpower Abdul Latief admitted
that Rp 3.1 billion of Jamsostek funds were used to help finance
the deliberation of the bill. But he later claimed that he had done
it under the orders of then president Soeharto.
	   Setyono led the chorus of dissatisfaction against the
controversial bill and the misuse of funds.
	   ``The money embezzled by the company's officials belongs to
workers. We gave our money to be collected to improve workers'
livelihoods, not to be embezzled,'' he charged.
	   The demonstrators also demanded the government review the
controversial law which they said neglected workers' rights.
	   Setyono said that the law should be reviewed because it was the
product of former president Soeharto's repressive government.
	   The law is scheduled to come into effect on Oct. 1.
	   After failing to meet the minister, the demonstrators were
received by Suwarto who said the government was awaiting inputs
from various sides, including law experts, the House and workers,
before deciding to amend the law.

Kuerten disqualified in doubles for throwing racket at umpire AP Sports Writer

	   PARIS (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten, who won the French Open singles
title last year, was disqualified in doubles Tuesday when he threw
his racket at umpire Bruno Rebeuh _ hitting a fan in the stands.
	   Kuerten, who made a storybook run to the men's title last year
as an unseeded player and became a fan favorite at Roland Garros,
was knocked out in singles last week in the second round.
	   He faces a fine because of Tuesday's outburst. Tournament
referee Gilbert Ysern said he was unsure whether Kuerten could be
suspended for the incident.
	   ``Hopefully, we can give him (Kuerten) the benefit of the doubt
and think that he didn't really aim at killing the chair umpire by
throwing the racket at him,'' the referee said.
	   Ysern said the fan hit by the racket apparently was not hurt.
Witnesses said the fan was hit in the shoulder.
	   ``He lost his mind a little bit,'' Ysern said. ``The chair
umpire could have been hit, maybe hurt by the racket. It's
obviously a serious situation. It's a serious case.''
	   Kuerten and Rebeuh were not available for comment Tuesday.
	   The incident evoked memories of John McEnroe's disqualification
from the 1990 Australian Open for throwing a racket, an incident
that led to $6,500 in fines for McEnroe.
	   At Wimbledon in 1995, American Jeff Tarango stormed off court in
the middle of a match and accused the umpire _ Rebeuh _ of
favoritism. Tarango's wife slapped Rebeuh.
	   That incident resulted in a fine and a one-year suspension from
Wimbledon for Tarango.
	   Kuerten was teamed with fellow Brazilian Fernando Meligeni in a
doubles match against Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman and Australia's
Patrick Rafter on the Suzanne Lenglen Court.
	   ``At the end of the first set tiebreaker, he threw his racket
that went just past the chair umpire and went into the stands,
hitting someone in the stands,'' said Stefan Fransson, a Grand Slam
supervisor, who witnessed the incident. ``He threw it from around
the service line.''
	   There had been disputes about line calls during the tiebreaker,
which the Brazilians lost.
	   Benjamin Deshayes, an usher at the match, said the incident
happened moments after the end of the tiebreaker.
	   ``Kuerten threw his racket at the umpire, but the umpire ducked
and the racket went into the audience,'' Deshayes said. ``Kuerten
got the racket back from the audience and threw it on the ground.''

Gov't Likely to Approve 200,000-MT Sugar Import, BUSINESS DAILY

	   The Department of Agriculture (DA) may likely approve the
importation of 200,000 metric tons (MT) of raw sugar to cover the
shortfall in domestic production.
	   This developed as Agriculture Secretary Salvador H. Escudero III
hinted that he would act on the recommendations of the Philippine
Sugar Millers Association (PSMA) for the importation of the raw
sugar next month.
	   PSMA Executive Director Jose Mari Zabaleta noted that during the
conclusion of the consultation between consumers, sugar producers
and government, the tariff to be imposed on the importation would
the tax applied for imports within the minimum access volume (MAV)
which is 50%.
	   Zabaleta pointed out that if the incumbent administration
approves their recommendation next week, the first batch of raw
sugar is expected to arrive in July.
	   He stressed, however, that the intention of the importation was
to cover the shortage and not to compete with the domestic
production and that the prices of domestic sugar would remain
stable.
	   Zabaleta added that they were still determining the actual
source for needed supply but mentioned that possible choices
include Thailand, Australia, South Africa and several countries in
South America.
	   Escudero, for his part, admitted that importation of the
200,000-MT raw sugar would still depend on the President.
	   ``If the President approves the importation, he will issue an
Executive Order directing the National Food Authority (NFA) to
facilitate the importation,'' the DA chief said.
	   Under the Philippine commitment to the General Agreement of
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the tariff to be imposed is 50% if the
importation is within the MAV, while a 65% duty will be imposed if
the sugar is sourced within the Asean and 80% if it is sourced
outside the Asean.
	   Zabaleta said the crop production for 1997-1998 reached 1.8
million MT which is inadequate for the required yearly consumption
of more than 1.9 million MT.

	   YOGYAKARTA (JP): The local chapter of the Association of
Indonesian Journalists (PWI) are calling on National Police Chief
Gen. Dibyo Widodo to resign over the failure of his force to solve
the 1996 murder of journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin.
	   The call was issued in an official statement signed by chairman
Oka Kususmayudha and was read to reporters by the association's
secretary general Rakiman D.S. here yesterday.
	   Rakiman said the statement had been sent to Gen. Dibyo, Armed
Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, the Yogyakarta Police chief and Sri
Roso Sudarmo, the regent of the town of Bantul, where Fuad lived
and was murdered.
	   Rakiman said the association had assisted police conduct their
investigation into the killing, but still they had failed to
discover who murdered the Bernas journalist, who was better known
as Udin.
	   ``It's now 21 months since Udin was killed and the police have
yet to make progress with their investigation,'' he said.
	   Udin was attacked by a gang of unidentified people in his Bantul
home, 30 kilometers south of Yogyakarta, and died in a hospital in
the city on Aug. 16, 1996.
	   The police, during the course of their investigation, arrested
and arraigned Dwi Soemadji, alias Iwik, as the single defendant in
the case, but the local district court finally acquitted him in
Nov. 1997, citing insufficient grounds for conviction.
	   Many observers, including the local chapter of the PWI, believe
that Udin's murder was linked to critical reports he prepared on
land appropriation, the embezzlement of funds, and the renomination
of Sri Roso for a second term as regent of Bantul.
	   Udin said in one of his reports that a powerful local figure
offered to support Sri Roso's renomination in exchange for Rp 1
billion, which the regent had to send to the Dharmais Foundation
chaired by former president Soeharto.
	   Sri Roso admitted to having agreed to the deal, but claimed
never to have paid the sum demanded.
	   Rakiman said several local police officers, including former
Yogyakarta Police chief Brig. Gen. Mulyono Sulaiman and former
chief of the Bantul police precinct Lt. Col. Ada Subardan, should
be questioned over the failure of the investigation.
	   ``The police should also reinterview all witnesses, especially
those who saw Udin being assaulted. Local officials in Bantul
should also be questioned,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of members of the Bantul chapter of the
Association of Muhammadyah Youths (AMM) lodged a protest with the
Bantul regency council over the failure to solve the case. They
also urged Sri Roso to step down for his alleged involvement in
Udin's murder.

	   San Miguel Corp. yesterday announced its board approved the sale
of 50 million shares out of its 212.3 million shares in Coca-Cola
Beverages (CCB), a spin-off company of Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages is set to take on the European businesses of
Coca-Cola Amatil where San Miguel holds a 25% stake.
	   In a statement, San Miguel said Coca-Cola Amatil had engaged SBC
Warburg and CS First Boston to run the book building process for
Coca-Cola Beverages.
	   The process will match the demand and supply of CCB shares and
set the initial trading price of CCB shares in their initial public
offering.
	   San Miguel shareholders in their annual meeting last month
approved the sale of its stake in Coca-Cola Beverages.
	   The statement gave no other details about the sale.
	   With the spin-off, Coca-Cola Beverages will handle Coca-Cola
operations in Eastern Europe while Coca-Cola Amatil will retain the
Australian, Philippine and Indonesian operations.
	   San Miguel said that Coca-Cola Amatil shareholders will have to
approve the acquisition by Coca-Cola Amatil of the South Korean
bottling operations.
	   The demerger of Coca-Cola Amatil's European operations from its
Asia Pacific operations is conditional on the approval of CCA
shareholders scheduled to meet on June 22.
	   Coca-Cola Beverages, which will be floated on the London stock
market in July, earlier said it plans to buy The Coca Cola Co.'s
bottling operations in north and central Italy as part of the
demerger.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie said yesterday there would
be no change in the government's policy on East Timor, according to
Ambassador-at-large on the East Timor issue F.X. Lopez da Cruz.
	   ``The President gave the message that no matter who the
president is, the position of Indonesia on the issue of East Timor
remains unchanged,'' da Cruz said after a meeting with Habibie at
Bina Graha presidential office yesterday.
	   The former Portuguese colony integrated into Indonesia and
became its 27th province in 1976. But the United Nations and most
nations still view Lisbon as the official administrator of the
territory.
	   Indonesia and Portugal are currently involved in a dialog
sponsored by the United Nations to seek a peaceful solution to the
East Timor problem.
	   Commenting on demands from abroad for the release of jailed East
Timorese rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, da Cruz
said Jakarta's position remained as stated by Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ali Alatas.
	   Alatas said last week that Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year jail
sentence here for undermining the state and for possessing illegal
weapons, was convicted on criminal charges and as such was not
eligible for release.
	   Gusmao was head of the armed wing of the East Timorese
pro-independence movement when he was arrested in Dili, East Timor,
in 1992.
	   Habibie has pledged to release political prisoners as part of
the government's pledge for political reform. Excluded from the
plan, however, are those who were involved in the aborted communist
backed coup in 1965, those convicted on criminal charges and those
who attempted to replace the state ideology Pancasila.
	   In Semarang, Minister of Justice Muladi confirmed the plan to
release 15 East Timorese students arrested for staging
anti-integration demonstrations.
	   ``They will be released within the week,'' said Muladi in a
meeting with an association of East Timorese students, reported
Antara.

	   The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) holds its general membership
meeting today in an effort to finally put to rest the self
regulatory organization (SRO) issue which has hounded the local
bourse for over a year.
	   PSE President Jose Luis Yulo expressed optimism that a majority
``yes'' vote on the changes in the Exchange by-laws can be reached.
	   ``Majority will attend the meeting and we have the vote... the
amendments have already been approved at the board level and this
is simply for ratification,'' Yulo explained.
	   He pointed out that with the imminent ``yes'' vote from the
brokerages, the Exchange would have complied with all the
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
	   ``I believe we have complied with the requirements, but the SEC
is still the one that will grant the SRO,'' Yulo said.
	   Amendments to the rules will be implemented once the PSE gets a
51% nod of approval from its member-brokers. After which the local
bourse takes the amendments to the SEC to meet the June 1 deadline
imposed by SEC Chair Perfecto Yasay Jr.
	   The SEC and PSE had reached a compromise wherein the
Commission's compliance and surveillance department can operate
independently, but with the Exchange's president still having the
authority to suspend any investigation at any time as he may deem
necessary.
	   Should the PSE still fail to make the deadline on Monday, Yasay
had promised to impose stiff sanctions against the PSE, including
the threat to suspend the license of the Exchange to operate.
	   An official at the PSE said that 140 brokers, or 75.68% of the
total members of the Exchange, signified their intention to attend
today's membership meeting.
	   The figures could be deceiving as the official indicated that 46
brokerages, or 33% of those attending, will be represented by
proxies. This leaves only 94 brokerages, or 50.81% of the total
membership being represented by their nominees.
	   Yulo said most of the nominees have taken a ``sabbatical leave''
and are out of the country.
	   Voting will be done through the count of persons who will raise
hands either for a ``yes'' or a ``no'' vote on the amendments.
However, Yulo said that it was most likely that member-brokers
would ask for a secret balloting. --Rodel A. Alzona

	   JAKARTA (JP): Emboldened by the success of student
demonstrations for reform in major cities, fishermen, farmers and
other groups are holding rallies to call attention to their own
causes.
	   Many of yesterday's demonstrations were to demand that certain
officials resign due to alleged corruption. In Purwokerto, a small
town in Central Java, for instance, 200 farmers of Nusamangir
village, Kemrajen district, rallied to demand that village chief
Fuad Mahruri resign for allegedly embezzling about Rp 50 million.
	   Some villagers have accused the chief of embezzling the funds
for youth activities. Fuad has denied the charge and blamed the
demonstration on agitators.
	   In Semarang, the capital of Central Java, about 100 students of
the local Teachers Training Institute marched to the provincial
legislative council to demand that the body does not renominate
Governor Soewardi for the 1998/2003 period.
	   In a meeting with several legislators, the students noisily
demanded that the councilors state in writing that they would not
renominate Soewardi, whose policies have been criticized as
benefiting only a handful of people at the expense of the majority
in the province.
	   ``Soewardi does not deserve to lead the province, because all
this time he has dismissed the aspirations of the people,
especially that of Moslem scholars and intellectuals,'' one student
said.
	   In Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi, more than 800
students demanding the resignation of Governor Z.B. Palaguna faced
off yesterday with 200 members of a youth group who support him.
	   Soldiers and police quickly positioned themselves between the
opposing groups. The demonstrators lined up about 10 paces apart
and traded shouts and epithets on the grounds of the local
legislature buildings.
	   Yesterday was the fourth day the students occupied the
buildings. They have vowed not to leave until Palaguna, whom they
have accused of corruption and nepotism, steps down.
	   The students carried banners calling for reform. Their
opponents, members of the youth wing of Indonesia's largest Moslem
organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, wore green T-shirts and held posters
inscribed ``Reform Is Already Underway,'' according to Reuters.
	   More than 100 students have also entered their fifth day of
occupying the local legislature in the city of Jambi in central
Sumatra, Antara reported yesterday.
	   The students, from Sultan Thaha Saifuddin Institute for Islamic
studies, have accused local officials of allowing gambling to
flourish in the district, and claim they will not leave the
premises until all slot machines are destroyed.
	   In Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, hundreds of students,
fishermen and farmers also used the momentum of the reform campaign
to hold their own rallies.
	   They visited the Medan legislative council, the North Sumatra
provincial legislature, and the governor's office. Most of the
protesters demanded an end to corruption, collusion and nepotism,
but also added their own grievances to the list of social ills.
	   For instance, the fishermen demanded that the government stop
foreign trawlers operating in their waters as they threatened their
livelihood.
	   The same group also demanded that the Provincial Prosecutor's
Office investigate alleged irregularities in the selling of land
belonging to a state-owned plantation to Siti Hardijanti Rukmana,
the eldest daughter of former president Soeharto.
	   Military
	   Separately, chief of the Wirabuana Regional Military Command
Maj. Gen. Suadi Marasabessy was quoted by Antara as saying that
public demands for governors and regents to resign could not be
approved just like that.
	   ``We should first study the demands, whether they really
represent the whole community, or just a small group of people,''
said Suadi who oversees all provinces in Sulawesi.
	   ``There should be due legal process,'' he said in Kendari, the
capital of Southeast Sulawesi. ``You can't think that because at a
national level, demonstrations forced the (former) president
(Soeharto) to resign, you can do it here.''
	   The Armed Forces, he said, would support the campaign against
corruption, collusion and nepotism as long as it was conducted in a
constitutional manner and was supported by facts.
	   Meanwhile, it was reported that relatives of Governor Palaguna
and regents in South Sulawesi had been transferred from various
posts because they were thought to have obtained the posts through
political and familial connections.
	   Among those affected were Andi Henny Bataramaya, a daughter of
Palaguna; Andi Amelia Malik, daughter of the head of the provincial
development planning agency; and Andi Abubakar Amir, son of the
Bone regent.
	   Spokesman of the provincial administration, Baso Machmud, said
the governor was committed to promoting reform throughout his
administration.
	   Civil servants ``who obtained their jobs through collusion,
corruption and nepotism should gracefully resign before they are
forced to do so, because we will be consistent in our campaign for
reform,'' Palaguna was quoted by Antara as saying.

	   The Philippine National Oil Co.-Coal Corp. (PNOC-CC) is eyeing
the construction of a central coal terminal with an estimated
investment of $552 million.
	   PNOC-CC recently signed a memorandum of agreement with Kawasaki
Steel Corp.
	   on a feasibility study for the construction of the terminal.
Cagayan de Oro City has initially been eyed as a possible location.
	   An industry source said negotiations for the construction of the
coal terminal already started with Philippine Sinter Corp. but
disclosed that the talks are likely to bog down because Philippine
Sinter's asking price was too high.
	   Financing for the terminal will be obtained through loans and
equity share from PNOC-CC creditors.
	   The central coal terminal will act as a storage and receiving
facility with an estimated capacity of 20 million metric tons per
year. Its prospective customers will be local cement plants and the
state-run National Power Corp.
	   Aside from the construction of a coal terminal, PNOC-CC will
also develop the Lalat and Integrated Little Baguio coal mines in
Zamboanga del Sur through joint ventures agreements with Filipinas
Systems Inc. and Taiwanese Overseas Mining Co., respectively. The
said joint ventures were approved by PNOC-CC board of directors
early last year.
	   PNOC-CC was established in 1981 to provide a steady supply of
quality and low-priced coal through expansion and diversification,
and to ensure coal price stability in the market. --Angel G. Alegre

Phillies take Burrell with first pick in baseball's amateur draft AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Miami third baseman Pat Burrell was taken by the
Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday as the No. 1 pick in U.S. Major
League Baseball's amateur draft, and controversial outfielder J.D.
Drew went to the Cardinals on the fifth pick.
	   Burrell, 21, has a .426 average, 17 homers and 47 RBIs in 115
at-bats going into Tuesday's game against Long Beach State at the
College World Series.
	   ``I'm thrilled to have been selected,'' said Burrell, who found
out as the Hurricanes warmed up at Omaha, Nebraska. ``It is an
honor to be the first pick overall, and I look forward to playing
professional baseball.''
	   While a sore back sidelined him for part of the season, the
Phillies say he's healthy now.
	   Oakland used the second pick on Michigan State left-hander Mark
Mulder. Mulder was 6-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 113 in 84 2-3 innings
for the Spartans.
	   The Chicago Cubs then took outfielder Corey Patterson, who hit
.560 with 22 homers, 61 RBIs and 36 steals this season for Harrison
High School in Kennesaw, Georgia.
	   Kansas City used the fourth selection on Stanford left-hander
Jeff Austin, 12-4 with a 3.11 ERA and 136 strikeouts in 133
innings. He had eight complete games in 18 starts.
	   St. Louis then took Drew, selected by Philadelphia with the
second pick last year.
	   Drew, seeking a dlrs 10 million contract, turned down a deal
from the Phillies that would have guaranteed him dlrs 3 million and
given him a chance to earn dlrs 3 million more. The former Florida
State outfielder played in the independent Northern League last
season rather than sign.
	   Minnesota used the sixth pick on Arizona State left-hander Ryan
Mills. who pitched six strong innings Sunday in Arizona State's 9-2
victory over Miami. Mills, whose father Dick made two appearances
with the Boston Red Sox in 1970, is 8-3 with a 4.32 ERA and 133
strikeouts in 108 1-3 innings.
	   Cincinnati took outfielder Austin Kearns from Lafayette High
School in Lexington, Kentucky and Toronto took shortstop Felipe
Lopez from Lake Brantley High School in Altamonta Springs, Florida.
	   With the ninth pick, San Diego took third baseman Sean Burroughs
of Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. He is the son of
former major leaguer Jeff Burroughs _ taken by the Washington
Senators with the No. 1 pick in the 1969 draft and the American
League MVP with the Texas Rangers in 1974.
	   Texas used the 10th pick on Northeastern first baseman Carlos
Pena.

	   SEMARANG, Central Java: In response to the outcry against the
renomination of incumbent Governor Soewardi, the provincial
legislature as decided not to place him on the list of nominees for
the upcoming gubernatorial election.
	   ``The decision by the four factions was taken because almost all
levels of society have expressed their refusal to see Soewardi run
for a second term,'' said Toyfoer, chairman of the United
Development Party (PPP) faction here.
	   ``We, of course, are following the aspirations of a majority of
the people who reject Soewardi,'' he added.
	   He explained that none of the four factions at the provincial
legislature -- Golkar, the United Development Party, PPP and the
Armed Forces -- had nominated Soewardi and thus he would not be
called up in the upcoming selection process with the other five
candidates.
	   It was Soewardi who introduced the ``yellowization'' campaign
prior to last year's general election.

More Collateral to Cover Orient's Bad Debts Sought, BUSINESS DAILY

	   The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has required
Chinese-Filipino retailer Jose Go to submit more collateral to
cover over P6 billion worth of bad debts saddling Orient Commercial
Banking Corp.
	   In an interview yesterday, BSP Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes
told The Business Daily titles to prime properties submitted
earlier by Go were insufficient to cover Orient Bank's
non-performing loans.
	   Go founded Orient Bank and reportedly got a majority of the
bank's non-performing loans.
	   ``New collateral will have to be given because, even though the
appraisers have already assessed the properties, these were still
not enough.
	   Definitely, the assets are not enough. That is what we are
discussing now,'' said Reyes.
	   One asset the central bank is asking as collateral is the Ever
Gotesco Grand Central Mall north of Metro Manila. Ownership of the
property, however, is being contested before the Supreme Court by
the Kalookan city government.
	   Some 316 titles, including those covering Go's personal assets,
have already been submitted to the BSP to set in motion the
rehabilitation of Orient Bank.
	   Orient Bank has been on holiday since Feb. 13. Bad debts
extended mostly to its owners and stockholders led to the bank's
closure.
	   Asian Appraisers, one of three companies government hired to
assess Orient Bank's assets and liabilities, completed its
evaluation last week. The Development Bank of the Philippines and
Cuervo Far East Ltd. had yet to submit their reports.
	   Depositors of Orient Bank earlier agreed to keep some P1.5
billion in the bank's vaults.
	   The BSP has asked Orient Bank to hold on to at least 60%, or P2
billion, of the money deposited in its vaults to ensure a smooth
rehabilitation.
	   Orient Bank has been asking its depositors to sign a statement
assuring they will not withdraw their money when the bank re-opens.
	   Central bank officials have warned a bank run could threaten
plans to lure another commercial bank to invest in Orient Bank.
	   The BSP earlier agreed to restructure P3.4 billion worth of
pending claims provided depositors keep their money with Orient
Bank to make the bank more attractive to prospective investors. -

	   Leadership in this country tends to follow public opinion. It
should be the other way around. Leadership that follows public
opinion is reactive, it cannot set its own agenda. The result is
the death of vision and all stagnation. Economists tell us,
pre-occupation with demand (the equivalent of public opinion) also
causes stultification, lack of excitement and progress in the
economy. If Bill Gates was pre-occupied with demand, he would have
invented a better typewriter, not the operating system which made
possible the desktop, personal computer.
	   Politicians in our country remain powerful because the
government is still the biggest source of wealth and power. In
mature economies, that source is the individual entrepreneur. As
with banks which intermediate wealth, so politicians intermediate
power. Both banks and politicians are powerful because they are the
keepers of the gates, quite simply. Banks right now don't need
entrepreneurs. They survive from consumer finance. Politicians
don't need entrepreneurs either. Instead, entrepreneurs need them.
This is why our markets are topsy-turvy.
	   Interest rates remain high and the Bangko Sentral can't do
anything because here, banks monopolize the sources of capital. In
the more advanced countries, the equity and bond markets are
excellent and often cheaper capital sources. Not just their
corporations, but municipal governments (municipal bonds), the
internal revenue (revenue anticipation notes), and even private
hospitals (hospitals bonds) issue bonds. As a result, banks are
forced to compete for the public's money with them, sweetening
their loan deals with reduced interests.
	   Despite the financial squeeze gripping many Asian countries, no
serious calls for more State control of the economy are heard. This
is a good sign.
	   What we do need is more economic direction, not control. Control
is no longer the magic button in the new global order, but
strategic market engagement. But for us to have that, we must have
a clear map of the future, to be provided only by an industrial
policy which will foremost give us development and trade
parameters. The new administration must do everything to have at
alst a firm, industrial policy we're willing to implement.
	   The new President has a tough mandate. The expectation of the
poor for him to deliver will be too much. He must do it
step-by-step, starting with peace and order. He must be tough and
to some extent, unforgiving and repudiative of friendships which
may clash with public interest. And he must know early on the
unique psychology of Filipinos, which determines the kind of
governance suited for them. Generally Filipinos grow up in the
milieu of tigas ni Itay and pagmamahal ni Inay. If a President is
both tough and caring to all the people, he will go down in history
as the one who made the Filipino sprout wings! Special processing
zones have been truly helpful to our economy in providing jobs and
in increasing Philippine exports. But the goods coming from them
are mostly foreign goods assembled or packaged here. We should
shoot to produce Filipino branded goods for both the local and
international markets. The UP Los Banos is where scientists now
involved in agricultural development are based. There should be a
counterpart to UP Los Banos for industrial products, where Filipino
engineer/investors from abroad can work to develop local industrial
capability. The DOST compound in Taguig is a good starting location
for such a facility. There shold be at least two more -- one each
for Visayas and Mindanao.
	   The plan of the new finance department to concentrate on the
2,000 biggest taxpayers must factor in the ideal that the support
of the State belongs to all, not just the rich. In truth, BIR
should get its medals not by milking the rich as much as it can,
but in getting every citizen to pay his and her tax properly. The
goal is to make everyone realize that citizenship is a reciprocal
relationship with government. The latter protects you andcreates
the environment that enables you to advance your own welfare. In
turn you must support it so that it can precisely do all that.
	   The new Intellectual Property Office still waits for its
Director General.
	   The patent office must be so used that it becomes an instrument
for national development. Patents are extremely valuable
properties. For some US companies, the moneys coming from their
infringements constitute the bulk of their income. The open seas
are no longer the battleground for trade wars; patents are. The
improvement of the capabilities of the patent office should be a
priority of the new administration, so that it can adequately
support local invention and all those wishing to extract value from
the technical know-how already available here and abroad. The
improvement can start by giving the patent office its own building.

	   Oil refiners will need to raise petroleum product prices by as
much as 44 centavos a liter on average to cover increases in the
landed cost of crude and a weaker peso, a top oil company official
said yesterday.
	   The official, who asked not to be named said that the average
cost of Dubai crude in May has gone up to $12.74 a barrel from the
previous month's $12.23. The peso, which was an average of 38.40 to
a dollar last month, has weakened by about a peso.
	   These additional costs translates to an average 20-centavo per
liter increase, the official said.
	   He added that crude cost and the foreign exchange rate in April
compared to March resulted in additional costs to the industry
amounting to an average 24 centavos per liter price increase.
	   ``All in all, that's 44 centavos a liter of additional cost that
we have to recover. We are waiting for Petron to make the move,''
said the official.
	   Petron Corp., which is 40% owned by Saudi Aramco, is the
Philippines' largest refiner.
	   Oil company officials said that with increasing competition,
they could not readily raise prices for fear of losing market
share.
	   The country's two other refiners are Pilipinas Shell Petroleum
Corp., a member of the Royal Dutch/Shell group of companies, and
Caltex Phils. Inc., the local unit of the joint venture between
Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp.
	   Prices of petroleum products in the Philippines are deregulated
except for regular gasoline, kerosene and liquefied petroleum
gasoline -- products largely used by the masses.
	   Under an oil deregulation law passed in February, the oil firms
will be able to freely set the prices of these three products only
after five months from the law's enactment.
	   The state-run Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) last raised prices
of these three regulated products on May 18. The oil refiners kept
prices of the deregulated products unchanged.

of the Philippines (ICP), Kapisanan ng mga Kimiko sa Pilipinas
(KKP), Philippine Association of Chemistry Teachers (PACT), and
Philippine Association of Chemistry Students (PACS).
	   Fil-Estate: A Showcase of Excellence Today and tomorrow at the
SM Mega Trade Hall, witness a showcase of the best of Fil-Estate's
projects and find out why the company takes pride in them. More
importantly, meet the people behind the firm's world-class
projects, and perhaps, you might want to take a closer look at each
one of them.
	   Take for example the group of Fil-Estate Executive Vice
President Cynthia Laurel-Suelto, the firm's topnothcer in terms of
sales for the last six years. Suelto is a CPA turned sales
careerwoman who made it big with Fil-Estate in the area of selling.
Find out how she was able to rise from the ranks and form her own
team, having developed and promoted 21 of her associates through
the years from the ranks to the position of vice presidents and
area sales directors and at the same time contributing billions of
pesos in sales to Fil-Estate yearly.
	   See Suelto and her team at SM Mega Trade Hall, Functions Rooms
AB, and participate in a continuous orientation/accreditation
seminar. An hour or two with the team might convince you to join
Fil-Estate as a sales manager to promote the company's world-class
properties. This seminar will give you an insight as to how people
are made for success which may be applicable to yourself. For seat
reservations, contact Fe Manawis at tel. 637-4681 or Eva Taytayon

	   Ba Savings Introduces Special Dollar Acount for OCWs BA Savings
Bank introduces a special privilege for Overseas Filipino Workers
(OFWs): the Tax-free US Dollar Savings Account and US Dollar
Savings Plus for OFWs.
	   The Tax-Free US Dollar Savings Account for OFWs offers an
interest rate of 2% p.a. for deposits of $200 to $9,999, and 3%
p.a. for deposits of $10,000 and above. There are no withdrawal
restrictions. The minimum balance required to earn interest is only
$200.
	   Meanwhile, the Tax-free US Dollar Savings Plus of OFWs earns
even higher interest rates depending on your deposit amount and the
period you commit this to. The minimum deposit here is $5,000.
Neither the US Dollar Savings Account nor the US Dollar Savings
Plus for OFWs will be charged the usual 7.5% withholding tax on
foreign currency deposits.
	   The Tax-Free US Dollar Savings Account and US Dollar Savings
Plus were introduced to provide OFWs more ways to let their
hard-earned money grow.
	   To open either of these accounts, the OFW-depositor only has to
bring his passport with a current working visa and a copy of his
employment contract to any of our branches. If he is already an
existing US Dollar Savings Account or US Dollar Savings Plus
depositor, all he has to do is bring proof of his employment
overseas and BA Savings Bank will arrange to make his subsequent
interest earnings tax-free. The Tax-free US Dollar Savings Account
and US Dollar Savings Plus for OFWs is available at all BA Savings
Bank branches except Cabanatuan, Butuan and Pagadian.
	   BA Savings Bank is an affiliate of BankAmerica Corp., the fourth
largest bank holding company in the US. Bank of America has 2,000
branches in 11 western states, making it one of the largest retail
banks in the US.
	   Internationally, it operates in 38 countries.

	   A verdict from his colleagues at his own backyard was too much
for outgoing Speaker Jose de Venecia to ignore. Based on the 99 of
the 101 Certificates of Canvass counted by Congress yesterday,
Joseph Estrada was the runaway winner in the presidential race.
Sen. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was also uncontested in the vice
presidential race.
	   ``I accept the verdict of our electorate, and wish only the best
for President-elect Joseph Estrada, who is the clear winner of the
elections, and Vice-President-elect Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,'' De
Venecia said, formally accepting defeat in the presidential
election.
	   He said he was nevertheless honored to have received the second
highest votes, adding he ''fought a good fight and played according
to the rules.''
	   The proclamation for President and Vice President will be held
at 4 pm today at the session hall of the House of Representatives.
The Commission on Elections will also announce the 12 winners in
the senatorial race at the Philippine International Convention
Center also this afternoon. The poll body said it had to postpone
the proclamation of winning senatorial candidates three times due
to the late submission of the Certificates of Canvass by the Board
of Election Inspectors.
	   Estrada was comfortably six million votes ahead of De Venecia,
his closest rival and President Fidel V. Ramos' anointed one.
	   Estrada garnered 10,722,295 votes against De Venecia's
4,268,483.
	   De Venecia also said he felt happy to have supervised the ''the
most efficient and fastest canvassing.'' The completion of the
canvassing would ''pave the way for a peaceful and democratic
transition of power at noon of June 30.'' He added it was a
realization of his ''commitment to a government of national unity
and the emergence of coalitions in the House and the Senate, which
I earlier proposed, and to which President Fidel Ramos,
President-elect Estrada and I agreed in principle in a memorable
meeting on Manila Bay last May 26.''
	   De Venecia was referring to the so-called covenant of national
unity Lakas agreed in principle with Lammp, the political party of
Estrada.
	   ``We will enter into a covenant for the good of our people and
the nation, we need to act as one,'' De Venecia added.
	   Asked if he would help Estrada if the latter asked for an
advice, De Venecia said: ``I am available to give him my advice if
solicited, anytime at any day.''
	   Of the 12 new senators, seven came from Lammp: former senator
Rodolfo Biazon, former Cebu Rep. John Osmena, re-electionists Blas
Ople and Vicente Sotto III, basketball star Robert Jaworski, and
former Malabon-Navotas Rep.
	   Tessie Aquino Oreta.
	   The other 5 winners belong to Lakas party. They are broadcast
journalist Loren Legarda, former Presidential Legal Adviser Rene
Cayetano, former Local Government secretary Robert Barbers,
re-electionist Ramon Revilla and former Justice secretary Teofisto
Guingona.

	   After more than a year of negotiations, state-owned National
Power Corp.
	   (Napocor) yesterday signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA)
forging a long-term power sales deal with the Luisita Industrial
Park Corp. (Lipco) for the supply of 60 megawatts to the firm's
economic zone in Tarlac.
	   Among other provisions, the agreement allows Lipco to directly
connect with Napocor using a 69-kilovolt transmission line.
	   ``Napocor is the only source of electricity which meets the
standards required by the industries expected to locate in our
industrial park,''
	   Lipco President Shintaro Murai said. ``This means high-quality
power supply at reasonable rates and with no fluctuations.''
	   Located 120 kms. north of Manila and 40 kms. from the proposed
Clark International Airport in Pampanga, Lipco occupies a
300-hectare site within Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac, Tarlac.
	   The firm is currently developing the first 100-hectare phase of
the ecozone, which is projected to generate roughly 19,000 jobs
operation.
	   Lipco is eyeing technology-intensive assembly industries,
particularly those involved in manufacturing and semiconductors, as
possible locators in the industrial park.
	   Lipco is a joint venture among Itochu Corp. of Japan, Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp., Hacienda Luisita Inc., and Aguinaldo
Holdings Corp.
	   Itochu owns a 40% stake in the said firm while the 60% is
controlled by the Filipino partners.
	   Murai said the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which
manages the country's export-processing zones and special ecozones,
has already given Lipco the go-signal to source its power
requirements from Napocor.
	   Industry experts said Lipco's decision to pursue its industrial
park project, despite the continued financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia and the economic recession in Japan, indicates the renewed
confidence of Japanese investors in the Philippine economy.
	   PEZA figures showed that from January to October last year,
Japan accounted for more than 50% of total investments in the
country's ecozone.
	   Lipco is the latest industrial estate to enter into an agreement
with Napocor for a possibly bulk power supply contract. Other
interested ecozones include Lima Land Inc., which is developing a
440-ha. industrial estate in Batangas; Acoland Inc., which operates
the Mactan Export Processing Zone II in Cebu; and the Zamboanga
City Special Economic Zone Authority, which operates an industrial
estate in San Ramon town in Zamboanga City. --Angel G. Alegre

Cocaine found in John Tate's blood 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KNOXVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Former WBA heavyweight champion John
Tate was high on cocaine when he slammed his pickup truck into a
utility pole in April and died, the Knox County medical examiner
says.
	   Tate, who fought drug problems and resorted to panhandling after
his boxing career, ``had been using cocaine regularly in the last
24 hours of his life,'' Dr. Sandra Elkins said Monday.
	   But she said that does not change her initial finding that Tate,
43, died from a stroke caused by a tumor at the base of his skull.
	   She said Tate probably was dying as the truck hit the pole April
9. Two passengers had minor injuries.
	   Elkins described the amount of cocaine in Tate's blood as ``just
your average street high.'' However, she said she has seen deaths
from less cocaine.
	   Her autopsy report said the loss of blood flow from the stroke
could have brought on the seizure that caused Tate to lose control
of the truck. The report also said cocaine can trigger seizures.
	   Tate's blood-alcohol level was 0.03 percent, well under the
legal limit of 0.10 percent, Elkins said.
	   Tate, a native of West Memphis, Arkansas, won a bronze medal at
the 1976 Olympics and made his professional debut a year later.
	   He won the heavyweight title in a 1979 decision over Gerrie
Coetzee in Pretoria, South Africa, but lost it less than five
months later when Mike Weaver knocked him out in the final minute
of the 15th round in Knoxville.
	   Tate returned to the ring three months later and was knocked out
by Trevor Berbick in the ninth round in Montreal. A loss to Noel
Quarless in London in 1988 sent Tate's career and his life into a
tailspin.
	   Tate admitted to a cocaine habit during a five-year period in
the 1980s and served time in prison for convictions on petty theft
and assault charges.
	   His career record was 34-3 with 23 knockouts.

	   BANDUNG, West Java: Asep Rukmana, a former employee of
state-owned Nusantara Aircraft Manufacturing Industry (IPTN) here,
regained his job over the weekend, more than two years after his
much-publicized dismissal.
	   Asep's lawsuit against the aircraft manufacturer's unilateral
dismissal was won in the Bandung State Administrative Court and the
Bandung State Administrative High Court.
	   He held a thanksgiving gathering at his home Saturday and told
reporters he was happy because he now could earn a decent
livelihood for his family.
	   The company reemployed him after he won the lawsuit.
	   Asep, 40, who has worked in the company for 16 years, was
dismissed in April 1996 for revealing malfeasance in the company.
	   ``Since the unfair dismissal, I have been unemployed,'' he said.
	   Accompanied by lawyers from the Bandung Legal Aid Institute, he
sued IPTN over the dismissal and won the case in April 1997.
	   He said that he also won the case in January 1998, after IPTN
appealed to the high court.

	   Sir: In light of all the recriminations and mudslinging that
have characterized our recent presidential elections, I would like
to point out that the next president of our country, Joseph
``Erap'' Estrada, is neither as dumb nor as unfit to govern as his
detractors would like us to believe. On the contrary, the former
action star-turned politician has many good, if not exceptional
qualities: giving priority to education for the poor by building
the first Municipal High School in San Juan; initiating
build-operate-transfer schemes in San Juan long before the word
became a catch phrase in government, say; or relocating squatters
to municipal-sponsored housing, complete with job facilities. But
what makes me particularly optimistic about Erap is one physical
trait he shares with many great leaders: he's left-handed.
	   That may not look much, but look at how many of America's most
recent presidents are lefties: Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George
Bush, and now Bill Clinton, are all left-handed. Not only can
Clinton steer the American economy while being busy with Monica
Lewinsky; I'd bet he can do it even without using his hands.
Reagan, of course, is a great influence on Erap.
	   The Great Communicator out-maneuvered the Soviets and ended the
Cold War.
	   He ran a superpower with a few meaningful gestures: the right
touch, the right words, the right actions. He left details to his
more competent aides, a tip President Erap will be pursuing.
	   Not only do lefties become successful presidents, they also tend
to be organizational geniuses, like the great military leaders of
the past: Alexander the Great, who conquered Persia at 24;
Charlemagne, who unified the Franks and Saxons; Julius Caesar, who
expanded Rome from a republic to an empire; Napoleon Bonaparte, who
overran all of continental Europe; and Norman Schwarzkopf, the
architect of Operation Desert Storm. All of these military leaders
were lefties.
	   Great monarchs also tend to be left-handed: Louis XIV was one;
so was Ramses II, Tiberius, Queen Victoria, George II, and current
British Queen Elizabeth II.
	   All over the world, other left-handed leaders rose to prominence
because of their willingness to face the odds, their courage to
stand up, and their single-mindedness in completing their goals.
Cuba's Fidel Castro kicked out a dictator, removed all the Mafia
gangs that controlled its economy, and faced down America in an
ideological confrontation that lasts until today.
	   Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu unflinchingly faces wary
supporters like the US, and detractors like the Palestinians, for
believing that peace in Israel must not come at a great price to
the Israelis.
	   Great men and women rose to face their own destinies, some with
great handicaps, helped perhaps by the magic of their handedness.
Henry Ford went from part-time mechanic to the world's greatest car
manufacturer. Helen Keller, despite being deaf, mute and blind,
communicated a depth of feeling for literature, writing (literally
in the dark) with her left hand. Joan of Arc, who saved the French
monarchy, and was martyred on the stake, was left-handed also.
Benjamin Franklin and Nelson Rockfeller are others American
statesmen who were left-handed.
	   People of great talent, wit, and irreverence are also lefties.
Two of American television's most famous nighttime hosts, David
Letterman and Jay Leno, are both lefties. Hollywood is full of
great actors and actresses who are lefties: from Dan Akroyd to
Carol Brunett, Charlie Chaplin to Robert de Niro; George Burns to
Whoopie Goldberg; Rock Hudson to Tom Cruise; Marilyn Monroe to
Robert Redford; Julia Roberts to Oprah Winfrey. Great comedians
tend to be lefties, from Harpo Marx in the '30s, to Jerry Seinfield
in the '90s. The Israeli performer Uri Geller is left-handed; and
so is the 700 Club preacher and fundamentalist politician Pat
Robertson.
	   Great novelists and imaginative writers tend to be lefties, too.
From Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, to Mark Twain, James
Baldwin, Peter Benchley, and science fiction pioneer HG Wells.
	   The world's greatest artists are all lefties: Leonardo da Vinci,
Michelangelo, Raphael, Albrecht Durer, Paul Klee, and Pablo
Picasso. Many of the music world's greatest talents are also
lefties: the Everly Brothers, Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix, Phil
Collins, Chuck Mangione, Cole Porter, Paul Williams, Kurt Cobain,
Judy Garland, Paul Simon, and Seal are among but a few.
	   Then there are the great southpaw athletes: Pele; Mark Spitz;
Oscar de la Joya; Dorothy Hamill; Marvin Hagler; Jim Connors, John
McEnroe; Monica Seles; and Babe Ruth.
	   Those I have named are just a few of the lefties who have
excelled or become trail blazers in their respective fields. So you
see? Our future President is in very good company. In fact, most of
these lefties were at first dismissed as lightheaded and
``not-serious''. But being right-brained thinkers (hence prone to
visualize mentally rather than use words), lefties grasp the point
faster, and have more creative solutions compared to the
textbook-approach of a right-handed person. Who knows? That's
probably what this nation really needs right now.

	   EVERY year since 1992, Montblanc has honoured a historical
figure, a distinguished personage, by producing a particularly
exquisite pen in a special limited edition.
	   This year the Swiss label pays homage to Alexander The Great -
who founded 70 cities in territories he conquered way before his
demise at 32 -by commemorating the leader with a fine gold-plated
fountain pen. The lotus blossoms embellishing the capital are
characteristic Greek elements as with the classic pillar-style
engravings on the golden pen casing.
	   Delicately engraved on the 18-carat gold nib is a ram's head,
symbolising the oracle of Amon in ancient Egyptian mythology while
the corpus of this precious writing instrument is finished in a
black marbled enamel with gold-coloured veins.
	   These magnificent collectors' items are available at both
Montblanc boutiques in Kuala Lumpur Hilton and City Square.

	   DATUK Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad arrived here yesterday for a
four-day working visit, expressing hope that the regional economic
downturn will have a ``minimal'' effect on Japanese foreign direct
investment in Malaysia.
	   ``It will be affected to a certain extent. There is no running
away from that. But I hope it will be minimal,'' the Prime Minister
told reporters at the Okura Hotel.
	   Dr Mahathir said the big (Japanese) companies ``are still
interested and still coming in'' to make investments in Malaysia
but added that now ``a lot of big investments'' were coming from
the United States in the areas of petrochemicals and chemicals.
	   Dr Mahathir cited two American companies, Eastman and Proctor
and Gamble, as among those making large-scale investments mainly in
the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.
	   ``The trend now is different. It is not just electronics,'' he
said, adding that Malaysia welcomed anybody but at this moment, the
Americans seemed to be the ones ``very keen in making very large
investments'' in downstream value-added activities.
	   Dr Mahathir, who will be addressing two major international
conferences on East Asian economies and the future of Asia, was met
on arrival at Narita International Airport by Malaysian Ambassador
to Japan, Tan Sri H.M. Khatib.
	   Asked on his scheduled private meetings with Japanese
businessmen, Dr Mahathir said: ``Since I am here, I will talk to as
many businessmen as possible.''
	   Today, the Prime Minister will deliver a keynote address at the
symposium on ``Revitalisation of the Japanese economy and the
future of Asia'' by the Institute for International Monetary
Affairs, a non-profit research institute established in 1995.
	   A question-and-answer session is scheduled after his
presentation.
	   The panelists at this session are International Monetary Fund
deputy managing director Stanley Fischer and Japanese Vice-Minister
of Finance for International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara.
	   Symposium participants comprise Ministers and top corporate
leaders.
	   On Thursday, Dr Mahathir will speak on ``Future of Asia in a
Globalised and Deregulated World'' at the ``Future of Asia''
conference organised by Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc (Nikkei).
	   Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is expected to attend
the conference which is aimed at increasing understanding and
fostering closer ties between Japan and other East Asian nations.
	   It will discuss issues covering the trials and tribulations in
Asean, stability of the financial systems in Asia and the
advantages and disadvantages of Asian-styled corporate management.
	   Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Cong Tan will speak on
``Asean-Vietnam, Challenges and Solutions'' while Myanmar Minister
in the office of the Chairman of the State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC) Brigadier-General David Oliver Abel will speak on
``The Past, the Present and the Future''.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is scheduled to attend
the conference. This is the second time Nikkei, which celebrates
its 121st year this year, has invited Dr Mahathir to speak at its
conference.
	   When it hosted the first ``Future of Asia'' conference in 1995,
Nikkei invited Dr Mahathir to address an audience comprising key
figures in government and business from Asia and the US.
	   Nikkei has described the Prime Minister as ``the representative
of the Asian mind''.
	   Both conferences will be held at the Okura Hotel where the Prime
Minister and his delegation are staying.
	   Dr Mahathir is scheduled to depart for Kuala Lumpur on Friday.

	   In what could be the first test case for his populist stance,
President Joseph Estrada was asked yesterday by Bukidnon farmers to
step into the controversial Sumilao land case.
	   The farmers made the appeal following the Supreme Court's
rejection of their petition that they be allowed to till as their
own a portion of the 144-hectare Quisumbing estate under the
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.
	   The farmers, belonging to Sumilao farmers' cooperative Mapalad,
yesterday marched to the Supreme Court, the Department of Agrarian
Reform (DAR) and the House of Representatives to dramatize their
protest.
	   In a statement, Mapalad president Peter Tuminhay urged Estrada
to give farmers the same attention he accorded businessmen,
particularly former Marcos crony Eduardo Cojuangco.
	   Senator-elect Aquilino Pimentel, Mapalad counsel, will file a
motion for reconsideration today at the Supreme Court. Pimentel
wants the High Court to decide on the case en banc, and not merely
through its second division.
	   Justice Antonio M. Martinez, of the SC's second division
nullified late last year President Fidel V. Ramos's formula for a
``win-win'' solution that would have given the farmers 100 hectares
of the contested property. The remaining 44-has., based on Ramos'
formula, would go to the Norberto Quisumbing Sr. Management
Development Corp. (NQSMDC). Bukidnon Gov. Carlos Fortich branded
Ramos' ruling as null and void.
	   Ramos resolution, which ended a 28-day hunger strike by farmers,
was later reversed by then executive secretary Ruben Torres.
	   The farmers are also appealing for help from Batanes Rep. Butch
Abad and Bukidnon Rep. Socorro Acosta.-Benjamin B. Pulta Copyright

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - Universiti Putra Malaysia Vice-Chancellor
Professor Datuk Dr Syed Jalaluddin Syed Salim today appealed to the
student who dropped out of UPM, claiming to be a ragging victim,
and his parents to come forward to assist the university in its
investigations.
	   Syed Jalaluddin also appealed to 20-year-old R. Prasath from
Ipoh, to return for his studies. ``We feel very sorry for him. We
want him to come back.''
	   Syed Jalaluddin said Prasath had to return by June 6 as that was
the deadline for the registration of new students.
	   UPM allows new students to register within two weeks from the
opening date of the university.
	   He assured Prasath's personal safety, saying that the university
authorities could even transfer him to a different college.
	   ``We have our security mechanisms. No harm will come to him.''
	   He said Prasath had informed the college authorities of the
alleged incident without leaving any forwarding address where he
could be reached.
	   Prasath also had not filed a report. This has complicated
matters for the university which had been directed by the Education
Ministry to conduct a thorough investigation.
	   Efforts by UPM to contact Prasath at his home in Ipoh have
proven futile with no response to numerous telephone calls made by
the university thus far.
	   Syed Jalaluddin also said that UPM Deputy Vice-Chancellor
(student affairs department) Professor Dr Rahim Md Sail was in
charge of the investigations.
	   On May 26, it was reported that Prasath had left UPM after a
ragging incident on May 22. Prasath alleged that five youths, whom
he believed to be seniors, had pulled down their pants and
instructed him to perform oral sex at about 3.30am.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into
corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to
specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General
Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here
yesterday.
	   Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically
target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its
business dealings.
	   ``The former president may be summoned, if necessary, to verify
and check evidence in cooperation with other state agencies,''
Deputy Attorney General Ismudjoko added.
	   Ismudjoko said his office would not impose a travel ban on
Soeharto or any of his family members, pointing out that his office
had received guarantees they would not leave Indonesia.
	   Ismudjoko said that while the investigation was very urgent, it
would take some time to complete as the work would involve the
checking of many documents related to a large number of business
deals.
	   ``What is most important is that we should always maintain
national unity,'' Ismudjoko added.
	   ``The investigations are being conducted under the principle of
the presumption of innocence,'' Soedjono asserted.
	   Critics and analysts have alleged that nepotism, corruption and
crony capitalism lie at the root of the economic crisis the nation
has faced for 10 months and have demanded that the businesses of
the Soeharto family, cronies and other senior officials be
investigated.
	   Soeharto, who abruptly resigned from the presidency on May 21
under strong pressure from the House of Representatives, his
cabinet ministers and demonstrating students, has been accused of
amassing tens of billions of dollars from corruption, collusion and
numerous shady business deals.
	   Leading opposition figure Amien Rais called on Soeharto over the
weekend to donate 95 percent of his wealth to the state in return
for complete forgiveness from the people so that the government
should not have to beg for aid from international agencies and
institutions.
	   The secretary-general of the National Commission on Human
Rights, Baharuddin Lopa, said yesterday that Soeharto must be
prosecuted if there is adequate evidence to prove his wrongdoing.
	   Any corruption case should be handled in accordance with the
law, no matter who is involved in the malfeasance, Lopa said.
	   ``If he or she is proven guilty, all of the wealth obtained
through corruption must be confiscated for the state,'' he added.
	   Lopa said the ``solution'' offered by Amien was not educative,
was against the law and could create the feeling of legal
uncertainty.
	   President B.J. Habibie could give Soeharto amnesty, but this
could only be granted after Soeharto's accountability is completed,
according to Lopa.
	   Lopa is also a member of Gempita, the Movement of Concerned
Citizens on State Assets, which was established last week to
collect data on ill-gotten wealth and assets.
	   Rp 200 trillion
	   The Indonesian Business Data Center (PDBI) announced yesterday
it estimated the wealth of former president Soeharto, his family
and its close associates at Rp 200 trillion (US$17.5 billion).
	   Executive director Christianto Wibisono told reporters yesterday
the amount included the assets of Soeharto's foundations under the
Nusamba group, a diversified group managed by Soeharto's closest
crony Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan.
	   ``What I mean by cronies here are those who are clearly close to
him such as Salim (Salim Group's founder and chairman Lim Sioe
Liong) and Bob Hasan,'' Christianto said.
	   PDBI's study values several major businesses, in which
Soeharto's six children and foundations are involved, at Rp 16.9
trillion, with equity totaling Rp 5.32 trillion.
	   These include daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana's toll road
projects worth Rp 1.39 trillion, son Sigit Hardjojudanto's chemical
businesses worth Rp 628.71 billion, son Bambang Trihatmodjo's
diversified Bimantara Group worth Rp 2.72 trillion, and son Hutomo
(Tommy) Mandala Putra's transportation and automotive businesses
worth Rp 3.7 trillion.
	   According to PDBI, the family's major foreign investment
ventures (with foreign partners) total at least US$15.23 billion,
including $3.16 billion in equity.
	   This includes US$1.89 million worth of Hardijanti's highway,
energy, hotel and pulp projects, $6 billion worth of Bimantara's
satellite and chemical projects and $1.16 billion worth of power
projects owned by daughter Siti Hediati Harijadi.
	   Christianto said most of the wealth had been accumulated through
business deals full of collusion, corruption and nepotism such as
monopolies, rent-seeking practices and oligopolies.
	   Companies and foundations controlled by Soeharto's empire had
also been given special privileges to win tenders or to get jobs
from state firms, including oil company Pertamina and energy
company PLN, he said.
	   Christianto said, however, crony business practices and special
privileges had not been the monopoly of the Soeharto family and
cronies.
	   He said many senior officials such as ministers, governors,
regents and mayors also had amassed wealth through corruption,
collusion and nepotism during Soeharto's 32 years in power.

	   MALACCA, Sat. - The Road Transport Department is considering
making it compulsory for vehicles which are due for a change of
ownership to undergo an inspection with Puspakom to deter
fraudulent practices.
	   RTD director-general Datuk Pahamin A. Rajab said the Penang RTD
office was applying the rule to luxury cars.
	   The department will consider expanding it to cover all vehicles,
including second-hand and new ones.
	   Pahamin said a study was needed as it involved additional costs
for Puspakom and vehicle owners.
	   He said if Puspakom agreed to help in implementing this
requirement, then it would have to reduce its fee of RM40 for each
vehicle inspection.
	   ``The fee of RM40 would only apply to overall inspection of the
vehicle.
	   As far as the department is concerned, we are only interested in
making sure that the vehicle or its parts are not stolen,'' he
said, adding that the RTD had blacklisted 100 such cars which had
been identified as stolen.
	   For this reason, Pahamin said a fee of RM15 was feasible as
Puspakom officials only need to inspect the engine and chassis
number to ensure that it corresponds with the vehicle registration
card.
	   ``This is to make sure that the engine and chassis are genuine
and not stolen as new vehicle owners may not know of this.''
	   Pahamin said this after presenting excellence awards to 43 RTD
staff in the southern region at the Malacca RTD headquarters in
Bukit Katil last night.
	   On the Bank Simpanan Nasional car loan fraud case, he said the
department would only process vehicle registration if there was a
car and proper registration papers.
	   He added that this was another reason why the department was
considering having all vehicles inspected by Puspakom.
	   On the loss of vehicle registration cards at its headquarters in
Wangsa Maju, Pahamin said the matter was being investigated.
	   On its proposed academy in Tiang Dua, Jasin, he said a 16.2ha
site had been identified and acquired.
	   ``The department hopes that the academy could be completed by
the year 2000 despite the present economic situation as the
facility is vital to train its officers.''
	   The officers would be trained in all aspects of registration and
licensing, computerisation, enforcement and training to handle
prosecution.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - The Government may have to revise its
strategy to stimulate the economy and come up with additional
measures if the situation worsens, Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today.
	   As the Gross Domestic Product for the first quarter slipped to
minus 1.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent in the previous quarter ended
December, Anwar said: ``We are looking closely at the situation and
may have to revise some of the strategies.''
	   ``If it becomes critical, we will have to come up with some new
measures,'' he said after opening the two-day 3rd Asia Oil  Gas
Conference here.
	   However, he stressed that additional economic measures might not
be necessary yet and ``... there is no need to revise just yet the
projected economic growth of between two and three per cent.''
	   ``We should also analyse the GDP figures for the first quarter
closely and see the trend that is developing. There was a slowdown
in the first two months of this year possibly due to shock and
over-reaction to the currency situation.
	   ``The worst is over, reflected in January and February. The next
month (March) was more positive,'' he said, adding that the trend
had to be studied over the next few months.
	   ``I have always said this before: the real solution is to ensure
there is easing of credit to ensure liquidity and everything else
will follow naturally.''
	   He also said banks would have to abide by prudent commercial
guidelines when lending.
	   Earlier, in his speech, Anwar said: ``The economic, political
and social changes seen throughout the region in the last 12 months
have made it patently clear that business as usual is impossible.
	   ``The people of the region will no longer tolerate the old ways.
They reject corruption, cronyism and nepotism. They demand greater
accountability, transparency and a real say in the decision-making
process.''
	   As such, Anwar said the region's people needed to take a close
and hard look at themselves and identify their strengths and
weaknesses.
	   ``Courage is required, because we may have to inflict further
pain on ourselves before we can emerge as new and vibrant economic
entities.''
	   When asked about the statement made by Prime Minister Datuk Seri
Dr Mahathir Mohamad on interest rates last Saturday, Anwar said Dr
Mahathir was merely expressing the general consensus of the
business community which felt that interest rates were very high at
present.

	   TWELVE Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) artistes wowed
local video fans with a performance in Genting recently. Jointly
organised by Berjaya HVN and TCS and sponsored by Genting Highland
Resort, the TCS All Stars Gala In Genting had an added bonus in the
form of special guest, Hong Kong actor Michael Dao Tai Yu.
	   It was hardly surprising that he stole the show with just his
presence but the 12 TCS artistes held their own with songs, dances
and jokes that had the crowd roaring with delight and approval.
	   Michael's jokes accompanied by his familiar guffaw (complete
with winks for his female fans) earned him a kiss or two and then
he started to sing.
	   Oh, the audience cheered and applaused but forgive me for being
blunt...
	   he should stick to comedy and not give up his day job! His
Singapore counterparts, however, more than made up for the headache
he gave me. Perhaps not all of them sound like Jackie Cheung but
there were some who were really quite good.
	   Needless to say, Fann Wong (already a recording artiste) wowed
everybody with her song Living Alone and Christopher Lee rendered
the title theme of the serial that won him Best Actor last year -
The Price of Peace.
	   The surprise surely had to be Xie Shao Guang. This guy is an
excellent character actor, able to handle both hero or villain
roles. But what I did not expect was that he turned out to be quite
a singer too You Are Not The One I Love. Even more surprising was
his dancing. Ooh-la-la! Hot stuff indeed although the moves proved
to be rather feminine. He must have thought so too, for he couldn't
keep a smirk from his face.
	   Not only could he sing in Mandarin and dance, he proved that he
could also sing in Cantonese - he sang a duet with Cynthia Koh -
and with quite good pronunciation too, I might add.
	   Peter Yu was another whose singing prowess with Didn't Mean To
Hurt You and a duet with Ann Kok was rather `ear-opening'.
	   Other artistes like Cynthia Koh, Phyllis Quek, Ix Shen, Zoe Tay
and Li Nanxing all rendered a song each and joked and chated with
comperes Chew Chor Meng and Pan Ling Ling about their up-coming
serials (a little advertising here?). Ling Ling was cornered into
rendering a part of a song a cappella while Chor Meng performed a
medley.
	   From the cheers and applause afforded Zoe and Nanxing, it was
clear their position at the top in TCS is as stable as ever.
	   Besides songs and dances, there was also an amusing sketch based
on two of TCS' new serials - The New Adventures Of Wisely
(Michael's first with TCS) and Return Of The Condor Heroes.
	   Then there was the audience participation where two couples were
called onto the stage to do their best in matching Ix Shen and
Phyllis Quek on the catwalk. One girl wanted to catwalk with Chor
Meng but this host deftly got wriggled of it.
	   All in, an enjoyable evening and I'm sure the screaming girls
and boys jostling each other for the posters thrown by the artistes
thought so too!

Israeli legislature votes to dismantle shrine at gunman's grave 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: FIXES date of vote from Wednesday to Tuesday
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's legislature voted Tuesday to dismantle
the makeshift shrine that has sprung up at the grave of an Israeli
gunman who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers.
	   In the attack four years ago in the West Bank town of Hebron,
Brooklyn-born Baruch Goldstein opened fire with an automatic rifle
on Muslim worshippers kneeling in prayer in the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, a site sacred to Muslims as well as Jews.
	   The makeshift shrine that has sprung up around Goldstein's
well-tended grave in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, just
outside Hebron, has become a point of pilgrimage for Jewish
extremists.
	   ``What we have today is a memorial and not just a grave,'' said
Ran Cohen, the opposition lawmaker who introduced the bill to take
down the shrine.
	   Objects to be removed include a cabinet containing a Torah, a
case of religious books, and benches and lamps. The grave itself
will not be moved.
	   Cohen said that if the grave continues to be a focus of
pilgrimage, he will introduce a new bill calling for the removal of
the grave itself.

	   ALOR STAR, Sat. - The Prisons Department today urged the courts
to expedite the legal process involving remand prisoners to reduce
expenses incurred by prisons for their upkeep.
	   Citing rising costs as the main reason for the request, Prisons
director-general Datuk Omar Mohd Dan appealed to the courts for
speedier sentencing of 13,274 remand prisoners held in prisons
nationwide.
	   He said prisons spent an average of RM34 per prisoner per day
and an estimated RM902,632 per day for the total of 26,548
prisoners and remand prisoners held to date.
	   The figure marks an increase from the 22,000 prisoners and
remand prisoners held in prisons nationwide until December last
year.
	   Omar said that speedier sentencing would also help reduce
overcrowding in the 37 prisons in the country which are holding
more prisoners than their actual capacity of 20,000.
	   He added that the Prisons Department would also be able to plan
its budget if the process was speeded up.
	   ``For example, if an individual is sentenced to three years in
prison, we can plan the expenditure incurred for the prisoner for
the next three years.
	   ``However, in the case of remand prisoners, budgeting becomes
problematic because we have no idea how long he or she will be
held,'' he said after launching the prisoners' bulletin Citra di
Sebalik Tembok.
	   The bulletin features contributions from prisoners in the Alor
Star prison.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Opposition leader Megawati Soekarnoputri echoed
fellow government critic Amien Rais yesterday in urging the nation
to show compassion and stop battering fallen president Soeharto.
	   Megawati, the ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI), spoke out against repeating ``past mistakes''. She was
referring to the days in the 1960s when her father, founding
president Sukarno, lost power to then Lt. Gen. Soeharto.
	   ``Do we have to heap abuse on the outgoing president every time
there is a presidential succession?'' she asked in an address to
some 2,000 participants in a discussion to commemorate the 53rd
anniversary of the state ideology Pancasila here yesterday.
	   Megawati said it was high time Indonesians stopped the habit of
bludgeoning outgoing leaders.
	   ``Do we have to treat former president Soeharto's family (the
way the nation) treated us, Sukarno's family, in 1965?'' she said.
	   ``Let it be that only I and the rest of Sukarno's family
experienced such treatment,'' she said to warm applause from her
audience.
	   Megawati said denouncing a former state leader was against the
state ideology Pancasila. ``Do we have to replace our state leaders
through such treatment?'' she asked. ``The country's founding
fathers, including first president Sukarno, would have never wanted
us to be like that.''
	   Megawati said she realized the risk and political burden she
would bear because of the compassionate stance that she was now
taking.
	   ``This might make me unpopular among proreform activists,'' she
said, adding that she, however, had told her siblings not to join
those who have been denouncing Soeharto and his family.
	   ``No matter how he behaved, he was still the country's second
president,'' she said. ``I am saddened by the kind of words some
people have been using to denigrate Soeharto and his family.''
	   ``Hang Soeharto,''and ``Drag Soeharto and his family to court''
are among the expressions heard during the three months of
demonstrations that preceded his resignation.
	   On Sunday, Moslem leader Amien Rais called on Indonesians to
``forgive'' Soeharto, to give him peace of mind now that he has
stepped down. Amien's one condition was that Soeharto should donate
to the nation any of his wealth which might have been amassed
illegally.
	   ``If he could do that, then Insya Allah (God willing), maybe the
Indonesian people could find it in their hearts to pardon him,''
said Amien.
	   Also yesterday, Megawati discussed her silence during the
critical days when people became so restless and the push for
reform grew so great that it eventually helped force Soeharto from
power.
	   ``It was better then for me to keep silent than to join the
moves denouncing (Soeharto),'' she said.

	   IPOH, Sat. - Two of the four winners for the Wetland Wonders
Poster Competition organised by Wetlands International, Hongkong
Bank and the New Sunday Times received their prizes here.
	   At a ceremony on Wednesday, Anne Foo Mei Mei and Rachel Mah
received savings accounts worth RM300 and RM100 respectively in
recognition of their efforts.
	   Anne, 16, is the first prize winner for the competition that
centred on the theme on conservation of the environment.
	   The Form Five student from SM Convent, Taiping, said
participating in the competition was her way of expressing her
thoughts on environment conservation while indulging in a hobby.
	   ``I spent a few days researching the wetlands issue to get an
idea for my composition which was done in water colours,'' she
said.
	   She added that more such campaigns should be held to promote
awareness of the environment and encourage conservation efforts.
	   Meanwhile, five-year-old Rachel, who attends kindergarten here,
is one of the three recipients of the special jury award.
	   Her picture of an animal with the words `Protect Us' captured
the attention of the judges.
	   The prizes were presented by Hongkong Bank's Perak manager Au
Hah Chye.
	   Two other special jury award winners, who hail from Kuala
Lumpur, will receive their prizes in the capital next month.

Self-described underdog reaches French Open semis 
</HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ She's a self-described underdog, and perhaps the
most overlooked semifinalist at the French Open.
	   That's fine with second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who says she's
just an ordinary girl playing tennis.
	   With all eyes trained on Tuesday's much-hyped Venus
Williams-Martina Hingis contest, Davenport slipped virtually
unnoticed into the semifinals by defeating the defending champion,
Iva Majoli of Croatia, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3.
	   ``It's really unbelievable. You know I never would imagine I'd
be in the semifinals here,'' she said. ``The focus was really on
that (other) match today, and definitely, that helped me playing in
my match.''
	   Davenport, who turns 22 next Monday, said she goes into her
semifinal contest against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario _ Davenport's
third consecutive Grand Slam semifinal _ as the underdog.
	   ``If I was a betting person or a journalist, I would overlook
myself also. Coming into the French Open, not doing well in Berlin,
I didn't have a lot of confidence,'' she said.
	   But Davenport's victories over Majoli, France's Sandrine Testud,
Russia's Elena Likhovtseta and South African Liezel Horn were no
accident.
	   The 6-ft., 2 1/2 in. Californian arrived in Paris a week before
the tournament began to train hard on the soft, slow clay.
	   ``It's probably the first time I've really spent seven days on
clay, really trying to get used to it, and that really, really
helped me,'' Davenport said.
	   The win also erased the nightmare of last year's quarterfinal
debacle: choking after being up a set and leading 4-0 in the second
to let Majoli back into the match.
	   ``I felt like I really tensed up so much and probably choked,''
she said. ``That's the worst thing that ever happened to me.''
	   Davenport, whose best career wins have come on the fast surfaces
of the U.S. Open and Sydney, said the French Open was never much a
part of her memory bank.
	   She grew up with visions of Chris Evert's last match against
Monica Seles at the U.S. Open, and Gabriella Sabatini losing to
Steffi Graf 8-6 in the third set of a Wimbledon final.
	   Davenport will test her newfound clay-court expertise against
Sanchez Vicario, the two-time French Open champion, who also has
escaped the media glare this year.
	   The two haven't met on clay since 1994 when Sanchez Vicario won.
	   ``I'm a little faster since the last time I played her on
clay,'' Davenport said. ``Hopefully, I'm a bit more consistent, a
little smarter and can wait for the right shot to really go for
it.''
	   Davenport, who's been on the pro tour for six years, said she
feels old to be playing women's tennis at almost 22, and said
there's nothing specatacular about her personality.
	   ``I don't have a tag,'' she said. ``Maybe that's why I'm
overlooked. I'm just an ordinary girl playing tennis and being
successful, pretty quiet and modest. That's a boring story.''

	   An employee was suspected of stealing something valuable from my
company. He denied stealing it but later sent in his resignation.
	   His manager wants to accept his resignation. His reason is that
the matter is solved. So it is useless to take action against the
employee. He also thinks that we cannot take any action because the
employee has resigned.
	   I do not agree with his manager. I feel we can still discipline
him although he has already resigned. Stealing is a serious
offence. This is the reason why I think we should not let him
resign. I am also worried what effect it will have on the rest of
the employees if we let this one escape so easily. What do you
think?CKH, Klang.
	   Answer: Your colleague is being practical by taking the obvious
way out to solve the problem. The employee has resigned. Just
accept it and that's the end of the matter. Very practical, as I
said earlier. Very neat. True, the problem is solved at least,
where this employee is concerned.
	   But what about the effect on the rest of the employees, as you
have rightly asked. In other words, what message is the company
sending to its remaining employees?
	   Clearly, the message is that you can commit an offence,
including one as serious as theft, and get away with it by just
resigning before action is taken against you.
	   Management must be careful of the consequences of its actions.
It has to ask itself what standard of integrity does it want to set
for its employees. Without doubt, it cannot but be the highest
possible.
	   There should be no compromise where integrity is concerned.
Failure to act appropriately against a dishonest employee will only
encourage others to do so.
	   Years ago, a leading entrepreneur in our country was asked which
quality did he value the most in his managers. Without hesitation,
he singled out honesty.
	   When asked why, he replied that you can train a manager to help
him acquire the skills that he needs to perform well in his job but
you cannot teach him to be honest.
	   To be kind we sometimes need to be harsh. We will only encourage
a dishonest employee to continue being dishonest by failing to
discipline him. The saying ``Spare the rod and spoil the child''
applies in the place of work as well.
	   You are right in pointing out that you can still discipline an
employee after he has resigned. In normal circumstances, an
employer cannot refuse to accept his employee's resignation.
However, if he has a good reason not to do so, as in your
colleague's case, he can refuse to allow the employee to resign and
take disciplinary action.
	   There is always a tendency to take the easy way out of a
difficult situation. Some call this expediency. Why go through the
hassle of conducting an inquiry and face the prospect of having to
defend your actions in a court of law eventually?
	   We must remember that it may ultimately cost an employer more
when he fails to do what he needs to, in the first instance.
Dishonesty among employees is likely to increase. In the end, the
employer will face more problems.
	   Less haste, as they say, often gathers more speed. Not only is
this the best way of protecting the company's interests, it will
also send a loud and clear message that the company does not
condone dishonesty and will not hesitate to discipline its errant
employees.
	   If you cannot convince your colleague on the right course of
action to take in this case, let someone in the company who is more
senior than both of you decide but stick to your stand.
	   Question 2: What is the role of the human resources department
in a company?
	   My boss tells me that the department is like the police. Its
responsibility is to ensure a high standard of discipline in the
company.
	   In my company, managers refer everything to my department. The
managers say it is the job of human resources department to
discipline their staff.
	   Their job is to run their departments. The branch managers also
have the same opinion. They think their job is to bring in sales
only.
	   I have tried to get them to see that staff discipline is part of
their responsibilities but to no avail.
	   I am very discouraged because my boss agrees with them. When I
discussed this problem with him, he told me that human resources is
the `policeman' in the company. He said that if managers have to
look after staff discipline, they will have no time to do business.
He also said that the company will not need a human resources
department if discipline is delegated to managers.
	   I am confused. Please explain.
	   Marcy, Seremban.
	   Answer: Take heart. I am sure that you are not the only human
resources manager with this problem.
	   It is a common weakness of managers to leave unpleasant tasks to
someone else to handle. However, when there is limelight to be
grabbed, you can be sure that they will not want to share it with
you.
	   Human resources is a staff function. It exists to support line
managers.
	   Line managers are people in the forefront - if you like, the
battlefield.
	   Can you imagine how ridiculous it is for field commanders during
war to ask staff officers in the headquarters to do the fighting
for them? The field commanders are the right persons to carry out
this job. The soldiers report to them and they know the situation
better than anyone.
	   One of the reasons for the quick and decisive victory of the
Allies during the Gulf War in 1991 was said to be the powers
delegated to the military commanders in the field to make vital
decisions. Previously, these decisions were made in the White House
away from the theatre of war.
	   Another good analogy to use is the family. When a child has done
something wrong, it is his parents, either the father or the
mother, who should discipline him. How effective do you think the
discipline is going to be if someone else e.g. an uncle, is asked
to take the parent's place?
	   We know that this is only common sense. Unfortunately, common
sense often does not appear to be common among people in high
positions.
	   It is unfortunate that your boss - I suppose he is someone very
senior and influential in the company - does not agree with you. It
must be very discouraging to be in your position.
	   Many bosses unfortunately still have very outdated views of the
role of human resources. The managing director of one very large
company once directed his human resources manager to report half an
hour early for work every day so that he can walk around the office
to find out who comes late to work and to admonish those who are
not at their desks on the dot. It is obvious that he had not the
foggiest idea of the correct role of human resources. One could
describe him as a ``corporate dinosaur'' who had never awakened
from his long, deep stupor.
	   One of the reasons why managers avoid handling difficult staff
is because they do not know what to do. So they conveniently push
problems to the human resources manager. If this is your case,
training is the answer.
	   Managers must be trained to work with their staff - to be
effective motivators and leaders. If a manager is successful at
doing this, morale will be high. Consequently, he will have little
or even no disciplinary problem at all.
	   Management, in the final analysis, is about people - not money,
processes or materials. This explains why managers must not only be
technically sound, they must also be carefully prepared and trained
for the ``people'' aspect of their jobs. They become an ``Instant
Manager'' when they are not. Instant managers, in the end, cause
immense problems not only for themselves but for their employers
too.

	   Unisys will conduct its Asia Pacific seminar series ``Will you
be standing tall in Year 2000'' on June 4, 1998 from 8:30 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. at the New World Hotel. The seminars are aimed at helping
local firms deal with the business, legal and financial risks
brought by the multibillion dollar millennium bug or Year 2000
(Y2K) problem.
	   J.P. Morgan initially estimated that the worldwide cost of Y2K
correction is $200 billion and not $600 billion, as predicted by
Gartner Group's.
	   However, it now recognizes that the cost can really go up to
$600 billion.
	   The seminar, which brings in Susan Thomas, director of the
Worldwide Team2000 Program for Unisys, as speaker, has already been
conducted in Australia, Singapore, Hongkong and Malaysia. It is
designed to prepare chief executive officers, managing directors,
chief information officers, general managers, directors of
information technology (IT) divisions, heads of management
information systems, project managers, internal auditors, chief
financial officers, risk/compliance managers, and IT lawyers or
legal counsels to face the problems and risks posted by the
millennium bug.
	   Thomas, who is a principal in Unisys' Information Services
Group, a leading worldwide provider of consulting, systems
integration and outsourching services, has over 16 years of
professional experience in the IT industry.
	   She has been spearheading the company's response to the pressing
needs of clients worldwide, who must prepare their mission-
critical computer applications for the change of the millennium.
	   Working with clients as diverse as the City of Philadelphia,
Dutch PTT, the national telephone company in the Netherlands, and
Anthem Insurance, a national health insurance company, Thomas has
fashioned an industry, addressing the full life cycle of the year
2000 problem - from planning through programming and testing, and
the full spectrum of computers - from mainframes to the desktop.
	   Topics to be discussed by Thomas during the seminar include an
update on the worldwide Y2K activities; management of legal
liabilities as one implements Y2K program; assessment of Y2K
business risks: implementation of a strategy to ensure corporate
survival, in sourcing vs. outsourcing millennium projects; use of
the right mix of centralization and decentralization to ensure
compliance, and leaving ``No Stone Unturned'' when assessing the
Y2K impact.

Villanueva at 892-2011 loc. 8023 or 818-2955 or via e-mail

	   SEPTEMBER 1958: At noon Inspector Niuh came by with Mohd Alias,
one of our Form One boys, saying that he had been picked up along
with some Sulaiman School boys for disturbances at the quarters
near the hospital where they stay.
	   It seems yesterday Alias approached a Sikh woman in a vulgar
way, and she reported it to her husband who, in turn, reported it
to the police.
	   Also, the boys had been seen climbing a tree to watch the women
take their baths.
	   He denied this, too, but there were strong indications that it
might be so. Niuh left Alias with me, and we had a long talk - so
long that I was late to my typing class. I asked him if he would
like to live here, and he said he would but he couldn't afford the
fees.
	   We're going to make room, I informed the boys tonight, and Alias
will be moving in on Saturday.
	   Today's paper had a story about a shipload of several hundred
people being banished to China. It seems that they were shouting
``Long live the Malayan Communist Party'' as they left. I can't
believe that Mr Luke Tan, who was among them, was doing any
shouting of that sort.
	   I felt very bad about his banishment, but the Government is
stern and doesn't make exceptions. I didn't sign the last petition
in his behalf; there was a phrase in it to the effect that he had
no relatives, friends, or land in China. I couldn't sign that -
because I simply didn't know about his China connections.
	   There was a meeting at the district office this afternoon to
plan the collection for the Lady Templer Tuberculosis Fund, and I
found myself in charge of the poster competition for school
children.
	   Heng Thoong is still a very sick boy. We sent his food to him
today, and most of the boys found time to drop by the hospital to
visit him.
	   We had a long staff meeting after school to go through the
report of last year's school inspection and to discuss the new
agreement that all teachers will have to sign next year.
	   Mr Surendranath wanted a clear explanation about each point in
the agreement. He was particularly concerned about the one which
states that a teacher can be dismissed if his work and conduct are
not suitable.
	   When he kept harping on it, I finally told him that if he wanted
to resign but couldn't afford the two months' pay that would have
to be forfeited, all he had to do was misbehave.
	   ``And for you,'' I told him, ``that shouldn't be too
difficult.'' The things I come out with sometimes! At least
everyone enjoyed that one.
	   The matter of cleaning the latrines came up again this morning
when Razak, who was on that duty, reported that they were
absolutely filthy.
	   The buckets are emptied every morning but with some 40 people
using them every day, no wonder they overflow.
	   I went around to the back, discovered the mess, and proceeded to
help Razak myself, with the aid of Tat Pin and Shek Phooi, who
carried water for us. We got them clean, then had a house meeting
during which I announced that they were clean and had better stay
that way.
	   I think everyone got the message.
	   On my way to school, Ismail bin Jamil stopped me to say that
some of his friends might have some trouble with the hostel boys.
(By ``friends'' I think he meant gang).
	   I asked him what was wrong, and he said that during the Merdeka
celebrations one of the hostel boys threw a rock at Jamaluddin, and
it made him angry.
	   During our house meeting tonight, I brought it up, and Razak
said that the fact was that someone had thrown a rock at him -
probably Jamaluddin trying to start a fight. I warned them about
getting involved in gang fights and told them never to carry a
knife or anything that might be considered a weapon.
	   Mohd Alias moved in today, and our number now stands at 37. (To
think that in the beginning we said 24 would be the absolute
limit!) Tonight I treated all the boys to a trip to the Globe to
see The Brave One, a delightful story about a little Mexican boy
and his pet bull. When we got home, Say Kuang and Murad left us in
stitches with their demonstration of a bull fight with Say Kuang as
the bull.
	   The students were asked to write down their teachers' pet
phrases -to be used in the school magazine.
	   They had several quotes from me: ``Nonsense!'', ``What in the
world?'', ``Sometimes I feel like jumping off a high building!''
and of course ``Yakkety yak yak.'' But the funniest, I thought,
were from Mr Wong Yoon Chong: ``My my'' and ``Well well.''
	   Surendranath was on the sick list, so I'm taking over Oliver
Twist in Form Four. The students were quite amazed at the speed
with which we were covering the book; they were used to more of a
snail's pace. I simply didn't feel any need to study Dickens line
by line.
	   Mr V. Rasiah from the education department dropped in this
morning for a look around the school. He had a reputation for
tearing private schools apart, but he was very nice with us. These
inspectors have a knack for coming the day before a holiday, and
when teachers are sick.
	   Only a dozen boys were left for dinner tonight, the others
having gone home for the long weekend to celebrate the prophet's
birthday.
	   Alamshah, Tat Pin, and Kamaruzaman (and I) got into some
mischief tonight when the other boys were out. We rigged up a
`hanged man', using my black Chinese outfit and a deflated football
for a head.
	   We strung him up just inside the bedroom, then removed all the
light bulbs except one. It was a riot listening to the screams of
the boys returning from town when they opened the bedroom door and
walked straight into the hanging figure.
	   They were already in a scary mood after seeing Curse of
Frankenstein at the Globe, and poor Munzir nearly passed out.
	   Almost all the boys went for hockey practise at 7.30 this
morning. I went to school and when I got home at noon, I found that
they had doubled up and got the housework done. I was proud of
them.
	   The Malay boys all went to the Mosque, and they took with them
$25 as the hostel boys' donation for the new Mosque. (They took up
a collection among themselves, but it came to only $9.90, so I
rounded it out to a slightly better figure).
	   They said that the imam announced the donation during the
service, and they were as proud as they could be.
	   A long, interesting letter came from Shamsuddin Salleh. He
brought up the matter of the colour problem and pointed out that
two British people on his ship when he was returning to Malaya had
remarked that Britain had never had and would never have a colour
problem - a matter for debate now since the recent riots.
	   Then he went on to declare: ``I had been asked on several
occasions whether the Americans treated me as an equal when I was
in the United States. Certainly my answer was `Yes'.
	   ``Also they welcomed me everywhere and they took me right into
their family circles. The Americans not only have big skyscrapers,
big two-toned cars, but also big hearts and are generous, loving
and understanding.
	   ``I told them that never had I been treated so nicely - not even
by my own people.''
	   Yeng Kee phoned this morning to say that Foong Chaw's mother had
died.
	   I asked him to buy some cloth and send it for me. We were late
getting to the house, and the procession had already started. We
joined in, walking as far as the hospital.
	   I have always argued that I should not be away from the hostel
at night for fear that something might happen to one of the boys.
Kjell and Margie invited me to Raub for dinner tonight, and I gave
them that excuse, but their ``Just once'' finally won out. I
consented to go when they said they'd send Tek down with the van to
fetch me and bring me home.
	   Tek got here at seven and we started out - with Chow Yin and
Shek Phooi going along for the ride and to see their families in
Raub. When I got to Kjell's, Margie told me that the boys wanted me
to phone the hostel immediately.
	   It really was no surprise, because just before I left, Munzir
asked for Kjell's phone number, and all the way over I felt that
something was wrong.
	   Bakar said that Yit Song had taken sick very suddenly and was
coughing blood. They had sent for an ambulance and were sending him
to the hospital; they had already notified his sister in Raub. I
asked him to phone back as soon as they found out how serious it
was.
	   I tried to settle down to a pleasant evening and the company was
certainly a pleasant lot - Mr and Mrs Lodge from Cheroh Estate, Mr
and Mrs Warrington from the Gold Mine, the Thurleys from Mahmud
School, and Mr and Mrs Paul Raj.
	   Then the phone rang again, and Munzir, talking from the
hospital, said that Yit Song was in quite a serious condition and
had lost over a pint of blood. Beserah, the nurse on duty, came on
the line and said that a transfusion would probably be necessary.
With that, I got ready to come home.
	   Kjell found Tek, we rounded up Chow Yin and Shek Phooi, and we
reached the hospital at about 10.30. Munzir was still there,
talking with Yit Song's sister and brother-in-law, who had just
arrived.
	   Yit Song was resting quietly, so we didn't bother him. Then came
a shocking revelation: the sister ``confessed'' that Yit Song had
been a TB patient before and had had an examination as recently as
the last school holidays.
	   Dr Poopalasingam, who arrived at about 11 said that he'll see
how serious the case is before advising me on what to do about the
other hostel boys. I'm very provoked with the family for not
telling me about his condition when they sent him to live in the
hostel.
	   The other boys were all asleep when we finally got home. I'm not
sure how much sleep I'll get tonight, though.
	   The phone is by my bed, and Choong Foong has instructions to
call immediately if Yit Song should need blood.

	   Banks were actively selling Treasury bills in the secondary
market yesterday due to a supply glut after the Bureau of Treasury
sold securities over the counter for two weeks in a row, traders
said.
	   ``Most banks are offering bills. We saw some rates went up a
bit, about 10 to 15 basis points above the auction rates,'' one
commercial bank trader said.
	   One bank was seen offering three-month bills at 13.90%, from
13.885% posted in Monday's auction, while another bank was selling
six-month bills at 14.70%, against 14.5%.
	   ``There's so much supply in the system already,'' another trader
said. Aside from the weekly auction, the Bureau of Treasury was
offering bills through its tap facility.
	   She said the additional liquidity coming from the reserve cut
this Friday would not translate into lower interest rates.
	   ``If the Bureau of Treasury will continue to open its tap
facility, bankers will not bid too aggressively in the auction. We
can have the tap option,''
	   she added.
	   A Treasury official, however, said the over-the-counter bills,
which carry the lowest accepted rate in the auction, were not sold
out. The agency decides on whether to open the tap facility after
every auction.
	   Yesterday morning, the bureau said it would cut its weekly
offering to P6 billion pesos from P6.5 billion. An official said
the reduction was part of its borrowing program for the month.
	   The 91-day bill offering would be reduced to P2 billion from
P2.5 billion.
	   Other tenors would be kept at P2 billion each.
	   Meanwhile, the overnight call loan rate slipped further to
13.34375% from Wednesday's 13.4375%.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The Malaysian Medical Association today
commended the Health Ministry's move to test Viagra, reputedly the
world's first oral drug for impotence, for possible side-effects.
	   In a Press statement, MMA president Dr Lee Yan San said the
association agreed with the Ministry's move to test Viagra to
ensure it was free from harmful short-term and long-term
side-effects before being approved for public use.
	   ``We feel that if this drug becomes available, it should only be
available by prescription and should never be sold over the counter
to avoid public abuse.''
	   Some of the side-effects of Viagra, reputed to be the first oral
drug to treat erectile dysfunctions include headaches, a flushed
face and `blue vision' purportedly caused by overuse.
	   Dr Lee said in prescribing the drug, doctors will take into
consideration the medical history and health of the patient.
	   ``The doctor must be satisfied that the patient has erectile
dysfunction (impotency) and that Viagra is beneficial. The doctor
must be convinced that pharmacological treatment is appropriate and
will consider other risks to the patient.''
	   He added that doctors would also have to monitor the frequency
with which Viagra is used to ensure there would not be any abuse.

	   THEY were young Malaysian women seeking greener pastures in
Taiwan. Many of them were tricked by their boyfriends into
believing that they could get decent, well-paying jobs.
	   But a day or two after they arrived, their ``boyfriends'' sold
them off to syndicates which forced them into prostitution.
	   To make things worse, they were later arrested during police
raids for not having valid travel documents (their passports had
been taken away by the syndicates).
	   It was during her visit to Taiwan in 1995 to attend an
international migrant workers' conference that Aegile Fernandez,
coordinator of Tenaganita's migrant workers programme, found these
25 women - at a detention centre.
	   Last year, Tenaganita rescued eight south Indian women in Kuala
Lumpur following a tip-off. Aged between 16 and 25, the village
women had married elderly Indian men from Malaysia. They were later
brought to Kuala Lumpur, sold to syndicates and forced into sex
work.
	   These were among 71 trafficked women Tenaganita has helped to
return to their home countries since 1994, when this
non-governmental organisation started handling such cases.
	   The cases also highlight the fact that not only is Malaysia a
sending country, it is also a transit and a receiving country for
such operations.
	   ``Trafficking patterns indicate that traffickers and agents are
cooperating on an international level, and that established
networks have developed. Traffickers, agents and employers in
countries of origin, countries of destination, and transit
countries are working together to recruit, transport and exploit
women seeking to migrate,'' states the Practical Guide to Assisting
Trafficked Women, a handbook prepared by the Global Alliance
Against Traffic in Women (GAATW).
	   Traffickers recognise conditions which allow them to convince
women to migrate. Where economic hardship, political unrest,
militarism or high unemployment are present, traffickers and their
agents are sure to be found.
	   The guidebook was among the materials used in a recent four-day
workshop on trafficking in women and children held in Kuala Lumpur.
The event was organised by Tenaganita and GAATW, a Bangkok-based
international network of 150 organisations and individuals working
against this form of modern slavery.
	   In the process of globalisation, trafficking in women and
children has taken new forms to include not only trafficking for
the purpose of forced prostitution but also for forced labour in
sectors like domestic services and services related to the sex
industry.
	   As the workshop was meant for service providers, the 20
participants - many of them lawyers and social workers - used case
studies to discuss ways to assist trafficked women and children,
while broadening their concept of the issue.
	   Representing the MCA complaints bureau, Datuk Dr Ng Yen Yen said
that the bureau has 63 recorded cases of missing girls and women
since 1994 when it started proper documentation of each case.
However, over the last 10 years, the bureau has handled an
estimated 1,000 cases.
	   ``Of the 63 recorded cases, only 25 returned home. While eight
girls ran away with their boyfriends, 17 ran away with men whom
they had just met.
	   There was this 16-year-old who disappeared, then phoned her
grandmother to say she was all right before the line went dead. Her
grandmother said the girl was on the verge of tears,'' said Dr Ng.
	   Prevention is what the bureau advocates.
	   ``We conduct many seminars on parenting skills targeted at
vulnerable groups in new villages and towns. We hold forums in
schools on growing up and making choices and decisions to create
awareness among students and teachers as well. The media also plays
a big role in raising public awareness of this issue,'' added Dr
Ng, who is the chairperson of the MCA committee on missing
children. The secretary-general of Wanita MCA champions women's
rights and is vice-chairman of the National Council of Women's
Organisations.
	   In discussing legal intervention and human rights, M. Puravalen,
a well- known criminal and human rights lawyer, said that the
hypocritical nature of public morality and patriarchal perceptions
continue to perpetuate the bias that cast trafficked women as
criminals rather than as victims of crime.
	   He pointed out shortcomings in the enforcement of existing
legislation.
	   ``Prosecution is lopsided as it is mainly directed at supply
(sex workers) and not at demand (traffickers and customers). In
illegal gambling and drugs, both supply and demand are attacked,''
said Puravalen.
	   He claimed that the high profit margins and large number of
beneficiaries (including the hotel, transport and tourism sectors,
besides individuals in enforcement agencies) are the main reasons
why sex workers are harassed and charged for soliciting while
customers/procurers are let off lightly.
	   ``The denial of the existence of a sex industry and the lack of
political will in prosecuting traffickers, procurers,
brothel-owners and pimps will further victimise the woman who has
been trafficked. She therefore continues to live in a state of
increased violence and work under slavery- like conditions. She
seems to continue to bear the brunt of a patriarchal society.''
	   Puravalen suggested several ways to combat trafficking in women.
A minimum of five years jail plus whipping should be imposed on the
offender while trafficking, even with the consent of the woman,
should be made an offence. Stricter enforcement of the law where
brothels are closed, movable property confiscated, high fines
imposed and ill-gotten gains forfeited should be implemented.
	   Besides legal reform, there should also be increased public
awareness of the issue, said Tenaganita's director Irene Fernandez.
Services to help trafficked women and children, such as medical
aid, shelter, legal services and counselling, should be improved
and increased.

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, healed from a
potentially season-ending right thigh strain, was included in
Italy's final list of 22 players for the World Cup announced
Tuesday.
	   Del Piero's inclusion meant the automatic exclusion of Parma's
striker Enrico Chiesa, who was a possible substitute for the
23-year-old star of Juventus. Del Piero, who was injured during the
Champions Cup final against Real Madrid, will resume full-time
training with the teammates later this week.
	   Del Piero is considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup.
	   ``Indications of the team doctors (about Del Piero's recovery)
are positive,'' coach Cesare Maldini told Italian television after
a match in Sweden Tuesday night.
	   The list also included Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo, a
last-minute substitute for injured No.1 goalie Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Peruzzi, of league champion Juventus, pulled a muscle in
training at Coverciano Sunday.
	   Inter Milan keeper GianLuca Pagliuca is expected to be on
Italy's starting lineup in France with Parma's Gianluigi Buffon and
Toldo as substitutes.
	   Del Piero, who traveled to Goteborg with the Italian team but
did not even sat on the substitutues bench for the warmup game
against Sweden, was declared fit by team doctors after careful
examinations over the weekend.
	   Italy's official World Cup roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalkeepers: Gianluca Pagliuca (Inter Milan); Gianluigi Buffon
(Parma); Francesco Toldo (Fiorentina).
	   Defenders: Giuseppe Bergomi (Inter Milan); Fabio Cannavaro
(Parma); Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini (AC Milan);
Alessandro Nesta (Lazio); Gianluca Pessotto and Moreno Torricelli
(Juventus).
	   Midfielders: Demetrio Albertini (AC Milan); Dino Baggio (Parma);
Sandro Cois (Fiorentina); Luigi Di Livio (Roma); Roberto Di Matteo
(Chelsea); Angelo Di Livio (Juventus); Francesco Moriero (Inter
Milan).
	   Forwards: Roberto Baggio (Bologna); Filippo Inzaghi and
Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus); Fabrizio Ravanelli (Olympique
Marseille); Christian Vieri (Atletico Madrid).
	   Italy will play its first World Cup match against Chile at
Bordeaux on June 11.

	   ALOR STAR, Sat. - Menteri Besar Tan Sri Sanusi Junid today took
to task those who had criticised the State Government's decision to
close entertainment centres on Thursday nights.
	   He was disappointed with the attitude of the operators who
appeared more interested in profits than helping to curb social
ills.
	   ``It is sad to hear comments about the move encouraging people
to visit Haadyai.
	   ``If we are only interested in stopping people from visiting
Haadyai, then we might as well turn Alor Star into Haadyai,'' he
said when launching an anti-vice campaign.
	   The campaign, to be carried out by Rukun Tetangga, was organised
by the National Unity Department and Menteri Besar's media and
communication office.
	   Sanusi said the move was to discipline operators who had
blatantly disregarded rules prohibiting minors from entering
entertainment centres.
	   ``The State Government is not against entertainment. But it is
not fair to society to have operators who merely think of profits
and not the eradication of social ills,'' he said.

Expert adamant on cause of Lt. Dadang's death, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): A forensic doctor said yesterday she was prepared
to put her job on the line in differing from official police
reports on the death of a Bogor Police officer last month.
	   Police said a student mob stoned Second Lt. Dadang Rusmana, 43,
during a break in a demonstration at Juanda University on May 9 and
that he subsequently died of a head injury.
	   But Yuli Budiningsih Tjatur of the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI)
Bogor Hospital, who conducted an autopsy on Dadang's body on the
day of his death, concluded he died of a heart attack.
	   She said yesterday she did not want the public to make hasty
judgments on the alleged involvement of students.
	   ``I hope the people do not easily judge the students by calling
them evil and that they dared to kill a police officer.''
	   A ruling could only come through a trial, she told reporters at
the Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital here.
	   Yuli, also a lecturer at the School of Medicine of the
University of Indonesia, announced Saturday her conclusion on the
death of Dadang, head of the intelligence unit of Bogor City
Police.
	   Police maintained Dadang died from a head injury sustained after
a rock was thrown at him by students when he tried to intervene to
rescue a military intelligence officer, Capt. Ali, from a student
mobbing. Ali remains hospitalized.
	   Students have insisted they attacked Ali because he was
disrespectful by entering the university's mosque without removing
his shoes outside.
	   Eyewitnesses claim Dadang's body was not at the scene when they
were dispersed by hundreds of police and military officers who
entered the campus.
	   Yuli said her findings were supported by all of her colleagues,
including a forensic expert from the Bogor Regional Police,
Abdullah.
	   The latter also took part in the autopsy of the officer together
with hospital staff and dozens of police officers.
	   ``He told me 'Don't be afraid. I agree with you. Although I work
for the police, I'm also a doctor','' Yuli said.
	   ``I felt relieved.''
	   Autopsy results have been submitted to the Bogor Police.
	   A police officer, she said, had visited her forensic laboratory
recently and questioned an employee why the autopsy finding
differed with the police investigator.
	   ``'I'm the investigator, I have obtained confessions from the
students that they hit the officer, and a reenactment has been
held. This autopsy result has negated our investigation','' she
quoted the officer as saying.
	   When asked for comment yesterday, Bogor Regional Police Chief
Col. Abubakar Nataprawira said he had yet to study the autopsy
report.
	   ``I haven't read it but the confession of the three students and
reenactment revealed that the students hit the police officer with
a wooden bat, stone and stepped on his stomach,'' he told The
Jakarta Post.
	   ``Maybe Dadang had coronary disease and he died of shock after
he was beaten. But to be certain of who was responsible for his
death, let's wait for a court verdict.''
	   Three Juanda University students have been named as suspects in
Dadang's death.
	   National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar expressed
concern yesterday over Yuli's public announcement. He told the Post
that the doctor should have discussed her report with the local
police before making a statement. (ivy/edt)

After Caledonia, French gov't to consider more autonomy for Polynesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The government has agreed to discuss granting
French Polynesia more autonomy, the territory's leader said
Tuesday, after New Caledonia secured an accord that could lead to
independence.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ``told us he completely agreed on
that demand by the territory, for an evolution of autonomy, on an
enlargement of authority in Polynesia,'' the territory's president
Gaston Flosse said.
	   Flosse commented after a one-hour meeting with the Socialist
leader, though there was no immediate comment from the government.
	   Officials close to Flosse said autonomy talks were to begin
immediately, though no date was announced. Flosse said Polynesia's
demands were ``not as urgent as the New Caledinian case.''
	   Flosse met Friday with conservative President Jacques Chirac,
who on May 27 urged greater autonomy for all French overseas
territories in a manner similar to that granted to New Caledonia.
	   Last month, Jospin went to New Caledonia to sign an agreement
setting a referendum in December on a transition period of ``shared
sovereignty,'' followed in 2018 by a referendum on
self-determination.
	   The accord followed a decade of separatist violence in the
Pacific island territory.
	   Floss invited Jospin to Polynesia, and the prime minister
tentatively accepted though officials had yet to announce a date.
The deputy minister for overseas territorial affairs, Jean-Jack
Queyranne, was to visit French Polynesia on June 12.

	   ORGANISATIONS working on the issue of trafficking in women and
providing services and support to affected individuals feel a
strong need for a set of standard minimum rules (SMR).
	   Drafted by the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW)
and the Foundation for Women, in cooperation with the Foundation
Against Trafficking in Women, the SMR aim to protect the human
rights of victims of trafficking, and to address the related forced
labour and slavery-like practices, in particular the right to
control over one's mind, body and life.
	   Said Sherman Manseung Tang, GAATW training coordinator: ``We are
now consulting with human rights and legal experts to fine-tune the
language used in the SMR. Once we have the revised version, we will
promote its use internationally.
	   ``We are also studying relevant laws in various countries to
assess the impact of such legislation on victims of trafficking. In
Cambodia and Thailand, for example, there are specific laws against
trafficking.
	   However, some trafficking laws - in `protecting' women - may
actually restrict women's movement by, for instance, requiring them
to have their husband's endorsement before they can travel
abroad.''
	   The SMR urge governments to take all necessary steps to reform
any law or policy that punishes, criminalises or marginalises
victims of trafficking and to ensure they receive humane treatment
and protection.
	   The rules list down general obligations expected of all
countries, and specific obligations expected of countries of
origin, and countries of transit and destination.
	   Generally, all countries are to guarantee that victims of
trafficking are not persecuted or harassed by those in authority.
They are also to provide adequate, confidential and affordable
medical and psychological care besides giving strictly confidential
HIV testing.
	   Victims should also be given free legal assistance and a
competent translator.
	   To ensure that the victim is able to remain in the country
during trial proceedings, destination and transit countries must
guarantee resident status (for the duration of her or his stay) in
order to take legal action against the offenders and to regain
control over her or his life.
	   Adequate and safe housing, access to state-provided health and
social services, adequate financial support and opportunities for
employment, education and training are also expected of destination
and transit countries.
	   The rules discourage governments from placing victims in
detention centres. Victims should be given access to the
embassy/consulate of their home country and also not be prosecuted
for the use of false travel or other documents and/or visas
pursuant to their predicament.
	   Countries of origin are to protect victims and their families
from reprisals of the perpetrators, including people in positions
of authority.
	   They should not imprison or detain victims upon returning home
for facts pursuant to their predicament, nor for the use of false
travel and other documents.

	   According to psychologist Carl Rogers, ``Experience is, for men,
the highest authority. . . . Neither the Bible nor the prophets,
neither Freud nor research, neither the revelation of God nor man
can take precedence over my direct experience.'' Truth to these men
is subjectively encountered. They contend that nothing really is
true unless you have personally experienced it to be true yourself.
	   What bothers me about making experience the real criteria of
truth is that, first, it makes finite man, not God, the judge of
truth and morals. If, of course, there is no God, it could only
follow that there is no revelation of God's will in the pages of
Scripture, no direction for man, no real concept of right or wrong.
In that case, your personal experience is as good as standard as
any to determine what's right or wrong.
	   But, there is a God in heaven who has revealed His will through
the pages of Scripture. What you think, and what you have
experienced to be true to you, cannot take priority over God's
eternal truth. It's the question of who knows best, the child or
his Father; the created or the Creator.
	   Another thing that bothers me is that experience is an
unreliable barometer of right and wrong. Experience is not a fair
standard of anything, since experiences differ according to the
individual.
	   Truth is not subject to personal interpretations we accept as
true, yet truth is personally and subjectively encountered. Whether
or not I experience some things personally, I can accept them as
true because a higher source of authority or power has revealed
them.
	   Contrary to popular thought, in the pages of Scripture God
invited men to personally experience the truth of His Word. The
psalmist said, ``Oh taste and see that the Lord is good!'' (Ps.
34:8). The truth of God's Word is universal and can be personally
experienced by all men everywhere. It is the Word of God, not the
experience of man, which has been the foundation of the
Judeo-Christian faith.

Iraq finalizes oil prices, signs contracts under U.N. deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday finalized and submitted to
the United Nations the price at which it will sell oil during the
fourth phase of the oil-for-food program.
	   Iraq also has started signing contracts with ``a number of
international'' oil buyers, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
an unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman as saying.
	   It did not saw what the price was or name the buyers.
	   The submission of the oil price formally clears the way for
starting the expanded phase of the oil-for-food program under which
Iraq will be able to sell dlrs 5.2 billion worth oil over the next
six months.
	   The money can be used only to buy food, medicines and other
humanitarian goods.
	   INA quoted the spokesman as saying that the oil ministry also is
actively trying to finalize deals to buy spare parts for its
battered oil industry.
	   In the previous three six-monthly phases of the deal, Iraq was
permitted to sell only dlrs 2 billion worth oil. The third phase
ends Wednesday.
	   The oil-for-food deal was started in December 1996 to help
alleviate the common Iraqis' hardships caused by the U.N. economic
sanctions, which banned the country's export, oil.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until it is certain that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia's economy contracted by 8.51 percent in
the first quarter of 1998, the Central Bureau of Statistics said
yesterday.
	   Sugito Suwito, the agency's chairman, also predicted that gross
domestic product (GDP) would shrink by 10.1 percent this year,
compared to the government's prediction in April that the economy
would contract by 5 percent this year.
	   This is the first time that the government's statistics agency
has published quarterly figures for GDP growth rates. In the past,
the government published the annual GDP figures as part of the
president's state of the nation address in August.
	   The GDP figure is calculated based on 1993 constant prices.
	   The agency said the construction sector was the worst hit by the
recession, contracting by 27.16 percent. The manufacturing sector
followed with 18.58 percent, trade, hotels and restaurants (14.38
percent), financial services (11.1 percent), mining (9.65 percent),
other services (3.7 percent) and transportation and communications
(2.5 percent).
	   Only agriculture and utilities (electricity, gas and clean
water) booked positive growth during the first quarter,
respectively by 28.47 and 7.1 percents.
	   The agency said Indonesia's month-on-month inflation rate rose
05.24 percent in May, bringing the total increase in the consumer
price index to 40.06 percent in the first five months of 1998.
	   Sugito predicted that inflation would reach 80 percent to 85
percent this year, contingent on an absence of extraordinary
happenings such as last month's massive rioting in Jakarta and
other cities. ``But if something like rioting happens again,
inflation could surpass the 100 percent level,'' he warned.
	   Sugito said the main driver of inflation during the first five
months of this year was the prolonged monetary crisis, compounded
by bad farm harvests and increasing fuel prices.
	   Interruptions and breakdowns in the distribution network,
especially because of the unrest in Jakarta and other cities last
month, also contributed to the high inflation rate for May.
	   Food prices rose 3.90 percent, processed food and cigarette
prices 4.00 percent, housing prices increased 4.14 percent,
clothing 4.53 percent, health 2.4 percent and education and
recreation 1.41 percent. Transportation and communication costs
shot up 17.25 percent.
	   On international trade, the bureau said Indonesia booked a
surplus of US$5.09 billion during the first quarter of this year,
with exports reaching $12.29 billion and imports $7.2 billion.
	   Exports declined by 0.9 percent during the first quarter of this
year to $12.29 billion, with non-oil exports rising 9.5 percent to
$10.02 billion and oil and gas exports falling 30.17 percent to
$2.27 billion.
	   Meanwhile, imports reached $7.2 billion, with non-oil imports
totaling $6.2 billion, oil and gas $990 million.

	   Besides Dr. Kaare Rodahl's system, there are other approaches in
using the skipping rope in attaining a high fitness level.
	   But one should warm up before skipping, whether he uses Rodahl's
or some other trainer's system, or uses his own approach in
building the stamina to do 500 skips in five minutes.
	   The warm-up can consist of jumping jacks, squats, forward and
side bends, and trunks twisting and turning, each done about 10
times each or until the onset of fatigue.
	   The warm-up should be followed by a rest of about three to four
minutes.
	   When one feels quite rested, he can start skipping.
	   Rope skipping can tax the respiratory system severely. Beginners
should skip rope slowly and jump only as high as necessary to allow
the ropes to pass under the feet.
	   In their first try, beginners should count as they hop, and stop
when they're slightly winded or when the legs are tightly fatigued.
They can then call it a day.
	   They can begin their program the next day, or two days later by
again warming up with the same calisthenics loads, resting, and
skipping the same way they did during the test day.
	   The program load should consist of two rounds of skipping each
made up of 60% of the load performed on the trial day, and a rest
period between the two rounds.
	   The rounds being shorter, they may skip a bit faster, but must
rest enough to recover their breath between the rounds.
	   Some may develop muscles pains after the first try. They should
relieve the pains with muscle relaxant or with some balm.
	   They can rest for a days or two before starting their program
proper. If they wish, they can do less reps in more rounds-say 40%
of the first day load in three rounds.
	   They should skip rope daily, or at least five days a week. They
will probably improve their endurance by day after the first week
or so.
	   They should thus employ a system of progression, which is an
important element in exercise. As they do more and more skipping,
they should wear well-cushioned rubber shoes.
	   Beginners, especially older people, should progress
conservatively, even slowly by adding two to four hops in each
round every few days, or every week.
	   Young people, and those who've been quite active, can progress
faster by adding 10 skips in each round every few days.
	   They can aim to eventually do as many as four rounds of 150
skips each.
	   When they've reached this goal, they can do a relatively rapid
five rounds of 100 skips each.
	   Then, they can shorten the rest periods between the rounds bit
by bit.
	   Soon, they'd be doing 500 skips straight. Shortly, they'll do
500 skips in five minutes quite handily.
	   The ``500-in-five'' can lead to higher fitness levels, or the
ability to skip 1,000 times in 10 minutes or 1,500 in 15 minutes,
or to do fancy skipping techniques.
	   Of course, skipping rope can be combined with strength work for
a more rounded and truly athletic physical development.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie claimed yesterday it was
the leaders of the House of Representatives (DPR) who proposed the
time frame for the extraordinary session of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) which will set the date for a general
election.
	   Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung said that Habibie, told
leaders of the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) and the
Bishops' Council of Indonesia (KWI) in a meeting that he merely
agreed with the House leaders.
	   ``The president said that the schedule for the session to review
laws which would lead up to the election, is based entirely on the
proposal of the House leaders.
	   ``Therefore the government took the decision constitutionally
and it is in line with the proposals of the House leaders,'' Akbar
said.
	   After meeting with Habibie on Thursday, House speaker Harmoko
announced that an extraordinary session of the Assembly would be
held at the end of this year or early next year.
	   The following day Habibie disclosed that fresh polls would be
held sometime next year.
	   Opposition groups and students denounced the decision, saying
the government was buying time to consolidate its power. Since
Soeharto's resignation on May 21, many have clamored for an
election which would eventually lead to the next president being
chosen democratically.
	   PGI chairman Sularso Sopater joined the chorus for prompt
elections. He urged the president not to lose the momentum of
reform and help restore confidence.
	   ``We commented about the schedule, asking whether it was not too
long,'' Sularso told journalists, adding that many in his
congregation felt the same way.
	   The four-man PGI delegation included Sularso and
secretary-general J.M. Pattiasina, while the five-member KWI
delegation was led by its chairman Bishop Jos Suwatan and
secretary-general Hadiwikarta.
	   Suwatan said the delegation could not fully elaborate on many of
their comments to the president since he dominated much of the
conversation.
	   Former House speaker Wahono yesterday brushed aside Habibie's
legitimacy as president, saying he lacked a mandate from the
Assembly.
	   Mandate
	   ``Habibie is a president without an MPR mandate because the
mandate is still with Soeharto,'' he told reporters after attending
a commemoration of the 53rd anniversary of the state ideology
Pancasila at the Pancasila building on Jl. Pejambon in Central
Jakarta.
	   ``There should be an extraordinary session of the Assembly to
take back the people's mandate,'' he said.
	   After a meeting with Habibie yesterday, the head of the State
Intelligence Coordinating Board (Bakin), Moetoyib, reiterated the
necessity to reform the Assembly as many of its members had
resigned.
	   But the retired three-star general however did not elaborate on
ways to reform the assembly.
	   A slew of Assembly members have resigned their seats in a
sympathetic gesture to the reform movement and its call to
eradicate collusion, corruption and nepotism.
	   During Habibie's meeting with the Christian leaders, he was also
urged to conduct a comprehensive and transparent investigation into
the shooting dead of four Trisakti University students on May 12.
	   Bishop Suwatan also urged the President to include other fatal
incidents which involved security personnel within the
investigators' remit.
	   ``The mastermind of the rioting and looting in the last few
weeks and the kidnapping of activists should also be probed and
dealt with firmly and transparently,'' the bishop said.
	   Then, in an unexpected move, Suwatan forwarded to Habibie a list
of the victims of the riots in Jakarta.
	   The list, prepared in a report by the Volunteers for Humanity
chaired by Father Sandyawan, put the death toll during the riots at
more than twice the 500-odd cited by the government.
	   According to the list, dated May 28, the three days of riots
claimed at least 1,215 lives -- 23 shot dead and 1,192 burnt alive
in fires.
	   ``Thirty-six people are still missing after the rioting,'' said
the report.

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians fleeing the violence in
Kosovo province gave weeping firsthand accounts Tuesday of a major
Serb offensive against separatists that is fast turning into
another all-out civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
	   Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees joining
the growing exodus to neighboring Albania described artillery
bombardments that forced out entire villages, and house-burnings
they said were clearly intended to drive them out.
	   ``It's ethnic cleansing, and it's done the same way as in
Bosnia,'' said Ukshin Maliqi, 35, comparing the situation in Kosovo
with practices in neighboring Bosnia that appalled the world during
that three-year war.
	   ``They shell first so that we abandon our houses, then they burn
them so that we cannot return,'' he said.
	   The accounts provided some of the most detailed information yet
about the scope of the stepped-up campaign launched in late May by
Serb police and army forces, who are trying to crush the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers lately
after years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the
secessionist southern province, where ethnic Albanians represent 90
percent of the population of 2.2 million.
	   There have been no reports like those in Bosnia of massive
civilian roundups or massacres in the Kosovo campaign, which the
Serbs insist targets guerrillas.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted increasing comparisons to the
ethnic war in Bosnia and its atrocities. More than 200 people have
been killed in the past three months.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton told a visiting delegation of ethnic
Albanians in Washington last week that the United States ``shall
not tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo.''
	   But the West repeatedly has failed to get Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and has
yet to devise a strategy for how to resolve the worsening conflict.
	   A NATO official in Brussels, Belgium, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance was ``preoccupied'' with Kosovo and
would debate what to do at a NATO Council meeting Wednesday.
	   Based on information from the refugees and ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo, the latest campaign is concentrated in the
western region of Decani, where the Serbs deployed thousands of
additional paramilitary forces and are pulverizing 10 towns and
villages with artillery.
	   The town of Decani, with a population of about 20,000, was in
ruins with no sign of life, according to the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center. Dead cattle littered the streets, the center
said.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army controls as much as a third of
the province, several refugees said they saw no sign of it in the
sealed-off area under siege by Serb forces.
	   ``When the shelling started we ran to the woods, waiting for it
to stop,'' said Nise Mazrekaj, 27, from the targeted village of
Slup. ``But then the Serbs set the houses on fire, so we couldn't
go back.''
	   Her three young children were crying and hungry after an
overnight mountain journey over goats' paths. Other refugees were
stretched out on the grass asleep, exhausted from their trip.
	   ``There's no way back, no,'' said Mazrekaj's husband, Sulejman,
39, distraught from the shelling a day earlier.
	   The Serb attacks appeared to have intensified over the weekend,
judging by the stream of refugees that began Sunday morning to
Albania. U.N. officials said 1,600 refugees had registered, but
local Albanian officials said about 5,000 refugees had arrived,
many refusing to register.
	   ``The people keep coming,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for
the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva.
	   Communications with western Kosovo remained cut off.
	   A monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe who spoke on condition of anonymity said military action in
the area around the border appeared to have declined.
	   Serb authorities said militants fighting for independence had
attacked police along a road in western Kosovo, killing one
officer.
	   The authorities also said they had broadcast radio appeals for
residents of Decani and several villages to return. The residents
were told their safety would be guaranteed as long as they didn't
participate in ``terrorist activities.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders publicly acknowledged the existence of
the Kosovo Liberation Army for the first time Tuesday, noting that
the ``massive Serb aggression is meeting heavy resistance'' from
the people and the KLA.
	   Adem Demaqi, a prominent ethnic Albanian leader known as
Kosovo's ``Mandela'' for the years he spent in Serbian prisons,
appealed to the KLA to refrain from targeting innocent Serb
civilians in retaliation for police brutality.
	   Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in jail under South Africa's
previous white-minority government. He was elected president in
1994.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Transportation and Communications Giri
Suseno Hadihardjono said yesterday PT Sempati Air, one of the
country's six scheduled airlines, would stop operations after being
crippled for months by the monetary crisis.
	   ``It is impossible for Sempati to continue operations in the
current difficult situation,'' Giri told reporters after a
ministerial meeting on economy, finance and industry at the
National Development Planning Board headquarters here.
	   ``The government has extended assistance to the company, but its
problem is so complicated that there is no other choice for it but
to stop operation.''
	   He did not say when termination of operations would take effect,
but company employees said they would likely end this Saturday.
	   ``The management has told us that employees for flight service
will be laid off this Saturday, but those handling administration
would remain on to collect proceeds from agents,'' a manager said.
	   Sempati spokeswoman Rima Novianti refused to confirm Giri's
statement yesterday, but said the company's shareholders would meet
Wednesday to discuss whether it should halt operations amid the
economic crisis.
	   ``It's difficult to gain a profit today with 80 percent of our
cost in dollars, while earnings are in rupiah,'' Rima told The
Jakarta Post.
	   Indonesia has been worst hit by the region's monetary crisis,
which started in Thailand in July last year. The rupiah sank to its
lowest level of Rp 17,000 per U.S. dollar in January, compared with
a precrisis level of Rp 2,450 last July.
	   The rupiah was 11,500 against the greenback yesterday.
	   Rima denied speculation Sempati was folding because of the
downfall of former president Soeharto. Majority shareholders
include Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra and close Soeharto associate
Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan.
	   Sempati, founded in 1989, is owned by the Malaysian-Indonesian
joint venture Asian Aviation Inc. (40 percent), the Indonesian
Army's PT Tri Usaha Bhakti (Truba) (25 percent), Bob Hasan (20
percent) and the Humpuss Group, controlled by Tommy (15 percent).
	   Rima said Sempati operated a fleet of 25 leased aircraft and
employed 3,500 workers at its peak in 1996, a time when it was
labeled the country's largest private air carrier.
	   Currently, it uses five Boeing 737 aircraft and has about 700
employees.
	   Although Giri said the government would ask other airlines to
take on the routes serviced by Sempati, he noted this would be
difficult as most carriers were beset by similar economic problems
and were reducing their flight rosters.
	   ``Anyway, the government will do its utmost to make sure all
provincial towns are served by airflights,'' Giri said.
	   The five other scheduled air carriers are state owned Garuda
Airlines, Garuda's subsidiary Merpati Nusantara, Bouraq Airlines,
Mandala Airlines and Dirgantara Air Service.
	   Except for Dirgantara, which only operates its own aircraft, the
carriers lease many of their aircraft.

	   The tariff and related matters committee has decided to cut
import duties on coffee beans and corn substitutes.
	   Trade Undersecretary Melito Salazar yesterday told reporters the
11-man tariff committee decided to bring down the tariff on coffee
beans from 45% to 10% starting next year and corn substitutes like
rye, barley and oats from 35% to 20% in 1998, 15% in 1999 and 10%
by 2000.
	   The cuts were in line with the Philippines' commitments as a
member of the World Trade Organization, said Salazar. These would
have a negligible impact on farmers, he said.
	   Salazar said government met with coffee producers and users
before it cut the tariff on coffee. These groups confirmed there
was a shortage in domestic supply, he said.
	   In a letter to the Board of Investments, the Coffee Association
of the Philippines, International Coffee Organization-Certifying
Agency, Coffee Industry of the Philippines and the Specialty Coffee
Association of the Philippines asked government to raise the volume
of coffee that the country could import with preferential tariff
from 1,000 metric tons to 5,000 metric tons.
	   These groups said domestic coffee production was hit by the El
Nino dry spell.
	   Local corn makers opposed moves to lower the tariff on corn
substitutes, saying pork and poultry producers would be encouraged
to use rye, barley and oats as feeds instead of corn.
	   The tariff committee has yet to decide on the duties on other
sensitive agricultural commodities as sugar, corn, onions and
cabbage.

<TEXT>
	   The national government reported to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) that tax remittances from the country's top 10 firms
during the first three months suffered a steep drop of 33.5% to
P2.113 billion from P2.598 billion recorded during the same period
last year.
	   Confidential documents revealed that actual collection fell
43.3% short of the P3.726-billion target prescribed by the IMF
after earlier consultations with the Department of Finance (DOF).
	   While making allowance for the effects of the marked slowdown in
the country's economy, a ranking Finance official in an interview
yesterday noted tax evasion was suspected to be the main reason for
the slump.
	   ``It was one possible cause, although the BIR (Bureau of
Internal Revenue) now focuses on areas where they can get
additional collections. Tax evasion is always a problem...the
election factor was ruled out,'' he said.
	   He further said government would be concluding its investigation
of the drastic decrease by the second quarter. ``It cannot be done
in 10 days. The audit requires three months.''
	   However, the official immediately noted the downtrend was also
brought about by the lingering effects of the regionwide economic
crunch that ensued in mid-1997.
	   The crisis has led to an average earnings reduction of above 20%
for the first quarter for firms listed at the Philippine Stock
Exchange.
	   Latest projections have put Gross National Product (GNP) growth
somewhere between 1.90% to 3% while allowing for Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth of between 1.24% and 2.40%. Both figures
represent a 50% decline from last year.
	   ``The decrease in income taxes from these companies also
signified this. The taxes for the period were actually taken from
the last quarter of last year,'' the official who requested
anonymity said.
	   The documents added that the closure of several corporations in
1997, such as Marcopper Mining Corp. and Marinduque Quick Lime
Corp., ``adversely affected collection of corporate tax.''
	   The official, however, pointed out that collections from
corporations were expected to pick up by June.
	   IMF Right About Tax Administration -- BREAKER The report showed
government oil firm Petron Corp. remitted P578.88 million; premiere
telecommunications firm Philippine Long Distance Co. paid P548.12
million; beverage giant Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc. paid P264.68
billion; leading power supplier Manila Electric Co. remitted
P248.30 million; food giant San Miguel Corp.'s payment amounted to
P185.02 million; FR Cement Corp. remitted P150.1 million; appliance
maker Solid Corp.'s taxes amounted to P147.79 million; duties
collected from tire maker Goodyear Philippines' amounted to P96.43
million; oil company Pilipinas Shell remitted P86.14 million; and
United Coconut Planters Bank forwarded P67.80 million.
	   Government failed to divulge these firms' year-ago individual
tax payments which totalled P3.179 billion. Finance authorities had
committed to the IMF an amount of P75.588 billion in taxes, higher
than last year's actual level of P64.797 billion.
	   Sources at the DOF confirmed financial managers conceded the
stringent proposals of the IMF for enhancing tax administration
were necessary after fiscal managers actually failed to produce the
goods in accordance with targets earlier set with the IMF.
	   ``They (IMF suggestions) are all right and we agreed to
initially monitor the first 200 corporations and subsequently, the
top 2,000. But I am not sure if we can manage with respect to the
top 5,000 firms,'' a DOF official said.
	   The IMF wanted government to further expand its monitoring of
corporations' finances to include the 5,000th largest taxpayer
nationwide.
	   The report further stated that: Collections from the final tax
on bank deposits were 115.57% above target. This was attributed to
the increase in the volume of deposits by 8.81% and the increase in
interest rates; Capital gains tax collection recorded a 34.96%
shortfall against target. T he decrease was a result of lower
collection from the sale of real estate properties, as manifested
by the number of tax returns filed --down by 7.98% in the first
quarter; Excise taxes from alcohol, tobacco, petroleum, and
miscellaneous products registered a 15.55% rise and overshot goals
by 10.09%; Taxes from insurance premiums also dropped but no
specification was given; Withholding tax collection from paid wages
rose by 15.99%, overperforming programmed levels by 12.99%.
	   ``Miscellaneous taxes,'' meanwhile, showed a 5.33% drop.
	   NG Sticks to 25% Spending Cut -- BREAKER In the face of the less
than favorable developments on the tax collection front, government
sees itself strenghtened in its resolve to stick to the 25%
mandatory budget cut for government agencies.
	   The measure had caused the IMF to suggest that government lower
the requirement in order to provide continued sufficient funding
for social projects.
	   It urged authorities to strictly monitor the remaining 75% since
part of it could be diverted to non-essential projects.
	   Finance Undersecretary Milwida Guevara yesterday said any move
to modify the cut was unlikely because it was important to enhance
revenue collection.
	   ``We are looking at our figures on revenues again ... we still
have revenue problems,'' Guevara said.
	   However, she admitted the cut could constrict financing for
social services as it was an ``across-the-board'' directive.
	   The IMF's call was seconded by industry analysts who said the
public may not be given proper basic services since the El Nino
phenomenon has devastated food production in Mindanao.
	   Philippine Institute for Development Studies Director Pociano
Intal was one such economist who urged government to scale down the
requisite to no more than 15%.
	   Fighting for A Surplus -- BREAKER An informed official,
meanwhile, announced the Bretton Woods institution had softened its
criticism of an expected large cash budget deficit after the DOF
satisfactorily justified shortfalls.
	   The IMF earlier warned a fiscal gap of P50 billion would be
incurred by year-end unless government religiously followed reforms
prescribed under the Memornadum of Economic and Financial Program
(MEFP).
	   ``They (IMF) may be willing to accept a deficit, but as for us,
we will not give up the P5-billion surplus target. As DOF Secretary
(Salvador) Enriquez said, it will be our fighting target,'' the
official underscored.
	   ``As a matter of fact, the target was agreed by both of us - the
government and the IMF,'' he added.
	   MEFP paved the way to the two-year precautionary arrangement the
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the DOF had forged with the IMF
after the three-year extended fund facility program expired last
March.
	   If government complies with the MEFP performance criteria it can
avail of emergency funds worth $1.4 billion.

	   JAKARTA (JP): West Jakarta District Court sentenced an executive
of privately run Bank Central Asia (BCA) yesterday to eight months
in jail for swindling Rp 396 million from customers.
	   Presiding judge Parwoto said Budiyanto Teguh, 33, the customer
service head of the BCA branch on Jl. Gajah Mada, was proven guilty
of misappropriating the funds from the accounts of 34 customers
between February 1996 and October 1997.
	   ``The defendant has damaged people's trust in the banking
industry, especially the customers' trust in BCA,'' Parwoto said.
	   But he said the panel of judges also considered the polite
behavior of the defendant during the trial, his acknowledgement of
his crime and the fact he had ceded his home to the bank as
compensation in deciding on sentencing.
	   In committing the crime, Parwoto said the father of three
learned how to operate computers at the bank from his subordinates,
identified as Kristin, Dwi and Hari.
	   The defendant transferred funds from customers to his account
after acquiring the computer passwords of the subordinates, he
said. ``He then withdrew the (transferred) money from the bank's
automatic teller machines.''
	   Budiyanto transferred funds when his subordinates were at lunch
or reporting the bank's daily transactions at Bank Indonesia, he
said.
	   The scam remained undetected for months because Budiyanto
identified rarely used accounts.
	   But it unraveled when several customers reported their money had
been withdrawn without their authorization.
	   Parwoto said the defendant was proved guilty of violating
Article 374 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum
punishment of five years in jail.
	   Both prosecutor Baskara and the defendant are considering
whether to appeal.
	   Baskara earlier asked the court to sentence Budiyanto to one
year in jail.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian markets bounced back Tuesday as President
Boris Yeltsin convened an extraordinary meeting of the country's
most powerful business tycoons to map out a strategy of economic
recovery.
	   Shaking his finger at 10 of the ``oligarchs'' who control the
country's banking conglomerates, Yeltsin urged them to do more to
keep investors from pulling their money out of the Russian economy.
	   ``Our meetings are rare,'' Yeltsin said. ``Only when it's too
much to bear, when the government is in trouble, when the economy
begins to crack, when foreign investors begin to flee, and when our
own investors won't keep their money here.''
	   After meeting with Yeltsin, the 10 leading bankers and
industrialists promised to submit proposals for restoring
confidence in the economy, and Yeltsin said he would present a
crisis plan by the end of June.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Newly installed City Police Chief Maj. Gen.
Noegroho Djajoesman promised yesterday to give a motorbike to a
reporter whose motorcycle was stolen at the city police
headquarters on Saturday.
	   Speaking after a city police briefing at Senayan Stadium,
Noegroho was surprised to hear about the report and ordered the
military police to tighten security inside the headquarters area.
	   ``So your motorbike is missing? Don't worry. I'll replace it.
When? Now or tomorrow?'' the two-star general asked Bonyfasius
Sadono of the Suara Karya daily.
	   Sadono gave a big smile and say: ``Really, sir?'' and Noegroho
replied, shaking his hand: ``Of course. I have to be responsible
for this matter, especially because it was lost within the City
Police area, ha ha.''
	   Sadono's Honda GL100 went missing Saturday after he had parked
it near the press room at the city police headquarters to attend
the city police chief's welcoming party.
	   He realized that the motorbike was missing at about 12:30 a.m,
an hour and a half after the party finished.
	   ``At first, I thought that somebody was playing a cruel joke on
me because the helmet of another reporter, Usman, was also missing.
But a few minutes later, the helmet was put back on his
motorcycle,'' Sadono said.
	   He considered the incident outrageous because the press room was
being used as a hangout by mobile brigade officers.
	   ``Well... the place should have been safe, shouldn't it? But the
facts speak for themselves,'' he said, adding that he saved for two
years to buy the motorbike in 1994. Its replacement value is about
Rp 8 million (US$700).
	   Sadono, who reported the incident to the police, felt relieved
and happy at the police chief's promise.
	   ``Maybe your motorbike went missing because it has a Central
Java (Semarang) plate, H 5878 WS,'' some of the reporters teased,
pointing to the new chief's posting stint as chief of the Central
Java police.
	   ``Well... the most important thing is that you will have a new
motorbike,'' Noegroho said with a smile on his face.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab nations vowed Tuesday to work toward
preventing Israel from getting economic benefits from Europe as
long as it follows a hard-line stand on the Middle East peace
process.
	   ``The reason for the crisis in the peace process is the current
Israeli government,'' Arab League Secretary General Esmet Abdel
Meguid said.
	   He was speaking at a joint news conference by foreign ministers
of Arab nations who are preparing for the June 3-4
European-Mediterranean conference of foreign ministers in Palermo,
Italy.
	   Israel is participating along with Cyprus, the Palestinian
territory and eight Arab countries from the Mediterranean basin.
The Libyan foreign minister will not attend. Europe will be
represented by 15 members of the European Union.
	   A spokesman at Israel's foreign ministry said Tuesday evening
that he knew of no official comment.
	   But Israeli Army Radio reported that Yoav Biran, a deputy
director of the foreign ministry, met with high-ranking officials
in the British foreign ministry Tuesday to prevent a denunciation
by the EU against Israel.
	   The report did not specify if the meeting was in response to the
threats by Arab nations.
	   The Arabs fear that Israel will try to persuade Europe to ignore
the faltering Middle East peace process while boosting business
links.
	   But ministers of the Arab participants, who met on Monday and
Tuesday in Beirut to chart a common strategy, have decided to stand
firm against Israel, Lebanon's Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said.
	   The Arab ministers agreed that it was ``impossible to separate
politics from the economy,'' he said.
	   The European Union gives dlrs 2.3 billion in annual aid to the
region, including Israel.
	   Since Israel's hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came
to power two years ago, Arab states have accused him of reneging on
the land-for-peace formula adopted during the U.S.-sponsored 1991
Middle East peace conference in Madrid, Spain.

	   CISARUA, West Java (JP): The prolonged economic crisis and
political uncertainty has forced many businesspeople to temporarily
close their factories, shops and offices.
	   Some have asked their employees to be understanding and have
promised to rehire them as soon as the situation allows.
	   But what can zoo owners do when the price of animal feed and
medicine rises sharply?
	   The popular Safari Wildlife Park in Cisarua, West Java, boasts
2,500 animals in its collection made up of 225 species from five
continents.
	   Animals in the park, especially the carnivorous species, now
have to go without food for up to three days a week.
	   A sharp fall in the value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar
which began last July has caused the price of imported and locally
produced animal feed to rise to unaffordable levels.
	   The animals need 16 tons of imported meat, chickens, pigs, and
tons of fruit, vegetables and fodder every month.
	   The park's collection of 70 tigers, the largest in the world and
including 27 endangered Sumatran tigers, are now left unfed for two
to three days each week. The imported meat which formerly made up
their diet has become unaffordable to the park's owners and has
been replaced with chickens.
	   In rupiah terms, the price of imported meat has soared from Rp
3,500 per kilogram to Rp 11,000 per kg.
	   The price of locally produced feed has also risen sharply and
the park's management are at a loss as to what to do.
	   Chicken has risen from Rp 2,000 per kilogram to Rp 7,000 per kg
because local farmers have temporarily stopped breeding them,
ironically because of the soaring cost of chicken feed.
	   To stave of bankruptcy for as long as possible, the park's
owners, Tony Sumampauw and his relatives Frans Manansang and Jansen
Manansang, have tried to find cheaper ways to feed the animals in
their collection.
	   ``We have no choice,'' Tony told The Jakarta Post, over the
weekend.
	   However, the cost cutting measures have not met with success and
steps such as feeding the tigers unplucked chickens in the hope
that the feathers would satisfy their hunger for a longer period of
time appear to have done more harm than good. Animals have shown
loss of appetite, fallen ill, and some pregnancies have aborted,
Tony said.
	   Consequently the management had to spend extra money on
medicines, he added.
	   ``We then decided to starve them for a certain number of days
each week, which is a closer replication of the conditions which
they would face in the wild,'' Tony explained.
	   Daily running costs, made up mostly of food expenses, have
jumped from Rp 7 million to Rp 18 million since the rupiah plunged
in value, while ticket sales now average Rp 4 million.
	   ``We are now running the business at a loss,'' he said.
	   A drastic drop in the numbers of visitors to the park has
compounded the situation.
	   Tony said the 400-hectare park had received almost no foreign
visitors since February. Before the monetary crisis and consequent
social turmoil, foreigners made up 12.5 percent of the park's 1.8
million annual visitors.
	   ``Local group visitors, usually 25 percent of our total, have
also been almost non-existent since January,'' he added.
	   Furthermore, he said, related park businesses, including a
recreational playground, the 400-room Safari Garden hotel, 23
caravan units and 15 bungalows, have been running at a loss,
despite the fact that prices have been held at pre-crisis levels.
The recently introduced night safari tour has already been closed
down.
	   Similar problems are faced by a second Safari park owned by the
brothers near Jatiarjo village in Prigen, East Java, where 500
animals from 100 species are held on a 400-hectare site.
	   The animals there need 200 kg of meat, 1 ton of fruit and
vegetables, and 6 tons of grass every day.
	   ``If things continue as they are we might only survive for a
further six or seven months,'' Tony said.
	   ``We have no idea what will happen to our animals if the
situation worsens,'' he added.
	   Tony therefore urged the government to strive to build a
business climate that would rebuild confidence and attract visitors
back to his park.
	   ``What we are hoping for is economic and political stability,''
he said.
	   Fortunately the animals' plight has been drawn to the attention
of a number of animal lovers, including former minister Joop Ave
and students from Azabu University in Japan, who have donated funds
to the park's management.
	   ``I hope that international animal welfare groups and related
organizations can temporarily help us fund our operations,'' Tony
said.
	   Despite the gloom, the park's management were pleasantly
surprised after 3,462 visitors and 647 cars entered the park on
Sunday.
	   ``This is the first crowded Sunday in a long time,'' park
spokesman Julius said.
	   Most of the visitors were junior high school students
celebrating their graduation, he added.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Roadside Food Stall Owners Cooperative vowed
yesterday to continue pressuring the government to compensate them
for losses suffered during the free-meal programs organized in
March by former minister of social services Siti Hardijanti
Rukmana.Cooperative head Sastoro said at least 13 fellow traders
sought help from related bodies, including the Ministry of
Cooperatives and Small Enterprises, in April to clear their unpaid
meals worth Rp 7 million (US$600).However, they received no
appropriate response, he said.''But we'll continue to ask for
compensation from the government and I believe the (new) government
will meet our request or else we'll pursue legal avenues,'' Sastoro
told The Jakarta Post.The charity event was designed to temporarily
provide meals for Jakartans, especially lower-class workers who had
lost their jobs as a result of the monetary crisis.In highly
publicized ceremonies, the then minister Hardijanti, former
president Soeharto's eldest daughter popularly known as Tutut,
launched her scheme and invited selected unemployed residents to
receive the free meals.The program was launched following her
father's pledge to donate his and his ministers' salaries to the
poverty alleviation program.The meals were paid for with the Rp 40
million she distributed to the city's five mayoralties for the
poverty alleviation campaign.Tutut herself had collected a total of
some Rp 3 billion for the nationwide scheme.During the program some
15,000 boxes worth Rp 1,500 each were provided by about 400 food
stalls in all five mayoralties.The meals, consisted of rice, half
an egg, vegetables and a piece of tempeh, were given to the needy
in return for the coupons the latter collected at their respective
sub district officials.Each stallholder was supposed to give the
meals to 50-odd people who had been given coupons, Sastoro said.
The 13 complainants had each received Rp 525,000 in advance
payments.''But more people, mostly without coupons, turned up and
demanded for the meals, claiming that they also deserved the meals
because they were unemployed and poor,'' he said.''The stallholders
could not shun them because the organizers did nothing to stop
them. So they still suffered losses.''He gave no reason why the
cooperative only exposed the problem after Tutut was dismissed from
her position last month a few days after Soeharto resigned the
presidency.The cooperative has opened a hotline center to help
other stallholders who might have experienced the same problem
during Tutut's campaign.''There might be other owners who did not
report their losses. Not to mention those who are not members to
the cooperative. I heard some complained their fees were not paid
by the program organizers,'' Sastoro said.He also accused the free
meal program of being ineffective and looking like a ``Robin Hood''
campaign.''It was incorrect to let unemployed or poor people get
free food from other poor people who worked night and day to
support themselves,'' he said.He said many food stall owners had
also lost their livelihoods because of the economic crisis.''About
25 percent of our 4,500 members in Jakarta have closed their
businesses. Some of them went back to their villages, others took
work with other owners,'' said Sastoro.He lambasted Tutut for using
the program only to gain support and sympathy from the poor.''This
was never a rescue program. It was only a hura-hura (enjoyment)
event during which she received lots of money donated by
businesspeople for this program,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Nineteen military personnel suspected of
involvement in the fatal shooting of four Trisakti University
students will be brought before a military tribunal on June 6, an
official said yesterday.
	   Head of the Jakarta Military Police, Col. Hendardji, told the
media that defendants were being detained at Jakarta Military
Police Headquarters in Guntur, South Jakarta, for further
investigation.
	   ``They are all being processed according to existing rules,'' he
said, asking reporters stop bothering him.
	   ``I'm tired... don't chase after me about this, please,'' he
said, refusing to identify the names and units of the suspects.
	   A reliable source told The Jakarta Post yesterday that all the
bullets used in the killings had a diameter of five millimeters.
	   Armed Forces (ABRI) spokesman Brig. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan
said recently that the 19 included nine low-and middle-ranking
officers, six noncommissioned officers and four privates. Copyright

	   TANGERANG (JP): West Java High Court chief Padmadisastra has
installed Soebardi as the new Tangerang District Court chief,
replacing Soedardji who is being promoted to be a judge at the
Tanjung Karang High Court in Lampung.
	   Padmadisastra said at the installation ceremony Saturday that
court officers had to positively respond to reform in all sectors
as is now being demanded by the public.
	   Tangerang Regent Agus Djunara also urged law officers to improve
transparency, honesty and fairness related to the increasing
demands for total reform.
	   ``There is no other choice. We should face the people's demands
with transparency and honesty,'' he said.
	   Soebardi, a former judge at the Central Jakarta District Court,
said that he would soon investigate alleged illegal practices in
his court.
	   ``We will study the information about the illegal practices,''
he said.
	   The illegal practices allegedly conducted by the court include,
among other things, issuance of birth and heritage certificates at
a cost of between Rp 300,000 (US$26) and Rp 400,000 each. Copyright

	   BOGOR (JP): Bogor regent Eddie Yoso Martadipura has said that
about 70 percent of roads covering a total length of 1,860
kilometers in the city are in disrepair.
	   ``Only between 120 and 140 kilometers of the roads can routinely
be repaired. The rest are left untouched,'' Eddie said.
	   He explained that the regency's limited capability to repair the
damaged roads was caused mainly by a lack of money.
	   Funds allocated for road development and repair total only Rp 6
billion (US$521,000) annually, of which Rp 1.2 billion is spent on
periodic projects, Rp 2.5 billion on procurement, Rp 1.6 billion on
employees' salaries, Rp 0.6 billion on asphalt and Rp 0.2 billion
on fuel.
	   Eddie said that the damage was caused mainly by heavy goods
vehicles using the roads that were not designed to accommodate such
vehicles.
	   Moreover, the city's poor drainage system combined with heavy
rainfall deteriorates the condition of most roads, he said.
	   The other cause of the damage is the actual poor quality of the
roads, he added.

Three Britons jailed for killing a fourth on Spanish island 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A British bar owner was sentenced to 27
years in jail on Tuesday for hiring two bouncers to kill her
partner on the Spanish island of Tenerife where they lived. The
bouncers received 29-year terms, a spokesman from the court said.
	   The court heard that Jackie Ambler, 33, hired Stanley Stewart
and Gary Holmes to kill 39-year-old Michael O'Hara with whom she
lived and owned a British-style pub called Stevies Bar on the
resort island located off the Moroccan coast.
	   Ambler denied the charges that she offered Stewart and Holmes
54,000 pounds (dlrs 33,000 at today's rate) to murder O'Hara who
was found beaten to death in the bar in September 1995.
	   At the trial Stewart and Holmes retracted earlier confessions.
Holme's said he had killed O'Hara in a fight over drugs and that
Stewart had attempted to separate them, news reports said.
	   Ambler and O'Hara were originally from Yorkshire in northern
England, Stewart from Scotland and Holmes from southern county of
Sussex.

Virgin Islands government eases barge rule 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The government on
Tuesday relaxed a proposed rule that prohibited commuters from
accompanying their cars on the ferry trip between two of the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   The rule, approved by the Public Services Commission last week,
outraged residents of St. John who commute to the larger island of
St. Thomas. The ruling required drivers to put their cars on a
cargo ferry, then board a separate passenger ferry.
	   After a meeting between Gov. Roy Schneider and commission
chairman Walter Challenger on Tuesday morning, Schneider
spokeswoman Jeanette Millin said the rule had been changed to allow
the driver and one passenger to accompany each car.
	   Commission members said they were trying to prevent travelers
from packing into cars to save money on tickets.
	   One ferry company, Varlack Ventures Inc., claimed it was losing
dlrs 500,000 annually because of the practice.

Police prevents French stunt climber from scaling Warsaw skyscraper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Security agents on Tuesday prevented a
stunt climber from scaling Warsaw's 41-story Marriot hotel.
	   Making his first appearance in eastern Europe, Alain Robert,
dubbed the Spiderman for climbing skyscrapers using only his bare
hands, was stopped when he appeared on the roof of a shopping
center surrounding the hotel.
	   Simultaneously, a Polish climber, Jacek Jurkowski, managed to
mislead the security agents and climbed up to the 10th floor, while
about 5,000 people cheered below. After about 15 minutes, Jurkowski
climbed down.
	   Invited by a Polish company manufacturing climbing gear, Robert
said he would try to scale the 146-meter glass tower at another
time, the PAP news agency reported.
	   Robert, 35, of Valance, France, makes his living scaling tall
buildings as publicity stunts. He uses only his bare hands and no
cords or rigging.
	   He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the world's
fifth-tallest _ the Empire State Building in New York City.
	   In April, he scaled the famed Obelisk at the Place de la
Concorde in Paris.

Israeli legislature votes to dismantle shrine at gunman's grave 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's legislature voted Tuesday to dismantle
the makeshift shrine that has sprung up at the grave of an Israeli
gunman who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers.
	   In the attack four years ago in the West Bank town of Hebron,
Brooklyn-born Baruch Goldstein opened fire with an automatic rifle
on Muslim worshippers kneeling in prayer at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews.
	   The makeshift shrine that has sprung up around Goldstein's
well-tended grave in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, just
outside Hebron, has become a point of pilgrimage for Jewish
extremists.
	   ``What we have today is a memorial and not just a grave,'' said
Ran Cohen, the opposition lawmaker who introduced the bill to take
down the shrine.
	   Objects to be removed include a cabinet containing a Torah, a
case of religious books, and benches and lamps. The grave itself
will not be moved.
	   Cohen said that if the grave continues to be a focus of
pilgrimage, he will introduce a new bill calling for the removal of
the grave itself.

Neither sandwiches nor questions are up to Holyfield's tastes AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield didn't like the sandwiches or
the questions about his motivation as he and Henry Akinwande got
together Tuesday for the final time before they fight for the
heavyweight title.
	   The bread on the turkey sandwiches was too hard for Holyfield's
tastes. So he sipped a Coke and scoffed at those who might question
how he seriously he can take Akinwande in the wake of two wins over
Mike Tyson and a bit of revenge against Michael Moorer.
	   ``People wonder if I can get up for this fight,'' Holyfield
said. ``They shouldn't. I'm up for every fight.''
	   That Holyfield's state of mind is the most important topic
leading into Saturday's fight at Madison Square Garden says a lot
about the title defense against Akinwande, Holyfield's first fight
since he beat Moorer Nov. 8 to add the IBF portion of the
heavyweight title to the WBA title he won from Tyson.
	   Simply put, the 6-foot-7 (1.97-meter) Akinwande isn't considered
by many to be much of a challenge to Holyfield despite his imposing
height and a 33-1-1 record marred only by a loss to WBC champion
Lennox Lewis.
	   ``They said the same thing about Holyfield before he fought
Tyson,'' Akinwande said at Tuesday's final pre-fight press
conference. ``I've made a good living proving people wrong in this
sport.''
	   Akinwande, by virtue of his No. 1 ranking by the WBA, is getting
his second heavyweight title shot in less than a year despite an
embarrassing performance last July against Lewis in which he was
disqualified in the fifth round.
	   He's not the opponent Holyfield wants in the twilight of his
career, but with Tyson still sidelined and his camp unable to make
a deal with Lewis for a title unification, Akinwande is all he's
got.
	   ``I have a job and my job is to win,'' Holyfield said. ``I win
and everything takes care of itself. I just go out there and
execute and then say, `Next.'''
	   Holyfield will earn some dlrs 10 million for the scheduled
12-round fight, which tops a card that features 46-year-old Roberto
Duran seeking a sixth title in his 116th pro fight against WBA
middleweight champion William Joppy. Also on the card is junior
bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia in a non-title fight and women's
fighter Christy Martin.
	   The purse will boost Holyfield's career earnings to some dlrs
185 million but figures to do little to enhance a legend created
when he beat Tyson in successive fights.
	   Still, Holyfield and those around him bristle at the suggestion
that an Akinwande fight is something less than a top heavyweight
title bout.
	   ``People can characterize it as something else but to us it's a
big fight,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer and manager. ``If
it doesn't come out the right way, it becomes a huge fight.''
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title.
	   ``There's no other reason to fight him other than he's ranked
No. 1 and that's what the rules are,'' Holyfield said.
	   Should Holyfield beat Akinwande _ and he is a 7-1 favorite to do
so _ talks could begin in earnest again for a Lewis fight that
would probably take place sometime in the spring. If the two
fighters still can't get together to unify the title, Holyfield
would find himself faced with yet another mandatory challenge, this
one against IBF No. 1 contender Vaughn Bean.
	   ``They didn't become No. 1 because they're not good fighters,''
Holyfield said. ``Besides, I tend to bring out the best in other
fighters.''

Six Rwandans convicted for killing U.N. monitors killing of four U.N. human rights monitors; details; comments.

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan court has convicted and
sentenced to death six Hutu rebels for the 1997 killing of four
U.N. human rights monitors, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The monitors, a Briton, a Cambodian and two Rwandans, and their
driver were ambushed near Cyangugu, 240 kilometers (150 miles)
southwest of the capital, Kigali, and on the border with Congo,
where the Hutu rebels cross easily in and out of the country.
	   A court in Cyangugu delivered the verdict on May 26, but it was
not reported until Tuesday.
	   The six rebels _ five men and one woman _ were arrested shortly
after the Feb. 4, 1997, ambush. They were charged in March with the
murder, armed robbery and endangering state security.
	   The incident led rights monitors to restrict their movements,
making it tougher to gather reports on human rights violations
outside Kigali. Last month, the government decided to suspend the
U.N. mission until a new mandate is negotiated.
	   Thousands of people have been killed in rebel attacks and army
reprisals since more than 1 million Hutu refugees returned from
exile in November 1996. Tutsis control the government in Rwanda
after toppling the Hutu-led regime that orchestrated the genocide
of 500,000 minority Tutsis in 1994.
	   So far, Rwandan courts have convicted and sentenced to death
more than 100 people in connection with the 1994 slaughter. Firing
squads publicly executed the first 22 convicts on April 24. In
total, 130,000 people are awaiting trial in overcrowded jails
throughout Rwanda.
	   On Monday, Geoffrey Gatera, a former surgeon and the dean of the
medical faculty at the University of Butare, was convicted on
genocide charges and sentenced to death.
	   Gatera was accused of taking part in the massacres of Tutsis at
the Butare hospital, 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Kigali,
where he was working at the time.
	   Meanwhile, a British diplomat leading a European team to the
Great Lakes region of Central Africa said European Union
legislators were preparing a common position on what to do with the
Rwandan genocide suspects residing in EU countries.
	   The Rwandan government has criticized European nations for
harboring genocide suspects.
	   ``We're engaged in discussions about how to secure the arrest of
the genocide culprits in each of the EU countries,'' Tony Lloyd
said after talks with the Rwandan leaders in Kigali.

Eds: UPDATES with detail, complete list of players
<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, healed from a
potentially season-ending right thigh strain, was included in
Italy's final list of 22 players for the World Cup announced
Tuesday.
	   Del Piero's inclusion meant the automatic exclusion of Parma's
striker Enrico Chiesa, who was a possible substitute for the
23-year-old star of Juventus. Del Piero, who was injured during the
Champions Cup final against Real Madrid, will resume full-time
training with the teammates later this week.
	   Del Piero is considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup.
	   ``Indications of the team doctors (about Del Piero's recovery)
are positive,'' coach Cesare Maldini told Italian television after
a match in Sweden Tuesday night.
	   The list also included Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo, a
last-minute substitute for injured No.1 goalie Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Peruzzi, of league champion Juventus, pulled a muscle in
training at Coverciano Sunday.
	   Inter Milan keeper GianLuca Pagliuca is expected to be on
Italy's starting lineup in France with Parma's Gianluigi Buffon and
Toldo as substitutes.
	   Del Piero, who traveled to Goteborg with the Italian team but
did not even sat on the substitutues bench for the warmup game
against Sweden, was declared fit by team doctors after careful
examinations over the weekend.
	   Italy's official World Cup roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalkeepers: Gianluca Pagliuca (Inter Milan); Gianluigi Buffon
(Parma); Francesco Toldo (Fiorentina).
	   Defenders: Giuseppe Bergomi (Inter Milan); Fabio Cannavaro
(Parma); Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini (AC Milan);
Alessandro Nesta (Lazio); Gianluca Pessotto and Moreno Torricelli

Mariners' Cora says he'll retire after 1999 season 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Seattle Mariners All-Star second
baseman Joey Cora says he plans to retire after the 1999 season in
order to spend more time with his family, a newspaper reported.
	   ``I'm going to finish this season and take the option for '99
and that's it,'' Cora, 33, told El Nuevo Dia. ``I've thought it
over and feel comfortable with the decision. I'll retire after
1999.''
	   His remarks were published in Saturday's editions of the
newspaper.
	   Cora said that constant travel and a desire to spend more time
with family motivated the decision.
	   ``People don't understand that. In baseball, life is good and
there is good money, but the trips here are brutal,'' he said. ``I
want to enjoy life with my wife and my family. When you're in
baseball, you forget other things.''
	   Cora, who was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, played in 1987 with
the San Diego Padres and was traded in 1991 to the Chicago White
Sox. In 1995 he signed with the Mariners as a free agent and hit
.300 last season.
	   Cora said he hadn't decided what he wanted to do after 1999 but
would consider scouting or working with a team in Puerto Rico _
``but not as a coach and not as a manager.''

Federal grand jury indicts Bowe for allegedly abducting wife, children AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA
<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Former undisputed heavyweight
champion Riddick Bowe was indicted Tuesday for allegedly abducting
his estranged wife and their five children from their suburban
Charlotte home and driving them to Virginia.
	   A U.S. District Court grand jury named Bowe in a one-count
indictment charging him with interstate domestic violence. He faces
up to 10 years in prison and a dlrs 250,000 fine if convicted.
	   Judy Bowe and the couple's five children were uninjured in the
alleged Feb. 25 abduction, authorities said.
	   U.S. Attorney Mark T. Calloway said he could not comment on the
specifics of the incident, but Cornelius, North Carolina, police
chief Ron McKinney said it began when Bowe drove to his wife's home
in the trendy north Charlotte suburb along Lake Norman.
	   Bowe ordered his wife and children into the car and began
driving toward his home in Fort Washington, Maryland, McKinney
said. Bowe went some 200 miles before stopping at a fast food
restaurant in South Hill, Virginia, where Judy Bowe was able to get
to a telephone and call her sister, Lynette Shaw, in Cornelius.
	   Shaw called Cornelius police, who in turn alerted their
counterparts in South Hill, and they went to the restaurant and
spoke with the couple. Judy Bowe told authorities she and her
children did not want to go to Maryland, so South Hill police
arranged for them to be transported back to Cornelius.
	   Authorities decided they needed to conduct additional interviews
and consult state police in North Carolina and Virginia as well as
the FBI before making a decision on whether to arrest Bowe,
McKinney said.
	   Later in the day, Bowe entered a medical treatment facility for
counseling and therapy, according to Rock Newman, who managed
Bowe's boxing career.
	   The boxer has had other troubles since leaving the sport.
	   In May 1997, shortly after Bowe announced his retirement, he and
his sister, Velma Melton, were involved in a spat in which both
reportedly got split lips. Bowe quickly announced a reconciliation.
	   Bowe joined the Marine Corps Reserve in 1997 and reported to
Parris Island, South Carolina for three months of basic training,
but he dropped out 11 days later.
	   Bowe was unbeaten in 31 fights and at the top of his game when
he outpointed Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight
championship on Nov. 13, 1992. He lost the WBC title outside the
ring when he didn't fight Lennox Lewis of Britain. He lost the WBA
and IBF titles by majority decision to Holyfield on Nov. 6, 1993.
	   Bowe didn't lose another fight, but he also never again looked
like a dominant fighter, with the exception of a sixth-round
knockout of Jorge Luis Gonzalez June 17, 1995. On Nov. 4, 1995, he
got up from a knockdown to stop Holyfield in the eighth round of a
non-title fight.
	   In his last two fights, both in 1996 against Andrew Golota, he
won on disqualifications. He was taking a beating in both fights
when Golota was disqualified.

Malone knows it's time for some serious Jazz AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Once again, the Utah Jazz have placed
their National Basketball Association championship hopes on the
chiseled shoulders of Karl Malone.
	   If this is the year the Jazz end the Chicago Bulls' dynasty of
the '90s, Utah must have a big series from their superstar power
forward who endorses Rogaine, rides a Harley and is the proud new
papa of a baby girl.
	   ``The pressure on me personally? I don't think you guys even
know,'' Malone said Tuesday after the Jazz's last practice before
Wednesday night's series opener. ``I realize I have to bring my `A'
game.''
	   A year ago, in Utah's first trip to the finals, Malone admits
the pressure got to him. He was trying to prove he deserved his MVP
award and sometimes forced things.
	   ``It was decent,'' he said of his play. ``It wasn't outstanding
or great or nothing. It was probably a C-plus or maybe a B as far
as my thinking. I think with the MVP stuff, maybe I felt that
instead of just playing my game.''
	   Now, Malone said, he is much more relaxed.
	   ``It's not an excitement attitude. It's not a don't care
attitude. It's kind of in between,'' he said. ``Sometimes it seems
like I play my best when I have that kind of attitude.''
	   Malone put a little more pressure on himself and his fellow Utah
post players when he said, ``This series is going to be won with
our big guys.''
	   ``I'm going to issue that challenge right now to myself and to
the other guys,'' Malone said. ``Our guards have helped us big men
a lot. It's our time now to return the favor. We don't disrespect
their big guys, but we do feel we can do more to help our guards
and small forwards out.
	   ``If we're to win this series, our big guys have to do a great
job on the boards, myself included, and we have to play a great
defensive help game to help our guards out.''
	   Chicago has no one to match up well with Malone. Luc Longley,
bigger and slower, will start out defending him. Dennis Rodman also
will get a turn. Last year, Brian Williams came off the bench, and
his ability to run the court with Malone was a big reason the Bulls
won the series in six games.
	   But Williams is gone, and no one on the Chicago bench seems able
to fill that role.
	   ``It's going to be tough. We're going to have to find some
matchups for Malone,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``He's definitely going
to be able to get out and run on our big men, especially if Luc is
guarding him, or Dennis, who wants to bang the boards and be a
rebounder.''
	   Fouls could be a big problem for the Bulls.
	   ``One of the most important things for me to do is be aggressive
out of the gate,'' Malone said. ``Instead of settling for jump
shots, maybe take it to them and hopefully get their big guys in
foul trouble, get them back on their heels.''
	   The Bulls know all to well that Malone can create a foul mood.
He led the NBA in free throws attempted.
	   ``It's really difficult to guard Karl Malone because the
slightest touch and you're going to get a foul,'' Rodman said.
``Here in Utah, you don't get any calls at all. There's nothing I
can do except go out and play hard and try to throw him off his
game.''

Johnson's loss nothing to worry about, yet AP Track Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Michael Johnson's uncharacteristic
defeat in the 200 meters of the Prefontaine Classic wasn't a
shocker to him or his coach because of his lack of training and
racing.
	   The loss for the 1996 Olympic gold medalist came Sunday, when he
finished third at Eugene, Oregon in a wind-aided 20.28 seconds,
nearly one second off the world record of 19.32 he set during the
Atlanta Games.
	   Johnson was beaten by Maurice Greene, the winner in 19.88, and
Obadele Thompson, the runner-up in 20.17.
	   ``We had no illusions coming in since the guys he was running
against had run more meets (this year) than Michael,'' coach Clyde
Hart said Tuesday.
	   Hart, also the coach at Baylor, said Johnson began training
three months late for this season because of injuries from last
year, the worst being a right quadriceps strain during a 150-meter
match race against Canadian Donovan Bailey at Toronto in June.
	   In addition, there are no Olympic Games or world championships
this year, so there was no desperate need to begin training early,
Hart said.
	   The coach added that ``Michael's training is going well. He's in
good 400 condition now.
	   ``But he's not going to win every time he runs,'' Hart said.
``Michael has to get some good 400s under his belt, then the fast
200s will come.
	   ``He just has to get in more training. He's using this week to
train and reload.''
	   Hart said that the quadriceps injury ``appears totally healed,
but whether it's 100 percent, we don't know.''
	   Johnson also recently missed a week of training because of a
``flareup'' in his leg, Hart said.
	   ``When the nagging injuries go away, he'll be all right,'' Hart
said. ``There's no need to panic. Nobody's pushing the panic
button.
	   ``Michael's high intensity comes when he's healthy. It's a
matter of getting his work in and getting in races.''
	   Johnson's next scheduled meet is the USA Championships at New
Orleans, beginning June 19, but Hart said he might bypass the
nationals to concentrate on training.
	   ``He might say I want to train another three weeks,'' Hart said.
``He has to be comfortable that he's ready to run. Michael's speed
is always best when he's stronger.''

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Pinch-hitter Jason Hardtke singled home the
winning run in the ninth inning Tuesday, and the Chicago Cubs beat
Florida 2-1 to send the Marlins to their seventh straight loss.
	   Mickey Morandini reached on an infield single off Felix Heredia
(0-3) with one out and advanced on a balk. Sammy Sosa then hit a
ball between Heredia's legs for an infield hit, and Mark Grace was
walked intentionally to load the bases.
	   Jay Powell relieved and Hardtke, batting for Terrell Lowery, hit
a soft fly ball into the gap in left center, giving Chicago its
fifth consecutive victory.
	   Terry Adams (4-3) pitched one hitless inning. Cubs starter Mark
Clark allowed one run and eight hits in eight innings.

Nicaragua restricts offer to take Cubans 
</HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A war of words between Cuba and
Nicaragua's fiercely anti-communist president is continuing to heat
up _ with Cubans trying to leave their homeland trapped in the
verbal cross fire.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman repeated Monday night that his
government is willing to accept 191 Cubans who fled by raft to the
Bahamas, but were then returned to Cuba last month. But, he said,
Nicaragua would not automatically accept other Cubans.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has said it would allow anybody to go to
Nicaragua _ anybody but those specified by Aleman because they had
violated the law by leaving without government permission.
	   ``From the beginning I indicated that we would give humanitarian
asylum to those who have run the risk of their lives and their
children fleeing Cuba and who arrived by raft in the Bahamas,''
Aleman said. ``We cannot receive thousands and thousands here in a
poor country.''
	   He apparently was responding to critics who accused him of
opening the door to extensive Cuban migration.
	   Following Aleman's statements offering asylum for the returned
refugees, Cuban police imposed tight security around the Nicaraguan
embassy in Havana, apparently to prevent a rush of visa-seekers of
the sort that set off the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when 125,000
refugees fled Cuba for Florida of 1980.
	   In a jab at Cuban President Fidel Castro, Aleman added that the
refugee problem ``could be easily resolved if instead of receiving
so many thousands of people here, we received only two people:
Fidel and Raul,'' a reference to Castro's brother Raul, Cuban vice
president.
	   ``I am sure that then there would not be any more rafters. That
problem would be solved,'' said Aleman, who befriended anti-Castro
groups, when he opposed Nicaragua's pro-Castro Sandinista
governments of the 1980s.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Cubans have fled their Communist
country since the Castro-led revolution of 1959, many setting out
on rafts in hopes of reaching the United States. Some opposed
Castro, some feared him and some sought greater economic
opportunity abroad.
	   But the repeated floods of rafters led many countries to reach
agreements with Cuba to return illegal Cuban immigrants to their
homeland.

Neither sandwiches nor questions are up to Holyfield's tastes AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to DELETE extraneous ``he.''
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield didn't like the sandwiches or
the questions about his motivation as he and Henry Akinwande got
together Tuesday for the final time before they fight for the
heavyweight title.
	   The bread on the turkey sandwiches was too hard for Holyfield's
tastes. So he sipped a Coke and scoffed at those who might question
how seriously he can take Akinwande in the wake of two wins over
Mike Tyson and a bit of revenge against Michael Moorer.
	   ``People wonder if I can get up for this fight,'' Holyfield
said. ``They shouldn't. I'm up for every fight.''
	   That Holyfield's state of mind is the most important topic
leading into Saturday's fight at Madison Square Garden says a lot
about the title defense against Akinwande, Holyfield's first fight
since he beat Moorer Nov. 8 to add the IBF portion of the
heavyweight title to the WBA title he won from Tyson.
	   Simply put, the 6-foot-7 (1.97-meter) Akinwande isn't considered
by many to be much of a challenge to Holyfield despite his imposing
height and a 33-1-1 record marred only by a loss to WBC champion
Lennox Lewis.
	   ``They said the same thing about Holyfield before he fought
Tyson,'' Akinwande said at Tuesday's final pre-fight press
conference. ``I've made a good living proving people wrong in this
sport.''
	   Akinwande, by virtue of his No. 1 ranking by the WBA, is getting
his second heavyweight title shot in less than a year despite an
embarrassing performance last July against Lewis in which he was
disqualified in the fifth round.
	   He's not the opponent Holyfield wants in the twilight of his
career, but with Tyson still sidelined and his camp unable to make
a deal with Lewis for a title unification, Akinwande is all he's
got.
	   ``I have a job and my job is to win,'' Holyfield said. ``I win
and everything takes care of itself. I just go out there and
execute and then say, `Next.'''
	   Holyfield will earn some dlrs 10 million for the scheduled
12-round fight, which tops a card that features 46-year-old Roberto
Duran seeking a sixth title in his 116th pro fight against WBA
middleweight champion William Joppy. Also on the card is junior
bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia in a non-title fight and women's
fighter Christy Martin.
	   The purse will boost Holyfield's career earnings to some dlrs
185 million but figures to do little to enhance a legend created
when he beat Tyson in successive fights.
	   Still, Holyfield and those around him bristle at the suggestion
that an Akinwande fight is something less than a top heavyweight
title bout.
	   ``People can characterize it as something else but to us it's a
big fight,'' said Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer and manager. ``If
it doesn't come out the right way, it becomes a huge fight.''
	   Holyfield was to have fought Lewis to unify the heavyweight
championship for the first time since Riddick Bowe threw the WBC
belt into a garbage can after his win over Holyfield in their first
fight.
	   But with Holyfield wanting dlrs 20 million for the fight and
Lewis unwilling to give up his relationship with the HBO network,
talks collapsed and Holyfield was left only with the option of
taking a mandatory title defense to keep his WBA title.
	   ``There's no other reason to fight him other than he's ranked
No. 1 and that's what the rules are,'' Holyfield said.
	   Should Holyfield beat Akinwande _ and he is a 7-1 favorite to do
so _ talks could begin in earnest again for a Lewis fight that
would probably take place sometime in the spring. If the two
fighters still can't get together to unify the title, Holyfield
would find himself faced with yet another mandatory challenge, this
one against IBF No. 1 contender Vaughn Bean.
	   ``They didn't become No. 1 because they're not good fighters,''
Holyfield said. ``Besides, I tend to bring out the best in other
fighters.''

Avalanche pick Hartley as coach AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Colorado Avalanche, stunned by Marc Crawford's
resignation last week, hired Bob Hartley as their new coach on
Tuesday.
	   Hartley, a veteran of minor league coaching, spent the last two
years as head coach of the Hershey (Pennsylvania) Bears, Colorado's
top farm club in the American Hockey League. He is a longtime
friend of Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix.
	   ``I am thrilled and excited, yes, but also confident and
convinced that I will be able to fulfill my duties very well,''
Hartley said.
	   The Avalanche began looking for a coach last Wednesday after
Crawford rejected a contract extension that would have kept him in
Colorado through the 2000-2001 season.
	   Hartley immediately was dubbed the front-runner to succeed
Crawford. He led Hershey to the American Hockey League title in
1997.
	   Before taking over in Hershey, Hartley coached Colorado's former
AHL affiliate in Cornwall for three seasons. He also has coached in
the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.
	   ``I am convinced that (Hartley) is ready to coach at the highest
level in the National Hockey League,'' Lacroix said. ``Bob is
without a doubt part of the elite group of the young coaches in
professional hockey today. In my mind he represents the logical
choice for the future of the hockey club.''

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A top leader of the violent Armed
Islamic Group in the capital has been killed in a gunbattle that
killed six other people including two children, authorities said
Tuesday.
	   Mohamed ``Layachi'' Kebaili and three gunmen had taken the two
children hostage in the suburb of Bab Ezzouar east of Algiers when
the gunbattle occurred overnight Monday, an official statement
said.
	   After a final police assault, all six inside, plus a policeman,
lay dead, the statement said.
	   Kebaili had hidden among villagers in the suburb while carrying
out massacres in the region, local resident said. Kebaili was also
linked to terrorist attacks in the capital over the last three
years.
	   The Armed Islamic Group, known by its French initials GIA, is
the most violent movement in a six-year-old Muslim insurgency that
began when the military-backed government canceled January 1992
elections.
	   The conflict has left more than 75,000 people dead.

Albright: Economic progress in LatAm, but major problems persist sting money-laundering operation and Cuba 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright comments on an undercover
<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Democracy and free-market economic
reforms have helped reduce rural poverty and improve the lives of
women in Latin America, but major problems persist, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
	   ``Despite the progress, huge challenges of underdevelopment
remain,'' Albright told the Organization of American States. The
benefits of open societies and open markets must be delivered to
``not just some, but all of our people.''
	   The three-day OAS meeting, which ends Wednesday, has addressed
subjects including corruption, drug trafficking, poverty and
consolidating democracy.
	   Albright also said Tuesday that an undercover money-laundering
sting operation in Mexico, dubbed ``Operation Casablanca'', had
suffered from a lack of coordination.
	   Some 160 Mexicans were charged in the operation by U.S.
authorities in the one of the largest money-laundering probes in
history. Five Venezuelan bankers also were indicted.
	   Mexico's foreign secretary, Rosario Green, earlier criticized
the United States for not keeping Mexican authorities informed of
the three-year operation. Albright and Green met Monday night to
discuss the tensions.
	   ``Obviously there needs to be better coordination in terms of
our joint efforts dealing with money laundering and
narcotrafficking,'' Albright said at a news conference.
	   Albright also rejected suggestions by some countries that Cuba
be readmitted to the OAS. It was thrown out in 1962 after the
United States accused Cuba President Fidel Castro of supporting
leftist rebels in the region.
	   Addressing foreign ministers from 34 countries, Albright said
children are staying in school longer, women are gaining more
access to education and health care, and 1 million people are to
receive loans for micro-enterprises in the next few years.
	   Still, overall poverty in the region has gone up since 1980,
with a record 210 million people now below the poverty line,
according to the OAS.
	   Latin America suffers the greatest gap between poor and rich in
the world; in some countries, 10 percent of the population controls
50 percent or more of the wealth, the OAS says.
	   Albright's visit to Caracas was to end Tuesday when she departs
for Washington, then to Geneva for talks on nuclear testing in
India and Pakistan. She urged OAS delegates to strongly condemn the
testing.

Nicaragua restricts offer to take Cubans 
</HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A war of words between Cuba and
Nicaragua's fiercely anti-communist president is continuing to heat
up _ with Cubans trying to leave their homeland trapped in the
verbal cross fire.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman repeated Monday night that his
government is willing to accept 191 Cubans who fled by raft to the
Bahamas, but were then returned to Cuba last month. But, he said,
Nicaragua would not automatically accept other Cubans.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has said it would allow anybody to go to
Nicaragua _ anybody but those specified by Aleman because they had
violated the law by leaving without government permission.
	   ``From the beginning I indicated that we would give humanitarian
asylum to those who have run the risk of their lives and their
children fleeing Cuba and who arrived by raft in the Bahamas,''
Aleman said. ``We cannot receive thousands and thousands here in a
poor country.''
	   He apparently was responding to critics who accused him of
opening the door to extensive Cuban migration.
	   Following Aleman's statements offering asylum for the returned
refugees, Cuban police imposed tight security around the Nicaraguan
embassy in Havana, apparently to prevent a rush of visa-seekers of
the sort that set off the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when 125,000
refugees fled Cuba for Florida of 1980.
	   In a jab at Cuban President Fidel Castro, Aleman added that the
refugee problem ``could be easily resolved if instead of receiving
so many thousands of people here, we received only two people:
Fidel and Raul,'' a reference to Castro's brother Raul, Cuban vice
president.
	   ``I am sure that then there would not be any more rafters. That
problem would be solved,'' said Aleman, who befriended anti-Castro
groups, when he opposed Nicaragua's pro-Castro Sandinista
governments of the 1980s.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Cubans have fled their Communist
country since the Castro-led revolution of 1959, many setting out
on rafts in hopes of reaching the United States. Some opposed
Castro, some feared him and some sought greater economic
opportunity abroad.
	   But the repeated floods of rafters led many countries to reach
agreements with Cuba to return illegal Cuban immigrants to their
homeland.

Iraq finalizes plans for oil prices under U.N. deal With UN-Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday finalized and submitted to
the United Nations the price at which it will sell oil during the
fourth phase of the oil-for-food program.
	   Iraq also has started signing contracts with ``a number of
international'' oil buyers, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
an unnamed Oil Ministry spokesman as saying.
	   It did not say what the price was or name the buyers.
	   The submission of the oil price formally clears the way for
starting the expanded phase of the oil-for-food program under which
Iraq will be able to sell dlrs 5.2 billion worth oil over the next
six months.
	   The money can only be used to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods.
	   INA quoted the spokesman as saying that the oil ministry also is
actively trying to finalize deals to buy spare parts for its
battered oil industry.
	   In the previous three six-month phases of the deal, Iraq was
permitted to sell only dlrs 2 billion worth oil. The third phase
ends Wednesday.
	   Iraq has been banned from freely exporting oil under sanctions
imposed in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait,
touching off the Gulf conflict. After a U.S.-led coalition drove
the Iraqis from Kuwait, the Security Council agreed to maintain
sanctions until inspectors certified Iraq had destroyed illegal
weapons.
	   The oil-for-food deal was started in December 1996 to help
alleviate hardships imposed on Iraqi citizens by U.N. economic
sanctions.
	   Also Tuesday in New York, Iraqi officials tried to convince the
U.N. Security Council that Baghdad has destroyed all illegal
weapons and therefore met the terms for ending economic sanctions.
U.S. and British diplomats said they remained unconvinced.

Detroit makes mistake-prone Dallas pay AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DENNE H. FREEMAN
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings know the best thing the
Dallas Stars have going for them is their doggedness.
	   ``They're persistent,'' said Detroit forward Darren McCarty.
``Any time you play them you know they are going to play hard for
60 minutes. We will have to match them again. You won't win many
games against Dallas unless you do.''
	   Dallas will throw everything it has left against the defending
Stanley Cup champions Wednesday night to stave off elimination. The
Red Wings hold a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference finals.
	   Sometimes, Dallas' aggressiveness isn't a good thing. The Stars
tend to make mistakes that Detroit has been quick to capitalize on.
	   ``This game is all about taking advantage of mistakes and that
is where Detroit is outplaying us,'' Dallas center Brian Skrudland
said.
	   Mike Modano, normally the Stars' most-explosive scorer, but
limited to one goal this series, said every time Dallas makes an
error Detroit makes them pay.
	   ``It is just one or two things that cost us the game,'' Modano
said. ``It is a never-ending battle with little mental breakdowns
we have during the game. It all adds up.''
	   Dallas posted the best regular-season record in the National
Hockey League by feasting on opponent's mistakes. In the playoffs,
the Stars have scored only two power-play goals, making it even
more important for them to create turnovers.
	   ``We have to turn things around,'' said right winger Pat
Verbeek. ``We have to make our own breaks, our own luck. Things
haven't come easily to us all year long. We're just looking at this
as a new challenge.''
	   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said the Stars' frustration has
reached the boiling point.
	   ``We are getting a lot of energy from our players, but to beat a
championship team you have to be better in every way,'' he said.
``Just being even isn't enough. Detroit has gotten some breaks. But
they've earned them. We have to earn ours. We have to take out our
frustration on the ice and play smart. We haven't been playing
smart.''
	   Detroit is seeking to become the first repeat champion since
Pittsburgh in 1992.
	   Coach Scotty Bowman of Detroit said the Red Wings have played
like champions in crunch time.
	   ``We have done a good job of playing well when the games have
been on the line,'' Bowman said. ``But we can't let down. I believe
we have too much respect for Dallas to do that.''

Au pair's mother says she will support campaign to free death row inmate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The mother of British au pair Louise Woodward will
campaign for the release of a British-born convicted killer on
death row in the United States who she believes is innocent, Press
Association said Tuesday.
	   The British domestic news agency reported that Susan Woodward
has said in a letter that she and her daughter will publicize the
case of Kenny Richey, 33, who was convicted of aggravated murder
for starting a June 1986 fire at an apartment in Ottawa, northwest
Ohio, which killed 2-year-old Cynthia Collins.
	   ``Louise has been deeply upset about Kenny, she realizes only
too clearly how easy it is to be convicted in America without any
evidence. Even when there is clear evidence of innocence, this is
ignored,'' Press Association quoted Susan Woodward as saying in the
letter, written to friends of Richey campaigning for his release.
	   Mrs. Woodward has been campaigning for her own daughter after a
Massachusetts jury convicted Louise Woodward, 20, last fall of
second-degree murder of Matthew Eappen, the 8-month-old boy in her
care. Judge Hiller Zobel set aside that verdict and sentenced her
instead to manslaughter and the 279 days in prison she had served
since her February 1997 arrest.
	   Volunteers working for the Louise Woodward Campaign for Justice
said Tuesday that Mrs. Woodward would not comment on the letter,
which was released by friends of Richey.
	   Prosecutors say Richey used gasoline and paint thinner to set a
fire in the apartment of the child and her mother, Hope Collins.
Campaigners for Richey believe he is innocent and that new evidence
is being ignored by U.S. and British governments.
	   Mrs. Woodward said Louise would also arrange magazine
subscriptions for him while she waits in Massachusetts for a
verdict on her appeal from the Supreme Judicial Court.
	   ``Soon I will have the ears of the press at my disposal again,
they are just waiting for Louise to come home,'' the agency quoted
Mrs. Woodward as saying. ``I know they will be round like bees
around honey and then I will have the opportunity to speak out.''
	   Mrs. Woodward also said that pressure from the British
government could help Richey, and compared his case to that of two
British nurses released in May from a Saudi prison after being
convicted last year in the killing of a fellow nurse.
	   ``It seems that, like our cases, there was little or no
investigation and whatever little investigation took place was
biased,'' Press Association quoted Mrs. Woodward as saying.
	   Richey's mother Eileen, 53, who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland,
said she hoped the support would help to free her son.
	   ``I just want him home. The pressure has been immense and
although Kenny has some good support, we really appreciate the
Woodward family's help,'' Mrs. Richey said.

Six Rwandans convicted for killing U.N. monitors CLARIFIES that driver was wounded but survived. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with possible motive, EDITS to tighten,
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan court has convicted and
sentenced to death six people for the 1997 killing of four U.N.
human rights monitors, the Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The monitors and their driver _ one Briton, one Cambodian and
three Rwandans _ were ambushed near Cyangugu, 240 kilometers (150
miles) southwest of the capital, Kigali, and on the border with
Congo, which the Hutu rebels easily cross. The driver was wounded
but survived.
	   A court in Cyangugu delivered the verdict on May 26, but it was
not reported until Tuesday. The five men and one woman were
captured shortly after the February 1997 attack and charged in
March.
	   Authorities have said the six were Hutu rebels intent on
destabilizing the government.
	   The killings have severely restricted the activities of U.N.
human rights monitors. Last month, the government decided to
suspend monitoring activities until it negotiates a new agreement
with the United Nations.
	   Meanwhile, a British diplomat leading a European delegation to
the Great Lakes region of Central Africa said European Union
legislators were drafting a policy for dealing with suspects in the
1994 genocide who are residing in EU countries.
	   ``We're engaged in discussions about how to secure the arrest of
the genocide culprits in each of the EU countries,'' Tony Lloyd
said after talks with the Rwandan leaders in Kigali.
	   Rwandan government has criticized European nations for harboring
genocide suspects.
	   So far, the Rwandan courts have convicted and sentenced to death
more than 100 people in connection with the slaughter of at least
500,000 mostly minority Tutsis in 1994.
	   Firing squads publicly executed the first 22 convicts on April
24. In total, 130,000 people are awaiting trial in overcrowded
jails throughout Rwanda.
	   On Monday, Geoffrey Gatera, a former surgeon and the dean of the
medical faculty at the University of Butare, was convicted on
genocide charges and sentenced to death.
	   Gatera was accused of taking part in the massacres of Tutsis at
the Butare hospital, 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Kigali,
where he was working at the time.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraqi officials tried Tuesday to convince
the Security Council that Baghdad has met the terms for ending
economic sanctions by destroying all illegal weapons. U.S. and
British diplomats said they remained unconvinced.
	   An Iraqi delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, met with council envoys for nearly three hours, one day
before the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, is
expected to present evidence he says casts doubt on Iraqi claims
that it is no longer holding illegal arms.
	   Destroying all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons is the main condition for the council to end the
crippling sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   Al-Sahhaf refused to speak with reporters after the meeting. But
British Ambassador John Weston dismissed the Iraqi presentation as
``an exercise in obfuscation.''
	   ``Iraq once again says the problem is U.N. inspection teams of
the Security Council, that they're being unfairly treated but the
facts are different,'' U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said. ``Iraq
is concealing weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and
biological. They don't want to accept reality. They failed to
provide documents.''
	   Russia's deputy U.N. envoy, Yuriy Fedotov, called the meeting
useful but said the atmosphere was ``not very pleasant. The room
was too small.''
	   Slovenia's U.N. ambassador, Danilo Turk, reserved judgement
pending Butler's briefing Wednesday. But he added: ``I don't think
the evidence they produced is final.''
	   During the briefing Wednesday, Butler will attempt to shore up
support for his position that significant gaps remain between what
his U.N. Special Commission believes Iraq was holding before the
1991 Gulf War and what the Iraqis have disclosed.
	   Commission sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, admit
they have lost ground in the political battle to convince all 15
Security Council members that Iraq has failed to disclose all
information about its weapons programs _ especially in the chemical
and biological fields.
	   Russia, France and China are urging the commission to accelerate
its accounting of Iraqi weapons so that sanctions can be ended.
Pressure has increased since Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed a
deal with the Iraqis in February to open Saddam's palaces and other
sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.
	   U.N. inspectors have not visited any palaces or other sensitive
sites since April 2 for fear that failure to find any weapons
caches will only undermine their argument that Iraq has still not
come clean.

Guerini wins grueling 17th stage, Pantani takes pink jersey 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes
<TEXT>
	   SELVA DI VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani, the best
``Giro'' climber, beat Alex Zuelle by more than four minutes in
Tuesday's grueling 17th stage of the Tour of Italy ending in the
Dolomite mountains and snatched the pink jersey of overall leader
from his Swiss rival.
	   The bald-headed ace of the Mercatone Uno team placed second to
fellow-Italian Giuseppe Guerini at the finish line in this resort
of the Gardena valley and achieved his goal to wear the pink jersey
for the first time in his career.
	   With the two next stages including mountainous passes and uphill
finishes, Pantani has the chance to strengthen his lead and win the
1998 Tour of Italy which ends in Milan Sunday.
	   The stage victory was the first ever by Guerini at the Giro.
	   Pantani and Guerini broke away as the road climbed to the Fedaia
pass _ the next to last in a stage including four passes _ and
Zuelle quickly slid three minutes behind.
	   The leading duo widened the advantage on the last mountain
before the finish _ the Giro highest point at the 2,214-meter high
Sella Pass - and Guerini won the two-way sprint at ease.
	   Zuelle, an against-the-clock specialist who had beaten Pantani
by more than three minutes in Sunday's individual time test at
Trieste, finished 4:37 minutes behind on Tuesday and fell to fourth
overall, 1:01 minutes behind the new leader.
	   Guerini completed the 217-kilometer (134.5-mile) stage from
Asiago to Selva di Val Gardena in six hours, 16 minutes, 58
seconds.
	   Pantani, who trailed Zuelle by 3:48 at the start of the 17th
stage, vaulted from fourth to first place in the standings 30
seconds ahead of Russian runnerup Pavel Tonkov, who finished fourth
at Selva di Val Gardena.
	   Guerini moved to third overall, only one second behind Tonkov, a
Giro winner in 1996.
	   ``When I attacked, along with Guerini, I just wanted to reduce
my gap from Zuelle,'' Pantani explained at the finish line, after
spraying cheering fans with champagne from the podium.
	   Thousands of enthusiastic people lined along the roads taking to
the Dolomite passes and to the finish line of the toughest Giro
stage so far.
	   ``I did not believe that Zuelle could lose so much. After the
bad beating suffered in the time trial (Sunday) I was dreaming of
revenge, of a day like today,'' Pantani said.
	   Pantani, 28, was a champion of bad luck in 1995 when he suffered
two consecutive bad spills and a broken leg. He was sidelined for
the entire 1996 cycling season.
	   Colombian Chepe Gonzales, who placed third 2:04 minutes behind
the winner, was one of the day heroes as he led on the road
climbing to the Fedaia pass and surrendered to Pantani and Guerini
only on the last tough uphill section of Sella, named Cima Coppi
after the late Italian ``Campionissimo'' Fausto Coppi.
	   Zuelle, who already lost and recaptured the pink jersey twice in
the current Giro, will have an opportunity to fight back in the
next-to-last stage Saturday, an individual time trial of 34
kilometers (21 miles) in the Swiss lake resort of Lugano.
	   Defending Giro champion Ivan Gotti, suffering from back pains
and with a gap of 12:42 minutes overall, did not start Tuesday.
Those who retired during the stage included Italian top sprinter
Mario Cipollini, winner of four stages this year.
	   Wednesday's leg of 115 kilometers (71.3 miles) ends at 1,760
meters of altitude of Alpe di Pampeago.

Lucien Freud nude of Jerry Hall unveiled at Tate Gallery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Art gallery visitors can now see supermodel Jerry
Hall from a whole new angle. A nude portrait of a pregnant Hall was
unveiled Tuesday at London's Tate Gallery as part of a new
collection by British artist Lucien Freud.
	   The postcard-sized painting of the Texan model, measuring just 6
inches (15 centimeters) by 4 inches (10 centimeters), shows the
wife of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger lying on one side, pregnant with
her son Gabriel, now 6 months old.
	   ``She wondered whether I'd like to paint her in this condition
and it was too generous an offer to refuse,'' Freud recently said
of his painting. ``I'm especially glad I did it because it led to
my now painting her with her baby.''
	   The painting is on show with 24 of the painter's other works at
the Tate until July 26.
	   Freud's painting Large Interior, W11 (After Watteau) recently
set an all-time high for a living British artist when it fetched
more than 3.5 million pounds (dlrs 5.7 million) at auction.

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Dan Serafini won in his first appearance of
the season, and Otis Nixon and Brent Gates had four hits each
Tuesday to lead the Minnesota Twins over the Oakland Athletics
10-3.
	   Serafini, recalled from the minors on May 27, allowed three runs
and five hits in 6 2-3 innings with five strikeouts. It was his
second appearance against the A's, the first since a five-hitter
last Sept. 8 _ the only complete game of his career and his first
win.
	   Nixon went 4-for-4, getting two infield singles. Gates was
4-for-5, matching his career high for hits.
	   Minnesota had 15 hits in all, and every starter scored at once.
The Twins led 8-1 after three innings and have outscored opponents
120-61 in the first three innings this year.
	   Tom Candiotti (4-6) was pounded for eight runs and eight hits in
2 2-3 innings.
  Orioles 9, Mariners 8, 10 innings
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro hit his second game-winning homer
in as many games, a two-run shot in the 10th inning that carried
the Orioles past the Seattle Mariners.
	   Palmeiro connected off Bobby Ayala (0-5) after Harold Baines
opened the inning with a single. Ken Griffey had given Seattle the
lead in the top of the ninth with his second homer of the game, a
solo drive off Norm Charlton (1-1).
	   Palmeiro's 14th homer marked yet another collapse by Seattle's
faulty bullpen and ended a second straight slugfest between the
teams, who combined for eight homers Monday night in the Orioles'
10-9 victory.
	   Griffey had three hits, including a three-run homer and his 21st
of the season in the 10th. Alex Rodriguez hit his 21st home run for
the Mariners, who have a team-record 13 homers in their last three
games and a major league best 97 for the season.
	   The Orioles got a three-run homer from Brady Anderson, a two-run
drive from Cal Ripken and a solo shot from B.J. Surhoff.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move
on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology stocks recovered partially from
Monday's bruising selloff, but the broad market Tuesday again
failed to hold most of their gains as mounting worries about
company profits prevailed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
31.13 points _ or 0.35 percent _ to 8,891.24 after sliding from an
early 54-point gain to a 50-point loss. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank's executive board approved a
dlrs 225 million rural poverty reduction loan for Indonesia on
Tuesday but did not act on a dlrs 1 billion bank credit to help
shore up the troubled nation's economy. Both loans had been
scheduled for approval by the bank's board on May 19 but were
halted as escalating civil unrest that culminated in President
Suharto's resignation forced the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to evacuate staff and suspend operations in Jakarta,
the capital. As for the dlrs 1 billion loan, Graham Barrett, a
spokesman for the bank's East Asia operations, said, ``We need to
take into account the events of the last several weeks before we
close off on the loan and submit it to the board.'' (US-WORLD
BANK-INDONESIA)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan may have to declare a
moratorium on repaying its debts as international sanctions bite
into its reserves, say financial analysts. The government also may
devalue the Pakistani currency by 3-5 percent to discourage imports
that are further draining the economy, said a report by the Dutch
ABN Amro Bank NV obtained Tuesday. The grim outlook from one of
Pakistan's top independent analytical groups was a result of a drop
in Pakistan's international credit rating following sanctions
imposed after it exploded a series of nuclear tests last month. The
governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Mohammed Yaqub, said the
government had no intention of defaulting on its debts.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish forestry group Stora said
Tuesday it plans to merge with Finnish forestry company Enso,
creating the world's largest producer of paper and board. ``The
merger is based on the excellent strategic fit between these two
strong companies, creating a global player in an increasingly
competitive industry,'' said Claes Dahlbaeck, chairman of Stora.
Dahlbaeck will become chairman of the new company, to be called
Stora Enso. Stora and Enso together had about 90 billion kronor
(dlrs 11.7 billion) in sales in 1997. Each employs about 20,000
people. The merger will save 1.9 billion kronor (dlrs 2550 million)
per year in operating costs, Stora said. (SWEDEN-STORA-ENSO)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Tuesday
denounced the U.S. decision to limit imports of EU wheat gluten
over a three-year period and warned of retaliation. The quota,
``represents a major restriction on European exports,'' the EU
executive Commission said in a statement. ``This action is all the
more surprising coming from a government that only two weeks ago
was calling on WTO members to further liberalize trade in
agricultural products.'' The EU head office was considering
``appropriate responses'' but gave no immediate details. EU
spokesman Gerard Kiely said the quota suggested Washington will
defend free farm trade if that serves American farmers only. The EU
has nabbed 30 percent of the American wheat gluten market.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars on
Tuesday called a 430 million pound (dlrs 700 million) bid from
Volkswagen a good, solid offer _ and said any last-minute
approaches would face big obstacles. Plans to sell Rolls-Royce to
the Germans were thrown somewhat into question Monday, when a group
of Rolls-Royce enthusiasts said they were planning a higher bid
with the intent of keeping the company British. Vickers PLC has
called a special meeting Friday for shareholders to vote on
Volkswagen's offer. The company has not yet received any kind of
bid from the British group, which calls itself Crewe Motors and is
run by a lawyer, Michael Shrimpton, who previously led a failed
effort to bid for Rolls-Royce. Vickers has acknowledged any that
last-minute bid, if credible, could force it to delay its plans.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Two years after winning a breach-of-contract
lawsuit, Maximilian Schell got a post-appeal boost in his judgment
against a German producer
	   Superior Court Judge Joseph R. Kalin increased the award by dlrs
167,000 on Sunday to compensate the actor for delays in payment by
Wolfgang Bocksch.
	   Schell already had won nearly dlrs 406,000 on his claim that
Wolfgang Bocksch Concerts canceled a European production of ``My
Fair Lady'' one month ahead of schedule in 1994.
	   The producer's attorneys said Bocksch was justified in breaking
the contract because Schell, 68, didn't fulfill his duty to
publicize the play, which was canceled because of dwindling
audiences.
	   Kalin ruled that Schell, who won the 1961 best actor Oscar for
``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' made all reasonable requests for
publicity. Bocksch appealed but lost.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda comforted
himself during five months of detention with poetry, hymns and
thoughts of Princess Diana.
	   Kaunda never met Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris last
year, but he ``felt greatly touched by her.''
	   ``I am very moved when people do good things for fellow man,''
Kaunda said of the late princess's charity work. ``I've been trying
to write something on Diana.''
	   Kaunda, 74, spoke Tuesday with The Associated Press at his home
on his first day of freedom. The state dropped charges that he
concealed knowledge of plans for a coup attempt last year.
	   After his arrest on Christmas, Kaunda was put in prison and then
under strict house arrest.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While Viagra may have brought many couples
closer together, the impotence drug has ruined at least one
relationship.
	   Roberta Burke, 61, appeared in state Supreme Court in Mineola
Tuesday to bring a dlrs 2 million lawsuit against her longtime
companion 70-year-old Francis Bernardo claiming that Viagra
prompted him to leave her.
	   Before Viagra, Ms. Burke said Tuesday, ``I was looking forward
to our old age, holding hands and walking on the beach.''
	   She says her man was impotent until he popped the tiny blue pill
on May 1. They had sex for the first time in four years, said her
lawyer, Dominic Barbara. Two days later, Ms. Burke says, Bernardo
walked out, leaving a note boasting of his prowess.
	   Bernardo didn't appear in court Tuesday.
	   Sex researchers have said the allegations demonstrate the
dangers for some relationships when men take Viagra and suddenly
have an increased interest in sex.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Is your hotel bill too high? An Israeli hotel
will let you work off part of the tab.
	   Starting this week, the dlrs 95-a-night Candle of the Jordan
hotel in Tiberias will let guests clean rooms or toil in the
kitchen for dlrs 8.50 an hour. The hotel said a visitor suggested
the pay arrangement.
	   Guests are allowed to work off half the price of their stay when
they make reservations at the hotel from Sunday through Wednesday.
	   The savings is significant: About 5 1/2 hours of grunt work
would shrink the nightly cost to dlrs 47.
	   The hotel has branches in Tel Aviv and Netanya, but only the
Tiberias branch is offering the discount.
	   The hotel said it did not expect many guests to take advantage
of the offer.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A harpooned whale fighting for its life
rammed the Norwegian boat that shot it, breaking the vessel's mast
and hurling two crewmen into the icy waters.
	   The whale escaped, but it was unclear if it survived, the Oslo
newspaper Verdens Gang reported Tuesday. The two crewmen, one of
whom suffered cracked ribs, were rescued.
	   According to the paper, the whaling boat, the Bolga, was off
Norway's northern tip on Monday when it harpooned a minke whale,
which can grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) in length.
	   The whale then rammed the 53-foot-long (16-meter-long) wooden
boat. The two crewmen, who had been spotting whales from the crow's
nest near the tip of the mast, were thrown into the ocean, about
425 miles (685 kilometers) north of the Arctic Circle.
	   Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993, despite a ban imposed
by the International Whaling Commission.

Chairman of disgraced gold company hospitalized in the Bahamas 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ David Walsh, the disgraced president and chief
executive of Bre-X Minerals Ltd., iss hospitalized after he
suffered a heart attack during the weekend, the Canadian Press news
service reported.
	   Officials with Doctor's Hospital in Nassau confirmed late
Tuesday that Walsh was registered as a patient, but refused to give
any other details.
	   Earlier, a Reuters report said the former Calgary mining
promoter was in critical condition.
	   Walsh, whose now-infamous company rose to fame on the strength
of an Indonesian gold find that was exposed last year as a fraud,
moved to the Bahamas after the scandal broke in March 1997. The
scam cost investors more than dlrs 3 billion.
	   Walsh's Toronto lawyer, Alan Lenczner, was not immediately
available to confirm the report.
	   Walsh, a former stock promoter, remains one of the key figures
in what began as one of the most sensational rags-to-riches stories
in the history of gold mining and ended in scandal.
	   Bre-X was a tiny Calgary, Canada-based company that dazzled
investors with its spectacular Busang gold find. It rose from
penny-stock obscurity to become a darling of financial markets.
	   It all evaporated in the spring of last year as shareholders
realized the Busang deposit, said to contain 200 million ounces of
gold, was a scam orchestrated by former Bre-X geologist Michael de
Guzman.
	   It was de Guzman's suicidal leap from a helicopter over the
Indonesian jungle in March 1997 that first signaled to investors
that something was amiss.
	   A private investigator later determined de Guzman and a handful
of other Bre-X employees sprinkled gold dust bought from a Borneo
tribesman into selected ore samples _ a practice called salting _
before the samples were tested.
	   The salting began in December 1993 and was intended to
discourage the company from shutting down the Busang project.
	   Bre-X also earned Canada's financial services industry a global
reputation as an unregulated frontier where mining frauds are
prevalent and easy to commit.
	   Since May, a barrage of shareholder lawsuits have been launched
against Bre-X and its senior officials, securities regulators and
several brokerage firms which promoted the stock.
	   The company itself was petitioned into bankruptcy in November
after an Alberta court refused to extend its protection deadline.
	   Walsh resigned as chairman shortly afterward. In May, a Bahamian
court froze his assets in that country.
	   Former Bre-X executive John Felderhof, de Guzman's boss,
retreated to the Cayman Islands shortly after the engineering
report on the Busang fraud was released. He has denied any
knowledge of the scheme.

details of the meeting. Members of the church delegation left Cuba
early Tuesday and could not be reached.
	   But the group earlier said it found that Pope John Paul II's
January visit ``has benefited all Christians'' in Cuba.
	   The council noted that Cuban Protestants claim that rapidly
growing attendance at their churches equals that at Catholic
churches in Cuba _ with roughly 600,000 regular worshipers for all
Christian faiths.
	   Catholic church officials insist that their own attendance still
out paces that of Protestants on the island, which was historically
Catholic prior to the 1959 revolution.
	   The National Council of Churches represents 34 Protestant and
Orthodox denominations with 52 million members in the United
States.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An election tribunal has ruled
that a third term for Argentine President Carlos Menem would be
``unconstitutional,'' adding fuel to an ongoing political debate
over his intentions.
	   A growing number of provincial governors, lawmakers and other
members of Menem's Peronist party are presenting court petitions
for a third run.
	   In its second ruling since April, the National Electoral Court
on Monday declared Menem ``unable able to seek a third mandate''
because of constitutional provisions barring re-election.
	   The decision by Argentina's top election court came in response
to a lawsuit by a lawyer pressing for a definitive ruling by the
judiciary.
	   With the 1999 ballot still months away, whether or not Menem can
seek a third term has been the subject of vocal debate nationwide
that could go as far as the Supreme Court before the issue is
settled.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Roman Catholic bishops from
throughout Latin America will meet this month to urge forgiveness
of much of the region's immense debt, warning the problem otherwise
could cause a ``bloody revolution.''
	   ``Foreign debt is not only an economic problem, it is also a
human problem ... and it is bringing ever-greater poverty to Latin
Americans,'' Honduran Archbishop Oscar Andres Rodriguez, president
of the Latin American Episcopal Council, said Tuesday.
	   Rodriguez said the bishops would meet here June 29 and 30 to
discuss the area's estimated dlrs 600 billion debt.
	   Rodriguez said the bishops also were likely to urge richer
countries to aid Latin American development by reducing
protectionism and cutting interest rates on their loans ``because
economic relations between nations should be expressions of
justice,'' he said.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and
his wife, Ruth, will visit U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
wife, Hillary, at the Camp David presidential retreat this weekend,
the foreign ministry said Tuesday.
	   The meeting between the two first families will have no specific
agenda, said Luiz Neves, a director at Brazil's foreign ministry.
But, Neves said, the heads of state could talk about the nuclear
tests conducted by Pakistan and Indian, nuclear non-proliferation
in general, recent elections in Paraguay and the Southern Cone
Common Market, known as Mercosur.
	   The Cardosos were scheduled to arrive Saturday in Washington,
where they will attend the signing of an education agreement
between Brazil and the World Bank at Brazilian Embassy. On Sunday
they will head to Camp David in Maryland.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Quitting smoking can be profitable in
Chile.
	   Under the slogan ``quit and win,'' the Health Ministry organized
a contest offering prizes of cash and international trips to
smokers who quit during a two-month period.
	   A total of 11,400 contestants participated and dozens succeeded,
forcing the ministry to conduct a drawing to determine who would
receive three all-paid trips _ to Europe, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos
Aires _ as well as cash prizes ranging from dlrs 220 to 1,100.
	   Health Minister Alex Figueroa said the contest was considered
such a success that the experience will be repeated in two years.
	   Witnesses and tests were used to proof that the smokers had
actually quit.

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ When stray dogs recently gathered
around an open manhole, pacing and barking, the commotion led
police to another body.
	   A homeless man had climbed down into the tunnel, probably
seeking warmth from heating pipes, and died.
	   Solving the case wasn't tough. But removing corpses has become a
major problem for Vladivostok's cops these days.
	   A company created to pick up corpses has run out of money, and
with considerable reluctance, the beleaguered police force has been
handling the job.
	   Lacking proper equipment, officers sometimes transport bodies in
an open trailer hitched to the back of a police car. Sometimes they
flag down passing trucks to take bodies to the morgue _ although
they deny newspaper reports they were even stopping bread trucks.
	   ``Clearly we understand that would cause an epidemic,'' said
Deputy Police Chief Anatoly Petrusha. ``We'll usually just stop
trucks that have metal in the back, or maybe wood.''
	   The problem highlights the decline of public services in
Vladivostok, Russia's main Pacific port that has been crumbling due
to a lack of money, poor management and a relentless feud between
Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and regional Gov. Yevgeny Nazdratenko.
	   The mayor hasn't paid the company that collects corpses,
SpetsService, since 1996, even though he created it two years
earlier.
	   SpetsService wants 300,000 rubles (dlrs 50,000) a year, and
until the city pays up, it will pick up bodies only if relatives
foot the bill or if it's an emergency.
	   ``If the body is in the street or blocking traffic, then we'll
get rid of it,'' the company's boss, Yevgeny Osokin, said.
	   In the manhole death, police approached a number of onlookers,
seeking to borrow ropes, overalls and rubber boots _ and a
volunteer to go down to get the body.
	   ``We don't like to do it ourselves, and we can usually find
someone else who will do it,'' said Sgt.-Maj. Smekhun
Starsheserzhan. ``After they got the body out, we figured it had
been lying there for a month. By that time we couldn't tell what
the guy had died of.''
	   The police force has gotten no extra funds or equipment to deal
with the estimated 3,500 bodies they expect to collect this year in
the city of 800,000 people.
	   Last year, a diver drowned in ice-covered water during the
winter, but police didn't have the tools to reach him. Instead,
they had to wait for the spring thaw.
	   ``Someone finally called when the body floated to the surface
later in the spring, and we went out in a boat and picked it up,''
Starsheserzhan said.
	   The mayor and the governor blame each other for the problems
plaguing Vladivostok, while services continue to get worse. Their
quarrel, which has dragged on for years, is seen mostly as a bitter
personality clash.
	   Cherepkov was removed as mayor by presidential decree in 1994
amid corruption allegations. When he was returned in 1996, he said
SpetsService was full of criminals and refused to finance the
body-removal service.
	   The political feud has prevented any effective solutions to the
region's chronic energy problems, and during the past winter,
Vladivostok residents had to go without hot water and electricity
for stretches of up to 15 hours.
	   There's no escaping the city's problems, even in death.
	   ``In the past, it didn't matter if the corpses had relatives,
because the mayor paid for it and SpetsService did the job,'' said
police Maj. Alexander Blakzhin.
	   ``Now, if a man dies in his apartment, we'll go in and take a
look at him. If his relatives have money, they have to arrange to
remove him themselves.''

Archaeologists uncovering ruins of ancient paradise in Bahrain

	   SAAR, Bahrain (AP) _ In ancient times, the land of Dilmun was
described as a virtual Garden of Eden, a land where the wolf and
the lamb lived in harmony and youth was eternal.
	   Archaeologists today are uncovering more of that once-fabled
land, revealing a prosperous trading society that had such abundant
supplies of water that palm trees grew heavy with dates almost
without effort.
	   ``Fresh water just bubbled up out of the ground,'' said Jane
Moon, one of the directors of the archaeological expedition at
Saar. ``That must have been miraculous to Gulf people.''
	   Saar was one of the towns in ancient Dilmun, which at different
times encompassed what is now the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain
and parts of eastern Saudi Arabia.
	   In about 1900 B.C., Saar was one of several bustling towns in
Bahrain apparently ruled from a city whose ruins are beneath a
medieval fort six miles (nine kilometers) to the northeast.
	   Merchants in the area grew rich as ships laden with copper from
Oman stopped in Dilmun while traveling up the Persian Gulf to
Babylon in Mesopotamia, which is in modern-day Iraq. The copper was
later mixed with tin or lead to form bronze weapons and tools.
	   ``This very small island ... suddenly got hold of a somewhat
monopolizing role,'' said Dan Potts of Australia's University of
Sydney.
	   Dilmun was famous for its dates, which were popular in a region
where the fruit remains common. Pearls, believed to have been
called ``fish eyes'' in Mesopotamia, were also traded. In modern
times, Bahrain had a famous pearling industry.
	   Traders' seals found in Saar show motifs such as the double
swirl popular in Anatolia, likely evidence that trade routes
stretched as far as present-day Turkey. Some 50 seals, most round
and each about twice the size of a thumbnail, have been discovered.
	   Dilmun achieved everlasting fame in Mesopotamian religious
texts, where it was lauded in mythological terms.
	   One text says:
	   ``In Dilmun, the crow screams not,
	   the dar bird cries not dar-dar,
	   the lion kills not.''
	   Archaeologists say the same text shows the Mesopotamians viewed
Dilmun as a land of eternal youth. ``Its old woman says not `I am
an old woman.' Its old man says not `I am an old man,''' the text
relates.
	   Some experts say Dilmun's role as a port where ships took on
food and water may have led to its glorified image among the
Sumerians and later the Babylonians.
	   ``There really was the opportunity to pick up life-saving
sustenance there,'' said Gordon Davis of the University of Alabama.
	   Potts notes Dilmun myths predated major Bahrain settlements and
may have referred to earlier Dilmun communities in today's Saudi
Arabia.
	   The ruins of Saar _ the only complete town found from the Dilmun
period _ show some 80 stone houses, almost all with two rooms and a
courtyard. It is not clear how many people lived in each room.
	   Next to the town is a graveyard with about 1,000 tombs. Bahrain
is famous for having up to 150,000 burial mounds, but it's unclear
why so many exist.
	   At Saar's highest point sat a small temple for worship of local
gods that probably also was used as an administrative center.
	   ``It is a settlement with a lot of planning, a lot of
regularity,'' Potts said.
	   In March, Moon's team unearthed a kitchen, which had a bread
oven and a fireplace with supports for a cooking pot. The people
most likely ate dates, fish and gazelle meat. About 85 percent of
bones found at the site were from fish.
	   The town was abandoned in about the 17th century B.C. for
reasons that remain a mystery.
	   Moon theorizes a receding coastline prompted people to abandon
the site. Potts says an interruption in the copper trade or changes
in the water supply may have caused the town's demise.
	   No written records from the settlement have been found.

other big-time corporate producers brought to the New York theater
this season.
	   No wonder the 1998 Tony Award nominations were dominated by
several musicals produced by these companies, which are challenging
the old way of producing and selling shows.
	   Look for Disney's ``The Lion King'' and Livent's ``Ragtime'' to
divvy up the major musical and production awards Sunday (8 p.m. EDT
PBS, then 9 p.m. EDT CBS) when the prizes honoring Broadway's best
are handed out.
	   It's the most competitive Tony ceremony in years, not only in
the high-profile musical categories but also in drama, where a
surprising number of plays _ 19 in all _ competed for nominations.
Yet the quest for the best-play trophy is a two-horse race, with
either ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' or ``Art'' the most likely
winner.
	   One area where there is absolutely no contest is the musical
revival category _ with ``Cabaret'' an overwhelming favorite. Its
two stars, Natasha Richardson, as the extravagant chanteuse Sally
Bowles, and Alan Cumming, as the show's decadent master of
ceremonies, would appear to have the top musical performance awards
locked up, too.
	   Cumming's strongest competition will be Brian Stokes Mitchell,
the mesmerizing Coalhouse Walker of ``Ragtime.'' Mitchell was the
favorite before ``Cabaret'' opened, but now might divide votes with
his ``Ragtime'' co-star, Peter Friedman, who also was nominated.
	   Even Tony's television showcase has undergone considerable
change, thanks to the presence last year of Rosie O'Donnell,
happy-time talk show host and wide-eyed fan of the Broadway
theater. Until O'Donnell emceed last year's bash at Radio City
Music Hall, the TV show had been sliding steadily in the ratings.
CBS was making noises about not renewing its contract.
	   ``Moving the ratings up was definitely the biggest
accomplishment last year,'' O'Donnell says. ``I think it is real
important that it stay on network TV because, in the middle of the
country, not that many people are as familiar with PBS as they are
with CBS.
	   ``Plus I think it is important to stay on so we can encourage
the new young playwrights to continue to work.''
	   For O'Donnell, the 1997 ratings boost was doubly sweet.
	   ``The hardest part last year was just convincing some of the
Broadway community that I should do the show,'' she says. ``I think
there was a little bit of resistance at first. I had done a revival
of `Grease,' but that was all, and the Tony show always had been
hosted by very legitimate theater people.
	   ``Then came this girl with a big mouth from TV who wanted to do
it at Radio City. Who did she think she was? Now I think the
Broadway community knows I just want to help support it and try to
make the show the best that it can be in terms of an entertaining
two-hour program.''
	   If plays were much more of a presence on Broadway this season,
don't expect many that fail to win awards to be around very long.
In fact, one of the best-play nominees, ``Golden Child,'' closed a
week ago, unable to hang on to find out that it didn't get the big
prize.
	   The other best-play nominee is ``Freak,'' John Leguizamo's
autobiographical one-man show about growing up Latin in New York.
In ends July 4, not because of lack of business but because its
highly popular star has a film commitment.
	   ``Art'' by Yasmina Reza already is a big international hit,
scoring in Paris and London. The New York production repeated those
successes, pulling grosses each week that rival some musicals. The
show's principal competition is ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,''
introducing a young London-born playwright named Martin McDonagh to
New York audiences. Even if he doesn't win, the 27-year-old writer
will be heard from again.
	   Yet for glamour and high stakes, nothing tops the battle between
``The Lion King'' and ``Ragtime.''
	   In theater awards competition so far, the two have divided the
major prizes. ``The Lion King'' won the New York Drama Critics'
Circle prize, while ``Ragtime'' picked up the Drama Desk nod.
	   Both shows have been masterfully marketed by their producers.
Try watching a New York television station without seeing a
``Ragtime'' commercial. It's difficult to do. And Disney earned
enormous publicity for committing itself to the rebirth of Times
Square and, more specifically, the dlrs 34 million renovation of
the New Amsterdam Theater, which houses its musical hit.
	   It was an inspired decision by Disney executives Tom Schumacher
and Peter Schneider to hire avant-garde director Julie Taymor to
bring ``The Lion King'' to the stage. Taymor was something of a
triple threat off-off-Broadway. She did everything there from
directing to designing sets and costumes to even writing music.
	   Taymor is a favorite to pick up one Tony _ for direction of a
musical _ and she could win two more.

	   ``Ragtime'' is a musical done the old-fashioned way _ at the
instigation of a strong-willed and creative producer, Garth
Drabinsky. It was his idea to bring the E.L. Doctorow novel to the
stage. Drabinsky hired playwright Terrence McNally to adapt the
book and composer Stephen Flaherty and lyricist Lynn Ahrens to
write the score.
	   And the competition has even extended off-stage. In April, the
financially troubled Livent was taken over by a group of executives
led by Michael Ovitz and Roy Furman, a Wall Street entertainment
banker. Drabinsky was named the company's chief creator director.
	   Ovitz is a former Walt Disney Co. president who left in 1996
with a generous golden parachute. Now he has considerable say in
the running of one of its chief Broadway competitors.
	   Hallmark, the greeting card giant, made a sizable investment in
two big musicals this season _ a revival of ``The Sound of Music''
and a pop version of the old romantic potboiler ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel.'' The company has aggressively marketed both shows.
	   In the case of ``The Sound of Music,'' it has run television
commercials capitalizing on baby boomers' nostalgia for the show
and as something they should take their children to see. Its
persistence with ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' _ free mini-CDs in
copies of newspapers and other special promotions for example _ has
paid off with Tony nominations.
	   The show, panned by most critics, did get a best-musical
nomination, along with a nod for its swashbuckling star, newcomer
Douglas Sills.
	   And then there is the final best-musical nominee, ``Side Show,''
a sentimental favorite but a decided long shot. The tale of
real-life Siamese twins, it didn't catch on with the public despite
some good reviews. Many blamed the subject matter; others blamed
the musical's lack of marketing, including the absence of a
television commercial.
	   Imagine if Disney or Livent had been in charge of the ads. The
musical might still be running.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Royal Shakespeare Company is taking its show
on the road, leaving behind a trail of criticism.
	   The company can be seen in repertory in five productions, first
at New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music through June 7 and then at
the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., June 9-July 5.
	   The dlrs 2.2 million lineup offers an eclectic mix of the
company's house playwright, the Bard, who is represented by three
plays _ ``Hamlet,'' and the lesser-known ``Cymbeline'' and ``Henry
VIII.'' That trio will play in rotation with the allegorical
morality play ``Everyman,'' starring expatriate American Joseph
Mydell, and Samuel Beckett's solo piece, ``Krapp's Last Tape.''
	   Among the 50 actors on view will be Tony-winner Jane Lapotaire
(``Piaf'') as the ill-fated Queen Katherine in ``Henry VIII'' and
two-time Tony nominee Edward Petherbridge in three plays, including
``Krapp's Last Tape,'' which he also co-directed. Likely to be an
audience favorite is 40-year-old Alex Jennings, star of a
revisionist ``Hamlet'' that has been as popular with London
audiences as it was controversial among the critics.
	   It's the sort of array to make American theater companies drool,
since they operate in a cultural climate starved of finances and of
top-rank actors ready to commit to a season _ or more _ of work.
	   But those are precisely the issues the RSC has had to face of
late, while fielding mounting criticisms that a dlrs 50
million-a-year enterprise of some 29 annual productions spread
between five theaters has grown too unwieldy.
	   The RSC, playwright David Hare wrote in Britain's Observer
newspaper in May, ``is allowed to do dismal work with lavish,
unmerited subsidy, while brilliant young theaters ... offer 50
times the RSC's vitality on a fraction of its resources.''
	   Others merely wonder whether it may be time to give the Bard a
break. Perhaps, mused commentator Bryan Appleyard in The Sunday
Times of London, ``the greatest plays ever written ... read better
than they play.''
	   The carping falls mostly, and inevitably, at the feet of Adrian
Noble, the RSC's artistic director since 1990, who admits to
problems within the company but prefers to play up its strengths.
	   ``He's the greatest humanist writer of them all,'' Noble said of
the Bard, who gets performed in ``literally all four corners of the
known world.''
	   As for the company itself, Noble said, its very survival pays
tribute to a particular British tenacity.
	   ``The National Theater was set up by an act of Parliament,''
said Noble, referring to the RSC's principal rival. By contrast, he
said, ``the RSC was set up by an act of will _ no pun intended _ by
Peter Hall saying, `I want to create this company, and we will go
ahead and do it.' ''
	   Still, when the RSC is in top form, it is a company that is
second to none. In its 37 years, the RSC has largely prospered,
producing such well-traveled hits as ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,''
``The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby'' and even ``Les
Miserables,'' the pop musical that has provided a financial
lifeline for well over a decade.
	   Even this season, its productions of Ibsen's ``Little Eyolf''
and Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' _ the latter a co-venture with
London's Young Vic Theater _ have been among the year's most
revelatory.
	   The problems, as some describe them, lay in a company grown too
gargantuan for comfort and in the ethos of today's young actors,
who don't want the slow, steady apprenticeship that once turned Ian
McKellen, Glenda Jackson and Derek Jacobi, among many others, into
internationally known, award-winning stars. The past decade saw the
rise of eventual film stars Kenneth Branagh and Ralph Fiennes.
	   Trevor Nunn, a longtime RSC leader who now runs the National
Theater, recalls a time when attitudes were different.
	   ``When I ran the RSC for 18 years, there were always actors who
most passionately wanted to be part of the company,'' Nunn said.
``They didn't want to be part of anything else. They didn't want to
be out in that other life. They wanted continuity.''
	   Now actors mostly want flexibility. To that extent, long
contracts are out and shorter ones are in.
	   ``Leading actors can earn a lot of money in TV,'' Noble
acknowledged. ``They leave the RSC worse off. We should be under no
illusion about their financial hardship.''
	   To that end, Noble recently announced a new system of operations
to allow for two separate seasons instead of the usual, lengthier
one at the RSC's home base in Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's
birthplace.
	   In an effort to revitalize the repertoire, next season will see
major productions of Sheridan's 18th-century classic comedy, ``The
School for Scandal,'' and a stage version of C.S. Lewis' ``The
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,'' joining the Bard's ``Richard
III'' and ``The Winter's Tale'' on the Stratford main stage.
	   ``There is a danger of a decreasing pool of plays,'' said Noble,
since the 37-strong canon of Shakespeare's work can wear thin with
repetition. ``We want to address that.''
	   Also important is the need to refresh the most frequently seen
plays.
	   Director Matthew Warchus' current ``Hamlet'' cut liberally and
even did away with several characters without irrevocably
distorting the Bard's best-known tragedy.
	   ``I decided to make it a very personal production rather than an
exercise in proficiency and expertise,'' said Warchus, a Tony
nominee this year for his direction of the Broadway production of
Yasmina Reza's hit play ``Art.''
	   That explains a lively, if sometimes coarsely acted, staging
that chops the opening scene, the start of at least one key
soliloquy and all mention of the invading Fortinbras in an effort
to focus the play as a quintessential family drama.
	   ``It's wonderful to be in something that makes people excited
and also very cross,'' said Jennings, the leading player, who was
seen last season on Broadway in Noble's production of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream.''
	   But like many an RSC star past and present, Jennings looks
forward to a life beyond the company, where he can earn some decent
cash.
	   ``I'd just like to earn a lot of money, really,'' he said with a
smile. He quickly acknowledged, however, that the RSC does deliver
the goods, adding, ``It's the best.''

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ While hundreds of villagers carried
their injured on stretchers made of sticks and old clothes, aid
agencies appealed for more aircraft and fuel to rescue the badly
wounded in earthquake-stricken northern Afghanistan.
	   Aid workers said they were concentrating on helping the
survivors of Saturday's 6.9-magnitude quake and that it would take
weeks to get a clear picture of how many people were killed.
Estimates ranged from 2,000 to 5,000.
	   The quake struck an area that had been devastated just three
months earlier by another massive quake, which claimed about 2,300
victims.
	   Rescuers have reached only 29 villages, or about half of those
believed to have been hit hard by the temblor. Of those, 12 were
destroyed, or very nearly so, said Rupert Colville, a U.N.
spokesman.
	   In the village of Kol, hundreds of people swarmed a U.N.
helicopter that touched down on Tuesday. They had carried their
injured through the winding hillside streets, past crumbled
packed-mud houses, on makeshift stretchers.
	   On Monday and Tuesday, U.N. helicopters evacuated 50 of the most
seriously injured to emergency medical centers. They were working
from the dirt airstrip of Faisabad, still littered with the rusting
junk of old Soviet tanks and artillery from Afghanistan's
decades-long civil war.
	   Red Cross helicopters have delivered 2 tons of high-protein
biscuits, flour and oil to victims in Shari Basurkh, near the
quake's epicenter, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Faisabad,
the provincial capital of Badakhshan.
	   The villages' remoteness, lack of transportation and landslides
that have blocked roads were hampering the aid effort. The United
Nations, the Red Cross and other agencies have just three borrowed
helicopters delivering medical aid.
	   The helicopters came from neighboring Tajikistan, and Colville
said he hoped other neighboring countries would contribute as well.
Russia, which has loaned helicopters in previous disasters, said it
would consider sending aid.
	   The lack of aircraft ``is undercutting everything we are doing
now,'' Colville said.
	   He said the agencies needed at least one more cargo plane to
deliver supplies that had already been brought into the region
after the February disaster.
	   Throughout the quake zone, most of the injured were women,
children and the elderly, who had stayed inside their homes while
men worked the fields.
	   Mohammed Karim, who was in Faisabad when the quake hit his
village on the outskirts of Shari Basurkh, raced home with four
friends, walking the last few hundred meters (yards). They found
the village virtually gone.
	   ``We started digging. When we brought the people out they were
already dead,'' said Karim. ``We brought the bodies from under the
destruction and buried them without an Islamic prayer. We didn't
have time.''
	   The farmer lost all his relatives there _ more than a dozen
people among the village's 200 residents.
	   Most of the injuries were broken limbs, internal and head
wounds, said Svante Yngrot, a medical coordinator with the Red
Cross. Many of the survivors were still in shock, made worse by a
series of aftershocks.
	   ``The most traumatized were those who survived the February
quake, when they saw friends and relatives killed before their
eyes. Now they're going through it again,'' Colville said.

Report: North Korea may have at least one nuclear weapon 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese defense officials believe North Korea may
already have at least one nuclear weapon, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The Nihon Keizai business daily carried excerpts of what it
described as a Defense Agency internal report citing fears of
regional nuclear proliferation after India and Pakistan conducted
tests last month.
	   ``It's possible that North Korea is in possession of at least
one nuclear weapon,'' the agency report said, according to the
paper.
	   An agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity, would
say only that there remains ``doubt'' about the North's development
of weapons.
	   According to the newspaper, the agency document also expressed
fears that North Korea's rival, South Korea, might eventually move
to possess its own nuclear weapons in response.
	   The two countries fought the Korean War from 1950-53 and remain
technically at war, though attempts at finally forging a peace
treaty are under way.
	   The Nihon Keizai report comes amid heightened concern worldwide
over nuclear proliferation since the tests on the Indian
subcontinent.
	   North Korea agreed in 1994 to freeze and eventually dismantle
its nuclear weapons program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants and 500,000-ton annual fuel oil shipments until they
are completed.
	   The United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union are
supplying it with the reactors.
	   The Defense Agency report also expressed fear that the chance of
a nuclear war occurring in three regions of the world is growing.
	   It identified the regions as the Korean Peninsula, the Middle
East and the Indian subcontinent, according to the paper.

Annan envoy urges international community to aid Sierra Leone 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A special U.N. envoy is urging the world
not to wait for ``perfect peace'' in Sierra Leone and instead mount
a major humanitarian operation to rebuild the West African country.
	   ``If the international community adopts the attitude of `wait
and see' until there is perfect peace in the country, there's a
real democracy that the restored democracy ... will be seriously
jeopardized,'' Olara Otunnu told reporters.
	   Fighters loyal to the deposed military junta have been
terrorizing rural areas in an apparent campaign of revenge for
their ouster in February by Nigerian-led West African troops, who
restored a democratically elected government.
	   Otunnu, who returned recently from a four-day visit to the
country, said that ``contrary to the impression one may get from
outside,'' the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and the
West African peacekeeping force that restored him to power control
enough territory ``to allow for very serious programs of
rehabilitation and reconstruction.''
	   ``It is possible with concerted, prompt action, jointly by the
national government and the international community, to turn a
page,'' Otunnu said.
	   Otunnu said Kabbah's political legitimacy would make it easier
for the United Nations to mount an effective humanitarian
rehabilitation program in partnership with the local authorities.
	   Last month, the United States and the European Union accused
junta forces and its allies in the Revolutionary United Front of
engaging in ``horrific'' violence that has killed or maimed several
thousand people in recent months.
	   They said hundreds of people are being treated in hospitals
after rebels chopped off their arms, legs and ears with machetes.
Many women and children have been systematically raped, U.S. and EU
officials have alleged.
	   Otunnu said he visited one hospital in the capital Freetown
which had received more than 300 people who had lost limbs and
hands.
	   ``I will never forget the words of a young boy, must have been
about 5 years old, who told me after severing his hands, the RUF
soldiers then told him `go tell President Kabbah we are still
here,''' Otunnu said.
	   For its part, Otunnu said the government has promised not to
recruit youngsters into the ranks of the Kamajors, the paramilitary
force allied with Kabbah. Otunnu said the Kamajors had also agreed
to begin discharging ``child soldiers'' already in their ranks.
	   In addition, he said the government had agreed to protect
``child soldiers'' of the deposed junta and its still holding out
in rural areas.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Whether Austrian, German or English,
bookmakers are offering similar odds that Brazil will win its fifth
World Cup in France with a probable final against Germany.
	   Almost everything can be bet on at soccer's premier event.
	   Austria's Intertops is offering 30-1 odds against Germany's
first score coming through an own goal _ or a modest 1.5-1 payoff
if all World Cup goals total between 161 and 170.
	   The English and Austrian bookmakers, as well as Germany's
``Sportwetten Gera,'' all list Brazil as the clear favorite at
between 3.5 or 3.75-1 followed by Germany, 5.6-6 to 1, and host
France, 5.5-7 to 1.
	   The least likely final? Intertops is offering 750-1 that Denmark
will line up against Romania.
	   Ronaldo is the hands-down favorite to be the leading marksman,
followed by Argentina's Garbriel Batistuta. The bookmakers split on
whether Germany's Oliver Bierhoff or France's Stephane Guivarc'h
will finish third.

	   LESIGNY, France _ Romario broke down in tears Tuesday when he
was told he'd been dropped from Brazil's World Cup team.
	   Midfielder Emerson of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen was
called in to replace the hero of Brazil's 1994 cup-winning team,
who misses out with an injury to his right calf muscle.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo made a brief announcement at the team's
training headquarters and then turned the press conference over to
Romario, who was choked with tears and had trouble speaking.
	   ``Things are happy for some, sadness for others. But now I think
you're all sad as I am. I don't want to mean this is a farewell
from soccer,'' he said.
	   After breaking down again and covering his face with his hands,
Romario said: ``I will now probably learn how to value other
things.''
	   ___  
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne, the 31-year-old English
midfielder, said he was drunk the night before he was cut from the
World Cup team by coach Glenn Hoddle gave him the news.
	   Gascoigne spoke about the incident in a story in Tuesday's Sun
newspaper.
	   Often criticized for his reported hard-drinking and smoking 20
cigarettes a day, Gascoigne said he left the bar in La Manga,
Spain, had sandwiches in his room with teammate David Seaman, and
then ``crashed out.''
	   Gascoigne also said he had been drinking beer during a Sunday
golf game just hours before he met with Hoddle.
	   Given the bad news, the star of England's 1990 World Cup team
admitted he exploded.
	   ``I completely lost it. I went mad, berserk. I lost my rag big
time. I was shouting and swearing. I couldn't believe the injustice
of it.''
	   ___  
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Coach Hristo Bonev dealt soccer fans a
surprise Tuesday when he announced Bulgaria would be going to the
World Cup without playmaker Yordan Lechkov.
	   Bonev said that he had also dropped the third goalkeeper,
Radostin Stanev, and midfielder Kostadin Vidolov.
	   The goalie was dropped after first choice Borislav Mihailov _
one of the heroes at the 1994 World Cup _ recovered from an injury.
	   Lechkov had contributed greatly to the team's fourth place at
World Cup 1994. Bonev did not say why he was dropped.
	   The coach announced the 22-man roster after the team returned
from preparations in Germany. They included a 4-0 victory Monday
over German champion Kaiserslautern.
	   ___  
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran dropped two veteran strikers but added
two rookies to its 22-man World Cup squad announced Tuesday.
	   Coach Jalal Talebi sacked veteran strikers Alireza Emamifar and
Alireza Akbarpour to make way for newcomers, 22-year-old striker
Ali Latifi and 24-year-old midfielder Sattar Hamedani. Both rookies
play for local club Bahman.
	   Iran's three Bundesliga players, Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and
Khodadad Azizi, were included in the roster as was top goalkeeper
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh.
	   The team is in Croatia and will play a warmup against the
country's national team Wednesday before leaving for France.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Saeid Al Owairan, who scored the
most spectacular goal of the last World Cup, now has the
shaven-head look of Brazilian star Ronaldo.
	   Al Owairan drew attention with his weaving run through the
Belgian defense in the Saudis recent 1-0 victory in Washington.
	   ``I shaved all my hair off myself a couple of days ago because
it kept getting in my eyes,'' said the forward.
	   The Saudis are in action on the third day of the World Cup June
12, when they face Denmark in Lens.

	   CLAIRFONTAINE, France (AP) _ While his players were spending the
last three days with their families, French coach Aime Jacquet had
other worries. He had to watch video cassettes.
	   All during the three-day Pentecost weekend, Jacquet poured over
five video cassettes of the French team, looking for strategic
clues that might have eluded him on the sidelines.
	   On top of that he watched the latest games of South Africa,
against who France opens its World Cup campaign June 12, and two
each of potential second-round opponents Spain and Nigeria.
	   ``I saw all the cassettes of France and our opponents,'' said
Jacquet Tuesday.
	   But even after the bleary-eyed experience he admitted it didn't
amount to too much.
	   ``I still prefer the observations of our technical staff,'' he
said.
	   ___  
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, healed from a
potentially season-ending right thigh strain, was included in
Italy's final list of 22 players for the World Cup.
	   Del Piero's inclusion meant the automatic exclusion of Parma's
striker Enrico Chiesa, who was a possible substitute for the
23-year-old star of Juventus. Del Piero, who was injured during the
Champions Cup final against Real Madrid, will resume full-time
training with the teammates later this week.
	   Del Piero is considered a key to Italy's fortunes in the World
Cup.
	   ``Indications of the team doctors (about Del Piero's recovery)
are positive,'' coach Cesare Maldini told Italian television after
a match in Sweden Tuesday night.
	   The list also included Fiorentina's keeper Francesco Toldo, a
last-minute substitute for injured No.1 goalie Angelo Peruzzi.
	   Peruzzi, of league champion Juventus, pulled a muscle in
training at Coverciano Sunday.
	   Inter Milan keeper GianLuca Pagliuca is expected to be on
Italy's starting lineup in France with Parma's Gianluigi Buffon and
Toldo as substitutes.
	   ___  
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea has opted for a mixture
age and youth for its World Cup team, naming teenage rookie Lee
Dong-hook alongside veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong on its 22-man
roster.
	   Hwang, 29, South Korea's most famous player, returned to the
national team in April after a two-year break due to knee injury.
He has since scored three goals in seven World Cup warmup matches.
	   Forward Lee Dong-kook was the surprise selection. At 19, Lee
became the youngest South Korean ever to join the national soccer
team. Coach Cha Bum-keun said he was taking the rookie to France to
train him as South Korea's next-generation star.
	   ___
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ Cameroon announced Tuesday its final
World Cup squad, including some veterans, a new generation of
attackers _ and few surprises.
	   An expected omission from the team is Marc Vivien Foe, a
standout midfielder with French champion Lens, who broke his leg in
training in late May during the buildup to the World Cup.
	   Unexplained in his absence, however, was Tockene Bertin, a
defender expected to be a starter for the Indomitable Lions.
	   Veteran goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o, who plays for Deportivo La
Coruna in Spain, will anchor the team along with striker Francois
Omam-Biyick of Sampdoria in Italy.
	   Key young faces include attackers Alphonse Tchami of Hertha
Berlin in Germany and Salomon Olembe of Nantes in France.
	   ___  
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One of the biggest names in Japanese soccer was
dropped from the World Cup team Tuesday.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada said Kazuyoshi Miura, 31, would have no
chance to play, considering the team's ``pillar striker'' is
22-year-old Shoji Jo.
	   The announcement at the team's training camp in Switzerland is a
severe blow to Miura, the only Japanese to have ever played in
Italy's Serie A.
	   Ever since he was a teenager who went to Brazil to study soccer,
Miura had his heart set on taking Japan to the World Cup.
	   He was one of the key members of the Japanese team that failed
to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He scored a spectacular 14 goals
in qualifiers for this year's World Cup _ Japan's first.

Dollar edges lower, stocks fall in early Tokyo trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen early
Wednesday in line with its overnight moves in New York. Tokyo
stocks fell in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 138.60 yen in early trading, down 0.65 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
138.83 yen overnight.
	   The dollar slipped as traders speculated that the Group of Seven
major industrialized nations will jointly intervene to help boost
the sliding yen.
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar is likely to be supported
on the downside by strong dollar demand from Japanese investors.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reiterated
Tuesday that the U.S. policy on the yen's exchange rate has not
changed.
	   Rubin told reporters that Japan has been concerned about the
weakness of the yen, adding: ``we share the concern.''
	   On the stock market, share prices fell on profit-taking
following a 1.52-percent gain in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index the previous day.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 132.87 points,
or 0.85 percent, to 15,421.58 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Monday, the index had gained 233.42 points, or 1.52 percent.
	   Investors also were discouraged by an overnight fall on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.13 points,
or 0.35 percent, to 8,891.24.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.47 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,208.50.
The TOPIX rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent on Monday.
	   The benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.140 percent, up from Monday's finish of 1.130 percent,
driving its price lower to 112.51 yen from 112.59 yen.

Tough talk ahead of second-round negotiations Wednesday 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs. Talks resume at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT)

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Threatening a long and devastating strike, Air
France's leading pilots' union was talking tough after the first
round of negotiations in a walkout already disrupting some World
Cup preparations.
	   Talks were resume Wednesday afternoon on the third day of the
strike against the World Cup's official carrier, seven days before
the championship begins. It appeared virtually no progress was made
in the first round Tuesday.
	   After 5 1-2 hours of negotiations inside Air France headquarters
at Charles de Gaulle Airport, union leader Jean-Charles Corbet
said: ``The conflict continues; it will probably be long, it will
probably be tough.
	   ``These effects will probably be devastating on the balance
sheet and image of the company,'' said Corbet, head of the SNPL
union that represents most of the airline's 3,200 pilots.
	   He accused the airline's president, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, of
``contenting himself with renewing his demands'' during the talks.
	   There was no immediate comment from Air France.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   An Air France source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the airline held firm on 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in
annual salary cuts, but that it could eventually drop its two-tier
scale paying a lower salary to new pilots.
	   In an interview published in Le Parisien newspaper Tuesday,
Spinetta suggested postponing talks until after the World Cup ends
July 12.
	   He said the company was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs
16.7 million) per day during the strike, which was forcing tens of
thousands of people worldwide to look for other ways to travel.
	   Air France's main pilots' union called the 15-day action to
protest 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) in annual pay cuts.
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   At Charles de Gaulle airport, a shop employee sat alone Tuesday
in an empty store stocked with World Cup insignia. Opposite was a
newspaper stall where headlines read: ``World Cup held hostage,''
and ``World Cup in peril.''
	   After walking 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Paris to Chartres
over the weekend with 10,000 other youths on a pilgrimage, Ellen
Kerry was trying to get to New York on an Air France flight.
	   ``We only found out when we got in the taxi that there was a
strike. We could have saved the money and walked,'' said Kerry,
whose home is in Virginia.
	   At Marseille's Marignane Airport, passenger Pierre-Antoine
Graziani was getting fed up waiting to get on a waiting list to fly
to Paris.
	   ``I'm told something different from one hour to another,'' he
said. ``I might take my chances with the TGV,'' the high-speed
French train.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   But the U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday,
said it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines,
connecting to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses in France.
	   Former French player Michel Platini, co-president of the World
Cup organizing committee, accused the pilots Tuesday of ``taking
the country hostage. ... This is the image of France at stake, not
necessarily that of an airline.''

Argentine judge issues arrest warrants for IBM executives 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ An Argentine federal judge signed
international arrest warrants Tuesday for four current or former
IBM officials sought for questioning in an alleged kickback scheme,
the judge's aide said.
	   IBM Argentina has been accused of paying bribes to win a dlrs
249 million contract in 1994 to computerize state-owned Banco
Nacion, the country's largest bank.
	   Federal judge Adolfo Bagnasco signed the warrants Tuesday,
nearly one month after two ex-Banco Nacion directors admitted
having Swiss bank accounts containing cash they said they received
for steering the contract to IBM Argentina.
	   Bagnasco said he issued the arrest warrant after the suspects
failed to answer summonses to appear in court. ``There is no other
option but to have them sought by the police,'' he said.
	   The judge was expected to ask Interpol, the international police
agency, to arrest the IBM officials.
	   Fred McNeese, an IBM spokesman in the United States, said the
company has not received official notification that Bagnasco's
order had been signed.
	   But he repeated IBM statements that the four current or former
company officials are willing to testify before Bagnasco in the
United States under the terms of a bilateral U.S.-Argentine treaty.
	   ``They currently have no plans to go to Argentina,'' McNeese
said. He described allegations that the U.S.-based IBM officials
were aware of any alleged wrongdoing at its Argentine subsidiary as
``unsubstantiated.''
	   ``The simple fact is that Judge Bagnasco's investigation has
produced no evidence that they were aware of any misuse of funds
stemming from the Banco Nacion-IBM contract or that they were
involved in any wrongdoing,'' McNeese said.
	   The arrest warrants were for Peter Rowley, Robeli de Libero,
Steven Lew and Marcio Kaiser, all of whom worked in IBM's U.S.
headquarters at the time of the scandal, the aide said.
	   Kaiser and de Libero since have left the company, while IBM has
shifted the two other employees to posts unrelated to Latin
America, IBM officials have said.

Assault charged against Liam Gallagher dropped 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The victim of an alleged assault by
Liam Gallagher, singer with the British rock band Oasis, has
dropped criminal charges and will sue in the civil courts instead,
lawyers said Wednesday.
	   British backpacker Benjamin Russel Jones, 19, suffered a broken
nose, severe swelling and pain after an alleged headbutt from
Gallagher during Oasis' tour of Australia earlier this year.
	   In March, Gallagher was released on bail of U.S. dlrs 6,900
(10,000 Australian dollars) after being charged with assault
occasioning bodily harm.
	   He did not enter a plea and was due to face pretrial proceedings
next week.
	   But Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions Royce Miller said
Wednesday that Jones had asked that the charge be dropped.
	   ``The complainant doesn't wish to proceed with the criminal
prosecution and will pursue civilly,'' Miller said. ``He has asked
through his solicitors in London for the charge to be dropped.''
	   In a brief hearing in the Queensland Magistrate's Court, case
prosecutor Clare Carney said no evidence would be offered.
Magistrate Peter Mitchell then formally dismissed the charge.
	   Gallagher's Australian lawyer Terry O'Gorman said they had been
informed Jones would ``pursue his civil remedies against Mr.
Gallagher in the UK.''
	   The alleged assault occurred on March 5, as Jones tried to take
photographs of Gallagher outside a Brisbane hotel.

Former Mexico police chief says prosecutor ordered body dumped 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A state attorney general in Mexico ordered
officers to discard the corpse of a prisoner who had been tortured,
a former police chief has testified in a corruption case that
toppled the governor of central Morelos state.
	   Local newspapers also reported that police in several states
protected a Morelos-based kidnapping gang. Several papers published
a photo of kidnap suspect Daniel Arizmendi posing with a former
Mexico state police commander, both brandishing guns for the
camera.
	   In written testimony submitted Monday, former Morelos Judicial
Police Chief Jesus Miyazawa admitted knowing about the torture
killing of a prisoner by his officers.
	   Miyazawa said he accompanied officers involved in the killing to
a January meeting with Carlos Peredo Meredo, then attorney general
for Morelos. Miyazawa said the prosecutor not only failed to open a
criminal investigation of the case but told police to remove the
body from the police station and get rid of it.
	   A scandal erupted when traffic police in neighboring Guerrero
state discovered the chief of Morelos' anti-kidnapping unit and
other officers dumping the tortured body of Jorge Nava Aviles.
	   Peredo, Miyazawa and other top law enforcement officers were
fired and critics charged that state officials may have been
connected to some of the kidnapping gangs that have plagued the
area just south of Mexico City in recent years.
	   As the scandal over lawlessness grew, Gov. Jorge Carrillo Olea _
a former general who once headed Mexico's anti-drug efforts _ was
forced to step down last month.
	   Miyazawa said the fact he notified his superior, the attorney
general, proves he was innocent of charges of covering up Nava's
killing. Peredo's attorney told the dailies Reforma and El
Universal that the testimony did not implicate his client in any
crime.
	   Arizmendi's wife and son were arrested in raids on May 21, but
the alleged ringleader in scores of kidnappings himself has evaded
an extensive manhunt.

In unpredictable French Open, at least Hingis still on course

	   PARIS (AP) _ The French Open is a tournament where the
predictable almost never happens. So perhaps it shouldn't be a
surprise that the man many picked to win, Marcelo Rios, has been
ousted.
	   But at least one predictable phenomenon remains on course: the
onward march of Martina Hingis, the world's undisputed best player.
	   Hingis defeated Venus Williams Tuesday with such ease that it
put to rest any talk of a great rivalry _ at least for now.
	   Next, Hingis faces a newly inspired Monica Seles, a three-time
champion here, in one of Thursday's semifinals. No. 2 seed Lindsay
Davenport plays two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
other.
	   On the men's side, Rios, the No. 3 seed from Chile, blew his
chance to overtake Pete Sampras as the world's No. 1 player when he
lost 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to Carlos Moya.
	   Rios held that spot for a month earlier this year, and could
have reclaimed it with a quarterfinal victory.
	   With Davenport and Seles advancing, there are two American women
in the French Open semifinals for the first time since Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert reached the final four in 1987.
	   But there were none of the hoped-for echoes of Evert and
Navratilova when Hingis and Williams took the court for their much
anticipated match.
	   In a swirling wind that hampered both players, Hingis used her
deft touch and uncanny court sense to dictate play throughout.
	   Never in the 6-3, 6-4 victory did the Swiss star appear out of
control, off balance or rushed.
	   Williams, for her part, hurt herself with 38 unforced errors.
	   ``I don't think I was as patient as I should have been. I guess
everyone knows I like to hit,'' Williams said. ``I suppose I got a
little too excited, really wanted to hit a winner.''
	   Hingis came into the match with a 5-2 career record against the
eighth-seeded Williams, but the two 17-year-olds were 2-2 this
year.
	   The match promised to be an intriguing battle between power and
smarts. Despite her far greater experience, Hingis actually is
three and a half months younger than Williams.
	   But, just as in their only previous Grand Slam encounter, a 6-0,
6-4 win by Hingis in the U.S. Open final last summer, the match
turned into a one-sided affair.
	   ``It's probably good for me to lose so I can really see what I'm
doing wrong and really look at myself and say, `Venus, you're not
there,''' she said.
	   Moya, seeded 12th here, is ranked 12th in the world but has been
as high as fifth. He's hoping to crack back into the top 10 this
week.
	   He became the talk of the tennis world at last year's Australian
Open _ for both his dashing good looks and his talent. He upset
defending champion Boris Becker in the first round, then went
straight through to the final, where he lost to Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old Moya had never
gone past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And here at
Roland Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two
previous visits.
	   Moya was at the top of his all-court game Tuesday.
	   A crucial moment came in the fourth set at 4-4, 15-15. Rios was
serving. Moya, leading two sets to one, hit a shot and Rios let it
go, thinking the ball had bounced twice on Moya's side. But the
referee said it hadn't.
	   Rios lost the point, the game, and his concentration.
	   ``Maybe if I won that game, the match would have been
different,'' he said later.
	   Now Moya is the highest seed left in the tournament, and one of
only three seeds left _ all Spaniards, who excel on clay. The
others are the No. 14 seed, Alex Corretja, and the No. 15 seed,
Felix Mantilla, whom Moya faces in the semis Friday.
	   Mantilla and Moya are buddies. ``We're going to be friends until
Friday,'' he said.
	   ``When we get to the court, I will try to kill him.''
	   The day's action ended on a sour note when Gustavo Kuerten, the
defending champion who lost in the second round, was disqualified
in doubles for throwing his racket at the chair umpire _ hitting a
fan in the stands, but apparently not causing injury.
	   Kuerten, who won last year as an unseeded player, is well liked
by fans, players and the media. In fact, he won this year's Orange
Prize, voted by French tennis writers for the player they like
best.
	   There's also a Lemon Prize, for the player they like least. The
winner, two years running, has been Rios.

Fleeing ethnic Albanians describe destruction from Serb offensive

	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Shock etched on their faces, ethnic
Albanian refugees joining the growing exodus from Kosovo province
described destruction and violence from a major Serb offensive
against separatists that has sparked concern among Western powers.
	   The accounts of weeping refugees provided some of the most
detailed information yet about the stepped-up campaign launched in
late May by Serb police and army forces, who are trying to crush
the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers after
years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the
secessionist southern province, where ethnic Albanians represent 90
percent of the population of 2.2 million.
	   Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees fleeing
to neighboring Albania described artillery bombardments that forced
out entire villages and house-burnings they said were clearly
intended to drive them out.
	   There have been no reports like those in Bosnia of massive
civilian roundups or massacres in the Kosovo campaign, which the
Serbs insist targets guerrillas.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted increasing comparisons to the
ethnic war in Bosnia and its atrocities. More than 200 people have
been killed in the province in the past three months.
	   The growing violence has sparked alarm among Western powers that
the fighting could spill over into neighboring Balkan nations.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton told a visiting delegation of ethnic
Albanians in Washington last week that the United States ``shall
not tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo.''
	   But the West repeatedly has failed to get Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and has
yet to devise a strategy for how to resolve the worsening conflict.
	   A NATO official in Brussels, Belgium, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance was ``preoccupied'' with Kosovo and
would debate what to do at a NATO Council meeting Wednesday.
	   Those concerns prompted NATO last week to consider possible
troop deployments in Albania and Macedonia. But Russia said Tuesday
that NATO cannot post troops in Albania without the approval of the
United Nations.
	   Russia ``opposes any decisions leading to the use of external
forces interfering in those problems,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin said. Russia has maintained that Kosovo is an
internal matter for Serbia.
	   Based on information from the refugees and ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo, the latest campaign is concentrated in the
western region of Decani, where the Serbs deployed thousands of
additional paramilitary forces and are pulverizing 10 towns and
villages with artillery.
	   The town of Decani, with a population of about 20,000, was in
ruins with no sign of life, according to the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center. Dead cattle littered the streets, the center
said.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army controls as much as a third of
the province, several refugees said they saw no sign of it in the
sealed-off area under siege by Serb forces.
	   ``When the shelling started we ran to the woods, waiting for it
to stop,'' said Nise Mazrekaj, 27, from the targeted village of
Slup. ``But then the Serbs set the houses on fire, so we couldn't
go back.''
	   Her three young children were crying and hungry after an
overnight mountain journey over goats' paths. Other refugees were
stretched out on the grass asleep, exhausted from their trip.
	   ``There's no way back, no,'' said Mazrekaj's husband, Sulejman,
39, distraught from the shelling a day earlier.
	   The Serb attacks appeared to have intensified over the weekend,
judging by the stream of refugees that began Sunday morning to
Albania. U.N. officials said 1,600 refugees had registered, but
local Albanian officials said about 5,000 refugees had arrived,
many refusing to register.
	   ``The people keep coming,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for
the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva.
	   Communications with western Kosovo remained cut off.
	   A monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe who spoke on condition of anonymity said military action in
the area around the border appeared to have declined.
	   Serb authorities said militants fighting for independence had
attacked police along a road in western Kosovo, killing one
officer.
	   The authorities also said they had broadcast radio appeals for
residents of Decani and several villages to return. The residents
were told their safety would be guaranteed as long as they didn't
participate in ``terrorist activities.''
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders publicly acknowledged the existence of
the Kosovo Liberation Army for the first time Tuesday, noting that
the ``massive Serb aggression is meeting heavy resistance'' from
the people and the KLA.
	   Adem Demaqi, a prominent ethnic Albanian leader known as
Kosovo's Nelson Mandela for the years he spent in Serbian prisons,
appealed to the KLA to refrain from targeting innocent Serb
civilians in retaliation for police brutality.

Danube dam project a monument to mismanagement, indecision

<TEXT>
	   DUNAKILITI, Hungary (AP) _ The Dunakiliti dam towers over the
Danube River on the Hungarian-Slovak border, but the huge structure
sits dormant, and the water flow underneath is down to a trickle.
	   It is a stark monument to political and environmental
misjudgments that have produced one of Europe's longest-running
environmental disputes.
	   But despite Hungary's agreement to reconsider dropping out of a
joint project to build a series of dams, the deal's future is as
shaky as its checkered past.
	   Finishing the originally envisioned project would cost the two
eastern European countries hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   Critics, including economists and environmental activists who
have sponsored several protests against the project, say it makes
no sense _ even if it were free.
	   ``Hungary simply does not need the electricity this project
would generate,'' said Laszlo Zsolnai, an economics professor at
Budapest University.
	   Need for the hydroelectric dams seemed clear when the idea was
born more than two decades ago.
	   Czechoslovakia and Hungary, then-communist neighbors, agreed in
1977 to build a system of dams on the Danube to produce more
electricity and improve the river's commercial navigation by
raising the water level.
	   But with construction well under way, progress on the Dunakiliti
dam was slowed when environmentalist opponents successfully tied
their fight to the rising opposition to Hungary's communist regime.
	   After communism collapsed throughout the region, Hungary
withdrew from the project, citing its potential dangers to the
environment.
	   Washed away were dlrs 1 billion spent for planning, construction
and subsequent demolition of foundations for a dam at Nagymaros on
the scenic Danube bend 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Budapest.
	   The dormant Dunakiliti dam, 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream,
cost an additional dlrs 700 million in 1997 dollars, said Istvan
Majer, head of Hungary's government-run Danube Program Bureau.
	   Hungarian environmentalists celebrated, but it was a hollow
victory.
	   After Hungary's pullout, Slovakia built a substitute dam at
Cunovo on Slovak territory, six miles 10 kilometers upstream from
Dunakiliti.
	   On Oct. 22, 1992, just over two months before its formal break
from the Czech Republic, Slovakia shocked Hungarians by diverting
the Danube along a 10-mile (15-kilometer) stretch, rerouting most
of the river to feed a huge canal.
	   Hungary's pullout and Slovakia's diversion, which has sharply
reduced the water flow in the old riverbed, led both sides to turn
to the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   The court ruled against both, saying Hungary broke international
law by bowing out of the dam project and Slovakia acted illegally
by diverting the river.
	   Last September, the two sides agreed to resolve the dispute
within six months. But with that self-imposed deadline well past,
no new pact seems imminent.
	   Slovakia may go back to the World Court because Hungary, while
initialing a framework agreement in February to restart the dam
project, said it needs until year's end to conduct more feasibility
studies.
	   If a new contract is signed, one of the huge new expenditures
Hungary will face is construction of a new dam at Pilismarot, just
north of Nagymaros.
	   One reason Hungary's outgoing government was considering
resuming the project is Slovakia's experience with its own Danube
dam. The view of the new coalition government taking office is
still unclear.
	   The Slovak canal destroyed 40 square kilometers (16 square
miles) of wetlands and about 60 square kilometers (23 square miles)
of other land were taken for a storage reservoir.
	   Environmentalists had warned of far direr consequences for the
environment, such as pollution of water supplies and far-reaching
ecological damage.
	   ``The worst didn't happen _ the predicted drying up of the
wetland forest and the deterioration of the drinking water,'' said
Slovak geologist Lajos Tuba.
	   Tuba acknowledged that because of changed water levels, nature
is having to adjust to new conditions and plant life is changing.
	   About 60,000 Hungarians live in 19 villages and small towns in
the affected Szigetkoes area along the Danube and many want all of
the proposed dam system completed, including a large storage lake
at their doorstep.
	   Maria Tamas, who heads the regional government, said completion
``would be the foundation for further development of the region in
agriculture, infrastructure and tourism.''

Philips to set up operation in Sydney 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International electronics giant Philips
will invest U.S. dlrs 10 million (16 million Australian dollars) in
the next five years to set up operations in Sydney.
	   Premier Bob Carr said Philips will build its worldwide
competence center for traffic management systems at Moorebank in
the city's west.
	   It will create more than 80 direct and 300 indirect jobs, he
said.
	   ``Philips chose Sydney ahead of potential sites in Europe, North
America and Asia because of its proximity to the Asia-Pacific
market, and the traffic management expertise of its local
workforce,'' he said in a statement.
	   The company will build research and development facilities, and
manufacture high-tech traffic management systems for local and
international markets, he said.
	   Philips' Asia Pacific chairman and president, Peter van der Wal,
said the operation was an important step in the company's aim to
become the leading international supplier of intelligent transport
systems.

Indonesia's new leader unconcerned about past corruption 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ New President B.J. Habibie has urged
Indonesians not to dwell on the country's corrupt past under former
leader Suharto, but to look forward to a promising future based on
economic recovery and political reform.
	   In a CNN interview broadcast Wednesday, Habibie did not
specifically address allegations of corruption leveled against
Suharto, concerns about Habibie's own extensive business interests,
or accusations of abuses by the military.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop? Five years ago, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years?''
he asked. ``The future is almost unlimited. ... So I think it is
not worthwhile to dip into the past. I have to look to the future
and create a better life...for the people.''
	   During the 30-minute interview, the first broadcast since
Habibie was sworn in on May 21, he said his ``main mission'' as
president is to fix Indonesia's ailing economy and to improve its
democracy in the shortest amount of time possible. He said he wants
to restore the self-confidence of Indonesians.
	   Habibie, who took power when Suharto resigned following riots
and protests last month, declined to say whether he would run for
re-election after parliamentary elections are held next year.
	   He said most of Indonesia's 202 million people are suffering
badly from an inflation rate of more than 50 percent and soaring
unemployment. He said that many don't care who is the president but
instead worry about ``their rice bowls, their homes, to live in
peace, the future for their children.''
	   Habibie, a civilian and Suharto's friend and former deputy, said
he was confident the powerful military, which played a key role in
Suharto's departure during the unrest, would maintain its support
for him as it ``always follows the constitution.''
	   Critics have accused Suharto of allowing his family to amass
fortunes and building massive business empires through nepotism and
corruption during his 32 years in power.
	   The government this week launched an broad probe into state
corruption, but many want a specific investigation into Suharto's
wealth, estimated at between dlrs 20 billion and 40 billion.
	   Some want that money to be taken back by the state so it can use
it to help fix the country's worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Habibie, 61, has known Suharto since boyhood and was a Suharto
Cabinet minister for 20 years. Despite this close links to the old
government, Habibie said he had no problems bringing in reforms.
	   Already he has promised the election and freed some political
prisoners.
	   He likened his newfound role as a reformer to that of leaders
Boris Yeltsin in Russia and Zhu Rongji of China who brought
sweeping reforms to their countries despite being part of old
authoritarian regimes.
	   Habibie said he had no option but to reform Indonesia's battered
economy while introducing sweeping political change, saying both
were interlinked.
	   ``My role here is to bring in the shortest time possible the
economy back and to improve the democracy,'' he said, adding that
change must be made in accordance with the constitution.
	   He estimated that the current Parliament will have drafted new
electoral laws by August and that these would be enacted four
months later. He said a new session of the People's Consultative
Assembly, made up of lawmakers and government appointees, would
then set a date for the election. After the ballot, the assembly
could then choose a new president.
	   At least 500 people and thousands of buildings and homes were
damaged during riots in May. But despite simmering discontent over
the economic crisis, Habibie played down the possibility of further
violence on the streets.
	   He said Indonesians wanted reform but not on the basis of
``destroying everything they have built in 30 years.''
	   He described the International Monetary Fund, which is now
revamping a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout package for Indonesia,
as playing an important and supportive role.
	   He also praised a team of economic ministers in his Cabinet,
saying: ``They are the best sons and daughters of the country.''
	   One issue that Habibie indicated would change was the fate of
East Timor, the former Portuguese territory invaded by Suharto
troops in 1975 and annexed a year later. Habibie said East Timor
must remain an integral part of Indonesia.

Dollar edges lower, stocks fall in Tokyo trading 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday currency, stock and bond prices
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen
Wednesday morning amid speculation about possible intervention by
world central bankers to prop up the Japanese currency. Tokyo
stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 138.74 yen as of midday, down 0.51 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 138.83
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 222.68 points,
or 1.43 percent, to 15,331.77 at the close of the morning session.
On Tuesday, the index gained 233.42 points, or 1.52 percent.
	   The dollar slipped as traders speculated that the Group of Seven
major industrialized nations will jointly intervene to help boost
the sliding yen.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stoked speculation about
joint intervention when he confirmed that there will be a G-7
meeting ``sometime early next week.''
	   Rubin also prompted traders to sell dollars when he told
reporters that Washington shares Tokyo's concern over the yen's
weakness.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stock prices fell amid profit
taking. Investors were also discouraged by an overnight fall on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 31.13
points, or 0.35 percent, to 8,891.24.
	   Toshiba was among the decliners. The electronics maker fell
after the Nihon Keizai financial daily reported Wednesday that
large amounts of toxic chemicals were detected in ground water
under a Toshiba factory in the city of Nagoya. Toshiba denied using
the chemical at that site.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 8.49 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,204.48.
The TOPIX rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent on Tuesday.
	   The benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.130 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish. Its price
edged lower to 112.58 yen from 112.59 yen.

Dodgers no longer pursuing Randy Johnson AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Randy Johnson is not coming to Los Angeles,
at least right now.
	   Dodgers general manager Fred Claire told reporters before
Tuesday night's game against the St. Louis Cardinals that the team
is no longer talking with the Seattle Mariners about acquiring
left-hander Randy Johnson.
	   ``This team is no longer in pursuit of Randy Johnson,'' Claire
said firmly. ``It ended at 12 noon today, from our standpoint.''
	   Shortly after Claire's announcement, Seattle president Chuck
Armstrong issued a statement saying the Mariners won't trade
Johnson this season.
	   ``Randy Johnson is a valued pitcher for the Mariners who is
under contract for the balance of the 1998 season,'' Armstrong
said. ``Randy will pitch for the Mariners throughout this season.
Accordingly, we have no plans to trade Randy Johnson.''
	   Claire didn't totally close the door, but said the only trade he
would now pursue was one involving right-hander Hideo Nomo, whom
the Dodgers designated for assignment on Monday.
	   ``I would hope we should be able to move quickly,'' Claire said.
``Clearly, the sooner the better for Hideo.''
	   Claire said the Dodgers made a trade proposal to the Mariners
``before noon Monday,'' and gave Seattle general manager Woody
Woodward 24 hours to respond.
	   When noon came and went Tuesday, Claire said he faxed Woodward a
letter saying the proposal was being taken off the table, but to
contact him by 4 p.m. if he had any thoughts.
	   Claire heard nothing, and then held a team meeting around 5:45
p.m. to tell them there would be no deal for Johnson, that he had
confidence in them and it was time to move on.
	   In that deal, catcher Mike Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile
went to the Marlins for outfielders Gary Sheffield and Jim
Eisenreich, third baseman Bobby Bonilla, catcher Charles Johnson
and a minor league pitcher.
	   The Dodgers have until June 11 to trade Nomo, send him to the
minor leagues or release him.
	   Nomo, 29, could opt to become a free agent if assigned to the
minors as a fourth-year big-leaguer. If he does, he would forfeit
the remainder of his 1998 salary from the Dodgers.

Sabres down Capitals to avoid elimination 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Dominik Hasek made 34 saves, survived numerous
deflections, a disallowed goal and another that was not allowed
after a video review as the the Buffalo Sabres beat the Washington
Capitals 2-1 to close the best-of-7 Eastern Conference finals to
3-2 and force a Game 6 Thursday night in Buffalo.
	   Buffalo is attempting to become the first National Hockey League
team to overcome a 3-1 series deficit to win a conference finals.
	   The Sabres were outshot 35-16 as the Capitals controlled the
game with vicious forechecking, but Buffalo's shot No. 14 _ a
superb individual effort by former Caps defenseman Jason Woolley _
found the net with 4:26 remaining. It was only the second
third-period goal the Sabres have scored all series.
	   With the Capitals on a line change, Woolley started at his own
blue line and skated untouched between the Washington defenseman
and put the puck between goaltender Olaf Kolzig's legs. The shot
silenced the MCI Center's boisterous sellout crowd, which was
hoping to witness the biggest victory in the history of the
Capitals franchise.
	   But the game belonged to Hasek, who put the words ``Swiss
cheese'' on his shirt after allowing a soft goal in Saturday's 2-0
loss in Game 4. Among his heroic moments Tuesday: He pinned the
puck against the right post to stop Adam Oates with 10:49 to play _
a no-goal verified by the replay official _ and snatched Richard
Zednik's attempt out of mid-air with 7:55 left.
	   Then there was Bondra, who had a chance to give the Caps the
lead with 12:30 to play on his second short-handed breakaway of the
night, but he keep the puck low _ where Hasek is at his best _ and
the goalie stopped the shot with his right pad.
	   The save came shortly after Hasek was knocked to the ice in a
collision with Brian Bellows. Hasek lay on the ice for about a
minute before play resumed.
	   The Sabres played 6:30 before taking their first shot of the
game, but they scored on their second one just three seconds later
on defenseman Darryl Shannon's slapshot from beyond the right
circle. Kolzig, screened on the play, barely moved a muscle as the
puck went between his legs.
	   It was Shannon's second goal of the playoffs, one less than he
had during the regular season.
	   Oates appeared to get the Caps on the board two minutes later
when he doggedly stuffed the puck over Hasek's leg on a wraparound,
but referee Terry Gregson's whistle had blown the play dead.
	   The tying goal that counted came at the 16:29 mark on Andrei
Nikolishin's first career playoff score, a close-range one-timer on
a power play. All four Buffalo penalty-killers were caught on the
same side of the ice, leaving Nikolishin alone as he received an
apparently deflected pass from Zednik.

Australian economy growing despite Asian crisis 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's economy surprised
analysts by steaming ahead in the first three months of 1998 at an
annual growth rate of almost 5 percent despite the crisis in Asia.
	   The latest snapshot of the economy released Wednesday by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed gross domestic product
rising by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent in the quarter ended
March, for annual growth of 4.9 percent.
	   Economists had been divided about the effects of Asia's economic
meltdown on Australia's growth, with some expecting signs of an
economic slowdown to appear in Wednesday's figures while others
predicted a final burst of growth ahead of a more dramatic slowing
later this year.
	   The average expectation was for a 0.5 percent increase in the
quarter, with predictions ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 percent.
	   In the previous quarter, Australia's gross domestic product
expanded at a revised rate of 0.7 percent, or an annual growth rate
of 3.8 percent.

Andreu wins Lancaster Invitational road race 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LANCASTER, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Veteran U.S. professional cyclist
Frankie Andreu sprinted away from two other riders with a little
over a mile (two kilometers) to go Tuesday and won the 91-mile (146
kilometers) Lancaster Invitational road race, the first event in
the First Union Cycling series.
	   The U.S. Postal Cycling Team rider made his winning move in the
last lap of the 13-lap event, getting the edge on breakaway
teammate Lance Armstrong and Cezary Zemana of Poland.
	   ``I just had to attack. It was decided earlier in the race that
if I had a chance, I would go for the win,'' Andreu said.
	   Andreu, 31, and Zemana, 30, initiated a key breakaway about 63
miles (101 kilometers) into the race, building a gap from six
riders who were off the front but were being caught by a chase
group of 10 riders.
	   The group of three then built a steady lead of up to one minute
and four seconds over the field that was quickly breaking into
smaller groups.
	   A field of 143 riders started the race with 43 finishing. The
race, part of the Tour of America, had a total purse of dlrs
15,500, with dlrs 2,500 going to first place.
	   The series, which concludes Sunday with the U.S. Pro
Championship in Philadelphia, goes to Wilmington, Delaware, on
Wednesday, then to Trenton, New Jersey, on Thursday.
	   Armstrong, 26, of the United States, said he was glad to see
Andreu win.
	   ``You don't see him win very much. It was gratifying for me,''
said Armstrong, who is continuing his return to competition after
being diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 1996.
	   Andreu's victory was his first in the United States since 1995,
when he won a stage of the West Virginia Kmart Classic. In Europe,
he won a stage of the Mount Bretagne race.
	   ``I'm putting more emphasis on U.S. races this year and want to
prove myself in America,'' Andreu said.

International Development Bank promoting fight against violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The International Development
Bank is urging Latin American leaders to fervently fight the
violence plaguing much of the region in order to strengthen their
economies.
	   ``Violence is not a biblical curse,'' bank president Enrique
Iglesias said at the start of a meeting on public security.
``Violence is not only repugnant to all civilized society but an
excess that cannot be permitted in Latin America.''
	   Bank experts estimate that violence costs Latin America nations
at least dlrs 15 billion annually.
	   In 1996, there were 140,000 homicides in Latin America, a rate
of 30 deaths for every 100,000 people which is the highest for any
region in the world, Iglesias said.
	   ``We are in the presence of a special theme that has major
social, political and economic repercussions,'' he said.
	   A recent study by the University of Central America showed that
in 1995, violence cost El Salvador dlrs 777 million _ or 13 percent
of the gross national product.
	   El Salvador's President Armando Calderon said Monday that the
country's crime problem has been one of the major headaches of his
administration.
	   El Salvador suffers a homicide rate of more than 100 killings
per 100,000 citizens. Colombia, long considered the most violent
nations in Latin America, had a homicide rate of 81 per 100,000 in
1996, the latest figures available.
	   The International Development Bank already has extended credit
to Colombia and Uruguay to help fight violence.
	   ``We are proud to serve not only as a credit agency but as a
source of social promotion, Iglesias said. ``In the last few years
we have dedicated more than half of our resources to fight poverty
and the social problems that stem from it.''
	   More than 500 regional leaders and international experts are
attending the session, including representatives from across the
Americas and Europe.

Martinez ties Marichal as winningest Latin pitcher as Braves beat Brewers 9-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Dennis Martinez tied Juan Marichal as the
winningest Latin American pitcher in baseball history Tuesday
night, scattering 12 hits in a shutout as the Atlanta Braves
defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 9-0.
	   Andres Galarraga homered twice and Andruw Jones homered and hit
two triples for Atlanta.
	   With both teams wearing baggy replica uniforms from the 1950s,
the 43-year-old Martinez (2-2) got his 243rd victory by going the
distance for the first time since May 26, 1996. The right-hander
walked one and struck out three in his 30th career shutout and
122nd complete game.
	   On two occasions earlier this season, Martinez, who is from
Nicaragua, was within a few outs of tying Marichal's mark only to
have the Braves' bullpen blow victories. He wasn't going to come
out of this one, however, even when the Brewers got a runner to
third in the ninth.
	   After getting pinch-hitter Bobby Hughes to ground to short for
the final out, Martinez shared hugs and handshakes with teammates.
	   In a 22-year career with Baltimore, Montreal, Cleveland, Seattle
and Atlanta, Martinez has a 243-189 record. The four-time All-Star
pitched a perfect game for the Expos in 1991 against Los Angeles.
	   Marichal, a native of the Dominican Republic, posted a 243-142
record in 16 seasons from 1960-1975, winning 238 games during 14
years with San Francisco.
	   Paul Wagner (1-4) took the loss.
  Expos 4, Phillies 3  
	   In Philadelphia, Carl Pavano pitched 7 1-3 strong innings to get
his first major-league win as Montreal snapped a three-game losing
streak.
	   Pavano (1-0), a highly-touted right-hander obtained by Montreal
in the trade that sent Pedro Martinez to Boston in November,
allowed three runs and four hits in only his third major-league
start.
	   The Phillies stranded the tying run on third in the ninth when
Ugueth Urbina got Alex Arias to hit a foul pop to first baseman
Brad Fullmer. Urbina pitched the ninth for his 13th save as the
Expos won for only the seventh time in 20 road games.
	   Despite pitching his fifth complete game of the season, Curt
Schilling (5-6) lost his third straight decision.
  Pirates 5, Mets 2  
	   In Pittsburgh, Kevin Young hit a tiebreaking three-run triple to
finally make Chris Peters a winner over the Mets, and Pittsburgh
overcame an evening of violent weather to beat New York.
	   The Pirates have won a season-high four straight.
	   Peters (1-3) allowed two runs on four hits over five innings to
end a career-long five-game losing streak against the Mets.
	   Brian Bohanon (2-2) took the loss, surrendering four runs on
five hits over three innings after starter Masato Yoshii didn't
return following a 58-minute rain delay.
	   The storm was accompanied by brilliant lightning and funnel
clouds that approached the stadium, only to veer away. Before the
game, another funnel cloud touched down on Mount Washington
overlooking the stadium, ripping the roofs off about a dozen houses
and dropping hail and rain on the stadium.
  Cubs 2, Marlins 1  
	   In Chicago, pinch-hitter Jason Hardtke singled home the winning
run in the ninth as Florida dropped its seventh straight.
	   Mickey Morandini reached on an infield single off Felix Heredia
(0-3) with one out and advanced on a balk. Sammy Sosa then hit a
ball between Heredia's legs for an infield hit, and Mark Grace was
walked intentionally to load the bases.
	   Jay Powell relieved and Hardtke, batting for Terrell Lowery, hit
a soft fly ball into the gap in left center, giving Chicago its
fifth consecutive victory.
	   Terry Adams (4-3) pitched one hitless inning.
