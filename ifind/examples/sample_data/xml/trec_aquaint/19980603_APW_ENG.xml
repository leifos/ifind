Survey: Nearly one in every two Japanese men admit buying sex 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A survey of Japanese men released Wednesday found
that nearly one in every two admitted to having paid prostitutes
for sex at least once.
	   The findings were made in a survey of about 2,500 adult males
across Japan between August and October of last year that was
conducted by the Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center, a civic group
handling women's issues.
	   Of the 2,500 respondents, 46.2 percent said they have paid for
sex, while 51.3 percent said they have never done so.
	   ``It shows they (Japanese men) are very nonchalant about paying
for sex, as thought,'' said Yukiko Tsunoda, a lawyer for the group.
	   Like other Japanese polls, the survey provided no margin of
error. And Tsunoda cautioned that the men surveyed included
acquaintances of group members and were not picked entirely at
random.
	   As many as 61.1 percent of those who said they had paid for sex
also said they think it desirable to have a society without
prostitution, the survey showed.
	   Prostitution was officially banned in 1956, but the sex industry
remains prosperous at loosely disguised ``soup land'' brothels.
	   Japan has come under international criticism as a growing number
of Southeast Asian women complain of having been lured to Japan
with promises of jobs only to be forced into prostitution by the
``yakuza,'' Japan's mob.

Toxins found in ground water near Toshiba plant 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Local environmental agency officials have found
high concentrations of a toxic chemical in water under a Toshiba
Corp. plant in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, a spokesman for
the city's Environment Protection Agency said on Wednesday.
	   Ground water under the factory contained 470 milligrams per
liter of trichloroethylene, or TCE, 15,670 times the level the
environmental agency considers safe, according to the agency
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   TCE causes cancer in laboratory animals, and studies indicate it
may be the cause of lupus erythematosus and other connective-tissue
and immune-system diseases.
	   The city does not use ground water for drinking water, the
official said. Nonetheless, the city will offer physical
examinations to residents who request them from August.
	   Environmental officials in Nagoya are so far not blaming Toshiba
for the contamination, saying they are still investigating the
source and extent of the spill. They have questioned 13 businesses
in the area and found that a nearby metal-products factory used TCE
from 1988 to 1990.
	   According to the agency official, the factory said it properly
disposed of the TCE it used.
	   For its part, Toshiba claims it has not used TCE in the area in
the last 15 years, according to company spokesman Keisuke Ohmori.
Ohmori said the company ``suspects it came from other facilities.''
	   Toshiba's plant in Nagoya, 269 kilometers (168 miles) west of
Tokyo, makes home appliances.
	   In a previous incident, a former Toshiba plating factory that
had been located nearby was blamed as the source of toxic
substances including TCE found there in October.
	   The environmental official said his agency did not believe the
plating factory was also the source of the newly discovered
contamination because it was some 350 meters (yards) away and
ground water between the areas was not polluted.
	   Toshiba said it is working with Nagoya city to investigate the
contamination.

Militant South Korean labor group to go ahead with strike plans 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant labor group said Wednesday
it will go ahead with plans for a nationwide strike next week,
citing a breakdown in talks with the government aimed at halting
growing layoffs.
	   The decision by the maverick Confederation of Korean Trade
Unions raised concern that labor unrest may persist in South Korea
in the midst of its deepening economic crisis.
	   It also chilled President Kim Dae-jung's hopes of attracting
foreign investment during his visit to the United States next week.
Kim has stressed the importance of labor peace to his efforts.
	   ``The government is too much uncompromising, especially on
layoffs,'' said Chung Sung-hee, a spokesman of the confederation,
which claims a membership of 500,000 in car, shipbuilding and other
heavy industries.
	   Chung said overnight talks with the government to avert the
strike broke down because of what he called the government's
unwillingness to accept the confederation's demand for a halt to
widespread layoffs.
	   He said the strike, the second in two weeks, will begin on June
10 as scheduled, joined by 130,000 car workers, shipbuilders and
office clerks from state-run companies. The group organized a
similar two-day strike last week.
	   Government figures show that the number of jobless people has
doubled to nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the
end of the year.
	   Chung said his confederation also will stay out of a
government-sponsored committee that was to begin meeting later
Wednesday to discuss layoffs and other labor problems. Its 15
members were drawn from labor, management and government.
	   A similar committee, formed in January, agreed to make South
Korea's rigid labor markets more flexible. That subsequently led to
the adoption of a law that makes layoffs easier.
	   The new committee is supposed to follow up on what was agreed on
in January and adopt additional measures, including how to speed up
a restructuring of bloated, family-oriented Korean conglomerates,
or chaebol.
	   In accepting a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund in December, South Korea agreed to liberalize its
labor market and force the restructuring of the chaebol to make
them more competitive.
	   The new committee includes delegates from the Korean Federation
of Trade Unions, a pro-government group that has generally avoided
labor strife.
	   The government regretted the confederation's decision to stay
out of the committee but said it was optimistic that the group
would eventually change its position.
	   ``From now on, our efforts will be directed at creating and
systemizing a South Korean model of a social contract to overcome
our national crisis through harmony and compromise,'' said Kim
Won-ki, who heads the committee.

Long-awaited audit says Guyana election was fair and president. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES with comments from opposition leader
By BERT WILKINSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In a blow to Guyana's main opposition
party, a Caribbean Community audit team declared fair December
elections that touched off race riots in the South American
country.
	   Former President Desmond Hoyte said Tuesday he accepted the
results of the audit released that day, but added that that did not
mean his party would accept Chicago-born Janet Jagan as president
of Guyana.
	   Hours after the audit was released Tuesday, Hoyte still claimed
there was fraud.
	   Audited results varied ``only marginally'' from official results
of the Dec. 15 election, which was won by Jagan's People's
Progressive Party, Caribbean Community team leader Ulric Cross
said.
	   Hoyte said, ``If the integrity of the boxes was compromised, as
the People's National Congress contends, a recount of the votes
would reflect the same number of votes that would have been
irregularly put in the box.''
	   Hoyte said his party was not sure they would take up their 24
seats in the 65-member Parliament. But he also called for the
government to speed up constitutional reforms _ a move that
requires a two-thirds majority of votes that would have to include
the opposition.
	   Jagan's party won the parliamentary elections by 60,000 votes, a
margin of about 14 percent over Hoyte's.
	   In an address to the nation, Jagan said it was time for Guyana's
733,000 people to ``move on'' knowing their leaders were fairly
elected.
	   ``This is not the time for victors and losers,'' she said.
	   Race is at the root of most conflicts in Guyana, a former
British colony. Jagan's party is backed by the majority population
of East Indian descent, while Hoyte's draws support from the 40
percent of people of African descent.
	   The audit was part of a peace agreement brokered by the
Caribbean Community on Jan. 17. The deal also calls for new
elections by 2000 and constitutional reform to help balance power
between the ethnic groups.
	   Dozens were hurt in race riots in December and January that
closed down schools and businesses.
	   Fearing more vandalism, some merchants in downtown Georgetown
boarded up their shop windows Tuesday. But no trouble was reported.
	   Hoyte's party governed for 28 years until 1992, through
elections that were largely fraudulent. Independence leader Cheddi
Jagan won the first democratic elections but died in office a year
ago. His widow, 77-year-old Janet Jagan, vowed to continue his
legacy.

World Bank postpones two more loans for India 
</HEADLINE>
RECAPS pvs.
By HARRY DUNPHY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank has postponed two more loans to
India, bringing to more than dlrs 1 billion the amount held up
because of the South Asian nation's nuclear tests.
	   Tuesday's step by the bank's executive directors postponed dlrs
206.4 million in loans. Last week, the bank delayed four loans
totalling dlrs 865 million after the United States, Japan and
Canada urged no action on the money.
	   The loans _ dlrs 130 million for an agriculture project and dlrs
76.4 million for a health care project _ were scheduled to be
discussed by the bank's executive board Tuesday.
	   But ``in response to requests from several executive directors,
consideration of the loans has been postponed to a date to be
determined,'' a World Bank official said.
	   Officials familiar with bank operations say that once loans get
postponed, it can take several months and perhaps longer for them
to be reconsidered.
	   The moves followed India's nuclear tests last month, which drew
bilateral economic sanctions from the United States and other
industrial countries.
	   Under the sanctions, U.S. officials were required to vote
against Indian loans but didn't have the votes for a veto. If they
choose, they can try to gather other countries' support for
disapproval.
	   India was scheduled to get roughly dlrs 3 billion in loans from
the World Bank this fiscal year that ends June 30. Some dlrs 1
billion had already been approved before the country's nuclear
tests.
	   The postponements mean India will have to scale back the
projects for which they were intended or try to raise the money
from private banks at a far greater cost.

Vietnam drought called officially over 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's worst drought in a century is
over, thanks to the onset of the delayed rainy season, official
media reported Wednesday.
	   Power cuts, imposed because of falling reservoir water levels at
crucial hydroelectric power plants, have been dropped.
	   The drought caused an estimated dlrs 385 million in damage, the
English-language Vietnam News quoted the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development as saying. Most of the damage was to the
country's two main cash crops, rice and coffee.
	   But storms now are exacting a toll.
	   Five people were killed and two others were injured by lightning
in the Mekong Delta province of Vinh Long in two separate incidents
Sunday and Monday.
	   Two other people were killed by lightning in the Mekong Delta
province of Can Tho on Sunday.
	   A heavy thunderstorm knocked out power to parts of Hanoi on
Tuesday night. Most of the city's traffic lights were still off
Wednesday morning.

BLATIMORE: three hits. Angels 7, Royals 5 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, four beanballs and two bench-clearing
brawls led to 12 ejections in Anaheim's victory over the Royals.
	   Seven players, both managers and three coaches were ejected in
the AL's second ugly incident in recent weeks. A fight between the
New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles on May 19 resulted in five
suspensions.
	   The problems Tuesday night started in the top of the seventh,
when Anaheim's Phil Nevin was hit in the back by Kansas City
pitcher Jim Pittsley. Nevin, who was also hit in his previous
at-bat by Chris Haney, charged the mound and tried to tackle
Pittsley, but the pitcher wrestled Nevin down and appeared to throw
some jabs.
	   Both benches emptied, but apparently no other players threw
punches. Nevin, Pittsley, and Kansas City coaches Rich Dauer and
Jamie Quirk also were ejected.
	   Rich DeLucia hit Kansas City's Dean Palmer with the first pitch
in the bottom of the eighth and was immediately ejected along with
Anaheim manager Terry Collins.
	   Kansas City pitcher Scott Service and Royals manager Tony Muser
were ejected in the top of the ninth after Service hit Darin Erstad
with a pitch.
	   There were four more ejections in the bottom of the ninth
following a bench-clearing brawl that started after Royals leadoff
hitter Jose Offerman was hit by Mike Holtz. Tossed were Mike Holtz,
Anaheim coach Joe Maddon, Angels infielder Frank Bolick and Royals
infielder Felix Martinez.

Thai government to close down 35 overseas offices to save money 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will close or merge at least
35 government offices in 16 foreign countries to save money amid
the continuing economic crisis.
	   The Cabinet approved the closures Tuesday, deeming them
necessary despite previous budget cuts of 683 million baht (dlrs 17
million) in the foreign service this fiscal year.
	   A recent audit of Thailand's 275 overseas offices in 65
countries found they were both too scattered and that there was too
much overlap from the 10 ministries with foreign postings.
	   Representation will be affected in Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Britain, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the
United States.
	   The ministries of finance and agriculture will each be forced to
shut down seven offices, while the Foreign Ministry will suspend
the postings of 73 diplomats and cut short the tours of 140 by one
year.
	   Other affected ministries include education, labor, commerce,
industry and defense. The Civil Servants Commission will close
eight offices abroad and the Public Relations Department four.
	   Representatives of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, which is
mounting a major campaign to bring in badly needed foreign
exchange, will share offices with state-owned Thai Airways
International.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Severe heat claimed another 100 victims,
taking the total number of dead this summer to more than a 1,000,
according to local news agency reports Wednesday.
	   United News of India reported 100 heat-related deaths Tuesday,
most in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh and the
northeastern state of Bihar.
	   Temperatures have ranged from 43 to 50 Celsius (110 to 122
Fahrenheit) across India over the past month, making it the hottest
summer in 50 years.
	   The seasonal monsoon rains have already hit the coast of
southern India, bringing respite. The rains will take another month
and a half to reach the plains of northern India that have been
hardest hit by the heat wave, but pre-monsoon rains are already
having an effect.
	   In the western desert state of Rajasthan, where temperatures
hovered around 48 Celsius (120 Fahrenheit) two weeks ago, the heat
has lessened slightly.

Pollution in Yangtze harming health, power plants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Pollution along China's Yangtze River is harming
the health of residents and clogging a crucial power plant, state
media reported Wednesday.
	   The National environmental Protection Agency and the ministry
overseeing shipping along the river launched a month-long publicity
campaign Tuesday to get boats, businesses and people from treating
the Yangtze like a garbage dump.
	   In reporting the campaign, China Daily described the river, the
world's third longest, as a ``muddy stream plagued with rubbish of
every conceivable kind.'' It called the condition ``deplorable.''
	   Few of the 27 ports along the 6,400-kilometer (3,800-mile) river
have garbage collection or disposal facilities, the newspaper said.
	   Ships alone dump 8,000 tons of garbage, 100 million tons of
sewage and 5,000 tons of waste oil into the Yangtze every year,
China Daily said. It added that factories and tourist restaurants
were also to blame.
	   The health of people living along the river is suffering and the
pollution is affecting the operation of the Gezhouba power plant,
the newspaper said without elaboration.
	   No mention was made about pollution's possible effects on the
Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric project, being
built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
	   When completed 11 years from now, the dam will hold back a
600-kilometer (350-mile)-long reservoir touching on its western end
the heavily industrialized city of Chongqing.
	   Environmentalists have decried the project's lack of sanitation
facilities and fear the reservoir will become little better than a
large, open sewer.

Government criticizes award to jailed journalist 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam on Wednesday criticized the World
Association of Newspapers for giving an award to a jailed
Vietnamese journalist.
	   ``We ... hold that WAN's conferring of the Golden Pen of Freedom
award to Doan Viet Hoat, a prisoner who is serving his sentence, is
a mistake,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   ``(It) absolutely will not enjoy the support of the Vietnamese
public opinion and will affect the prestige of the awarding
organization.''
	   Hoat, serving a 15-year prison term for publishing pro-democracy
newsletters, was honored Monday for his commitment to a free press.
	   He has spent much of the past three decades in re-education
camps and prisons for calling for greater civil rights and
democratic reform in Vietnam. He continues to call for the changes
from his prison cell.
	   The World Association of Newspapers represents 15,000 newspapers
around the world.

Hong Kong focuses on economic woes with high-level meetings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong officials took aim at a worsening
economic and employment picture on Wednesday in a pair of
high-level meetings aimed at finding ways to limit the damage from
a looming recession.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang convened the first government
task force to discuss the labor market, review retraining programs,
and create more government jobs. Unemployment is officially at a
14-year high of 3.9 percent, although unions say the figure is much
higher.
	   It is expected to increase as Hong Kong, which avoided the worst
of Asia's economic crisis for nearly a year, settles into a
protracted battle with low stock and property prices, and
joblessness.
	   The economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and one senior official said late Tuesday that it would
likely shrink in the second quarter, too. That technically would
put Hong Kong in recession.
	   More than 80 people demonstrated outside the government building
where Tsang convened the closed employment meeting, demanding cuts
in taxes and government fees to encourage business and employment,
Hong Kong Radio reported.
	   At the same time, representatives of the seven political parties
that won seats in May 24 legislative elections held a separate
meeting to seek a common stance on improving the economy.
	   The meeting included critics of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa,
who took office after the handover to Chinese rule last July 1,
pro-business parties, and grassroots parties that back Beijing.
	   News reports said proposals on the table would include pushing
ahead government infrastructure projects, tax cuts, lowering public
utilities charges and government fees, and assistance for small and
medium-size businesses that form the backbone of the Hong Kong
economy.
	   The meetings come on the heels of an announcement Tuesday by
Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong
that the territory's economy is likely to slide further.
	   ``If you define a recession as negative growth in two successive
quarters ... it seems we may see it,'' the South China Morning Post
quoted Yam as saying in London, where he is at a symposium for
central bankers. He is the first senior official to suggest that
Hong Kong is heading for recession.
	   ``The second quarter is not particularly good, and if you look
at the second quarter of last year ... the second quarter is also
likely to report negative growth,'' Yam said.
	   Yam said that the contraction of 2 percent in Gross Domestic
Product during the first quarter, the first such contraction in
almost 13 years, was a surprise to Hong Kong officials, though they
had anticipated some sort of slowdown.
	   ``We felt a slowdown would occur, but the slowdown is quite
sharp,'' Yam was quoted as saying. ``The second quarter will be
quite bad ... we will have to wait until the second half of the
year (for a recovery).''

Air current blamed for helicopter crash that killed queen's aide 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An investigation into the crash of a
brand-new helicopter last year that killed 14 people, including the
private secretary of Queen Sirikit, has been blamed an air current
that caused loss of control.
	   The government's Public Relations Department disclosed the air
force investigation results in its weekly news bulletin and noted
that the air force had since revised safety procedures.
	   The report said a down draft created a vacuum that caused the
Super Puma helicopter to lose control and crash Sept. 19 in
southern Thailand after the royal delegation left a development
project.
	   The queen was aboard another helicopter that had taken off
minutes earlier. The accident set off a minor furor in Thailand due
to the danger presented to the revered royal family.
	   Pilots have now been instructed not to fly in low visibility
areas and to take extra precautions when flying at low altitude in
mountainous terrain.

Papua New Guinea agrees to withdraw troops from Bougainville 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Papua New Guinea's
government has agreed to withdraw its troops from central
Bougainville in a show of good faith to rebel fighters on the
Pacific island.
	   Key rebel negotiators had demanded the troops' withdrawal prior
to signing a cease-fire agreement on April 30 to end the 10-year
secessionist conflict.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate said Tuesday night it was the most
significant ``on the ground development'' in the current peace
process.
	   Under the cease-fire agreement, the troops would withdraw from
Bougainville on the condition that a civilian police force was
gradually installed to replace them.
	   Skate said the rebels must also give an assurance that they
would withdraw their fighters from the central island area around
Arawa and not take advantage of the situation.
	   ``As the cease-fire agreement makes quite plain, any decision to
change the status of Arawa would require recognition by all
parties, the government looks forward to receiving the required
assurances without delay,'' Skate said in a statement.
	   He said 35 Bougainvillean cadets had already graduated from
auxiliary police training.
	   Arawa is located near the giant Panguna copper mine majority
owned by Anglo-Australian company Rio Tinto, which is blamed for
triggering the conflict a decade ago. Land owner and royalty
disputes arising from the mine escalated into a full scale war for
independence from Papua New Guinea.
	   Up to 20,000 people are thought to have died on the copper-rich
island, the largest in the Solomon Islands archipelago and 800
miles (1,300 km) northeast of Papua New Guinea's capital, Port
Moresby.
	   Despite the current peace process on the island, the rebels'
political leader, Francis Ona, is opposed to the cease-fire and the
presence of a 300-strong Australian-led peace monitoring group on
the island.
	   Ona is still entrenched in his rebel stronghold at Guava village
near the mine, but his support is estimated to now number only a
few hundred.
	   A leaders' meeting is planned for later this month between the
Papua New Guinea government and the rebels where the critical issue
of independence for Bougainville will be formally addressed for the
first time.

Philippine export growth slows in April 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine export growth slowed in
April, dropping to 10 percent on an annual basis from 24 percent in
March, the government said Wednesday.
	   Previously, the Philippines had been able to avoid the export
growth slowdown that has plagued much of Asia since the currency
crisis struck last July.
	   On a month-to-month basis, exports actually fell 7.3 percent in
April to dlrs 2.29 billion from dlrs 2.47 billion in March, the
National Statistics Office said.
	   Exports in April 1997 totaled dlrs 2.08 billion.
	   Electronics and components continued to dominate Philippine
exports, accounting for 53 percent of total shipments. Garments,
which continue to face stiff competition from other countries with
lower production costs, were next, followed by computer parts.
	   From January to April, the country posted a 20 percent growth in
exports to dlrs 9.10 billion from the year-earlier dlrs 7.59
billion.
	   The United States was the top market for Philippine exports,
purchasing dlrs 780.7 million worth of goods in April and
accounting for 34 percent of total exports.
	   Japan was second, cornering some dlrs 323.6 million worth of
goods, or 14 percent.
	   Imports are announced separately by the government each month.
	   The country's trade deficit narrowed to dlrs 140 million in
March from dlrs 934 million a year earlier, largely because of a
continuing decline in imports.
	   The weaker peso, which has fallen about 32 percent against the
dollar since last July, has made imported goods more expensive.

MILWAUKEE: hitless inning. Diamondbacks 9, Rockies 3 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   At Denver, David Dellucci went 4-for-4 and had three RBIs, and
Matt Williams and Karim Garcia each homered as the Arizona
Diamondbacks drubbed the Colorado Rockies.
	   Brian Anderson (3-6) went six innings, limiting Colorado to
three runs on five hits, including homers by Neifi Perez and Vinny
Castilla. Anderson's win dropped Colorado's record against
left-handed starters to 3-14 this season.
	   Russ Springer pitched two hitless innings and Felix Rodriguez
pitched a hitless ninth as Arizona's relievers combined with
Anderson to hold Colorado without a hit after the third inning.
	   Garcia and Travis Lee each had two RBIs for Arizona.
  Cardinals 7, Dodgers 4  
	   At Los Angeles, Brian Jordan hit a two-out, three-run homer off
reliever Jim Bruske in the eighth inning, giving the St. Louis
Cardinals a victory over the Dodgers.
	   The Cardinals, who snapped a three-game losing streak, played
without slugger Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 27 home
runs.
	   McGwire is expected to sit out the three-game series at Dodger
Stadium because of lower back spasms he suffered Monday night in
San Diego.
	   Willie McGee, pinch hitting for winning pitcher Kent Mercker,
started the winning rally with a one-out single off loser Darren
Dreifort. After Ron Gant struck out, Delino DeShields drew a walk,
prompting Dodgers manager Bill Russell to make a pitching change.
	   Jordan then hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats for his
ninth homer, giving the Cardinals seven straight runs.
  Giants 4, Reds 2  
	   At San Francisco, Darryl Hamilton hit his first homer of the
season and Danny Darwin pitched 6 2-3 strong innings as the Giants
won their fifth straight game.
	   Darwin (5-3) settled down after giving up a two-run homer to
Eddie Taubensee in the first, holding the Reds scoreless on two
hits over the next 5 2-3 innings. He gave up a total of four hits,
struck out three and didn't walk a batter.
	   Robb Nen, the last of four San Francisco pitchers, worked the
ninth for his 15th save in 16 chances. The Giants pulled within 1
1/2 games of first-place San Diego, the closest they've been since
April 8.
  Astros 4, Padres 3  
	   At San Diego, Tony Eusebio hit a two-run single in the seventh
inning when Padres relievers were hurt by walks, and the Houston
Astros rallied to beat San Diego 4-3.
	   Shane Reynolds (6-3) gave up three runs and eight hits in eight
innings. Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his 15th save as he and
Reynolds combined to retire the final 13 batters.
	   Reynolds, 4-0 in his last five starts, has allowed only nine
earned runs in 38 2-3 innings.
	   Trailing 3-1 in the seventh, Padres reliever Carlos Reyes (2-2)
loaded the bases on a single and two walks. Brian Boehringer came
on and struck out Tim Bogar before walking Carl Everett to force in
a run.

New uranium mine edges closer to construction 
</HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The opening of Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the
latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the
development.
	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said it expects to begin
digging at the remote Jabiluka mining lease in the Northern
Territory this month, after the territorial government on Tuesday
signed authorizations allowing work to begin on the mine's entrance
and shaft.
	   But the company may be left with nothing but a hole in the
ground, as it goes ahead without having formal approvals to either
build a processing plant or to truck ore to an established mill at
its nearby Ranger mine.
	   ERA has been forced to consider building a second mill just 13
miles (22 km) from Ranger by Aboriginal landowners' refusal to
accept its preferred option, to transport the ore.
	   The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine, claiming it
will cause environmental and indirect cultural damage. But they are
bound by a 1983 contract approving the mill-on-site option.
	   Representatives of the Mirrar Aboriginal clan said Wednesday
they will seek a court order blocking the territorial government's
approval until an environmental approval process for the on-site
mill plan is completed.
	   ``We believe the minister cannot make a thorough decision
without considering the environmental assessment for the milling
option,'' spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio. A similar injunction was last week lifted by the
territory's Supreme Court.
	   Philip Shirvington, chief executive of ERA, a subsidiary of
North Ltd., said there was only a ``small risk'' the company will
not receive the remaining environmental approvals.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   The mine will add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2
billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about
30-year mine life, it says.
	   Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable
uranium reserves, but has only about 14 percent of the world
market.
	   For more than a decade until 1996, government policy prevented
the opening of new uranium mines. Currently there are only two,
ERA's Ranger and Western Mining Corp. Ltd.'s Olympic Dam.
	   ERA's success at Jabiluka is considered a litmus test for at
least a dozen other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.

Children at risk from pollution at 1,153 primary schools 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least 1,153 primary schools
scattered across Thailand are located in polluted areas and many of
their students and teachers risk lung ailments, a survey said.
	   The Bangkok Post newspaper Wednesday reported the results of the
survey by the government's primary education commission, which
showed that hundreds of schools are blanketed by dust from roads,
quarries, mines, mills and factories.
	   Hundreds more endure stench and noise emitted by factories and
25 are exposed to smoke from burning wood and rubbish. Teachers and
pupils at various schools suffer lung problems ranging from
shortness of breath to increased likelihood of tuberculosis.
	   Thailand has industrialized rapidly over the past two decades
and factories and construction sites have sprouted up around
schools with few safeguards. In one heavily industrialized coastal
area last year, primary school students were forced to wear gas
masks.

Report: Father arrested for beating stepson 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police have arrested a trucker who
whipped his 4-year-old stepson with a belt and an electric cable
because the boy threw a tantrum over dinner, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   The boy was admitted to a hospital in the northern Malaysian
town of Butterworth with bloody bruises and welts on his back and
other parts of the body, the Sun daily said.
	   Police arrived at the house on Monday night after neighbors,
alarmed by the boy's screams, called them. The boy's mother told
police that her husband lost his temper after the boy started to
throw his food.
	   The 36-year-old trucker could face up to five years in jail and
a fine of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,560) if convicted of child abuse
under Malaysia's Child Protection Act.
	   Police said they were investigating whether three other children
in the household, including a five-month-old baby, were also abused
by the man.

Habibie: Concentrate on the future, not past abuses long he may remain in power, that Suharto is ignoring him. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Habibie telling New York Times how
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie says
cash-strapped Indonesians should not try to take back the wealth of
former leader Suharto, but instead concentrate on the new
government's economic and political reforms.
	   ``My role here is to bring in the shortest time possible the
economy back and to improve the democracy,'' Habibie said in an
interview that CNN broadcast Wednesday, adding that the sweeping
changes must be made in accordance with the constitution.
	   In a separate interview with The New York Times, Habibie said
his proposal for parliamentary elections next year could leave him
in power until at least 2000.
	   The Times interview also said Suharto appears to have turned his
back on Habibie, who replaced him last month. Suharto, who ruled
for 32 years, refused to meet Habibie before stepping down and has
not communicated with him since the handover, he said.
	   Critics have accused Suharto of allowing his family to amass
fortunes and to build massive business empires through nepotism and
corruption.
	   The government this week launched a broad probe into state
corruption, but many want a specific investigation into Suharto's
wealth, estimated at between dlrs 20 billion and 40 billion.
	   Some want that money to be taken back by the state so it can use
it to help fix the country's worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The Times quoted Habibie as saying Indonesians should not
indulge in ``Wild West'' justice by trying to seize the former
president's assets.
	   Habibie defended his own family's wealth, saying its members are
highly educated and talented, and earned their money fairly.
	   Habibie, 61, has known Suharto since boyhood and was a Suharto
Cabinet minister for 20 years.
	   Despite this close links to the old government, Habibie said he
had no problems bringing in reforms.
	   In the CNN interview, Habibie urged Indonesians to look forward,
not back toward past corruption and military abuses.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop? Five years ago, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years?''
he asked. ``The future is almost unlimited. ... So I think it is
not worthwhile to dip into the past. I have to look to the future
and create a better life...for the people.''
	   Habibie, who took power when Suharto resigned following riots
and protests last month, declined to say whether he would run for
re-election after parliamentary elections are held next year.
	   He said most of Indonesia's 202 million people are suffering
badly from an inflation rate of more than 50 percent and soaring
unemployment. He said that many don't care who is the president but
instead worry about ``their rice bowls, their homes, to live in
peace, the future for their children.''
	   Habibie, a civilian and Suharto's friend and former deputy, was
confident the powerful military, which played a key role in
Suharto's departure during the unrest, would maintain its support
for him as it ``always follows the constitution.''
	   Already he has promised the election and freed some political
prisoners.
	   He likened his newfound role as a reformer to that of leaders
Boris Yeltsin in Russia and Zhu Rongji of China who brought
sweeping reforms to their countries despite being part of old
authoritarian regimes.
	   Habibie said he had no option but to reform Indonesia's battered
economy while introducing sweeping political change, saying both
were interlinked.
	   He estimated that the current Parliament will have drafted new
electoral laws by August and that these would be enacted four
months later. He said a new session of the People's Consultative
Assembly, made up of lawmakers and government appointees, would
then set a date for the election. After the ballot, the assembly
could then choose a new president.
	   At least 500 people and thousands of buildings and homes were
damaged during riots in May. But despite simmering discontent over
the economic crisis, Habibie played down the possibility of further
violence on the streets.
	   He said Indonesians wanted reform but not on the basis of
``destroying everything they have built in 30 years.''
	   He described the International Monetary Fund, which is now
revamping a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout package for Indonesia,
as playing an important and supportive role.
	   He also praised a team of economic ministers in his Cabinet,
saying: ``They are the best sons and daughters of the country.''
	   One issue that Habibie indicated would change was the fate of
East Timor, the former Portuguese territory invaded by Suharto
troops in 1975 and annexed a year later. Habibie said East Timor
must remain an integral part of Indonesia.

Baht rises; Thailand to move slowly on selling bank licenses 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai currency regained some lost
ground Wednesday due to a hike in short-term interest rates, while
the central bank announced that it will move slowly on selling the
licenses of four seized commercial banks.
	   The Bank of Thailand increased short-term interest rates through
the bond repurchase market Tuesday in a bid to stabilize the baht,
which had weakened from about 39 to the U.S. dollar last week to
close Tuesday at 42.05, its lowest level in 12 weeks.
	   The baht strengthened to 41.70 in early trading Wednesday, but
the rate hikes sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand index down 2.13
points to 311.51. Thai firms struggling to survive the current
economic crisis are desperate for lower rates.
	   The crisis-stricken financial sector, plagued by bad loans, has
been reluctant to lend fresh money to businesses. Earlier this
year, the government seized four small commercial banks deemed to
be too ridden with debt to continue operations.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, the bank governor, said Tuesday that only
one of the licenses from the seized banks will be sold this year in
an effort to ensure the government receives a fair price. The other
three licenses will be sold over the next three years.
	   The U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Inc. is advising the Bank
of Thailand on how to handle the banks' assets. It is scheduled to
submit a proposal to the central bank later this month.

Indonesia's military chief wants end to condemnation of Suharto With Indonesia-Habibie Interview 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters shouted ``Hang
Suharto'' outside Parliament on Wednesday as Indonesia's military
chief appealed for a halt to ``out of control'' condemnation of the
ousted president.
	   Suharto, a former army general who turns 77 this month, faces
growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during three
decades in power.
	   In a television interview, new President B.J. Habibie urged
Indonesians not to dwell on the country's corrupt past and to focus
on economic recovery. With the economy expected to shrink by at
least 10 percent this year, the task is a daunting one.
	   Student protesters who helped dislodge Suharto accuse him of
deepening Indonesia's financial crisis by exploiting state wealth.
The authoritarian leader quit May 21 amid campus demonstrations and
riots over price increases.
	   About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied outside Parliament on
Wednesday, demanding that Suharto be put on trial for economic
crimes. Soldiers with rifles kept an eye on the crowd from inside
the gates.
	   Chanting ``Reject Habibie,'' the protesters scoffed at their new
president's pledge to hold general elections in 1999, saying he was
a corrupt lackey of Suharto and should step aside. A close ally of
Suharto for decades, Habibie is bowing to popular demands for
democratic reform.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, said the nation of 202
million people should pardon Suharto because he boosted economic
growth and averted chaos by relinquishing power.
	   ``Lately, condemnation and harassment against the former
president and his family have been exaggerated and, in some cases,
have gotten out of control,'' said Wiranto, a former personal aide
to Suharto.
	   ``The armed forces will take necessary measures to stop it,''
Wiranto said without elaborating.
	   The military is the most powerful institution in Indonesia,
which is beset by uncertainty about its political future. It is
doubtful that Habibie, who has a shaky power base, would make any
policy decisions without the backing of Wiranto.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network that was broadcast
Wednesday, Habibie argued against a painful investigation of
misdeeds that could divide the nation.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop?'' Habibie said. ``So I think it is not worthwhile to dip
into the past. I have to look to the future and create a better
life ... for the people.''
	   In a separate interview with the New York Times, Habibie said
Indonesians should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice against the
former leader.
	   State prosecutors have launched an inquiry into corruption under
the old government, including complaints that Suharto's family
abused its influence to build huge business empires. However,
critics doubt they will aggressively pursue the former president.
	   Earlier this week, opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri urged
people to stop denouncing Suharto, who rose to power in the 1960s
by edging aside her father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno.
	   Still, sentiment against Suharto was strong among about 200
supporters of Megawati who joined students outside Parliament to
demand government action to help the poor.
	   ``Everybody knows he's corrupt so the case must be processed
legally,'' said protester Daulat Sidautar. ``It will give an
example for the future of Indonesia.''

Sri Lanka-New Zealand second Test delayed after overnight rain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The second cricket Test between Sri
Lanka and New Zealand couldn't start on time Wednesday after
overnight rain left patches of water in the outfield of the Galle
International Stadium.
	   The teams went back to their hotel, and umpires B.C. Cooray of
Sri Lanka and David Orchard of South Africa were due to inspect the
field at 11.30 a.m. local time (0530 GMT). The third umpire is Sri
Lanka's K.T. Francis.
	   The delay disappointed more than 10,000 spectators who packed
the stadium to see the first Test match to be played in the ancient
port city. Another 1,500 people lined the stone ramparts of the
nearby 17th century Dutch fort for a free bird's eye view.
	   As expected, Sri Lanka recalled experienced middle order bat
Hashan Tillekeratne and off-spinner Kumar Dharmasena, in place of
all-rounder Ruwan Kalpage and young spinner Malinga Bandara.
	   Injured New Zealand fast bowler Simon Doull was replaced by
left-arm paceman Shayne O'Conner.
	   Sri Lanka: Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan
Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardena, Aravinda de Silva, Hashan
Tillekeratne, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Muttiah Muralitharan, Niroshan
Bandaratilleke, Pramodya Wickremasinghe, Kumar Dharmasena.
	   New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Bryan Young, Mathew
Horne, Nathan Astle, Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris Cairns,
Chris Harris, Shyane O'Connor, Daniel Vettori, Paul Wiseman.

Bosnian Serb suspect pleads innocent to war crimes charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An alleged Bosnian Serb prison
chief has pleaded innocent to charges of war crimes against Muslims
and Croats at a notorious detention camp.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal charged Milojica Kos with 11
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for alleged
atrocities at the Omarska prison camp in northwestern Bosnia.
	   Kos, 35, faces up to a life sentence if convicted. The U.N.
court did not immediately set a trial date.
	   Asked by judges if he had anything to tell them, Kos responded
Tuesday: ``I have faith in justice and God, nothing more.''
	   Kos' indictment alleges he was a shift commander at Omarska,
overseeing camp guards who ``regularly and openly killed, raped,
tortured and beat'' prisoners.
	   Kos and other camp leaders ``knew or had reason to know'' that
their underlings were committing these crimes and failed to stop
them or punish the perpetrators, the indictment said.
	   Omarska was a makeshift prison camp established after Serb
forces took control of the Prijedor district of northwestern Bosnia
in May 1992. About 3,000 Muslims and Croats were rounded up and
taken to the camp.
	   Three other suspects linked to atrocities at Omarska _ Miroslav
Kvocka, Mladen Radic and Zoran Zigic _ are already in tribunal
custody in The Hague and awaiting trial.
	   Kos was arrested by NATO-led forces last week in the
northwestern Bosnian town of Banja Luka.
	   He is the 27th suspect in custody out of 74 publicly indicted by
the court.
	   The tribunal's two most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, remain free.

Virus claims 26th victim, schools closed in control effort 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A virus that attacks small children
particularly hard claimed its 26th victim on Wednesday, and
officials closed some nursery schools and kindergartens in central
Taiwan in an effort to control it.
	   Enterovirus 71 hits Taiwan each summer. Although there are no
firm numbers with which to compare, the Health Department said this
year's outbreak appears to be particularly severe.
	   It said almost 7,500 cases had been reported, but the outbreak
appears to have peaked, and that the number of new cases should
start dropping.
	   A 6-month-old boy in central Taichung city died Wednesday
morning, local health officials said. He was the 26th fatality.
Another 122 infants and small children have been hospitalized for
complications from the virus.
	   In one hospital alone, Changhua Christian Hospital in the
central city of Changhua, nine children have died since mid-May.
	   Complications from the virus, spread by physical contact, can
include encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflammation of the
heart muscle. Early symptoms are similar to the flu, including
fever, headache and vomiting. Later, ulcers or blisters in the
mouth and a rash on the hands and feet can develop.
	   Anxious parents flooded a hotline set up by the Health
Department's communicative diseases department, seeking advice on
treatment for their children.
	   Nursery schools in parts of Changhua and Tainan counties were
ordered closed for a week, and nursery schools and kindergartens in
other parts of central Taiwan were being given the option of
recessing.
	   Parents were being advised to avoid taking small children out in
public, and urged to be sure children washed their hands frequently
and had clean changes of clothing.
	   The virus has struck hardest in central Taiwan, where the warm,
wet climate is considered most conducive to its spread.

Tyson's manager claims ownership of 1956 Olympic footage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Mike Tyson's manager William Cayton
said Wednesday he bought the rights to 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games
films two years after the film producer's death.
	   Cayton, owner of American entertainment company The Big Fights
Inc., gave giving evidence by video link from New York in a Federal
Court case in which the Australian Olympic Commission (AOC) is
claiming ownership of copyright in the films.
	   The AOC has said the rights passed to it after the Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG), set up to run the Melbourne
Games, was disbanded.
	   Cayton, who said he had never been challenged before over the
ownership of rights he had acquired in hundreds of transactions,
told Justice Kevin Lindgren he bought the rights from Peter
Whitchurch Productions Pty Ltd in 1983.
	   The AOC argued that Whitchurch was in its employ and so it owns
the rights.
	   Cayton said he had never met Whitchurch, who died in 1981, and
did not do the deal personally with him.
	   ``Peter Whitchurch the individual was dead and couldn't have
signed the contract,'' Cayton said.
	   During testimony Cayton agreed with AOC attorney Tony Bannon
that he had a high profile in boxing in the United States, an
industry that received wide publicity, some of which was adverse.
	   ``Certain individuals in boxing have attracted very bad
publicity, and one in particular has attracted bad publicity, and
that's because he deserves it _ Don King,'' Cayton said.
	   He said he was not an associate of King's, and had done business
with him only when it was necessary, such as when King had the
rights to promote Tyson's world title fights.

Libya suggests deployment of African force between Eritrea, Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Amid growing tensions between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has proposed the deployment
of an African force between the two countries.
	   Libyan television, quoting a report by the official news agency,
JANA, said Tuesday night that Gadhafi sent a message to the
Eritrean and Ethiopian presidents proposing sending troops from the
grouping of Sahel and Saharan countries to replace the
``belligerent forces in the disputed areas.''
	   The Sahel and Saharan countries group Libya, Sudan, Chad, Mali,
Niger and Burkina Faso.
	   Gadhafi also asked an official representing the African group to
travel to the area and put the proposal to the two leaders,
according to the Libyan television broadcast which was monitored by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Last month, Ethiopia accused Eritrean forces of incursions into
Ethiopian territory. Eritrea denies the claims and has suggested
international mediation. Ethiopia rejects direct negotiations until
Eritrea withdraws and has threatened to use force if it does not.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrea is illegally occupying the 400
square kilometer (160 square mile) Yirga triangle in northwestern
Ethiopia as well as other areas in the northeast.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, after a
30-year war, and according to standards established by the
Organization of African Unity, the border agreed upon was the one
drawn by the Italians.

Hitler potato chip ads will be withdrawn, Israel says 
</HEADLINE>
By PATRICK McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Israeli diplomats said Wednesday that
an advertising agency has agreed to immediately stop airing
commercials using images of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to sell
potato chips.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy, praised the
Thai office of the Chicago-based Leo Burnett agency for killing the
ads once they became aware of how offensive they were.
	   ``We're happy with this action,'' Nil said. ``If they had
realized the real meaning to people like us and other victims of
the Nazis, they would never have started in the first place.''
	   Nil said that he had received verbal and written assurances from
Leo Burnett Bangkok confirming that commercials featuring Hitler
would be pulled off Thai television immediately.
	   Removing similar placards from thousands of three-wheeled
motorized taxis plying Bangkok's streets was expected to take until
Sunday due to technical reasons, Nil said.
	   ``We have achieved our goal, the case is closed,'' Nil said.
``The vigorous response shows there was really no bad intention.''
	   Leo Burnett representatives were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Israeli officials viewed the ads as morally unacceptable, saying
Hitler should not be used as a means to make money. Hitler
unleashed World War II in Europe and killed millions of people,
including 6 million Jews, he considered subhuman, the worst
genocide the world has ever seen.
	   The commercial for X potato chips, targeted at Thai teen-agers,
depicts Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman who casts a
spell on him as he eats the chips, hoping to change his evil ways.
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   Leo Burnett said the ads, shown only in Thailand, were meant to
show the world would be a better place if happiness prevailed. The
chips are made by Food Processing Co. Ltd., a Thai firm.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok apologized for the ads Sunday and had been
discussing the campaign with its client for the past few days.
	   Nil has said the controversy should raise awareness about Hitler
among Thais. Consciousness about the Nazis is somewhat less in
Asia, where their armies did not reach, than in the West.
	   Thailand has in the past expressed outrage over the use of
people dressed as Buddhist monks in advertisements. Buddhism is the
country's dominant religions and monks are generally revered.

Diprose says England facing `massive challenge' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ New England rugby captain Tony
Diprose admitted his team faced a ``massive challenge'' in
Saturday's test against Australia at Suncorp Stadium.
	   Diprose took over as captain Wednesday after Matt Dawson was
forced out of the match because of knee ligament damage on Tuesday.
	   Diprose, 25, described his promotion, after just seven tests in
the team, as a surprise. He will lead an inexperienced and
much-maligned team with five new caps.
	   But Diprose has echoed the sentiments of England officials, who
believe the young players have a good opportunity to set up
long-term careers.
	   ``There is a great opportunity for the players on this tour to
press their claims ahead of next year's World Cup,'' Diprose said.
``They have got everything to play for. This game represents a
massive challenge.''
	   Diprose said he aimed to lead by example.
	   ``The team is primarily young and inexperienced,'' Diprose said.
``However, there is a lot of enthusiasm, skill and talent which we
are looking to harness.''
	   Diprose was uncapped a year ago but has since gone on to play
for the British Lions, and captained Saracens in their English Cup
final triumph.
	   ``Hopefully, there is a lot more to come yet, especially with
the World Cup campaign next year,'' Diprose said. ``Captaining
England is obviously a great honor, although I don't think it will
actually hit home until I walk out of the tunnel on Saturday
night.''
	   Dawson was appointed captain three weeks ago when Lawrence
Dallaglio was ruled out by injury. His loss means Austin Healey
will cover for scrum-half Scott Benton.

Dollar edges lower, stocks fall in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon currency, bond; ADDS
trader comment in 12th graf, byline
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen
Wednesday amid speculation about possible intervention by world
central banks to prop up the Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 138.41 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.84
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of
138.83 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 207.45 points,
or 1.33 percent, to close at 15,347.00. On Tuesday, the index
gained 233.42 points, or 1.52 percent.
	   The dollar slipped as traders speculated that the Group of Seven
major industrialized nations will jointly intervene to help stem
the slide of the yen.
	   On Monday, the Japanese currency reached a seven-year low
against the dollar as pessimism about the outlook for Japan's
economy prompted investors to shift funds out of yen and into the
U.S. currency.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stoked speculation about
joint intervention Tuesday when he confirmed that there will be a
G-7 meeting ``sometime early next week.'' Rubin also told reporters
that Washington shares Tokyo's concern over the yen's weakness.
	   Pessimism about Japan's economy also drove down Tokyo stock
prices.
	   The decline by the benchmark index wiped out most of the
previous day's gains. One reason for the lack of buyers: Government
money that had boosted stock prices the day before wasn't there
Wednesday, traders said.
	   Japan has used government-controlled pension savings recently in
brazen efforts to keep the Nikkei 225 above the psychologically
important 15,000-point level.
	   ``There was a price-keeping operation Tuesday. Today, it has
completely stopped,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a managing director at
Chuo Securities Co.
	   Investors were also discouraged by an overnight fall on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 31.13
points, or 0.35 percent, to 8,891.24.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,205.33.
The TOPIX rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent on Tuesday.
	   The benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond edged up
to 1.140 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.130 percent. Its price
fell to 112.51 yen from 112.59 yen.

Central bank employee sues former branch manager over sexual harassment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 28-year-old employee of the Kyoto branch of
Japan's central bank has sued her former boss over alleged sexual
harassment, seeking compensation and an apology, a court official
said Wednesday.
	   In the suit filed Tuesday with a local court, the woman is
seeking a total of 21 million yen (dlrs 152,000) in damages from
both the former branch manager and the central bank.
	   A spokesman for the Bank of Japan in Tokyo said the bank could
not comment on the suit because a written complaint had yet to be
made available. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The 51-year-old branch manager resigned voluntarily from the
bank at the end of March, this year, without mentioning specific
reasons, the spokesman said.
	   The official at the Kyoto District Court, where the suit was
filed, said the names of the defendant and the plaintiff could not
be made public at present. He also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In the suit, the woman says that she was sexually harassed by
the former manager at a private nightclub in Kyoto on the night of
Nov. 19 after she was invited there by him to ``try to establish
better mutual understanding'' on the job, the Yomiuri newspaper
said.
	   The former manager kissed her and touched her against her will
at the club, the report said.
	   The paper also said he had repeatedly tried to lure her out for
meals, despite being turned down at the central bank branch in
Kyoto, 374 kilometers (234 miles), southwest of Tokyo.
	   Sexual harassment is a fairly new concept in largely
male-dominated Japan, where such conduct was largely tolerated
until recent years. The nation's first sexual harassment lawsuit
wasn't filed until 1992.
	   Last year, Japan's Parliament adopted a law that requires
corporations to take steps to prevent sexual harassment.
	   Last month, a court in western Japan fined a male university
professor 1.7 million yen (dlrs 12,300) for sexually harassing a
woman student.

Libya suggests deployment of African force between Eritrea, Ethiopia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Amid growing tensions between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has proposed the deployment
of an African force between the two countries.
	   Libyan television, quoting a report by the official news agency,
JANA, said Tuesday night that Gadhafi sent a message to the
Eritrean and Ethiopian presidents proposing sending troops from the
grouping of Sahel and Saharan countries to replace the
``belligerent forces in the disputed areas.''
	   The Sahel and Saharan countries group Libya, Sudan, Chad, Mali,
Niger and Burkina Faso.
	   Gadhafi also asked an official representing the African group to
travel to the area and put the proposal to the two leaders,
according to the Libyan television broadcast which was monitored by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Last month, Ethiopia accused Eritrean forces of incursions into
Ethiopian territory. Eritrea denies the claims and has suggested
international mediation. Ethiopia rejects direct negotiations until
Eritrea withdraws and has threatened to use force if it does not.
	   Ethiopia claims that Eritrea is illegally occupying the
400-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) Yirga triangle in
northwestern Ethiopia as well as other areas in the northeast.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, after a
30-year war, and according to standards established by the
Organization of African Unity, the border agreed upon was the one
drawn by the Italians.

Australia pressing for independent bridge collapse inquiry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is
likely to take up the cause of the families of the victims of last
July's Israeli bridge collapse disaster when he visits Israel this
weekend, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Downer is due to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
other senior Israeli leaders during his four-day trip to Israel and
Egypt beginning this Saturday.
	   His spokesman said although the focus of talks would be the
stalled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Downer
would almost certainly raise the July 14 bridge collapse disaster
which claimed four Australian lives.
	   However, time constraints would make a meeting between the
minister and families of the victims before he departed this
weekend unlikely, he said.
	   Families' spokesman Colin Elterman urged Downer on Wednesday to
press for an independent Knesset inquiry into the disaster.
	   Elterman's 16-year-old daughter Sasha was one of dozens of
Australian athletes injured when a footbridge leading to the Tel
Aviv stadium collapsed during the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah
Games, or so-called Jewish Olympics.
	   Four Australians died in the aftermath.
	   Prime Minister John Howard confirmed on Tuesday that Netanyahu
was due to arrive in Australia in August.

Economists see some joy for East Asia in 1999 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ It may be a gloomy year for Asia but a
recovery, or at least a stabilization, is in sight, according to
the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and The Asia Foundation.
	   In a report entitled ``1998-1999 Pacific Economic Outlook'' the
PECC panel of economists looked at the growth forecasts of 20 East
Asian, North American and Latin American economies.
	   At a regional video link-up Wednesday, three of the economists
indicated they expected a moderate recovery for the Asia Pacific
region in 1999.
	   The report forecasts an average growth in GDP of only 2.6
percent for the Asia Pacific region in 1998, down nearly 2
percentage points from 1997.
	   However, it said there was a strong chance that ``the
Asia-Pacific region would achieve relative financial stability in
the second half of 1998, and the real economy will begin to recover
by the end of 1998 or beginning of 1999.''
	   ``If that is the case then 1999 could be a recovery year, with
real GDP growth for the region advancing to 3.5 percent,'' said
project coordinator Professor Lawrence Krause.
	   The panel attributed much of the hoped-for turnaround to the
success of the latest stimulus package from Japan's government and
expected that while that country will have a growth rate around
zero this year it should be up and running near 2.5 percent in
1999.
	   ``The Japanese will take steps to accelerate their economy,''
said Dr. Saul Hymans, professor of economics at the University of
Michigan.
	   He noted that it was crucial that the fiscal expansion included
new measures of tax cuts and expenditures.
	   ``There is evidence of real fiscal expansion in Japan,'' he
said.
	   Dr. Steve Parker, chief economist with The Asia Foundation, said
a recovery in 1999 with Japan's growth running at 2.5 percent was
predicated on successful fiscal stimulus.
	   He said other nations in the region would have a hard, slow
battle back from the brink.
	   Nevertheless, he noted positive signs in South Korea and
expected that its economy would bottom this year.
	   There was cause for optimism as export volumes were heading
higher and the current account was expanding, he said.
	   The basket case in the region remained Indonesia, due primarily
to social unrest and political instability.
	   Along with Indonesia and Japan, Thailand and South Korea are
also expected to sustain zero growth rates this year.
	   However, with the exception of Indonesia, they are expected to
recover next year.

Pakistan looks to austerity to offset threatened sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan ordered new austerity
measures Wednesday, moving fast to protect its fragile economy from
economic sanctions threatened in response to its decision to test
six nuclear devices.
	   In a Cabinet meeting a day earlier, the government sought to
find ways to minimize the impact of sanctions, most notably from
the United States and Japan.
	   The government plans to cut spending overall by 50 percent, but
the details will be worked out over the next 24 hours, said the
independent daily newspaper, The News.
	   ``Specific measures with respect to austerity and efficiency in
missions abroad have also been approved,'' said an official
announcement following the Cabinet meeting.
	   Immediately after Pakistan tested its sixth nuclear device on
Saturday, President Rafiq Tarar used his constitutional authority
to declare a state of emergency and freeze all foreign currency
accounts.
	   Accounts were frozen because the government feared a panic
withdrawal would devour its foreign exchange reserves, currently
about dlrs 1.3 billion.
	   Finance Minister Sartaz Aziz said the government has a
three-pronged plan to counter sanctions _ increase exports,
decrease imports and conserve revenues.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is to address the nation on Thursday
to provide the details of his austerity program. He also is
expected to make another strong pitch for restraint and belt
tightening, something he did in his speech to the nation last week
following Pakistan's first round of nuclear testing.
	   In Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, the government decided to reduce
imports of such items as tea, cooking oil and milk _ all staples in
the Pakistani diet.
	   In its first show of restraint, the government moved out of the
palatial 400-room Prime minister's secretariat. The move is meant
to give the impression that the government is leaving behind
extravagance and embracing moderation.
	   Analysts expect sanctions will hurt the poorest in this country
of 140 million people with a per capital annual income of just less
than dlrs 400.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters shouted ``Hang
Suharto'' outside Parliament on Wednesday as Indonesia's military
chief appealed for a halt to ``out of control'' condemnation of the
ousted president.
	   Suharto, a former army general who turns 77 next Monday, faces
growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during three
decades in power.
	   In a television interview, new President B.J. Habibie urged
Indonesians not to dwell on the country's corrupt past and to focus
on economic recovery. With the economy expected to shrink by at
least 10 percent this year, the task is a daunting one.
	   Student protesters who helped dislodge Suharto accuse him of
deepening Indonesia's financial crisis by exploiting state wealth.
The authoritarian leader quit May 21 amid campus demonstrations and
riots over price increases.
	   A government commission, meanwhile, said the death toll over
several days of riots in Jakarta in mid-May was 1,188, more than
double an estimate by the military. Many victims were looters
trapped in buildings set afire by arsonists.
	   In a report released Wednesday, the National Commission on Human
Rights also criticized the armed forces for failing to take prompt
action to prevent rioting.
	   About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied in a major highway
outside Parliament, demanding that Suharto be put on trial for
economic crimes. Soldiers closed off the road.
	   Chanting ``Reject Habibie,'' the protesters scoffed at their new
president's pledge to hold general elections in 1999, saying he was
a corrupt lackey of Suharto and should step aside. A close ally of
Suharto for decades, Habibie is bowing to popular demands for
democratic reform.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, said the nation of 202
million people should pardon Suharto because he boosted economic
growth and averted chaos by relinquishing power.
	   ``Lately, condemnation and harassment against the former
president and his family have been exaggerated and, in some cases,
have gotten out of control,'' said Wiranto, a former personal aide
to Suharto.
	   ``The armed forces will take necessary measures to stop it,''
Wiranto said without elaborating.
	   The military is the most powerful institution in Indonesia,
which is beset by uncertainty about its political future. It is
doubtful that Habibie, who has a shaky power base, would make any
policy decisions without the backing of Wiranto.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network that was broadcast
Wednesday, Habibie argued against a painful investigation of
misdeeds that could divide the nation.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop?'' Habibie said. ``So I think it is not worthwhile to dip
into the past. I have to look to the future and create a better
life ... for the people.''
	   In a separate interview with the New York Times, Habibie said
Indonesians should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice against the
former leader.
	   State prosecutors have launched an inquiry into corruption under
the old government, including complaints that Suharto's family
abused its influence to build huge business empires. However,
critics doubt they will aggressively pursue the former president.
	   Earlier this week, opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri urged
people to stop denouncing Suharto, who rose to power in the 1960s
by edging aside her father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno.
	   Still, sentiment against Suharto was strong among about 200
supporters of Megawati who joined students outside Parliament to
demand government action to help the poor.
	   ``Everybody knows he's corrupt so the case must be processed
legally,'' said protester Daulat Sidautar. ``It will give an
example for the future of Indonesia.''

Philippine government lawyer urges reversal of Imelda Marcos graft conviction 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government's chief lawyer said
Wednesday he has asked the Supreme Court to reverse a 1993 graft
conviction of former first lady Imelda Marcos and spare her from a
possible 12-year jail term.
	   The surprise turnaround is a potential victory for the widow of
the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, but there was no
indication how the court will treat the recommendation.
	   In the past, the court has rarely reversed a decision it has
upheld.
	   Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz said he became convinced
there was no strong evidence proving Mrs. Marcos was guilty of the
graft charge after a review of the case.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted of graft, although she faces numerous other criminal and
civil cases related to the 20-year rule of her husband.
	   She and her husband have been accused of stealing billions of
dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986 ``people
power'' revolt and Marcos died three years later in exile in
Hawaii.
	   Mrs. Marcos was convicted of having granted leases on
government-owned land at improperly low rates to the Philippine
General Hospital Foundation, which she headed. The land was then
sublet to another company at much higher rates.
	   De la Cruz said there was no evidence proving that the land was
leased at improperly low rates, except that it had been later
sublet at a higher amount.
	   He said they also found that the land lease deals were entered
into by former transportation chief Jose Dans, Mrs. Marcos'
co-defendant in the case, who was earlier acquitted by the Supreme
Court.
	   Mrs. Marcos _ who insists she did not personally benefit from
the deal _ said the money gained from the leases helped finance
construction of the Philippine Heart Center. Prosecutors did not
challenge this, but maintained that the foundation should have been
charged more.
	   A five-judge Supreme Court panel upheld her conviction in
January, but ruled that she could appeal one more time to the
entire court before going to prison. It sentenced her to nine to 12
years in prison and ordered her to pay 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.9
million) in damages to the government.
	   She appealed in February and the court asked de la Cruz's office
to provide an opinion on her appeal.
	   The Supreme Court has up to two years to decide the appeal.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he may pardon Mrs.
Marcos if the conviction is upheld.

Report: Japan's next-generation F-2 fighter jet has major defect 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's next-generation F-2 fighter has a major
defect that could make it hard to control when carrying missiles
under its wings, a news agency reported.
	   Japan's Air Self-Defense Force, which is now testing the plane,
has found that the F-2's wings flutter violently when the jet
accelerates while carrying a payload of anti-ship missiles, Jiji
Press reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.
	   While most fighter jets shake and become hard to control at
extremely high speeds, the F-2's flutter occurs at 600 kilometers
per hour (372 mph), or about two-thirds the velocity at which its
predecessor, the F-1, exhibits such shaking, Jiji said.
	   In the worst-case scenario, the vibration could cause the jet to
break up in mid-flight, Jiji said.
	   A spokesman for Japan's self defense forces refused to comment
on the story, saying the agency would issue a report when flight
testing on the F-2 finishes early next year.
	   According to Jiji, self-defense force officials are trying to
find a way to strengthen the wing before the jets are put into
active service.
	   Japan had initially sought to develop the new warplane on its
own, but under U.S. pressure agreed in 1988 to design and build the
new jet jointly with American manufacturers.
	   The F-2, which was called the FSX during development, was based
on the U.S. F-16. It uses U.S. technology for the engine and parts
of the fuselage, and a Japanese advanced carbon graphite in the
wings. Lockheed Martin and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries make the
plane's body.
	   Japan has already spent 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7.2 billion) to
develop the jet. It plans to buy 130 of the new F-2 fighters over
the next ten years to replace its aging F-1 fleet.
	   The planes cost 16 billion yen (dlrs 115 million) each.

Indonesian human rights watchdog doubles riot death toll to 1,188 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Indonesia; BC-Indonesia-Habibie Interview
By ALI KOTARUMALOS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's main human rights watchdog
Monday said at least 1,188 people died in rioting that led to the
resignation of autocratic President Suharto last month.
	   The figure is more than twice as high as official estimates made
by the military, which the National Human Rights Commission, or
Komnasham, accused of doing too little, too late to quell the
violence and save lives.
	   ``Komnasham has received quantitative reports that there was an
excessive material loss because of the riotings, including ... the
killings of 1,188 people and 101 injuries along with some cases of
rape,'' the commission said in a report.
	   It said 40 shopping centers, 2,479 shop-houses and 1,604 shops
were attacked, burned or looted, along with 1,119 automobiles,
1,026 private homes and 383 offices.
	   The commission did not provide a breakdown of the death toll,
but said it was based on reports in Jakarta and other parts of the
country from May 12-25.
	   It noted that security forces had failed to anticipate signs
that rioting would erupt. Moreover, when the violence started
``there were no signs of serious efforts by the security forces to
prevent the spread of the rioting.''
	   The 25-member commission urged the government of new President
B.J. Habibie to ``thoroughly investigate security apparatus for
letting, not preventing or immediately dealing with the riots.''
	   It also called for an inquiry into allegations that much of the
violence had been the work of ``well-organized groups who started
the rioting and burnings.''
	   In a three-page statement, the commission noted that members of
the ethnic Chinese community were frequent targets in the unrest.
	   Although Chinese make up only a fraction of Indonesia's 202
million population, they dominate commerce and industry, and have
been made into scapegoats for the country's worst economic crisis
in three decades.
	   The commission was set up by the Suharto regime but has earned a
reputation for independence in its investigation of human rights
abuses.

Sodium cyanide spill in Kyrgyzstan claims first victim 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sodium cyanide spill which sickened 600 people
and polluted an ecologically important lake in the former Soviet
republic of Kyrgyzstan claimed its first fatality on Wednesday,
officials said.
	   The woman, whose identity wasn't given, died in a hospital in
the town of Karakol near Lake Issyk Kul, one of the largest bodies
of water in Central Asia, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Interfax quoted doctors saying that the patient had died of
sodium cyanide poisoning that exacerbated her previous illness.
	   A truck carrying 20 tons of highly toxic sodium cyanide powder
to a gold mine veered off a mountain road on May 20 and crashed
into the Barskaan river, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul. The huge
lake is the center of a valuable nature preserve and home to
several rare species.
	   The damaged containers leaked 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of
sodium cyanide into the river and some of it reached the lake.
	   The Canadian firm Cameco, the world's largest publicly traded
uranium company, operates the Kumtor mine through its subsidiary
the Kumtor Operating Co.
	   Kyrgyz officials have said the river and the lake were not
expected to suffer any long-term damage. Kumtor has also sought to
downplay the damage, saying it posed ``no serious threat to people,
animals or agriculture.''
	   However, fish and cattle were killed near the site of the spill
and some 600 people have sought medical treatment for poisoning, of
whom about 100 have been hospitalized.
	   Farmland has also been contaminated by villagers unaware of the
spill who used water from the river on their crops, officials said.

Henry denied Wales bid 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Auckland Blues coach Graham Henry
wanted to lead Wales at next year's World Cup, but has been denied
by the New Zealand rugby union.
	   Henry led Auckland to two Super 12 titles in succession before
last week's loss in the final against Canterbury, as it sought
three in a row.
	   Henry was told he would be held to his New Zealand Rugby
Football Union (NZRFU) contract, which runs until the end of next
year, according to NZRFU sources.
	   It was the second rebuff for Henry, who was headhunted last
season to see if he would move to England to become the union's
technical director, with prospects of being national coach.
	   That would have cut across Henry's long-term target of becoming
All Black coach. There were suggestions he switch to coach the
Otago Highlanders to give him a bigger challenge than staying with
the Blues.
	   After turning down that idea and the England scheme, Henry
signed a revised two-season deal with Auckland and the NZRFU until
the end of 1999.
	   But recently Wales came shopping for a coach after another
dismal Five Nations tournament and the six-figure salary and job
prospects must have tempted Henry.
	   It is understood he made several inquiries last week of the
NZRFU about varying his contract but was refused.
	   Henry refused to comment on the matter Wednesday.
	   Welsh director of rugby Terry Cobner said he had spoken to a
number of candidates in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa,
and hinted that Henry was among them.

Singapore labor figures show layoffs, unemployment rising 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore released figures Wednesday showing a
dramatic increase in layoffs and unemployment during the current
economic slowdown, and predicted harder times ahead.
	   Labor department officials said there was also less work
available, while the entire job picture worsened ``significantly in
the first quarter of 1998, as impact of the regional economic and
currency crisis sank in.''
	   The report from the Ministry of Manpower, as the labor
department is officially called, is the latest sign that the nearly
year-old Asian economic turmoil is taking a heavy toll on this
usually prosperous city state.
	   The report said layoffs reached a record high for any quarterly
figure at 7,131, while the number of job openings dropped to
26,148, 44 percent lower than the same period last year.
	   The ministry added that demand for new workers is likely to fall
further and unemployment will rise as local graduates enter the
work force in the next few months.
	   The first-quarter job losses equaled 73 percent of all layoffs
last year, affecting primarily workers in manufacturing, the sector
hardest hit so far.
	   Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to 2.2 percent at the end
of the quarter.
	   A union leader said earlier this week that layoffs in Singapore
this year will likely rise to an all-time high as the country edges
towards economic doldrums.
	   Lim Boon Heng, chief of the National Trade Union Congress, said
the number of workers losing their jobs will probably exceed the
peak of 20,000 during the 1985-86 recession.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong cautioned earlier this week that
some private analysts predict unemployment rising to 4 percent by
year end.
	   In their bleak outlook for the current quarter, the ministry
said expectations were ``less favorable especially in the
manufacturing sector,'' with further declines in the electronics,
engineering and other manufacturing businesses.
	   Singapore's work force totaled nearly 1.9 million people out of
a total population of 3.1 million, according to the latest
government statistics for last year.

Six Rwandans convicted for killing U.N. monitors that driver wounded in attack did not survive.

Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with court postponing other verdict. CORRECTS
<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Six Rwandans convicted of killing four
U.N. human rights monitors last year have been sentenced to death,
the Rwanda News Agency reported.
	   The monitors and their driver _ one Briton, one Cambodian and
three Rwandans _ were ambushed near Cyangugu, 240 kilometers (150
miles) southwest of the capital, Kigali, and on the border with
Congo, which the Hutu rebels easily cross. The driver died on the
way to the hospital.
	   A court in Cyangugu delivered the verdict on May 26, but it was
not reported until Tuesday. The five men and one woman were
captured shortly after the February 1997 attack and charged in
March.
	   Authorities have said the six were Hutu rebels intent on
destabilizing the government.
	   The killings have severely restricted the activities of U.N.
human rights monitors. Last month, the government decided to
suspend monitoring activities until it negotiates a new agreement
with the United Nations.
	   On Wednesday, a court postponed a verdict in the case of
Euphrasie Kamatamu, a former councilor accused of organizing the
slaughter of Tutsis in Kigali. The prosecutor has requested the
death penalty for the 53-year-old Hutu, her husband and two other
accomplices.
	   So far, the Rwandan courts have convicted and sentenced to death
more than 100 people in connection with the slaughter of at least
500,000 mostly minority Tutsis in 1994.
	   Firing squads publicly executed the first 22 convicts on April
24. In total, 130,000 people are awaiting trial in overcrowded
jails throughout Rwanda.

U.S. alarms industry by demanding drug profits from offshore bank

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ A landmark U.S. lawsuit aimed at
forcing an offshore Caribbean bank to surrender millions in drug
profits is unnerving a secretive banking industry that thrives on
lack of scrutiny and perceived inviolability.
	   The case dates to the 1980s, when two Massachusetts brothers ran
a large-scale marijuana business in New England. Once convicted,
they fingered their money launderer, who confessed and promised to
forfeit dlrs 7 million to the U.S. government.
	   The effort went awry when the man, John E. Fitzgerald of Boston,
died before handing over the money. Now the U.S. Justice Department
wants a Boston court to order the Antiguan bank where Fitzgerald
said he deposited the money to pay up.
	   The case against Swiss American Bank Ltd. and its non-offshore
sister Swiss American National Bank of Antigua Ltd. is now being
heard.
	   Local critics see the lawsuit as bullying of small island states
by Washington, which already had pressured its Caribbean neighbors
into allowing U.S. law enforcers to take their war on drugs into
their territory.
	   The Antiguan government, feeling both its sovereignty and its
prized offshore banking industry threatened, sent a diplomatic
protest urging the United States to withdraw the action.
	   Undaunted by the protest, Washington is looking for tougher
legislation to close ``loopholes related to foreign banking secrecy
laws,'' a U.S. State Department official said.
	   In addition to asset seizure and forfeiture laws, U.S. officials
want to use ``foreign-based crimes'' such as fraud against foreign
governments to justify U.S. money laundering prosecutions, the
official said.
	   For Caribbean offshore bankers, who contribute significantly to
the region's economy, it is an unwelcome assault at a time when
Britain is pressing them to release secret account information for
the drug fight.
	   That, they say, would destroy the industry by scaring away
legitimate clients.
	   ``We will not stand by and allow them to kill off our
business,'' said Neville Grant, managing director of the Cayman
Islands Monetary Authority, which controls about 500 banks and
companies, second only to Switzerland as an international banking
center.
	   Analysts estimate that up to 10 percent of the $5 trillion held
in offshore centers worldwide is laundered money.
	   Some governments voluntarily repatriate drug money to the United
States, which shares it with the cooperating government.
	   Antigua, which has been tarred with allegations of drug-related
corruption, shut down five offshore Russian banks last year under
U.S. pressure. But the government is supporting Swiss American
Bank's argument that the United States has no jurisdiction over an
Antiguan bank.
	   The dlrs 7 million was promised the U.S. government by
Fitzgerald, who pleaded guilty in 1993 to racketeering and money
laundering.
	   However, Fitzgerald concealed the true ownership of the money a
little too well _ failing to prove his link to the string of shell
companies that held it.
	   Complicating matters, the bank now claims that one of its
managers, who was authorized by Fitzgerald to manage his account,
took dlrs 2 million and disappeared.
	   The remaining money was given to the Antiguan government in 1994
under a law about frozen accounts with no clear owner, the bank
said.
	   The United States says the bank had no right to touch
Fitzgerald's _ now the U.S. government's _ money. And Washington
has a big stick to wield: The offshore bankers depend on U.S. banks
to make investments, including treasury bonds.

Former coach criticizes Sri Lankan officials 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) - Sacked Sri Lankan cricket coach Bruce
Yardley warned the country would fail to reach its test potential
unless officials stopped meddling with the team.
	   Yardley, a former Australian test player, led the Sri Lankans
for 16 months until he was replaced by Roy Dias after the tour of
South Africa earlier this year.
	   ``There are a lot of people in Sri Lanka who want to be part of
the team but aren't, that was the biggest problem,'' Yardley said
Wednesday. ``They've got all the talent there, but there is more
interference from outside the team than I've ever seen anywhere
else in the world.''
	   Yardley said the interference distracted the team.
	   ``It gets to the players and there is a lot of pressure on
them,'' Yardley said. ``If people just left them alone to play
cricket, I think they could really go on from here.''
	   Yardley said the performance of the team on tour of South Africa
demonstrated its capabilities despite losing both tests. The Sri
Lankans also lost the first test against New Zealand last week
under Dias' leadership.
	   ``We came back to Sri Lanka all very excited about what we
learned there (South Africa) and we were going to go on from
there,'' Yardley said.
	   ``But then there was a change at the top at the cricket board
and they wanted to restructure the whole coaching program, which
virtually ended it for me.
	   ``I really believe we were on the track, because there is so
much talent there.''

EDS: LEADS throughout with political parties reaching consensus on
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Major Hong Kong political parties told the
government on Wednesday that it wasn't doing enough to stimulate
the recession-bound economy, and reached consensus on their own
six-point program.
	   The announcements were made after a special meeting of parties
that won seats in the new legislature elected a week and a half
ago.
	   It included government critics, pro-business parties that
generally support the government, and grassroots pro-China parties.
	   Their ability to bridge differences could mean that, despite
being controlled by pro-business and pro-China elites, the
legislature may give Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his
government a hard time on economic issues.
	   ``The government is wealthy,'' said Allen Lee, chairman of the
pro-business Liberal Party, who chaired the meeting. ``It's the
citizens who don't have money.''
	   Lee said the package aims to boost consumer spending and create
a better business environment.
	   While the parties were meeting, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
convened the first government task force to discuss the labor
market, review retraining programs, and create more government
jobs.
	   Unemployment is officially at a 14-year high of 3.9 percent,
although unions say the figure is much higher. It is expected to
increase as Hong Kong, which avoided the worst of Asia's economic
crisis for nearly a year, settles into a protracted battle with low
stock and property prices.
	   The economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and one senior official said late Tuesday that it would
likely shrink in the second quarter, too. That technically would
put Hong Kong in recession.
	   More than 80 people demonstrated outside the government building
where Tsang convened the closed employment meeting, demanding cuts
in taxes and government fees to encourage business and employment,
Hong Kong Radio reported.
	   After the party roundtable, representatives told reporters that
they want the government ``to put money back into people's
pockets.''
	   Their proposals include cuts in public transportation charges
and government fees, and more assistance to small- and medium-sized
businesses that form the backbone of Hong Kong's economy.
	   They also want a review of a system that requires pre-payment of
taxes, and asked the government to return pre-paid taxes. To create
more jobs, they say the government should push ahead infrastructure
projects and provide more social services.
	   The government also should find ways to hold down interest
rates, which have remained high to defend Hong Kong's link to the
U.S. dollar, the representatives said.
	   Lee said the parties would back a deficit budget next year if
neccessary.
	   ``In a rainstorm, the government should lend the citizens an
umbrella,'' Lee said.

Court sentences two Tunisians to 20 years for Cools killing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ A Tunisian court has convicted and
sentenced two Tunisians to 20 years in prison for killing Belgian
lawmaker Andre Cools, a prominent Socialist and former
vice-minister.
	   Abdelmajid El Almi, 33, and Abdeljellil Ben Brahim, 26, admitted
during the trial Tuesday that they killed Cools and wounded his
girlfriend outside her home in a Liege suburb in July 1991.
	   But the two defendants said they were hired by an unidentified
Sicialian who told them Cools was a high Belgian police official
and drug dealer who blocked them from drug trafficking.
	   The two were sentenced to 20 years for the premeditated murder
of Cools and five years for the attempted murder of Cools'
girlfriend, Marie Helen Joiret.
	   The lawyer representing the Cools family, Sassi Ben Alima, said
the verdict was ``satisfactory'' for the two Tunisians, who under
Tunisian law faced the death penalty or life in prison.
	   The two were arrested after another Belgian minister, Alain Van
Der Biest, was arrested in September 1996 on suspicion of having
ordered the killing.

Thai women spend less on clothes as economy declines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Beauty is taking a back seat to
pricetags as Bangkok's women office workers buy fewer clothes
because of the country's economic crisis, a new study shows.
	   A survey released Wednesday of 391 women office workers in
Bangkok by the Thai Farmers' Bank showed that 93.8 percent said the
crisis had affected their spending on work apparel.
	   The survey showed that 35.2 percent have stopped buying new
dresses altogether, while 33 percent said they are buying fewer.
	   Among women whose monthly salary ranges from 5,000 baht to
15,000 baht (dlrs 125 to dlrs 375), most said cost is the most
important factor in selecting work clothes.
	   Those with salaries between 15,001 to 35,000 baht (dlrs 375 to
dlrs 875) chose comfort instead. A majority whose salary tops
35,000 baht (dlrs 875) considered appearance the most important
factor.
	   Thailand's economy has nosedived since last year, forcing many
Thais to tighten spending and save money out of fear of losing
their jobs. Many employers have slashed salaries and bonuses.

Prosecution prepares to bring apartheid killer to Botha trial

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ State prosecutors on Wednesday
prepared to bring one of apartheid's most notorious killers to
testify in the trial of former President P. W. Botha.
	   Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, a body probing apartheid crimes. But his
trial has turned into a hearing on his possible complicity in
state-sanctioned killings and violence.
	   Former police Col. Eugene de Kock carried out the 1988 bombing
of Khotso House, the Johannesburg headquarters of an anti-apartheid
church group, and a former police chief has told the commission
Botha ordered the bombing.
	   As the trial resumed Wednesday, prosecutor Bruce Morrison
quickly asked for an adjournment as he ``consulted'' with the next
witness. Morrison did not name the witness, but Truth Commission
lawyer Jeremy Gauntlett confirmed to reporters it was de Kock.
	   De Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the nickname Prime Evil,
is serving two life sentences plus 212 years on six charges of
murder and 83 other convictions.
	   He believes he has been sold out by the general and politicians
above him
	   who have mostly denied ordering human rights abuses, claiming
such acts were
	   the work of rogue operatives.
	   Early Wednesday, Botha's defense team cross-examined two
witnesses to the Khotso House bombing: security guard Welcome
Ntumba and the former leader of the Methodist Church in South
Africa, the Rev. Peter Storey.
	   Lawyer Lappe Laubscher, who had opposed the calling of the
witnesses as irrelevant to the charges, declined to ask any
questions.
	   However, Storey, who currently lives in Delaware, Ohio, asked
the court to pursue whoever was responsible for the attack.
	   ``I have come a long way to give evidence here and I hope that
there will be clarification about who stands accountable for the
explosion,'' he said. ``It was in my view the most violent act by
the apartheid state against the church of God.''
	   Botha, who ruled for eleven years before being ousted in 1989 by
reform-minded President F.W. de Klerk, denies he ordered the
bombing.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Spain's industry and energy minister
signaled Wednesday that his government will not stand in the way of
a Spanish firm's bid for an Australian mining company.
	   Responding to a reporter's question about Asturiana de Zinc
S.A.'s bid for Perth-based, Western Metals Ltd., the visiting
minister, Josep Pique i Camps, said the company makes decisions
``without the intervention of the Spanish government.''
	   He said such a purchase would be a good example of the
internationalization he was promoting during his tour of Australia
but reiterated that it was not a government matter.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Fair and transparent rules that support
competition are crucial to opening telecommunications markets,
according to the draft declaration prepared for a Pacific Rim
ministerial conference that opened Wednesday.
	   Developing countries in Asia and Latin America earn a lot of
money from monopoly telephone services and have resisted letting
market forces set the prices for cross-border voice and data
transmission.
	   They also worry about controlling foreign companies' hookups to
national networks of telephone poles and fiber-optic cables. More
developed countries say some of these concerns are merely excuses
to limit competition.
	   ``Ministers recognize that it is crucial to establish fair and
transparent interconnection and access arrangements to support
competitive service provision,'' said a draft of ``The Singapore
Declaration,'' to be adopted when the meeting ends.
	   While some delegates to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meeting of telecommunications and information ministers
continued to call for flexibility and consensus in setting prices
and rules, the draft declaration indicated that they were ready to
agree that fair competition benefits users.
	   The draft also calls for an action plan to promote electronic
commerce within APEC, and adoption of the first agreement whereby
telephone manufacturers can test their products once, and have the
certification accepted by importing countries without further
charges and delays.
	   The draft declaration, obtained by The Associated Press, directs
officials of the 18 APEC countries to create ``a flexible,
non-prescriptive framework'' of interconnection arrangements ``that
promotes fair and effective competition in the market and delivers
benefits to users.''
	   The United States has said it will unilaterally set low prices
for international telephone and computer transmissions if there is
no global agreement soon.
	   The draft also directs APEC officials to identify price
benchmarks and negotiation time frames.
	   The issue involves a foreign or multinational company trying to
connect to the communications network in another country to provide
new, better or cheaper services than national providers do.
	   ``Enabling interconnection is really about enabling competitors
to enter the telecom market,'' said William Kennard, head of the
U.S. Federal Communications Commission.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Candidate countries that attend the meetings are
Peru, Russia and Vietnam.

Second bomb explodes in Tehran, no injuries reported 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tensions mounted Wednesday, a day after two
bomb explosions and an attempted attack at government sites killed
at least two people.
	   State-run radio reported a bomb explosion at a government
building in northern Tehran late Tuesday, but did not say if there
were any casualties or give the cause of the blast. It did not
identify the government building.
	   The attack came only hours after a bomb exploded at the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's office in Tehran, in which police said
two people were killed and as many injured.
	   The radio said another attempted attack by ``saboteurs'' at the
headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Tuesday was
foiled by security men, but gave no other details. It said the
perpetrators fled.
	   Meanwhile, sources said that police evacuated guests and staff
at the Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran early Wednesday following a
bomb threat made by a caller. No bomb was found at the hotel, which
is close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   A police official at the scene said the explosion at the
Prosecutor's Office was caused by a bomb placed in a briefcase.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tuesday's blast
was caused by explosives and indicated that the material was being
brought to the court as evidence in a case under investigation when
it went off accidentally.
	   But Tehran television and radio only reported an explosion,
without specifying if it was a bomb or saying whether there were
any casualties.
	   The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group claimed
responsibility for the earlier blast in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press, saying the bomb had killed ``scores of torturers
and interrogators.''
	   However, the scene outside the building _ relaxing firemen and
little activity among the police _ appeared to contradict that
claim.
	   The Revolutionary Prosecutor's Office is responsible for
catching and trying Iranians opposed to the 1979 Islamic revolution
that installed the clergy's rule.
	   The Mujahedeen said the attack was in retaliation for the death
of eight of its members last November by the prosecutor's office.
	   Bombings are rare in Tehran where security is tightly
controlled. The last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago
when two devices went off in a commercial district but caused no
fatalities. Those explosions remain a mystery.
	   The explosions come as Iran is gripped by an intensifying power
struggle between the moderate faction of President Mohammad Khatami
and hard-line opponents who oppose his social and political
reforms.
	   Their rivalry has led to large public demonstrations in Tehran
and other cities in recent weeks that have sometimes turned
violent.

Emirates flies 40 tons of aid to Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A plane carrying 40 tons
of medicine and medical equipment left for Iraq Wednesday, a
spokesman for the Red Crescent society said.
	   Another plane carrying an additional 40 tons of aid will leave
Friday, said the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The goods were collected by the Red Crescent Society, the
Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, which has sent more than 22
million dirhams (dlrs 6 million) worth of aid to Iraq since 1996,
the group said.
	   A number of Red Crescent officials will fly Wednesday to the
Iraqi capital Baghdad to help distribute the aid.
	   The charity organization has said it plans to open an office in
Baghdad by the end of the year to coordinate the distribution of
humanitarian aid.
	   The Emirates has sent six planes to Iraq in the past six months
carrying food, medicine and clothing, the official Emirates News
Agency said.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions bar it from exporting oil, except for a
limited quantity under U.N. supervision, and also prohibit direct
flights to the country. The United Nations has to approve
humanitarian flights.
	   Arab states have recently increased their shipments of aid to
Iraq, reflecting widespread opposition to the sanctions among their
populations.
	   The U.N. Security Council says the sanctions will not be lifted
until Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi government says at least 1.5 million deaths during the
past seven years have been caused by shortages brought about by the
sanctions. The U.N. Children's Fund says that 960,000 Iraqi
children are suffering from malnutrition.

Three more suspects arrested in Europe-wide roundup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police on Wednesday arrested three more
suspects believed linked to Muslim militants plotting a terrorist
attack around the World Cup. The raid follows a Europe-wide roundup
of scores of suspects.
	   Authorities seized documents during the morning arrests, but no
arms or explosives were found, police said on customary anonymity.
	   The arrests completed the list of suspects in an investigation
led by anti-terrorist Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere. The three can be
held up to four days without judicial action.
	   Altogether 15 people in France have been placed under formal
investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for allegedly
plotting a terrorist attack.
	   Last week police in France, Belgium, Italy, Germany and
Switzerland arrested at least 88 people. They confiscated about
dlrs 150,000 in cash, a computer, documents and videocassettes _
including a video showing a training session for Algerian
militants.
	   But authorities seized neither weapons nor explosives in those
roundups either, French police sources said.
	   Police said the raids targeted networks loyal to Hassan Hattab,
leader of an Armed Islamic Group faction, who reportedly wants to
bring the Algerian conflict to Europe.
	   Algerian militants fighting a 6-year-old insurgency have staged
terrorist attacks in France to pressure Paris to cut its ties with
the military-backed government of the petroleum-rich North African
nation.

Blatter: `no problem' personally with rival Johansson 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss FIFA presidential hopeful Sepp
Blatter had conciliatory words for his Swedish rival Lennart
Johansson in a magazine interview published Wednesday.
	   ``Personally I have no problem with him, but people around him
are putting him under pressure,'' FIFA general secretary Blatter
was quoted as saying in the Swiss weekly Schweizer Illustrierte.
	   That pressure was leading UEFA President Johansson, the only
other candidate to take over the presidency of world soccer's
governing body, to say things that ``have nothing to do with fair
play,'' he continued.
	   The 198-member FIFA Congress, meeting Monday in Paris, will
choose a successor to Joao Havelange, the Brazilian who has
directed the sport through 24 years of unprecedented commercial
success.
	   The election brings to an end a bitter battle between the two
rivals.
	   Blatter was confident of victory, but cautioned that ``I can
only win if I'm supported on all continents.''
	   ``The campaign is costing 200,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 138,000).
I'm paying that myself,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Foreign
patrons who don't want to be named'' are supplying a private jet
for short journeys, he added.
	   Johansson, 68, was the only candidate to succeed Havelange until
Blatter officially declared his intentions in late March.
	   Blatter, 62, is promising players, coaches, referees and
national associations a greater say in the running of the game.
	   Johansson wants more openness in FIFA and more power to the
regional confederations. He has criticized Havelange for being
dictatorial.
	   He also accused Blatter of misusing his job to secretly campaign
for the presidency and was furious that Blatter declared his
intentions so late.

Australia criticized for refusing East Timorese refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Portuguese officials on Wednesday
criticized Australia for rejecting refugee applications from a East
Timorese asylum seeker on the grounds that he can obtain Portuguese
citizenship.
	   Australia's refugee tribunal and an appeal court had refused
asylum to East Timorese Jong Kim Koe, saying that he can apply for
Portuguese nationality, as East Timor was a former Portuguese
colony.
	   In a strongly worded statement, the Portuguese embassy in
Canberra said Wednesday that its country's citizenship laws were
only for people who freely chose to become Portuguese nationals.
	   ``Portuguese nationality laws were not designed to force the
assimilation of East Timorese people in the Portuguese state, but
to positively provide them with the right of exercising a free
choice on what concerns their nationality until self-determination
is settled in the territory,'' the statement said.
	   ``The finding on Mr. Koe's case can only be interpreted as a
denial of responsibilities towards East Timorese persons from
Australian authorities,'' it said.
	   Koe is one of many East Timorese who have been refused refugee
status in Australia on the grounds that they are eligible for both
the citizenship and protection of Portugal.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year. Australia is the only nation to recognize the
incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Immigration Minister
Phillip Ruddock did not comment on the communique.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's main human rights watchdog
Wednesday said at least 1,188 people died in rioting that led to
the resignation of autocratic President Suharto last month.
	   The figure is more than twice as high as official estimates made
by the military, which the National Human Rights Commission, or
Komnasham, accused of doing too little, too late to quell the
violence and save lives.
	   ``Komnasham has received quantitative reports that there was an
excessive material loss because of the riotings, including ... the
killings of 1,188 people and 101 injuries along with some cases of
rape,'' the commission said in a report.
	   It said 40 shopping centers, 2,479 shop-houses and 1,604 shops
were attacked, burned or looted, along with 1,119 automobiles,
1,026 private homes and 383 offices.
	   The commission did not provide a breakdown of the death toll,
but said it was based on reports in Jakarta and other parts of the
country from May 12-25.
	   It noted that security forces had failed to anticipate signs
that rioting would erupt. Moreover, when the violence started
``there were no signs of serious efforts by the security forces to
prevent the spread of the rioting.''
	   The 25-member commission urged the government of new President
B.J. Habibie to ``thoroughly investigate security apparatus for
letting, not preventing or immediately dealing with the riots.''
	   It also called for an inquiry into allegations that much of the
violence had been the work of ``well-organized groups who started
the rioting and burnings.''
	   In a three-page statement, the commission noted that members of
the ethnic Chinese community were frequent targets in the unrest.
	   Although Chinese make up only a fraction of Indonesia's 202
million population, they dominate commerce and industry, and have
been made into scapegoats for the country's worst economic crisis
in three decades.
	   The commission was set up by the Suharto regime but has earned a
reputation for independence in its investigation of human rights
abuses.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Fair and transparent rules that support

Ad agency withdraws Hitler potato chip commercials, posters campaign terminated

By PATRICK McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency Wednesday
terminated a TV-and-poster campaign using images of Nazi dictator
Adolf Hitler to sell potato chips following protests that the ads
were repugnant.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai office of the Chicago-based Leo
Burnett agency, issued a statement reiterating apologies over the
ads and said they were ``never intended to cause any ill feeling.''
	   Commercials will be withdrawn from television immediately and
the more complicated removal of posters from thousands of tuk-tuks,
the three-wheeled motorized taxis plying Bangkok's streets, will be
completed by Sunday.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy, praised the
agency for killing the ads once they became aware of how offensive
they were.
	   ``We're happy with this action,'' Nil said. ``If they had
realized the real meaning to people like us and other victims of
the Nazis, they would never have started in the first place.''
	   Nil said that the company's ``vigorous response shows there was
really no bad intention.''
	   Israeli officials viewed the ads as morally unacceptable, saying
Hitler should not be used as a means to make money.
	   Simone Wheeler, a spokeswoman for Leo Burnett, said no decision
had been taken yet on how to replace the withdrawn ads.
	   The commercial for X potato chips, targeted at Thai teen-agers,
depicts Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman who casts a
spell on him as he eats the chips, hoping to change his evil ways.
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   Leo Burnett said the ads, shown only in Thailand, were meant to
show the world would be a better place if happiness prevailed. The
chips are made by Food Processing Co. Ltd., a Thai firm.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok apologized for the ads Sunday and had been
discussing the campaign with its client for the past few days. They
agreed to withdraw the campaign from all media.
	   ``The agency acknowledges Hitler as one of history's most
despicable dictators and never intended to suggest otherwise,'' the
statement said.
	   Nil has said the controversy should raise awareness about Hitler
among Thais. Consciousness about the Nazis is somewhat less in
Asia, where their armies did not reach, than in the West.
	   Thailand has in the past expressed outrage over the use of
people dressed as Buddhist monks in advertisements. Buddhism is the
country's dominant religions and monks are generally revered.

Telfer agrees with `soft' Scots tag 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Scotland rugby coach Jim Telfer has
agreed with an opponent's assessment that his Down Under touring
team is soft.
	   Former Wallaby scrum half Steve Merrick labeled the Scots soft
and predicted they would get ``smashed'' in two tests against
Australia later this month.
	   His comments came after he played in a New South Wales Country
XV which lost to Scotland in Bathurst on Tuesday.
	   Instead of defending his inexperienced touring squad, Telfer
said Merrick was speaking the truth.
	   ``I think it may bring them back to earth a little bit,'' Telfer
said Wednesday. ``I think they'll be told the win in Bathurst
justified those words.''
	   Scotland plays New South Wales on Saturday in a match Telfer
described as ``another two or three rungs up the ladder.''
	   Telfer said he was used to criticism in the southern hemisphere
and that Saturday's match gave his squad a chance to earn some
respect.
	   ``It's a normal reaction when you're in southern hemisphere
countries,'' Telfer said. ``The British Lions were kicked into
touch last year all the time until they beat South Africa.
	   ``You don't gain respect in the southern hemisphere until you do
something. Until we do something, I don't think we deserve it.
	   ``The tour, as far as hard rugby, starts on Saturday, our next
five matches are top class matches. I consider on Saturday we are
playing a test match.''
	   Celtic rivalry prompted Telfer's only argument with Merrick,
taking offense at an unfavorable comparison to Wales. Merrick said
a match against Wales two years ago was a lot harder for the
Country outfit.
	   ``The one reference to the Welsh put us off a bit, because we
don't look at them as very hard either,'' Telfer said.
	   Meanwhile Glenn Metcalfe was named at fullback for Saturday's
match to continue his battle with Derrick Lee for the test role.
Lee played in the humiliating loss to Fiji last week.
	   Cameron Murray gets his chance at outside center and New
Zealander Gordon Simpson could earn his first Test cap with a
strong display at open side flanker.
	   Scotland team: Glenn Metcalfe, Craig Joiner, Rowen Shepherd,
Cameron Murray, Shaun Longstaff, Gregor Townsend, Bryan Redpath,
Eric Peters, Gordon Simpson, Rob Wainwright (captain), Stuart
Grimes, Scott Murray, Matthew Proudfoot, Gordon Bulloch, David
Hilton. Reserves: Derrick Lee, Duncan Hodge, Graeme Burns, Adam
Roxburgh, Stewart Campbell, Gordon McIlwham, Kevin McKenzie.

Dollar, stocks fall in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency;
ADDS trader comment in 5th graf
By MARTIN FACKLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell Wednesday amid lingering
pessimism in the outlook for Japan's economy, while the dollar
tumbled against the yen on speculation world central banks may move
to prop up the Japanese currency.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 207.45 points,
or 1.33 percent, to close at 15,347.00. On Tuesday, the index
gained 233.42 points, or 1.52 percent.
	   The dollar bought 137.76 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.49 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York
level of 138.83 yen overnight.
	   The decline by the benchmark stock average wiped out most of the
previous day's gains. And with Japan's economy seen by a growing
number of economists as entering outright recession, the prospects
for stocks remain grim.
	   ``Unless there is a resolution to Japan's economic problems, the
market trend will not change,'' said Kenji Karikomi, a deputy
general manager at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   The only active buyers on the market in recent sessions have
been government pension managers, who have purchased stocks on
behest of the Ministry of Finance in an effort to keep the Nikkei
average above the psychologically important 15,000-point level.
	   Traders said buying by pension funds boosted the market Tuesday.
But no sooner did they hold off Wednesday than prices came tumbling
right back down again.
	   ``There was a price-keeping operation Tuesday. Today, it has
completely stopped,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a managing director at
Chuo Securities Co.
	   Trading was thinner than average, with an estimated 358 million
shares changing hands on the first section. Declining issues
outnumbered gainers by more than 2-to-1.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,205.33.
The TOPIX rose 16.27 points, or 1.36 percent on Tuesday.
	   On the currency market, the dollar slipped below 138 yen for the
first time since May 28. At one point in the afternoon, the dollar
traded as low as 137.45 yen, down from an intraday high of 138.94
yen during morning trading.
	   The dollar tumbled as traders speculated that the Group of Seven
major industrialized nations may jointly intervene to help stem the
Japanese currency's slide.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin added to that speculation
late Tuesday when he confirmed that there will be a G-7 meeting
``sometime early next week.'' Rubin also told reporters that
Washington shares Tokyo's concern over the yen's weakness.
	   On Monday, the yen had hit a seven-year low against the dollar
as pessimism about the outlook for Japan's economy prompted
investors to shift funds out of yen and into the U.S. currency.
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond edged up to 1.150 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.130
percent. Its price fell to 112.43 yen from 112.59 yen.

Valmet four-month profit falls to dlrs 92 million 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Valmet, a leading world paper machinery
maker, posted a pretax profit of 415 million markkaa (dlrs 92
million) during the first four months of the year, down from 547
million markkaa in 1997.
	   The group's net sales, however, increased to 4 billion markkaa
(dlrs 895 million) from January to April, up from 3.7 billion
markkaa during the same period last year, Valmet said Wednesday.
	   Valmet received new orders worth 3.4 billion markkaa (dlrs 760
million) during the period, bringing the order backlog to 6.4
billion markkaa (dlrs 1.4 billion).
	   ``The group's financial position is good. It is estimated that
overall demand for paper and board products will continue to grow
in 1998,'' a company statement said. ``The European paper industry
has announced several large investment projects due to be placed
this year.''
	   ``Despite an uneven market environment, net sales are expected
to remain at a high level,'' Valmet said.
	   Valmet Automotive, which makes Saab cars and the Euro-Samara, a
modification of the Russian Lada, last year began producing
Porsche's popular Boxster model.
	   During the first third of the year, it assembled some 12,000
cars, bringing the unit's net sales to 275 million markkaa (dlrs 61
million), up from 184 million markkaa in 1997.
	   The Helsinki-based Valmet group is 20-percent owned by the
Finnish government. It employs 13,300 people worldwide, and is a
major producer of paper and board machines, as well as forest
industry equipment.

Arafat arrives in Oman to push for Arab summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived
here Wednesday to lobby for an Arab summit aimed at reviving the
stalled Middle East peace process, the official Omani News Agency
said.
	   Arafat is expected to meet later Wednesday with Omani leader
Sultan Qaboos, said the agency.
	   ``This visit comes in the middle of hard times for the peace
process because of the intransigence of (Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu and his government,'' Arafat said at the
airport upon his arrival. He accused Israel of not wanting to
implement agreements it reached with the Palestinians.
	   He said he viewed the agreements reached between the two sides
and sponsored by the United States and Russia as international
agreements and not bilateral agreements.
	   Netanyahu has said that he was not bound by agreements reached
between Palestinians and the previous government of slain Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Arafat has urged a summit to clearly blame Israel for the
stalemate in the negotiations. Israel-Palestinian talks have been
stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish
housing project in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Most Arab leaders have agreed to holding such a summit, but are
torn by their usual squabbles between those wanting a hard-line
stance against Israel and others espousing a more moderate line.
	   The hard-liners want to make good on a warning issued at a 1996
summit that Arab states pull back from ties with Israel unless
Netanyahu kept to pledges made in peace pacts with Palestinians.
	   Oman is one of the few Arab countries with ties to Israel.
Although it has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but the two
states have trade missions in each other's countries.

South Korea's Hyundai cuts chip production 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Electronics Co. temporarily
stopped making computer memory chips Wednesday to help ease a
global supply glut and shore up falling chip prices.
	   The move by Hyundai, South Korea's No. 2 chip maker, was
expected to be followed by Samsung and LG. The three South Korean
firms supply 40 percent of the world's memory chips, called Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips.
	   Hyundai said its plant outside Seoul will remain idle until next
Tuesday. The company normally produces 19 million 16-megabit DRAM
chips and eight million 64-megabit DRAM chips a month, or 10
percent of the world supply.
	   ``We hope that our decision will encourage other chip makers
around the world to follow suit,'' Hyundai said in a statement.
	   Samsung Electronics Co., the world's No. 1 DRAM chip maker, said
it also was considering cutting production. LG Semicon Co., South
Korea's third largest chip maker, also had cutback plans but
refused to disclose details.
	   South Korean chip makers have suffered sharp drops in prices
that have eroded their earnings.
	   In the first quarter of this year, South Korea sold its
64-megabit chips for around dlrs 9 each, a price industry officials
say was barely enough to cover the production cost. Around this
time last year, it was getting between dlrs 15 and dlrs 30 apiece,
depending on chip types.
	   Japanese and U.S. chip makers have charged that South Korea's
rapid expansion of facilities resulted in the drastic price cuts.
South Korea put the blame on such new market entries as Taiwan.
	   Memory chips store operating instructions for electronic
products such as personal computers.
	   In 1997, South Korea exported dlrs 17.5 billion worth of
semiconductors, or 12.8 percent of the country's total exports.

In desperate bid to raise cash, Russia offers rare treasury bills 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos planned
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government issued rare one-week
treasury bills Wednesday in a desperate attempt to refill its
drained coffers and stabilize its turbulent financial markets.
	   The move is one of a number of measures the Kremlin hopes will
resolve Russia's financial crisis, which was marked by a steep drop
in the stock market last week and threatened to trigger a costly
devaluation of the ruble.
	   However, the stock exchange regained significant ground Tuesday,
rising 12 percent to wipe out the previous day's 10 percent drop.
That climb continued Wednesday, with the market rising more than 5
percent by mid-day.
	   Moreover, the ruble has been steady in recent days without major
support from Central Bank, which says it has plenty of reserves
left to prevent a run on the currency.
	   All together, the Russia's stock market is down about 50 percent
from the beginning of the year _ the world's worst performance and
a sharp change from the previous year's record growth of 98
percent.
	   The new treasury bills offered Wednesday are designed to raise
quick cash so Russia can keep up with payments on its existing debt
and reassure investors that it will not default.
	   The government has a serious cash flow problem, largely because
it has been unable to create an effective tax collection system. As
a result it has borrowed heavily to finance the resulting federal
budget deficit.
	   Nonetheless there has been too little cash in the system to pay
state workers and pensioners on time, a situation that led to a
wave of labor strikes last week.
	   The government has blamed those strikes, combined with lingering
nerves over the Asian financial crisis and a drop in world prices
for Russia's main exports of oil and gas, for triggering last
week's stock collapse.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will need a rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund or its colleagues in the G-8.
Deputy finance ministers from the so-called Group of Eight
industrialized democracies were to confer on the issue by telephone
Wednesday.
	   But Kremlin officials have insisted that they would prefer to
fix their problems themselves, by reducing government spending and
improving tax collection.
	   Wednesday's auction is the first time Russia has ever offered
one-week treasury bills _ an extremely short term. Most Russian
treasury bills are for several months or a year, while terms in the
West can reach 30 years.
	   While the auction may help Russia's financial health in the
short term, analysts say the only long-term solution is to
strengthen the entire revenue system, especially tax collection.
	   Russia has no taxpaying tradition and its stiff tax rates have
increased incentives for both companies and individuals to evade
them. Last year, only 5 million of the nation's 147 million
citizens paid taxes.

Supervisory board proposes new head for central bank 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ The Bank of Finland's supervisory
council on Wednesday proposed Matti Vanhala as the bank's new
governor, to succeed Sirkka Hamalainen who joined the European
Central Bank.
	   The supervisory council, which is appointed by Parliament, voted
5-4 in Vanhala's favor. The government is expected to propose
Vanhala's appointment for President Martti Ahtisaari's approval
Friday.
	   Vanhala, 52, with a 25-year career in the bank, has been a
member of its board since 1992. From 1977 to 1980, he was a member
of the International Monetary Fund's board, including its director.
	   Hamalainen, who had been governor of the central bank since
1992, resigned when she was elected to the six-member board of the
European Central Bank which started work June 1.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant labor group said Wednesday
it will go ahead with plans for a nationwide strike next week,
citing a breakdown in talks with the government aimed at halting
growing layoffs.
	   The decision by the maverick Confederation of Korean Trade
Unions raised concern that labor unrest may persist in South Korea
in the midst of its deepening economic crisis.
	   It also chilled President Kim Dae-jung's hopes of attracting
foreign investment during his visit to the United States next week.
Kim has stressed the importance of labor peace to his efforts.
	   ``The government is too much uncompromising, especially on
layoffs,'' said Chung Sung-hee, a spokesman of the confederation,
which claims a membership of 500,000 in car, shipbuilding and other
heavy industries.
	   Chung said overnight talks with the government to avert the
strike broke down because of what he called the government's
unwillingness to accept the confederation's demand for a halt to
widespread layoffs.
	   He said the strike, the second in two weeks, will begin on June
10 as scheduled, joined by 130,000 car workers, shipbuilders and
office clerks from state-run companies. The group organized a
similar two-day strike last week.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Major political parties from across Hong Kong's
spectrum told the government on Wednesday that it wasn't doing
enough to stimulate the recession-bound economy, and reached
consensus on their own six-point program.
	   Held only a week and a half after elections, a special meeting
included parties that won more than two-thirds of the seats in the
new legislature. It included government critics, pro-business
parties that generally support the government, and grassroots
pro-China parties.
	   Their ability to bridge differences could mean that, despite
being controlled by pro-business and pro-China elites, the
legislature may give Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his
government a hard time on economic issues.
	   ``The government is wealthy,'' said Allen Lee, chairman of the
pro-business Liberal Party, who chaired the meeting. ``It's the
citizens who don't have money.''

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The opening of Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the
latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the
development.
	   Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. said it expects to begin
digging at the remote Jabiluka mining lease in the Northern
Territory this month, after the territorial government on Tuesday
signed authorizations allowing work to begin on the mine's entrance
and shaft.
	   But the company may be left with nothing but a hole in the
ground, as it goes ahead without having formal approvals to either
build a processing plant or to truck ore to an established mill at
its nearby Ranger mine.
	   ERA has been forced to consider building a second mill just 13
miles (22 km) from Ranger by Aboriginal landowners' refusal to
accept its preferred option, to transport the ore.
	   The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine, claiming it
will cause environmental and indirect cultural damage. But they are
bound by a 1983 contract approving the mill-on-site option.
	   Representatives of the Mirrar Aboriginal clan said Wednesday
they will seek a court order blocking the territory government's
approval until an environmental approval process for the on-site
mill plan is completed.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine export growth slowed in
April, dropping to 10 percent on an annual basis from 24 percent in
March, the government said Wednesday.
	   Previously, the Philippines had been able to avoid the export
growth slowdown that has plagued much of Asia since the currency
crisis struck last July.
	   On a month-to-month basis, exports actually fell 7.3 percent in
April to dlrs 2.29 billion from dlrs 2.47 billion in March, the
National Statistics Office said.
	   Exports in April 1997 totaled dlrs 2.08 billion.
	   Electronics and components continued to dominate Philippine
exports, accounting for 53 percent of total shipments. Garments,
which continue to face stiff competition from other countries with
lower production costs, were next, followed by computer parts.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Unhappy with China's pace of developing a
jointly owned industrial park and township in Suzhou, the Singapore
government has set a five-year deadline to complete transfer of
technology and knowhow to Chinese managers, state-run television
reported Tuesday.
	   The report did not specify what would happen at the end of the
deadline.
	   The decision follows a visit last week to China, led by Deputy
Prime Minister Tony Tan, and including some of Singapore's top U.S.
business friends and investors in the China-Singapore Suzhou
Industrial Park.
	   The announcement on government-run television indicated the
Singaporean delegation did not get the cooperation they were
expecting from meetings with the Chinese last week. The Chinese had
already surprised Singapore and its investors by opening a rival
industrial park in the same underpopulated and undeveloped area,
and charging lower prices for land.
	   Four years into the project, there are concerns that the park _
65 percent owned by Singapore and 35 percent by the Chinese _ is
not commercially viable. Less than half of the 106 projects are
operating, although dlrs 3.2 billion has been invested.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency Wednesday
terminated a TV-and-poster campaign using images of Nazi dictator
Adolf Hitler to sell potato chips following protests that the ads
were repugnant.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai office of the Chicago-based Leo
Burnett agency, issued a statement reiterating apologies over the
ads and said they were ``never intended to cause any ill feeling.''
	   Commercials will be withdrawn from television immediately and
the more complicated removal of posters from thousands of tuk-tuks,
the three-wheeled motorized taxis plying Bangkok's streets, will be
completed by Sunday.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy, praised the
agency for killing the ads once they became aware of how offensive
they were.
	   ``We're happy with this action,'' Nil said. ``If they had
realized the real meaning to people like us and other victims of
the Nazis, they would never have started in the first place.''

Croatia's coach announces roster _ without Boksic 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia will have to do without striker
Alen Boksic at the World Cup, along with other veterans left off
the roster that was announced Wednesday.
	   Boksic will miss the tournament because of knee surgery. With
striker Igor Cvitanovic eliminated by coach Miroslav Ciro Blazevic
for refusing to follow orders, the roster showed only four
strikers.
	   Blazevic's ``trump card'' is Davor Suker, who plays for Real
Madrid.
	   Also off the list were strikers Alen Peternac of Valladolid of
Spain and Boris Zivkovic of Bayer Leverkusen, whom Blazevic
initially called as substitutes to Boksic and Cvitanovic.
	   Defenders Stjepan Tomas will miss the World Cup too, due to a
torn ligament. Daniel Saric, a potential substitute, also was not
on the roster.
	   Boksic's absence, along with other injuries will hurt Croatia
against Japan, Jamaica and Argentina, its Group H opponents.
	   In addition, the team's self-esteem was hurt last week, when it
lost 1-2 to Slovakia in the World Cup warmup game.
	   The team plays another friendly match later in the day against
Iran.
	   ``That match is extremely important because only victory can
boost our self-confidence,'' Blazevic said.
	   Croatia's final roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Drazen Ladic, Marijan Mrmic, Vladimir Vasilj.
	   Defenders: Goran Juric, Zvonimir Soldo, Slaven Bilic, Igor
Stimac, Dario Simic, Igor Tudor, Robert Jarni, Ante Seric.
	   Midfielders: Zvonimir Boban, Aljosa Asanovic, Robert Prosinecki,
Silvio Maric, Krunoslav Jurcic, Zoran Mamic, Mario Stanic.
	   Strikers: Davor Suker, Goran Vlaovic, Petar Krpan, Adrian
Kozniku.

Japan's premier proposes nuclear non-proliferation forum 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will propose convening an international forum
on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in the wake of recent
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, a Japanese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will formally announce plans for a
meeting of experts from around the world on the non-proliferation
issue in a speech scheduled for Thursday, the spokesman said.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto preempted that announcement
when he mentioned the proposal early Wednesday while appearing
before an upper house of parliament ad hoc committee.
	   Preparations will begin soon on convening the forum later this
summer, possibly in the city of Hiroshima, Japanese newspapers
said.
	   Japan, the only country ever to suffer a nuclear attack, has
been among the harshest critics of India and Pakistan after those
nations carried out nuclear weapons tests last month. It has
punished both countries by suspending economic aid.
	   The foreign ministry official, who declined to be named, said
that the site and date of the forum has not been decided yet, but
indicated it may not be held until autumn.
	   On Tuesday, forty-six countries in the Conference on
Disarmament, including Japan and the United States, demanded that
India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and join
in the global move to eliminate the weapons.

Tough talk ahead of second-round negotiations Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Threatening a long and devastating strike, Air
France's leading pilots' union was talking tough after the first
round of negotiations in a three-day-old walkout already disrupting
some World Cup preparations.
	   The strike at state-owned Air France _ the World Cup's official
carrier _ was a serious embarrassment to the French government,
which also faced a Paris transit and national train strike
Thursday.
	   Talks were resume at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday, seven days
before the championship begins. No progress was reported after the
first round Tuesday.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   After 5 1-2 hours of negotiations Tuesday inside Air France
headquarters at Charles de Gaulle Airport, union leader
Jean-Charles Corbet said the dispute ``will probably be long, it
will probably be tough. ... and devastating for the balance
sheet.''
	   Corbet, head of the SNPL union that represents most of the
airline's 3,200 pilots, accused the airline's president, Jean-Cyril
Spinetta, of ``contenting himself with renewing his demands''
during the talks.
	   While faced with a slated two-week walkout, Spinetta on
Wednesday morning said he remained ``firm on my objectives'' but
that ``on the means to reach them, we can and must discuss them.''
	   For the pilots, among the highest paid in the world, the company
wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs (dlrs
83 million) in pay cuts. But it's offered to eventually do away
with a two-tier salary schedule that pays less to new pilots.
	   Spinetta told Europe 1 radio he was ready to spend ``the
afternoon, the night and beyond'' to reach an agreement.
	   ``I can't imagine that the pilots, at the moment where the
world's eyes are turned to France for this great celebration that
is the World Cup, will paralyze the country,'' Spinetta said.
	   The carrier, which managed to report a profit in the last two
years, was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per
day during the strike that was forcing tens of thousands of people
worldwide to look for other ways to travel.
	   France's interior minister criticized the ``lack of
civic-mindedness'' of the pilots, saying he felt ``sadness, almost
shame.''
	   Because of the strike, Jean-Pierre Chevenement told Radio Monte
Carlo, France could show itself as a nation that can't organize a
world event anymore.''
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   But the U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday,
said it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines,
connecting to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses in France.

Opposition leader slams police ban on public gatherings 
</HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Warning that Malaysia could plunge
into ``a new dark age,'' the leader of the main opposition party
Wednesday slammed the police for banning three public meetings over
the past four days.
	   ``Has Malaysia suddenly descended into a police state in a
matter of days?'' said Lim Kit Siang, head of the opposition
Democratic Action Party.
	   In a statement, Lim alleged that police in riot gear Tuesday
disbanded a meeting organized by the DAP in village in the central
state of Malacca.
	   The party had applied for permission for the Pantai Kundor
gathering on May 22, Lim said, but the request was rejected one day
before it was scheduled to commence.
	   Police broke up the gathering while DAP was hosting a dinner for
its panel of speakers _ comprising leaders from four opposition
parties. It was not clear whether DAP had planned to go ahead with
its meeting.
	   On Tuesday, Kuala Lumpur police suddenly withdrew permission for
a meeting of residents to discuss the city's severe water
rationing. Over the weekend, police had disbanded a gathering of
lawyers at a city hotel, saying organizers hadn't obtained a
permit. Lim and his son were to speak at that meeting.
	   ``These high-handed and undemocratic police actions are ominous
signs that Malaysia is heading toward a police state,'' said a
joint statement by eight opposition leaders condemning the
disbanding of Tuesday's village meeting.
	   The police bans have been criticized by the opposition and human
rights groups.
	   ``We're just amazed at their paranoia,'' said Hamdan Adnan,
president of the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations.
	   Nearly 2 million residents of Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs have
faced water rationing for three months as the reservoirs hovered at
critical levels. Authorities have blamed the water shortage on
scant rains, but residents say it was a crisis caused by
mismanagement.
	   ``The right of consumers to assemble and discuss matters that
concern their day-to-day living is the most basic of democratic
rights in a civil society,'' said Ramdas Tikamdas, president of the
National Human Rights Society.
	   Lim, the opposition leader, urged the government to move toward
greater democratization in view of the recent developments in
Indonesia that led to President Suharto's ouster. ``Malaysian
government leaders are afraid of the Indonesian contagion, but they
must draw the right lessons.''
	   Police cited security concerns for disallowing the meeting, but
did not elaborate.
	   ``They are operating under the police act, section 27. If the
police chief has a strong reason to stop the meetings, he can,''
said police spokesman, Samsuddin Ali.

Indonesia's military chief wants end to condemnation of Suharto With Indonesia-Habibie Interview, Indonesia-Riot Toll 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with military blocking downtown intersection to stop
protesters, graf 9

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters shouted ``Hang
Suharto'' outside Parliament on Wednesday as Indonesia's military
chief appealed for a halt to ``out of control'' condemnation of the
ousted president.
	   Suharto, a former army general who turns 77 next Monday, faces
growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during three
decades in power.
	   In a television interview, new President B.J. Habibie urged
Indonesians not to dwell on the country's corrupt past and to focus
on economic recovery. With the economy expected to shrink by at
least 10 percent this year, the task is a daunting one.
	   Student protesters who helped dislodge Suharto accuse him of
deepening Indonesia's financial crisis by exploiting state wealth.
The authoritarian leader quit May 21 amid campus demonstrations and
riots over price increases.
	   A government commission, meanwhile, said the death toll over
several days of riots in Jakarta in mid-May was 1,188, more than
double an estimate by the military. Many victims were looters
trapped in buildings set afire by arsonists.
	   In a report released Wednesday, the National Commission on Human
Rights also criticized the armed forces for failing to take prompt
action to prevent rioting.
	   About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied in a major highway
outside Parliament, demanding that Suharto be put on trial for
economic crimes. Soldiers closed off the road.
	   Chanting ``Reject Habibie,'' the protesters scoffed at their new
president's pledge to hold general elections in 1999, saying he was
a corrupt lackey of Suharto and should step aside. A close ally of
Suharto for decades, Habibie is bowing to popular demands for
democratic reform.
	   Later the military blocked off a major downtown intersection to
stop a convoy of about 20 busloads of protesters from staging a
demonstration at Jakarta's National Monument, adjacent to the
Presidential Palace.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, said the nation of 202
million people should pardon Suharto because he boosted economic
growth and averted chaos by relinquishing power.
	   ``Lately, condemnation and harassment against the former
president and his family have been exaggerated and, in some cases,
have gotten out of control,'' said Wiranto, a former personal aide
to Suharto.
	   ``The armed forces will take necessary measures to stop it,''
Wiranto said without elaborating.
	   The military is the most powerful institution in Indonesia,
which is beset by uncertainty about its political future. It is
doubtful that Habibie, who has a shaky power base, would make any
policy decisions without the backing of Wiranto.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network that was broadcast
Wednesday, Habibie argued against a painful investigation of
misdeeds that could divide the nation.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop?'' Habibie said. ``So I think it is not worthwhile to dip
into the past. I have to look to the future and create a better
life ... for the people.''
	   In a separate interview with the New York Times, Habibie said
Indonesians should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice against the
former leader.
	   State prosecutors have launched an inquiry into corruption under
the old government, including complaints that Suharto's family
abused its influence to build huge business empires. However,
critics doubt they will aggressively pursue the former president.
	   Earlier this week, opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri urged
people to stop denouncing Suharto, who rose to power in the 1960s
by edging aside her father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno.
	   Still, sentiment against Suharto was strong among about 200
supporters of Megawati who joined students outside Parliament to
demand government action to help the poor.
	   ``Everybody knows he's corrupt so the case must be processed
legally,'' said protester Daulat Sidautar. ``It will give an
example for the future of Indonesia.''

An overnight summary of Caribbean news GUYANA: Long-awaited audit says election was fair 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ In a blow to Guyana's main opposition
party, a Caribbean Community audit team said Tuesday that December
elections which touched off race riots in this South American
country were fair.
	   Audited results varied ``only marginally'' from official results
of the Dec. 15 election, won by President Janet Jagan's People's
Progressive Party, said Caricom team leader Ulric Cross.
	   Guyana's elections commissioner had declared Mrs. Jagan, a U.S.
expatriate, the winner with 56 percent of votes to 42 percent for
ex-President Desmond Hoyte's People's National Congress.
	   Hoyte denounced alleged vote fraud, and opposition street
protests after the elections led to race riots that shut down
schools and businesses. Dozens were hurt.
  BAHAMAS: Chairman of disgraced gold company hospitalized
	   TORONTO (AP) _ David Walsh, the disgraced president and chief
executive of Bre-X Minerals Ltd., iss hospitalized after he
suffered a heart attack during the weekend, the Canadian Press news
service reported.
	   Officials with Doctor's Hospital in Nassau confirmed late
Tuesday that Walsh was registered as a patient, but refused to give
any other details.
	   Earlier, a Reuters report said the former Calgary mining
promoter was in critical condition.
	   Walsh, whose now-infamous company rose to fame on the strength
of an Indonesian gold find that was exposed last year as a fraud,
moved to the Bahamas after the scandal broke in March 1997. The
scam cost investors more than dlrs 3 billion.
  UNITED STATES: Cruise line will pay dlrs 9 million in fines
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The world's second largest cruise ship company
apologized Tuesday for illegally dumping oily bilge water from its
ships into the oceans and for trying to hide the crime by lying to
investigators and falsifying records.
	   Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. agreed to settle charges filed by
federal prosecutors in Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico, accusing
the cruise line of routinely dumping oil-contaminated water at sea.
	   The company agreed in federal court to pay dlrs 9 million in
fines _ the largest environmental fine ever against a cruise
company _ and to serve 5 years of probation in which it will be
subject to a court-monitored environmental plan.
  NICARAGUA: President restricts offer to take Cubans
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A war of words between Cuba and
Nicaragua's fiercely anti-communist president is continuing to heat
up _ with Cubans trying to leave their homeland trapped in the
verbal cross fire.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman repeated Monday night that his
government is willing to accept 191 Cubans who fled by raft to the
Bahamas, but were then returned to Cuba last month. But, he said,
Nicaragua would not automatically accept other Cubans.
	   Cuba, meanwhile, has said it would allow anybody to go to
Nicaragua _ anybody but those specified by Aleman because they had
violated the law by leaving without government permission.
  VIRGIN ISLANDS: Customs agents, wholesaler convicted in gold import
scheme
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Two U.S. Customs Service
inspectors, a Miami jewelry wholesaler and three of its employees
were convicted of smuggling Italian gold smuggled into the United
States through the Virgin Islands.
	   A federal jury on Monday found all five people, and the
wholesaler _ New Ilan of Florida Inc. _ of trying to avoid millions
in import duties. Sentencing was set for Sept. 15.
	   Federal prosecutors charge the smuggling operation snuck into
this country about dlrs 14 million worth of jewelry _ through the
Caribbean, without paying import duty fees _ during a 22-month
period. Imported gold is subject to a 6.5 percent import duty.
  UNITED STATES: Coast guard stops cruise ship to Bahamas from
sailing
	   PORT CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ The Big Red Boat to the Bahamas was
kept in port along with more than 1,000 angry passengers when the
U.S. Coast Guard could not verify the Premier Cruises ship met new
fire codes.
	   The Coast Guard suspended cruises on the vessel Monday until it
is inspected. The 32-year-old ship was getting ready to sail to
Nassau and Port Lucaya in the Bahamas.
	   Inspectors were expected to examine the ship Wednesday and the
earliest it would be able to sail was Friday, Coast Guard spokesman
Tim Kaminski said Tuesday.
	   Premier Cruises officials were offered passengers free flights
home and vouchers for other cruise lines or future cruises. The
cruise line also offered to pay for rooms in area hotels.
  UNITED STATES: Lawyer defends company selling cheap Caribbean
trips
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The lawyer for a telemarketing company accused
of duping customers about cut-rate vacations told a judge Tuesday
that most people are satisfied with their trips to Florida and the
Bahamas.
	   The Federal Trade Commission has accused Commonwealth Marketing
Group Inc. of Hopwood, Pennsylvania of promising customers luxury
hotel rooms and cruises but delivering worn rooms and five- to
six-hour ferry rides on unsteady boats.
	   ``We've all seen telemarketing cases where people are selling
air,'' defense lawyer William Manifesto said. ``This is not that
case, or we wouldn't have an 80 percent approval rating.''
Consumers in 29 states, Mexico, Canada and England have complained
to authorities about CMG.
	   Manifesto asked U.S. District Judge William Standish to lift a
restraining order that has temporarily shut down the company.
  U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Government eases barge rule
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The government on
Tuesday relaxed a proposed rule that prohibited commuters from
accompanying their cars on the ferry trip between two of the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   The rule, approved by the Public Services Commission last week,
outraged residents of St. John who commute to the larger island of
St. Thomas. The ruling required drivers to put their cars on a
cargo ferry, then board a separate passenger ferry.
	   After a meeting between Gov. Roy Schneider and commission
chairman Walter Challenger on Tuesday morning, Schneider
spokeswoman Jeanette Millin said the rule had been changed to allow
the driver and one passenger to accompany each car.
	   Commission members said they were trying to prevent travelers
from packing into cars to save money on tickets.

	   In a television interview, new President B.J. Habibie urged
Indonesians not to dwell on the country's corrupt past and to focus
on economic recovery. With the economy expected to shrink by at
least 10 percent this year, the task is a daunting one.
	   Student protesters who helped dislodge Suharto accuse him of
deepening Indonesia's financial crisis by exploiting state wealth.
The authoritarian leader quit May 21 amid campus demonstrations and
riots over price increases.
	   A government commission, meanwhile, said the death toll over
several days of riots in Jakarta in mid-May was 1,188, more than
double an estimate by the military. Many victims were looters
trapped in buildings set afire by arsonists.
	   In a report released Wednesday, the National Commission on Human
Rights also criticized the armed forces for failing to take prompt
action to prevent rioting.
	   About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied in a major highway
outside Parliament, demanding that Suharto be put on trial for
economic crimes. Soldiers closed off the road.
	   Chanting ``Reject Habibie,'' the protesters scoffed at their new
president's pledge to hold general elections in 1999, saying he was
a corrupt lackey of Suharto and should step aside. A close ally of
Suharto for decades, Habibie is bowing to popular demands for
democratic reform.
	   Later the military blocked off a major downtown intersection to
stop a convoy of about 20 busloads of protesters from staging a
demonstration at Jakarta's National Monument, adjacent to the
Presidential Palace.
	   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, said the nation of 202
million people should pardon Suharto because he boosted economic
growth and averted chaos by relinquishing power.
	   ``Lately, condemnation and harassment against the former
president and his family have been exaggerated and, in some cases,
have gotten out of control,'' said Wiranto, a former personal aide
to Suharto.
	   ``The armed forces will take necessary measures to stop it,''
Wiranto said without elaborating.
	   The military is the most powerful institution in Indonesia,
which is beset by uncertainty about its political future. It is
doubtful that Habibie, who has a shaky power base, would make any
policy decisions without the backing of Wiranto.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network that was broadcast
Wednesday, Habibie argued against a painful investigation of
misdeeds that could divide the nation.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop?'' Habibie said. ``So I think it is not worthwhile to dip
into the past. I have to look to the future and create a better
life ... for the people.''
	   In a separate interview with the New York Times, Habibie said
Indonesians should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice against the
former leader.
	   State prosecutors have launched an inquiry into corruption under
the old government, including complaints that Suharto's family
abused its influence to build huge business empires. However,
critics doubt they will aggressively pursue the former president.
	   Earlier this week, opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri urged
people to stop denouncing Suharto, who rose to power in the 1960s
by edging aside her father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno.
	   Still, sentiment against Suharto was strong among about 200
supporters of Megawati who joined students outside Parliament to
demand government action to help the poor.
	   ``Everybody knows he's corrupt so the case must be processed
legally,'' said protester Daulat Sidautar. ``It will give an
example for the future of Indonesia.''

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ New Zealand won the toss and elected to
bat in a rain delayed second Test versus Sri Lanka at the Galle
International Stadium Wednesday.
	   Play began after a 4 1/2 hour delay. More than 10,000 spectators
packed the stadium to see the first Test match to be played in the
ancient port city. Another 1,500 people lined the stone ramparts of
the nearby 17th century Dutch fort for a free bird's eye view.
	   As expected, Sri Lanka recalled experienced middle order bat
Hashan Tillekeratne and off-spinner Kumar Dharmasena, in place of
all-rounder Ruwan Kalpage and young spinner Malinga Bandara.
	   Injured New Zealand fast bowler Simon Doull was replaced by
left-arm paceman Shayne O'Conner.

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ One of apartheid's most notorious
killers testified Wednesday in former President P.W. Botha's trial,
putting the death squad commander face-to-face with the last
hard-line leader of the apartheid state.
	   Former police Col. Eugene de Kock was testifying for the
prosecution. Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a body probing apartheid
crimes, but it has turned into a hearing on his possible complicity
in state-sanctioned killings and violence.
	   De Kock carried out the 1988 bombing of Khotso House, the
Johannesburg headquarters of the South African Council of Churches,
which opposed apartheid. A former head of South Africa's police has
said Botha ordered the bombing.

Deposed Afghan president says aid too slow to quake victims

<TEXT>
	   SHARI BASURKH, Afghanistan (AP) _ As survivors in the remotest
regions still waited Wednesday for help to arrive, Afghanistan's
deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani said the international
response to the deadly earthquake was too slow.
	   Rabbani went by helicopter to Shari-Basurkh -- one of the
hardest hit areas -- on Tuesday to see the devastation caused by
Saturday's magnitude-6.9 quake and to settle a dispute among rebel
commanders who control the region.
	   The northern-based alliance established to stop the Taliban
religious army from consolidating its hold on Afghanistan has been
fraught with internal disputes. Several of them have turned
violent.
	   The feuding comes as residents of the area were trying to dig
themselves from the rubble caused by the deadly quake that killed
as many as 5,000 people, wiped out entire villages and left as many
as 60,000 people homeless.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross have been coordinating
relief efforts, attempting to make several many helicopter runs a
day from the provincial capital, Faisabad, to remote villages to
pick up the wounded, and to drop off blankets, plastic sheeting and
tents.
	   ``We are trying to get in more helicopters ... this is where the
bottleneck has been,'' said Philip Spoerri, a Red Cross spokesman
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   Until now he said the priority has been to get the wounded out
and medical supplies to the hardest hit areas and it hasn't been
easy. On Wednesday he said 3.5 tons of medical supplies were to be
sent to Faisabad from Pakistan.
	   Much of the area is inaccessible by road.
	   In Shari Basurkh, near the epicenter, half the village was
flattened by the violent shaking that residents said lasted four
minutes. The quake struck during the late morning when most of the
men were in the fields, which is why aid workers say the bulk of
the wounded are women, old men and children -- all of whom had been
in their homes at the time of the temblor.
	   In a makeshift clinic set up in an elementary school, 60 of the
injured lie side by side. A baby on an intravenous drip screams
next to a woman whose face is covered in yellow bruises.
	   Most people here haven't eaten since the earthquake hit. Afraid
to stay inside, they are terrified that another killer quake could
be on the way.
	   The area has been rattled by aftershocks almost daily since the
quake struck.
	   The United Nations has put out an appeal for helicopters
worldwide saying it has the aid ready to distribute to the victims
of the earthquake but limited means to get it to them.
	   The rugged mountain region has no roads leading from the
Badakshan capital of Faisabad to Shari Basurkh or scores of other
villages that lay in the quake's path.
	   ``Shari Basurkh is one of the hardest areas to reach,'' said
Spoerri.
	   Saturday's quake follows another deadly earthquake that struck
last February killing as many as 2,300 people and leaving thousands
more homeless.
	   Earlier fears by the U.N. of a fuel shortage for their three
borrowed helicopters were alleviated after they discovered 20
barrels of fuel in Faisabad. At the airport in Faisabad helicopters
were being loaded up with plastic sheeting, bamboo splints, cakes
of soap, food and water.

Indonesia's military chief wants end to condemnation of Suharto With Indonesia-Habibie Interview, Indonesia-Riot Toll

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters shouted ``Hang
Suharto'' outside Parliament and staged a rowdy protest in a main
street on Wednesday, ignoring an appeal by Indonesia's military
chief to halt to ``out of control'' condemnation of the ousted
president.
	   Suharto, a former army general who turns 77 next Monday, faces
growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during three
decades in power.
	   About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied in a highway outside
Parliament, demanding that Suharto be put on trial for economic
crimes. Soldiers closed off the road.

democratic reform.
	   Unimpressed, the students shouted: ``Reject Habibie.''
	   Later the military blocked off a major downtown intersection to
stop about 20 busloads of protesters from staging a demonstration
at Jakarta's National Monument, across from the Presidential
Palace.
	   Hundreds of students sang songs and mouthed slogans. Some danced
around the city's Welcome Mounment fountain as soldiers, police,
shoppers and guests at adjacant five-star hotels looked on.
	   Traffic was brought to a standstill.
	   Earlier in a television interview, Habibie urged Indonesians not
to dwell on the country's corrupt past and to focus on economic
recovery. With the economy expected to shrink by at least 10

Eritrea says Ethiopia troops attack Eritrean territory 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea charged that Ethiopian troops
attacked Eritrean positions in Ambesete Geleba early Wednesday with
tanks and heavy artillery.
	   Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Andemicael Kahsai said no
details were immediately available on casualties.
	   The ministry called the attack ``a new and dangerous
escalation'' of the border crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia and
said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on Eritrean
positions.
	   On May 13 Ethiopia first made public the border dispute, calling
on Eritrea to withdraw from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea has consistently denied it has moved into Ethiopia and
on Wednesday repeated a call for a total demilitarization of border
areas and outside mediation to solve the dispute.
	   Andemicael called the Ethiopian demand that Eritrean troops
withdraw from disputed territory ``a stumbling block to any
progress.''
	   The ministry said Ambesete Geleba was in ``southern Eritrea
area.''

Just Fontaine's record 13 goals looks daunting 40 years later 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A lot will happen at the biggest ever World Cup,
but Just Fontaine need not worry, just yet. Despite Ronaldo,
Batistuta, Shearer and a slew of other prolific strikers, it is
unlikely his record of 13 goals in one World Cup tournament will
fall.
	   Forty years after setting the record at the 1958 World Cup in
Sweden, Fontaine is a star all over again.
	   ``I'd better enjoy it, because the next time it's in France,
I'll be in my coffin,'' the 64-year-old Frenchman said.
	   It is also increasingly likely his record like that will survive
him.
	   No one has come close since and the top-scoring title is now
regularly going to a striker who gets a half dozen goals.
	   And to think he wasn't even considered the best French forward
going into the 1958 tournament, where France lost to eventual
champion Brazil in the semifinals. He even scored them all with a
pair of soccer boots on loan because his shoes fell apart days
ahead of the finals.
	   And even with million-dollar apparel endorsement deals and
custom-made shoes, Fontaine knows no one will get close to him
because of three reasons.
	   First of all, ``in my days the record didn't mean a thing. No
reward, no golden boot, nothing whatsoever. Up to the point that
during the last game I didn't even shoot the penalty. Just didn't
think of it.''
	   ``So there was no pressure,'' he said. Now, being top scorer has
become one of the most prestigious titles at the World Cup.
	   Secondly, it means scoring almost two goals a game, with the
final four teams playing seven matches over the 32 days of
competition. ``In days like these you cannot be optimistic. How
could you be optimistic?''
	   Third, and perhaps the most convincing argument, is a defender's
knowledge of the striker.
	   Six months ahead of the World Cup, Fontaine needed surgery and,
for his comeback, he was a mere substitute. ``So, no one knew me,''
he said. ``And by the time they knew me, it was all over.''
	   Now, there is not a defender at the World Cup who doesn't know
every move of Ronaldo. There is not a single coach who doesn't have
a strategy to contain him. They might not stop him totally, but
allowing him to score 13 goals in seven games?
	   ``In my time, teams didn't even have spies to check out
opponents,'' said Fontaine. Now, every match is scouted and some
coaches spend weekend sitting video sessions of all potential
opponents.
	   So, what was his secret? ``You had to smell where the ball would
end up and allow you to score.''

Sudanese rebels capture strategic garrison town 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels captured the garrison town
of Ulu, on the road to a dam that provides most of Khartoum's
electricity, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The rebels defeated two government brigades in a daylong battle
Tuesday for Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of the
capital, said George Garang, spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   At least 72 government troops were killed, he said. No figures
on rebel casualties were provided.
	   Ulu is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of Damazin
and the Roseires dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's
electricity. The dam is about 500 kilometers (315 miles) southeast
of Khartoum.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

Russia's top judge urges death penalty repeal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top judge urged his nation Wednesday to
abolish the death penalty in accordance with its international
obligations.
	   ``We have signed the European convention, ratified it and must
fulfill the obligations taken,'' Russian Supreme Court's chairman
Vyacheslav Lebedev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov backed Lebedev, saying that
Russia should keep its pledge to abolish capital punishment.
	   However, newly-appointed Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov
said last week he considers it premature for Russia to ban the
death penalty taking into account ``both the criminal situation and
moral aspects of the problem.''
	   Russia promised to halt the death penalty in January 1996 when
it joined the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human
rights organization. Nonetheless, 92 people were executed before
President Boris Yeltsin imposed a moratorium later that year.
	   The government says there have been no executions since August
1996, but Yeltsin's efforts to outlaw executions have been blocked
by hard-liners in the Russian parliament who argue that the death
penalty is needed to keep soaring crime under control.
	   Polls show a majority of Russians support capital punishment.
	   Earlier this year, parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
ratified the European human rights convention with exception of a
death penalty ban.
	   With no ban in place, Russian courts have continued handing down
death sentences and about 1,000 people are now on death row,
according to the Amnesty International human rights group.

its Mediterranean partners Wednesday, trying to get the economic
cooperation process back on track after last year's derailment by
Mideast issues.
	   A year ago in Malta, the EU's 15 foreign ministers gathered with
their 12 Mediterranean colleagues to talk trade and investment,
only to see their meeting blown away on the turbulent winds of the
Mideast peace process.
	   Even at the inaugural meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean
conference in Barcelona in 1995, heady ideas also fell victim to
disputes, that time over human rights.
	   The Palermo meeting is an informal session with no set agenda.
Organizers hope it will bring the conference back to its original
idea of creating a European-Mediterranean free trade and security
zone by 2010.
	   Last year, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and then-Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy were the stars of the show, agreeing to
resuscitate the moribund Middle East peace talks. Today, those
talks are still stuck, and neither Arafat nor Israel's foreign
minister plans to turn up here.
	   ``This meeting is aimed at providing a new momentum to the
Barcelona process,'' EU foreign ministers said in a statement.
	   Mediterranean nations sell half their exports to EU countries
and provide the EU with 20 percent of its energy supplies. At the
same time, half of the Mediterranean nations' imports come from
Western Europe. The EU's per capita income is a dozen times higher
than most of the North African and Mideast nations.
	   Ministers here are continuing efforts to come up with a
Euro-Mediterranean Stability Charter and to establish
confidence-building measures for the region. Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said the EU wants to have this completed by
the Euro-Mediterranean meeting in Stuttgart, Germany, next year.
	   On the economic side, the 27 were to discuss support for
economies in transition, private investment in the non-European
Mediterranean countries and eventual realization of the free-trade
zone.
	   Depite the wish to move on, however, it's not possible to
contemplate security and stability in the Mediterranean without
peace between Israel and the Palestinians; Israel continues to
occupy a piece of neighboring Lebanon; stability is impossible
without a stop to the ceaseless killing in Algeria; no
Mediterranean security plan can be complete without Libya, absent
here; and Turkey's long battle with the Kurds shows no sign of
resolution.
	   Joining ministers from the European Union are officials from
Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority.

Deposed Afghan president says aid too slow to quake victims

	   SHARI BASURKH, Afghanistan (AP) _ With earthquake survivors in
remote regions still waiting Wednesday for food to arrive,
Afghanistan's deposed president criticized the international
response as too slow.
	   Burhanuddin Rabbani went by helicopter to Shari-Basurkh _ one of
the hardest hit areas _ on Tuesday to see the devastation caused by
Saturday's magnitude-6.9 quake and to settle a dispute among rebel
commanders who control the region.
	   The northern-based alliance established to stop the Taliban
religious army from consolidating its hold on Afghanistan has been
fraught with internal disputes. Several of them have turned
violent.
	   The feuding comes as residents of the area were trying to dig
themselves from the rubble caused by the deadly quake that killed
as many as 5,000 people, wiped out entire villages and left as many
as 60,000 people homeless.
	   The United Nations and the Red Cross have been coordinating
relief efforts, attempting to make several many helicopter runs a
day from the provincial capital, Faisabad, to remote villages to
pick up the wounded, and to drop off blankets, plastic sheeting and
tents.
	   ``We are trying to get in more helicopters ... this is where the
bottleneck has been,'' said Philip Spoerri, a Red Cross spokesman
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   The priority has been to get the wounded out and medical
supplies to the hardest hit areas and it hasn't been easy. On
Wednesday, he said 3 1/2 tons of medical supplies were to be sent
to Faisabad from Pakistan.
	   Much of the area is inaccessible by road.
	   In Shari Basurkh, near the epicenter, half the village was
flattened by the violent shaking that residents said lasted four
minutes. The quake struck during the late morning when most of the
men were in the fields, which is why the bulk of the wounded are
women, old men and children who had been at home at the time of the
quake, aid workers say.
	   In a makeshift clinic set up in an elementary school, 60 of the
injured lie side by side. A baby on an intravenous drip screams
next to a woman whose face is covered in yellow bruises.
	   Most people here haven't eaten since the earthquake hit. They
are afraid to stay inside, fearing aftershocks that have rattled
the region almost daily since the quake struck.
	   The United Nations has put out an appeal for helicopters
worldwide saying it has the aid ready to distribute to the victims
of the earthquake but limited means to get it to them.
	   The rugged mountain region has no roads leading from the
Badakshan capital of Faisabad to Shari Basurkh or scores of other
villages that lay in the quake's path.
	   ``Shari Basurkh is one of the hardest areas to reach,'' said
Spoerri.
	   Saturday's quake follows another deadly earthquake that struck
last February killing as many as 2,300 people and leaving thousands
more homeless.

Mir flying without a hitch on eve of docking with U.S. shuttle 
</HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Mir was ``flying without a hitch'' Wednesday on
the eve of a docking with U.S. space shuttle Discovery _ the ninth
and final American hookup with the Russian space station, an
official said.
	   Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir at around 9 p.m. Moscow
time (1700 GMT) Thursday and remain linked to the station for four
days. It will bring home astronaut Andrew Thomas, the seventh and
last American to live on Mir.
	   The shuttle flight faced a possible delay because of a three-day
failure of Mir's central computer that paralyzed its automatic
steering system and made the station too unstable for the docking.
	   Cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin finally fixed
the skittish computer on Monday and quickly reactivated the
steering system which has held Mir steady since then. On Tuesday,
they switched on Mir's 11 gyroscopes, the station's preferred,
fuel-free orientation system.
	   ``All Mir's equipment is now running without a hitch and the
station is fully ready for the docking,'' Mission Control spokesman
Valery Lyndin said Wednesday.
	   Mir's main computer operates the station's motion control
system, and when it fails, the station's energy supply dwindles
since it can't rotate to keep its solar panels in full alignment
with the sun.
	   Mir's computer repeatedly failed last year, prompting Russian
space officials to send up a replacement on a previous shuttle
flight in January. The new computer worked well until it broke down
Saturday, and cosmonauts replaced it from the station's supply of
spares.
	   The crew was busy Wednesday packing up U.S. scientific equipment
for return aboard Discovery. Officials said there was no room to
bring home personal belongings left behind by Thomas' six NASA
predecessors.
	   All the same, Musabayev is hoping there will room for his
guitar, which arrived on a Russian space ferry earlier this year,
Lyndin said.
	   The Russian crew returns to Earth in a tiny Soyuz landing
capsule which is barely large enough for the cosmonauts, let alone
any cargo.

Federico Garcia Lorca in New York _ `a feast of pneumatic drills' 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New York City's tough skin masked ``a river of
tender blood,'' Federico Garcia Lorca once wrote. It was a city
that both shocked and seduced him.
	   Spain's greatest modern poet aimed his verbal lens at the
metropolis where he fled in 1929 to escape deep depression. ``New
York, slime. New York, wire and death,'' he wrote. ``What angel is
hidden in your cheek?''
	   June 5 marks the centennial of Garcia Lorca's birth, and he's
being remembered in the city where he wrote ``Poet in New York,''
one of the most influential and disturbing books of 20th-century
verse. Farrar, Straus and Giroux is printing a new edition based on
the original manuscript, which was rediscovered last year in
Mexico.
	   Already famous at 31 for his poetry, art and music, Garcia Lorca
became a Columbia University student who lived in a dormitory and
tried _ without much success _ to learn English. What he wrote in
his native language later made him the most translated Spanish poet
ever, and a thorn in the side of the Fascists, who executed him
during the Spanish Civil War.
	   ``Like Walt Whitman, he created the figure of a poet in New
York. He created this Prometheus, this prophet who wrote the New
York poems,'' says Garcia Lorca scholar Christopher Maurer. ``He
let his hair down as a poet here, in a howl of metaphysical
loneliness.
	   ``The actual, flesh-and-blood Garcia Lorca who wandered around
the city was having a great time. He was fascinated by the place.''
	   Maurer recently introduced a reading of Garcia Lorca's work at
the 92nd Street Y by American poets Robert Bly, Philip Levine and
Galway Kinnell, and Spanish poet Angel Gonzalez.
	   At home in Spain, Garcia Lorca, son of a prosperous farmer from
Andalucia, had focused his artistic microscope on himself and a
rural Roman Catholic society. New York shook him up. Cut off by the
language barrier and often writing home for more money, he roamed
the big city seeking ``the earthworm in the landscape of fire
escapes.''
	   The iron stairs hanging from buildings became his metaphor for
the city.
	   ___  
	   ``Dawn in New York groans
	   on enormous fire escapes
	   searching between the angles
	   for spikenards of drafted anguish.''
	   ___  
	   Walking streets that were a ``feast of pneumatic drills,'' he
watched people working, a mass of toiling automatons that ``drowns
itself in machinery and lament.''
	   He humanized them: ``I denounce everyone who ignores the other
half, the half that can't be redeemed, who lift their mountains of
cement where the heart beats. ... The other half hears me,
devouring ... flying in their purity.''
	   The poet witnessed the merciless power of the new industrial
society during the stock market crash of 1929, rushing to Wall
Street to watch the trading.
	   He decried ``the cruel silence of money,'' reflected at night in
``the conspiracy of these deserted offices that radiate no agony.''
	   ``New York awoke his social consciousness,'' says Charles
Saliba, a Columbia student who grew up in Garcia Lorca's region of
Spain and who lived in the poet's old dorm room last year.
	   On a recent Sunday morning, Saliba led a walking tour of the
neighborhoods and buildings that were home to Garcia Lorca during
the academic year 1929-30, when he helped teach Spanish literature
while taking courses.
	   Stopping in front of a Harlem project a few blocks north of the
university, Saliba read ``King of Harlem,'' a poem about a popular,
strong-willed man stuck in a menial job:
	   ``Ay, Harlem,'' Garcia Lorca called out in Spanish to the
primarily black neighborhood. ``There is no anguish like that of
... your grand king, a prisoner in the uniform of a doorman. ...
Cooks, waiters, and those whose tongues lick clean the wounds of
millionaires seek the king in the streets. ... Ay, Harlem,
threatened by a mob of headless suits! I hear your murmur.''
	   Garcia Lorca was incensed by injustices like the ``whites only''
rule that excluded black guests from big-time clubs where they were
often the star performers.
	   He spent many nights partying in Harlem, discovering jazz and
the blues, and making friends using his charm and lively piano
playing. He shared with them his love of flamenco, the music of
Spain's persecuted Gypsies whose songs about death, lost love and
betrayal are echoed in the furious rhythms of Garcia Lorca's New
York verse.
	   On another day at the 92nd Street Y, Spanish music by composers
Garcia Lorca knew and admired, including Manuel de Falla, was
performed by guitarist Sharon Isbin and mezzo-soprano Denyce
Graves. Soprano Ana Maria Martinez sang Garcia Lorca's arrangements
of five Spanish songs. It was the type of folk music that had
inspired his earlier poetry.
	   In New York, Garcia Lorca dipped his poetry into new ethnic
groups and cutting-edge lifestyles, carousing with friends like
poet Hart Crane. He saw his own troubled homosexuality reflected in
``the men with that green look in their eyes who love other men and
burn their lips in silence.''
	   But he abhorred their decadent prostitution, their ``tumescent
flesh,'' and instead embraced his own torn, private soul.

	   He was discovering himself, a changing man ``bumping into my own
face, different each day,'' as he wrote after an afternoon stroll
in Riverside Park near Columbia. At times, he was ``not a man, not
a poet, not a leaf, only a wounded pulse.''
	   Still, in the harsh city, he found bits of beauty.
	   ___  
	   ``I was on the terrace, wrestling with the moon.
	   Swarms of windows riddled one of the night's thighs.''
	   And he came alive:

	   The mask will dance among columns of blood and numbers,
	   among hurricanes of gold and groans of the unemployed.''
	   ___  
	   At the end of the academic year, Garcia Lorca took his social
rage home to Europe, speaking out against fascism and class
differences. His vociferous protests drew charges that he was a
Soviet spy, leading to his execution in 1936 in his beloved Spanish
countryside.
	   The New York experience had pushed Garcia Lorca to voice
stinging words that swept his soul ``toward the cobra's tongue,''
as he said in one poem.
	   His words eventually cost him his life.

Emirates flies 40 tons of aid to Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A plane carrying 40 tons
of medicine and medical equipment left Wednesday for Iraq, a
spokesman for the Red Crescent society said.
	   Another plane carrying an additional 40 tons of aid will leave
Friday, said a spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The goods were collected by the Red Crescent Society, the
Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, which has sent more than 22
million dirhams (dlrs 6 million) worth of aid to Iraq since 1996,
the group said.
	   A number of Red Crescent officials will fly Wednesday to the
Iraqi capital Baghdad to help distribute the aid.
	   The charity organization has said it plans to open an office in
Baghdad by the end of the year to coordinate the distribution of
humanitarian aid.
	   The Emirates has sent six planes to Iraq in the past six months
carrying food, medicine and clothing, the official Emirates News
Agency said.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions bar it from exporting oil, except for a
limited quantity under U.N. supervision, and also prohibit direct
flights to the country. The United Nations has to approve
humanitarian flights.
	   Arab states have recently increased their shipments of aid to
Iraq, reflecting widespread opposition to the sanctions among their
populations.
	   The U.N. Security Council says the sanctions will not be lifted
until Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi government says at least 1.5 million deaths during the
past seven years have been caused by shortages brought about by the
sanctions. The U.N. Children's Fund says that 960,000 Iraqi
children are suffering from malnutrition.

Bureaucrats sent to India's Siberia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Three bureaucrats who have displeased
India's defense minister are being sent to this country's
equivalent of Siberia _ an icy border wasteland over which India
and Pakistan regularly battle, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The Pioneer newspaper, quoting anonymous defense sources, said
Defense Minister George Fernandes, returning from an April visit to
the Siachen glacier, was angered to find the bureaucrats had been
sitting for more than a year on a request from soldiers on the
glacier for 10 snowmobiles.
	   Fernandes ordered that at least 10 snowmobiles be sent to
Siachen every year, and directed the unnamed Defense Ministry
bureaucrats to spend at least a week on the glacier to familiarize
themselves with the needs of troops posted there.
	   The Times of India added that such familiarization postings
could become standard under the energetic Fernandes, named defense
minister when a new government took over two months ago.
	   The glacier, some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of New
Delhi, is more than 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level.
Both India and Pakistan claim Siachen, and skirmishes are common
across the frontier despite the area being frozen all the time.
	   Temperatures on Siachen usually hover around minus 55 Celsius
(minus 67 Fahrenheit), with wind speeds of up to 100 kilometers (66
miles) per hour.

Tamil rebels attack in wildlife park, killing one soldier 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger guerrillas attacked
civilian and military vehicles inside Sri Lanka's most popular
wildlife park, killing one soldier, wounding two and burning seven
vehicles, the military said Wednesday.
	   News of Monday's attack in a remote area of the Yala National
Park in southeastern Sri Lanka did not reach the capital, 170
kilometers (105 miles) away, until Wednesday.
	   More than a dozen civilians caught in the attack were released
unharmed by the rebels, said Major Kumara Dewage, a military
spokesman.
	   The park has been kept open despite sporadic hit and run attacks
by rebels over the past two years which have destroyed most of its
tourist bungalows. The military has set up several bases inside the
park.
	   Most of the fighting is in the north where government troops are
trying to capture a key highway. Most of the east is controlled by
government troops, but rebels occupy jungle areas and a few towns.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland for the
nation's minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18
million people. The militants say they are oppressed by the
majority Sinhalese, who dominate the government and military. More
than 52,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in
1983.

Giant Russian cargo plane lands safely after engine failure 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A heavyweight Russian cargo plane made an
emergency landing in the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok on
Wednesday after one of its four engines shut down during flight. No
one was hurt, officials said.
	   The An-124 Ruslan cargo plane with a crew of eight belonging to
the private Volga-Dnepr air carrier was flying from Osaka, Japan to
Anchorage, Alaska when it suffered an engine failure.
	   The crew spent the remaining fuel and successfully landed at the
Vladivostok airport as several ambulance crews and fire engines
waited on the tarmac, Russian news agencies reported.
	   A plane of the same type belonging to the Russian Air Force
crashed into a residential area in the Siberian city of Irkutsk
last December, killing at least 69 people in Russia's worst air
disaster last year. The crash occurred when three of the plane's
four engines shut down seconds after take-off.
	   The Russian government initially blamed the crash on design
flaws in the plane's Ukrainian-manufactured engines, but reopened
the inquiry after protests from Ukraine.

Spice drag act grabs spotlight as real Girls face troubles

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The real Spice Girls may be down to
four now that Ginger Spice has quit, but a full five-man _ yes, man
_ Spice act is getting increased attention in Thailand thanks to
the group's troubles.
	   Five Thai transvestites are performing Spice Girl routines to
suddenly packed houses this week thanks to front-page publicity the
real group has received from the departure of Geri Halliwell.
	   The Spice Girls have inspired lookalike bands worldwide, but few
more exotic than Bangkok's ``Ersatz Spice'' whose members don
leather and tiger-print outfits and lipsync such hits as
``Wannabe'' and ``Spice Up Your Life.''
	   Transvestite cabaret is a popular tourist attraction in
Thailand, and the Spice Girls are just one of 12 such acts
performed twice nightly by a troupe of 40 transvestites at the Asia
Hotel.
	   Ersatz Spice is the crowd favorite, though, and business has
been up this past week amid reports of the real group's problems,
says Krisana Usanachitt, the marketing manager.
	   ``Tour agents say tickets are easy to sell to foreign tourists
by mentioning the Spice Girls' performance,'' Krisana said.
	   Two sold-out shows _ price per ticket 600 baht (dlrs 14) for
foreigners, 350 baht (dlrs 8.50) for Thais _ Tuesday bore him out.
	   The Thai press has meanwhile run front-page stories on the
transvestite group since the departure of Halliwell threatened to
split up the British pop group.
	   ``No matter when they separate, they've already become a
legend,'' Krisana said. ``People will remember them.''
	   Twenty-four-year-old Akanit Rattanavichit, the Ginger Spice
lookalike, said the Spice Girls had already scored many hits, so
maybe it was time for them to move on.
	   He admitted that he prefers alternative music to Spice Girl pop
and was picked to play Ginger only because he was the most buxom
member of the troupe.
	   But Metha Panthana, 23, who plays Scary Spice (Melanie Brown),
is a real fan.
	   ``It was quite a surprise for me to learn that Geri is leaving
the group,'' Metha said. ``I think they are in the limelight and
should not separate this quickly.''
	   They are unsure how the fate of the real Spice Girls will affect
their act, which they say was a challenge to learn.
	   Tosapol Sornpathawong, 22, who play Sporty Spice (Melanie
Chisholm), said he had to watch the group's videos many times to
catch her character. He then trained hard to build up the same
performance stamina.
	   The audience seems to appreciate the effort.
	   ``It's fantastic how they copy the Spice Girls,'' said Maria
Wimplinger, 29, an Austrian tourist. ``If I didn't look at their
faces, I'd say, Yes! _ they're the Spice Girls.''

Moderate quake rattles central Greece 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Four strong earthquakes shook central
Greece on Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports of
injuries or serious damage.
	   The temblors, with preliminary magnitudes between 4.5 and 5.2,
occurred between 11:36 and 11:49 a.m. (0836 and 0849 GMT) with an
epicenter under the sea bed 210 kilometers north of Athens, the
Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   The quakes were strongly felt in parts of central Greece and the
northern province of Halkidiki, as well as on the Aegean island of
Limnos, the institute said.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

World meteorologists say El Nino disruptions coming to an end 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ There was good news Wednesday from the world's
weather forecasters: the massive disruptions caused by El Nino are
coming to an end.
	   The World Meteorological Organization said the current round of
El Nino ``is in its dying stages,'' but conceded there was
considerable uncertainty ``about the rate of weakening.''
	   El Nino, a disruptive weather phenomenon that returned in 1997,
has been blamed for flooding in Kenya, drought in Indonesia and
heavy snow in the southwestern United States. It has even been
credited with lengthening the days on Earth by slowing its
rotation.
	   Unlike previous episodes which lingered for years, the current
El Nino ``is showing clear signs of weakening,'' said the World
Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency.
	   The organization's update said the four conditions typical of
the weather phenomenon are becoming less pronounced. Those
conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of
precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of
trade winds; and changes in sea level.
	   El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting
in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
	   It also helps trigger some man-made disasters. For example,
fires set by farmers and plantation owners in Indonesia in 1997 and
1998 swept through unusually dry forests, shrouding much of
Southeast Asia in thick haze.
	   The World Meteorological Association (WMO) said it is difficult
to predict just when this round of El Nino will come to an end.
	   ``One model has conditions moving rapidly towards normal by
mid-1998, and another has El Nino lingering on towards the end of
the year,'' the report stated.
	   During a press conference Tuesday, the organization's
secretary-general Godwin Obasi, of Nigeria, said he expected the
former scenario, with El Nino tapering off by the end of this
month.
	   Such a development could be followed by the so-called La Nina
effect, which could reverse some of the effects of the current
disturbances and, in Southeast Asia, help curb some of the forest
fires.
	   However, the international weathermen said it's far from certain
whether La Nina will occur.
	   The U.N. weather agency predicts drier-than-normal conditions
over Indonesia, Micronesia and southern South America during the
next two months. Wetter conditions than usual will continue over
the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern
South America.
	   John Miller, chief of the environment division at WMO, told The
Associated Press that the forecast was a conservative prediction
that discounted the possibility of an immediate end to El Nino or a
La Nina episode.
	   This was despite growing evidence to suggest such an occurrence,
because forecasts rely on a consensus of results in the computer
predictions.

U.S. howitzers unsuitable for Kuwaiti army, legislators says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Legislators have criticized the government for
wanting to buy U.S. made howitzers despite expert opinion they were
unsuitable for Kuwait's army, Al-Rai Al-Amm daily reported
Wednesday.
	   The 50-seat house referred the matter to one of its panels for
investigation after listening to ``serious information'' presented
at its weekly session Tuesday by legislator Mubarak al-Duwailah,
the daily said.
	   Al-Duwailah told deputies he had three reports by different
Kuwaiti military committees saying the Paladin howitzers were
inappropriate for their requirements.
	   ``All this information says (the howitzer) is as good as scrap,
but there is a political decision,'' to buy it, the Muslim
fundamentalist legislator said.
	   He claimed the deal was worth dlrs 620 million and accused the
government of wasting public money to please the United States, its
main Gulf War ally.
	   The deal has not been officially announced here, but the
Pentagon said in March it intends to sell Kuwait 48 of the
self-propelled armored howitzers with support equipment, all worth
dlrs 496 million.
	   Other legislators joined al-Duwailah in attacking the
government, according to the paper. They called on it not to go
through with the deal before the panel for protection of public
money comes back with a report about its investigation.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah asked the
angry legislators to wait until they get a reaction from the
defense minister to their allegations.
	   About eight years after Iraqi troops invaded this oil-rich
state, Kuwait is still rebuilding its military.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Threatening a long and devastating strike, Air
France's leading pilots' union was talking tough after the first
round of negotiations in a three-day-old walkout already disrupting
some World Cup preparations.
	   The strike at state-owned Air France _ the World Cup's official
carrier _ was a serious embarrassment to the French government,
which also faced walkouts among Paris transit workers Thursday and
national railworkers strike Friday.
	   Talks were resume at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday, seven days
before the championship begins. No progress was reported after the
first round Tuesday.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   After 5 1-2 hours of negotiations Tuesday inside Air France
headquarters at Charles de Gaulle Airport, union leader
Jean-Charles Corbet said the dispute ``will probably be long, it
will probably be tough. ... and devastating for the balance
sheet.''
	   Corbet, head of the SNPL union that represents most of the
airline's 3,200 pilots, accused the airline's president, Jean-Cyril
Spinetta, of ``contenting himself with renewing his demands''
during the talks.
	   While faced with a slated two-week walkout, Spinetta on
Wednesday morning said he remained ``firm on my objectives'' but
that ``on the means to reach them, we can and must discuss them.''
	   For the pilots, among the highest paid in the world, the company
wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs (dlrs
83 million) in pay cuts. But it's offered to eventually do away
with a two-tier salary schedule that pays less to new pilots.
	   Spinetta told Europe 1 radio he was ready to spend ``the
afternoon, the night and beyond'' to reach an agreement.
	   ``I can't imagine that the pilots, at the moment where the
world's eyes are turned to France for this great celebration that
is the World Cup, will paralyze the country,'' Spinetta said.
	   The carrier, which managed to report a profit in the last two
years, was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per
day during the strike that was forcing tens of thousands of people
worldwide to look for other ways to travel.
	   France's interior minister criticized the ``lack of
civic-mindedness'' of the pilots, saying he felt ``sadness, almost
shame.''
	   Because of the strike, Jean-Pierre Chevenement told Radio Monte
Carlo, France could show itself as a nation that can't organize a
world event anymore.''
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national team,
said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a three-day
weekend to visit their families and were supposed to resume
training Tuesday.
	   ``Yes, indeed a lot of players will arrive late because of the
strike. It risks turning our whole day upside down,'' Jacquet said.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and would probably use outside
carriers to meet its obligations if necessary.
	   But the U.S. Soccer Federation, heading to France on Thursday,
said it is flying its team to Paris on American Airlines,
connecting to an Air France flight to Lyon. As a backup, the
Americans have rented buses in France.
	   Paris subway drivers with the Communist-led CGT union were to
walk off the job Thursday, but the Paris transit authority RATP
said it expected no effect on service since the union represented
only a minority of the employees.
	   At the national railway SNCF, conductors with three unions were
to strike beginning Friday night though Sunday evening. The
railroad said it was assessing what effect the walkout may have.

Ruling Bosnian Croat party splits in two 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A prominent Bosnian Croat
politician who is forming a new party suggested, in comments cited
Wednesday, that his move was prompted by disgust over corruption
among the leadership of the leading Bosnian Croat party.
	   Dealing a blow to hard-liners, Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member
of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, announced the creation of a new
party Tuesday, three months before general elections in Bosnia and
after months of power struggle in the Bosnian Croat leadership.
	   The move effectively splits the ruling Croat Democratic Union,
ending its years-long monopoly on votes of most Bosnian Croats.
	   In comments published Wednesday by the daily Vjesnik in
neighboring Croatia, Zubak said he decided to form a new party
after realizing that the leadership positions of the Croat
Democratic Union were being stacked by people ``who amassed huge
wealth during the last few years.''
	   ``These people want to divide Bosnia,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   There were no details about the future program and orientation
of the new party. But sources said most of its members _ among them
several prominent Bosnian Croats, including Zubak and a few federal
ministers _ are considered moderates, supporting the Dayton peace
accord and a unified Bosnia.
	   The move was expected to please outside powers involved in
Bosnia because it weakened the Croat Democratic Union, a
traditionally hard-line party that has turned even more rigid in
the past few months. Nationalists leading the party oppose returns
of Serb or Muslim refugees and other aspects of the Dayton accord.
	   A similar split in the Bosnian Serb leadership last year marked
one of the biggest breakthroughs in Bosnia since the 1995 end of
the war. Western powers used that chance to support Serb moderates
and sideline the old hard-line leadership.
	   The dominant Muslim SDA party also has had to deal with much
stronger opposition from two Social Democrat parties in the
Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Bosnian Croat sources said the new party will try to run in the
September elections despite the fact that the registration period
for the parties has ended.

Sodium cyanide spill in Kyrgyzstan claims first victim company which operates the gold mine. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Kyrgyz president meeting chief of Canadian
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A sodium cyanide spill which sickened 600 people
and polluted an ecologically important lake in the former Soviet
republic of Kyrgyzstan claimed its first fatality on Wednesday,
officials said.
	   The woman, whose identity wasn't given, died in a hospital in
the town of Karakol near Lake Issyk Kul, one of the largest bodies
of water in Central Asia, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Interfax quoted doctors saying that the patient had died of
sodium cyanide poisoning that exacerbated her previous illness.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev discussed the incident on
Wednesday with Michel Bernard, the visiting chief of Canada's
Cameco company, which operates the gold mine for which the cyanide
was headed.
	   Cameco, the world's largest publicly traded uranium company,
operates the Kumtor gold mine through its subsidiary, Kumtor
Operating Co. With dlrs 500 million in the project, Cameco is a
major foreign investor in the impoverished Central Asian country.
	   On May 20, a truck carrying 20 tons of highly toxic sodium
cyanide powder to the mine veered off a mountain road and crashed
into the Barskaan river, which feeds into Lake Issyk Kul. The huge
lake is the center of a valuable nature preserve and home to
several rare species.
	   The damaged containers leaked 1,700 kilograms (3,400 pounds) of
sodium cyanide into the river and some of it reached the lake.
	   Kyrgyz officials have said the river and the lake were not
expected to suffer any long-term damage.
	   Cameco's Bernard, speaking to reporters in Kyrgyzstan's capital
Bishkek on Wednesday, insisted the spill was minor and posed no
serious threat to people or the environment, Interfax reported.
	   He said the chemical fell into a small bay in the lake for
little more than one day, which couldn't seriously affect such a
large body of water. Lake Issyk Kul covers 6,200 sq. kilometers
(2,400 sq. miles) and is 670 meters (2,210 feet) deep.
	   However, local officials have said fish and cattle were killed
near the site of the spill and some 600 people have sought medical
treatment for poisoning, of whom about 100 have been hospitalized.
	   Farmland has also been contaminated by villagers who used water
from the river on their crops, officials said. World Health
Organization experts have recommended that local residents avoid
produce grown in the area, Interfax said.

Estrada to pursue diplomatic solution to Spratlys dispute 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada will
pursue a diplomatic solution to the territorial dispute in the
South China Sea's Spratly Islands, but will reinforce the country's
military to back up its claims, an official said Wednesday.
	   Orlando Mercado, the defense department's secretary-designate,
said there was no indication violence would erupt in the contested
areas in the near future but added that they remained a source of
regional tension.
	   Estrada was proclaimed winner of the May 11 presidential
elections by Congress last Friday and will be inaugurated on June
30.
	   The disputes have often strained ties between countries that lay
claim to the islands, although all have vowed to resolve the issue
peacefully.
	   China has claimed the whole of the Spratlys, which it calls the
Nansha Islands. Vietnam and Taiwan also claim all of the Spratlys,
while Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines claim some of the
islands, which are believed to be rich in oil and natural gas.
	   The Philippines occupies eight of the islands, which it
collectively calls the Kalayaan Island Group. It has been holding
elections in the biggest island, called Pag-asa, to reinforce its
claim.
	   The Philippines has one of the weakest armed forces among the
claimants but has started to modernize its military.

Stocks rebound on technical buying 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Stocks rebounded in Hong Kong on Wednesday
after the key index shed 900 points, or about 10 percent, in the
previous seven sessions. But traders were skeptical about the
rally's staying power.
	   The main Hang Seng Index was boosted by a stronger yen, a fall
in local interest rates and short-covering in the futures market,
traders said. It rose 221.05 points, or 2.6 percent, to finish at
8,819.22.
	   Volume was 5.72 billion Hong Kong dollars, up from 5.53 billion
Hong Kong dollars in the previous session.
	   The index edged up in the morning, and then began a steady rise
through the afternoon, when it caught up with the futures market.
	   ``The strengthening of yen has triggered some short-covering and
bargain hunting,'' said Percy Au-Young, sales director at DBS
Securities.
	   Other traders were quick to call Wednesday's rise a purely
technical rebound, with big investment houses covering their
positions after pocketing a profit from the recent market downturn.
	   Leading the advance Wednesday were property shares, which have
taken a beating on the market in recent weeks. The property
subindex rose 336.51 points, or 3.3 percent, to end at 10,449.55.
	   Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. rose 1.00 to 40.70; Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd., another giant developer, gained 1.40 to 36.80;
Henderson Land Development Co. ended up 1.15 at 27.95.
	   British bank HSBC Holding gained 5.50 to 190.00; its affiliate
Hang Seng Bank shed 75 cents to 52.00.

U.S. asks Arabs to delay summit by one week 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United States has asked Jordan and
Saudi Arabia to postpone by one week a proposed Arab summit on the
faltering Middle East peace process, a government official said
Wednesday.
	   The official, who requested anonymity, said the request was made
Tuesday by Thomas Pickering, an undersecretary of state for
political affairs.
	   Pickering met with King Hussein and other government officials.
He also met with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, who was visiting
Jordan in preparation for the summit.
	   ``The U.S. requested that the summit be postponed by one week to
give the United States enough time to declare the success or the
failure of its efforts to revive the peace process,'' the official
said.
	   He declined to say what the Arab response was.
	   But another official, also insisting on anonymity, said he
expected the U.S. request to be heeded to ``since more preparations
are needed for the summit.''
	   The Clinton administration has proposed that Israel make a
further 13.1 troop withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel rejected,
saying it can only pull out from 9 percent of the land. The United
States has reportedly given time to Israel to reconsider its
position.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who accepted the U.S.
proposal, has called for the summit to map out a unified Arab
strategy on the stalled peace process.
	   But the Arabs appear to be divided over the agenda of the
summit, which Syria insists it should put an end to Arab
normalization of ties with Israel in order to punish it for its
hard-line peace policy.
	   Arab diplomats say Syria also wants to host the summit and
exclude Jordan and the Palestinians in retaliation for their peace
treaties with Israel _ which left Damascus and Lebanon out in the
cold.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have warned a key dissident to keep a low
profile as China neared Thursday's ninth anniversary of the armed
quelling of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, a rights group
reported.
	   Police surveillance and detentions of dissidents, stepped up
every year since the June 4, 1989, military assault, have gained
added urgency. Authorities don't want any trouble to mar a
China-U.S. summit late this month or spark unrest among millions of
workers laid off from decrepit state factories.
	   Their fears have come to the fore in Xi'an, a grimy industrial
center in central China where U.S. President Bill Clinton will
visit.
	   Police beat one of the thousands of onlookers watching a sit-in
on a busy road by 200 workers from the No. 1 Construction Co. to
protest layoffs on Tuesday, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported
Wednesday.
	   The onlooker incited the police by calling out to the
protesters, and the beating left him with injuries to many parts of
his body, the group said. A police spokesman in Xi'an denied that
the protest or the beating occurred.
	   On Monday, Xi'an police went to the home of influential
democracy campaigner Lin Mu, who led 11 others in sending a bold
open letter recently calling for democratic reforms and an inquiry
into the 1989 military assault and ensuing nationwide crackdown.
	   Police warned Lin not to do or say anything that might cause
chaos, the Information Center said.
	   Lin was the secretary to a leading reformer of the 1980s,
Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
	   Party elders ousted Hu in 1987 for having failed to stop an
earlier wave of student-led protests. His death in April 1989
sparked the demonstrations that eventually brought more than 1
million people to Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
	   Under orders from Chinese leaders, the military fought its way
into Beijing early on June 4, 1989 to end the six weeks of
demonstrations. Hundreds if not thousands of people were killed.
Thousands more were arrested in a nationwide crackdown.
	   Plainclothes police kept watch on Tiananmen, in central Beijing,
in greater than normal numbers Wednesday.
	   The Information Center reported at least two more dissidents are
believed to be in police custody, in addition to the 20 or so
detained in the past two weeks to prevent any commemorations of the
deaths in 1989.
	   Longtime democracy activist Xu Wenli has been missing since
Friday when he left Beijing to visit friends in the southern city
of Shenzhen. Liu Lianjun, an activist from eastern Shandong
province, was last seen in Beijing Friday.
	   Dissidents have repeatedly appealed for the government to
investigate and divulge the death toll. Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao ruled out Tuesday any inquiry saying that the party and
government had reached the correct conclusion.

Workers continue strike despite government concession 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Employees of Greece's fourth-largest bank
refused Wednesday to scale back a three-week strike despite the
government's concession to one of their main demands.
	   Ionian Bank workers walked off the job May 8 protesting
government plans to sell off the state-run bank, part of a broad
plan to streamline the economy in view of European monetary union.
	   Socialist Premier Costas Simitis initially insisted no
concessions could be made and that Ionian's privatization was an
essential part of plans to trim the inflated public sector.
	   But the government backed down to one of the unionists' main
demands Tuesday _ providing current Ionian employees with a
guaranteed job until the retirement age of 62.
	   National Economy Minister Yannos Papantoniou was quoted by Greek
media saying a clause will be included in the bank's sale contract
that forbids the new owner from firing Ionian workers.
	   Speaking after a meeting with unionists, Papantoniou said the
new proposal should not create any problems in the bank's
privatization prospects. He added that ``everything will be solved
when the bank begins operating normally,'' local media said.
	   But Ionian workers' union president Yiannis Markakis vowed the
strike would continue until the government revoked the sale plan
altogether.
	   Any further concessions in the sale plan could jeopardize the
government's efforts to join the EU's single currency club by 2001.
	   ``If there is not progress in these sectors, the markets will
grow concerned about the government's ability to implement its
reform program,'' said central bank governor Lukas Papademos in an
interview with the Sunday Eleftherotypia newspaper.
	   The sale of Ionian will ``accelerate the restructuring of the
banking sector and the creation of a competitive environment''
Papademos said. ``That is the reason why it's necessary to sell the
bank before the end of the year.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tensions mounted Wednesday, a day after bomb
attacks on government sites killed at least three people.
	   State-run radio reported a bomb explosion at a government
building in northern Tehran late Tuesday, but did not say if there
were any casualties or give the cause of the blast. It did not
identify the government building.
	   But the Iraq-based Iranian opposition, Mujahedeen Khalq, said in
a statement Wednesday that it carried out two mortar attacks late
Tuesday on military facilities in the capital.
	   Earlier Tuesday, a bomb exploded at the Revolutionary
Prosecutor's office in Tehran, in which official sources, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, said at least three people
were killed and two injured.
	   The Mujahedeen, the largest Iranian opposition group, also
claimed responsibility for that bombing, saying the attacks were in
retaliation for the killing of its members in recent months by the
Iranian government.
	   The group said it launched two mortar attacks late Tuesday on
the Central Command Headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps and an hour later on the Defense Industries
Organization.
	   ``In the surprise attack (on IRGC headquarters), several
Revolutionary Guards were killed or wounded and the headquarters'
buildings were damaged,'' the group said in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
	   It did not claim any casualties for the attack on the defense
industries building.
	   However, Iranian radio said that an attempted attack by
``saboteurs'' at the headquarters of the IRGC Tuesday was foiled by
security men, but gave no other details. It said the perpetrators
fled.
	   The three victims of Tuesday's explosion, including an Armenian
named Wilhelm Vigen who worked as a technician at the government
building, were buried Wednesday following funeral services in
Tehran.
	   Newspapers reported contradictory casualty figures, with one
paper saying that five people were killed in the mid-morning blast
and another reporting that nine people also were injured. The
Gozaresh'e Rooz daily said that two women and three men had been
killed.
	   Meanwhile, sources said that police evacuated guests and staff
at the Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran early Wednesday following a
bomb threat made by a caller. No bomb was found at the hotel, which
is close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   A police official at the scene said the explosion at the
Prosecutor's Office was caused by a bomb placed in a briefcase.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Tuesday's blast
was caused by explosives and indicated that the material was being
brought to the court as evidence in a case under investigation when
it went off accidentally.
	   But Tehran television and radio only reported an explosion,
without specifying if it was a bomb or saying whether there were
any casualties.
	   Bombings are rare in Tehran where security is tightly
controlled. The last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago
when two devices went off in a commercial district but caused no
fatalities. Those explosions remain a mystery.

Iran urges India and Pakistan to resume dialogue to ease tensions 
</HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Iran on Wednesday urged India and
Pakistan to talk to reduce tensions created by the nearly dozen
nuclear tests they have conducted, striking a conciliatory note
after earlier praising Pakistan's ``Islamic bomb.''
	   India has said its offer of talks with Pakistan has been on the
table for weeks, but neither country has made a serious effort
toward reopening peace negotiations begun under a previous Indian
government.
	   ``We believe in a nuclear weapons free zone in the region,''
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters after
meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the
Indian capital.
	   Kharrazi is the first foreign dignitary to visit the region
after India conducted five tests May 11-13 and Pakistan responded
two weeks later with what it said were six tests.
	   Predominately Hindu India and officially Islamic Pakistan have
fought three wars since they won independence from the British
rulers 50 years ago, and skirmishes still often breaks out across
their border. Two of the wars were over the control of the disputed
northern Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
	   A top Indian foreign ministry official said India was ready for
bilateral talks with Pakistan but found international concerns
about the situation in South Asia were exaggerated.
	   ``Life is normal. There is no ground for exaggeration and
dramatizing the situation,'' said Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath,
who attended Kharrazi's meeting with the Indian prime minister.
	   The Indian foreign secretary said New Delhi sees no need for
other countries to get involved in the Kashmiri dispute. Western
leaders meeting Thursday in Geneva to discuss how to defuse nuclear
tension between India and Pakistan may take up the question of
Kashmir.
	   Iran, Kharrazi said, has been very concerned about developments
in South Asia following nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. But he
welcomed the Pakistani tests.
	   ``The development of a nuclear bomb by a Muslim country can act
as a deterrent for Israel,'' he said. No Arab country is now
believed capable of making a nuclear weapon, while Israel is
considered an undeclared nuclear power.
	   Iran has repeatedly denied U.S. and Israeli allegations that it
is close to building a nuclear weapon. Kharrazi has said Iran's
nuclear facilities are open to international inspectors.
	   Kharrazi has said Iran was a signatory to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
supported global disarmament.
	   Kharrazi arrived in New Delhi on Tuesday after meeting with
Pakistani leaders in Islamabad.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ U.N. and Red Cross helicopters
carried plastic sheeting and emergency food supplies to
earthquake-shattered Afghan villages on Wednesday, in some cases to
feed people who had not eaten in nearly five days.
	   Piles of tent poles and tarpaulins, cakes of brown hand soap,
stacks of flour and stretchers lay across the airstrip at Faisabad
that has become the local headquarters for the rescue and relief
effort following Saturday's deadly 6.9 magnitude quake.
	   As many as 5,0000 people are believed to have died when the
violent tremor shook the earth triggering landslides and collapsing
entire villages.
	   The extent of damage was still being assessed using helicopters
to locate devastated villages that had not even been on the map.
	   The surveying and relief efforts have been hampered by a severe
lack of helicopters and fuel.
	   The aid agencies got 20 barrels of fuel for helicopters on
Wednesday, after putting out an emergency appeal for both fuel and
helicopters. However it was still in Duchambe in neighboring
Tajikistan.
	   The helicopters were pressing on Wednesday into northern areas
that had not yet been surveyed, said Juan Martinez, the Red Cross
spokesman said.
	   The helicopters dropped emergency supplies, aid workers quickly
assessed further need and loaded the most badly injured on to the
helicopters for delivery to the hospital in Faisalabad.
	   In the town of Shari Basurkh many of the injured had not eaten
since the quake hit on Saturday.
	   Medical volunteers, who have been traveling in to the mountains
each day, said there was a desperate need in many other places for
food and water.
	   As well there still were several villages accessible only by
horse or donkey that aid workers have not been able to see from the
ground.

Estrada to remove chairman of Subic freeport 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada plans
to replace the chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority,
one of the Philippines' most succesful economic ventures, when he
takes office June 30.
	   Estrada said Tuesday that Richard Gordon, a former mayor, will
be among the officials he will replace after his inauguration.
	   Gordon is credited with transforming the Subic freeport from a
volcano-ravaged former U.S. naval base into a bustling trade,
industry and tourism center.
	   ``He has no monopoly on leadership,'' said Estrada, reacting to
news reports that Gordon intended to resist the ouster. Gordon has
refused to comment on Estrada's plan.
	   Estrada said he will replace Gordon with former Congressman
Felicito Payumo, a known critic of Gordon.
	   Estrada was proclaimed winner of the May 11 presidential
elections by Congress last Friday.
	   Gordon, former mayor of Olongapo City, outside the Subic base,
had fought fiercely against Philippine senators, including Estrada,
who voted in 1991 not to extend the U.S. lease on the base. The
naval facility was closed the following year.
	   The base's closure caused more than 44,000 Filipinos to lose
their jobs and dealt a severe blow to the economy of surrounding
towns, including Olongapo, which provided services and served as
red-light districts for U.S. servicemen.
	   Subic had served as the largest U.S. naval base outside the
United States and was a major supply and training base for its
naval forces in the western Pacific.
	   The 1991 eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo hastened the
departure of the Americans.
	   After the Americans left, Gordon, backed by hundreds of
volunteers worked feverishly to transform the 62,000-acre base into
an industrial complex, free port and tourism center.
	   Gordon, 45, is the grandson of an American who came to the
Philippines when U.S. troops seized the islands in 1898.
	   Several major international firms, mostly Taiwanese and
Singaporean, have set up operations such as a container port,
textile and electronics manufacturing and other enterprises at
Subic.
	   Gordon and Estrada had once been friends, having studied in the
Jesuit-run Ateneo de Manila University. They were also among the
mayors removed by former President Corazon Aquino in 1986 following
a purge of officials who had worked with the late President
Ferdinand Marcos.

Ad agency withdraws Hitler potato chip commercials, posters

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An advertising agency Wednesday
terminated a TV-and-poster campaign using images of Nazi dictator
Adolf Hitler to sell potato chips following protests that the ads
were repugnant.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok, the Thai office of the Chicago-based Leo
Burnett agency, issued a statement reiterating apologies over the
ads and said they were ``never intended to cause any ill feeling.''
	   Commercials will be withdrawn from television immediately and
the more complicated removal of posters from thousands of tuk-tuks,
the three-wheeled motorized taxis plying Bangkok's streets, will be
completed by Sunday.
	   Avi Nil, charge d'affaires of the Israeli Embassy, praised the
agency for killing the ads once they became aware of how offensive
they were.
	   ``We're happy with this action,'' Nil said. ``If they had
realized the real meaning to people like us and other victims of
the Nazis, they would never have started in the first place.''
	   Nil said that the company's ``vigorous response shows there was
really no bad intention.''
	   Israeli officials viewed the ads as morally unacceptable, saying
Hitler should not be used as a means to make money. Hitler
unleashed World War II in Europe and killed millions of people,
including 6 million Jews, he considered subhuman, the worst
genocide the world has ever seen.
	   Simone Wheeler, a spokeswoman for Leo Burnett, said financial
details of the contract were confidential. No decision has been
made on how to replace the ads or on new screening procedures to
avoid a similar mistake in the future.
	   The commercial for X potato chips, targeted at Thai teen-agers,
depicts Hitler giving a Nazi salute and cuts to a woman who casts a
spell on him as he eats the chips, hoping to change his evil ways.
	   A Nazi swastika turns into the product logo as the
transformation is completed.
	   Leo Burnett said the ads, shown only in Thailand, were meant to
show the world would be a better place if happiness prevailed. The
chips are made by Food Processing Co. Ltd., a Thai firm.
	   Leo Burnett Bangkok apologized for the ads Sunday and had been
discussing the campaign, originally set to run through June, with
its client for the past few days.
	   ``The agency acknowledges Hitler as one of history's most
despicable dictators and never intended to suggest otherwise,'' the
statement said.
	   Nil has said the controversy should raise awareness about Hitler
among Thais. Consciousness about the Nazis is somewhat less in
Asia, where their armies did not reach, than in the West.
	   Thailand, a predominantly Buddhist country, has in the past
expressed outrage over ads using actors dressed as monks.

Ramos to give short lesson on economy to President-elect Estrada 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos will brief his successor President-elect Joseph Estrada on
the economy, the second in a series of meetings to help smoothen
the transition.
	   Ramos said the meeting on Monday will focus on the country's
macro-economic situation and the status of major infrastructure
projects.
	   He said the projects to be discussed include ``those that have
been completed, those that still ongoing, those that are about to
be packaged and perhaps for the implementation of the next
administration.''
	   The two leaders met last week at the military headquarters in
suburban Quezon City and discussed the country's security concerns.
	   The meetings will allow Estrada, Vice President-elect Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo and the rest of the incoming Cabinet to consult
with their counterparts on various ongoing projects.
	   Estrada was proclaimed last week as the country's 13th president
after his landslide victory in May 11 polls against 9 other
candidates, including Ramos' favorite, top legislator Jose de
Venecia, who finished a distant second.
	   Estrada, whose inauguration is slated for June 30, had

British walker falls to death in Spanish mountains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CABRALES, Spain (AP) _ The body of a British walker was
airlifted from a ravine in the Picos de Europa mountains in
northern Spain on Wednesday, a police spokesman said.
	   Louis Alexandrom Pigon, 56, slipped and fell 500 meters (yards)
into the ravine the previous afternoon after getting lost with two
other British tourists as they attempted to follow a Roman path
through the mountains, Vicente Lucas said.
	   His two companions alerted the emergency services when they
arrived close to midnight in the town of Cabrales, about 400
kilometers (250 miles) north west of Madrid, according to their
hotel receptionist Luis Perez.
	   A helicopter was sent out looking for Pigon, from Middlesex in
south east England, at first light Wednesday, Lucas said.

Second-largest Thai bank to recapitalize; baht rises bank to recapitalize.

Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with four grafs with second-largest Thai
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's second-largest commerical
bank plans a second round of capital increases to cope with rising
non-performing loans, the central bank governor said Wednesday.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, who is spearheading a shakeup of the Thai
financial sector since taking office a month ago, refused to
provide details on the offering for state-owned Krung Thai Bank.
	   The Manager, a local business daily, reported Wednesday that the
bank plans to raise 70 billion baht (dlrs 1.7 billion) in new
capital this year to prop up liquidity.
	   The move would mark the second time Krung Thai Bank has been
forced to raise capital since the Thai financial crisis erupted
last July and triggered a chain reaction of woes across Asia.
	   On Tuesday, the Bank of Thailand increased short-term interest
rates through the bond repurchase market Tuesday to stabilize the
baht, which had weakened from about 39 to the U.S. dollar last week
to close Tuesday at 42.05, its lowest level in 12 weeks.
	   The baht strengthened to 41.70 in early trading Wednesday, but
the rate hikes and profit-taking on bank and finance company stocks
sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand index down 0.43 points to close
at 313.21.
	   Thai firms struggling to survive the current economic crisis are
desperate for lower rates, but the crisis-stricken financial sector
has been reluctant to lend fresh money.
	   Earlier this year, the government seized four small commercial
banks deemed to be too ridden with debt to continue operations.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul said Tuesday that only one of the licenses
from the seized banks will be sold this year in an effort to ensure
the government receives a fair price. The other three licenses will
be sold over the next three years.
	   The U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Inc. is advising the Bank
of Thailand on how to handle the banks' assets. It is scheduled to
submit a proposal to the central bank later this month.

Singapore proposes harsh penalties to combat mosquitoes 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hoping to stem a rise in mosquito-borne
diseases like dengue fever and malaria, Singapore has proposed
heavy fines for those who allow the mosquitoes to breed on their
property, according to reports Wednesday.
	   A bill submitted in parliament Monday seeks to increase the
current fine by five times, to 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
3,000). Offenders also face three months in jail under existing
law.
	   The proposed Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act imposes a
10,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 6,000) fine and six months
incarceration for repeat offenders.
	   The tougher penalties appear to be aimed at construction sites,
where stagnant water attracts breeding mosquitoes, according to The
Straits Times.
	   The Aedes mosquito can carry the dengue virus, which causes
fever, joint pains, chills and in some strains, brain hemorrhaging
and death.
	   Cases of dengue fever in Singapore nearly doubled in the first
four months of 1998 to 1,780, compared to about 900 for the same
period last year.
	   This year's dengue increase came on the heels of a record 4,300
cases for the whole of last year.
	   Cases of malaria, which is transmitted by the bite of a female
Anopheles mosquito, rose 16 percent last year to 421 infections.

Chief of staff postponed trip to India following nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's armed forces chief of staff postponed
a visit to New Delhi to avoid appearances that Israel is siding
with India against Pakistan, an Israeli official said Wednesday.
	   Tensions between traditional rivals India and Pakistan have
grown considerably since both carried out nuclear tests last month.
	   India was the first to conduct the tests, and Pakistan
reportedly suspected Israel of plotting to launch an air strike
against the Pakistani nuclear reactor with India's help to thwart
Pakistani tests. Israeli officials have dismissed the allegations
as baseless.
	   Israel has relations with India, but not with Pakistan, the
first Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the Israeli armed forces chief of staff,
had planned to visit India this week. However, after India carried
out its nuclear tests, the Indian government was informed that
Shahak would like to postpone the visit, said an Israeli official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Yediot Ahronot daily said
no new date for a Shahak visit has been set.
	   Israeli officials feared that a Shahak visit at this time would
encourage baseless speculation in the Islamic world that Israel and
India are cooperating on the development of nuclear weapons, Yediot
said. Israel is widely believed to be an undeclared nuclear power.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, declined comment on the Yediot Ahronot report.
	   However, Israeli military analyst Reuven Pedatzur of the Galili
Center for Strategic and National Security confirmed Wednesday that
military ties between Israel and India have grown closer in the
past year. Pedatzur said the contacts are kept secret for the most
part.
	   U.S. media reported that a key scientist in India's nuclear
program, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, visited Israel several times in 1996
and 1997.
	   Foreign reports said Israel and India have set up projects in
several defense research areas, including guidance technology,
special materials and electronic warfare.
	   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday it would not discuss
military ties with other countries.
	   In 1996, Israel installed an air combat simulator at an Indian
training base for fighter pilots, India's first major defnese
purchase from Israel.

New Indonesian government abolishes Suharto's poverty tax 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has scrapped
a controversial presidential decree, which forced many individuals
and companies to donate two percent of their income to the poor,
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said Wednesday.
	   Former President Suharto issued the decree requiring individuals
and companies, whose net income exceeded 100 million rupiah, now
about dlrs 10,000 a year, to donate a portion of their income to
Yayasan Dana Mandiri, a foundation headed by Suharto.
	   The official news agency Antara quoted the Coordinating Minister
of Social Welfare Haryono Suyono Tuesday as saying that donations
will become voluntary if the decree is revoked.
	   Bambang added that the government will also cancel the decree
issued in 1988 that requires cigarette companies to donate one
rupiah per pack of cigarettes to the Indonesian Boy Scout
organization.
	   Suharto resigned on May 21 following protests and riots
triggered by the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Taiwan-China trade up slightly in first quarter 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Trade between Taiwan and China increased
1.3 percent in the first three months this year, and an economist
said Wednesday the gain illustrated China's ability to manage the
impact of Asia's financial crisis.
	   Taiwan's imports from China increased 18 percent to U.S. dlrs 1
billion during the period, while its exports fell 1.9 percent to
U.S. dlrs 4.3 billion, Taiwan's Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics said.
	   The government agency attributed the export decline to
competition from low-priced textile and plastic goods from South
Korea and Southeast Asian countries, whose currencies have been
sharply devalued in the crisis.
	   But it said Taiwanese exports of machinery and spare parts went
up 19 percent because China reinstated tax exemptions on equipment
imported by foreign investors.
	   China removed the tax incentives in 1996 to protect its domestic
industries, but reinstated them early this year because of a
slowdown in foreign investment, it said.
	   Chen Li-yin, an economist with the Chunghwa Institute of
Economic Research, said many Taiwanese investors began factory
construction and operations only after the incentives were
reinstated.
	   Chen said China may be able to withstand pressure to devalue its
currency as it continues to record trade surpluses and attract more
foreign investment.
	   To offset labor and production cost hikes, many Taiwanese
investors in labor-intensive industries have moved from China's
overly developed coastal regions to the interior, Chen said.
	   China and Taiwan do not recognize each other, and trade is
mostly conducted through Hong Kong.

Rockets slam into residential area, killing 6 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Two rockets slammed into a residential
area of the Afghan capital on Wednesday morning, killing six
members of the same family, Taliban officials said.
	   Several more people where injured when the rockets pounded
Shar-e-Now neighborhood of Kabul, a congested part of the
beleaguered city.
	   This was the deadliest rocket attack on the city in nearly a
year. The rockets came from the direction of the front line, north
of Kabul, where the Taliban religious army faces off against its
rivals belonging to the northern-based alliance.
	   Taliban officials said the rockets belonged to the opposition,
but it wasn't immediately clear whether the rockets went astray or
whether they were aimed at residential areas.
	   The nearest front line to Kabul is barely 20 kilometers (12
miles) away, well within rocket range of opposition soldiers.
Previously the opposition attempted to hit only the airport to stop
the daily bombing raids by Taliban jets on their positions.
	   The Taliban controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan, while the
alliance the northern 15 percent of the country, including the
rugged mountain region where a deadly earthquake struck on Saturday
killing as many as 5,000 people.
	   Since Taliban troops threw out the former military chief Ahmed
Shah Massood from Kabul in September 1996, the city of barely
750,000 people has been relatively peaceful.
	   While Massood and Afghanistan's President Burhanuddin Rabbani
ruled Kabul between 1992 and 1996 the city was under almost
constant siege by rival Muslim groups who daily lobbed rockets into
the city.
	   It is estimated that 50,000 people -- most of them civilians --
died during that period when Rabbani was battling rival groups, led
by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and former communist general Rashid Dostum.

U.S.-based ORBIS concludes ophthalmic program in Jordan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The world's flying eye hospital, ORBIS,
completed Wednesday three weeks of an ophthalmic exchange program
in Jordan in which surgeries and lectures were conducted aboard a
DC-10 plane.
	   Amyna Merchant, a medical volunteer from Pakistan, told
reporters that 340 patients were screened and 66 of them underwent
surgery to treat retina, cornea and cataract diseases.
	   ``They were the most complicated cases that required high
technology and expertise,'' Merchant said, adding that 30 corneal
tissues were donated by U.S. eye banks to patients in Jordan ``as a
gentle gesture.''
	   ORBIS has a team of volunteer doctors, anesthetists, nurses and
biomedical engineers from the the United States, Sweden, India,
England, Philippines, Burma, France and Pakistan.
	   The aircraft is serviced by United Airlines. It is a complete
eye hospital with 16 cameras, an examination and laser room,
operating room, recovery room, sterilization room, audio-visual
studio and a 52-seat classroom.
	   ORBIS, which is Latin for eye and Greek for around the world, is
a non-profit organization established in 1982 in New York with
offices in Houston, London and Hong Kong.
	   Over the years, it has carried out 350 programs in 79 countries,
including Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Bulgaria, China, Sudan and Mongolia.

United States to allocate dlrs 5 million for new Georgian refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States will allocate an
additional dlrs 5 million to Georgia this year to help 38,000
refugees who fled fighting in the breakaway region of Abkhazia last
week, officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. Ambassador-at-large Stephen Sestanovich announced the new
aid after meeting with Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
other officials late Tuesday.
	   The United States will raise its aid to Georgia from dlrs 100
million to dlrs 160 million, and dlrs 5 million of the new funds
will be earmarked for the refugees, Shevardnadze spokesman Vakhtang
Abashidze said.
	   The European Union will also provide 200,000 ECU (dlrs 180,000)
for the refugees, said EU Foreign affairs Commissioner Hans van den
Broek, who met with Shevardnadze on Wednesday.
	   Abashidze did not say what the rest of the new aid would be used
for.
	   People who fled last week's fighting in Abkhazia included some
30,000 ethnic Georgians who had returned to their homes in Abkhazia
only recently after fleeing during a 1992-93 war.
	   More than 300 Abkhazians and 16 Georgians were killed in clashes
May 19-25 between Abkhazian armed units and Georgian guerrillas,
Shevardnadze has said.
	   The bodies of 11 Georgians have been exchanged for two Abkhazian
suspects who had been held in Georgian prisons, Georgian state
television reported.
	   Meanwhile, the executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, Boris Berezovsky, met with Abkhazian leader
Vladislav Ardzinba in Abkhazia's Black Sea town of Gagra on
Wednesday to discuss possibilities for a peace settlement.
	   Abkhazia insists it's an independent state, but Georgia insists
it will only grant the province broad autonomy, not sovereignty.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian presidential envoys were meeting in
Moscow on Wednesday to try to arrange direct talks between
Shevardnadze and Ardzinba.
	   They also discussed a mine blast that took place Tuesday in the
buffer zone, which killed six police officers and employees of the
Abkhazian Security Service, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Abkhazian security chief Astamur Tarba accused Georgian secret
services of planting the mine, while Georgian officials suggested
it was a ``provocation'' designed to scuttle the peace process.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war, and fighting erupts
frequently in the region.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rival political parties made
last-minute efforts Wednesday to woo voters on the eve of local
elections seen as a referendum on the performance of President Kim
Dae-jung.
	   Kim, whose minority government is grappling with a massive
economic reform package, sought a strong mandate in Thursday's
local elections to select mayors, provincial governors and local
council members.
	   But polls showed that as many as 30 percent of the country's
32.5 million eligible voters have not made their choices, only a
few days before the voting day.
	   Election experts predicted that less than 60 percent of the
eligible voters would cast their ballots. The voter turnout was
80.7 percent in December's presidential voting.
	   The watchdog Central Election Management Committee attributed
the voter apathy to deepening economic woes that have eclipsed
political issues.
	   ``We urge the people to give us power necessary to complete
reforms and save the economy,'' said Kim's minority National
Congress for New Politics in a statement.
	   Kim says the majority opposition is blocking his reform measures
aimed at bringing South Korea's battered economy back to health.
	   The opposition charged that policy failures of the
three-month-old Kim government are pushing South Korea deeper into
trouble.
	   Since the country called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to bail out its economy, inflation and unemployment have
been rising sharply. The number of jobless people has doubled to
more than 1.5 million.
	   ``Let's punish the arrogant and incompetent ruling party,'' said
Cho Sun, head of the majority opposition Grand National Party,
during a campaign rally Wednesday.
	   In Thursday's polls, about 10,200 candidates are vying for 4,428
mayors, governors and local council seats.
	   The results will be largely influenced by regionalism, experts
said. South Korea is a fairly homogeneous society, but politics
often bring out strong regional sentiment. The last days of
campaigning have been marred by charges of regionalism.
	   In one of the most fiercely fought campaign battles, Ko Kun, a
former prime minister representing Kim's ruling party, was leading
the race for Seoul mayor with a comfortable margin over Choi
Byung-yul, the opposition candidate, according to polls.
	   Rival candidates were running neck and neck for the
gubernatorial job at the populous Kyonggi Province surrounding
Seoul.

Philippine Airlines, American Airlines Code-Sharing Approved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Wednesday
the U.S. Department of Transportation has approved its code-sharing
agreement with American Airlines.
	   The approval paves the way for the launching of joint services
by the two airlines as early as August, an arrangement that would
likely result in cost savings for both, PAL said.
	   PAL said the two airlines will jointly operate scheduled
services between Manila and five major U.S. points _ Chicago,
Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, New York and Washington D.C. _ via either
Los Angeles or San Francisco.
	   PAL will fly passengers on the Manila-Los Angeles and the
Manila-San Francisco legs, while American Airlines will operate
flights to the five U.S. points from Los Angeles and San Francisco.
	   It would mean seamless travel between Manila and the five U.S.
points for transpacific passengers, PAL said.
	   The two airlines are working out the operational aspects of the
code-sharing agreement, particularly those dealing on the
automation enhancements necessary to ensure the transition of
passengers between the carriers' respective services, PAL said.
	   Financial details of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Indonesia's new leader says he's unconcerned about past corruption Some Indonesians use only one name With Indonesia-Riot Toll 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's new president says
cash-strapped Indonesians should concentrate on economic and
political reforms rather than focusing on the riches of former
leader Suharto that many believe were accumulated illegally.
	   ``My role here is to bring in the shortest time possible the
economy back and to improve the democracy,'' President B.J. Habibie
said in an interview that CNN broadcast Wednesday.
	   In a separate interview with The New York Times, Habibie said he
did not favor digging into the source of billions amassed by
Suharto's family. The Times quoted Habibie as saying Indonesians
should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice by trying to seize the
former president's assets.
	   Critics have accused Suharto of allowing his family to amass
fortunes and to build massive business empires through nepotism and
corruption.
	   The government this week launched a broad probe into state
corruption, but many want a specific investigation into Suharto's
wealth, estimated at dlrs 20 billion to dlrs 40 billion.
	   Some want that money used to help fix the country's worst
economic crisis in three decades.
	   Habibie also defended his own family's wealth, saying its
members were highly educated and talented, and had earned their
money fairly.
	   Suharto appears to have turned his back on Habibie, who replaced
him last month, the Times said. Suharto, who ruled for 32 years,
refused to meet him before stepping down and has not communicated
with him since the handover of power, the newspaper said.
	   ``One thing President Suharto has always told me _ because for
me he is like an older brother, and sometimes like a father, but
for sure a good friend ... he told me: `My dear Rudi, one day a lot
of people will be looking at you. ... You will be the most lonesome
man in the world, because you will have to face your own
decisions.' And I faced that,'' he told the Times.
	   Habibie also revealed in the Times interview that there were
concerns about his personal safety in the days following Suharto's
resignation. After removing Suharto's son-in-law from a top
military post, Habibie and his family were moved to a safe house as
a precaution.
	   The Suharto son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo, accepted the demotion,
but remains an unknown factor politically.
	   Habibie, 61, has known Suharto since boyhood and was a Suharto
Cabinet minister for 20 years. Despite his close links to the old
government, Habibie insisted his administration was a departure
from the past.
	   ``You could never talk to President Suharto the way you can talk
to me,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I am not the king.''
	   Habibie, who took power when Suharto resigned following riots
and protests last month, declined to say whether he would run for
re-election after parliamentary elections are held next year.
	   Habibie said he had no option but to reform Indonesia's battered
economy while introducing sweeping political change, saying both
were interlinked. He said, however, that Indonesia is ``not a
jungle,'' telling the Times that the only route to a smooth
transfer of power is through a complicated procedure leading to a
parliamentary election next year.
	   He said most of Indonesia's 202 million people are suffering
badly from an inflation rate of more than 50 percent and soaring
unemployment. He told CNN that many don't care who is the president
but instead worry about ``their rice bowls, their homes, to live in
peace, the future for their children.''
	   In the CNN interview, he likened his newfound role as a reformer
to that of leaders Boris Yeltsin in Russia and Zhu Rongji of China.
Both leaders brought sweeping reforms to their countries despite
being part of old authoritarian regimes.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels captured the garrison town
of Ulu, on the road to a dam that provides most of Khartoum's
electricity, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The rebels defeated two government brigades in a daylong battle
Tuesday for Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of the
capital, said George Garang, spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   At least 72 government troops were killed, he said. No figures
on rebel casualties were provided.
	   The government had no immediate comment on the rebel claim.
	   Ulu is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of Damazin
and the Roseires dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's
electricity. The dam is about 500 kilometers (315 miles) southeast
of Khartoum.
	   In Cairo, SPLA representative Daniel Kodi Angelo said the
rebels' next target was a government oil exploration operation at
Khor Adar, 52 miles (83 kilometers) west of Ulu.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

In desperate bid to raise cash, Russia offers rare treasury bills auction results, EDITS, TRIMS.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government issued rare one-week
treasury bills Wednesday in a desperate attempt to refill its
drained coffers and stabilize its turbulent financial markets.
	   The move is one of a number of measures the Kremlin hopes will
resolve Russia's financial crisis, which was marked by a steep drop
in the stock market last week and threatened to trigger a costly
devaluation of the ruble.
	   However, the stock exchange has regained significant ground in
the past two days, rising 12 percent Tuesday to wipe out the
previous day's 10 percent drop. That climb continued Wednesday,
with the market climbing another 9 percent by early afternoon.
	   Moreover, the ruble has been steady in recent days without major
support from Central Bank, which says it has plenty of reserves
left to prevent a run on the currency.
	   Altogether, the Russian stock market is down about 50 percent
from the beginning of the year _ the world's worst performance and
a sharp change from the previous year's record growth of 98
percent.
	   The new treasury bills offered Wednesday are designed to raise
quick cash so Russia can keep up with payments on its existing debt
and reassure investors that it will not default.
	   The government sold most of the issue by midday, agreeing to
one-week yields of an average 40 percent.
	   ``This indicates reasonably strong demand,'' said Robert Devane,
head of fixed income at Moscow brokerage Troika-Dialog.
	   Devane said rumors of an international aid package for Russia
have soothed the markets. Longer-term treasury bills were also
offered during the weekly auction, which the government hoped would
raise about dlrs 16.5 billion.
	   Russia's government has a serious cash flow problem, largely
because it has been unable to create an effective tax collection
system. As a result it has borrowed heavily to finance the
resulting federal budget deficit.
	   Nonetheless there has been too little cash in the system to pay
state workers and pensioners on time, a situation that led to a
wave of labor strikes last week.
	   The government has blamed those strikes, combined with lingering
nerves over the Asian financial crisis and a drop in world prices
for Russia's main exports of oil and gas, for triggering last
week's stock collapse.
	   Speculation is growing that Russia will be offered a rescue
package from the International Monetary Fund or its colleagues in
the G-8. Deputy finance ministers from the so-called Group of Eight
industrialized democracies were to confer on the issue by telephone
Wednesday.
	   But Kremlin officials have denied requesting such aid, saying
they would prefer to fix their problems themselves by reducing
government spending and improving tax collection.
	   Wednesday's auction is the first time Russia has ever offered
one-week treasury bills _ an extremely short term. Most Russian
treasury bills are for several months or a year, while terms in the
West can reach 30 years.

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ A major Serb assault on ethnic Albanian
villages in Kosovo drove a new wave of refugees into Albania and
sent thousands more seeking the safety of border highlands, news
reports said Wednesday.
	   Albania's state-run ATA news agency said between 1,500-2,000
refugees crossed overnight into Albania, and another 3,000 were
approaching the border.
	   A refugee ATA did not identify said as many as 50,000 more were
on the Kosovo side of the hills separating the Serbian province
from Albania. They were also walking toward the border, said the
report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Local authorities in northeastern Albania, site of most of the
crossings, said that with more refugees arriving by the hour, the
25 tons of aid sent Tuesday by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees was not sufficient to feed the masses.
	   The refugee influx first began growing late last week as Serb
police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army stepped up their
campaign to crush the pro-separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers after
years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the
secessionist southern province, where ethnic Albanians represent 90
percent of the population of 2.2 million.
	   Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees fleeing
to neighboring Albania described artillery bombardments that forced
out entire villages and house-burnings they said were clearly
intended to drive them out.
	   There have been no reports like those in Bosnia of massive
civilian roundups or massacres in the Kosovo campaign, which the
Serbs insist targets guerrillas.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted increasing comparisons to the
ethnic war in Bosnia and its atrocities. More than 200 people have
been killed in the province in the past three months.
	   The growing violence has sparked alarm among Western powers that
the fighting could spill over into neighboring Balkan nations.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton told a visiting delegation of ethnic
Albanians in Washington last week that the United States ``shall
not tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo.''
	   But the West repeatedly has failed to get Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and has
yet to devise a strategy for how to resolve the worsening conflict.
	   A NATO official in Brussels, Belgium, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the alliance was ``preoccupied'' with Kosovo and
would debate what to do at a NATO Council meeting Wednesday.
	   Those concerns prompted NATO last week to consider possible
troop deployments in Albania and Macedonia. But Russia said Tuesday
that NATO cannot post troops in Albania without the approval of the
United Nations.
	   Based on information from the refugees and ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo, the latest campaign is concentrated in the
western region of Decani, where the Serbs deployed thousands of
additional paramilitary forces and are pulverizing 10 towns and
villages with artillery.
	   The town of Decani, with a population of about 20,000, was in
ruins with no sign of life, according to the pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center. Dead cattle littered the streets, the center
said.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army controls as much as a third of
the province, several refugees said they saw no sign of it in the
sealed-off area under siege by Serb forces.
	   Communications with western Kosovo remained cut off. But a
monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
who spoke on condition of anonymity said on Tuesday military action
in the area around the border appeared to have declined.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders publicly acknowledged the existence of
the Kosovo Liberation Army for the first time Tuesday, noting that
the ``massive Serb aggression is meeting heavy resistance'' from
the people and the KLA.

Abacha silent on proposed U.S. visit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha has not
indicated whether he will meet with a senior U.S. State Department
delegation scheduled to arrive in Nigeria later this week.
	   There has been no response either positive or negative from
Abacha, western sources said Wednesday
	   The United States is still negotiating with Abacha's ruling
military junta on the visit.
	   The Lagos-based Daily Times reported earlier this week Abacha
would not meet with the U.S. officials, but the newspaper cited no
sources nor evidence to support the report.
	   Plans for the State Department visit, headed by former U.S.
ambassador to Nigeria Thomas Pickering, were announced last week as
part of Washington's effort to urge Abacha to embrace genuine
democratic reform.
	   Abacha seized power in a bloodless 1993 coup that was widely
condemned in the international community.
	   Although the military has pledged to hand over power to an
elected government later this year, Abacha in April became the only
candidate for president in a nomination process that critics say
was rigged and manipulated.
	   Washington has described Nigeria's political transition process
as ``flawed and failing.''
	   ``We do not see how the current process will lead to a
democratically elected civilian government,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said last week.
	   The decision to send Pickering to Nigeria could be aimed at
clarifying American policy on Africa's most populous country.

Regional worries batter Philippine stocks; peso edges higher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares fell for a ninth
straight session Wednesday, battered by continuing foreign selling
on concerns over economic prospects for the Asian region, market
participants said.
	   Most countries in the region have reported contractions in their
economies in the first quarter as a result of the Asian financial
crisis. The Philippines' gross national product slowed but still
managed 2.5 percent growth for the period.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index declined 17.09
points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,928.99 after losing 49.97 points on
Tuesday.
	   It now has lost 219.62 points, or more than 10 percent, in the
past nine sessions.
	   Ramon Lucas, a trader for Kim Eng Securities, said foreign
brokerage houses were aggressively selling big capital issues,
particularly those still near recent highs.
	   ``Not a single local broker made it to the list of the top 10
most active brokers,'' he said.
	   Overall, there seems to be more bad news on the horizon for the
region than good news, said Hansley See, an analyst for Abacus
Securities Corp.
	   He said the unraveling of the political situation in Indonesia
and the possible removal of the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S.
dollar are among the possible bad events that could further
aggravate the situation in the region.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed higher against the U.S.
dollar, buoyed by gains in the Japanese yen which lifted regional
currencies.
	   The dollar averaged 38.942 pesos, down from 39.396 pesos on
Tuesday.
	   Dealers said that if the environment for regional currencies
remains benign, the peso could edge toward the sensitive level of
38.50 pesos to the dollar in coming days.
	   Demand for dollars has been light since the May 11 national
elections. Political uncertainty in the runup to the polls caused
heavy forward buying of the dollar.

Blatter promises to bring World Cup to Africa 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ FIFA presidential hopeful Joseph
Blatter took to the campaign trail in battle-scarred Liberia,
repeating his pledge to award the 2006 World Cup to an African
country.
	   Blatter, who met with local soccer officials and Liberian star
George Weah, also promised to increase funding to sport programs in
this West African country which in 1996 emerged from seven years of
civil war.
	   Blatter, who is currently FIFA secretary general, was invited to
Liberia by Weah, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters.
	   ``I will not give you all of my programs for Africa right
here,'' Blatter said. ``What I can promise is that if elected
president of FIFA on June 8, I will give the 2006 World Cup to
Africa.''
	   Blatter expressed deep gratitude when Liberia Football
Association president Edwin Snowe promised his country would vote
for the FIFA presidential candidate.
	   ``If you get only one vote at the election, you can rest assured
that vote will be from Liberia,'' Snowe said.

Hong Kong focuses on economic woes with high-level meetings thruout

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Faced with a united demand for action from Hong
Kong's political parties, the government on Wednesday announced a
12-point program to create 100,000 jobs and stimulate the
recession-bound economy.
	   Politicians, economists, business leaders and labor unionists
all said they doubted whether the program was enough to get the
economy moving. And the official who announced the package
cautioned Hong Kong not to expect too much.
	   Political parties from across Hong Kong's spectrum reached
consensus on their own six-point program in a separate meeting.
With unemployment at 14-year high and the economy shrinking for the
first time in nearly 13 years, the parties said the government
should ``put money back in people's pockets.''
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told reporters after the first
employment task force meeting that the government will push ahead
infrastructure projects and expand maintenance, as well as social
services. It also will improve education and employment retraining,
he said.
	   The task force, including government officials, academics, and
representatives from business and unions, will meet regularly,
Tsang said.
	   In keeping with the government's view that there is only a
limited amount it can do to improve the economy, Tsang told the
public to not expect immediate relief.
	   ``We cannot create jobs just for the sake of creating jobs,'' he
said. ``We must ensure the international community and (Hong Kong)
that the ... government has not abandoned financial prudence.''
	   Unemployment is officially 3.9 percent, although unions say the
figure is much higher. It is expected to increase as Hong Kong,
which avoided the worst of Asia's economic crisis for nearly a
year, settles into recession.
	   The economy contracted 2 percent in the first quarter of the
year, and one senior official said late Tuesday that it would
likely shrink in the second quarter, too. That technically would
put Hong Kong in recession.
	   Cheng Yiu-tong, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, a
task force member, said the government package was a step forward,
but ``too small and too powerless.''
	   Another member, clothing retailer Michael Tien, said he was
satisfied with the package, but added that ``the government can't
help much in a crisis in a free market.''
	   Impatient with the government, seven major political parties
held their own economic summit. The meeting included government
critics, pro-business parties that generally support the
government, and grassroots pro-China parties. Together, they won
more than two-thirds of the seats May 24 in Hong Kong's new
legislature.
	   Their ability to bridge differences could mean that, despite
being controlled by pro-business and pro-China elites, the
legislature may give Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa a hard time on
economic issues.
	   ``The government is wealthy,'' said Allen Lee, chairman of the
pro-business Liberal Party, who chaired the meeting. ``It's the
citizens who don't have money.''
	   The parties' proposals included cuts in public transportation
charges and government fees, and more assistance to small- and
medium-sized businesses that form the backbone of Hong Kong's
economy.
	   They also want a review of required tax prepayment. To create
jobs, they say the government should push ahead infrastructure
projects and provide more social services.
	   The government also should find ways to hold down interest
rates, which have remained high to defend Hong Kong's link to the
U.S. dollar, the representatives said.
	   Lee said the parties would back a deficit budget next year if
neccessary.

Central bank issues silver World Cup coin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's central bank on Wednesday
issued a silver coin with an engraved soccer net to commemorate the
upcoming World Cup.
	   The symbolic sum of lei 100 (dlrs 0.011) with the zeros as
soccer balls, is written inside the net on one side. The Eiffel
Tower and the words ``World Cup France - 1998'' adorn the flip
side, Central Bank official Nicolae Mitea said by telephone.
	   Mitea said each coin weighs 27 grams (0.8 ounces) and has a
retail value of 132,000 leid (dlrs 16).
	   The bank distributed 5,000 coins to bank branches nationwide
Wednesday.
	   ``Their numismatic value will increase in time,'' Mitea said.
	   Romania and England are considered the front-runners in World
Cup Group G, which also includes Colombia and Tunisia.

Cambodia's King Sihanouk meets with former Khmer Rouge nemesis 
</HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk
granted an audience Wednesday to Ieng Sary, a former high-ranking
Khmer Rouge leader who was his jailer in the late 1970s.
	   A palace source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
the king cordially received Ieng Sary, whom he reluctantly pardoned
in 1996 to ensure the breakup of the Khmer Rouge, for an hour at
his palace in the northwestern town of Siem Reap.
	   Ieng Sary oversaw the house arrest of the king during the Khmer
Rouge's genocidal rule.
	   In the past, Sihanouk has called Ieng Sary a ``psychopath'' and
shown contempt for his uncouth manner and failure to show respect
when Sihanouk was a nominal ally of the Khmer Rouge in the early
1970s before he became their prisoner.
	   Ieng Sary, for his part, has described how the guerrillas used
an alliance with Sihanouk to help win power, once likening him to a
``water buffalo who will help us cross the river.''
	   At least 14 of the king's relatives and children died under
Khmer Rouge rule.
	   Details of the meeting were not available.
	   Ieng Sary was accompanied by Ei Chhean, his second-in-command at
stronghold of Pailin in western Cambodia, the source said.
	   The audience was the first meeting between the king and Ieng
Sary since Sihanouk granted him amnesty in 1996 for crimes against
humanity. It was a political deal undertaken to ensure the eventual
defection of some 10,000 war-weary Khmer Rouge guerrillas to the
government.
	   The defections marked the beginning of the end for the Khmer
Rouge, which is now down to a few hundred guerrillas along the Thai
border. Their longtime leader, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary's brother-in-law,
died of a purported heart attack April 15.
	   Pol Pot had been deposed as leader by other guerrillas last
year. His death has spurred new calls by human-rights groups and
some Western governments, led by the United States, for the trial
of remaining Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   Ieng Sary, who was foreign minister under Pol Pot and a member
of the group's inner circle, is likely to stay protected because of
the 1996 amnesty. He has offered to stand trial knowing he will
probably never face a court hearing.
	   Sihanouk was toppled by a U.S.-backed coup in 1970 and lent his
support to the Khmer Rouge, then a small band of jungle guerrillas,
against the new government. But he quickly became their pawn.
	   After seizing power in 1975, the Khmer Rouge turned Cambodia
into a slave labor camp and caused the deaths of as many as 2
million people.
	   A Vietnamese invasion overthrew them in 1979, but they continued
to wage guerrilla warfare against successive central governments.

	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A man was killed Wednesday in an
explosion at a chemical plant owned by oil giant Shell. Emergency
services took 14 people to a medical center for observation, Shell
spokesman Martin Brokers said.
	   The explosion happened as contractors were cleaning an empty
tank used to store methyl tertiar butyl ether, a replacement for
lead in gasoline. The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
	   There was no fire reported after the 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) blast at
the Pernis refinery in Rotterdam, Brokers said. No dangerous fumes
were believed to have been released.
	   Pernis is one of Europe's largest refineries.

In protective gear, U.N. experts search for Iraqi missile warheads

<TEXT>
	   Al-NIBAI, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors on Wednesday
searched through reeds and sand dunes for missing missile parts in
a bid to verify Iraq's claims that it has buried all its biological
and chemical missile warheads.
	   Some 27 experts, under German Jean Jano, split into three groups
early in the morning _ some wearing protective suits, masks, boots
and gloves _ and began a probe for the missing missiles pieces.
	   Others supervised an earth-moving machine as it uncovered the
nose cone of a missile warhead. ``This belongs to a conventional
warhead,'' shouted an Iraqi engineer.
	   Al-Nibai is 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Baghdad. In 1991,
Iraq chose to destroy a great number of its long-range missiles and
bury them there rather than declare them to U.N inspectors.
	   ``We hope that this work will help to settle some of the still
outstanding issues concerning the missile warheads,'' Jano, 61,
told The Associated Press.
	   The area where Iraq unilaterally buried its missiles instead of
declaring them to the inspectors is vast and the experts have with
them latest metal detectors to determine where exactly the parts
lie.
	   ``We've with us some of the latest state-of-the-art high-tech
equipment,'' Vincent Murphy, a U.S. geophysicist told the AP.
	   Experts with magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors nailed small,
red flags on the ground to determine where the next digging should
be. ``It is all digitally recorded. The data is brought back in the
recorder to one of the vehicles and downloaded to the laptop,''
said Murphy, a 69-year-old geophysicist from Boston.
	   He said the advanced equipment is needed because no aerial
photography or satellite images will penetrate the type of soil at
al-Nibai.
	   Jano, an aerodynamics expert, said inspectors have found ``for
instance, aluminum canisters that are used for chemical agents and
some stainless steel canisters... used for biological agents.'' But
he would not say what they have collected so far is sufficient to
verify Iraqi claims.
	   He said another team of experts will arrive in Baghdad soon to
analyze the findings, now stored at Taji, a military camp 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad.
	   Accounting for special warheads is one of the main hurdles in
Iraq's efforts to declare itself clean of prohibited missiles with
ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Senior Iraqi officers looked on as the experts, in white
protective suits, moved around. The Iraqis refuse to wear safety
gear, saying there is nothing toxic about the pieces of scrap
underground.
	   U.N. monitors' suits are burned every day. Inspectors are also
under instructions to wash their hands and feet in a bleach
solution before leaving the site.
	   Jano would not say how many missiles and warheads Iraq buried in
Al-Nabai. He would also shun questions on whether the current
excavation scheduled to end on June 18 will remove U.N. doubts
about the warheads.
	   But Jano said he hoped to do all that is required from him by
the end of his mission in the light of ``excellent cooperation'' he
has been receiving from the Iraqi side.
	   At the United Nations, Iraqi officials tried Tuesday to convince
the Security Council that Baghdad had met the terms for ending
economic sanctions by destroying all illegal weapons. U.S. and
British diplomats said they remained unconvinced.
	   Destroying all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons is the main condition for the council to end the
crippling sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

Morocco may skip African summit meetings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Morocco's delegates to the
Organization of African Unity failed to appear at preliminary
meetings this week and may boycott next week's summit, an OAU
official said Wednesday.
	   Delegates attending the pan-African OAU preparatory meetings
this week in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, discussed the
summit agenda, which may include a debate on membership for Western
Sahara.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official from the OAU
secretariat said Morocco is no longer expected to attended the
summit meetings.
	   Morocco has administered Western Sahara since 1976 when the
territory as abandoned by its colonial ruler Spain. Morocco is
trying to quash an independence movement in Western Sahara and has
boycotted past OAU functions in protest over discussions on the
territory's sovereignty.
	   Moroccan flags flying next to those of other OAU member states
have been removed from Ouagadougou's streets, indicating their
delegates will not attend the summit meetings.
	   A referendum later this year will seek to determine the fate of
Western Sahara. U.N. observers have been deployed in the region
since 1991 to oversee a cease-fire between Moroccan forces and
Western Saharan rebels.
	   Western Sahara _ known then as the Democratic Republic of Arab
Saharaoui _ was admitted briefly as a sovereign member of the OAU,
prompting Morocco to boycott the group in 1984.
	   Most member state of the OAU have since dropped their
recognition of Western Sahara.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ The apartheid state's most notorious
killer testified Wednesday in former President P.W. Botha's trial
that white-led governments had ordered black activists killed and
denounced his former leaders as ``cowards.''
	   A major problem came home to roost for Botha when former police
Col. Eugene de Kock arrived under guard in an armored personnel
carrier in a police convoy at the courthouse, where the former
president is on trial for refusing to appear before a panel probing
apartheid crimes.
	   The case has turned into an examination of Botha's possible
complicity in state-sanctioned killings and violence when he was
head of state from 1978-1989 and presided over the State Security
Council, which coordinated the crackdown against opponents of white
rule.
	   Standing in the witness dock just 10 feet from Botha, de Kock
was asked by prosecutor Bruce Morrison for his interpretation of
the words ``eliminate'' and ``neutralize,'' used in State Security
Council meetings in reference to how to deal with opponents of
apartheid.
	   ``In the terminology that they used it means killing,'' said de
Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the nickname Prime Evil.
	   When Morrison asked de Kock how he felt about serving two life
sentences plus 212 years for murder and other crimes while the
leaders of the apartheid-era governments were free, de Kock voice
quivered with anger as he spat out his response.
	   ``They want to eat lamb but they don't want to see the blood and
the guts,'' de Kock said ``They are cowards. They will remain
that.''
	   Botha, wearing a grey business suit, looked on impassively.
	   De Kock, a decorated former commander of the Vlakplaas police
unit that assassinated black activists, did not mention the
82-year-old Botha by name. But the implication was clear.
	   De Kock also recalled receiving the Police Star for Outstanding
Service for bombing the London headquarters of the African National
Congress in 1982. De Kock testified that the medal was normally
only awarded to generals, and that only the head of state _ Botha
at the time _ could authorize it.
	   Aiding the case against Botha could earn de Kock points in his
own amnesty application with the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel which Botha refused to testify before.
	   If Botha, by snubbing the panel, had intended to avoid public
scrutiny of apartheid-era atrocities, it has backfired.
	   Earlier testimony on his trial this week focused on the 1988
bombing of Khotso House, the Johannesburg headquarters of the South
African Council of Churches, which opposed apartheid. A former head
of South Africa's police has testified that Botha ordered the
bombing. De Kock testified that he placed the bombs in the basement
of the building.
	   Asked by Morrison if the government had disapproved of such
actions, de Kock said: ``No they did not. They actually encouraged
it.''
	   Apartheid-era government leaders claim such attacks were the
work of rogue operatives.
	   Early Wednesday, Botha's defense team cross-examined two
witnesses to the Khotso House bombing: security guard Welcome
Ntumba and the former leader of the Methodist Church in South
Africa, the Rev. Peter Storey.
	   Defense attorney Lappe Laubscher, who had opposed the calling of
the witnesses as irrelevant to the charges, declined to ask any
questions.
	   Storey, who lives in Delaware, Ohio, asked the court to pursue
whoever was responsible for the attack.
	   ``I have come a long way to give evidence here and I hope that
there will
	   be clarification about who stands accountable for the
explosion,'' he said. ``It was in my view the most violent act by
the apartheid state against the church of God.''
	   Botha denies he ordered the bombing.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the ANC, which had been waging a guerrilla
campaign against apartheid.
	   The talks culminated in the nation's first all-race elections in
1994, which the ANC won.

Second bomb explodes in Tehran, no injuries reported 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tensions mounted Wednesday, a day after bomb
attacks on government sites killed at least three people in
northern Tehran.
	   State-run radio reported a bomb explosion at a government
building in northern Tehran late Tuesday, but did not say if there
were any casualties or give the cause of the blast, nor did it
identify the government building.
	   But the Iraq-based Iranian opposition, Mujahedeen Khalq, claimed
responsibility for a bomb that exploded Tuesday at the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's office in Tehran. In a statement
Wednesday, the Mujahedeen, the largest Iranian opposition group,
said it also carried out two mortar attacks late Tuesday on
military facilities in the capital.
	   At least three people were killed and two injured in the
prosecutor's office explosion, according to official sources
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Mujahedeen said the attacks were in retaliation for the
killing of its members in recent months by the Iranian government.
	   The group said it launched two mortar attacks late Tuesday on
the Central Command Headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, where ``several Revolutionary Guards were killed or
wounded, and the headquarters' buildings were damaged,'' the group
said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates.
	   An hour later, it attacked the Defense Industries Organization
but did not claim any casualties, it said.
	   However, Iranian radio said security men foiled an attempted
attack by ``saboteurs'' at the headquarters of the IRGC on Tuesday,
but gave no other details. It said the perpetrators fled.
	   The three victims of Tuesday's explosion, including an Armenian
named Wilhelm Vigen who worked as a technician at the prosecutor's
office building, were buried Wednesday following funeral services
in Tehran.
	   Newspapers reported contradictory casualty figures. One said
five people were killed, another reported nine people also were
injured. The Gozaresh'e Rooz daily said two women and three men
were killed.
	   Meanwhile, sources said police evacuated guests and staff at the
Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran early Wednesday following a bomb
threat made by a caller. No bomb was found at the hotel, which is
close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   A police official at the scene said the explosion at the
prosecutor's office was caused by a bomb placed in a briefcase.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the blast was
caused by explosives and indicated the material was being brought
to the court as evidence in a case under investigation when it went
off accidentally.
	   But Tehran television and radio only reported an explosion, with
no further details.
	   Bombings are rare in Tehran where security is tightly
controlled. The last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago
when two devices went off in a commercial district but caused no
fatalities. Those explosions remain a mystery.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and move
on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets recovered slightly
Wednesday on a stronger yen and a technical rebound after heavy
recent losses. But stocks in Indonesia slid amid concern over the
domestic economic and political situation. Despite the rallies in
many areas, market players remained pessimistic as foreign funds
continued to pull out on concerns over Asia's dismal economic
prospects. Most countries have reported a contraction in their
economies in the first quarter as a result of the regional
financial crisis. Meanwhile, more student demonstrations Wednesday
hurt market sentiment in Indonesia, dealers said. Jakarta's
benchmark JSX composite index suffered a 1.7 percent drop to close
at 392.608 points. In Tokyo, stocks also fell amid lingering
pessimism in the outlook of Japan's economy, after the 1.52-percent
rally the previous day. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average shed 207.45 points, or 1.33 percent, to close at 15,347.00.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government issued rare one-week
treasury bills Wednesday in a desperate attempt to refill its
drained coffers and stabilize its turbulent financial markets. The
move is one of a number of measures the Kremlin hopes will resolve
Russia's financial crisis, which was marked by a steep drop in the
stock market last week and threatened to trigger a costly
devaluation of the ruble. However, the stock exchange regained
significant ground Tuesday, rising 12 percent to wipe out the
previous day's 10 percent drop. That climb continued Wednesday,
with the market rising more than 5 percent by mid-day. Moreover,
the ruble has been steady in recent days without major support from
Central Bank, which says it has plenty of reserves left to prevent
a run on the currency. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Electronics Co. temporarily
stopped making computer memory chips Wednesday to help ease a
global supply glut and shore up falling chip prices. The move by
Hyundai, South Korea's No. 2 chip maker, was expected to be
followed by Samsung and LG. The three South Korean firms supply 40
percent of the world's memory chips, called Dynamic Random Access
Memory (DRAM) chips. Hyundai said its plant outside Seoul will
remain idle until next Tuesday. The company normally produces 19
million 16-megabit DRAM chips and eight million 64-megabit DRAM
chips a month, or 10 percent of the world supply. Samsung
Electronics Co., the world's No. 1 DRAM chip maker, said it also
was considering cutting production. LG Semicon Co., South Korea's
third largest chip maker, also had cutback plans but refused to
disclose details. South Korean chip makers have suffered sharp
drops in prices that have eroded their earnings. (SKOREA-CHIP
MAKERS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore released figures Wednesday showing a
dramatic increase in layoffs and unemployment during the current
economic slowdown, and predicted harder times ahead. Labor
department officials said there was also less work available, while
the entire job picture worsened ``significantly in the first
quarter of 1998, as impact of the regional economic and currency
crisis sank in.'' The report from the Ministry of Manpower, as the
labor department is officially called, is the latest sign that the
nearly year-old Asian economic turmoil is taking a heavy toll on
this usually prosperous city state. The report said layoffs reached
a record high for any quarterly figure at 7,131, while the number
of job openings dropped to 26,148, 44 percent lower than the same
period last year. The ministry added that demand for new workers is
likely to fall further and unemployment will rise as local
graduates enter the work force in the next few months.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's second-largest commerical
bank plans a second round of capital increases to cope with rising
non-performing loans, the central bank governor said Wednesday.
Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, who is spearheading a shakeup of the Thai
financial sector since taking office a month ago, refused to
provide details on the offering for state-owned Krung Thai Bank.
The Manager, a local business daily, reported Wednesday that the
bank plans to raise 70 billion baht (dlrs 1.7 billion) in new
capital this year to prop up liquidity. The move would mark the
second time Krung Thai Bank has been forced to raise capital since
the Thai financial crisis erupted last July and triggered a chain
reaction of woes across Asia. (THAILAND-ECONOMY)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   SHARI BASURKH, Afghanistan (AP) _ With earthquake survivors in
remote regions still waiting Wednesday for food to arrive,
Afghanistan's deposed president criticized the international
response as too slow. Burhanuddin Rabbani went by helicopter to
Shari-Basurkh _ one of the hardest hit areas _ on Tuesday to see
the devastation caused by Saturday's magnitude-6.9 quake and to
settle a dispute among rebel commanders who control the region. The
northern-based alliance established to stop the Taliban religious
army from consolidating its hold on Afghanistan has been fraught
with internal disputes. Several of them have turned violent. The
feuding comes as residents of the area were trying to dig
themselves from the rubble caused by the deadly quake that killed
as many as 5,000 people, wiped out entire villages and left as many
as 60,000 people homeless. (AFGHANISTAN-EARTHQUAKE)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan ordered new austerity
measures Wednesday, moving fast to protect its fragile economy from
economic sanctions threatened in response to its decision to test
six nuclear devices. In a Cabinet meeting a day earlier, the
government sought to find ways to minimize the impact of sanctions,
most notably from the United States and Japan. The government plans
to cut spending overall by 50 percent, but the details will be
worked out over the next 24 hours, said the independent daily
newspaper, The News. Immediately after Pakistan tested its sixth
nuclear device on Saturday, President Rafiq Tarar used his
constitutional authority to declare a state of emergency and freeze
all foreign currency accounts. (PAKISTAN-ECONOMY)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Striking a conciliatory note after
earlier praising Pakistan's ``Islamic bomb,'' Iran on Wednesday
urged India and Pakistan to talk to reduce tensions created by the
nearly dozen nuclear tests they have conducted. ``We believe in a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region,'' Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi told reporters after meeting with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the Indian capital. India has said
its offer of talks with Pakistan has been on the table for weeks,
but neither country has made a serious effort toward reopening
peace negotiations begun under a previous Indian government.
Kharrazi is the first foreign dignitary to visit the region after
India conducted five tests May 11-13 and Pakistan responded two
weeks later with what it said were six tests. A top Indian foreign
ministry official said India was ready for bilateral talks with
Pakistan but found international concerns about the situation in
South Asia were exaggerated. (INDIA-PAKISTAN)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters shouted ``Hang
Suharto'' outside Parliament and staged a rowdy protest in a main
street on Wednesday, ignoring an appeal by Indonesia's military
chief to halt to ``out of control'' condemnation of the ousted
president. Suharto, a former army general who turns 77 next Monday,
faces growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during
three decades in power. About 2,000 banner-waving students rallied
in a highway outside Parliament, demanding that Suharto be put on
trial for economic crimes. Soldiers closed off the road. The
protesters scoffed at a pledge by new President B.J. Habibie to
hold general elections in 1999, saying he was a corrupt lackey of
Suharto and should step aside. A close ally of Suharto for decades,
the new head of state is bowing to popular demands for democratic
reform. (INDONESIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Threatening a long and devastating strike, Air
France's leading pilots' union was talking tough Wednesday after
the first round of negotiations in a three-day-old walkout already
disrupting some World Cup preparations. The strike at state-owned
Air France _ the World Cup's official carrier _ was a serious
embarrassment to the French government, which also faced walkouts
among Paris transit workers Thursday and national railworkers
strike Friday. Talks were resume at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday,
seven days before the championship begins. No progress was reported
after the first round Tuesday. In the meantime, Air France said its
Wednesday schedule included only 17 percent of its usual
long-distance flights, 30 percent of its short and medium-distance
routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 43 percent from Orly.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ At least 20 people were killed Wednesday
when a high-speed passenger train slammed into an automobile that
had crashed onto the tracks in northeastern Lower Saxony state,
officials said.
	   German television n-tv reported at least 100 injured.
	   The auto that caused the derailment had crashed through the
guardrail of a bridge running over the train tracks, officials
said.
	   The Hamburg-bound train hit the auto at 200 kilometers (125
miles) an hour as it approached the station Eschede, 50 kilometers
(35 miles) north of Hanover. At least 13 cars derailed, crashing
into each other and the base of the bridge, police said.
	   At least two of the rail cars were destroyed, a state spokesman
said. Part of the overpass collapsed onto the train. There was no
immediate word on the driver of the auto.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail cars
and transport them to hospitals.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions.

Precede Abu Dhabi Emirates flies 40 tons of aid to Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with arrival.
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A plane carrying 40 tons of medicine and
medical equipment arrived here Wednesday from the United Arab
Emirates.
	   The aid was ordered by Emirates President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan
Al Nahyan, said Saeed al-Mansouri of the Emirates Red Crescent
Society,
	   ``They (the goods) will be flowing from now on. There will be
more shipments... These are the orders of the president,''
al-Mansouri told reporters.
	   Sheik Zayed is the most vociferous among leaders of the Gulf
Arab states to normalize ties with Baghdad ruptured after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``This present is an expression that the people of the Emirates
want to take part in alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi
children, women and the sick,'' al-Mansouri said.
	   He said another plane carrying an additional 40 tons of aid will
arrive Friday. The goods were collected by the Red Crescent
Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, which has sent
more than 22 million dirhams (dlrs 6 million) worth of aid to Iraq
since 1996.
	   The charity organization has said it plans to open an office in
Baghdad by the end of the year to coordinate the distribution of
humanitarian aid.
	   The Emirates has sent six planes to Iraq in the past six months
carrying food, medicine and clothing, the official Emirates News
Agency said.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its Kuwait invasion.
The sanctions bar it from exporting oil, except for a limited
quantity under U.N. supervision, and also prohibit direct flights
to the country. The United Nations has to approve humanitarian
flights.
	   Arab states have recently increased their shipments of aid to
Iraq, reflecting widespread opposition to the sanctions among their
populations.
	   The U.N. Security Council says the sanctions will not be lifted
until Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi government says at least 1.5 million deaths during the
past seven years have been caused by shortages brought about by the
sanctions. The U.N. Children's Fund says that 960,000 Iraqi
children are suffering from malnutrition.

England goalkeeper Seaman says other players were also drunk 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne wasn't the only drunken England
soccer player the night before coach Glenn Hoddle announced he was
dropping Gascoigne from the World Cup team.
	   England's No. 1 goalkeeper David Seaman said ``quite a few''
other England internationals were also drunk at a team party at
their training base in southern Spain.
	   Hoddle cut the 31-year-old midfielder Sunday because he said he
was out of shape, setting off a controversy about whether one of
England's best midfielders should have made the team.
	   Gascoigne later admitted he was drunk at the party and then said
he was drinking beer during a golf game Sunday just hours before
Hoddle gave him the bad news.
	   ``The party was for everyone to let their hair down _ all the
players, all the staff,'' Seaman said in Wednesday's tabloid Mirror
newspaper.
	   ``Paul, like the rest of us, hadn't had a drink for a week and
he got drunk pretty quickly because of it. But we were all having a
few drinks. It wasn't a wild night, there was no one else in the
bar apart from us.
	   ``Quite a few of the other lads were drunk too, it was not an
issue. He wasn't the worst offender by any means. Paul was pretty
relaxed, pretty calm, the drink just went to his head a bit.''
	   Gascoigne, who became almost a cult figure after leading England
to the semifinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy, has had more
downs that ups since then.
	   He's been frequently injured, lambasted for an erratic personal
life that included hard-drinking with celebrity friends, and was

Four strong quakes rattle central Greece damage or injuries, background

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Four strong earthquakes shook central
Greece on Wednesday, but caused no injuries or damage.
	   The temblors, with preliminary magnitudes between 4.5 and 5.2,
occurred between 11:36 and 11:49 a.m. (0836 and 0849 GMT) with an
epicenter under the sea bed 210 kilometers (131 miles) north of
Athens, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   The quakes were felt in parts of central Greece and the northern
province of Halkidiki, as well as on the Aegean island of Limnos,
the institute said.
	   Seismologists said it was too early to judge whether the four
quakes signaled an increase in the area's seismic activity,
although the 5.2 temblor appeared to be the main quake.
	   The strongest quake in the area, with a magnitude of 7.2,
occurred in 1981.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

Central bank issues silver World Cup coin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's central bank on Wednesday
issued a silver coin with an engraved soccer net to commemorate the
upcoming World Cup.
	   The symbolic sum of lei 100 (dlrs 0.011) with the zeros as
soccer balls, is written inside the net on one side. The Eiffel
Tower and the words ``World Cup France - 1998'' adorn the flip
side, Central Bank official Nicolae Mitea said by telephone.
	   Mitea said each coin weighs 27 grams (0.8 ounces) and has a
retail value of 132,000 lei (dlrs 16).
	   The bank distributed 5,000 coins to bank branches nationwide
Wednesday.
	   ``Their numismatic value will increase in time,'' Mitea said.
	   Romania and England are considered the front-runners in World
Cup Group G, which also includes Colombia and Tunisia.

Two Americans, Canadian named to Northern Ireland police panel 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Two Americans and a Canadian
were appointed Wednesday to an eight-member international
commission which will review policing in Northern Ireland.
	   The commission, headed by former Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patten,
will examine the Royal Ulster Constabulary and seek ways to make it
more broadly representatives of Northern Ireland's Catholic and
Protestant communities.
	   The police force is now more than 90 percent Protestant, and the
international commission was part of the recent agreement on a new
government for Northern Ireland.
	   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, announced these
appointments:
	   _Sir John Smith, former deputy commissioner of London's
Metropolitan Police.
	   _Kathleen O'Toole, secretary for public safety in Boston, Mass.
	   _Peter Smith, an attorney from Northern Ireland.
	   _Maurice Hayes, former senior civil servant in Northern Ireland.
	   _Professor Clifford Shearing, director of the Center of
Criminology at the University of Toronto.
	   _Gerald Lynch, president of John Jay College, New York City.
	   _Lucy Woods, chief executive of British Telecom in Northern
Ireland.

Apartheid death squad commander testifies at former president's trial

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ The apartheid state's most notorious
killer testified Wednesday in former President P.W. Botha's trial
that white-led governments had ordered black activists killed and
denounced his former leaders as ``cowards.''
	   A major problem came home to roost for Botha when former police
Col. Eugene de Kock arrived under guard in an armored personnel
carrier in a police convoy at the courthouse, where the former
president is on trial for refusing to appear before a panel probing
apartheid crimes.
	   The case has turned into an examination of Botha's possible
complicity in state-sanctioned killings and violence when he was
head of state from 1978-1989 and presided over the State Security
Council, which coordinated the crackdown against opponents of white
rule.
	   Standing in the witness dock just 10 feet from Botha, de Kock
was asked by prosecutor Bruce Morrison for his interpretation of
the words ``eliminate'' and ``neutralize,'' used in State Security
Council meetings in reference to how to deal with opponents of
apartheid.
	   ``In the terminology that they used it means killing,'' said de
Kock, peering at the packed courtroom benches through thick-lensed
rectangular spectacles.
	   When Morrison asked de Kock how he felt about serving two life
sentences plus 212 years for murder and other crimes while the
leaders of the apartheid-era governments were free, the decorated
former policeman's voice quivered with anger as he spat out his
response.
	   ``They want to eat lamb but they don't want to see the blood and
the guts,'' said de Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the
nickname Prime Evil. ``They are cowards. They will remain that.''
	   Botha, wearing a grey business suit, looked on impassively.
	   De Kock, a former commander of the Vlakplaas police unit that
assassinated black activists, did not mention the 82-year-old Botha
by name. But the implication was clear.
	   De Kock also recalled receiving the Police Star for Outstanding
Service for bombing the London headquarters of the African National
Congress in 1982. De Kock testified that the medal was normally
only awarded to generals, and that only the head of state _ Botha
at the time _ could authorize it.
	   Aiding the case against Botha could earn de Kock points in his
own amnesty application with the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel which Botha refused to testify before.
	   If Botha, by snubbing the panel, had intended to avoid public
scrutiny of apartheid-era atrocities, it has backfired.
	   Earlier testimony on his trial this week focused on the 1988
bombing of Khotso House, the Johannesburg headquarters of the South
African Council of Churches, which opposed apartheid. A former head
of South Africa's police has testified that Botha ordered the
bombing. De Kock testified that he placed the bombs in the basement
of the building.
	   Asked by Morrison if the government had disapproved of such
actions, de Kock said: ``No they did not. They actually encouraged
it.''
	   Apartheid-era government leaders claim such attacks were the
work of rogue operatives.
	   Early Wednesday, Botha's defense team cross-examined two
witnesses to the Khotso House bombing: security guard Welcome
Ntumba and the former leader of the Methodist Church in South
Africa, the Rev. Peter Storey.
	   Defense attorney Lappe Laubscher, who had opposed the calling of
the witnesses as irrelevant to the charges, declined to ask any
questions.
	   Storey, who lives in Delaware, Ohio, asked the court to pursue
whoever was responsible for the attack.
	   ``I have come a long way to give evidence here and I hope that
there will be clarification about who stands accountable for the
explosion,'' he said. ``It was in my view the most violent act by
the apartheid state against the church of God.''
	   Botha denies he ordered the bombing.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home. He faces up to two years in prison
and unspecified fines if convicted of contempt of the Truth
Commission's subpoenas.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the ANC, which had been waging a guerrilla
campaign against apartheid.
	   The talks culminated in the nation's first all-race elections in
1994, which the ANC won.

Viagra on the black market; officials seek ad ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Newspaper ads in Hungary are illegally
touting Viagra, the much-hyped but unauthorized new impotency pill,
prompting new warnings from Hungarian officials.
	   ``Until someone dies, all we can do is ask that the law on
advertising and regulations on commerce in drugs be enforced,'' Dr.
Tamas Paal, head of the National Pharmaceutical Directorate, was
quoted as saying by the daily Magyar Hirlap on Wednesday.
	   Several newspapers have advertised the pill in violation of the
law, Paal said.
	   A single pill can fetch 2,000 forints (dlrs 10) on the black
market, according to a doctor on a state-run radio call-in show
Wednesday. The average monthly income in Hungary is dlrs 280.
	   Paal said authorization for the commercial sale of any imported
drug takes from six months to up to three years.
	   Dr. Endre Juhasz, a urologist, warned in the daily that before
taking Viagra, the patient must undergo a medical examination as
potency disorders may have a variety of causes.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai affiliate of the U.S.
multi-level marketing firm Amway plans to offer mortgage and
leasing services, the Thai company's general manager was quoted
Wednesday as saying.
	   Amway (Thailand) general manager Preecha Prakobkit said his
company expect to finalize within two months a strategic
partnership with a foreign bank in order to begin providing

representatives and their customers.
	   Amway's sales in Thailand last year totalled 4.8 billion baht
(dlrs 114 million),the newspaper reported.
	   The Michigan-based Amway Corp. reported record worldwide sales
of dlrs 7 billion for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 1997, a 3
percent increase over the year before.
	   The privately-owned company, based in suburban Grand Rapids,
sells more than 400 products _ from soap to vitamins to cosmetics _
through independent dealers around the world.

Kuerten apologizes for throwing racket at umpire AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Kuerten apology
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Defending French Open singles champion Gustavo
Kuerten apologized Wednesday for throwing his racket at an umpire,
saying he hopes the incident ``will make me a more mature guy.''
	   Kuerten, voted by the media last year as the player they liked
best, was disqualified in a doubles match Tuesday night for
throwing his racket at umpire Bruno Rebeuh.
	   The racket hit a fan sitting behind Rebeuh, but the fan
apparently was not hurt.
	   ``I'm so sorry for what happened and I regret what I did,'' the
Brazilian said in a prepared statement. ``I know that this will
make me a more mature guy and will make me grow. I want to make it
clear that I never had the intention of hurting anyone on or off
the court.''
	   The outburst by Kuerten, who faces a fine, evoked memories of a
racket-throwing tantrum that led to John McEnroe being tossed out
of the 1990 Australian Open.
	   Kuerten, who made a storybook run to the men's title last year
as an unseeded player and became a fan favorite at Roland Garros,
was knocked out in singles last week in the second round.
	   He was teamed with fellow Brazilian Fernando Meligeni in a
doubles match against Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman and Australia's
Patrick Rafter on the Suzanne Lenglen Court on Tuesday evening.
	   ``At the end of the first set tiebreaker, he threw his racket
that went just past the chair umpire and went into the stands,
hitting someone in the stands,'' said Stefan Fransson, a Grand Slam
supervisor, who witnessed the incident. ``He threw it from around
the service line.''
	   There had been disputes about line calls during the tiebreaker,
which the Brazilians lost.
	   ``Fernando and I were playing good tennis, even after the
mistakes the chair umpire made,'' Kuerten said. ``I tried to
relieve my tension by throwing the racket in the direction of my
chair. It escaped and went toward the chair umpire. I know I made a
mistake and that the racket's place is in my hand.''
	   Tournament referee Gilbert Ysern said he was unsure whether
Kuerten could be suspended for throwing the racket at Rebeuh, who
was not available for comment after the incident.
	   ``Hopefully, we can give him the benefit of the doubt and think
that he didn't really aim at killing the chair umpire by throwing
the racket at him,'' Ysern said.
	   Ysern said the fan hit by the racket apparently was not hurt.
Witnesses said the fan was hit in the shoulder.
	   ``He lost his mind a little bit,'' Ysern said. ``The chair
umpire could have been hit, maybe hurt by the racket. It's
obviously a serious situation. It's a serious case.''
	   At the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was disqualified for
throwing a racket, an incident that led to $6,500 in fines. McEnroe
only threw his racket to the court, however.
	   At Wimbledon in 1995, Rebeuh also was involved when American
Jeff Tarango stormed off court in the middle of a match. He accused
Rebeuh of favoritism, and Tarango's wife slapped Rebeuh.
	   That incident resulted in a fine and a one-year suspension from
Wimbledon for Tarango.
	   Germany's Carsten Arriens was defaulted from the 1995 French
Open when he threw his racket on the ground and it bounced up and
hit a line judge.
	   Benjamin Deshayes, an usher at Tuesday's doubles match, said the
incident happened moments after the end of the tiebreaker.
	   ``Kuerten threw his racket at the umpire, but the umpire ducked
and the racket went into the audience,'' Deshayes said. ``Kuerten
got the racket back from the audience and threw it on the ground.''

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea charged that Ethiopian troops
used tanks and heavy artillery to attack Eritrean positions in
southern Ambesete Geleba early Wednesday.
	   Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Andemicael Kahsai said no
details were immediately available on casualties in the village 140
kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The ministry called the attack ``a new and dangerous
escalation'' of the border crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia and
said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on Eritrean
positions.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian government persists in its
intransigent position of launching a full-scale war unless Eritrea
withdraws unconditionally from territories that are indisputable
Eritrean,'' the ministry said in a statement.
	   The Ethiopian government had no immediate comment.
	   On May 13, Ethiopia first made public the border dispute,
calling on Eritrea to withdraw from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea has consistently denied it has moved into Ethiopia and
on Wednesday repeated a call for a total demilitarization of border
areas and outside mediation to solve the dispute.
	   Andemicael called the Ethiopian demand that Eritrean troops
withdraw from disputed territory ``a stumbling block to any
progress.''

	   Al-NIBAI, Iraq (AP) _ United Nations weapons inspectors searched
through reeds and sand dunes Wednesday for missing missile parts in
a bid to verify Iraq's claims that it has buried all its biological
and chemical missile warheads.
	   Wearing protective suits, masks, boots and gloves, some 27
experts, under German Jean Jano, used metal detectors and other
equipment in their search at Al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
north of Baghdad.
	   Others supervised an earth-moving machine as it uncovered the
nose cone of a missile warhead. ``This belongs to a conventional
warhead,'' shouted an Iraqi engineer.
	   In 1991, Iraq chose to destroy a great number of its long-range
missiles and bury them rather than declare them to U.N inspectors.
	   ``We hope that this work will help to settle some of the still
outstanding issues concerning the missile warheads,'' Jano, 61,
told The Associated Press.
	   The area where Iraq unilaterally buried its missiles is vast.
Experts with magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors placed small,
red flags on the ground to determine where the next digging should
be.
	   ``We've with us some of the latest state-of-the-art high-tech
equipment,'' said Vincent Murphy, a 69-year-old geophysicist from
Boston. ``It is all digitally recorded. The data is brought back in
the recorder to one of the vehicles and downloaded to the laptop.''
	   The advanced equipment is needed because no aerial photography
or satellite images will penetrate the type of soil at al-Nibai, he
said.
	   Jano, an aerodynamics expert, said inspectors have found ``for
instance, aluminum canisters that are used for chemical agents and
some stainless steel canisters... used for biological agents.''
	   But he refused to say how many missiles and warheads were buried
in Al-Nabai nor would he divulge whether what they have collected
so far is sufficient to verify Iraqi claims that all its long-range
missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons have been
destroyed _ the main condition for the U.N. Security Council to end
the crippling sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   The current excavation is scheduled to end June 18.
	   Jano said another team of experts will arrive in Baghdad soon to
analyze the findings, now stored at Taji, a military camp 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Accounting for special warheads is one of the main hurdles in
Iraq's efforts to declare itself clean of prohibited missiles with
ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Senior Iraqi officers looked on as the experts searched. The
Iraqis refuse to wear safety gear, saying there is nothing toxic
about the pieces of scrap underground.
	   U.N. monitors' suits are burned every day, and inspectors must
wash their hands and feet in a bleach solution before leaving the
site.
	   Jano said he hoped to do all that is required by the end of his
mission in the light of ``excellent cooperation'' he has received
from the Iraqi side.
	   At the United Nations, Iraqi officials tried Tuesday to convince
the Security Council that Baghdad had met the terms for ending
economic sanctions by destroying all illegal weapons. U.S. and
British diplomats said they remained unconvinced.

Portuguese Premier to ask Britain's Blair for help on East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres was to
travel to London on Wednesday in search of British Prime Minister
Tony Blair's help in resolving the dispute between Lisbon and
Jakarta over East Timor.
	   The resignation of Indonesian President Suharto last month
triggered a Portuguese diplomatic push to persuade foreign leaders
to pressure Jakarta into softening its stance on the disputed
territory.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a few months after the
departure of Portugal's colonial administration, annexing the
half-island the following year.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule in East
Timor and has been brokering negotiations between Lisbon and
Jakarta.
	   Guterres will ask Blair to lobby Jakarta for the release of East
Timorese political prisoners held in Indonesian jails, a government
spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Portuguese prime minister is specifically campaigning for
the release of Xanana Gusmao, the jailed leader of the armed
separatist movement inside East Timor, the spokesman said.
	   A phone call from Guterres last month prompted Blair to send his
deputy foreign minister, Derek Fatchett to Jakarta to visit Gusmao
in prison and publicly urge his release.
	   Lisbon wants a referendum to be held in the territory, but
Jakarta has repeatedly ruled out such a move.
	   Indonesia's new president B.J. Habibie said in a CNN interview
broadcast Wednesday that East Timor must remain an integral part of
Indonesia.

At least 20 dead in high-speed German train crash train, previous crashes

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ At least 20 people were killed Wednesday
when a high-speed passenger train slammed into an automobile that
had plunged off a bridge onto tracks in northeastern Lower Saxony
state, officials said.
	   State officials said at least 200 people were injured.
	   The auto had crashed through the guardrail of a bridge running
over the train tracks, officials said.
	   The Hamburg-bound train struck the auto at 200 kilometers (125
miles) an hour as it approached the station in Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover. At least 13 cars derailed,
crashing into each other and the base of the bridge, police said.
	   At least two of the rail cars were destroyed, a state spokesman
said. Part of the overpass collapsed onto the train. There was no
immediate information on the driver of the auto.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions.
	   It was the worst train collision in Germany since 1975 when 41
people were killed in the head-on collision of two express trains
in Bavaria.
	   The high-speed ICE train, which went into full service in 1991,
is Germany's fastest train, connecting all major cities at speeds
up to 280 kilometers an hour (175 miles an hour).
	   Federal Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann and German railway
executives were en route to the scene.

Sudanese rebels capture strategic garrison town

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels captured the garrison town
of Ulu, on the road to a dam that provides most of Khartoum's
electricity, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The rebels defeated two government brigades in a daylong battle
Tuesday for Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of the
capital, said George Garang, spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   At least 72 government troops were killed, he said. No figures
on rebel casualties were provided.
	   In Khartoum, the military forces issued a communique Tuesday
night saying that ``fierce battles are currently going on in Ulu
area.'' It made no comment on the battle Wednesday.
	   The pro-government newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam said, however,
President Omar el-Bashir ``declared general mobilization in all
parts of the Sudan and called on all sectors to move to the
military training camps, and then from there to the operation
zones.''
	   El-Bashir was quoted by the daily Al-Gomhuriya as saying the
rebels had recently received ``additional assistance from the
enemies of the homeland,'' but he did not specify from whom.
	   Ulu is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of Damazin
and the Roseires dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's
electricity. The dam is about 500 kilometers (315 miles) southeast
of Khartoum.
	   In Cairo, SPLA representative Daniel Kodi Angelo said the
rebels' next target was a government oil exploration operation at
Khor Adar, 52 miles (83 kilometers) west of Ulu.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Africa needs reconstruction -- not new wars,
Pope John Paul II said Wednesday, expressing worry about rising
tensions between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   He called for prayers so that leaders ``have the courage to
renounce the recourse to arms and that the patience of dialogue''
prevails.
	   John Paul made a special African appeal, particularly regarding
a simmering border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, during his

Eds: UPDATES with Albanian reports say several villages wiped out

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ A major Serb assault on ethnic Albanian
villages in Kosovo drove a new wave of refugees into Albania and
sent thousands more seeking the safety of border highlands, reports
said Wednesday.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
2,000 refugees had crossed overnight into Albania. The spokesman,
Kris Janowski, said that a total of 3,700 Kosovo Albanians had fled
to Albania since the Serb assault was launched late last week.
	   Most are women, children and elderly who are ``exhausted
mentally and physically,'' Janowski said in Geneva. The refugee
agency assumes many more are hiding in the rugged, hilly border
terrain, and ``we reckon with many more people crossing over,''
Janowski said.
	   Albania's state-run ATA news agency said about 3,000 more
refugees were approaching the border.
	   It cited an unidentified refugee as saying as many as 50,000
more were on the Kosovo side of the hills separating the Serbian
province from Albania. They were also walking toward the border,
said the report, which could not be independently confirmed.
	   Local authorities in northeastern Albania, site of most of the
crossings, said that with more refugees arriving by the hour, the
25 tons of aid sent Tuesday by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees was inadequate.
	   Janowski said that shelling in the border region appeared to
have died down. But the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
ethnic Albanian leadership, spoke of heavy shelling Wednesday
morning in the Decani region west of Pristina. It said some
villages had been wiped out by air and rocket attacks.
	   The center said that makeshift medical care was unable to deal
with the many wounded civilians in the region. Up to 10,000
villagers may be in nearby woods regions, cut off by Serb forces.
	   In another unconfirmed report documenting growing reluctance to
die for Kosovo, the daily Telegraf, published in Belgrade, reported
that about 100 policemen had been fired for refusing to go fight in
the province.
	   The refugee influx first began growing late last week as Serb
police and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army stepped up their
campaign to crush the pro-separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers after
years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the
secessionist southern province, where ethnic Albanians represent 90
percent of the population of 2.2 million.
	   Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees fleeing
to neighboring Albania described artillery bombardments that forced
out entire villages and house-burnings they said were clearly
intended to drive them out.
	   There have been no reports like those in Bosnia of massive
civilian roundups or massacres in the Kosovo campaign, which the
Serbs insist targets guerrillas.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted increasing comparisons to the
ethnic war in Bosnia and its atrocities. More than 200 people have
been killed in the province in the past three months.
	   The growing violence has sparked alarm among Western powers that
the fighting could spill over into neighboring Balkan nations.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton told a visiting delegation of ethnic
Albanians in Washington last week that the United States ``shall
not tolerate another Bosnia in Kosovo.''
	   But the West repeatedly has failed to get Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo, and has
yet to devise a strategy for how to resolve the worsening conflict.
	   Those concerns prompted NATO last week to consider possible
troop deployments in Albania and Macedonia. But Russia said Tuesday
that NATO cannot post troops in Albania without the approval of the
United Nations.
	   Based on information from the refugees and ethnic Albanian
officials in Kosovo, the latest campaign is concentrated in the
western region of Decani, where the Serbs deployed thousands of
additional paramilitary forces and are pulverizing 10 towns and
villages with artillery.

Vatican's secretary of state meets Ukrainian president

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, met Wednesday with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
and noted the warm welcome extended to him in the former Soviet
republic.
	   Relations between Ukraine and the Vatican have been troubled by
the country's church rift and the government's reluctance to invite
Pope John Paul II for a long-awaited visit.
	   The subject was expected to come up during Sodano's five-day
visit. The cardinal, who held a service at Kiev's main Roman
Catholic church Tuesday, also was due to meet with premier Valery
Pustovoitenko and other officials and to inaugurate a new Apostolic
Nunciature office.
	   Meeting with Kuchma at the presidential headquarters, Sodano
said he was pleased by the ``especially warm welcome'' he saw in
Ukraine. Kuchma, in turn, said he was deeply impressed by his
meetings with the pope in the Vatican and in Poland last summer.
	   Last year, in a bid to demonstrate Ukraine's stability to the
West, the president brought leaders of 15 Christian groups in
Ukraine to sign a peace memorandum, but it appeared to do little to
ease the religious tensions.
	   Ukraine, with an estimated 35 million believers, has seen major
sectarian struggles since the Soviet collapse. The country is
mostly Orthodox Christian but has a large Greek Catholic minority
that dominates western regions.
	   Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine has been torn by a conflict
between the Moscow-run Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which controlled
Ukrainian believers during the Soviet era, and a Kiev-based
Orthodox church.
	   Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II has declined to meet with
the pope over the struggle in western Ukraine.
	   Complicating relations with the Vatican, the Moscow-based church
also has refused to return property it acquired when the Soviets
shut down Eastern Rite Catholic churches in Ukraine. Those churches
follow Orthodox rituals, but are loyal to Rome.
	   The Vatican long has urged reconciliation between Catholics and
Orthodox Christians in the former Soviet Union.
	   During his Ukrainian visit, Sodano also is scheduled to travel
to the western city of Lviv, where he will meet with Greek Catholic
and Latin Rite communities.

In unpredictable French Open, at least Hingis still on course 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Corretja advancing to semifinals

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The predictable almost never happens at the French
Open. So it shouldn't be a surprise that Marcelo Rios, the
consensus favorite on the men's side, was ousted in the
quarterfinals.
	   But at least one predictable phenomenon remains on course: the
onward march of Martina Hingis, the world's undisputed best woman
player.
	   Hingis defeated Venus Williams on Tuesday with such ease that it
put to rest any talk of a great rivalry _ at least for now.
	   Hingis next faces a newly inspired Monica Seles, a three-time
champion here, in one of Thursday's semifinals. No. 2 seed Lindsay
Davenport plays two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
other.
	   On the men's side, Rios, the No. 3 seed from Chile, blew his
chance to overtake Pete Sampras as the world's No. 1 player when he
lost 6-1, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to Carlos Moya.
	   Rios held that spot for a month earlier this year, and could
have reclaimed it with a quarterfinal victory.
	   On Wednesday, 14th-seeded Alex Corretja defeated Filip Dewulf
7-5, 6-4, 6-3 to reach his first Grand Slam semifinal. He became
the third Spaniard to reach the men's semifinals, joining Moya and
Felix Mantilla.
	   The fourth semifinalist was to be determined later Wednesday,
with France's Cedric Pioline facing Hicham Arazi of Morocco.
	   With Davenport and Seles advancing, there are two American women
in the French Open semifinals for the first time since Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert reached the final four in 1987. But
there were none of the hoped-for echoes of Evert and Navratilova
when Hingis and Williams took the court for their much anticipated
match.
	   In a swirling wind that hampered both players, Hingis used her
deft touch and uncanny court sense to dictate play throughout.
	   Never in the 6-3, 6-4 victory did the Swiss star appear out of
control, off balance or rushed.
	   Williams, for her part, hurt herself with 38 unforced errors.
	   ``I don't think I was as patient as I should have been. I guess
everyone knows I like to hit,'' Williams said. ``I suppose I got a
little too excited, really wanted to hit a winner.''
	   Hingis came into the match with a 5-2 career record against the
eighth-seeded Williams, but the two 17-year-olds were 2-2 this
year.
	   The match promised to be an intriguing battle between power and
smarts. Despite her far greater experience, Hingis actually is 3{
months younger than Williams.
	   But, just as in their only previous Grand Slam tournament
encounter _ a 6-0, 6-4 win by Hingis in the U.S. Open final last
summer _ the match turned into a one-sided affair.
	   ``It's probably good for me to lose so I can really see what I'm
doing wrong and really look at myself and say, `Venus, you're not
there,''' she said.
	   Moya, seeded 12th here, is ranked 12th in the world, but has
been as high as fifth. He's hoping to crack back into the top 10
this week.
	   He became the talk of the tennis world at last year's Australian
Open _ for both his dashing good looks and his talent. He upset
defending champion Boris Becker in the first round, then went
straight through to the final, where he lost to Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old Moya had never
gone past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And here at
Roland Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two
previous visits.
	   Moya was at the top of his all-court game Tuesday.
	   A crucial moment came in the fourth set at 4-4, 15-15, Rios
serving. Moya, leading two sets to one, hit a shot and Rios let it
go, thinking the ball had bounced twice on Moya's side. But the
referee said it hadn't.
	   Rios lost the point, the game and his concentration.
	   ``Maybe if I won that game, the match would have been
different,'' he said.
	   Now Moya, who faces Mantilla in Friday's semifinals, is the
highest seed left in the tournament. Mantilla and Moya are buddies.
	   ``We're going to be friends until Friday,'' he said. ``When we
get to the court, I will try to kill him.''
	   The day's action ended on a sour note when Gustavo Kuerten, the
defending champion who lost in the second round, was disqualified
in doubles for throwing his racket at the chair umpire and hitting
a fan in the stands, but apparently not causing injury.
	   ``I'm so sorry for what happened and I regret what I did,'' the
Brazilian said Wednesday in a prepared statement. ``I know that
this will make me a more mature guy and will make me grow. I want
to make it clear that I never had the intention of hurting anyone
on or off the court.''
	   Kuerten, who won last year as an unseeded player, is well liked
by fans, players and the media. In fact, he won this year's Orange
Prize, voted by French tennis writers for the player they like
best.
	   There's also a Lemon Prize, for the player they like least. The
winner, two years running, has been Rios.

Report: Bishop burns ``heretical'' books by leading theologians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian Orthodox bishop ordered a school to
publicly burn ``heretical'' writings by leading Orthodox
theologians _ an act highlighting the church's deep internal
divisions, the Moscow Times said Wednesday.
	   The books by the priests _ Alexander Schmemann, John Meyendorf
and Alexander Menn _ were confiscated from students in a religious
school and burned before their eyes last month on the orders of
Bishop Nikon of Yekaterinburg, the Times and other reports said.
	   Nikon, the top church official in the Ural Mountains region
1,500 kilometers (900 miles) from Moscow, also has reportedly
ordered a dissident priest defrocked for refusing ``to help
dethrone dangerous and heretical delusions,'' the newspaper said.
	   Nikon and the church leadership have denied burning the books,
but several church officials confirmed the incident privately, the
Times said. One local church member sent a complaint to the Russian
Orthodox Church's Patriarchate in Moscow.
	   The conflict is the latest sign of an ongoing battle between the
church's conservative and moderate wings. Conservatives who hold
key posts in the hierarchy oppose ecumenism and have resisted
contacts with most Western churches, including some branches of
Orthodoxy.
	   While some consider Menn's writings controversial, Schmemann and
Meyendorf are generally praised as the church's most important 20th
century theologians. The two served as consecutive deans of St.
Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in New York.
	   Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II has frequently expressed his
admiration for Schmemann and Meyendorf, whose books are studied in
many ecclesiastical schools across Russia.
	   ``Now to hear that a bishop of the church, now living in
freedom, is capable of an act so repugnant and godless fills me
with dismay and anger,'' Serge Schmemann, the late theologian's son
and a Pulitzer Prize winning U.S. journalist, told the paper.
	   Schmemann's widow, Juliana, has sent a letter to Alexy asking
him to clarify the situation, the Times said.

APEC ministers, industry to boost electronic commerce 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Asia-Communications
By LAURINDA KEYS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite the economic crisis, Asia-Pacific
nations are committed to boosting electronic commerce through
common laws that encourage consumer use, according to a draft
document prepared for Wednesday's meeting of telecommunications and
information ministers.
	   At the first dialogue session with industry leaders at an
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, service providers urged
that costs be limited, while government delegates said consumers
need to be protected.
	   ``APEC has a unique opportunity to promote electronic commerce
for businesses and consumers,'' said the draft of ``The Singapore
Delegation,'' which is expected to be adopted by the ministers when
their meeting ends Friday.
	   The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, favored ``efforts
to harmonize the region's electronic commerce policies, legal and
regulatory practices.''
	   It also proposed more electronic delivery of government
services, and enhancement of infrastructure, services and
applications of particular interest to the diverse peoples of the
Asia-Pacific countries.
	   The World Trade Organization estimates that electronic business
will grow from dlrs 7 billion this year to dlrs 300 billion, or 1
percent of the global economy, by 2002, said Glenn Falcao,
president of internet service provision for Canada's Nortel, Inc.
	   Electronic commerce ``shrinks time and business barriers,'' he
said.
	   In the opening address of the dialogue session, Terry Chang,
president and founder of Taiwan's Bookline on-line bookstore, said
electronic customers want ``abundant, accurate information geared
to their individual needs ... at the lowest prices ever.''
	   They also want security for the credit cards they use in
electronic purchases, privacy for their personal details, and fast
delivery of their products.
	   Chang urged governments to recognize that high
telecommunications and postal charges, and generous customer
protection laws, are hard on electronic businesses.
	   ``Regulated by governments, the cost of lease lines today is
still too high for any large scale electronic commerce business,''
Chang said.
	   But Australia's communications minister, Sen. Richard Alston,
responded that commercial risks must be taken by the private
sector.
	   ``The role of government is confined to building confidence
through laws making sure people's personal details are not provided
without their consent and they are aware of what they're doing,''
Alston said.
	   New Zealand's communications minister, Maurice Williamson,
wondered whether governments can control electronic commerce or
help it develop.
	   ``We're going into a knowledge-based society where government
control will be nowhere what we are used to with our citizens,'' he
said.

U.S. ambassador: announcement on U.S. peace initiative in days 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The United States expects Israel to
reach a decision on a West Bank troop withdrawal within days, not
weeks, as suggested by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel said Wednesday.
	   Ambassador Edward Walker said that while the United States has
not given Israel a deadline to accept a U.S. proposal for a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, ``there is a very
short time frame.''
	   Netanyahu told lawmakers Tuesday that he expected to have made a
decision on an Israeli troop pullback by the end of July, before
parliament goes into summer recess, according to legislator Yehuda
Harel of the centrist Third Way party.
	   However, far-right coalition partners have warned Netanyahu that
they would bring down his government over a 13 percent troop
pullback, and Netanyahu is reluctant to accept the U.S. plan.
	   Walker said Wednesday that the United States will soon make a
decision on whether to pursue its peace iniative. If a failure is
announced, Israel would bear the brunt of the blame because the
Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan.
	   ``It (the decision) is in a matter of days rather than weeks,
but precisely what day and what hour and so on I have no idea
exactly. It depends how the progress goes,'' Walker said.
	   Last month, Israel already ignored one U.S. deadline, and
Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Wednesday
that Washington displayed ``a lack of will to stand firm in the
face of Israel's intransigence.''
	   On Tuesday, U.S. envoy Thomas Pickering asked Jordanian and
Saudi Arabian leaders to delay plans for an Arab summit for another
week to allow the American initiative to play itself out.
	   The Palestinians are pushing for an Arab summit that would
conclude with an announcement that the Arab world is suspending the
normalization of ties with Israel as long as Netanyahu does not
carry out the peace agreement already signed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat traveled to Oman on Wednesday
to lobby for support among Gulf State leaders to convene an Arab
summit. Palestinians have said that they will push for the summit
even if Israel does accept the U.S. proposals.
	   In London, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met Wednesday with two
top Palestinian officials to discuss the troop withdrawal.
According to Maariv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon declined an invitation to
attend the meeting because the government has not yet decided on
the scope of a troop pullback.

Sudanese rebels capture strategic garrison town 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels captured the garrison town
of Ulu, on the road to a dam that provides most of Khartoum's
electricity, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The rebels defeated two government brigades in a daylong battle
Tuesday for Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of the
capital, said George Garang, spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army in Nairobi.
	   At least 72 government troops were killed, he said. No figures
on rebel casualties were provided.
	   In Khartoum, the military forces issued a communique Tuesday
night saying that ``fierce battles are currently going on in Ulu
area.'' It made no comment on the battle Wednesday.
	   The pro-government newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam said, however,
President Omar el-Bashir ``declared general mobilization in all
parts of the Sudan and called on all sectors to move to the
military training camps, and then from there to the operation
zones.''
	   El-Bashir was quoted by the daily Al-Gomhuriya as saying the
rebels recently received ``additional assistance from the enemies
of the homeland,'' but he did not specify from whom.
	   Ulu is 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of the city of Damazin
and the Roseires dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's
electricity. The dam is about 500 kilometers (315 miles) southeast
of Khartoum.
	   In Cairo, SPLA representative Daniel Kodi Angelo said the
rebels' next target was a government oil exploration operation at
Khor Adar, 52 miles (83 kilometers) west of Ulu.
	   The SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

Russian tax police seize coal company assets to pay back wages 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian tax police seized assets from a coal
mining company, including food and hidden bank accounts, and began
distributing them to unpaid workers, a news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The action by the federal tax police was among the boldest
attempts by the government to force mining companies to pay their
workers, and suggested a heightened sense of urgency about solving
the wage-arrears crisis.
	   A nationwide miners' strike aimed at forcing the payment of back
wages was one of the factors leading to last week's crash of
Russian markets. The crash has threatened the financial stability
of the country.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, a tax police task force in the southern
city of Rostov-on-Don transferred nearly 27 million rubles (dlrs
4.5 million) to unpaid workers of the Rostovugol coal company after
seizing some of its assets.
	   These included cafes, canteens, cars and two secret bank
accounts containing nearly 3 million rubles (dlrs 500,000), the
news agency said. Workers were paid both in cash and in food and
other goods.
	   Several company executives, including the former director
general, were charged with crimes uncovered in the investigation,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The news agency also reported that the federal government was
continuing to pour money into mines throughout the coal-rich
Kuzbass region to repay workers, some of whom have not been paid in
six months. Many of the mines have nominally been privatized, but
the state usually remains the largest shareholder.
	   Miners have carried out dozens of scattered strikes over the
past couple of years to demand back wages, but last month's strike
was larger than most. The miners grabbed the government's attention
by blockading railroad lines, crippling the rail system that is
Russia's economic circulatory system.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea charged that Ethiopian troops
used tanks and heavy artillery to attack Eritrean positions in
southern Ambesete Geleba early Wednesday.
	   Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Andemicael Kahsai said no
details were immediately available on casualties in the village 140
kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The ministry called the attack ``a new and dangerous
escalation'' of the border crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia and
said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on Eritrean
positions.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Ethiopian government persists in its
intransigent position of launching a full-scale war unless Eritrea
withdraws unconditionally from territories that are indisputable
Eritrean,'' the ministry said in a statement.
	   The Ethiopian government had no immediate comment on the
Eritreans' charge of an attack.
	   State-run radio accused Eritrea of publicly executing three
Ethiopian civilians whom it said Eritrea had abducted during a
cross-border raid.
	   Another 30 civilians were in the custody of the Eritrean army
and their fate was unknown, said Kiros Bitow, chairman of
Ethiopia's Tigray western zone administration.
	   Kiros said about 24,677 Ethiopians had been displaced in the
Badme and Sheraro areas following Eritrean invasions.
	   The British government on Tuesday advised its citizens in
Eritrea not to travel outside the capital, and urged them to ``give
careful consideration to leaving Eritrea while scheduled flights
are available.''
	   On May 13, Ethiopia first made public the border dispute,
calling on Eritrea to withdraw from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea has consistently denied it has moved into Ethiopia and
on Wednesday repeated a call for a total demilitarization of border
areas and outside mediation to solve the dispute.
	   Andemicael called the Ethiopian demand that Eritrean troops
withdraw from disputed territory ``a stumbling block to any
progress.''

Husband of Brazilian woman arrested in child kidnapping case 
</HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Police have arrested a Lebanese man who
is wanted in Brazil for forging his Brazilian wife's signature and
kidnapping their sons, the prosecutor general said Wednesday.
	   Police are now trying to confirm whether Atef Abbas, 38, forged
the signature of his estranged wife, Vagna Bandeira, on a permit to
take their two boys out of Brazil, Prosecutor General Adnan Addoum
said.
	   Bandeira followed them to Lebanon on May 9 after contacts with
Lebanese authorities failed to give her custody of the boys, Hamze,
4, and Bilal, 2. She has been on a hunger strike here since May 20.
	   ``If the investigations show that Abbas forged his wife's
signature, he will be prosecuted here,'' Addoum told The Associated
Press.
	   Bandeira and her husband separated in April 1997 in Brazil. The
boys lived with their mother until June when Abbas brought them to
Lebanon.
	   Bandeira, 35, has visited her sons here on several occasions in
the presence of her husband. The children had been staying with
their father in the eastern town of Chtoura until his arrest
Tuesday.
	   Abbas has denied the Brazilian charges of kidnapping and forging
Bandeira's signature on a document that purportedly gave him
permission to take the boys out of the country.
	   Lebanon and Brazil have no extradition treaty, and Bandeira's
Lebanese lawyer has filed a suit against Abbas in a bid to have him
tried in Lebanon. The lawyer was provided by the Brazilian Embassy
in Beirut where Bandeira has been staying.
	   She has said she would rather die than have her children think
she abandoned them. She drinks only water and refuses food.
	   An official at the embassy told the AP Wednesday that Bandeira,
looking wan and pale, was allowed to see her children at the
Justice Ministry Tuesday for a short while before they were
returned to Chtoura to their grandmother's home.
	   He added that a deal to get Abbas to return to Brazil along with
his wife and children fell apart after Abbas' mother allegedly tore
up her son's and grandsons' passports in a bid to keep them in
Lebanon.
	   The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   But newspaper reports Wednesday said Abbas reneged on the deal
to return to Brazil, fearing prosecution.
	   ``I will not go to Brazil and I will face my fate in my
country,'' As-Safir daily quoted him as saying.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Four strong earthquakes shook central
Greece on Wednesday, but caused no injuries or damage.
	   The temblors, with preliminary magnitudes between 4.5 and 5.2,
occurred between 11:36 and 11:49 a.m. (0836 and 0849 GMT) with an
epicenter under the sea bed 210 kilometers (130 miles) north of
Athens, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   The quakes were felt in parts of central Greece and the northern
province of Halkidiki, as well as on the Aegean island of Limnos,
the institute said.
	   Seismologists said it was too early to judge whether the four
quakes signaled an increase in the area's seismic activity,
although the 5.2 temblor appeared to be the main quake.
	   The strongest quake in the area, with a magnitude of 7.2,
occurred in 1981.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ The apartheid state's most notorious
killer testified Wednesday in former President P.W. Botha's trial
that white-led governments had ordered black activists killed and
denounced his former leaders as ``cowards.''
	   A major problem came home to roost for Botha when former police
Col. Eugene de Kock arrived under guard in an armored personnel
carrier in a police convoy at the courthouse, where the former
president is on trial for refusing to appear before a panel probing
apartheid crimes.
	   The case has turned into an examination of Botha's possible
complicity in state-sanctioned killings and violence when he was
head of state from 1978-1989 and presided over the State Security
Council, which coordinated the crackdown against opponents of white
rule.
	   Standing in the witness dock just 10 feet from Botha, de Kock
was asked by prosecutor Bruce Morrison for his interpretation of
the words ``eliminate'' and ``neutralize,'' used in State Security
Council meetings in reference to how to deal with opponents of
apartheid.
	   ``In the terminology that they used it means killing,'' said de
Kock, peering at the packed courtroom through thick-lensed
rectangular spectacles.
	   When Morrison asked de Kock how he felt about serving two life
sentences plus 212 years for murder and other crimes while the
leaders of the apartheid-era governments were free, the decorated
former policeman's voice quivered with anger as he spat out his
response.
	   ``They want to eat lamb but they don't want to see the blood and
the guts,'' said de Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the
nickname Prime Evil. ``They are cowards. They will remain that.''
	   Botha, wearing a grey business suit, looked on impassively.
	   De Kock, a former commander of the Vlakplaas police unit that
assassinated black activists, did not mention the 82-year-old Botha
by name. But the implication was clear.
	   De Kock also recalled receiving the Police Star for Outstanding
Service for bombing the London headquarters of the African National
Congress in 1982. De Kock testified that the medal was normally
only awarded to generals, and that only the head of state _ Botha
at the time _ could authorize it.
	   Aiding the case against Botha could earn de Kock points in his
own amnesty application with the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel which Botha refused to testify before.
	   Truth Commission Chairman Desmond Tutu, went to the witness
stand after de Kock, and said it pained him to be there. The former
Anglican archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner had urged Botha to
apply for amnesty with the Truth Commission for abuses committed
under apartheid. Botha refused, saying he had nothing to apologize
for.
	   ``I stand here with the greatest possible reluctance and filled
with considerable distaste,'' Tutu said.

Scottish Premier League secures lucrative TV deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The new Scottish Premier League Wednesday secured
a record-breaking 45 million pound (dlrs 73.35 million) contract
with Sky Sports to broadcast 30 live matches a year starting in
August.
	   The deal is the latest for the Australian-born media magnate
Rupert Murdoch, who owns Sky.
	   The four-year deal will feature coverage at prime time on Sunday
following Sky's coverage of England's Premier League and first
division.
	   Scottish Premier League acting chief executive Robert Wilson
said each of the 10 clubs would be visited at least once during the
year.
	   The new league broke away after last season from the old
Scottish 10-team Premier Division.
	   Rangers chairman David Murray said Sky coverage had helped
improve the England's Premier League and said it would do the same
in Scotland.
	   ``We believe this deal is the best possible for Scottish
football,'' said Aberdeen executive chairman Stewart Milne.

Chinese president says China won't resume nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China does not plan to resume nuclear testing
despite fears of an arms race between neighboring India and
Pakistan, President Jiang Zemin said Wednesday.
	   Jiang reaffirmed China's commitment to a global testing ban,
even though India and Pakistan's rival nuclear tests have
challenged international efforts to stop the spread of nuclear
weapons.
	   ``China has nuclear weapons, but has undertaken to not use its
nuclear weapons first. It advocates a thorough ban and destruction
of nuclear weapons and it has no intention of resuming nuclear
testing,'' China Central Television quoted Jiang as saying in a
meeting with Jean Miot, chairman of Agence France-Presse.
	   As one of the world's five declared nuclear powers before
India's tests last month, China is a crucial supporter of both the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Non-proliferation Treaty.
Neither India nor Pakistan has signed them.
	   China's security concerns in South Asia have raised questions
about whether Beijing would remain committed to the moratorium on
nuclear tests it declared in 1996.
	   A senior Foreign Ministry official reminded reporters Monday
that China has the right to resume testing under the test ban
treaty if its national security is threatened, but said it had no
intention to test now.
	   Three wars have been fought on China's southwestern border, two
between Pakistan and India and one between China and India.
Although China is closely allied with Pakistan, it also has worked
to improve relations with India.
	   Jiang also reasserted Beijing's denial of allegations that it
helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons, according to a transcript
of the interview provided by AFP.
	   ``China has not helped Pakistan,'' he said. ``The nuclear
cooperation between China and Pakistan is strictly peaceful in the
area of technology for nuclear reactors, and all the installations
concerned are under the control of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.''

<TEXT>
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The commander of the United Nations
monitoring force in Angola says the country might be sliding back
into civil war.
	   Maj. Gen. Phillip Sibanda, the Zimbabwean commander of
U.N.forces in Angola, made the assessment Tuesday while home on
furlough. He said the situation remained ``pretty volatile''
despite U.N. attempts to implement the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol.
	   ``Hostilities were likely to resume any time and both sides
remained skeptical of each other's intention,'' he was quoted as
saying by Zimbabwe's national news agency ZIANA.
	   Last week, U.N. special envoy to Angola Alioun Blondin Beye
declared that his efforts were fruitless and that he was ready to
give up.
	   ``If he decides to resign because he sees no hope, then you
could say we are headed for serious problems,'' Sibanda said.
	   Both the former UNITA rebel group and the government contain
those who favor ``a military solution'' to their problems, Sibanda
was quoted as saying.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The unemployment insurance fund
could run dry next year if the demand on it continues to increase,
according to the unemployment insurance commissioner.
	   ``If things get worse we might go to Cabinet to ask for
rescue,'' Shadrack Mkhonto said Tuesday, after the fund's 1997
report showed a deficit of 254 million rand (dlrs 49 million).
	   Mkhonto said he did not believe the fund would last even to
2000.
	   The deficit was caused mainly by the general increase in
unemployment.
	   Joblessness figures for 1997 had been up 71,000 on 1996, and in
the first
	   half of this year alone the formal sector had shed 62,000 jobs.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Taxes on corporations and
individuals earning huge salaries should be increased, says the
South Africa's largest labor federation.
	   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said Tuesday that
demands for a reduction in corporate taxes were based on a false
assumption that South African companies paid high rates of tax.
	   COSATU deputy general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said South
Africa's tax revenue as a proportion of national income was lower
than comparable countries.
	   ``This means that South Africa's poor are paying higher
effective tax rates than other sectors of the population, and that
the lower and middle income groups bear a disproportionate share of
the tax burden.''
	   ------
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Telecommunications officials from
30 African
	   nations sat down Wednesday with representatives of the world's
leading private cable and satellite operators to discuss how to
connect the continent to the global information superhighway.
	   On the agenda, according to organizers, was the need to reform
and privatize telecommunications in Africa which remain dominated
by inefficient,
	   state-run monopolies.
	   Some 300 participants in the three-day conference on Global
Connectivity for Africa were discussing the type of needed
regulatory systems, tariff revisions and enhacing regional
cooperation.
	   The groups were also to discuss the kind of cable and satellite
links most appropriate for Africa where there are currently only 14
million telephones for 700 million people.
	   The gathering, which began Tuesday, is sponsored by the U.N.
Economic Commission for Africa, the World Bank's Information for
Development Program, the International Telecommunications Union,
the African Development Bank and the Government of The Netherlands.
	   Private sponsors include the WorldSpace Corp., Siemens,
Teledesic, Iridium and Rascom.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Close to 900,000 ``healthy looking
Malawians'' are carrying the human immunodeficiency virus that
leads to AIDS, Health and
	   Population Minister Harry Thomson says.
	   Confirmed cases has reached 50,975 but this was believed to be
only a small proportion of those infected among Malawi's 12 million
people, he said.
	   ------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia has called for United Nations
and West African peacekeeping troops to be deployed on the
country's volatile northwestern border with Sierra Leone.
	   Information Minister Joe Mulbah said late Tuesday that a
peacekeeping force was necessary to prevent fighting in Sierra
Leone from spreading across the border.
	   ``Having come out of a civil war, Liberia is interested in
improving security with neighboring countries including Sierra
Leone,'' Mulbah said.
	   He denied Sierra Leone's claims that a group of Liberians had
joined rebel factions committing atrocities against civilians in
rural Sierra Leone.
	   Relations between the two countries have been cool since Sierra
Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to power by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force in March.
	   The same multinational force ended Liberia's seven-year civil
war in 1996
	   and has remained in the country to help rebuild the country's
defense forces.
	   ------
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Congolese officials last month arrested
four representatives of an Angolan separatist movement who are
being held without charge, according to a news report.
	   The representatives of the FLEC-Renovada guerrilla army which
seeks independence for Angola's oil-rich Cabinda enclave were
detained May 21 and are in a Kinshasa jail, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila is a close ally of Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and last year promised to crack
down on Cabindan rebels operating inside Congo.
	   ------
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ The government said Wednesday it supports
legislation in Washington aimed at increasing U.S trade rather than
aid in Africa.
	   The African Growth and Opportunity Act offers sub-Saharan Africa
greater access to U.S. markets in return for reduced import tariffs
and political reform.
	   ``The bill is a major shift in America's policy towards Africa
which must
	   be well exploited by Africa through good policies,'' said
legislator Doe Adzaho.
	   The bill was passed in early March by the House of
Representatives and is
	   up for debate in the Senate.

Thai central bank makes rule to encourage debt restructuring 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seeking to relieve commercial banks
from onerous reserve requirements, the central bank has relaxed
loan-classification rules to encourage them to negotiate with
borrowers to restructure problem loans.
	   Thailand's 16 commercial banks and 48 non-bank lenders have an
estimated 1 trillion baht (dlrs 23 billion) in problem loans, equal
to one-fifth of the country's gross domestic product.
	   An economic downturn last year plunged the country's financial
sector into crisis, exposing dozens of finance companies and
several banks as being virtually bankrupt.
	   In response, the Bank of Thailand toughened capital-adequacy
standards, requiring all institutions to raise fresh capital and
boost loan-loss reserves.
	   The continuing regional economic turmoil, however, has made it
difficult for most institutions to raise that capital.
	   The central bank said Wednesday it would permit banks and
finance companies to upgrade loans now classified as ``doubtful''
by persuading borrowers to repay as much of their loans as
possible. Doubtful loans involve borrowers who are less than one
year late; reserves must be equal to 50 percent of such loans.
	   Under the new rules, which took effect Tuesday, once part of the
loan is repaid, the loan can be reclassified as ``substandard,''
and be subject to lower reserve requirements.
	   If, after the restructuring agreement, the borrower makes
payments for three consecutive months, the loan can be considered
``good,'' removing the need for reserves.
	   The lender will have to write off as losses the amount the
borrower cannot repay.
	   The plan would allow the lending institutions to trim the large
amounts of money they must set aside as loan-loss reserves.

Precede ABU DHABI Emirates flies 40 tons of aid to Iraq 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with arrival
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A plane carrying 40 tons of medicine and
medical equipment arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday from the United
Arab Emirates.
	   Emirates President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan ordered the
aid, said Saeed al-Mansouri of the Emirates Red Crescent Society,
	   ``They (the goods) will be flowing from now on. There will be
more shipments... These are the orders of the president,''
al-Mansouri told reporters.
	   Sheik Zayed is the most vociferous among leaders of the Gulf
Arab states to normalize ties with Baghdad ruptured after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``This present is an expression that the people of the Emirates
want to take part in alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi
children, women and the sick,'' al-Mansouri said.
	   He said another plane carrying an additional 40 tons of aid will
arrive Friday. The goods were collected by the Red Crescent
Society, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, which has sent
more than 22 million dirhams (dlrs 6 million) worth of aid to Iraq
since 1996.
	   The charity organization has said it plans to open an office in
Baghdad by the end of the year to coordinate the distribution of
humanitarian aid.
	   The Emirates has sent six planes to Iraq in the past six months
carrying food, medicine and clothing, the official Emirates News
Agency said.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its Kuwait invasion.
The sanctions bar it from exporting oil, except for a limited
quantity under U.N. supervision, and also prohibit direct flights
to the country. The United Nations has to approve humanitarian
flights.
	   Arab states have recently increased their shipments of aid to
Iraq, reflecting widespread opposition to the sanctions among their
populations.
	   The U.N. Security Council says the sanctions will not be lifted
until Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi government says at least 1.5 million deaths during the
past seven years have been caused by shortages brought about by the
sanctions. The U.N. Children's Fund says that 960,000 Iraqi
children are suffering from malnutrition.

U.S. ambassador: announcement on U.S. peace initiative in days 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The United States expects Israel to
reach a decision on a West Bank troop withdrawal within days, not
weeks, as suggested by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel said Wednesday.
	   Ambassador Edward Walker said that while the United States has
not given Israel a deadline to accept a U.S. proposal for a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, ``there is a very
short time frame.''
	   Netanyahu told lawmakers Tuesday that he expected to have made a
decision on an Israeli troop pullback by the end of July, before
parliament goes into summer recess, according to legislator Yehuda
Harel of the centrist Third Way party.
	   However, far-right coalition partners have warned Netanyahu that
they would bring down his government over a 13 percent troop
pullback, and Netanyahu is reluctant to accept the U.S. plan.
	   Walker said Wednesday that the United States will soon make a
decision on whether to pursue its peace iniative. If a failure is
announced, Israel would bear the brunt of the blame because the
Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan.
	   ``It (the decision) is in a matter of days rather than weeks,
but precisely what day and what hour and so on I have no idea
exactly. It depends how the progress goes,'' Walker said.
	   Last month, Israel ignored one U.S. deadline. Palestinian Higher
Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Wednesday that Washington
displayed ``a lack of will to stand firm in the face of Israel's
intransigence.''
	   On Tuesday, U.S. envoy Thomas Pickering asked Jordanian and
Saudi Arabian leaders to delay plans for an Arab summit for another
week to allow the American initiative to play itself out.
	   The Palestinians are pushing for an Arab summit that would
conclude with an announcement that the Arab world is suspending the
normalization of ties with Israel as long as Netanyahu does not
carry out the peace agreement already signed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat traveled to Oman on Wednesday
to lobby for support among Gulf State leaders to convene an Arab
summit. Palestinians have said that they will push for the summit
even if Israel does accept the U.S. proposals.
	   In London, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met Wednesday with two
top Palestinian officials to discuss the troop withdrawal.
According to Maariv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon declined an invitation to
attend the meeting because the government has not yet decided on
the scope of a troop pullback.

At least 20 dead in high-speed German train crash of ICE trains 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany after it crashed into an automobile
that had plunged off an overpass onto the tracks. At least 20
people were killed and 200 injured.
	   The Hamburg-bound train struck the auto going 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour as it approached the station in Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover just before 11 a.m.,
officials said.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line inaugurated in 1991, and the most deadly rail crash in Germany
since 1975 when 41 people died in the head-on collision of two
express trains in Bavaria.
	   A Lower-Saxony state spokesman said the death toll was likely to
climb.
	   At least 13 cars derailed, crashing into each other and the base
of the overpass. Two of the rail cars were destroyed and part of
the overpass collapsed onto the train.
	   Officials said the auto had crashed through the guardrail of the
bridge running over the train tracks, plunging to the rails. There
was no immediate information a driver of the auto or of possible
passengers.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

Four survivors of Antarctic crash get desperately needed medicine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An Indian research station in Antarctica has
provided critically needed medicine for four Russians injured in a
helicopter crash, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The four men _ two mechanics, a doctor and a polar explorer _
were on board an Mi-8 helicopter that crashed Monday shortly after
taking off from the research vessel Academician Fyodorov. Five
other people on board died.
	   Russian officials said Tuesday that the ship, where the patients
were being treated, had only a one-day supply of medicine.
	   Vyacheslav Martyamov, deputy chief of Russia's Antarctic
expedition, said Wednesday the Indian polar station provided the
necessary drugs, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Academician Fyodorov was expected to sail for the nearest
port, Cape Town, South Africa, where the injured will get more
sophisticated medical care.

	   PARIS (AP) _ New strikes threatened French air and rail service
one week away from the World Cup on Wednesday, while Air France
sought to end a three-day-old pilots' walkout already disrupting
some of the event's preparations.
	   The strike at state-owned Air France _ the World Cup's official
carrier _ was a growing embarrassment to the French government,
which also faced walkouts among Paris transit workers Thursday and
national railworkers Friday.
	   Air France mechanics and French train engineers were also
threatening their own strikes.
	   Talks at Air France were resume at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) Wednesday,
after no progress was reported from the first round Tuesday.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   Union leader Jean-Charles Corbet said after the talks Tuesday
that the dispute ``will probably be long, it will probably be
tough. ... and devastating for the balance sheet.''
	   Corbet, head of the SNPL union that represents most of the
airline's 3,200 pilots, accused the airline's president, Jean-Cyril
Spinetta, of merely repeating his offer.
	   While faced with a slated two-week walkout, Spinetta on
Wednesday morning said he remained ``firm on my objectives,''
supported by the government, to cut costs.
	   For the pilots, among the highest paid in the world, the company
wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs (dlrs
83 million) in pay cuts. But it's offered to eventually do away
with a two-tier salary schedule that pays less to new pilots.
	   Air France pilots average 1 million francs (dlrs 160,000),
ranging from 240,000 francs (dlrs 40,000) for new pilots to 1.2
million francs (dlrs 200,000) for 25 years' seniority, the airline
said.
	   The carrier, which managed to report a profit in the last two
years, was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per
day during the strike.
	   Spinetta told Europe 1 radio he couldn't imagine that the
pilots, ``at the moment where the world's eyes are turned to France
for this great celebration that is the World Cup, will paralyze the
country.''
	   France's interior minister criticized the ``lack of
civic-mindedness'' of the pilots, saying he felt ``sadness, almost
shame.''
	   Because of the strike, Jean-Pierre Chevenement told Radio Monte
Carlo, ``France could show itself as a nation that can't organize a
world event anymore.''
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national soccer
team, said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a
three-day weekend to visit their families and were supposed to
resume training Tuesday.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and charter other carriers to meet
its obligations.
	   The airline's mechanics threatened on Wednesday to walk off the
job over pay differences between Air Inter and Air France, which
have been merged. No date was set.
	   Paris subway drivers with the Communist-led CGT union were to
walk off the job Thursday, but the Paris transit authority RATP
said it expected no effect on service since the union represented
only a minority of the employees.
	   At the national railway SNCF, conductors with three unions were
to strike Friday night though Sunday evening. Its engineers
announced plans for a June 10 strike, the day the World Cup opens.

	   ELDORET, Kenya (AP) _ The armies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
began their first joint exercises Wednesday in a U.S.-funded
operation dubbed Exercise Natural Fire '98.
	   U.S. Marines will also participate in the exercise that brings
together about 700 troops.
	   The Defense branch of the Office of Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said the exercise is aimed at giving troops practice in the
planning and execution of ``conflict prevention measures ... and
how to handle volatile politico-military, economic, humanitarian
and ethnic problems in a typical African situation.''
	   On June 15, the exercise moves north to Lodwar near Lake Turkana
for several days of field exercises.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three men have been charged with killing a
prominent Rwandan exile and his driver in Nairobi, police sources
said Wednesday.
	   The accused, David Akiki Kiwanuka of Rwanda and Ugandans Charles
Muhinji Wamuthoni and Christopher Lubanga Mlonda were arraigned in
a Nairobi court Tuesday but were not required to enter pleas.
	   They are charged with the May 16 shooting deaths of Seth
Sendashonga, a former Rwandan minister and member of the Rwandan
Patriotic Front and his driver Jean Bosco Nlingiyubu.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Nairobi.
	   Police said the Rwandan was the son of a businessman who had
confessed to ordering Sendashonga's killing to avenge the death of
his father over a bad business deal with Sendashonga.
	   Police said the businessman's son claimed Sendashonga, who
served as Rwandan interior minister in 1994-1995, ordered his
father killed after the two stole dlrs 54 million in Rwanda.
	   Sendashonga was a member of the predominantly Tutsi RPF that
ousted a Hutu extremist government in Rwanda in July 1994 after a
three-month genocide campaign that killed more than 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Finance Minister Khaled Mahayni has
presented to Parliament this year's budget of 237.3 billion pounds
(dlrs 5.2 billion), an increase of nearly 12 percent over last
year, the official Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   SANA said the new budget listed current expenditure of 117.7
billion pounds (dlrs 2.58 billion), compared to 102.43 billion
pounds (dlrs 2.4 billion) last year and 119.6 billion pounds (dlrs
2.62 billion) for investment.
	   Mahayni, who presented the budget to Parliament Tuesday, said
the new budget will create 86,275 jobs.
	   SANA did not say how much of the budget will go to defense. In
the past 40 percent was allocated to defense.
	   Parliament is expected to approve the budget within the next few
days, SANA said.
	   Mahayni said Syria's economic and financial policies helped
achieve remarkable progress in the fields of agriculture,
irrigation, industry, energy, tourism and services. He said the
major targets of the national economy at this stage are set to
tackle major issues and to continue economic and social
developments.
	   SANA's report said Syria's gross domestic product reached dlrs
15.3 billion last compared. It was 7 billion pounds (dlrs 15.3
million) in 1970.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait and Britain are to sign an agreement to
avoid double taxation before the end of the year, a senior official
said Wednesday.
	   Fawzi al-Qassar, assistant undersecretary at the Finance
Ministry, told the Kuwait News Agency the two countries have
finalized the agreement after three rounds of negotiations. He said
the agreement covers all types of income taxes.
	   Aside from investments by private Kuwaitis, this oil-rich
country has invested billions of dollars in England, part of a
state fund for future generations estimated at around dlrs 40
billion.
	   Taxes on revenues of foreign companies operating in Kuwait could
reach 55 percent, but the government has promised to cut them in a
bid to attract foreign investments.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ About 150 Jordanian truck drivers staged
a sit-in on the Lebanese border Wednesday to protest a Lebanese ban
on the import of some 2,780 metric tons (3,058 tons) of
watermelons, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Some 100 refrigerated trucks have been held up at two border
points on Lebanon's frontier with Syria since May 19.
	   Under an agricultural agreement, Jordanian watermelons receive
duty free access to the Lebanese market from May 1 to June 10 every
year.
	   But Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury said he banned the
Jordanian watermelons after they exceeded the annual quota of 4,000
metric tons (4,400 tons) that is allowed under the agreement.
	   The leading An-Nahar daily said Wednesday the standoff
threatened to damage Lebanese-Jordanian relations, citing reports
that Jordanian authorities have banned the entry of Lebanese
fruits, including truckloads of cherries, in retaliation for the
Lebanese ban.
	   The drivers called on the Lebanese authorities to lift the ban,
saying the watermelons were already rotting.
	   The market price for watermelons in Lebanon has nearly doubled
since the ban was imposed.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ French telecommunications
giant Alcatel Alsthom has signed a dlrs 26 million contract with
United Arab Emirates' telecommunications company to expand the GSM
mobile system in the country's capital, the daily Gulf News
reported Wednesday.
	   The deal is the fifth of its kind by Alcatel in the Emirates,
the English-language paper said. The latest contract with Emirates'
Etisalat telecommunications company will cater for future needs
from expected rising demand in Abu Dhabi.
	   Etisalat maintains a modern GSM mobile system covering the
entire country. The current GSM system in Abu Dhabi provides
service to 100,000 users, the paper said.
	   The latest contract involves introduction of additional macro
and micro cellular technology to improve the quality of the
existing service and accommodate Abu Dhabi's development plans, the
newspaper added.

Ukrainian miners continue protests, striking miner dies

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hundreds of striking miners banged their
helmets and plastic bottles on the pavement outside the president's
office Wednesday, and union leaders said one miner died after
taking part in another protest rally.
	   The miners also demonstrated Wednesday in front of the
parliament building, chanting, ``salary, salary!'' to the constant
drumming of their helmets.
	   Similar demonstrations have been held in conjunction with
scattered strikes that have idled dozens of mines in coal-producing
eastern Ukraine since last month.
	   The miners are demanding the payment of overdue wages _
estimated at up to 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1 billion) _ salary
increases and more government funds for their struggling industry.
	   The Independent Miners Union said one protester died Tuesday in
a hospital in Dnipropetrovsk, after catching pneumonia during a
protest that involved marches and days of sitting on sidewalks.
	   Ihor Tyryntsev, 28, also had a stomach ulcer that was aggravated
by the stress of the protest, the union said.
	   The government last week called on miners to show ``wisdom'' in
a joint search for a solution to the coal industry's problems. It
also blamed some industry leaders for failing to ensure prompt wage
payments to the miners.
	   Ukraine's coal industry is also plagued by safety problems and
outdated equipment. Accidents this year have killed about 170
miners.
	   In the latest accident Tuesday, fire broke out at a mine in the
Luhansk region, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. There were
no injuries among the 127 workers in the mine at the time, it said.

Prosecutor asks for long prison terms in slaying of American boy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CATANZARO, Italy (AP) _ The prosecution asked a court Wednesday
to sentence one man to life and another to 30 years in prison in
the 1994 highway slaying of a 7-year-old American boy.
	   The prosecution wrapped up its case in the appeals trial in this
southern city of the men acquitted in January 1997 of slaying
Nicholas Green during a robbery attempt as he and his California
family drove down a Calabrian highway while on vacation.
	   The lower court jury had ruled there was no evidence to convict
Francesco Mesiano, 23, and Michele Iannello, 28, of murder,
attempted murder and armed robbery, but Italian law allows the
acquitted to be retried by an appeals court for the same crime.
	   Prosecutor Salvatore Murone said Iannello should be convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment -- the maximum under Italian law
-- and Mesiano to 30 years.
	   The prosecution contends that the discoverfy of a pistol in the
home of Iannello's mother after the first trial questioned the
credibility of the defendant, who had testified he had no other
weapons.
	   Nicholas Green's parents donated his organs in an act that saved
seven other lives and inspired a temporary surge of organ donations
in a country where many relatives of accident victims, especially
of children, refuse to allow removal of organs.
	   Italy has one of the lowest donor rates in Europe.
	   Mesiano and Iannello had denied involvement in the death, even
though Iannello admitted to four gangland murders.
	   The prosecution said statements recorded by telephone taps
implicated the pair, but the defense disputed the meaning of the
conversations in dialect.

Italy approves EU Treaty of Amsterdam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Wednesday ratified a European Union treaty
regulating immigration policies and paving the way for the union's
eastward expansion.
	   The Amsterdam Treaty, which must be ratified by all 15 EU
states, would give the EU authority over the visa and asylum
policies of its member nations.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, in an address to the Senate,
said the treaty was ``an important step forward for the growth of
the EU.''
	   ``This confirms that the EU is built on the judgment of the
people; that it is not a product of high-level summits, but an
expression of collective will,'' Dini said.
	   In Denmark, the treaty was put to a popular referendum after
many there expressed concern that a greater EU might not represent
the country's best interests. It was ratified after the majority
voted ``yes.''
	   Germany and Sweden have also ratified the treaty.

Second-largest Thai bank to recapitalize; baht rises 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with baht closing lower in grafs 5-7
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's second-largest commerical
bank plans a second round of capital increases to cope with rising
non-performing loans, the central bank governor said Wednesday.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul, who is spearheading a shakeup of the Thai
financial sector since taking office a month ago, refused to
provide details on the offering for state-owned Krung Thai Bank.
	   The Manager, a local business daily, reported Wednesday that the
bank plans to raise 70 billion baht (dlrs 1.7 billion) in new
capital this year to prop up liquidity.
	   The move would mark the second time Krung Thai Bank has been
forced to raise capital since the Thai financial crisis erupted
last July and triggered a chain reaction of woes across Asia.
	   On Tuesday, the Bank of Thailand increased short-term interest
rates through the bond repurchase market Tuesday to stabilize the
baht, which had weakened from about 39 to the U.S. dollar last week
to close Wednesday at 42.20, its lowest level in 12 weeks.
	   The baht had strengthened to 41.70 in early trading Wednesday
from Tuesday's close of 42.05, but the dollar regained strength
against the baht in the late afternoon after the earlier rising yen
started to show weakness again, dealers said.
	   As of Wednesday's close, the baht had dropped 38.7 percent
against the dollar since the Thai government abandoned its fixed
foreign exchange system last July 2.
	   The interest rate hikes and profit-taking on bank and finance
company stocks sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand index down 0.43
points Wednesday to close at 313.21.
	   Thai firms struggling to survive the current economic crisis are
desperate for lower rates, but the crisis-stricken financial sector
has been reluctant to lend fresh money.
	   Earlier this year, the government seized four small commercial
banks deemed to be too ridden with debt to continue operations.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul said Tuesday that only one of the licenses
from the seized banks will be sold this year in an effort to ensure
the government receives a fair price. The other three licenses will
be sold over the next three years.
	   The U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Inc. is advising the Bank
of Thailand on how to handle the banks' assets. It is scheduled to
submit a proposal to the central bank later this month.

NATO accelerates plans to boost Albanian, Macedonia borders 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies agreed Wednesday to
accelerate plans to help Albania and Macedonia seal their borders
with Kosovo where Serb security forces are crushing a separatist
movement.
	   As of thousands of refugees fled the violence in Kosovo, the
allies said again they will consider deploying combat troops in
Albania and Macedonia, but the prospect of that happening soon were
dim.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed (with an allied force) until
we have solid, well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO
official, who asked not to be named.
	   The official said Kosovo was discussed by the ambassadors of the
16 NATO nations who agreed ``we first of all want to have good,
detailed military advice.''
	   Getting that ``would take several days,'' said the official.
	   It will then have to be reviewed by the NATO defense ministers
who are to meet here June 11-12.
	   In the meantime, the allies accelerated a package of immmediate
measures. This includes bringing forward technical and military
assistance for Albania and Macedonia to help them secure their
borders with Kosovo.
	   The first miliary advisors are to leave in a matter of days.
	   Also, previously scheduled small-scale joint military maneuvers
in Albania and Macedonia were given more priority and NATO's civil
emergency and planning section was told to extend immediate
cooperation with U.N. officials dealing with the exodus of Kosovo
refugees.
	   ``There is a great sense of urgency to get these things
organized,'' said the NATO official.
	   The deteriorating situation in Kosovo served drew comparisons
with Bosnia which spiraled into civil war in the early 1990s as the
NATO allies bickered over how to contain that Balkan crisis.
	   But officials rejected suggestions NATO was again slow off the
mark by taking a cautious stance on deploying a large alliance
force in Albania and Macedonia.
	   ``NATO ... cannot do things which are not guaranteed to be
successful. We are going quickly but we recognize there is a need
for substantive military work'' before a decision to deploy many
thousands of troops is taken, said the NATO official .
	   There have been no reports in Kosovo like those in Bosnia of
massive civilian roundups or massacres by Serb forces.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted comparisons to the ethnic war
in Bosnia. More than 200 people have been killed in the southern
Serb province where 90 percent of the population are ethnic
Albanians.
	   NATO's Kosovo policy is guided by the belief the province should
not become independent but be given back the autonomy it once had
within the Yugoslav Republic.

	   Thai firms struggling to survive the current economic crisis are
desperate for lower rates, but the crisis-stricken financial sector
has been reluctant to lend fresh money.
	   Earlier this year, the government seized four small commercial
banks deemed to be too ridden with debt to continue operations.
	   Chatu Mongkol Sonakul said Tuesday that only one of the licenses
from the seized banks will be sold this year in an effort to ensure
the government receives a fair price. The other three licenses will
be sold over the next three years.
	   The U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Inc. is advising the Bank
of Thailand on how to handle the banks' assets. It is scheduled to
submit a proposal to the central bank later this month.

Anti-censorship group accuses Belarus of tightening media controls 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An international organization campaigning against
censorship accused Belarus on Wednesday of tightening restrictions
on the news media and ``flagrant violations of international
standards of freedom of expression.''
	   The group Article 19, named after the provision in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights guaranteeing the right to freedom of
expression, demanded the abolition of a series of measures
introduced this year by authorities in the former Soviet state.
	   In a report called ``The Noose Tightens,'' the London-based
voluntary organization said the latest measures throw Belarus'
democratic transition into reverse.
	   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has drawn international
criticism for his crackdowns on independent media, including
shutting down critical newspapers. Last month, a U.N.-affiliated
group named him as one of the world's 10 worst enemies of press
freedom.
	   His latest measures include a ban on the non-state media's
access to official information, creation of a government-appointed
council with censorship powers, and a requirement that anyone
distributing information about laws, government decrees and other
legal measures be licensed by the government.
	   New amendments to Belarus' already restrictive Law on Press
include more stringent requirements for registration of newspapers,
authority for a state committee to suspend publication of a
newspaper or periodical for up to three months without a court
ruling, and a prohibition on publication of ``information damaging
the honor and dignity of government officials.''
	   Article 19 said a correspondent for the independent newspaper
Narodnaya Volya who attempted to determine how many people involved
in emergency work in the contaminated zone around the Chernobyl
nuclear reactor after the 1986 catastrophe were still alive was
told by the Ministry of Emergencies that non-state newspapers could
be refused access to any information.
	   ``This has particularly disturbing connotations in the light of
past cover-ups of information on Chernobyl by the Soviet
authorities, with disastrous results for peoples' lives and
health,'' the group's report said.

Chechen official: Professional army nearly formed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya has almost completed the formation of a
professional army, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   More than 2,000 people have qualified to enlist since Chechnya
began forming an army from disjointed field units a year ago,
Chechen national guard commander Magomed Khambiyev said, according
to ITAR-Tass.
	   He refused to say how big the army will be when fully formed.
	   Beside physical health, the criteria for enlistment included
``moral qualities, such as faith in Allah, and political
dependability,'' Khambiyev said.
	   ``In the long run, it will be a well-organized and technically
equipped force capable of carrying out any tasks to protect the
state from foreign aggression,'' he said.
	   Chechen separatists had dealt a humiliating defeat to Russia's
much larger but demoralized and underfinanced army two years ago,
forcing Russia to withdraw its troops from the mainly Muslim
region.
	   The key issue of Chechnya's political status was left
unresolved. Chechnya insists it is an independent state, even
though no country, including Russia, has recognized its
sovereignty.

Italy's star cautious on injury recovery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, pegged as Italy's leader at
the World Cup, said Wednesday he is only halfway to top form but
will not rush his return from injury.
	   The Juventus of Turin star was included on the 22-man roster
even though a lingering right thigh strain has kept him away from
the team's practices for two weeks.
	   ``It's true I feel good, but on a scale from 1 to 10, right now
I am at 5,'' Del Piero told reporters.
	   ``It is clear that to play I have to be in good form. I don't
want to take risks. There is no room for false steps,'' the striker
said. ``The World Cup is long; it certainly does not end with the
game against Chile.''
	   Italy, the 1994 runner-up, departs for France on Friday and
opens Group B play against Chile at Bordeaux June 11.
	   Del Piero will work one-on-one with the team trainer Thursday.
	   ``The healing process is going well. It's all going according to
plan,'' said Del Piero, 23. ``But I can't say any more than that.
We'll wait until the work intensifies and we will see how I hold
up.''
	   A healthy Del Piero, who scored a career-best 31 goals for
Juventus this season, would start in attack alongside either
Christian Vieri or Fabrizio Ravanelli.
	   Del Piero was injured in the Champions Cup final May 20.

Japan's premier proposes nuclear non-proliferation forum 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister proposed an international
forum on Wednesday to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the
wake of recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   Speaking before a Parliamentary committee, Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said Japan should take the lead in convening a
meeting of non-proliferation experts from around the world.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will formally announce
the proposal in a speech scheduled for Thursday in Tokyo, a foreign
ministry spokesman said.
	   Japan, the only country ever to suffer a nuclear attack, has
been among the harshest critics of India and Pakistan after those
nations carried out nuclear weapons tests last month. It has
punished both countries by suspending economic aid.
	   Preparations will begin soon on holding a non-proliferation
forum later this summer, possibly in the city of Hiroshima,
Japanese evening newspapers reported.
	   The foreign ministry official, who declined to be named, said
the site and date of the forum has not been decided yet, but
indicated the experts meeting may not be convened until autumn.
	   On Tuesday, forty-six countries in the Conference on
Disarmament, including Japan and the United States, demanded that
India and Pakistan immediately cease testing nuclear arms and join
in the global move to eliminate the weapons.
	   Foreign ministers from the U.S., Japan and six other leading
nations plan to meet in London on June 12 to coordinate efforts to
bring nuclear activities in India and Pakistan under international
supervision.

Officials: Most Ukrainian conscripts sick 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ As many as 750 out of every 1,000 army
conscripts in Ukraine had to be hospitalized for various illnesses
last year, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper also said that 32 Ukrainian
servicemen were found to be carrying the AIDS virus in 1998,
compared with 64 in all of 1997.
	   The newspaper quoted Maj. Gen. Mykola Vovkodav, head of the
Defense Ministry's Main Military Medical Department. It did not
elaborate.
	   The problem of unhealthy conscripts is common across the former
Soviet Union. Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev says an
average 14 percent of conscripts in his country have serious health
problems, 11 percent are underweight, and many suffer from ``mental
instability.''

	   CIVIL servants will get the lowest pay rise since 1983 this
year, with senior staff getting slightly more than lower-ranked
staff despite calls for parity.
	   The Civil Service Bureau yesterday recommended 5.79 per cent for
middle and lower-salary bands among the 190,000 civil servants, and
6.03 per cent for upper-salary band and the directorate.
	   The salary increases, if approved, will cost the government an
estimated $2.48 billion extra a year.
	   Secretary for the Civil Service Lam Woon-kwong announced the pay
offer following discussions with Executive Council members and
union representatives. The offer for the upper- and middle-rank
civil servants was made in line with the recommendations by the Pay
Trend Survey, which reflected the average salary increase for
private sector employees last year.
	   The survey also suggested a pay rise of 5.01 per cent for
lower-band civil servants. Civil service unions had earlier
requested an adjustment of 6.03 per cent across the board.
	   Mr Lam said the offer was ``fair and reasonable'' and consistent
with the system used in the last two decades when salary increases
for upper-level staff were higher than those of the lower ranks.
Last year, pay adjustments were 6.81 per cent for middle and
lower-band staff, and 6.9 per cent for the upper ranks.
	   The pay rise for lower-band civil servants would be adjusted to
be on a par with that of the middle band, and would be higher than
proposed by the survey, Mr Lam said. Chan Cheung-yee, chairman of
the Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council, said he was
disappointed with the offer, while the other three consultative
councils said it was ``acceptable''..
	   Mr Chan criticised the government for not considering existing
economic difficulties and the widening salary gap between upper and
lower-level civil servants.
	   He said members would discuss whether to present a
counter-proposal to the authority, but he ruled out the possibility
of any industrial action.
	   Leung Chi-chiu, of the Senior Civil Service Council, said the
offer was ``generally acceptable''.
	   Junior staff of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants'
Association are to discuss the offer tonight.
	   Counter-proposals are to be presented before Saturday, and the
Executive Council will make a final decision later this month.
	   Meanwhile, The Frontier, which will have three seats in the new
legislature, said it would vote against the proposed pay rise,
convenor Emily Lau Wai-hing said.
	   ``We are against the gap of pay rise levels between the senior
and junior civil servants. The lower-ranked civil servants should
get more in face of the economic downturn,'' Ms Lau said.
	   Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) chairman, Lau
Chin-shek, said last night the union was undecided on its voting
directions.

	   ALAM Flora Sdn Bhd will officially take over solid waste
collection and several other urban services from the Petaling Jaya
Municipal Council for a two-year interim period from July 1.
	   Council (MPPJ) president Datuk Mohamad Nor Bador said
adjustments to the schedule of services would be made during this
period.
	   He said the urban service committee meeting later this month
will discuss, among other things, a paper prepared by the urban
services department on the takeover.
	   The department had been commissioned to finalise details of the
takeover including the number of council staff and vehicles to be
absorbed by Alam Flora and the renting of the department's building
at SS7 in Kelana Jaya.
	   It will also look into the quantum to be paid for waste disposal
services.
	   On the takeover process, Mohamad Nor said the council had
already carried out studies based on the experience of other local
authorities such as in Johor Baru and Kuala Lumpur.
	   The MPPJ is also in the process of setting up a unit to monitor
and receive complaints on garbage disposal services.
	   He said the unit will be placed under the MPPJ health
department.
	   All 54 private garbage contractors under monthly contract with
the council will be absorbed by Alam Flora.
	   Alam Flora will start preparatory work for the takeover this
month despite having scheduled a three-month trial run in April.
	   Among services the company will be providing is the collection
of rubbish and grass-cutting in the township.
	   The company is expected to collect garbage in residential areas
thrice a week, six times at condominiums, commercial and
institutional areas, twice at industrial areas and daily at the
markets.

	   A 38-YEAR-OLD female police officer and her two daughters
remained in critical condition late last night after apparently
giving their dog mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
	   They were trying to save their dog after it collapsed during an
anti-tick shampoo treatment.
	   Veterinary surgeons said the shampoo contained the highly-toxic
insecticide Amitrax, normally used to rid farm animals of ticks, or
blood-sucking parasites.
	   Ms Chong Tak-ying, 38, and her 16 and 14-year-old daughters Lee
Wai-chung and Sau-chung, all suffered respiratory problems and
confusion when they were admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital about
3 am yesterday.
	   Their condition deteriorated rapidly and they were moved to the
Intensive Care Unit when they lapsed into unconsciousness.
	   They recovered consciousness about 10.30 pm, but their condition
remained critical late last night.
	   The dog, a mixed breed, was found dead at their home in Sai
Kung.
	   Dr Cheung Wai-lun, chief of the hospital's Accident and
Emergency Service, said they were trying to save the victims by
providing breathing support and heart strengthening injections.
	   ``We know from friends of the victims that they had used a drug
called Amitrax _ a flea-killing wash _ on their dog. And the
victims' symptoms match possible side-effects of the drug. But we
had to wait for the police test for confirmation,'' said Dr Cheung.
	   The family, who live in Kwun Hang Chuen in Sai Kung, were
reported to have been given an anti-flea chemical by a friend. They
applied it to their dog on Monday night.
	   According to Ms Chong's brother, the family had called a friend
about the use of the chemical when they discovered there was
something wrong with the dog.
	   They were told to give the poisoned dog water, but it soon
collapsed. They then tried to revive it with mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
	   They felt discomfort afterwards and immediately called the
police for help.
	   Dr Cheung said Amitrax was a commonly used insecticide made of
highly concentrated chemical solutions which should be diluted in
500 to 600 times of water before use.
	   He warned that a few grams of the chemical could be dangerous if
improperly used. He said drinking it or leaving skin exposed to the
chemical could be harmful to pets and humans.
	   He said the chemical could suppress the function of the central
nervous system resulting in dizziness, cramps, coma, and lower
heartbeat and blood pressure.
	   Neighbour Ms Lui said she heard someone crying about 3am before
the police arrived.
	   The dog's carcass was taken away by the police for examination.
	   Pet-shop owner Ms Kwong said she would not recommend the use of
concentrated chemicals for flea treatment as it could be poisonous.
	   ``Any overdose could be fatal to the pet and human,'' she said.
	   She said there were less-concentrated anti-flea shampoos for
dogs and also flea controlling pills. The main purpose of the
shampoo and drug was not to kill the fleas but to stop its ability
to breed.

<TEXT>
	   THE picture which appeared in the New Straits Times on May 6
showing the carcass of a rare whale shark in Dungun port,
Terengganu, surrounded by fishermen who had sold its fins and tail,
churned many a stomach.
	   To some, it was just one less fish in the sea.
	   Why should anyone care if we have put marine life in our oceans
in peril?
	   Why should we be concerned that wasteful fishing practices,
result in the trapping of non-commercial species which would
ultimately lead to their depletion and extinction?
	   Is anyone even aware that 1998 has been declared the Year of the
Oceans by the United Nations?
	   A whole can of worms was opened with that story which was
front-paged in the NST.
	   Besides the general indifference shown by Malaysians, (fishermen
in particular), towards marine conservation, the authorities
appeared to display apathy bordering on a lack of responsibilty
towards the incident.
	   When contacted by NST, Fisheries Department chief enforcement
officer Kapt (R) Wan Fatah Wan Omar had said the department would
not take action against the fishermen as ``they had caught the fish
accidentally''.
	   The whale shark is the largest known species of fish and can
grow to 20 metres in length.
	   Harmless and a plankton feeder, the gentle giant dwells in
oceanic and coastal waters of tropical and warm temperate areas.
	   It has no commercial value.
	   Department of Fisheries, Marine Parks Section head Kevin Hiew
was later asked to provide an explanation for Wan Fatah's response,
which had raised the ire of the public and conservationists.
	   His answer shed light on the incident and was perturbing, to say
the least.
	   The law does not afford protection to whale sharks which have
been classified by the World Conservation Union's Red List as a
species known to be ``endangered, vulnerable or rare''.
	   Section 27(1) of the Fisheries Act 1985 (amended in 1993)
states: ``No person shall fish for, disturb, harass, catch or take
any aquatic mammal or turtle which is found beyond the jurisdiction
of any state in Malaysia.''
	   The penalty for contravening this section is a fine not
exceeding RM5,000.
	   However, the whale shark, according to Hiew is a ``fish'' and
thereby not covered under this section.
	   Hiew also added that no state in the peninsula afforded
protection to fish such as the whale shark if caught within three
nautical miles of its jurisdiction.
	   In short, the laws in the country concerning marine conservation
are inadequate, Hiew said.
	   Maritime Institute of Malaysia's senior analyst Mohd Nizam
Basiron added that Malaysia's marine protected area system should
be extended to include the open seas.
	   This notion, he said, was being proposed by scientists who
considered entire oceans and seas, such as the South China Sea, as
a large marine ecosystem.
	   Despite the overwhelmingly gloomy outlook, the Fisheries
Department is in the midst of formulating a regulation under the
Act which would afford protection for aquatic animals not covered
by existing legislation.
	   For the sake of these ``unprotected species'' and the peace of
mind of conservationists the world over, the sooner the regulation
is drawn up, the better.
	   Meanwhile, what are we doing to make people understand that
exploiting wildlife in the deep sea or overfishing is perilous to
our own well-being?
	   An international World Wide Fund for Nature (Malaysia) report
presents the grim facts.
	   At least 60 per cent of the world's 200 most valuable fish
species are either overfished or fished to the limit.
	   Some such as the Atlantic halibut and bluefin tuna have been
fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
	   In some estuaries, more than 80 per cent of key nursery habitat
has been lost to development.
	   Less than one per cent of the oceans and coasts have been
designated as protected areas.
	   Scientific officer with the Malaysian Nature Society Melissa
Renganathan said there should be greater efforts to educate the
public on the presence of rare fish and other marine creatures.
	   ``When people are more aware of the importance of our marine
ecosystems, only then can we progress towards conserving our marine
ecosystems,'' she added.
	   The Fisheries Department has taken a step in the right
direction.
	   Targeting the fishing community, Hiew said the department had
carried out regular dialogue sessions with fishermen on why there
was a need to gazette marine parks which fishermen felt were a
threat to their livelihood.
	   ``We have held talks, slide shows and shown videos on why
certain marine animals like turtles have to be protected,'' he
said.
	   He added that youths were taken scuba diving in an effort to
cultivate an appreciation for marine life at a tender age.
	   ``We hope that by seeing for themselves the beauty the sea
possesses, they will be more concerned about its protection,'' he
said Is there more to be done?
	   WWF scientific officer Mohd Nasir Abdul Salam offered some
suggestions.
	   The establishment of protected areas, including sanctuaries and
buffer zones, are important for conserving critical habitats in
their natural state.
	   The construction of artificial reefs in inshore waters can
contribute greatly to the replenishment of our diminishing fishery
resources and also protect the inshore waters of traditional
fishermen from encroachment by trawlers or other commercial
fishermen.
	   Highly-selective fishing equipment should be developed and
promoted in order to minimise the capture of non-commercial fish
and immature commercially-important fish.
	   The time for change is now. Let there be a resounding call for
action.

Missing uranium causes upset, but plant says it's a mere technicality 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DOUNREAY, Scotland (AP) _ Reports that enough uranium to make a
half-dozen nuclear warheads is missing from Britain's Dounreay
processing plant provoked outrage Wednesday, but authorities said
it was a mere technicality and that the material was never there.
	   The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority confirmed that an
internal inquiry listed 170 kilograms (374 pounds) of uranium as
missing, mostly from processing work in the mid-1960s. But it said
that was due to a 1 percent overestimate in the amount of material
that went into the plant then.
	   ``The question that you could have 170 kilograms still inside
the processing plant is absolutely preposterous. The plant simply
couldn't continue to operate. It would be detectable,'' the
authority's chief executive, John McEwan, said in a BBC radio
interview.
	   The controversy, which prompted demands for a judicial inquiry,
was only the latest at the plant in northern Scotland.
	   In April, Dounreay attracted international attention when 4.3
kilograms (9.46 pounds) of highly enriched uranium and 0.8
kilograms (1.76 pounds) of spent nuclear fuel were shipped there
from Georgia, a restive former Soviet republic. Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Britain accepted the shipment to prevent the threat of
nuclear proliferation
	   The Scottish National Party, which has long demanded that
Britain scrap nuclear weapons unilaterally and opposes Dounreay in
principle, urged a South African-style truth commission to examine
the matter of the missing uranium, with staff past and present
exempted from official secrecy rules.
	   ``We are now in the ludicrous situation where we are hoping that
the uranium was used to make British atom bombs because the
alternatives are even harder to stomach,'' party spokeswoman
Roseanna Cunningham said.
	   The missing material was listed in a recently published
inventory of the contents of a reprocessing shaft.
	   Inquiries in 1963 and 1973 found that the missing material was
likely due to uncertainty in estimates of the uranium input to the
plants.

	   THE hawker centre at the Jalan Othman wet market will only be
re-opened after the Petaling Health Department certifies the stall
owners responsible for the cholera outbreak have upgraded food
preparation methods and are healthy.
	   A Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ) spokesman said the
14-day closure issued by the health department had expired on
Sunday.
	   ``The 86 stall owners can operate only after the department
conducts a check to determine the health status of the owners and
the condition of the stalls,'' she said.
	   The closure was enforced under Section 18 (1)(d) of the
Prevention and Control of Infections Diseases Act 1988 was issued
on May 15.
	   The stalls were closed after a cholera outbreak early last
month.
	   There were 15 reported cases of which 11 were confirmed. Four
hawkers were identified as carriers.
	   Two had been admitted to the Universiti Hospital while another
two were treated as outpatients.
	   The market was upgraded during the two-week period.
	   Repairs were made to the centre's roof, gutter, tiles and septic
tank while the old rubbish bins have been replaced.
	   MPPJ had covered up the centre's exposed water tank recently and
had taken measures to prevent the spread of cholera.

	   UP to 100,000 jobs will be created over the next 18 months and
an unemployment fund will be set up under a 12-point job-creation
package to be announced today by Financial Secretary Sir Donald
Tsang Yam-kuen.
	   The package of measures will be discussed in today's first
meeting of the Task Force on Employment to combat joblessness.
	   Unemployment has hit a 14-year high of 3.9 per cent.
	   These measures include advancing government projects to create
100,000 jobs, increasing retraining and improving the Labour
Department's Employment Service Centres.
	   The government estimates 13,000 jobs will be created by the West
Rail project, 16,000 at the new airport and related services, and
another 11,000 in the civil service.
	   While Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had initially rejected the
creation of an unemployment allowance, the worsening economic
crisis has made it imperative to offer such an allowance to jobless
workers.
	   The fund will not come from taxpayers but will be set up under a
mechanism similar to the provident fund.
	   Sir Donald appealed to 500 organisations and individuals in
April to put forward proposals on how to solve the unemployment
problem but only 73 have responded.
	   Sir Donald will ask members of the taskforce today to deliberate
on some of the major proposals put forward to him.
	   The proposals also include: Tax cuts for both business and
salary taxpayers.
	   Suspension of the Supplementary Labour Scheme.
	   Developing high-technology industries and encouraging small and
medium-scale industries.
	   A report prepared by the Financial Services Bureau has painted a
gloomy picture of the labour market over the next few months.
	   ``On the demand side, growth of the economy in 1998 is forecast
to be somewhat slower than in 1997. As such, employment conditions
are also expected not to be so good,'' according to the latest
labour market situation report.
	   It says the structural changes in the economy will lead to the
re-orientation of manpower requirements and bring about further
dislocation in the labour market. The increase in the labour supply
due to mainland migrants and the returning emigrants will also
aggravate the problem.
	   Professor Francis Liu Ting-ming, head of the Centre for Economic
Development at University of Science and Technology and a member of
the taskforce, warned of the negative effects of a deficit budget
as proposed by various sectors. ``This is a disastrous move,'' he
said. ``A deficit budget will encourage speculative attacks on the
Hong Kong dollar and have a chain effect on the economy.''

	   KUALA KRAI, Mon. - The Rural Development Ministry has given
contractors involved in the construction of 3,000 kilometres of
rural roads until October to complete the work.
	   Its Minister Datuk Annuar Musa said the road projects would cost
about RM185 million.
	   He said it was important for the contractors to complete the
work fast as the ministry had to process other applications for
other rural road projects.
	   He added that the ministry had to set the deadline for the
contractors in order to achieve its objective of providing up to
3,000km of rural roads a year.
	   ``Based on previous results, the rate of completion is only
about 2,000 kilometres of roads per year.
	   ``But this year, we hope all the contractors will rectify their
weaknesses and speed up their work,'' he told reporters after
opening the newly-completed Jalan Kampung Jerek in Dabong.
	   He said the construction of rural roads would be expanded to
remote areas and Orang Asli settlements.

Japanese military leader visits Russian air base 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's military chief examined Russian combat
jets at an airbase near Moscow on Wednesday, including some his
country is interested in buying, a news agency reported.
	   Adm. Kazuya Natsukawa, chairman of Japan's Joint Chiefs of
Staff, arrived in Russia on Sunday on an eight-day visit intended
to boost bilateral military cooperation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto pledged last fall to increase military contacts as part
of effort to conclude a peace treaty by 2000.
	   Natsukawa visited the Kubinka air base where he examined the
MiG-29, Su-25 and Su-27 combat jets and watched demonstration
flights, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Japan has expressed interest in buying several Su-27s for
evaluation and had its pilots train on the planes in Russia earlier
this year.
	   Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally
ending World War II because of a territorial dispute over four tiny
islands in the Kuril chain seized by Soviet troops at the end of
the war.
	   The next session of a Russian-Japanese committee in charge of
preparing a peace treaty will be held in Tokyo later this month,
said Grigory Karasin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, according
to the Interfax news agency.

Three more suspects arrested in Europe-wide roundup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with quotes from French Interior Minister
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police on Wednesday arrested three more
suspects believed linked to Muslim militants plotting a terrorist
attack around the World Cup. The raid follows a Europe-wide roundup
of scores of suspects.
	   Authorities seized documents during the morning arrests, but no
arms or explosives were found, police said on customary anonymity.
	   The arrests completed the list of suspects in an investigation
led by anti-terrorist Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere. The three can be
held up to four days without judicial action.
	   Altogether 15 people in France have been placed under formal
investigation _ one step short of being charged _ for allegedly
plotting a terrorist attack.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Wednesday that
police had intercepted telephone calls between the suspects in
recent weeks, which revealed ``a colorful, but worrying language.''
	   Chevenement said police heard suspects talking of ``a coach
coming from abroad to give advice to the new recruits'' _
apparently a coded message using soccer terminology.
	   ``The threat of terrorism can never be ruled out,'' Chevenement
said, urging the French and foreign visitors to be ``vigilant''
during the World Cup and warn police of suspicious activity.
	   Last week police in France, Belgium, Italy, Germany and
Switzerland arrested at least 88 people. They confiscated about
dlrs 150,000 in cash, a computer, documents and videocassettes _
including a video showing a training session for Algerian
militants.
	   But authorities seized neither weapons nor explosives in those
roundups either, French police sources said.
	   Police said the raids targeted networks loyal to Hassan Hattab,
leader of an Armed Islamic Group faction, who reportedly wants to
bring the Algerian conflict to Europe.
	   Algerian militants fighting a 6-year-old insurgency have staged
terrorist attacks in France to pressure Paris to cut its ties with
the military-backed government of the petroleum-rich North African
nation.

For release any time WORLD CUP '98: `Reggae Boyz' insist they're more than a promotion 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-SOC--World Cup
By HOWARD CAMPBELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica is likely to be the novelty act
of the World Cup, just as Cameroon was in Italy in 1990. It also
wants to emulate Cameroon's performance by reaching the
quarterfinals.
	   At 1,000-1 odds to win the World Cup, Jamaica is given scant
chance of even making it to the second round. But the underdog tag
is something the ``Reggae Boyz'' have used to their advantage.
	   Relying on stingy defense, Jamaica has been anything but
pushovers for soccer giants like Brazil and up-and-comers such as
the United States. In their qualifying campaign, the Jamaicans
amassed an unbeaten home record of 30 matches over three years.
	   Coach Rene Simoes, a Brazilian import, insists his team isn't
built around stars. But the Jamaicans have more than their share of
individual flair.
	   In Deon Burton, who plays for Derby County in the English
Premier League, they have a goal-hungry forward with opportunistic
instincts.
	   Overlapping fullback Ricardo Gardener, who scored in a 1-0 upset
win over Colombia last August, could be a sensation in France.
	   With a reggae theme song and even a Jamaican tourism campaign
built around them, the ``Reggae Boyz'' certainly are colorful.
Offensive-minded they are not, scoring two or more goals only five
times in their 20 qualifying games.
	   Still, Simoes is credited with transforming Jamaican soccer and
making the nation capable of becoming the first Caribbean team to
reach the finals since Haiti in 1974.
	   A youth coach in Brazil, Simoes became Jamaica's technical
director in late 1994 and courted businesses to get his program off
the ground.
	   Jamaica's fortunes rose in 1995 when wins over higher-rated
opponents like Zambia and Mexico earned it FIFA's Best Mover award.
	   That type of form paid off in October, when a 0-0 tie with
Mexico earned Jamaica the third qualifying spot in the CONCACAF
zone. Jamaica won nine of its last 16 matches, beating Mexico, El
Salvador and Costa Rica along the way. Jamaica also tied crucial
away games against the United States, Canada and Honduras.
	   The pre-Cup run peaked in February, when Jamaica held defending
world champion Brazil to a 0-0 tie in the Gold Cup.
	   Jamaica has stumbled since, producing no fireworks against Iran,
South Korea and Macedonia. At home, Simoes was harshly criticized
for giving eight spots in his 24-man lineup to England-based
players of Jamaican heritage, including defender Danny Maddix of
Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea wingback Frank Sinclair.
	   ``I don't care what people think. Once they are good players and
can fit in they will play,'' Simoes said. ``If the squad that I
have does not improve, I have to look elsewhere.''
	   Jamaica plays another first-timer, Croatia, on June 14 and has
two-time titlist Argentina and another debuting team, Japan, to
contend with. Simoes says his squad will be ready.
	   ``We're not going there to promote tourism,'' he said.

	   KUALA Lumpur City Hall will actively support long-term
Government programmes like the Rakan Muda programme to help produce
a caring society and a generation of well-balanced youths.
	   Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said City Hall would
continue to work closely with Government agencies in ensuring the
programmes were successful.
	   He said the local authority will also work closely with the
Youth and Sports Ministry as well as non-governmental organisations
in promoting culture and arts programmes to fulfill the city
residents spiritual needs.
	   Kamaruzzaman said this when launching the Kuala Lumpur Music and
AV Fest 98 organised by Manalom Management Sdn Bhd at the Phoenix
Plaza Shopping Centre in Cheras.
	   The three-day fest featuring 20 large and small exhibitors has
the best sound and music instrument and production companies
talking part.
	   He said private organisations, agencies and associations should
help organise cultural activities.
	   He said City Hall had in the past extended assistance to them in
carrying out such activities including allowing them to make use of
its facilities.
	   ``The fast pace of development in the city will be more
meaningful if there is a balance, both between the physical and
spiritual form. City Hall has allocated RM765,000 this year for
promoting culture and the arts,'' he said.
	   ``We have also allocated RM380,000 this year for promoting
musical activities through the Kuala Lumpur Orchestra.
	   ``We have, at the same time, allocated RM1.4 million for
promoting public functions which includes the City Day
celebrations.''
	   He congratulated Manalom Management Sdn Bhd for organising the
fest and also the Pusat Rakan Muda Phoenix Plaza for its commitment
in promoting a community music programme.
	   Phoenix Expo Centre director S.S. Huang said the fest was aimed
at getting people under 40 years to spend their leisure time
wisely.
	   He said the Rakan Muda Phoenix, located on the top floor of the
Phoenix Plaza Shopping Centre, had ventured into a new programme
themed ``Music for Everyone''.
	   He said the programme was aimed at inculcating an appreciation
for music, both contemporary and traditional, among the youth.
	   He said the music courses will include a wide selection of
instruments like the piano, guitar, harmonica, keyboard, organ,
drum, trumpet, saxophone and traditional instruments like the
gamelan.
	   ``We have a team of professionals willing to act as advisors and
mentors in order to ensure the success of the programme while we
welcome more mentors,'' he said.
	   ``Scholarships will also be made available to talented music
students under this programme. I would like to request assistance
from any establishment or organisation that can contribute in any
form.''
	   Huang said the public could access the Rakan Muda Phoenix
homepage at http://rakanmuda.com for details.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French air and rail service faced new strike
threats one week away from the World Cup on Wednesday, while Air
France held new talks to end a three-day-old pilots' walkout.
	   The strike at state-owned Air France _ the World Cup's official
carrier _ was a growing embarrassment to the French government,
which also faced walkouts among Paris transit workers Thursday and
national railworkers Friday.
	   Air France mechanics and French train engineers were also
threatening their own strikes.
	   Talks at Air France resumed at 3:20 p.m. (1320 GMT) Wednesday,
after no progress was reported from the first round Tuesday.

	   THE government plans to create tens of thousands of jobs by
bringing forward short-term and medium-term infrastructure
projects.
	   Projects would be launched ahead of schedule over the next 22
months, sources said.
	   The measure is part of a concerted effort to put the economy _
which recorded 2 per cent negative first quarter growth and has
unemployment at a 14-year high _ back on track.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen is to discuss
measures to create jobs with senior government officials today.
	   Secretary for Works Kwong Hon-sang said yesterday the number of
jobs to be created by the scheme immediately would not exceed
40,000.
	   But a source said the total number of jobs to be created in the
next 22 months would ``not be too far off'' that figure.
	   Mr Kwong said the plan would be limited by complicated works
procedures such as public consultation and land resumption.
	   ``There are more than 1,000 public works projects. Not all can
be scheduled to start early,'' he said.
	   ``But all relevant departments have received instructions to
study whether their projects can start as soon as possible.'' Mr
Kwong said it was wrong to believe that fewer jobs from
infrastructure projects would be available after the completion of
Chek Lap Kok airport.
	   ``In the past two years, we have spent more money on routine
works projects than we have spent in the airport core projects,''
he said.
	   Such routine projects have cost the government more than $20
billion in the last two years. Pending infrastructure work included
rail and housing projects, Mr Kwong said.
	   In the next five years more than $235 billion is slated for
infrastructure spending, far exceeding the $155 billion spent on
the airport in the last few years.
	   ``On top of these investments, there will certainly be works
from the private sector which, for the past years in Hong Kong,
contributed to a very large proportion of our annual total
construction investment,'' Mr Kwong said.
	   ``There will definitely be a lot of jobs.'' Hong Kong
Construction Association secretary-general Patrick Chan Wing-tung
said the government should study three factors carefully. ``Skilled
workers take time to train,'' Mr Chan said.
	   ``Not only do unskilled and inexperienced workers affect the
quality of work, their safety could also be at a higher risk.'' The
government must also schedule projects carefully, he said.
``Different types of workers are required at different stages,'' he
said. ``Some types of workers may still be out of work at certain
stages . . . The government must therefore carefully schedule these
projects.'' Mr Chan said the government might be able to solve
unemployment among construction workers, but he believed most of
those out of work were not from the construction field.
	   Chan Yuen-han, Federation of Trade Unions spokesman and
legislator-elect, said the government should help jobless workers
go into the construction sector.
	   Ms Chan said retail, catering and transport workers were finding
it hard to achieve ``lateral movement'' in the job market because
the government failed to help.

	   NEW Sepang District Council president Abdul Karim Munisar has
placed cleanliness high on his agenda to ensure foreigners arriving
at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport will have a positive
image of the country.
	   He said council staff will have to work harder to ensure
cleanliness as the airport would be opening at the end of the
month.
	   Speaking during his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he said he
had made the rounds of the district to identify illegal garbage
dumps.
	   He said council officers had been directed to find ways of
clearing such eyesores along road shoulders including the grey
areas of Jalan Kajang-Serdang and Jalan Kajang-Puchong.
	   Abdul Karim said residents should help improve cleanliness in
the district.
	   ``The council will install a hotline besides setting up public
relations department to enable residents make complaints on
services as well as offer views to improve the performance of the
council.''
	   On strengthening of the council's administration, Abdul Karim
said by-laws involving parking, pollution and littering will be
enforced strictly.
	   He said the council would liaise closley with those involved in
mega projects like the KLIA, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya and Multi-Media
Super Corridor.

A slow death for dikir barat?, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   HISTORY is being slowly erased again, as we speak. This time,
dikir barat, an age-old art which has long been part of the
Malaysian society -and Kelantan people in particular - is facing a
certain threat of being phased out.
	   It started on May 28, when the Kelantan State Government decided
to ban dikir barat performances with immediate effect.
	   All local authorities were also ordered to withdraw permits
issued for any dikir barat performance in the State.
	   The decision was apparently made on the grounds that some
quarters had abused the permits issued to them.
	   Instead of just holding dikir barat performances, the organisers
included other forms of entertainment which ``contradicts Islamic
teachings,'' Kelantan Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
was reported to have said.
	   Point taken, that if someone breaks the rule, action should be
taken and the person should be penalised appropriately.
	   Much as one applauds the Kelantan Government for its ``swift
action'', one cannot help but be dismayed by its repercussions of a
blanket ban.
	   It reminds one of an old Malay saying marahkan nyamuk, kelambu
di bakar (loosely translated as ``burning the entire mosquito net
when you're merely annoyed by the mosquitoes'').
	   Back to the matter, if indeed there were organisers who used
their permits to stage more than just dikir barat, then by all
means punish the bad boys - warn them, fine them, reprimand them,
whatever. But stamping out the art altogether is being hasty.
	   But looking back, phasing out art forms in the name of religion
seems to be a favourite pastime of the Kelantan government.
	   Over the years, it has already applied similar pressure on its
people's art like the traditional puppet theatre - wayang kulit
(the performers were advised to ``modify'' their puppets and the
method of storytelling) and dance dramas menora and mak yong
because they were deemed as not being ``in line with Islamic
teachings''.
	   Due to that, the number of ``practitioners'' has dwindled. It
has interfered with the passing down of the arts, which has been
done in the State through many generations.
	   This is certainly a sad situation, especially when dikir barat,
wayang kulit, mak yong and menora could be viewed as very important
tools in disseminating information.
	   They are entertaining (and rather safe) and most importantly,
educational.
	   In the case of dikir barat, humour and the spirit of
``comradeship'' are the main elements, and they are blended with a
certain storyline, usually with a very strong message at the end.
	   Dikir barat, while maintaining its basic characters and style,
is dynamic as it could also be very contemporary in its content.
	   The tukang karut (the storyteller) uses his wit to dissect any
current issue, which could turn out to be a rather strong form of
social comment.
	   Could this be the thing which has made those in office paranoid?
That the dikir barat people and their followers are using the art
for ``diabolical'' purposes?
	   (Remember Indochine, the French film on the history of Vietnam
where theatre people influenced their countrymen through their
mobile ``opera''
	   performances?) If we have to be paranoid, then a little control
will definitely be a better way rather than destroy. At least the
``net'' could still be used to ward off the mosquitoes.
	   Plainly, the authorities could keep show organisers in check by
making sure they don't abuse the permits for dikir barat shows.
	   The drastic action of banning affects people across the board.
While dikir barat performers are deprived of making a living, its
people the entertainment, non-Kelantan folk will never know and
understand the State and its people through their rich cultural
imprint and heritage. And don't even think of its touristic
potential.
	   Are we supposed to revert to the 70s when the ``Kelantan
experience'' was only mainly savoured through special programmes
and slots on radio and television? (Dendang Rakyat was one of the
main outlets).
	   There were (still are) also recordings of dikir barat
performances on cassette tapes, but that is not the same as
experiencing the live performance.
	   Well, whatever it is, the ``strangulation'' of artistic
expression is something that saddens us the most, and this does not
only apply to just Kelantan.
	   When everyone around us is talking about preservation with a
high level of adaptability, we seem to be more intent on burying
something that is still alive and well.
	   The question is: How can we be sure of our existence, if we keep
rejecting everything (harmless) that has always been part of us?

Opposition group claims three attacks, at least three killed report.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An outlawed Iranian opposition group claimed
responsibility for a bombing and two mortar attacks Wednesday on
government facilities that killed at least three people.
	   A bomb exploded Tuesday at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office
in Tehran. Official sources, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said at least three people were killed and two injured.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency earlier denied the
bombing was the work of the Mujahedeen Khalq, but Tehran's Governor
General Mohammad Reza Ayatollahi said Wednesday that the group was
behind the attack, Tehran television reported.
	   In a statement Wednesday, the Mujahedeen said it also carried
out two mortar attacks Tuesday on the Central Command Headquarters
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Defense
Industries Organization in the capital.
	   The Mujahedeen said the attacks were in retaliation for the
killing of its members in recent months by the Iranian government.
The Farda daily reported Tuesday that 50 fighters from the outlawed
group had sneaked into Iran from the porous border with
Afghanistan.
	   State-run radio reported only a bomb explosion Tuesday at a
government building in northern Tehran, but gave no further
details.
	   Also Wednesday, police evacuated guests and staff at the
Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran following a bomb threat made by a
caller, sources said. No bomb was found at the hotel, which is
close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates, the Mujahedeen said that in its ``surprise'' attack
on IRGC headquarters, ``several Revolutionary Guards were killed or
wounded and the headquarters' buildings were damaged.'' It did not
claim any casualties for the attack on the defense industries
building.
	   However, Iranian radio said security men foiled an attempted
attack by ``saboteurs'' at IRGC headquarters Tuesday and the
perpetrators fled. It gave no other details.
	   Newspapers reported contradictory casualty figures in the
explosion at the prosecutor's office. One newspaper said five
people were killed, while another reported that nine people also
were injured. A third said two women and three men were killed.
	   A police official at the scene said a bomb in a briefcase caused
the explosion at the prosecutor's office. However, IRNA said the
explosion was caused by explosive material being brought to the
court as evidence in a case under investigation when it went off
accidentally.
	   Bombings are rare in Tehran where security is tightly
controlled. The last reported bombing in Tehran was four years ago
when two devices went off in a commercial district but caused no
fatalities. Those explosions remain a mystery.

	   BINTAN ISLAND, Riau (JP): On a warm May afternoon above a
forested cliff, Ria Bintan Club Med Resort executives gathered to
celebrate the resort's first summer season with 150 corporate
clients and 230 journalists from around the world.
	   General manager Mehdi Serrour and Club Med CEO Philippe
Bourgougnov played hosts to the guests enjoying the resort's lush
grasslands, clear waters and above all, the complimentary
three-day, two-night stay at the resort.
	   This included fine wine and dining at any of the resort's four
restaurants, a circus school, a multitude of activities from trying
trapeze acts, archery, windsurfing, scuba diving to animation
theater, and staying in luxurious rooms, most of which have a sea
view.
	   The resort, opened on Oct. 24, 1997, is Club Med's newest
addition to its current 120 villages in 36 countries worldwide,
along with one in Cuba that also opened last year.
	   At the gathering, Serrour would not say what the extravagant
Club Med cost to build, but a corporate client figured that the
cost could have reached more than Rp 15 billion.
	   The Ria Bintan Club Med Resort (RBCM), built on 20 hectares, has
guests enjoying a nearby 218-hole golf course, which does not
belong to Club Med, an exclusive beach, beautiful architecture and
aquamarine waters of the South China Sea.
	   With Singapore less than an hour away by boat, day trips or two
to three-day trips are available from Bandar Bentan Telani Ferry
Terminal, Bintan Resorts.
	   The resort has 308 rooms and two heated swimming pools.
	   According to Serrour, the resort comprises 15 percent of the
S$3.5 billion investment pie significantly baked by the widely
diversified Salim Group and Singapore's Keppel Group.
	   The Salim Group developed Bintan Beach International Hotel on
23,000 hectares in a consortium comprising Riau's provincial
administration, the Indonesian Navy and a group of Singaporean
investors.
	   The Indonesian group owns 60 percent of the project and the rest
belongs to Singaporean investors.
	   The consortium has managed to turn the swamps and jungle along
the island's northern beaches into a posh tourist resort. Its hotel
list includes the Rasa Indah, Sedona Bintan Lagoon, Bintan Lagoon
Beach and Resort, RBCM, Banyan Tree Bintan, Mana Mana Beach Club
and the Nirwana Garden Resort.
	   Despite a debilitating economic crisis and the heated political
situation, RBCM can still afford luxuries.
	   Target
	   When asked about cost-cutting measures, Serrour shrugged. ``We
have a chairman who believes a lot in brands. It wouldn't be Club
Med if we cut costs. I'd say we'll see more and more of the Club
Med logo... the same all over the world,'' Serrour said.
	   ``There are usually two choices. Cutting cost or doing our all
to fill up the resort by having more people coming in, even in low
season. Cut costs or make incomes better. We chose the latter.
Again, it is not about throwing money out the window.''
	   With strong rumors pointing at a 50 percent occupancy rate as
the cause of the extravaganza to entertain media and corporate
clients, Serrour said a 70 percent occupancy rate was the target.
	   ``We are more or less achieving what we had wanted to at this
point of the year. We may have less Koreans or less Indonesians
(Asians in general) than expected (due to the crisis),'' Serrour
said.
	   ``We have, however, gained from the European side. Last week, we
had 250 French people who stayed two weeks, which made all the
difference. A lot of Japanese in the same week stayed for three
days.
	   ``Europeans, because they come from so far off, take full
advantage of their time and vacation here.''
	   Weekday room rates cost an adult Rp 1.2 million, a child between
four and 11 Rp 780,000, and a child between a few months old and
three years Rp 165,000.
	   Weekend rates cost an adult Rp 1.5 million, Rp. 960,000 for
children between four and 11, and Rp 210,000 for infants.
	   High season room rates differ and cost about Rp 300,000 more for
adults and children between four and 11.
	   This excludes lunch, dinner and sports activities costs.
	   Serrour reiterated that Club Med was not currently focusing on
finance.
	   ``How can we... when you have just started something, you don't
expect to make money tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,'' Serrour
said.
	   He said the resort was currently trying to improve in terms of
service and staff.
	   ``Simply by listening and watching the life of the resort (the
guests), we are going to see in terms of operation what we are
going to propose to our guests.
	   ``For instance, sports. Are we going to talk mainly in terms of
land sports (golf) or water sports ...''
	   The staff at RBCM comprise 66 expat general organizers
(full-fledged entertainers and helpers) and 350 Indonesians. The
whole staff represents 37 nationalities and 26 languages.
	   It was also ``a little impossible'' to cut down on staff,
Serrour said.
	   ``The people who perform in the night shows are the same who
take care of the kids, the bar, the same who teach you windsurfing.
If they are fired, how are we to fulfill our promises to our
guests?''
	   He explained that almost all of them enjoyed being trained to be
jacks of all trades.
	   ``You have to understand that all of them are living out a
concept,'' Serrour said.
	   ``They (general organizers) are 20 to 25 years of age, positive
about life. They get to live near the beach and live the lives of
teenagers... work all day and all night, party all day and all
night, eat the quality of food that they eat here... what reason
would they have not to be happy?''
	   This might be true to the last word.
	   However, the service staff complained of being underpaid.
	   Sam (not his real name), said that the ``French chef nicely
pockets Rp 24 million every month'' while the ``Indonesian chef''
makes close to ``Rp 1 million only''.
	   Sam pointed out that even if the Indonesian chef was not ``of
the same level... or not as qualified or not holding a position
equal to that of the French chef, the gap is still too wide''.
	   Club Med around the world boasts 76,000 beds, 12 villages in
Asia, 89 in Europe and 17 in North America.
	   At the press conference on May 9, Bourgougnov, Club Med's CEO,
said 14 percent of Club Med's business came from Asian general
managers.
	   ``Almost 92 percent of the GMs vacationing in Indonesia come
from the Asia-Pacific region,'' Bourgougnov said.
	   ``Seventeen percent from Australia, 20 percent from Japan, 5
percent from Singapore, 14.5 percent from Korea and GMs from the
remaining Asian countries contribute 34.8 percent,'' Bourgougnov
said.
	   He lists the facilities worldwide -- among them about 14,000
service staff, 40 different sports and 950 sailboats. Then there
are over 200 restaurants, 30,000 annual parties and an average of
27 million meals served a year.

	   A SENIOR government official yesterday endorsed the
establishment of a cruise-ship dock in Hong Kong to attract
high-spending tourists.
	   This was a key component in a package of measures unveiled by
Secretary for Economic Services, Stephen Ip Shu-kwan, to help boost
flagging tourist arrivals.
	   The Hong Kong Tourist Association's executive director, Amy Chan
Cheng Yi-yim, said an improved terminal for cruise ships in Hong
Kong could lead to growth of 7-17 per cent in the market.
	   Tycoon Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Group last week said it was
considering building berths for cruise ships. Other property
developers are also believed to be interested in the project.
	   An HKTA study into the building of such a terminal will be
submitted to the government next month.
	   Mr Ip said the government was also looking at simplifying
immigration rules for visitors from Russia and Eastern Europe,
despite some reservations expressed by the Security Bureau.
	   Each year, about 800,000 Russian tourists visit the mainland,
but only about 5,000 come to Hong Kong, he said.
	   Mr Ip said a proposal to promote the Aberdeen wholesale fish
market, in a similar way to San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, was
also being considered.
	   Ms Chan, however, admitted the measures might not help the
sector's short-term recovery in the face of regional economic
crises.
	   ``About 70 per cent of tourists to Hong Kong come from Asia, and
the volatile situation in Asia this year makes it difficult to
project the figure for tourist arrivals,'' she said.
	   ``Judging from the present trend, we are not likely to see any
growth in the number of tourist arrivals this year.'' ``If
economies in the region do not improve, there will still be
downward adjustments for visitors coming from Asia.'' Copyright

China sets up new national standards for software 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has started a new system of standards for
all domestically produced computer software, an official report
said Wednesday.
	   Government inspectors will examine software products to see if
they deliver what they claim and meet national quality standards,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. Consumers will be able
to check to see if software has a certificate that shows it passed
the examination.
	   China's computer industry has grown at an annual rate of more
than 50 percent for the past seven years, according to official
figures.
	   Last year 3.5 million PCs were sold in China. The domestic
software industry grew by more than 30 percent last year over the
previous year, with sales of more than 11 billion yuan (dlrs 1.3
billion) in 1997.
	   Analysts say China has made progress recently in fighting
illegal copying of domestic and foreign computer software.

	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
buried rail cars.
	   Officials said the auto had crashed through the guardrail of the
bridge running over the train tracks.
	   Although it remained unclear, evidence at the scene suggested
that the car struck the train as it passed under the overpass. The
nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while the cars behind
derailed and jackknifed into each other.

An oasis of fun at luxury Ria Bintan Club Med Resort, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   Fun and frolicking in these times is hard to imagine, but not at
the Ria Bintan Club Med Resort, located on the north coast of
Bintan island. Club Med, celebrating one of its first holiday
seasons in Bintan since its opening last October, invited
journalists from several countries for a promotional trip from May
8 to May 10. The Jakarta Post was represented by Yogita Tahil
Ramani, who wrote the following stories.
	   BINTAN ISLAND, Riau (JP): A beach can leave a deep impression,
especially if it's on the premises of Club Med Ria Bintan on the
South China Sea.
	   Considering the situation in Jakarta -- with people stressed to
the hilt -- a few blessed reporters decided to see what Club Med
had to offer and report on it. Period.
	   Winda, a radio broadcaster, said: ``They (most people) cannot
afford it (happiness). We are journalists. Let's just be that, add
color and get it over with.''
	   A bus trip out of Hang Nadim Airport Batam changed this frame of
mind.
	   We passed forests of sprawling, untamed greenery and bald bark
parched white from the heat during the 10-minute ride to the Telaga
Punggur Ferry Terminal.
	   The roads were almost empty. A 30-minute ride took us to Bandar
Bentan Telani Ferry Terminal, Bintan Resorts, and from there, in
two words, Club Med.
	   The first thing that humbles the newcomer here is the
tranquility of the sea.
	   The blue vastness is given a backdrop of celestial skies. The
water is clear, enabling you to see its seabed of fine sand.
	   In the afternoon, we swam like children waiting for gigantic
waves to hit us again and again.
	   There were vast stretches of pepper-colored sand inviting people
to play in it.
	   Daydreaming in the evening.
	   More people played in the sea than on the beach. Some flaunted
skin-colored bikinis, while a few others dared to flaunt even less.
	   Night show
	   After a rich dinner, things started with the night show.
	   The theater where it was held could seat more than 400, but
people seemed to be sprawling all around.
	   Aside from an exotic Brazilian snake-dancer, pirouetting to a
ballad and executing Janet Jackson steps on stage, the evening's
highlights included ballet-dancing to Whitney Houston's I Will
Always Love You by a Moroccan Club Med general organizer (GO),
Aziz, and the chef, Vivi.
	   Aziz exhausted all of his admirable efforts in getting his arms
in perfect ballet position -- his padded chest, his blond coiffeur
of a wig and his tutu in place. Vivi was the picture of a gurgling
seal, flapping his arms left and right in sheer white tights.
	   Usually the night shows are followed by what Club Meders call
Crazy Sign.
	   The entire place was lit with burning lamps, lining the swimming
pools and gardens. People gathered around the pools, while general
manager Medhi Serrour requested guests to join him in recognizing
the kitchen staff, the front-desk employees, housekeeping and other
employees lined up on the stage.
	   Lights focused on a huge, central symbol pasted on the outer
portion of the building, the classic trident with a dot -- the
symbol of Club Med.
	   Amid the applause, a realization dawned on us.
	   These people have built a city within the island. A city
populated with more Europeans than Asians. A city where the only
signs of Indonesia emerge from nature's sights and sounds and of
course, the service staff.
	   It is so detached from reality, and yet, a reality. A dreamland.
It did not seem to be part of Indonesia.
	   Crazy Sign brought us back to earth.
	   People rushed to line up in rows and dance to a euphoric beat,
following the dance steps of those onstage.
	   They sang, folded hands and twirled hips to Un Dos Tres, Ale Ale
Ale and danced zombie-style for Free From Desire. Songs ranged from
YMCA to the disco version of My Heart Will Go On.
	   All of a sudden, confetti started raining on us.
	   Next thing we knew, we were forming a locomotive, dancing all
the way to the main lounge.
	   Here, everybody, including the CEO and other chef-de-villages of
other countries, were doing the swing, salsa, lambada and all sorts
of dance steps to I Feel Good, Shout and other great oldies. The
crowd later shifted to the nightclub.
	   There is something so deliciously daring, so becoming of people
to appraise one another in a crowded scene. Particularly, on a
dance floor.
	   A trapeze swinger who had no sense of rhythm on the floor,
stomped songs away while he danced.
	   Hips swung in and circled the air, hands chopped them, bodies
became entangled around others and there were eyes that felt but
refused to see. They all danced.
	   Quitting time was 4 a.m., only after some managed to do the
Jaipongan, a traditional West Javanese dance, to a heavy-metal
number.

	   BENTONG, Mon. - About 100 people, mainly supporters of Pas, were
dispersed by police at the toll plaza here today after they held a
peaceful protest over the proposed hike in toll rates along the
RM1.5 billion upgraded Gombak-Karak highway.
	   District police chief Supt Hasanudin Hassan said the people,
armed with placards and banners, had gathered at the toll plaza as
early as 7.30am.
	   Hasanudin, who arrived at the scene at 9am, said the protestors
claimed they were Pas members but police believe that outsiders
were also involved.
	   ``We reminded them it was an illegal gathering as no police
permit was granted and advised them to disperse, which they
complied with,'' said Hasanudin.
	   He added that police learnt of the gathering about two weeks ago
and had monitored the situation, including putting on standby
members of the General Operations Force.
	   Pahang Pas secretary Abdul Malek Yusof said the gathering was to
protest the proposed hike in toll rates at the Gombak and Bentong
toll plazas to be imposed by MTD Prime Sdn Bhd, an associate
company of MTD Capital Bhd.
	   At present cars are charged RM1.90 at the Gombak toll plaza and
50 sen at the Bentong toll plaza.
	   The new rates at the Gombak toll plaza will be RM4.20 for cars;
RM8.40 for Class II vehicles (up to six tyres and two axles);
RM12.60 for Class III vehicles (more than six tyres, three axles);
RM2.10 for Class IV vehicles (taxis) and RM4.20 for Class V
vehicles (buses).
	   At the Karak toll plaza, the new rates are RM2.40 (cars); RM4.80
for Class II vehicles; RM7.20 for Class III vehicles; RM1.20 for
Class IV vehicles and RM2.40 for Class V vehicles.
	   All the increases are 2.75 times higher, except for taxis which
pay 1.5 times more.
	   Motorists now use a six-lane dual carriageway for 17.8km and a
four-lane carriageway for 46.2km.
	   ``The proposed hike in toll rates is untimely because of the
economic slowdown and will further burden motorists. The protest is
to show our resentment and to appeal to the authorities to be more
considerate,'' said Abdul Malek.
	   On May 20, the Government deferred implementing the new toll
rates from today to June 15.

	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

	   THE economic slump has led to a three-fold increase in
post-natal depression cases recorded by the Prince of Wales
Hospital.
	   Dr Dominic Lee Tak-shing, of the hospital's Department of
Psychiatry, said he was now seeing eight new cases a week _ double
the normal workload.
	   In addition, there are more than 20 mothers on the waiting list
for treatment.
	   He said the hospital received three times more patients than
before the economic crisis.
	   The waiting time has also lengthened from about two weeks to
three months, according to Dr Lee, an assistant professor in the
Department of Psychiatry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
	   He explained that mothers who worried about the finances of
their families were even more vulnerable to post-natal depression _
the emotional distress some women suffer after childbirth.
	   Money has now become the prime concern for many families, which
worry about how they will manage to feed and raise their children.
	   Dr Lee said some mothers were laid off after their maternity
leave, while others worried about their husbands' career prospects
during times of economic upheaval.
	   ``Also in the economic slump most husbands would not risk taking
time off work to spend with their wives.
	   ``However, most women after childbirth need the support and
attention of their husbands,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, in a two-week survey by Baby Magazine of 449
first-time mothers, nearly 33 per cent said they suffered from
post-natal depression.
	   Unionist and newly elected legislator, Lee Cheuk-yan, said he
would lobby different political parties to press for a new law on
paternity leave.
	   He estimated that about 54,000 employees a year would benefit if
the legislative requirement for seven days of paternity leave was
in place.
	   He said employers would have to pay out about $110 million a
year in paternity leave _ only 0.04 per cent of Hong Kong's total
payroll.

European Union reaches out to its Mediterranean partners 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian quotes
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) - The European Union comes together with
its Mediterranean partners Wednesday, trying to get the economic
cooperation process back on track after last year's derailment by
Mideast issues.
	   A year ago in Malta, the EU's 15 foreign ministers gathered with
their 12 Mediterranean colleagues to talk trade and investment,
only to see their meeting blown away on the turbulent winds of the
Mideast peace process.
	   Even at the inaugural meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean
conference in Barcelona in 1995, heady ideas also fell victim to
disputes, that time over human rights.
	   The Palermo meeting is an informal session with no set agenda.
Organizers hope it will bring the conference back to its original
idea of creating a European-Mediterranean free trade and security
zone by 2010.
	   Last year, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and then-Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy were the stars of the show, agreeing to
resuscitate the moribund Middle East peace talks. Today, those
talks are still stuck, and neither Arafat nor Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to turn up here, but Mideast
peace remains an unavoidable issue.
	   ``We want a clear statement which shows the Europeans stand in
support of the process of peace and expresses their willingness to
revive the process,'' said Farouk Kaddoumi, head of foreign affairs
for the Palestine Liberation Organization. ``And they have to refer
to those who stand as a detriment to this process.''
	   Israel views the EU as pro-Arab and wants no significant role
for Europe in the peace process beyond supplying funding.
	   ``France and Britain have supported Israel since its creation,''
Kaddoumi said. ``Now, they claim the Europeans are friends of the
Palestinians. I hope that is true ... and that they cut all
economic assistance to the Israelis.''
	   No direct Palestinian-Israeli contacts are expected here,
however.
	   EU foreign ministers said in a statement that ``This meeting is
aimed at providing a new momentum to the Barcelona process.''
	   Mediterranean nations sell half their exports to EU countries
and provide the EU with 20 percent of its energy supplies. At the
same time, half of the Mediterranean nations' imports come from
Western Europe. The EU's per capita income is a dozen times higher
than most of the North African and Mideast nations.
	   Ministers here are continuing efforts to come up with a
Euro-Mediterranean Stability Charter and the establish
confidence-building measures for the region.
	   On the economic side, the 27 were to discuss support for
economies in transition, private investment in the non-European
Mediterranean countries and eventual realization of the free-trade
zone.
	   Joining ministers from the European Union are officials from
Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Traffic police will recommend to the
Government this month that hand-held computers be made available to
all police units.
	   Twenty of the devices have been undergoing trials since May 8.
	   Deputy Federal Traffic Police Chief Assistant Commissioner
Azizan Md Aras said today the trials had led to the detection of 30
per cent of the motorists with outstanding summonses.
	   ``The trial will end this month and the units will be handed
over to the police highway patrol unit and other police districts
for further trials.
	   ``Based on the outcome of the trials, we will submit a proposal
to the Government to equip all police formations in the country
with the device,''
	   he told reporters at his office in Bukit Aman today.
	   With the hand-held device, police can check a motorist's
outstanding summonses by scanning the bar code on the reverse of
his identity card or entering the registration number of his
vehicle.
	   A laptop computer in the police vehicle will act as the server
for the units.
	   Police have downloaded about four million traffic and criminal
records into the main frame computer for access through the
hand-held units.

	   BINTAN ISLAND, Riau (JP): In a resort that induces sleep more at
dawn than at night, most prefer to stay in bed past 10 a.m.
	   Still, early risers have nothing to worry about. The Waterfall
Terrace greets those up by 7 a.m. with a sumptuous breakfast.
	   In the afternoon, first timers who preferred not to get splashed
and flipped around by waves lapping the beach opted instead for
scuba diving, windsurfing and canoeing.
	   Facing the beach, a stone wall. Facing that, a white trampoline.
	   Amid elephants, a juggler, trapeze artists and the blessed
absence of a lion.
	   This was the open air circus team, which the management said was
unique to Club Med resorts worldwide.
	   The school of circus teaches flying trapeze acts to first
timers. In the evening, following the night show of Indonesian
dances, was the circus show.
	   Three men and a woman swung on bars and flew past each other,
doing single or double somersaults.
	   Melanie, an Australian female trapeze artist, is reportedly the
only woman from Club Med villages worldwide to have dared to try
and master the double somersault in midair.
	   She fell once.
	   She picked herself up and tried again.
	   To the utmost delight of the audience and her colleagues, she
swung, double-somersaulted in midair, caught the swinging bar and
swung back to safety. She basked in the appreciative response.
	   There were also comic turns cloaked in magic routines.
	   One had Aziz, dressed as a clown, playing the stick-and-fire act
with two other colleagues, who were dressed in a motley array
colors and cloth. One of them had false buck teeth. After having
taken in liquid and holding it back, there was the punch line.
	   Or, rather, the punch sound.
	   An elephant broke wind. Loudly.
	   Much as the poor guy wanted to laugh, he had to stifle his
guffaws. With those ``flood gates'' bulging from his closed mouth,
it seemed highly complex, anyway.
	   At one point, a Japanese woman in the audience was called on to
participate in an act.
	   After making tissues and a jug ``disappear'', Aziz held out his
two fists and commanded her to guess in which of the fists were the
tissue papers or the jug hidden. Frustrated with not being able to
find anything in either, the woman decided to look someplace else.
	   She settled for Aziz's thankfully clothed rump.
	   Every time she checked there, she would conveniently hide her
face behind a quivering fan and giggle shyly. Aziz rationalized
with her.
	   ``How can I hide a jug there ... you sex maniac you,'' he
screamed.
	   There came a point when it all had to end. Some went for a last
dip in the sea before the dreaded packing of bags.
	   Such is the business of fun; and people from the CEO down to the
housekeeping lady reminded guests in their own ways that they built
the resort, worked hard and shared the fun.

	   THE Cabinet Tuesday approved in principle a Provincial
Waterworks Authority proposal to raise water rates by an average of
37 per cent.
	   Under the proposal, the rates will be raised every three months
by Bt.50 per cubic metre. Households will face the highest rise of
Bt5 per cubic metrestarting in January next year while factories
will be charged up to a maximum of Bt11.22 per cubic metre from
this month.
	   Deputy Government spokesman Pan Phuengsujarit said residents who
use less than 20 cubic metres per month account for 86 per cent of
all users and are presently charged Bt3.75 per cubic metre.
Government agencies and state enterprises as well as small
factories which represent 10 per cent are charged Bt5 per cubic
metre per month. Large factories, accounting for 4 per cent of
users, are charged a minimum of Bt6 per cubic metre per month.
	   After a three-hour debate, the Cabinet agreed that a rise in
water rates was inevitable because the PWA has been suffering
losses and the rates have not been raised for five years.
	   The PWA's future investments will also push up the cost of water
production. The cost of production in PWA's 600 existing sites has
reached Bt30 per cubic metre.
	   Fearing strong public opposition, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
however ordered Deputy Prime Minister Panja Kesornthong, who
oversees the PWA, to submit to the Cabinet next week details of the
impact on low-income earners. The PWA was also ordered to present
information in its explanation on the need to raise rates to the
public.
	   Cabinet members reportedly asked the PWA details about its
operational cost and questioned the high losses incurred from water
leakage and the insurance on water metres which reaches Bt460
million.
	   Unlike the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority which has a board
of directors to decide on a rise in rates, PWA needs approval from
the Cabinet.

New Russian prime minister makes first foreign trip 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said
Wednesday he would discuss his country's economic crisis with
French leaders but that a financial aid package was not the main
focus of the trip.
	   Speaking to reporters after his arrival in Paris, Kiriyenko also
called for greater Russian integration into the world economy.
	   It was the 35-year-old Kiriyenko's first overseas visit since
the Russian parliament reluctantly confirmed President Boris
Yeltsin's choice earlier this spring, and the trip was seen as a
test of his credibility.
	   ``The issue is not aid concretely for Russia,'' Kiriyenko said
responding to a question as to whether he would ask French leaders
for support of a bailout package to boost the Russian ruble.
	   Western creditors are reportedly discussing the possibility of
putting together an important aid package similar to those used to
rescue Asian economies, but so far the Russians have tried to down
play the need for such a dramatic step.
	   ``We should be more integrated in the industrial process and the
entire array of economic relations with other countries,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   During his two day visit that began Wednesday, Kiriyenko was to
meet with French President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and leading French businessmen.

	   CHAT Pattana Party secretary-general Suwat Liptapanlop has
agreed to allow deputy leader Korn Dabaransi to assume the party's
leadership because of his seniority and for the sake of late party
leader Chatichai Choonhavan.
	   Suwat and Korn, both MPs for Nakhon Ratchasima, reached the
agreement at a recent private meeting. They also agreed that the
authority of the party leader would be reduced and decisions be
made by the executive board, an informed Chat Pattana source said
Tuesday.
	   The source quoted Suwat as saying he would not leave the party
at this stage for the sake of Gen Chatichai, whom he respected, as
he wanted to help the party weather the political situation.
	   Both Korn, who is Chatichai's nephew, and Suwat had reportedly
been eyeing the post of party leader since Chatichai died last
month.
	   Suwat, who may defect to another party, believes Parliament will
be dissolved by the end of the year, said the source.
	   Meanwhile there was no surprise at a New Aspiration Party
meeting Tuesday when Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Snoh Thienthong were
re-elected party leader and secretary-general respectively.
	   The party admitted Muanchon Party leader Chalerm Yoobamrung and
Araya Chumduang, its other MP. Chalerm was named NAP deputy leader.
	   Gen Chavalit named 10 academics and representatives of various
professions to the NAP executive board, including Poosana
Preemanoch, Surasak Nananukul, Gen Pat Akkanibutr and Likhit
Dhiravegin.
	   Elected deputy leaders were Sukhavich Rangsitphol, Chucheep
Hansawat, Wan Mohammad Noor Matha, Kiatchai Chaichaowarat,
Chingchai Mongkoltham, Ruangwit Lik, Bokhin Polakula, Sornchai
Montreewat, Surasak and Chalerm.
	   Boonchong Veesommai, Montree Danpaiboon, Likhit, Somphan
Lertnuwat, Kaew Buasuwan, Chatchai Ia-sakul, Areepen Uttrasin,
Adisorn Piengket, Pairote Suwanchawee, Kriang Kalpatinant and
Ekkaporn Rakkwamsuk were named deputy secretaries-general.
	   Speaking at the meeting, Chavalit alerted the party to a new
general election but did not predict when it would be.
	   Chavalit also gave party officials 30 days to complete the
formulation of strategic plans for fielding candidates to run in
all the 400 single-candidate constituencies nationwide.
	   ''Every one of us wants the boat to weather all conditions. We
must repair it where it is damaged, give it a new coat of paint and
refurbish it to ride the raging economic and social waves and carry
us to our destination,'' he told the meeting.

	   DIAGNOSING the cause for the huge drop in Japanese tourists to
Hong Kong will be high on the agenda for the Chief Secretary when
she leaves today for Japan and the United States.
	   Speaking after yesterday's Executive Council meeting, Chief
Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang said she would
meet Japanese tourism representatives to figure out what had
discouraged Japanese travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
	   ``We will try to find out what the problems are and hope to come
up with measures to attract more Japanese to visit Hong Kong,'' Mrs
Chan said.
	   When asked about the slump in the stock market despite the
government's announcement of measures to boost the economy, Mrs
Chan replied: ``You need to give it a bit of time.'' She said the
measures were to increase the liquidity of capital in the banking
system to stabilise the property market and boost tourism.
	   She explained that the market needed time to understand what the
measures were, since the government had only made the announcement
last Friday.
	   ``The existing volatility in the stock market is a reflection of
what's happening in the region.
	   ``As we've explained on many occasions, we are a small
externally oriented economy and we cannot be immune from the
contagious effects of these current financial difficulties,'' she
said.
	   Mrs Chan believed the medium and long-term economic prospects
were good after this painful adjustment.
	   ``Part of the purposes of this visit to Japan and the States, on
one hand, is to address concerns about the performance of the
economy, but to also underline our economic fundamentals, our
strengths, why we feel we are well-positioned to come out of the
shock rather quicker than other countries,'' she said.
	   After a three-day stop in Japan, Mrs Chan will head for
Washington, New York and Seattle in the US.
	   She said she would lobby US senators for extension of the
most-favoured-nation status to China during her stops in Washington

	   YOGYAKARTA (JP): Free forms of three-dimensional objects fill
the modest gallery with various sculpting and engraving techniques.
One which especially catches the eye is Gentle Seduction, a wooden
statue two meters high. It reminds people of a three-legged
creature in science fiction films. There are bends like joints in
the wooden legs which seem to present an unsteady standing
position.
	   The three wooden legs support a ceramic cluster of forms
suggesting something that is growing.
	   This is the work of Japanese sculptor Shigeyo Kobayashi, 41,
whose exhibition at the Cemeti Gallery here through June 3 is his
second.
	   The graduate majoring in metal arts at the Bunka University in
Sapporo, Japan, was a student at the Indonesian Arts College in
Denpasar, Bali from 1994 to 1995 -- which may explain locals'
familiarity with some of his works.
	   Kobayashi combines both organic and nonorganic materials in a
strongly decorative style.
	   He uses forest wood, clamshells, coral, seeds, brass and
aluminum. He processes all the material into imaginative forms to
give a message which the layman might not always easily be able to
share.
	   One serial work, Listening for a crack, is composed from forms
resembling split, gigantic peanut shells in colorful hues. Growing
buds are seen in the open shells.
	   This work reflects Kobayashi's frequent theme of the
relationship between nature and man. He is apparently much inspired
by the process of the growth of plants which in their turn produce
very esthetic forms.
	   He says one source of his inspiration is his birthplace in
Sapporo.
	   ``I always remember my grandmother's story of how plants absorb
the energy of the earth and the sun when in growth. If the energy
is not sufficient, plants will take it from man. That is why many
people become crazy when plants reappear toward the coming of
spring,'' he said.
	   For Kobayashi the mythology has become a fact. In Sapporo he
used to feel weak and shaky, but in Bali where he settled for some
time, he said he feels strong.
	   He said he learnt to make use of natural material but always
tries to avoid using too much of it, and combines his creations
with unnatural material.
	   The resulting exploration is striking and even provocative
works.
	   Bright contrasting colors, decorative beads made of seeds or
metal and exotic spiral forms constitute the dominant esthetic
language in his works.
	   The tendency toward such a decorative style is influenced to a
certain extent by the traditional Balinese style.
	   Kobayashi seems to have freed artistic skills from the
functional element usually attached to traditional art; his
sculpting and engraving techniques are only efforts to attain his
ideas of imaginative forms.

Indonesian students drive through Jakarta in protest convoy With Indonesia-Habibie Interview, Indonesia-Riot Toll

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Standing on bus roofs and hanging out
of car windows, about 1,500 triumphant students who helped oust
President Suharto cruised down Jakarta's main thoroughfare
Wednesday in a rowdy protest against his successor.
	   Shouting ``Hang Suharto,'' they ignored an appeal by Indonesia's
military chief to stop berating the former leader, who faces
growing demands that he surrender riches accumulated during three
decades in power.
	   It was the largest protest since soldiers evicted students
occupying Parliament on May 23, two days after Suharto resigned
amid campus rallies and riots over price increases.
	   Student protesters said Wednesday that Suharto should be tried
for economic crimes and urged the ouster of his successor and
longtime protege, B.J. Habibie. Earlier, in a television interview,
the new president implored Indonesians not to dwell on the
country's corrupt past and to focus on economic recovery.
	   With the economy expected to shrink by at least 10 percent this
year, the task is a daunting one. There are fears that riots may
erupt again as more layoffs and price rises loom.
	   In a report released Wednesday, a government commission said the
death toll from riots in Jakarta last month was 1,188, more than
double an estimate by the military. Many victims were looters
trapped in buildings set afire by arsonists.
	   The National Human Rights Commission also criticized the armed
forces for failing to take prompt action to prevent rioting.
	   Students scoffed at a pledge by Habibie to hold general
elections in 1999, saying he was a corrupt lackey of Suharto and
should step aside. A close ally of Suharto for decades, the new
head of state is bowing to popular demands for democratic reform.
	   ``Reject Habibie,'' chanted the students, who meandered in their
protest caravan from the gates of Parliament to a major downtown
intersection ringed by five-star hotels.
	   Dozens spilled out of the packed vehicles, singing and skipping
around a plaza fountain and waving red and white Indonesian flags
as hotel guests peered from curtained windows.
	   Some students shook the hands of soldiers in berets and
camouflage uniforms who stood by, blocking roads leading to the
city's main square and presidential palace. Some passing
motorcyclists and bus passengers gave thumbs-up signs to the
raucous protesters.
	   Accusations have been building that Suharto aggravated
Indonesia's financial crisis by encouraging his family to build
vast business empires, sapping the state of much of its wealth.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto said the nation of 202 million
people should pardon Suharto because he boosted economic growth and
averted chaos by relinquishing power.
	   ``Lately, condemnation and harassment against the former
president and his family have been exaggerated and, in some cases,
have gotten out of control,'' said Wiranto, a former personal aide
to Suharto.
	   ``The armed forces will take necessary measures to stop it,''
Wiranto said without elaborating.
	   The military is the most powerful institution in Indonesia,
which is beset by uncertainty about its political future. It is
doubtful that Habibie, who has a shaky power base, would make any
policy decisions without the backing of Wiranto.
	   In an interview with Cable News Network that was broadcast
Wednesday, Habibie argued against a painful investigation of
misdeeds that could divide the nation.
	   ``You have unlimited problems in the past. Where are you going
to stop?'' Habibie said. ``So I think it is not worthwhile to dip
into the past. I have to look to the future and create a better
life ... for the people.''
	   In a separate interview with the New York Times, Habibie said
Indonesians should not indulge in ``Wild West'' justice against the
former leader.
	   State prosecutors have launched an inquiry into corruption under
the old government, including complaints that Suharto's family
abused its influence to build huge business empires. However,
critics doubt they will aggressively pursue the former president.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - An average of 2,700 Iraqi children below
the age of five are dying every month due to lack of medicine
following sanctions imposed by the United Nations over the past
eight years.
	   Speaker of the National Assembly of Iraq, Dr Saadoun Hamadi,
said the people were also going through great difficulties and
suffering for no reason following the sanctions.
	   ``I am here to brief leaders of this country on the latest
developments in Iraq and to gain support on the issue of lifting
sanctions against the Iraqi people.
	   ``The 2,700 death figure is not from us but the United Nations
Children Fund agency,'' he said.
	   He said this after calling on Dewan Negara President Tan Sri
Mohamed Yaa'cob at Parliament House today.
	   He said it was time the UN Security Council lifted sanctions
against Iraq as the country's leadership has complied with all
requirements pertaining to the inspection of mass destruction
weapons.
	   The sanctions were prolonged after the Security Council rejected
a report from head of the UN Special Commission Richard Butler
earlier this month.
	   ``We have destroyed our weapons of mass destruction under the
supervision of the Special Commission and complied with all other
requirements.
	   ``It is therefore time the sanctions are lifted,'' he said,
alleging that Butler's report was influenced by the US and Britain.
	   Resolution 687 says that after Iraq has destroyed its mass
destruction weapons, sanctions on its oil exports and other
international commerce should be lifted.
	   ``As we have played our part, it is now the legal requirement of
the commission to carry out the resolution,'' he said.
	   Hamadi said the Security Council was also divided on the issue.
	   ``The United States and Britain are on one side and they are
trying everything to prolong sanctions.
	   ``Other members, Russia, China and France and non-permanent
members in the Security Council, think it is time to implement the
resolution and that Iraq be given the liberty to export oil,'' he
said.
	   Asked why he chose to come to Malaysia, Hamadi said: ``Malaysia
is a friendly country and I came to tell about the misery faced by
the Iraqi people.
	   ``I am also here to find ways to expand our economic and trade
relations,'' he said. Before coming to Malaysia, Hamadi visited
India.

Precede HANOVER At least 60 dead in high-speed German train crash

URGENT

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany after it crashed into an automobile
that had plunged off an overpass onto the tracks. At least 60
people were killed and 200 injured.
	   The Hamburg-bound train struck the auto at 200 kilometers (125
miles) an hour as it approached the station in Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover just before 11 a.m.,
officials said. The train was carrying about 300 passengers.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line inaugurated in 1991, and the most deadly rail crash in Germany
since 1975 when 41 people died in the head-on collision of two
express trains in Bavaria.
	   At least 13 cars derailed, piling into each other and crashing
into the base of the overpass, collapsing it. The force of the
pile-up pushed cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
buried rail cars.
	   Officials said the auto had crashed through the guardrail of the
bridge running over the train tracks.
	   Although it remained unclear, evidence at the scene suggested
that the car struck the train as it passed under the overpass. The
nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while the cars behind
derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

	   CONTINUING its widespread house-cleaning in the wake of
corruption scandals, the Police Department has issued more
disciplinary orders against its black sheep, ranging from division
commanders to police cadets.
	   Police chief Pracha Promnok vowed that one of the biggest purges
in the agency's recent history would continue.
	   ''I know morale is important, but it's more important to save
the whole force,'' said Pracha, who has been under growing
political pressure to stem the tide as new bribery and extortion
scandals keep unfolding.
	   It took two days, Monday and Tuesday, to affect the disciplinary
actions while Central Investigation Bureau commissioner Pol Lt Gen
Seri Temiyavej announced a planned revamp of the Crime Suppression
Division to boost efficiency and stop kickback demands.
	   Police insiders, meanwhile, warn that corruption has become a
deep-rooted problem, eroding the credibility of the law enforcement
agencies. Cadets had to pay kickbacks in order to get into the
force and police officers in turn demanded bribes to enrich
themselves, with wanton disregard to justice, by tampering with
evidence, they said.
	   Pol Gen Pracha Tuesday ordered the transfer of Forensic Science
Region 1 commander Pol Maj Gen Samran Nilubon and Scientific Crime
Detection Division commander Pol Maj Gen Visut Suwansuthi to
inactive posts, citing their failure to maintain proper supervisory
standards over their units.
	   The order came on the heels of Monday's disciplinary action
against two forensic officials, Pol Col Surachai Watcharayothin and
Pol Lt Col Paisal Wongwatsana, on charges of demanding kickbacks
from two business operators in exchange for changing forensic
reports on two fires in a department store and a business premise
in their favour.
	   The tampered reports would rule against arson as the cause of
the fires and facilitate the operators' insurance claims, according
to the disciplinary investigation report on the two officers.
	   Surachai and Paisal, both removed from their active posts, were
under review by the disciplinary committee which would rule on
their penalties.
	   Pracha said in his transfer order that although there was no
hard evidence to link Samran and Visut to the bribery cases
involving their two subordinates, the two commanders have been
shunted out.
	   ''This disciplinary action is absolutely not the last. The
blacklist is still long and our investigation is going on,'' Pracha
said.
	   In another disciplinary action, inspector Pol Maj Theerachai
Haruthaisodsai of Loei's Tha Li police station was dismissed on
charges of negligence for allowing a female drug trafficker to
escape and abuse of power for having sex with the suspect.
	   Heads continue to roll in the wake of the Salween logging
scandal. Pol Maj Gen Pitak Thienthong, former Forestry Police
Division commander, and Pol Maj Gen Chalerm Sanwanangkul, another
former FPD chief, were placed under disciplinary investigation on
charges of accepting kickbacks from poachers.
	   A separate disciplinary investigation was launched to probe
irregularities in the administering of this year's entrance
examination for police cadets. Pol Col Wattana Kritayachote,
instructor at the Police Cadet Academy, Pol Lt Anucha Kotchasenee
of Prachachuen Police Station and two police cadets were charged
with demanding Bt200,000 from each applicant in return for getting
passing grades.
	   Speaking after chairing a meeting with the CSD staff, Seri said
he warned them to shape up and stay away from graft.
	   Although the CSD had not been tainted with corruption scandals,
supervising officers should enforce stricter discipline, he said,
referring to recent reports that a low ranking police official was
involved in drug trafficking and that some CSD policemen had formed
a racket to demand protection money in the South.
	   The CIB commissioner also disclosed that the CSD would soon be
re-structured in order to downsize its areas of jurisdiction. For
example, the CSD's superintendent for region 3 has the jurisdiction
over an area equivalent to the responsibilities of three provincial
police commissioners, he pointed out.
	   Meanwhile, the interior minister's advisory team is sending a
draft on the new police structure to the Council of State to ensure
that major changes proposed do not violate the new Constitution.

	   STATE Railways of Thailand (SRT) employees Tuesday threatened a
mass rally to protest the agency's decision to allow the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration to pay only Bt555 million for the use
of the golf course behind the Chatuchak weekend market.
	   BMA spokesman Mahin Tanbunperm said Communications Minister
Pradit Pataraprasith had already approved the BMA proposal to
transform the SRT golf course into a public park on the occasion of
the King's 72nd birthday next year.
	   Under the contract which will be signed within two weeks, the
land will still belong to the SRT and the BMA will pay Bt555
million in total fees. No time period has been stipulated.
	   SRT State Enterprise Employee Association president Somsak
Kosaisuk said the SRT underestimated the price of the land when it
sought only Bt555 million in fees for the use of 375 rai because
the official assessment values the land at Bt150,000 per square
wah, or Bt20 billion in total.
	   Somsak warned the Communications Ministry not to interfere by
ordering the SRT to sign the deal. He said such an attempt would
violate the SRT Act.
	   He said the act stipulated that land expropriated by the SRT may
be used only to expand SRT operations. SRT land cannot be
transferred to other agencies unless it is to be leased for
commercial or residential purposes.
	   The SRT has been struggling financially and instead of seeking
increased income by raising train fares which would greatly affect
low-income earners, it should seek to raise the land lease fees,
Somsak said.
	   ''We must rally against the plan. The ministry which oversees
SRT must exercise more caution in making decisions which affect the
public. They should be more responsible and have far-sighted
vision,'' he said.
	   Somsak said the BMA has taken advantage of the SRT in leasing
the land for the Chatuchak Weekend Market because it earns over
Bt800 million per year from operating the market but pays the SRT
only Bt10 million for leasing the land.Even though the SRT loses
money every year, it has not raised the rent.
	   Mahin said although the BMA's decision to spend hundreds of
millions of baht on the project at a time of economic difficulties
may be criticised by some members of the public, the city
administration will proceed with the plan because the present BMA
stresses the building of more parks.
	   ''The city residents are in dire need of parks which are like
'city lungs' because they can breathe fresh air and exercise for
their health,'' he said. Mahin said the SRT golf course is most
suitable for becoming a public park because it has large trees,
decorative plants and pools and the BMA needs only to improve the
sidewalks.

	   YOUNG and male workers are the hardest hit by unemployment,
according to the latest labour-market analysis by the government.
	   In previous years, workers aged 40 and above were among the
first to be laid off when employers trimmed down staff.
	   Previously, unemployment was particularly high among female
workers, most of whom were housewives.
	   But the latest labour market situation report prepared by the
Financial Services Bureau reveals a sudden change in the trend.
	   The report, which will be discussed at today's meeting of the
Taskforce on Employment, shows that 63 per cent, or 67,100 of the
106,200 who were jobless during the first quarter, were between 15
to 39.
	   ``Analysed by age, the rise in unemployment initially occurred
among the middle-age and older workers aged 40 and above, but more
recently it spread to younger workers aged 15-19 and 20-29,
particularly those in the distribution and catering trades,'' the
report said.
	   The number of jobless workers in the first quarter aged 40-49
reached only 23,800, almost a third of those between 15 and
39-years old.
	   Those between 50 and above only account for 14 per cent, or
15,400.
	   Unemployment has become much more prominent among males than
females, the report says.
	   About 67 per cent, or 71,400 of the unemployed, are male _ more
than twice the 34,800 unemployed females. The rise in the
unemployment rate was across the board in all major sectors.
	   Sectors showing the most significant slackening were interior
decoration, marketing, on-site construction and retail, restaurants
and hotels.
	   Analysed by educational attainment, the rise in unemployment was
mainly concentrated in workers with secondary education or below,
particularly those with primary education.
	   The report also shows that males have more difficulty going back
to work.
	   Males were more prone to protracted unemployment _ out of work
for 12 months or more.
	   Former manufacturing workers suffered more from protracted
unemployment despite their sector's smaller share of the workforce.
	   Protracted unemployment is much higher for production-related
workers than for managers, administrators and professionals, the
report says.

	   RECOGNISING the importance of social etiquette in their
professions, Universiti Malaya's Women's Association held a two-day
workshop on ``Executive Etiquette Expose'' at Shah's Village Hotel
in Petaling Jaya recently.
	   Fifty-five lecturers and their wives attended the workshop
conducted by L'Ecole des Ingenues director Georgianna Das, a
finishing school in the European teaching tradition.
	   Associatin (UWA) president Dr Norhanom Abdul Wahab said it was
the first workshop to be held on etiquette.
	   She said it was important that the course was organised as in
their line of work they met people daily.
	   ``Some of them follow their husbands to social functions.
Through the course we will know the proper behaviour at such
functions,'' she said.
	   ``For example, we found out today that sitting with leg crossed
is considered rude in our culture although we do not think so.''
	   Norhanom said it was part of the association's annual activity.
	   She added that the course was held to expose members to office
and social etiquette.
	   ``It will help them in boosting their future career undertaking
as well as boost their confidence in their own ability.''
	   Das said the course was organised to enable women to arm
themselves with at least the basic social and business graces in
their daily life.
	   She said knowledge of etiquette could be consider as a
``ticket'' of admission for the women into the conventions of a
polite and caring society that will enable them to relate to others
with polished manners.
	   The two-day workshop was a thorough and extensive preparation
for women.
	   Also present were UWA patron Puan Sri Hashimah Ismail and
L'Ecole des Ingenues founder Ann William.

	   MOST countries surveyed by the Foreign Ministry have agreed to
allow Thai embassies and consulates to be used as polling stations
during the next election, but prohibited campaigning, a senior
Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   Initial surveys indicate that about 850,000 Thai nationals
presently reside overseas, deputy spokesman Karun Ruechuyothin
said. Some countries, including Singapore, have yet to be surveyed.
	   ''Thai nationals who want to cast their ballots in the election
must lodge their intention to vote with the embassy or consular
office in the country in which they are living,'' Karun said. At
present, Thailand has 80 embassies and consular offices overseas.
	   The embassies have asked their host governments whether they
will permit Thai nationals to vote in their countries. Most agreed
that polling can be conducted at the embassies, but said election
campaigning is prohibited by legislation.
	   Karun said Thai citizens who want to vote must present their
household registrations and passports to an embassy.
	   The Foreign Ministry has proposed to the Election Commission
that the ballots be sent to Thailand for counting by diplomatic
pouch and the ministry set up a committee to guarantee neutrality
when sealing and opening the pouches.
	   ''The voting period for Thais abroad will be prior to the
election date in Thailand as it will take time for the embassies to
return the ballots in time for counting on election day,'' Karun
said. Voting in countries with many expatriate Thais, such as in
the United States, will last several days to cope with the expected
demand.
	   The present constitution allows Thai citizens residing abroad to
lodge an absentee vote.
	   The Election Commission is collecting information in preparation
for the next election, particularly regarding absentee voting, as
it will be the first time this kind of voting has been permitted
under the constitution.
	   Karun said the embassies will provide voters with a list of
candidates.
	   The Election Commission will consider the preparation processes
for absentee voting proposed by the Foreign Ministry.

China reports deteriorating environment 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a new report on China's deteriorating
environment, the government warns that water pollution and water
shortages are holding back national economic growth, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The annual report, issued Wednesday, said China's seven major
river systems and its lakes, reservoirs and some underground and
coastal waters are suffering from pollution.
	   Many cities suffer from serious water shortages, it said.
	   ``The shortage of water resources and water pollution have
restricted the country's economic and social development,'' the
report said.
	   Xinhua's account of the report gave few details, but noted that
urban air pollution was getting worse due to the boom in the number
of cars.
	   The State Environmental Protection Administration's report said
the country made ``remarkable achievements'' in cleaning the Huai
River, where the government ordered the shutdown of thousands of
heavily polluting small factories.
	   Xinhua said the report also said the quality and area of arable
land are decreasing, grasslands have been lost to overdevelopment,
and there has been a growth of the improper use of agricultural
chemicals.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Officers from the Attorney-General's
Chambers are scrutinising the investigation papers on former
Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib before
deciding on the next course of action.
	   The Anti-Corruption Agency recently submitted the outcome to one
of the two parts of its investigation to the AG's Chambers.
	   When met outside his office at Bangunan Bank Rakyat in Jalan
Tangsi today, Attorney-General Tan Sri Mohtar Abdullah said: ``I
have personally not seen the papers submitted by the ACA. It is
therefore inappropriate for me to comment on it.''
	   Mohtar declined to specify which part of the investigation was
awaiting further directive from his chambers.
	   The officers would forward their recommendations to Mohtar upon
scrutinising the papers before framing charges, if any, against
Muhammad.
	   Yesterday, ACA director-general Datuk Shafee Yahaya said the
first part of its investigation on Muhammad had been completed and
submitted to the AG's Chambers.
	   Shafee also said investigation into the second part of the
allegation was still on. Its papers would be submitted to the
Attorney-General once the job was done.
	   Although he also declined to elaborate on the two parts of the
ACA investigations, it was reported early last year that the agency
was investigating Muhammad and his two former aides following the
discovery of large amounts of cash in Brisbane and Shah Alam.
	   The ACA started the first investigation following a report
lodged by Pas Youth secretary Mahfuz Omar with the Selangor ACA in
Shah Alam on Dec 29.
	   This came in the wake of an admission by Muhammad that the money
which he failed to declare at the Brisbane airport while enroute to
New Zealand belonged to his three brothers, Datuk Raduan, Datuk
Othman and Hassan.
	   The second investigation was connected to the conversion of a
40-hectare forest area in Bukit Sungai Putih, Hulu Langat involving
Muhammad's former aides.
	   It was reported that the land was gazetted as a forest reserve
in 1972, but the State Executive Council took a decision in 1990 to
degazette it.
	   The land was originally part of the Bukit Sungai Putih forest
reserve and had been earmarked for mixed development after a
logging licence was given to a company.
	   It was reported that the ACA would call all parties involved in
the decision-making to give their statements and this included
Muhammad.
	   One of the two aides was found with about RM1.5 million in his
car when an ACA team from its headquarters in Pesiaran Duta went to
his house in Shah Alam in December 1996.
	   The Brisbane District Court, on Friday, acquitted Muhammad on
two charges of falsely declaring the money he took into Australia
in December 1996 and failing to declare more than AS$1.2 million
(RM2.9 million) when he left the country.

Hamas says it is ready for dialogue with America 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Palestinian group whose suicide
bombers have killed scores of civilians in Israel says it is
prepared to talk to Washington, but only to ``clarify facts'' and
not to take orders.
	   ``We do not close the door in front of any dialogue with the
United States, if it wants this,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, said in remarks published Wednesday by
the Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   He accused the United States of supporting Israel, and warned
that ``we fight our enemy and those who stand by its side.''
	   While there was no chance of talks with Israel, Hamas could
discuss matters with the United States, he was quoted as saying.
	   But the dialogue must be to ``clarify facts and not to receive
orders and dictations,'' he said.
	   Hamas is bitterly opposed to the U.S.-sponsored peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians. It advocates the total
destruction of Israel and claimed responsibility for several
suicide bombings that killed scores of civilians in Israel in
1996-97.
	   ``We are talking with Israel by arms and force until it knows
who is strong (and) right. We will continue to talk to it (Israel)
by this method until we liberate all Palestinian territories and
not part of it,'' he said.
	   Al-Hayat, a leading Arabic-language newspaper published in
London, interviewed Yassin in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the
latest stop on his tour of Muslim countries to win support for
Hamas.
	   Yassin, who is 61-years old and quadriplegic, has so far visited
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Yemen and Syria. He is expected to travel to Pakistan and Malaysia.

Swiss government proposes extra aid for Luxor attack victims 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's government on Wednesday
announced proposals for a special payment to the areas of the
country most affected by last November's massacre of tourists in
the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.
	   The Swiss Foreign Ministry has been ordered to ``continue to
take all useful steps with a view to obtaining financial
compensation from the Egyptian state,'' the Justice Ministry added
in a statement.
	   Thirty-six of the 58 victims of the attack by Islamic militants
on the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor lived in Switzerland, a
country of some 7 million population.
	   The special payment of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.38
million) would help Swiss states with the medical, psychological
and legal assistance, as well as possible compensation claims, of
people affected by the attack, the ministry said.
	   The cantons (states) of Zurich and Lucerne have already asked
for special financial assistance, it added.

	   Top crime-fighter Pol Lt-Gen Seri Temiyavej, thrust into the
forefront of the battle against corruption, has plenty on his
plate. The Nation's Chaiyakorn Bai-ngern takes a look at the man
heading the Central Investigation Bureau.
	   He has been the most sought-after and the busiest man in the
Police Department since the Democrat Party took power last year,
but the question is, will noted crime-buster Pol Lt-Gen Seri
Temiyavej live up to expectations with an increasing number of
arduous tasks assigned to him?
	   Despite his unblemished record, his supporters have begun to
wonder whether Seri will eventually become his own worst enemy.
Critics are asking why only one person has to shoulder so many
responsibilities in a force overflowing with generals.
	   A former communist-fighter whose straightforward manner makes
him unpopular among his colleagues, he was appointed Commissioner
of the Central Investigation Bureau following the formation of the
Chuan government.
	   After he took the post, his first job was to investigate a
bribery scandal in connection with the so-called Salween logging
scandal.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart personally picked Seri to
handle the issue after then Royal Forestry Department
director-general Prawat Thanadkha went to Government House to
donate Bt5 million to the Thai-Help-Thai Fund.
	   The money, Prawat claimed, had been given to him by a logger as
a bribe to cover illegal logging operations in Salween National
Forest.
	   Seri had scarcely finished his first mission when he was ordered
by Sanan to clamp down on illegal activities by influential
figures, mostly with close ties to powerbrokers in the previous
government.
	   A backlash from the Democrat Party's arch rivals was inevitable,
of course, with growing resentment among opposition members
following the crackdown. His move to arrest New Aspiration Party MP
Wichai Chaijitvanij on the last day of the no-confidence debate
against the Chuan administration was seen as the last straw.
Although Wichai was charged with having a smuggled vehicle in his
possession, the opposition vehemently criticised Seri and branded
him ''a government lackey''.
	   But Seri, apparently buoyed by support from the Democrats, did
not yield to the pressure. He came out on the offensive, attacking
the opposition with scathing comments and vowing to dig for more
dirt.
	   Since then, the battle between him and the opposition has seemed
to rage non-stop. Seri went on to uncover a scam in which NAP MP
Premsak Piayura allegedly received Bt1 million in exchange for his
commitment to assist a police officer in the annual transfers.
	   Even though Premsak adamantly denied his involvement in the
scam, he appeared to be the loser. Seri undoubtedly gained the
upper hand. This proved true when the NAP MP discovered that Seri
had used his former personal secretary, Pramual Aimpia, as a key
witness in the allegations.
	   Political observers said that Seri's move had virtually sealed
the fate of the once promising star Premsak, but exasperated by
Seri's shrewd move, the physician turned politician vowed he would
never stop pursuing the top cop.
	   To ease the mounting tension, Seri went away to the United
States for a fortnight. When he came back, however, he was assigned
to investigate the ''black-smoke scandal''.
	   This scam led to the exposure of other bribery scandals,
including allegations that highway police extorted protection money
from truck-drivers.
	   Once again Seri publicly declared war on the police behind the
scam. In the meantime he said forthrightly he faced an uphill
battle because the agencies he was investigating were controlled by
a group of high-ranking officers with close connections to
politicians and influential figures.
	   Despite his overload, Seri still has to perform basic duties,
such as ensuring public security. When iTV television executives
paid a visit to Sanan, asking him to help protect reporters who had
broken the black-smoke scandal, the interior minister also asked
Seri to step up security for the iTV newsmen.
	   Last but not least, Seri was instructed by Sanan to handle cases
involving alleged irregularities by certain executives of failed
finance companies.
	   Seri faces a wide range of different cases from cleaning his own
house to dealing with economic crime. Many critics say only a
miracle could do it.
	   Fighting uphill battles has become the norm for Seri, who was
once mistakenly reported as killed in action during the fight
against communist insurgents. But will he manage to survive this
time?

IFC, USAID sign new contracts in Bosnia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A World Bank sister
organization and the United States Agency for International
development, or USAID, announced Wednesday initiation of several
new investment projects in Bosnia.
	   The International Finance Corporation, or IFC, said it will sign
contracts with local companies to support the private sector in
Bosnia.
	   The contracts are the beginning of a project that will bring a
total of 25 million German marks (dlrs 14.7 million) through loans
and credit lines to the timber industry in both Bosnian substates _
the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Only three years after the end of the war, the Bosnian economy
is already moving ``from reconstruction to growth,'' an IFC press
release said. IFC officials said the time is ripe for international
companies and commercial banks to start investing in Bosnia.
	   IFC, which is part of the World Bank group, is supporting
privatization in undeveloped countries. So far, it has already
invested some 20 million German marks (dlrs 11.7 million) in
Bosnian private companies, financial institutions supporting
privatization and firms expected to be privatized soon.
	   The latest contracts are expected to create 4,500 jobs across
the country.
	   ``Bosnia is a high-risk environment'' after the 3 1/2-year war
that ended in 1995, said Carol F. Lee, IFC vice-president. ``But we
believe that significant progress has been made.''
	   Also Wednesday, USAID announced the signing of contracts worth
dlrs 8.6 million covering projects to reconstruct infrastructure in
several regions across northern Bosnia.
	   They are part of USAID's pledge to invest dlrs 265 million
(450.5 million German Marks) in municipal infrastructure and
services across Bosnia.

	   PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai and his economic ministers were
meeting with former premier Anand Panyarachun and other senior
members of the Thailand Development Research Institute at the
Export-Import Bank headquarters late Tuesday night to discuss the
current economic situation amid renewed regional turbulence.
	   It was the first major congregation of the government's full
economic team, led by Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, and the TDRI, headed
by chairman Anand, president Chalongphob Sussangkarn and former
president Ammar Siamwalla. Former deputy prime minister Virabongsa
Ramangkura was also present.
	   The meeting, which began at 7 am, was said to have been
coordinated by Anand and Tarrin. It took place against a backdrop
of fresh uncertainties in Asia, the local woes highlighted by the
liquidity crunch choking Thai business and mounting social
problems, and trouble plaguing efforts to salvage banking and
finance institutions.
	   A weakening yen, among other factors, has caused sharp
depreciation of the baht against the US dollar since late last
week. The dollar/baht exchange rate ended morning trading at
Bt42.55-Bt42.65, down from Bt40 at the end of last week. The baht
ended the day at Bt42.20 per dollar, a 1.56 per cent drop from
Bt41.55 on Friday.
	   The TDRI has done a macro-economic study which is expected to be
handed over to Chuan today.
	   Meanwhile, state-owned Krung Thai Bank Tuesday submitted to the
Bank of Thailand a plan to recapitalise by a mammoth Bt70 billion
even as signs showed continued deterioration in the country's
economy.
	   Under the Krung Thai plan, a Bt70-billion recapitalisation would
bring the total capital to Bt100 billion.
	   A bank source said the Finance Ministry is expected to borrow
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in order to help KTB
recapitalise.
	   Other details of the plan have not been disclosed yet, including
the new share price. Tuesday, KTB's shares ended 60 satang higher
at Bt5.80.
	   The source said the plan would also help relieve the Financial
Institutions Development Fund's financial burden incurred from
injections into the three nationalised banks -- Siam City Bank,
First Bangkok City Bank, and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
	   US-based JP Morgan is currently studying the three banks to
determine how the government can best handle them.
	   KTB's plan came hot on the heels of signs of renewed regional
financial difficulties, highlighted by the weakening yen. Most
Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday and regional currencies,
including the baht, dipped further.
	   Thai banks and financial institutions, battered by the country's
worst economic crisis, have been forced to raise billions of
dollars in capital from international markets to meet new
provisioning and loan classification rules. Thailand's two largest
banks, Bangkok Bank Plc and Thai Farmers Bank Plc, have already
raised more than Bt70 billion this year.
	   On Friday, Siam Commercial Bank's announcement of a tripling of
its capital through the issue of four billion shares sparked panic
selling on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Fears over the
recapitalisation reduced the bank's stock value by almost 25 per
cent. Analysts attributed the selling spree to the fact that the
stock market was already extremely bearish and the local economic
woes are being compounded by aggravating regional uncertainties.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Chuan said the impact of the ''second regional
crisis'' was still ''manageable''. But he admitted the government
was concerned about its plan to issue global bonds, an essential
part of the scheme to save the banking sector and bring back
liquidity.

	   JAKARTA (JP): An education exhibition at the Jakarta Convention
Center from May 7 to May 11 saw a fairly good representation from
the Netherlands, with about nine universities and higher
professional education institutes present.
	   The Netherlands is one of the less favored destinations of
Indonesian students seeking education abroad, with only 400
Indonesians currently studying there.
	   In comparison, the United States has 15,000 Indonesian students,
followed by Australia with 14,000. Some 2,000 are studying in
Britain and 1,100 in Japan.
	   The Netherlands clearly has more promotion do, as reflected in
the Educational, Training and Technology Exhibition.
	   Despite the crisis, according to organizers, the event was
visited by 200,000 students, although the number of students who
actually committed themselves to studying at the promoted
institutions was not clear.
	   The Dutch language is not the main reason why the number of
students going to the Netherlands is much lower than other
countries.
	   The Netherlands offers more English programs than most European
countries.
	   The possibilities of going to the Netherlands with a scholarship
is at a bottle-neck for students here because offers are very
limited.
	   Germany is now offering 300 scholarships.
	   Some private organizations, including the Dutch Language Union,
Netherlands Education Center (NEC) and Forum Nederland Indonesia
(FNI), have been encouraging businesses to offer possibilities for
students to study in the Netherlands.
	   Before 1992, the Dutch government offered 600 scholarships for
Indonesian students to study in the Netherlands.
	   But political strains put an end to this in 1992, mainly because
of the perceived interference of the Netherlands in domestic
affairs regarding human rights. The Netherlands then chaired the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia.
	   But such strains did not inhibit business between the two
countries. A few years ago, some private organizations took the
initiative to restart possibilities for scholarships.
	   Among them was the Dutch Language Union, a private organization
promoting study of the Dutch language in other countries.
	   ``At the moment the Dutch Language Union offers 16 students of
the Dutch language and literature a scholarship to go to the
Netherlands or Belgium (the Dutch speaking part) for three weeks,''
said Kees Groeneboer, academic consultant of the Dutch Department
of the University of Indonesia.
	   Henk Mahendra said he was one student who benefited from a
scholarship. He studied economic agriculture in Wageningen for
seven years.
	   Since 1995, the NEC has tried to expand possibilities. It is an
independent and nonprofit organization promoting academic
cooperation and mobility between Indonesia and the Netherlands.
	   ``We want to stimulate Indonesian students to go to the
Netherlands for an international study or internship to upgrade
their education level and practical experience,'' said Jon Hagen,
director of NEC.
	   However, tickets and living costs are still paid by students.
	   Since the economic crisis, a few companies related to the NEC
decided to support students going to the Netherlands by offering
more scholarships.
	   The NEC has also started thinking about offering scholarships.
They have started developing a program for postgraduate students in
a wide scale of subjects for a study period of three months to 18
months.
	   Another assisting organization is FNI. Graduates with two years
work experience and a good knowledge of English (minimum of 475
points in the test of English as a foreign language), can be sent
to the Netherlands through FNI.
	   ``Since 1995, we have sent about 100 Indonesians to the
Netherlands on internships or a combination of study and
internship,'' said Suni Sudradjat, FNI's project manager.
	   Under an invitation from a Dutch company, scholarships can be
arranged through a private organization for entrepreneurs
(VNO/NCF).
	   At the exhibition, promoters of the Netherlands counters said
some 400 Indonesian students asked for further information about
studying in the Netherlands.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Malaysia Airlines' insistence that
airfreight forwarders sign the bonded warehouse tenancy agreement
while the disputed rental tariff at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport is unresolved has put many in a bind.
	   Sensing that their pleas to MAS for a ``fair'' rental tariff has
fallen on deaf ears, the Airfreight Forwarders Association of
Malaysia has called on the Government to intervene.
	   AFAM claimed MAS, one of the two appointed ground-handling
agents, had issued airfreight forwarders the ultimatum last Monday
to sign or risk having the warehouse offered to other parties.
	   AFAM chairman Walter Culas said their members, who had each paid
a deposit of RM5,000, were caught in a predicament.
	   ``Our members are being forced to sign the tenancy agreement
without just cause. There is still time to negotiate and resolve
the matter as the warehouses (will be) ready only in mid-June.''
	   ``AFAM members are prepared to accept the tenancy agreement on
fair terms, and move into the warehouses within two days upon
signing, provided all the basic amenities like telecommunications
and data lines and utilities are made available,'' he said.
	   At its extraordinary general meeting last May 20, AFAM's 157
members unanimously endorsed the association's recommendations,
including the concern of insufficient and sub-international
standard warehouses.
	   MAS is making available 68 bonded warehouses at KLIA, while the
other agent, Kuala Lumpur Airport Services Sdn Bhd, is offering 27.
	   Culas said that AFAM was contemplating obtaining a court
injuction to seek legal redress should there be no progress to
their pleas.
	   He claimed that the majority of the 69 affected AFAM members
were foreign-based multinational companies who appeared to be
caught in a tight situation by MAS' ultimatum.
	   Under the rental tariff of RM5.25 per square foot offered by
MAS, the airfreight forwarders have to pay a minimum sum of about
RM19,000 a month.
	   The rate is an increase of 429 per cent compared with the RM1.25
per square foot tariff at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International
Airport in Subang.
	   Based on a survey of 133 AFAM members, Culas said the projected
monthly expenses to be incurred at KLIA would amount to RM4.538
million compared with RM1.056 million in Subang.
	   On a dollar-to-dollar basis, the offered rates at Sepang are the
highest in the world, compared with Singapore (S$2.78 per sq ft)
and New York (US$1.88 per sq ft).
	   ``This will drastically increase the operating costs at Sepang,
forcing airfreight forwarders to either absorb it or pass it on to
consumers.
	   Should this happen, KLIA's competitiveness against other
regional hubs will be decreased, not to mention its impact on
inflation and loss of foreign revenue,'' said Culas.

	   THE government Tuesday backed down from pushing ahead with the
Chanthaburi international airport project, resolving to put it on
hold for a few years.
	   Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban Tuesday asked the
Cabinet to go back from its earlier resolution to allocate Bt116
million from the 1999 fiscal year for the project.
	   But the provincial councils of Chanthaburi and Trat vowed
Tuesday to campaign against the Cabinet's decision.
	   Suthep said he decided to put the project on hold to heed public
criticism.
	   ''With respect to opinions of the public and the mass media,
I've decided to delay the project because we don't have money for
it,'' Suthep said before attending the Cabinet meeting.
	   ''We don't want this trivial issue to escalate into a national
conflict.'' Suthep said he made the decision on Monday night after
consulting Deputy Communications Minister Pradit Pataraprasith and
listening to a briefing by the Civil Aviation Department.
	   Earlier, Suthep and several other Democrat Cabinet members,
including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai himself, had come out
strongly to defend the project following much criticism. The
Democrats said the Chanthaburi airport was necessary for the
development of the eastern coast as well as for promoting tourism.
	   The project came to light after the Social Action Party
questioned why the government had allocated Bt116 million from the
additional Bt25 billion of the 1999 fiscal year budget for the
airport's construction and would not grant the SAP more money for
providing health care to the public.
	   Chuan earlier asked the Finance Ministry to allocate an
additional of Bt400 million to the Public Health Ministry, which is
under the SAP's supervision, but insisted on going ahead with the
Chanthaburi project.
	   Suthep said he had been monitoring public opinion on the issue
and had asked Pradit and the Civil Aviation Department to brief him
on the background of the project.
	   ''In short, the project was initiated in 1995 and some money had
been granted for environment study, land expropriation and
design,'' Suthep said.
	   He said he was briefed by a deputy director general of the Civil
Aviation Department that the location of the airport would be 40
kilometres away from Chanthaburi, 26 km from Trat and 200 km from
U-tapao navy airport in Chonburi.
	   Suthep said the Civil Aviation Department pointed out that the
airport would be useful to develop tourism in the eastern provinces
and would facilitate food exports.
	   ''I assessed the situation and decided that the country was
having a lot of problems so we should not add one more with a
non-issue. It will not be too late to wait until the economy
improves and the government has more money,'' Suthep said.
	   Suthep said the Bt116 million would be turned back to the
central fund for financing other urgent projects.
	   Pradit said the project might have to be delayed until 2000 or
2001 and would be revived only after the economy recovers.
	   The Cabinet decided to delay the project although a group of
Chanthaburi businessmen visited Government House earlier in the
morning to submit a letter in support of the airport's
construction. The businessmen included Banyong Netsamarn, chairman
of the Chanthaburi Chamber of Commerce, Pracha Pongsopha, chairman
of Chanthaburi's industrial council and Wichai Wannapong, president
of Chanthaburi's tourism association.
	   They wanted to meet Chuan but the prime minister did not receive
them, hencethe letter was received by Suthep, who explained to them
that the project had been put on hold.
	   Though accepting the decision, Pracha said the project would
benefit the country because foreign investors had expressed a lot
of interest in it.
	   The two provincial councils resolved that they would meet Suthep
and opposition leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh tomorrow to ask them to
push for the project.

Swiss government proposes extra aid for Luxor attack victims

RETRANSMITTING to fix category code
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's government on Wednesday
announced proposals for a special payment to the areas of the
country most affected by last November's massacre of tourists in
the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.
	   The Swiss Foreign Ministry has been ordered to ``continue to
take all useful steps with a view to obtaining financial
compensation from the Egyptian state,'' the Justice Ministry added
in a statement.
	   Thirty-six of the 58 victims of the attack by Islamic militants
on the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor lived in Switzerland, a
country of some 7 million population.
	   The special payment of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.38
million) would help Swiss states with the medical, psychological
and legal assistance, as well as possible compensation claims, of
people affected by the attack, the ministry said.
	   The cantons (states) of Zurich and Lucerne have already asked
for special financial assistance, it added.

	   The tobacco industry has been thrown off balance by a stringent
new advertising code released by ASCI It had to happen. The tobacco
industry saw it coming for a long time. India's anti-tobacco lobby
had been gaining momentum, propelled mainly by consumer bodies and
health workers. After 18 months of deliberation, the Advertising
Standards Council of India (ASCI) last fortnight released a tough
new set of guidelines for tobacco advertising that will come into
effect from 1 October.
	   Even as ad agencies and tobacco companies frown over the code,
consumer activists are peeved that the restrictions don't go far
enough. ``We need a code that can bite, not just bark,'' says
consumer activist and lawyer Shirish Deshpande. But then, as Bharat
Patel, vice-chairman of ASCI (also chairman and managing director,
Proctor  Gamble) says, ``We simply cannot please everybody.''
	   In short, ASCI says that ads may not suggest that tobacco
products lead to health, safety, success (in business,
relationships, sports, sex), machismo, daring, courage,
emancipation, testimonials from well-known personalities or heroes
of the young. There's more: people featured in ads should ``clearly
appear to be over 25 years of age'', no more than a third of
persons featured shall be shown smoking, no tobacco ads may be
released in media targeting children.... Where does this leave
advertisers of tobacco products? More important, do they really
have to comply with this code, especially since ASCI has no
statutory powers?
	   The industry's biggest player, ITC, says that it will comply but
not overnight. It is quite clear that all the smaller companies are
waiting to see how ITC reacts to the code. Not surprising, given
that ITC is estimated to have a market share of about 67 per cent.
Its ad budget, Rs173 crore last year, is estimated to account for
over 67 per cent of all cigarette advertising. Already exposed to
BAT's stringent code after its tie-up to produce and market Benson
 Hedges (BH) and 555 State Express, ITC has already begun to
revamp its advertising pitches.
	   Godfrey Phillips, which has a share of about 13 per cent of the
market, declined to comment on the implications of the code while
it is being studied by its legal department. With brands like
Panama and Chancellor, GTC Ltd, with an ad budget of Rs19 crore,
says it will try to comply, though total compliance will take a
couple of years, and even then only ``if legislation is passed''.
But, insists Ved Berry, marketing director, GTC, ``It is a
voluntary code and cannot be enforced. `` The company has just 6
per cent of the cigarette market and is currently a BIFR case. VST,
with 13 per cent of the market and an adspend of Rs15 crore, will
be less affected. It has typically favoured more subdued
advertising.
	   A will, and many ways Tobacco monies keep virtually every ad
agency in Calcutta in business. BatesClarion, for instance. Apart
from ITC's Gold Flake account, the agency also handles new entrants
BH and 555 (Bates' accounts internationally). BH and 555 ads are
not expected to run afoul of ASCI as they are already designed to
pass the UK's code, which is even more stringent. ASCI's own
standards are based on the UK's code.
	   A number of current campaigns are now going to be no-nos. Like
the one that features actor Akshay Kumar in a daring rescue of
damsels trapped in a cable car between puffs of his Red  White
cigarette. Out go macho ads like Vinod Khanna and his Baba Zarda or
the recent Wills clip showing four youngsters discovering the Wills
logo in a cliff amidst Aztec ruins. Philip Morris' Malboro man, in
the wings for some time now, may never enter the Indian market in
its current avatar.
	   Where tobacco companies are expected to dig their heels is in
their sponsorship of events. Already, an Indian court has ruled
that the mere display of a logo does not constitute advertising and
ASCI has reiterated this. ``Our standards have to stay within what
is legally permissible,'' says Patel. ``As long as the law permits
it, we will.'' The European Commission failed to ban sponsorship of
events by tobacco companies when it appeared that Formula One motor
racing and the World Rally Championship would collapse completely.
	   ITC has emerged as the biggest sponsor of sporting events in
India over the last decade. These include the Wills World Cup in
cricket and Classic's links with equestrian events and golf, Gold
Flake in tennis and billiards, and Bristol in football. What of
ITC's investment in sponsoring tennis stars Leander Paes and Mahesh
Bhupathi? Interestingly, Sam Balsara, chief executive, Madison
Advertising, and a member of ASCI's board of governors, says this
campaign is also a clear no-no, even if it does not exhort viewers
to actually smoke the brand.
	   Despite the ban on surrogate advertising, other smokescreens
will pass, simply because they do not contravene the letter of
ASCI's code. On sale soon will be Jack Nicklaus golf clubs from
Classic and footballs from Bristol. Wills has long marketed books,
diaries, videos, clothes etc. If such merchandise is produced and
sold in large numbers, ASKI says it's fine. ITC's vice-president
Kurush Grant maintains that the Wills brand is being advertised
rather than the cigarettes in most advertising material. What will
ASCI do if tobacco companies simply decide that they do not want to
comply with its code? At stake is about Rs257 crore from cigarette
advertisers alone. Dorab Sopariwala, chairman of ASCI, explains
that 80-90 per cent of the press media are ASCI members and most
often they would choose to abide by ASCI's suggestions and reject
ads that go against its rules. All major TV networks are ASCI
members. Even though channels like Star and Zee are beamed from
outside the country, they are subject to the standards and
practices of Hong Kong, from where they are beamed. A look at Hong
Kong's code is telling, it even specifies that merchandise like
cigarette holders, tobacco filters, etc, cannot be broadcast ``in
proximity to children's programmes''. Moreover, says Sainath Iyer,
Zee TV's vice-president, marketing services: ``We also follow all
Indian rules and regulations.''
	   ``Ninety-nine per cent of the time we would reject an ad that
offends ASCI's codes,'' admits the marketing director of a
publishing house a little wistfully. ``True, we have no statutory
authority but our members realise that if we don't regulate
ourselves, somebody will regulate us,'' says Sopariwala. The
rationale has worked so far, and ASCI has never really faced any
major problems about compliance from its own members, but if the
tobacco industry took a tough stand, the issue may well be the
first real test of ASKI's mettle. Balsara admits that there have
been problems with liquor advertisers, but ASCI expects tobacco
companies to be more responsive.
	   Despite ASCI's best attempts, there is plenty of scope for
discretionary interpretation under the new code. Obviously, its
complaints cell is in for a great deal of hair-splitting with
tobacco companies and anti-tobacco lobbies interpreting the code
completely differently. But then, says Sopariwala, you simply
cannot write the definitive code; ``it is also open to change.''
	   Patel agrees that the most problems with compliance will come
not from cigarette companies, but from small-time manufacturers of
beedis, gutkha, zarda, kiwam, ghadaka, hand-rolled and chewing
tobacco. Unlike the cigarettewallahs, such manufacturers did not
even respond to ASCI's proposal to discuss formulating the code.
ITC chairman Yogi Deveshwar has been at pains to point out that
cigarette smokers only consume about 20 per cent of the nation's
tobacco. He feels that picking on companies like ITC would be
counterproductive and would drive consumption underground.
	   So who will the government side with on the issue? A tricky
question. Even as a number of states have introduced no-smoking
laws for public places, the government has a healthy respect for
the fact that tobacco sales account for about 10 per cent of excise
collections (with cigarette sales alone contributing 90 per cent of
this amount), which are more than Rs4,500 crore. The next few
months promise to be interesting, for they will test the ingenuity
of ad agencies, the PR of tobacco companies, the ethical
compulsions of the media and the vigilance of the anti-tobacco
lobby.

	   A TIME TO KILL (US, 1996, LD, Dolby Surround) Directed by Joel
Schumacher Starring Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra
Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, Ashley
Judd Running time: 150 minutes Rating: (Not suitable for children)
THE themes explored in this gripping yet flawed drama about race
set in the American South will remind you a bit too much of
Mississippi Burning.
	   But, despite being somewhat glib and unoriginal, the screen
interpretation of John Grisham's book has enough going for it to
keep you watching to the end.
	   Maybe it is director Joel Schumacher's flair for visual pacing;
whatever it is, it certainly helps to make an otherwise ordinary
movie more interesting than it really should be.
	   A black teenage girl is brutally raped by two white men.
Distrusting the justice system, her enraged father Carl Lee Hailey
(Samuel L. Jackson) guns them down and is charged with murder.
	   Carl chooses the relatively inexperienced Jake Brigance (Matthew
McConaughey) to defend him in court.
	   The trial inflames racial passions, and the local Ku Klux Klan
soon starts attacking those helping to free Carl, including Jake
and his family.
	   In the midst of all this trouble, Jake struggles to put up a
strong defence with help from his old law school professor (Donald
Sutherland) and an assertive lawyer (Sandra Bullock).
	   So does justice prevail in a seemingly white-controlled
courtroom?
	   The latter part of the film is devoted to resolving that; it's
probably the most compelling segment of the movie. The other
events, like the KKK attacks, seem like they're there more to boost
the action than to intensify the drama.
	   The cast does a fairly good job, especially McConaughey and
Jackson. But the film is not very convincing in its sense of time
and place.
	   TEX (US, 1982, LD) Directed by Tim Hunter Starring Matt Dillon,
Jim Metzler, Meg Tilly, Bill McKinney, Ben Johnson, Emilio Estevez
Running time: 103 minutes Rating: (Not suitable for children)
BEFORE this teen angst vehicle, Disney wouldn't associate itself
with any production that hinted at young rebellion, so Tex is worth
watching if only for that.
	   But of course, being a screen adaptation of an S.E. Hinton
novel, it has more to offer, especially in Matt Dillon's persuasive
characterisation of a curious and confused 15-year-old Oklahoma
farm boy discovering the real meaning of life.
	   Tex McCormick does not have the ideal home. His mom is dead, his
dad's a rodeo drifter. He has only his older brother Mason (Jim
Metzler) taking care of him.
	   Like all searching and troubled teenagers, Tex goes through the
rituals of rebellious behaviour but soon learns how harsh the real
world can be.
	   This is an intriguing coming-of-age tale that, despite trying to
cram in too many themes - crime, love, sex, death - works rather
well.
	   It may have a dated feel to it, but the film's almost cinema
verite style makes for some absorbing moments.
	   TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR (US, 1995, LD,
Dolby Surround) Directed by Beeban Kidron Starring Patrick Swayze,
Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo, Ru Paul, Robin Williams, Julie
Newmar, Chris Penn Running time: 108 minutes Rating: (Not suitable
for children) IT may not be a laugh a minute, but this drag-queen
road movie has some deliciously hilarious scenes. The story is
silly, of course, but that makes it even more engaging! Three New
York drag queens - Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze), Noxeema Jackson
(Wesley Snipes) and Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) -have just
cashed in their chips and are on their way to Hollywood in a
Cadillac.
	   But along the way, they run into a homophobic smalltown sheriff
(Chris Penn) who swears revenge after being knocked out by Vida.
Then their car breaks down in a small town in the Midwest and the
queens are faced with the challenge of convincing the conservative
townsfolk that they're cool.
	   During the three days they are there, the ``ladies'' teach the
residents to really let their hair down. Pretty soon, everyone is
jiving and the poor sheriff with the axe to grind finds himself in
a no-win situation.
	   What a fabulously fatuous film this is, with the entire cast
really hamming it up as befits the asinine humour! You'll be
disappointed only if you're expecting brainy gags.
	   MALONE (US, 1987, LD, Dolby Surround) Directed by Harley Cokliss
Starring Burt Reynolds, Cliff Robertson, Lauren Hutton, Cynthia
Gibb, Scott Wilson.
	   Running time: 92 minutes Rating: and a half (Not suitable for
children) BURT Reynolds is in confident form here as a former CIA
hitman trying to turn over a new leaf. After abandoning his last
hit, Richard Malone takes off to Oregon. But trouble with his car
forces him to stay in a small town under the control of
megalomaniac developer Charles Delany (Cliff Robertson).
	   When Delany threatens the lives of his hosts, service station
owner Paul Barlow (Scott Wilson) and his pretty daughter Jo
(Cynthia Gibb), Malone has no choice but to confront the murderous
warlord. The film may not amount to much, but it does offer some
exciting action scenes.
	   SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS (US/UK, 1989,
LD, Dolby Surround) Directed by Paul Bartel Starring Jacqueline
Bisset, Ray Sharkey, Robert Beltran, Mary Woronov, Ed Bagley Jr.,
Wallace Shawn Running time: 103 minutes Rating: (Not suitable for
children) SEX And Debauchery In Beverly Hills would be a more
accurate title for this farce. It's meant as a satire, but plays
more like a sitcom straining for humour.
	   Divorcee Lisabeth Hepburn-Saravian (Mary Woronov) comes to stay
over the weekend at the mansion of her neighbour, out-of-work and
widowed TV star Clare Lipkin, while having her house fumigated.
	   Also there are Lisabeth's playwright brother (Ed Bagley Jr.) and
his new black wife, her ex (Wallace Stevens), Clare's daughter and
a stud of a male houseguest.
	   Before the weekend is out, everybody, including the South
American maid and the butler, has slept with everybody else, and in
a morbid and bizarre twist, Clare's late husband (Paul Mazursky)
returns from the dead to make a play for her.
	   It's a pointless ``Struggle'', and only a few will be amused.

	   SOMPRASONG doesn't care whether someone watches her taking a
shower naked, but the public cried foul after seeing a picture of
Somprasong and other homeless women at a Public Welfare
Department's rehabilitation centre lining up naked in front of a
shower house.
	   ''They asked me to take a shower, and I just did it without
thinking too much. If someone likes to watch, let them. They can't
take anything away from me,'' Somprasong told a TV station after
the picture was splashed on Matichon's front page Tuesday.
	   For all Somprasong said no one could take anything away from
her, the Law Society of Thailand has deemed that her human dignity
was taken away by the ''inhumane'' treatment of the public-welfare
officials at the centre.
	   The picture clearly demonstrated that the homeless women had
stripped before they were paraded from their living quarters to the
shower house. Although a concrete fence surrounds the centre, what
happens inside the shower house can be clearly seen over the fence
from higher buildings around the centre.
	   Public Welfare Director Gen Irawat Chantharaprasert and Wipa
Anothit, chief of the centre, did not deny that the women had been
ordered to strip.
	   But they argued that more than half of the 720 homeless women at
the centre were insane and so needed ''special care'' from the
officials.
	   ''During the past few days the weather has been very hot, so
these women stripped to rush and take a shower, and the officials
were not able to control them,'' he claimed.
	   Wipa said the people who climbed over the fence to see the women
should be ashamed of themselves.
	   ''These women are homeless people and beggars. Some have skin
diseases and need to be taken care of by the officials,'' he said.
	   But Sak Korsaengruang, president of the Law Society of Thailand,
said insanity or being a beggar could not be cited to force women
to walk naked in public.
	   ''The picture clearly shows that the government agency treated
underprivileged people without due care to their human dignity as
required by the Constitution,'' Sak said. ''This is a clear
violation of the human rights of the women at the centre.''
Dej-udom Krairit, a member of the Law Society, condemned the centre
for its''uncivilised'' treatment of the women. He said his group
would fight for the pride and dignity of the women in all
public-welfare centres.

	   HEALTH authorities may ask Hong Kong importers of fizzy drinks
to withdraw their merchandise following the recall of millions of
cans of drinks in Britain over a toxic-gas scare.
	   On Monday, traces of benzene, a chemical which causes cancer,
was found in supplies of carbon dioxide used to make drinks fizzy.
Cadbury Schweppes Plc recalled about one million litres of bottled
Malvern sparkling water in Britain after discovering tainted
samples.
	   A spokesman for Hong Kong's Department of Health said yesterday
an inspection of Hong Kong shelves found the Malvern sparking water
on sale but said the Malvern batch was manufactured in April and
was not part of the May-manufactured products contaminated in the
UK.
	   Technical manager Robert Pease said Malvern sparkling water was
not sold in Hong Kong.
	   Other contaminated brands such as Pepsi Max, Pepsi Diet and
Seven-Up were not sold in Hong Kong, the spokesman said.
	   But for safety's sake the department would request the importers
of the fuzzy drinks to withdraw the merchandise, the spokesman
said. Details on the withdrawal will be discussed with the
manufacturers.
	   Cadbury Beverages Asia claimed local products were not affected
by the recall.
	   Cadbury's products are bottled locally by Swire Coca Cola Hong
Kong. A spokesperson for the company said the contamination in
Britain was an ``isolated case'' due to the problems with the
carbon dioxide supplied to make the drinks fizzy. About 10 million
litres of Malvern sparkling bottled water is sold every year. About
one million litres, or eight weeks' stock, has been withdrawn from
sale.
	   In 1990, Perrier withdrew 160 million bottles of its water
worldwide at a cost of 150 million after US scientists found traces
of benzene in 13 bottles of water.
	   Smith Kline Beecham, makers of Lucozade and Ribena, said it had
ceased distribution of benzene-affected products and was testing
samples before deciding whether to order a recall. A spokeswoman
for the London office said the amounts of benzene in the products
were not a health risk, but a ``quality issue''. The Hong Kong
office said Ribena available here was not imported from Britain,
although Lucozade was.

EU contributes dlrs 5.5 million to Bosnian elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union cleared a further
dlrs 5.5 million Wednesday in support of upcoming Bosnian elections
in September.
	   The latest package brings to dlrs 14.2 million the total amount
of funds earmarked by the EU over the past two years for Bosnia's
upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.
	   The money will help finance the work of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe in Bosnia. The OSCE is
responsible for monitoring the September polls.
	   ``It is essential to have a genuine, transparent and fair
democratic process before, during and after the election date,''
said Hans Van den Broek, the EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in
a statement. ``International involvement is crucial in achieving
this goal.''
	   EU foreign ministers approved the latest package in April.
	   The EU funds will support the work of OSCE supervision
personnel, of international supervisors and trainers, registration
assistants and polling supervisors, a statement said.
	   The EU is also backing the establishment of a media centre to
``help the media more effectively gather information and contribute
to public debate'' in Bosnia, the statement said.

	   PENANG, Mon. - Malaysia must eliminate all sources of
pestiferous flies in its fresh fruit commodities to boost exports
of these items to quarantine- sensitive countries.
	   Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud today called
for efforts to be taken in eliminating fruit flies which had been
identified as a major obstacle to the development of the fruit and
horticulture industries in Malaysia and the region.
	   ``Besides causing significant losses in production, the flies
also restrict free trade and exports of fresh fruit commodities
between many countries.
	   ``Malaysian fruits cannot be freely exported to markets like the
United States, Japan, Australia or New Zealand because strict
quarantine regulations in these countries prohibit entry of fresh
fruits unless expensive disinfestation treatments are carried
out,'' he said when opening the Fifth International Symposium on
Fruit Flies of Economic Importance at the Penang Parkroyal Resort.
	   ``Our efforts to enhance the cultivation of fruits are not
spared the ravages of pests, fruit flies in particular.
	   ``Judging from the severity of damage to important money-earning
crops like carambola (starfruit), mango and guava which can suffer
100 per cent damage if not protected, economic losses are estimated
to run into several million ringgit annually,'' Dr Sulaiman added.
	   The five-day symposium which ends on Friday is being attended by
nearly 200 participants from 45 countries.
	   The symposium is organised by Universiti Sains Malaysia, the
International Fruit Fly Steering Committee and the Working Group on
Malaysian Fruit Flies.
	   Also present today were USM vice-chancellor Professor Datuk
Ishak Tambi Kechik, International Fruit Fly Steering Committee
chairman Dr Patrick J.
	   Gomes and the event's organising committee chairman Dr Tan Keng
Hong.
	   In his welcoming address, Gomes said global thinking and action
were needed to disseminate information on fruit flies to
agricultural producers and consumers.
	   ``Although world trade is expanding at a rapid rate, the mere
presence of certain fruit fly species prevents the movement of
fresh commodities from one country to another.
	   ``Recent assessments on the economic and social impacts of
certain fruit flies reveal that losses, direct and indirect, easily
amount to millions of ringgit each year,'' he said.
	   ``Although the Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated
losses of US$60 million (RM228 million) caused by fruit flies in
the Mediterranean region in 1995, a study conducted in Israel,
Jordan and countries in the region revealed US$192 million in
losses.

	   THERE were no exchange of pleasantries. Not even a nod of
recognition. Only a hard, cold stare as murder suspect Serm
Sakhonrat kept his eyes transfixed on prosecutor's witness Niran
Sahassukmankong as he took the witness stand Tuesday.
	   Serm and Niran, who have professed competing claims to be the
''real'' boyfriend of murder victim Jenjira Ploy-angunsri,
confronted each other for the first time since the police discovery
of their sweetheart's death.
	   In an hour-long trial session, Niran stole a few nervous glances
at the confessed killer who later retracted his statements in
court.
	   Niran, an engineer at the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand, seemed to express his disbelief that the nerdy-looking,
second-year medical student could shatter their love for the same
girl in a macabre way.
	   According to forensic evidence and Serm's statements, the
defendant was charged with shooting Jenjira in January and later
trying to get rid of the evidence by cutting up her body and
flushing the pieces down the toilet and dumping the skeleton into
the Bang Pakong River.
	   Although Serm produced a series of confessions about how he
executed the killing and the subsequent cover-up of evidence
following his arrest in March, he had never retracted on his motive
-- that of a broken heart, investigators said.
	   In eyeing Niran's every movement, Serm seemed to show his
bewilderment at the fact that the witness could really be the man
who stole his sweetheart's heart.
	   Throughout their confrontation, the defendant only diverted his
eyes once to the empty walls when Niran answered a prosecutor's
question saying that Jenjira confided in him that she did not love
Serm.
	   Speaking from the witness stand, Niran informed the presiding
judge that he was no stranger to Jenjira and her family. He and the
murder victim grew up in the same neighbourhood. They went to the
same high school where his sister was a classmate of Jenjira.
	   After a series of social meetings, the witness said he and
Jenjira recognised that their friendship had blossomed into love
after a New Year date during which they saw the romantic movie
''Titanic'' together.
	   Since then, they were almost inseparable, having dinner three
times a week and exchanging beeper messages several times daily.
	   They even turned their beepers to the vibration mode and kept
them in their shirt pockets so that the machines would stroke their
hearts every time they exchanged messages.
	   Serm's eyes only glowered in agony during the witness'
testimony.
	   Prior to Jenjira's disappearance, the murder victim had
increasingly complained about being stalked by a male friend whom
she did not love. In fact Niran paged her on the very day she was
allegedly killed, the witness said.
	   Under cross-examination by the defence lawyer, the witness
clarified that Jenjira had never mentioned Serm by name as the man
who tried to win her heart, and that he was unaware whether Jenjira
discussed him with Serm.
	   Defence counsel Sit Kanwat tactfully asked the witness whether
he knew that he was on the list of people suspected to have caused
Jenjira's disappearance, and was possibly trying to raise doubts by
accusing Serm as the only suspect.
	   The Criminal Court set June 9 for further trial.

	   RECREATIONAL facilities managed by the Urban Services Department
will be provided free of charge on 1 July to mark the first
anniversary of the handover.
	   A motion to waive all charges for swimming pools, indoor sports
facilities and other leisure services on 1 July was proposed by
Provisional Urban Council member Peter Wong Man-chiu yesterday.
	   He said the government would lose about $700,000, but added: ``I
think the money that the council will lose can be compensated in
various ways.
	   ``By offering services free of charge to the public, Hong Kong
people who are now suffering greatly from the present economic
downturn can have the opportunity to enjoy our services.
	   ``At the same time, we will all be able to celebrate our 1 July
anniversary together,'' he said.
	   Vice-chairman Ip Kwok-chung, who supported the motion, said the
council would be criticised if it were to reject the proposal.
	   ``I heard that the Provisional Regional Council had passed more
or less a similar motion earlier,'' Mr Ip said.
	   ``If we vote against it, we will be criticised again _ this time
for the discrepancies in the policies of the two councils.'' There
were some dissenting voices.
	   ``I think we should decide which day is important and which day
is not,'' Kam Nai-wai said. ``We cannot always ask for a free open
day by saying that such and such day is important, especially when
we are now under a very tight budget.'' The motion was passed with
28 councillors voting for it, 10 against and two abstentions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A pilgrimage organiser told the Sessions
Court today that a businessman charged RM300 for each visa
allegedly issued by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Jakarta for
Malaysian pilgrims to perform their haj in Mecca.
	   Syed Ahmad Syed Husin, 43, said he met the businessman Wan
Hassan Noor twice in 1993 at the Merdeka Hotel and Asia Hotel to
hand over the passports belonging to the pilgrims, including his
own.
	   He was giving evidence at the trial of Wan Hassan, charged with
two counts of cheating. Religious teacher Roroh Saleh    Abdullah
Saleh is charged with abetting him and forging visa stamps and
signatures on 94 passports.
	   Wan Hassan, 43, is alleged to have deceived a company manager,
identified only as Bahrin, through Syed Ahmad, into believing he
(Wan Hassan) was in a position to obtain 94 visas from the Saudi
Arabian embassy in Indonesia.
	   The offence was allegedly committed between April 10 and May 3,
1993 at the Merdeka Hotel, 44 Jalan Hj Hussein.
	   Wan Hassan also claimed trial to inducing Syed Ahmad to hand
over to him (Wan Hassan) 94 international passports for the same
purpose at the same time and place.
	   Roroh is accused of abetting Wan Hassan at the same place and
time while on the charge of forging the visa stamps, he was alleged
to have committed it between April 20 and May 3, 1993.
	   Wan Hassan was represented by Mohd Rafie Mohd Shafie while
Radzuan Ibrahim appeared for Roroh.
	   Replying to a question from Deputy Public Prosecutor Noorin
Badarudin, Syed Ahmad said he could not recall how many passports
he handed over to Wan Hassan.
	   He said he was confident the visas were genuine as he had
performed the haj that year using the visa procured by Wan Hassan.
	   Hearing continues.

	   RESPONDING to the rapidly-changing economic situation, Banthoon
Lamsam, the president of Thai Farmers Bank and chairman of the Thai
Bankers' Association, initiated ''the internal risk management
division'' for analysing risks caused by several sectors.
	   According to a TFB press release, the bank decided to set up the
division to oversee market changes, particularly factors that
affect commercial banks. These include market risk, credit risk,
operational risk, liquidity risk, legal and business risks and
abrupt changes in events (event risk).
	   A source from the bank said Banthoon restructured several
information-based units aimed at catching up with rapid changes in
the banking environment and its regulations.''He [Banthoon] is
concerned over situation changes very much. If the economy is not
as bad as it is today, more units or systems related to information
would be implemented to help banks analysing the situation. The new
division would take care of several aspects such as new rules,
currencies and others,'' the source said.
	   He added that each department considers its own response to
changes in the market and regulations, but now the internal risk
management division would take care of this issue. The output from
this new division is expected to be sent to the bank's executives.
The source also said the new division is different from Thai
Farmers Research Centre, the bank's affiliate, which covers general
economic issues.
	   In the first stage, staff from the bank's investment banking
department will be appointed to oversee this division. The source
said since the market changes would have more and more significant
affects on the banks, it is possible the division will be upgraded
to a department in the future.
	   Tuesday, the bank also announced that it set up ''the investor
relation division'' to coordinate and provide the bank's financial
information and positions of commercial banks to banking stock
analysts, investors and credit rating agencies.
	   Tida Cholaworn, the bank's vice-president, was appointed to
oversee the division. She is responsible for the bank's planning,
policy and budget.
	   Recently, Banthoon created ''the command centre'', a centre for
news and information devices such as wire services, satellites,
television and others. At least 20 employees will be recruited to
monitor the world news via several electronic media and select news
and information for the bank's top executives.
	   Following the central bank's announcement of new accounting
regulations that require banks to record loans on which borrowers
fail to pay interest for more than three months as non-performing
loans, Banthoon ordered every credit department in the bank to
restructure their lending information.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ On a wicket that produced some vicious
turn for spinners, New Zealand was 96 for 4 at the end of a
rain-reduced first day's play of the second cricket test against
Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
	   New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat, but wet ground
conditions prevented any play during the first session.
	   Mathew Horne was the first to be dismissed in the third over of
the innings when he fell caught behind to left arm spinner Niroshan
Bandaratilleke for 1, with the total at 5.
	   New Zealand went in for tea at 16 for 1.
	   Bowling offcutters, Kumara Dharmasena struck in the second over
after tea when he had Stephen Fleming ruled out leg before for 14.
	   But Bryan young and Nathan Astle played cautiously and punished
the loose balls in a determined bid to repair the innings with a
stand of 69 runs for the third wicket.
	   Young (46) despatched six balls to the fence and went through an
anxious moment when he flicked a ball from Muttiah Muralitheran
into the hands of short leg Sanath Jayasuriya, who dropped the
catch.
	   When bad light stopped play eight minutes before the scheduled
close, Astle was unbeaten on 30 made off 116 deliveries. Astle also
saw the exit of Daniel Vettori who replaced Young as night
watchman, and was out in the same over to Bandaratilleke caught at
forward short leg by Hashan Tillekeratne.
	   More than 10,000 spectators packed the Galle International
cricket stadium to see the first Test match being played in the
ancient port city. Another 1,500 people lined the stone ramparts of
the nearby 17th century Dutch fort for a free bird's eye view.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A director of an architect's firm told the
High Court today his company lost two contracts as a result of bad
publicity generated from two newspaper articles about two years
ago.
	   Dennis Teoh Ghin Lye, of Perunding Alam Bina Sdn Bhd, said at
the time the articles were published in The Malay Mail and the New
Straits Times in December 1995, the company had completed about 10
per cent of the two contracts.
	   ``The company also lost potential fees of another contract in
which it was being considered as architects,'' he said.
	   He was giving evidence in a defamation suit by Perunding Alam
Bina against the New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd and four others
over two articles which it claimed meant that the company was
unprofessional, unethical, negligent and privy to the construction
of the carpark building at the Damansara Kim Specialist Hospital.
	   The other four defendants are reporter Errol Oh, former reporter
Teoh Teik Hoong, the editor of The Malay Mail Mohd Fauzi Omar and
the chief news editor of the New Straits Times Tony Francis.
	   Perunding Alam Bina claimed the two articles were published
under the headings ``Act indirectly proposal - way to handle
unprofessional architects and engineers, says MP'' and ``Hospital
developer yet to demolish illegal floor'' in The Malay Mail on Dec
4, 1995, and the NST on Dec 22, 1995 respectively.
	   Perunding Alam Bina is claiming RM20 million as special damages
as well as general damages, interest and costs.
	   In their statement of defence, the defendants stated the
articles did not refer to Perunding Alam Bina but referred to all
professionals involved in the construction industry and the
developer of the hospital who had failed to demolish the
illegally-constructed floor.
	   Dennis Teoh said Perunding Alam Bina, following the publication
of the articles, was investigated by the Malaysian Board of
Architects and found not to be guilty of being unprofessional.
	   He said the articles, and not just the investigation by the
board, caused Perunding Alam Bina's two contracts to be terminated.
	   Hearing before judge Datuk James Foong continues.

Suspected right-wing activists arrested for military weapons theft 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Two South African military
officials with suspected right-wing connections were arrested
Wednesday in connection with two heists of military weapons,
including mortars and rocket launchers, and ammunition.
	   Police, meanwhile, found the body of a soldier who had been
driving a truck carrying 200,000 rounds of ammunition that was
hijacked on Monday, according to Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi. He didn't release details. The other driver was
still missing.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils announced the arrests in
Parliament but didn't the arrested soldiers' names or ranks, saying
only: ``There (are) suspected to be right-wing connections.''
	   Mufamadi said most of the weapons and two armored vehicles
stolen last month have also been recovered.
	   There was no immediate indication whether the thefts were linked
to any plans to destabilize the country ahead of next year's
national elections.
	   The two suspects were to appear in the Bloemfontein Regional
Court on Thursday, 400 kilometers (240 miles) southeast of
Johannesburg.
	   The ammunition was being transported from Tempe Military Base
outside Bloemfontein to another city when it was hijacked Monday.
	   Last month, 117 weapons and two armored trucks were stolen from
the 44 Parachute Brigade at the same base.
	   In addition to the two arrests, a company commander in the base
maintenance unit has been arrested and faces court martial on
charges of negligence for sending the truck without an adequate
escort, Kasrils said.
	   A military inquiry into the first heist found very poor levels
of security at Tempe and a ``very poor attitude of personnel,''
Kasrils said.

	   THE government is reluctant to inject liquidity through the four
state-run financial institutions into the cash-strapped private
sector because of higher credit risks, Deputy Finance Minister
Pisit Lee-artham said.
	   To help the private sector get out of its financial troubles, he
said ministers in charge of economic issues were holding a meeting
[last night] to discuss the matter.
	   It is reported that the Export-Import Bank would also join the
meeting to find a mechanism on how to inject liquidity more
efficiently.
	   Local corporates were likely to be given breathing space as
Pisit hinted that the requirement over loan borrowings may be
relaxed.
	   A report of the National Economic and Social Development Board
submitted to the economic ministers meeting said that outstanding
loans stood at Bt169.75 billion.
	   These loans have been extended by the Export-Import Bank, the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand, the Ministry for
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, and the Small Industry
Finance Corporation.
	   However, the remaining Bt107.49 billion of loan extension has
been put on hold in the wake of the country's contracting economy.
	   A sizeable credit amount which the government has borrowed
overseas to help ease liquidity pressure has drawn widespread
criticism among corporates because lack of liquidity would bring
them close to collapse.
	   ''We have to take a prudent step in extending loans. We have to
think harder if we extend loans but cannot get them back,'' Pisit
noted.
	   Meanwhile, Pisit said that the government's planned bond issues
in the local market still face obstacles as there is no benchmark
of interest rate payment for long-term domestic bonds. He, however,
declined to give more details. The bonds, worth Bt500 billion, are
expected to be issued within the next couple of months.
	   A source at the Finance Ministry said that since the government
had not issued bonds in a long time, the benchmark for interest
rates had not beenestablished since then.
	   ''A study by foreign experts who sketch out the guidelines for
the bond issues has only found the benchmark of interest rates for
one-year bonds,'' he added.
	   For the planned global bond issues worth US$5 billion, central
bank governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul also admitted that interest
rate payment is expected to be quite high.
	   Thus, the government may issue two- or three-month bonds for the
first tranche and long-term bonds may be issued at a later date.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Mon. - The management of a cement mixing plant at
the Inanam Light Industrial Estate has promised to take measures to
prevent smoke and cement dust pollution following complaints from
about 500 workers of nearby factories.
	   Following a report in the New Straits Times about the
predicament of the workers, Uni-Mix Sdn Bhd has promised to install
a dust pollution reading scale to enable them to monitor the
situation.
	   Its general manager K.L. Yap said one of the three cement mixing
machines would also be stopped to reduce pollution, and water would
be sprayed in the area at regular intervals.
	   He said the recent drought had prevented the company from
spraying water to keep the dust level down.
	   Surrounding the plant are about 10 business establishments,
including two food factories and several canteens and coffeeshops.
Workers in these establishments had complained about the dust
pollution.
	   The most badly affected is a garment factory next door where
about 100 workers have to use face masks. The factory manager,
Danny Wong, and owners of the other business establishments had
written letters to the Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council, Department
of Environment and Kota Kinabalu Health Officer since 1991 to
complain but no action was taken.
	   Yap said their operations began in 1984 and it was unfair to ask
the factory to relocate as it was the first to move into the area.
However, he said they would consider moving if a new site was
suitable.

Kosovo: Method in Milosevic's madness, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (JP): There's been much heavy breathing from NATO this
week, as the Western alliance tries to frighten Yugoslav strongman
Slobodan Milosevic into restoring peace in Serbia's
Albanian-majority province of Kosovo. This time, say NATO sources
in Brussels, there will be ``no failure to engage early and
assertively'' (as there certainly was in Bosnia). But it's probably
the same empty bluff as usual, and Milosevic doesn't look the least
bit impressed.
	   The fourth Balkan war of the 1990s is now getting underway in
Kosovo for the same reason as all the others: it serves Milosevic's
domestic political purposes. He needs to distract the Serbs from
their economic misery, and in particular he needs a crisis that
will help him to impose his candidate as president in the election
in Montenegro on May 31.
	   All that's left of Yugoslavia (thanks to Milosevic's previous
wars in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia) is the two republics of
Serbia and Montenegro. The latter has only 600,000 people to
Serbia's 10 million, but it controls a big block of seats in the
federal parliament, so Milosevic's own power was threatened when
Momir Bulatovic, his man in Montenegro, was ousted last October.
	   The new Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, hints at
secession if Belgrade does not drop the extreme Serb nationalist
policies that have brought sanctions and economic ruin to both
parts of the federation. But Milosevic could not survive such a
change of policy, and Montenegrins are basically 'mountain Serbs'.
	   So as part of Milosevic's effort to sway this month's
Montenegrin election in favor of his loyal pawn, Momir Bulatovic,
he has stirred up a new crisis in Kosovo. The idea is to return the
Montenegrins to their old pro-Serb loyalties by emphasizing the
threat to the 'sacred Serbian territory' of Kosovo.
	   But surely there's more to it than that. What about all the
ancient ethnic hatreds that bedevil former Yugoslavia?
	   The 'ancient ethnic hatreds' are a myth. There was hostility
between Serbs and Croats as a result of World War II, but nothing
comparable between Moslems and Christians in Bosnia, nor between
Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. The lie about ancient, irrepressible
ethnic hatreds was fabricated in the early 1990s by European
diplomats to justify their own inaction in the face of the Bosnian
genocide, and swallowed wholesale by the ignorant Western media.
	   The 'Kosovo problem' is actually only nine years old. Serbs and
Albanians lived together in peace in this southernmost bit of
Serbia for a thousand years, until Milosevic discovered in 1989
that the road to power lay in appealing to the paranoid and
self-pitying side of Serbian nationalism.
	   For some centuries Albanian-speaking Moslems have been the
majority in Kosovo, now making up over 90 percent of the province's
2 million people. But few people disputed Kosovo's historic ties to
Serbia, because the former communist government of Yugoslavia gave
the Kosovars full autonomy within Serbia, including
Albanian-language education, media, and medical services.
	   Relations only went bad after Milosevic won power in Belgrade in
1989 by playing up Serbs' fears about their minority status in
Kosovo. The Serbs there were oppressed, he claimed, and promptly
destroyed Kosovo's autonomy. Since 1989, all official institutions
in Kosovo have been monopolized by the tiny Serb minority.
	   The Albanian majority responded with great restraint, creating
their own parallel system of unofficial schools, hospitals and
services while peacefully seeking the return of self-rule. But
their requests, being non-violent, were ignored by everybody.
	   A handful of frustrated Kosovars turned to terrorism two years
ago, but they were repudiated by the vast majority, and the level
of violence in Kosovo was still lower than that in Spain's Basque
provinces -- until March, when Milosevic sent in the Serbian
special forces to massacre an entire village. Now an estimated
120,000 Albanian peasants have abandoned non-violence to enlist in
the Kosovo Liberation Army, and 200 people are already dead.
	   This is presumably the result Milosevic wanted: after the last
nine years, he cannot plead ignorance. But why did he want it?
	   Recently I found some old notes from a conference in Belgrade in
1977, and realized that I interviewed Slobodan Milosevic two
decades ago. The point is that I forgot about it: he was a typical
mid-level apparatchik without an idea in his head, and I didn't
even use the interview. Whereas if I had met Adolf Hitler or Pol
Pot early in their careers, I'm sure I would not have forgotten it.
	   All three men came to power by exploiting a paranoid streak of
nationalism that saw the Germans/Cambodians/Serbs as the innocent
victims of a global conspiracy. Milosevic's wars have cost perhaps
a quarter-million lives, a far smaller toll than Hitler's or Pol
Pot's, but that is not the real distinction between them. It is
that Milosevic is an utterly amoral careerist.
	   Hitler and Pol Pot had an intensity of conviction that made them
into forces of nature: they distilled and personified the fears and
hatreds that drove their genocides. Whereas Milosevic is totally
cynical about the nationalist obsessions he exploits in his
fellow-Serbs. When I first met him, he was cheerfully throwing
Serbian nationalists into jail for anti-communist activities.
	   Milosevic has never sought anybody's death as a matter of
principle; genocide is only desirable if it serves the higher goal
of his own political survival. None of the wars that have wrecked
former Yugoslavia since he came to power were inevitable. They just
seemed like good tactics at the time to a sociopath in power -- a
man with no fixed ideas or values beyond his own advancement, and
nothing much by way of a long-term strategy either.
	   The disproportion between atrocious means and petty ends in
Kosovo is typical of Milosevic. Nor is he deterred by the prospect
that this time the conflict may end in the partition of Serbia
itself, so long as the Serbs blame somebody else: the main thing is
that his own power survives. These tactics have worked before, and
he has no reason to believe that they will not work again.

Second round of talks begins; other strikes loom

	   PARIS (AP) _ French air and rail service faced new strike
threats one week away from the World Cup on Wednesday, while Air
France held new talks to end a three-day-old pilots' walkout.
	   The strike at state-owned Air France _ the World Cup's official
carrier _ was a growing embarrassment to the French government,
which also faced walkouts among Paris transit workers Thursday and
national railworkers Friday.
	   Baggage handlers in a wage dispute at Charles de Gaulle Airport
were on the second day of their strike, and Air France mechanics
and French train engineers were also threatening their own
walkouts.
	   Talks at Air France resumed at 3:20 p.m. (1320 GMT) Wednesday,
after no progress was reported from the first round Tuesday.
	   There were some conciliatory words among the tough talk shortly
before the meeting began in Air France headquarters at Charles de
Gaulle Airport, offering some hope of an early end to the planned
two-week strike.
	   While predicting ``long and difficult'' bargaining, Air France
President Jean-Cyril Spinetta said: ``We sincerely hope we can all
understand each other.''
	   The head of the SNPL union that represents most of the airline's
3,200 pilots softened his tone, saying Spinetta's firmness was
``good for a boss.
	   ``We understand a part of that talk, especially when it's about
competitiveness that must be improved'' and ``controlling overall
salaries,'' said the union boss, Jean-Charles Corbet.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   For the pilots, among the highest paid in the world, the company
wants to give them stock in exchange for 500 million francs (dlrs
83 million) in pay cuts. But it's offered to eventually do away
with a two-tier salary schedule that pays less to new pilots.
	   Air France pilots average 1 million francs (dlrs 160,000),
ranging from 240,000 francs (dlrs 40,000) for new pilots to 1.2
million francs (dlrs 200,000) for 25 years' seniority, the airline
said.
	   The carrier, which managed to report a profit in the last two
years, was set to lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per
day during the strike.
	   France's interior minister criticized the ``lack of
civic-mindedness'' of the pilots, saying he felt ``sadness, almost
shame.''
	   Because of the strike, Jean-Pierre Chevenement told Radio Monte
Carlo, ``France could show itself as a nation that can't organize a
world event anymore.''
	   The walkout disrupted training for the French national soccer
team, said coach Aime Jacquet. The players had been given a
three-day weekend to visit their families and were supposed to
resume training Tuesday.
	   Air France is committed to transporting teams to the 10
competition sites around France and charter other carriers to meet
its obligations.
	   The airline's mechanics threatened on Wednesday to walk off the
job over pay differences between Air Inter and Air France, which
have been merged. No date was set.
	   Paris subway drivers with the Communist-led CGT union were to
walk off the job Thursday, but the Paris transit authority RATP
said it expected no effect on service since the union represented
only a minority of the employees.
	   At the national railway SNCF, conductors with three unions were
to strike Friday night though Sunday evening. Its engineers
announced plans for a June 10 strike, the day the World Cup opens.
	   On World Cup security, Interior Minister Chevenement said
Wednesday that a huge security apparatus would ensure the event was
a ``very big and beautiful party.''
	   He said special anti-terrorist and anti-riot police would give
protection to participating teams.

	   Redefine the FM
	   Of the finance minister's many incongruent functions, those
pertaining to economic affairs must be transferred to an
independent ministry So Vajpayee has been sworn in and has
successfully passed the ordeal of the vote of confidence. The first
batch of cabinet and state ministers is in place. The composition
of this cabinet involved more political horse-trading than at any
time in the past. The most sought after ministry was neither home
nor external affairs nor commerce nor industry, but finance.
	   That is rather surprising, because it is the finance minister
who is likely to have the most difficult time given the present
state of the economy. Even the most accomplished economist would
find the task of tackling the recession, defending the rupee and
controlling the fiscal deficit an unappetising menu. The chances
are that even a promising political career would be ruined in less
than a year in the finance ministry.
	   Jayalalitha wanted her prot,g, Subramanian Swamy to be made
finance minister, not because of his ability to help the economy
but because she expected him to protect her interests in the large
number of cases pending against her. Finally, the crown of thorns
was put on the head of Yashwant Sinha, who earlier held the
portfolio under Chandra Shekhar.
	   In the stories of P.G. Wodehouse, one often encounters a
creditor's man placed in the household of a heavily indebted lord,
most often as a butler, to keep an eye on his affairs. It would
appear that the international financial institutions have a man in
a similar capacity at North Block. Governments may change; finance
ministers may come and go; but this agent stays put in his
ostensibly subordinate position. It is his word which is decisive
in the choice of the finance minister.
	   The new PM is unlikely to try any radical recasting of the
jurisdiction of various ministries. But that needs to be done
urgently. Agriculture, for example, is a state subject. There
exists, nevertheless, a sprawling Ministry of Agriculture in Krishi
Bhawan which deals with agricultural research, rural development,
food procurement, and agricultural prices. The public distribution
system, fertilisers and food-processing, and export and import of
agricultural and related commodities come under other ministries.
No minister has really succeeded in co-ordinating all these tasks
effectively. All matters relating to agriculture need to be brought
under a single umbrella. On the contrary, diverse subjects put
under the canopy of finance need to be separated. But that would
require a PM who can face the combined wrath of the babus.
	   The present FM combines two quite different roles -- one
relating to finance and the other to economic affairs. He has
several incongruent functions -- collection of revenues, both
direct and indirect, non-revenue receipts including foreign
assistance and loans, allocation of funds to various ministries,
day-to-day scrutiny, and internal audit. Apart from these, he plays
a key role in planning strategies and economic policies. Since
1991, he is also the presiding deity of economic reforms,
liberalisation, and globalisation. But this will have to change.
The FM should continue to be in charge of the budget, including
determining the nature and the rates of taxes and allocation of
funds. The day-to-day control of expenditure through the network of
financial advisors sitting in each ministry is entirely superfluous
and should simply be abolished. There is no reason to believe that
an official of the finance ministry is more careful, honest, or
intelligent than his colleagues who happen to be posted in other
cadres.
	   Separate economic functions A new Ministry of Economic Affairs
should be constituted. Given the enormous task of restructuring the
economy, it should have functions relating to developmental
planning, economic reforms, and non-revenue resources including
domestic and foreign borrowings.
	   The traditional Ministry of Finance will continue to enjoy vast
powers; but its work can be managed by an administrator/technocrat.
Economic affairs, on the other hand, will benefit if the presiding
minister has a mass base and political clout strong enough to
outweigh the deep-rooted vested interests in the licence-permit
raj.
	   Reorganisation of the finance ministry has been a long-standing
need. The new PM will be in a better position to bring about this
reform because it would allow him to accommodate two aspirants
instead of one. It would also ensure better discipline in the
cabinet.
	   Moral: Calamity is the only other face of opportunity.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dominican Timoniel Perez doubled home a run and
Akira Etoh smashed a two-run home run as the Central League's
front-running Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Hanshin Tigers 4-2 at
Koshien Stadium Wednesday.
	   Nathan Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, limited the
Tigers to 10 hits over 7 1/3 innings for his fifth victory against
four defeats.
	   Perez hit a one-run double in the third inning and Etoh hit his
seventh homer of the season in the seventh.
	   The Carp are one game ahead of the Yomiuri Giants who moved into
second place with an 11-10 victory over the Yokohama BayStars at
Tokyo Dome.
	   In the bottom of the ninth inning, pinch hitter Sadaaki
Yoshimura singled home the winning run for the Giants.
	   The Giants rapped out 16 hits, including five homeruns.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Lyle Mouton singled home a run in the first
inning and Dwayne Hosey doubled home a run in the eighth as the
Yakult Swallows edged the Chunichi Dragons 3-2.
	   Mouton formerly played with the Chicago White Sox and Hosey was
previously with the Boston Red Sox.
	   In the Pacific League, Hiroki Kokubo tripled home three runs in
the sixth inning as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks edged the Chiba Lotte
Marines 6-5 and moved into the league's solo lead.
	   The Hawks are a 1/2 game ahead of the second-place Nippon Ham
Fighters, whose scheduled game with the Seibu Lions at Seibu
Stadium was rained out.
	   Another game between the Orix BlueWave and the Kintetsu
Buffaloes at Morioka was rained out.

	   THE Pillar of Shame may end up in a transport container after 4
June, following the latest failure of its supporters to win it a
permanent home.
	   The Provisional Urban Council voted down the application by just
one vote yesterday.
	   The council standing committee sacked the application from the
Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of
China 18 votes to 19.
	   The alliance wanted the statue permanently displayed at
council-managed venues.
	   Democrat member Szeto Wah, who is also chairman of the alliance,
said after the meeting he was not surprised by the result.
	   ``This is within our expectations.
	   ``You can see that all appointed members of the council voted
against the application.
	   ``It reflected indirectly on why the Special Administrative
Region government had to appoint members to the two councils (urban
and regional) and the district boards,'' he said.
	   He expected the motion would get more sponsors the next time it
was tabled.
	   He said the alliance might place the eight-metre bronze statue
inside a container after 4 June.
	   ``We may rent a container and put it inside until the day it can
be displayed to the public,'' he added.
	   Councillors debated the motion for about one and half hours.
	   Appointed member Annie Wu, who voted against the motion, said
Hong Kong people should not discuss matters concerning the Beijing
government under the one country, two systems policy.
	   Acting Deputy Director of Urban Services Ma Kai-loong said the
government would not take sides on the matter.
	   Outside the council chamber, alliance members and a group of
tertiary college students protested against the decision.
	   The Pillar of Shame, designed by Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot,
will stand in Victoria Park until tomorrow.

	   Warapatr Todhanakasem, president of Thai Ratings and Information
Services Co (Tris), writes on the concept of good governance. Final
of a three-part series.
	   For many years in the past, rumours in the business circle often
mentioned managers in many firms abusing their authority or
reporting information which was not transparent. This has led to
significant damage to shareholders as well as creditors. Especially
when the economy is going through an era of crisis, these
malpractices, which had been covered up, began to be re-vented from
time to time.
	   A major effort, which was becoming more of a reality in
developing good corporate governance in Thailand and deserved to be
mentioned, was the effort of the Stock Exchange of Thailand which
has studied and published documents on this issue, for example,
Internal Auditing System Manual (published in April 1996), Manual
for Directors of Listed Companies (published in August 1997), and
Internal Auditing Guidelines (expected to be published soon).
	   In addition, on Jan 19 the SET released a statement requiring
all listed companies to set up an Audit Committee by the end of
1999. This committee is responsible for regulating the business in
order to make it more efficient and standardised.
	   Aside from the SET, many other organisations have also been
involved in this topic, such as the Association of Accountants and
Certified Auditors of Thailand and Thai Rating and Information
Services (Tris). It is expected that these organisations will
further cooperate to speed up the development of good corporate
governance in Thailand.
	   Viewpoint There are directors and/or members of senior
management in Thailand who wish to build good governance in their
own companies but are not sure where to begin. Here are some
suggestions that might help those who are interested in getting
started.
	   A Directors and senior management should start by fully
understanding the concept and the major ideas behind good corporate
governance. A good way to do this is to conduct seminars for senior
staff and invite experts to speak on the topic. Adequate time
should be provided for in-depth discussions to ensure that all
participants have a good understanding of the concept.
	   The emphasis here is that the participants must be of director
and senior management level. (Not long ago at a seminar on this
topic, the audience seemed to listen with great interest. The
problem was that 90 per cent of them were middle managers. It seems
doubtful that they will have enough authority to push for the
development of good governance in their own organisation.) B Once
an understanding of the concept and major issues of good governance
has been attained, senior management should examine their own
organisation to determine the current level of effectiveness,
efficiency and transparency. One way of doing this is to take as an
example an organisation that is considered to have good governance
and use it as a comparison and benchmark.
	   C At the end of the process, senior management should have a
clear picture of what it needs to do to attain good governance and
make commitments to start its development in the organisation.
	   Framework of board The responsibility of a company's board is
crucial. In order to have a board that is effective, one needs to
reconsider what makes a good board.
	   There are many key factors that define what makes an effective
Board.
	   1 The chairman and CEO of a company should not be the same
person.
	   2 Select professional directors 3 Have more outside directors
than inside directors.
	   4 Allow institutional investors as directors Evidence has shown
that these suggestions, once implemented, will facilitate the
development of good governance. They also have the potential to
cause problems and therefore must be used with caution and adapted
according to each organisation's environment.
	   Government sector versus private sector : Good governance must
go together. It cannot be denied that the governing process here in
Thailand has some room for improvement. The system in the past and
in the present has been and still is a major obstacle to the
development of the country. The political system is developing very
slowly and without the level of transparency that we would like it
to have.
	   In any event, at the present time there is some progress being
made. The public has begun to press for reforms which hopefully
will result in changes that are effective and on-going.
	   Good governance in the private sector will still continue. But
unless Good governance in the government sector progresses at the
same pace, it will be difficult for the private sector to
materialise this concept at the level society would like to see.
	   The first and second parts were published on May 27 and June 2.

	   The country's economic downturn has not only affected foreign
capital inflow and liquidity. To reduce expenses and maximise use
of staff, small and middle-sized companies have cancelled training
programmes.
	   The trend has been similar in other countries, however. ''We
can't say the situation here is unique, but it is different,''
Chainarong Indharameesup, Chairman of CSN Associates, said.
	   Before the flotation of the baht in July last year,
extraordinarily high economic growth fuelled the rapid expansion of
companies, which faced the urgent need for trained, experienced
mid-level and upper-level personnel.
	   Companies entered a battle to ''pinch'' staff from competitors,
and salaries and perks rose to unprecedented levels. Far from
easing the strain on Thailand's workforce capacity, the entry of
foreign joint ventures increased pressure. New companies required
sales people, accountants, translators and other mid-level
personnel in numbers that the country lacked.
	   In one case, the managing director of a long-time US-Thai joint
venture told The Nation that he was pleased that his staff turnover
had dropped to 12 per cent per quarter. He would not divulge how
high turnover had been previously.
	   Constant staff movement from one company to another placed a
heavy burden on business. In their search for experienced staff,
companies were hiring people that often lacked the necessary
training and experience.
	   A public relations trainee in one hotel in 1991, for instance,
moved after one year to another hotel as a PR assistant. Every six
months thereafter, she changed hotels, rising in status and
remuneration with each move. At the end of two years, she had more
than quadrupled her original salary and achieved the title of PR
director.
	   Because she had been moving so much, however, she had not
allowed herself enough time to learn under more experienced
managers. Her company was also not in a position to train her. They
had ''bought'' her for her title and expected her to possess the
skills required of her job.
	   They didn't have the time to train her, either. With economic
growth came opportunities that had to be seized immediately, and
companies were reluctant to lose productive staff to long-term
training.
	   Staff training was not put on hold entirely. Chainarong pointed
out that companies, aware of the problem, tried to break down jobs
into smaller units. ''These were short-term measures,'' he said.
''They wanted people quickly. The qualifications and background of
employees not up to standard, so they reduced the training process
into short periods.'' As a result, payroll increased as well, with
companies hiring more and more people.
	   After the flotation, when the value of the baht fell and
financial problems set in, companies looking to reduce expenditure
began cutting advertising, research and outside training budgets
and reducing staff numbers. Remaining staff have seen their areas
of responsibility expand, but companies are still not investing in
long-term training.
	   Companies still planning to lay off additional people are
reluctant to spend resources on soon-to-be former employees. ''But
training also goes against attitudes,'' Chainarong pointed out.
	   Local middle-size companies tend to rely on experience and
on-the-job training. Multinational companies like Citibank train
new recruits for around six months, an expense that local companies
would not accept.
	   More importantly, for training to be fully utilised, employees
must be empowered to handle their own decision-making within their
areas of expertise. Can Thai companies adapt their management
structure to accommodate new methods and techniques? ''There is a
tendency,'' Chainarong admitted, ''for local companies to reject
the performance of the new generation.'' Multinationals, however,
are still planning new joint ventures in Thailand or expanding
their operations here, and it is in these companies that Chainarong
has hope.
	   ''They're willing to transfer knowledge and empower their
employees, and local companies will have the opportunity to observe
these new processes,'' he said.

	   UTRECHT: Teun de Nooiyer scored a last-gasp golden goal to give
Holland a 3-2 sudden death victory over Spain in the men's hockey
World Cup final yesterday.
	   The decisive goal came in the 83rd minute with just two minutes
of extra time remaining. The Dutch, who had fought back from 2-0
down late in the match, forced a penalty corner and although the
subsequent shot by Bram Lomans was saved, the ball fell at the feet
of de Nooijer who scooped past Ramon Jufresa, the outstanding
Spanish goalkeeper.
	   For a long time it looked as if the Dutch men, who beat Spain in
the 1996 Olympic final, were going to follow their women's team by
collecting silver medals.
	   Spain led 1-0 after 18 minutes after breaking the length of the
field for Javier Arnau to lash in a cross shot and went 2-0 up in
the 55th as Victor Pujol deflected a pass past the Dutch
goalkeeper.
	   Spain, who lost brilliant forward Jaun Escarre with a pulled
hamstring soon after their first goal, missed chances to make it
3-0 then saw their lead wiped out in two minutes.
	   In the 59th, Dutch captain Stephan Veen beat Jufresa, who until
then had seemed impossible to pass, with a fine cross shot. Before
Spain could recover their composure, the Dutch forced their fifth
corner and Lomans made it 2-2, finding a way past Jufresa with a
powerful flick for his ninth goal of the Cup.
	   The Dutch, who did most of the attacking in the game, had three
more corners before the end of full time, one in the first period
of extra time before they finally pierced the Spanish goal at their
tenth corner of the match.
	   The match was a repeat of the Atlanta Olympic final which the
Dutch won 3-1. Like the Australian women, who won their final on
Sunday, the Dutch now hold both the Olympic and World Cup titles.
	   RIC Charlesworth, coach of the Australian women's team that
successfully defended their world title here on Sunday, beating
Holland 3-2 in a thrilling final, said they would only get better.
	   The reigning Olympic and Champions Trophy holders went behind to
a 46-second effort from Ellen Dubbledam-Kuiper, but goals from
Annan, Julie Towers and Juliet Haslam eased them away only for
Julie Deiters' goal in the 62nd minute to give them a very nervy
last eight minutes.
	   ``I am very pleased and I think that this is just reward for the
girls as they are the hardest working bunch of athletes in any
national Australian side,'' Charlesworth said.
	   ``The guts they showed after the early goal, which is worth a
goal to the Dutch, is indicative of how good this side is.

	   Lowland farmers in Doi Inthanond, suffering from a debilitating
drought and a two-decade dispute with highland farmers in watershed
forests, have staged protests to draw attention to their plight and
to pressure the government to amend the Cabinet resolution allowing
people to live in sensitive forest areas. Smansnid Svasti counters
the proponents of watershed settlements.
	   The World Rainforest Movement (WRM) is much concerned over the
plight of our hill tribes, who, its members feel, are under threat
of ''losing their ancestral lands and their only known way of
life''. And they are rightly indignant if the facts they base their
opinion on are correct.
	   Unfortunately, these facts are a tissue of unprincipled
propaganda.
	   Having been involved for over 12 years in a lowland peoples'
initiative in Northern Thailand to restore and conserve their
forest and water resources, I am appalled that the international
community should be exploited with such misinformation on issues of
such grave concern to us all.
	   True reports have been represented as being one-sided; biased
reports exonerating wrongdoers are declared to be true. But worst
of all, WRM has been fed with a shameless falsification of
historical records and false records of tribal occupation in
Northern Thailand and of forest clearance there.
	   Recent settlers How long have tribal peoples been living in the
highland forests? Since ''time immemorial'' as WRM has understood?
	   The Thais, both the Tai Noi, those of us occupying present-day
Thailand, and the Tai Yai of the Shan States and Mae Hong Son, have
always settled in the valleys. The Karen and the Lua, our
indigenous tribal peoples, generally settled in forest
mid-catchment, swiddening (''slashing and burning'') rotationally
and maintaining a healthy forest cover, at least while their
populations didn't increase overwhelmingly. Records of the Karen
presence go back to the 17th century; the Lua were present when the
Thais migrated into the country 1,000 years ago. The mountains were
left undisturbed; water and forest resources were plentiful.
	   Occupation of the high-altitude forests first began when
opium-growing peoples migrated from China in the 1880s (''Migrants
of the Mountains'', Geddes, 1968) slashing and burning clearings to
grow hill rice, maize and opium, which do not grow well at lower
altitudes. By 1947 there were around 20,000 opium-growers in the
hills, but Thailand still had 74-per-cent forest cover, and any
damage to the headwaters of rivers was containable (Royal Forest
Department records).
	   After the Chinese revolution of 1949, three waves of refugee
migration swelled the highland population, the largest being in the
early 1970s. Registration of the first Hmong settlement on Doi
Inthanond was in 1970; the rest followed in 1975 (Chomtong District
Office). Records of the other opium-growing peoples follow the same
pattern, small numbers of migrants arriving before 1950 but numbers
rapidly swelling after 1970 (Chaturabhand, 1988). The Present
numbers of traditional opium-growers are in excess of 315,000
(Tribal Research Institute, 1995).
	   Since World War II Thailand has a single relatively peaceful
country surrounded by neighbours at war. Vast numbers of refugees
have fled and are continuing to flee from China, Cambodia, Burma,
Laos and Vietnam. These people are political refugees, not
indigenous tribal peoples.
	   The historical record then is that apart from the Lua and the
Karen, whose settlements in mid-catchment are not threatening the
nation's forest and water resources, the great majority of highland
settlements were founded no more than 30 years ago, most of them
much less. This is hardly ''time immemorial'', hardly enough time
for their lands to be called ''ancestral''.
	   The WRM says: ''[Let us] allow those with the knowledge and
experience to preserve that which they have been protecting for
centuries.'' In their shifting cultivation, the opium-growing
peoples use the long-cultivation/very-long-fallow system. ''In
areas that have been cultivated in this fashion the forest almost
never returns within a human lifetime'' (''Farmers in the Forest'',
Kunstadter, 1978). Cultivation patterns of this kind are more
suited to valley farming, true to the Hmongs' origins in the
Yangtze and Yellow River basins. They have never developed forest
resource-management strategies, viewing forest land as free
consumer goods (Kunstadter, ibid).
	   The reason forest cover in Mae Hong Son province is greater than
in neighbouring provinces is because much of its rugged mountain
terrain is difficult of access and the population is therefore much
lower. Of this population the latest figures (1996) show that 55
per cent are Tai Yai, five per cent Northern Thai and 40 per cent
hill tribes (Mae Hong Son Provincial Records), not the 80 per cent
quoted in the The Round House's article (The Nation, June 2). The
provincial office has just reported that more of the forest is
being lost, whole hills being converted to cabbage fields by the
Hmong.
	   Commercial farming The WRM says: ''Their only known way of life
[is] threatened.'' Roads have been constructed into the highlands
and electricity now reaches into formerly remote areas. With this
ease of communication, tribal communities naturally wish to share
in the conveniences that the new technology they see on TV brings.
This means greater market production, their ways of life changing
from farming for subsistence to farming for profit. The idea of an
innocent ethnic people practising their timeless traditional wisdom
is an attractive one, but no group of people can remain isolated
and unchanging in our rapidly ''developing'' society, and the
younger generation of tribal people are especially eager for
change.
	   Farming on a commercial scale rather than for subsistence has
inevitably meant greater use of soil and water resources. Ever
wider areas of forest have been and are being removed for the
growing of cash crops, especially in anticipation of the survey
ordered by the Cabinet decisions of April 1997 giving land rights
in protected forests to those who can prove occupation before 1993;
such ''proof'' can be as flimsy as a neighbour's word.
	   There is less harm in forest clearance on this scale if the
clearance is in the lowlands. But it is not. It is being done in
the upper watershed forests, the fragile and critical areas where
the headwaters of our rivers are formed.
	   The baseline of any decision made on the feasibility of forest
settlements must be ecological sustainability, and this depends on
forest type, altitude and the morphological structure of the
landscape.
	   In England there is concern, sometimes bordering on panic, when
there is a two-month drought. In monsoon climates, such as that of
Northern Thailand, the drought is regularly seven and sometimes
nine months long. No rain falls during this time. In such
situations soils have to be deep and rich enough in humus to hold
the rain, controlling its flow so that watercourses continue to
run, filled with rain that fell several months before.
	   High-altitude evergreen forests (over 1,000 metres) can produce
such soil. In the cooler temperatures of these forests,
decomposition of organic material is slower, allowing a high
build-up of organic material in contrast to the lower forests,
where higher temperatures speed up decomposition. There is little
chance for any build-up of humus in such conditions, and the soil
remains poor -- as in a rainforest.
	   But the soils of our high evergreen forests are deep enough and
rich enough to hold the monsoon rains as they fall, releasing them
as perennial streams throughout the year. This is why we advocate
that these forests be kept free of human activity, not so that they
can be kept in ''pristine condition for day excursions of the
rich'' but so as to ensure the survival of us all.
	   (The issue of environmental survival is simple. But the social
circumstances are far more complex than appearances would suggest,
not at all a case of rich versus poor or modern man versus tribal
people. One of our gravest concerns over the Cabinet decisions of
April 1997 is that it is yet another attempt to secure land
holdings by real-estate developers and land speculators, many of
whom are in every government and who have already encroached on
forest lands to build golf courses and tourist resorts.) Community
forestry Not all forests need be free of human habitation.
Settlements in the lower forests, such as those in mid-catchment
made by the Karen and the Lua, are perfectly sustainable if they
hold to their traditional management practices. Settlements in
reserve forests where community forestry will increase the nation's
forest cover should be encouraged and supported.
	   But the evergreen headwater forests should be areas of strict
conservation, as their removal brings about environmental disaster.
Heavy rains wash away the soil, which quickly silts up dams,
reservoirs and rivers. With little soil left to hold the rains, the
headwaters dry up, as do subsequently the streams to the valleys.
Seventy-two of the 76 provinces of Thailand now suffer regularly
from dried-up streams due to the destruction of their headwater
forests, and in 1996 floods drowned livestock and ruined crops and
property in 64 provinces.
	   Every rainy season now lowland paddies are buried to grow their
crops.
	   In the dry season their watercourses and their wells dry up, and
massive siltation has reduced reservoirs to a fraction of their
planned capacity. Villagers queue with buckets to buy water from
municipal trucks. In the kind of heat we have experienced this
year, the suffering is unimaginable unless you have suffered
similarly yourself.
	   The Northern Farmers Network does not address lowlanders'
problems, since over 95 per cent of its members are highlanders.
The Assembly of the Poor deals with Northeasterner's problems. So
up to now the problems of lowlanders in the North have had no
exposure. They have had no voice.
	   But their desperation has forced them to act. A recent protest
by 10,000 lowland farmers to draw attention to their plight drew a
startling 40,000-strong support, some people travelling 90 km to
join the protest. There had been no lobbying. The spontaneous
gathering showed that they too were victims of the same conditions.
	   What the WRM was informed of as being ''a smear campaign'' is
simply that after years of being suppressed, the true facts of
highland forest destruction are beginning to emerge.
	   But you should not take my word for it. Neither should you take
the word of the Northern Farmers Network or their Bangkok-based
support organisations. Please don't take anyone's word. The only
truthful and reliable source of environmental matters is the
environment itself. Drive up the rugged mountain roads of Samoeng
and Mae Sariang and see the cabbages and carnations, the potatoes
and the gerberas stretching across the ridges where once stood
great forests. Have the courage to listen only to the shaven hills
and believe only the evidence of your own eyes.
	   This article is a response to ''Scapegoats of deforestation''

	   The Cabinet is about to debate a proposal to amend the Wang Nam
Khieu resolution passed by the previous Chavalit government
allowing people to live in sensitive forest areas.

	   MALAYSIA still have a long way to go before they can take their
place among the top six or even eight hockey playing countries in
the world.
	   The national team need to improve in almost every aspect of the
game, namely speed, fitness, tactics, mental attitude and, more
importantly, finishing.
	   Consistency is another weakness plaguing the team. They played
good hockey in patches in Utrecht, which was not good enough to win
matches.
	   In the opening match against Pakistan, the former world
champions faced some problems in the second half but the Malaysians
could not sustain the good run. Pakistan eventually won 7-2.
	   It was a winning game against Poland and Malaysia could have
achieved their top four placing target in the group. But they threw
away that chance when they drew 1-1.
	   Chances like these, especially in the World Cup, do not come
easy. If the better team do not capitalise on them, they are no
better than the weaker team.
	   Malaysia still had the chance to finish in the top four when
they met England, but that too slipped from their grasp when they
lost 1-3.
	   It was a foregone conclusion that they did not stand a chance
against Australia and Spain, to whom they lost 8-0 and 3-0
respectively.
	   Malaysia hit an all-time low when they played Spain. Everything
they did went wrong. They could not stop the ball, passing was not
accurate and they looked like a bunch of novices.
	   Team officials will argue that they played well against England,
New Zealand and Poland and they can talk about the misses and
wasted opportunities.
	   Of course, there were so many misses and close matches but
playing at world class level, no team should be missing as many
chances as the Malaysian team did.
	   Performance is important but then again, the final result is
what counts.
	   They cannot go on saying we missed our chances against Poland
and England or even New Zealand in the classification match. It
will go down in history that Malaysia finished 11th out of 12 teams
in the World Cup.
	   Coach Volker Knapp wasted so much of time and placed too much
emphasis on penalty corners. There were some 12 or 13 variations
and all that for nothing because they couldn't score from them.
	   To say they did not receive as many penalty corners to convert
would not be true.
	   Malaysia earned a total of 32 penalty corners and scored only
five, which works out to a 15.6 per cent, down from about 30 per
cent during the qualifiers in Kuala Lumpur in March last year.
	   Against Pakistan, they earned 11 penalty corners and scored only
two through Nor Saiful Zaini's direct hits.
	   Against Poland, they received eight and scored only one, and
that, too, from a rebound.
	   Malaysia played a defensive game against Australia and Spain,
where there were not many penalty corners in Malaysia's favour.
	   However, not everyone in the team played badly. Players who
deserve mention are R. Shankar, Lailin Abu Hasaan and Nasihin
Nubli.
	   Nasihin played only against Poland in the 11th-12th placing
match and did well.
	   Mirnawan Nawawi and Nor Saiful Zaini, who used to be feared
forwards a few years back, have dipped in performance and so has M.
Kaliswaran.
	   A lot of work needs to be done if Malaysia are to avoid another
humiliation in the Commonwealth Games in September.

	   CONTRARY to pre-handover predictions, the judiciary has managed
to retain its independence almost a year after the change of
sovereignty, according to a leading academic.
	   Richard Cullen, visiting fellow at the City University's faculty
of law, said so far there had been no concrete evidence to prove
that judges had been influenced either by the government or by
Beijing.
	   ``The general condition is generally much more positive than the
gloomy situation forecast before the handover,'' he told a
conference on comparative judicial systems at the City University.
	   ``Judges appear to have maintained their independence despite
the change of sovereignty.'' The two-day conference which started
yesterday is being attended by 50 legal experts from the Department
of Justice, local universities and the mainland.
	   Four judges of the Supreme People's Court _ Judge Ge Xingjun,
Judge Li Fan, Judge Liu Zhixin and Judge Wang Yanbin _ are among
the participants.
	   Mr Cullen said it was too early to tell whether local judges
would be able to retain their independence in the next few years.
	   He said the High Court decision last year recognising the
legality of the controversial Provisional Legislative Council was
something that should be reflected upon.
	   ``I think keeping judicial independence is a matter for Hong
Kong people to decide,'' Mr Cullen said.
	   ``I mean, local judges and the legal profession will have to
decide on the extent of judicial independence and not Beijing.'' Mr
Cullen said ordinary people also had a pivotal role to play in
retaining judicial independence.
	   He said the 53 per cent voter turnout during the 24 May
Legislative Council elections proved that ordinary people were
willing to speak up.
	   Professor Edward Tyler, dean of the City University's faculty of
law, said he had not seen any signs of interference by the
government in the work of judges.
	   But he said the contractual arrangements for magistrates could
make them vulnerable to interference.

	   Peter Dennis Anthony Sutch, 53, has an impressive bio-data.
Chairman of the UK-based Swire Group in Hong Kong, he oversees John
Swire  Sons (HK) Ltd, Swire Pacific Ltd, Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd, and Swire Properties Ltd. He is also a board member of the
HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Sutch, who joined Cathay
Pacific Airways 28 years ago, has spent the last 14 as its managing
director. He was in India recently and talked to Neera Bhardwaj of
the ambitious plans the airline has been nurturing for the country.
This despite it facing turbulent weather -- its profit for 1997 at
$262 million was down 37.5 per cent compared to the previous year.
Sutch is betting on the new, $1-billion airport at Chek Lap Kok to
make Hong Kong the preferred hub for Asia QYou are visiting India
after four years...
	   A Yes, but it is no reflection on how important India is in our
scheme of things. It is a reflection on how business has been in
Hong Kong, leading up to the handover (to China). In fact, 1997 was
a good year for India. It exceeded the target on both passenger and
cargo fronts. That is extremely satisfactory considering there was
no extra capacity flying through here.
	   Q Are you planning to rectify that?
	   A Our (flying) schedules in India have remained the same for the
last 10-12 years. It is no secret that we feel there is a bigger
market in India. I am hoping our ongoing dialogue with Air-India
will help our respective governments to meet again on increasing
frequencies. One of the difficulties for the last two or three
years was [reviewing] air agreements between the two governments.
That was sorted out last year. Now we can add on to that specific
agenda in terms of capacity and frequency.
	   Our airport in Hong Kong had put a restriction on growth of
frequencies because of limited space. But from 6 July we will have
a new airport with 24-hour operations, and by November it will have
two runways. This will enable Hong Kong to take full advantage of
its very strategic geographic position in Asia and act as a funnel
to feed traffic.
	   Q What is the progress on flights from Delhi?
	   A We have been looking at Delhi for quite some time now. We hope
to arrange a meeting between the Hong Kong and Indian governments.
We came to Calcutta in 1950 and 48 years later we are not able to
fly from Delhi. I am here to help the dialogue move forward. The
Hong Kong government will be happy to give reciprocal rights to
Air-India. But to work out an arrangement you need to meet. The
last meeting between the governments was in 1996.
	   Q You had a bad year last year. How are you likely to fare this
year?
	   A We had good growth in the first five months in 1997. The
problems began in the second half. The first was clearly related to
the handover of Hong Kong. A month before the transition the media
gave a picture of People's Liberation Army patrolling the streets
of Hong Kong. That kept the hotel rooms empty and the traffic to
Hong Kong declined. Though our first and business class business
soon understood that it was business as usual, the leisure
traveller, who depends on television for news, decided to play it
safe.
	   The second problem was the Asian economy. The Thai baht devalued
on 2 July and that set the dominos falling. And to continue the
tale of woes, the Indonesian fire cancelled trips and then there
was the chicken flu. The momentum of these (problems) is likely to
continue well into 1998.
	   Q So where do you stand now?
	   A We have five aircraft out of service, though this does not
mean that we are a shrinking airline. We should grow at 6.5 per
cent in 1998 instead of the planned 9.5 per cent. We are going to
take delivery of 10 new aircraft. The sad part was that for the
first time we had to retrench over 800 employees. However, we
remain positive about Hong Kong and the new airport will help to
make it the hub of Asia. We plan to give Singapore a run for its
money.

<TEXT>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants US$1 billion
from staunch ally the United States to build roads for Jewish
settlers occupying Palestinian land as a condition for more
withdrawal from the West Bank. It is indeed mind-boggling how
further Jewish construction in the occupied territories could lead
to more withdrawals. No doubt Netanyahu has good reason to build
more roads: by doing that, he is blocking all roads to peace.
	   Last Friday Netanyahu marked his second anniversary in power. He
has much to celebrate, for within that short period he has
successfully buried the peace process for good. That shouldn't
surprise anyone. After all, Netanyahu has always been an unabashed
critic of the ''land for peace'' deal. The Oslo peace accord, he
believes, poses a grave danger to his vision of ''Greater Israel'',
and any Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories would
imperil the existence of the Jewish state.
	   Likewise it is not surprising that the Clinton administration
has been slow to realise its Israeli friend is not too keen on
striking peace with the Palestinians. Netanyahu has indeed cleverly
justified his stubborness by accusing the Palestinian Authority of
violating its promises to crack down on terrorism. That there has
been no major terrorist attack against Israel in nine months is
conveniently ignored.
	   But it appears that Netanyahu's American allies have bought his
argument. A majority in the Congress has urged Clinton not to force
Israel into ''accepting something it did not want''. House speaker
Newt Gingrich, a presidential aspirant, went a step further: he
branded Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an ''agent of
Palestine'' for her proposal to kick-start the peace process.
	   But despite what Gingrich and his ilk would have us believe, the
Albright proposal is already very much pro-Israel. If Israel now
withdraws from 13 per cent of the West Bank as the US suggests,
then the total pre-final-status withdrawal will amount to some 40
per cent of the West Bank. This falls short of the Oslo agreements.
Under the accord, Israel should by now be turning over half of the
occupied territories to the Palestinians, and the two sides should
have moved to the final negotiations on a permanent settlement.
	   The Palestinians know that they would be disadvantaged by the
Albright proposal: they would have to negotiate the other 60 per
cent of the West Bank and haggle over Jerusalem from a rather weak
position. Yet they went along with it. In contrast Netanyahu has
adamantly refused to withdraw from more than nine per cent. Any
more, he said, would mean mortal danger to Israel's security. If he
thinks that his measly offer marks the end of Israel's possible
territorial concessions, how on Earth are the Palestinians build a
state from the series of disconnected fragments forming one-third
of West Bank? Then again, Netanyahu doesn't want a Palestinian
state.
	   Netanyahu has until Friday to respond to the US offer. Most
likely he will be counting on his American ally to give him more
time. Already the US has extended its ultimatum numerous times.
There is no question that Netanyahu is seeking to buy more time,
perhaps waiting for a major terrorist attack as a pretext to
effectively kill the peace accord. Such a scenario is fast becoming
a self-fulfilling prophesy. As more and more Palestinians become
frustrated with Netanyahu's bull-headedness, critics of moderate
Palestinian Authority leader Yasir Arafat are likely to resort to
violence, and to add fuel to the fire, Netanyahu is himself goading
the Palestinians by authorising the expansion of Jewish settlements
on occupied land and in disputed Jerusalem.
	   American and Israeli spin doctors have for years portrayed the
Palestinians as a band of hard-line terrorists. On the contrary, it
is the Palestinians who have made concessions: they have now agreed
to give much of their homeland to the Israelis. All they want is a
state of their own from the sliver of land in the Gaza Strip plus
the West Bank. This is no small concession, akin to giving up the
house for the right to live in the back yard.
	   When Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, spoke of ''a people
without a land'' looking for ''a land without a people'',
apparently he was not aware of the presence of an Arab population
in Palestine. Last month Nobel Peace laureate Shimon Peres wrote:
''After 50 years, it is time for us to put right the mistake we
have made: we have not taken into account the existence of another
people.'' But it looks as if Netanyahu is not listening. Neither
are his US backers.

	   LACK of international matches is one of the reasons why many
countries, especially from Asia, played below expectations in the
World Cup.
	   But all is not lost for them. If the International Hockey
Federation (FIH) Task Force approve some of the proposals, these
teams are likely to have more matches.
	   The Task Force are considering increasing the number of teams in
the global meet and in the Champions Trophy.
	   FIH president Juan Angel Calzado said after their congress
meeting on Saturday that the proposals have been under discussion
for some time and the outcome will be known before the executive
board meeting in August.
	   Apart from that, there are plans to increase the number of teams
in the Champions Trophy.
	   They are looking at 14 teams in two divisions. The bottom six or
seven teams in the World Cup, too, need constant top class
competition to raise their standards.
	   Currently, only the top six countries play in the Champions
Trophy. This year's tournament will be held in Lahore, Pakistan, in
October.
	   FIH are also studying the possibility of increasing the number
of players to be registered in a team for the World Cup.
	   Currently, only 16 players are allowed to be registered. They
are considering increasing it by two.
	   In the recent World Cup, the German women's team had to use
their reserve goalkeeper in another position because all the other
players were injured.
	   Calzado said in a tight scheduled meet like the World Cup, it
was difficult for injured players to recover over short periods.

	   The Hamburg-bound train collided with the auto at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour as it approached the station in Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover just before 11 a.m.,
officials said. The train had been carrying more than 350
passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition 200 serious injuries. At least six survivors were taken to
a public building in Hanover.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line inaugurated in 1991, and the deadliest in western Germany
since World War II.

Much-scorned 'farmer' Samak hits back with perfect timing, NATION

	   MAYBE what it will take to bring down the Chuan government is a
much-scorned ''farmer''.
	   Academic Thirayuth Boonmi may be the most formidable in taking
on the administration. Telecom tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra may be the
most financially equipped to create political waves. Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, meanwhile, has not given up on efforts to put Chuan
Leekpai out of the way.
	   The prime minister, however, has brushed them aside with
relative ease.
	   But not Samak Sundaravej.
	   In political limbo since most of his Prachakorn Thai MPs broke
ranks late last year to support Chuan as prime minister, Samak hit
back the hardest on Monday when he managed to flush the rebels out
of the party's executive board. That means expelling them from the
party will be a pushover.
	   And Samak seemed to have waited for the best time to strike. If
he had moved earlier, there would not have been political pressure
on Chuan, who was enjoying high popularity and constitutional
immunity against House dissolution. With Chuan's image being
besieged by the rich-and-poor issue and the immunity evaporating
following the recent passage of organic laws, the Prachakorn Thai
case is beginning to have a greater impact.
	   At first Samak made it look like the expulsion of the rebels
from the party's board was a tedious process. But his systematic
triumphs over them were quite comfortable, thus raising the
question whether he was just dragging his feet and waiting for the
right time.
	   And the long wait enabled Samak to build a good case if the
rebels, once totally expelled from the party, want to take the
fight to the Constitution Court. The dissidents now have violated
the party's resolutions on key legislation, including the
recently-passed financial executive decrees, which would likely
cost them the court's sympathy.
	   If Samak had expelled them earlier, he would have been only
equipped with charges that they had breached the party's decision
against supporting Chuan as prime minister. On that matter, the
rebels would have argued that the Constitution allows them to
exercise their conscience. The same argument would also have
applied to back their decision to vote for the government at the
end of the censure debate in March.
	   If the court rules in Samak's favour and the rebels lose their
MP status, the Chuan government's parliamentary strength would be
reduced to 196, a wafer-thin majority. Its stability in the eyes of
the international community will disappear and Chuan may have no
choice but to dissolve the House.
	   Even if the rebels win the fight in the constitutional court,
finding a new party could trigger a major political controversy.
Due to serious image problems, not all of them could join the
Democrats.
	   ''Public confidence in the government might be affected,'' Chuan
admitted Tuesday. ''But the government will still have majority
control in Parliament.'' Samak has called himself a ''farmer'' who
got bitten by ''cobras'' he had given shelter to. The rebels, who
have always spoken of him in high regard, are turning increasingly
aggressive.
	   ''This party has been run as a cult. One man dictates
everything,'' said Vatana Asavahame, deputy interior minister and
one of the rebels.
	   The group can use another tactic to stall Samak, by filing
complaints with the civil court and the Election Commission against
''illegal'' manoeuverings by Samak when he beat them out of the
party's executive board.
	   The Democrat Party has given the rebels encouragement by saying
their ministerial posts would be kept intact, and no opposition
party would be brought in to boost the government's stability.
	   ''We believe in the Democrats,'' said Man Pattanothai, another
''cobra''. ''I believe they appreciate what we have done [for the
government].''

	   RICKY CHEN is making a comeback to the Commonwealth Games
bowling squad.
	   National chief coach Sid Allen has listed the veteran at the top
of the men's team list for the Asian FIQ championships in Taiwan
from July 19 to 26.
	   Allen has also given youngsters Alex Liew, Ben Heng and Wendy
Chai their graduation certificates as they will compete alongside
their seniors in a sanctioned open championship for the first time.
	   ``We wanted to maintain the main core of the team that did a
wonderful job at the Jakarta Sea Games last year,'' said Allen.
	   ``And Ricky (Chen) delivered Malaysia's first bowling gold medal
in Jakarta by winning the singles.
	   ``Two weeks ago he was having second thoughts about leaving the
team and wanted to get back in. I had no problems with this and
decided to list him for the Asian FIQ based on his good form at the
recent Genting International Open.
	   ``He will be back in regular training from now till the end of
the year to prepare for the Bangkok Asian Games in December,'' said
the Canadian yesterday.
	   National regulars Azidi Ameran, Gerald Samuel and Karen Lian
made way for Liew, Heng and Wendy as the youngsters are being
groomed for major events at the end of the year.
	   ``We needed to find room for the young bowlers. I'm quite happy
with how Azidi and Gerald are bowling but they fared the poorest at
the Jakarta Games and that was how the decision was made.
	   ``However, Karen will be coming in for the World Team Cup
qualifiers right after the tournament to replace the weakest bowler
at the time.''
	   He said Liew won the Melbourne Cup last year and Heng is
currently in superb form. And Wendy has never represented the
country.
	   Squad - Men: Kenny Ang, Daniel Lim, Ben Heng, Alex Liew, Ng Yiew
Hup, Ricky Chen; Women: Shalin Zulkifli, Lai Kin Ngoh, Sharon Low,
Sarah Yap, Low Poh Lian, Wendy Chai.

	   FIVE stock market players ``tricked'' watchdogs by secretly
taking over a lucrative company because they could not afford to
follow the rules, a jury was told yesterday.
	   The buyout was hidden from regulators because the purchasers did
not have $1 billion that would have been required to back the deal,
Martin Wilson, QC, told the Court of First Instance.
	   David Tong Cun-lin, 48, his sister-in-law Hsu Jye, 40, Arthur
Lai Cheuk-kwan, 48, his brother Raymond Lai Chik-fan, 48, and Peter
Mou Chi-luen, 45, deny plotting to defraud the Securities and
Futures Commission and the Committee on Takeovers and Mergers
between January 1990 and June 1991.
	   Two companies connected to Tong acquired 66 per cent of
Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond's company, Bond Corporation
International, Mr Wilson told the court.
	   However, only 34.5 per cent of the deal was carried out with the
knowledge of the SFC and the mergers committee, the jury heard.
	   Those shares were bought by Thomson Pacific, whose executive
chairman was Tong.
	   ``The SFC was tricked into believing that was all Thomson
Pacific was acquiring,'' Mr Wilson said.
	   But another 31.5 per cent was bought through Chin Tung, Arthur
Lai's brokerage, because Tong or his four alleged accomplices could
not afford to meet legal requirements set by the SFC, it was
alleged.
	   Any group which acquires more than 35 per cent of shares with
voting rights in a listed company must make a ``general offer'' to
buy out all shareholders, the jury heard.
	   But this could have cost the five accused more than $1 billion _
a sum they could not muster, Mr Wilson said.
	   So to gain control they failed to reveal to the SFC that the
companies involved were working in concert.
	   Bond Corporation International Holdings (BCIL) had been an
attractive investment to Tong and Thomson Pacific because of its
cash reserves, the jury heard.
	   ``Although Bond Corporation was in trouble, BCIL was a company
with substantial cash resources,'' Mr Wilson said.
	   ``They wanted to get their hands on the cash by acquiring BCIL,
but we will show they did not have the means to make a general
offer.
	   ``Therefore, they were prepared to defraud the SFC and the
committee in order to acquire the cash resources.
	   ``We say everyone of these defendants knew that.'' Arthur Lai is
also accused of taking A$2 million (HK$9.4 million) and HK$26.4
million in bribes.
	   Tong is accused of offering a $26.4 million bribe, while Raymond
Lai and Mou face two counts of aiding and abetting the corrupt
payments.
	   All have pleaded not guilty.
	   The trial, before Justice Brian Keith, continues.

Boyd to stay on Jamaica roster 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Striker Walter Boyd, criticized by
coach Rene Simoes for his recent play and for missing team
appearances, will be on Jamaica's 22-man squad to the World Cup,
Simoes says.
	   Simoes said Tuesday that the temperamental Boyd apologized for
his play and for missing fitness training and team publicity
sessions.
	   ``Walter Boyd is unique and I understand that. I never ever said
he was not a talented player,'' Simoes said. ``It was always a
disciplinary problem.
	   Boyd didn't play during an embarrassing warmup match with a
Caribbean all-star team at Giants Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday.
Jamaica lost 2-1.
	   ``His mum called, his sister called, his brother called me ...
but let me tell you, it was my decision and nobody else's,'' Simoes
said.
	   The squad was leaving Jamaica for France Wednesday. It faces
Croatia on June 14 in Lins.

	   At least 13 cars derailed, piling into each other and crashing
into the base of the overpass, collapsing it. The force of the
pile-up pushed cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
buried rail cars.
	   Officials said the auto had crashed through the guardrail of the
bridge running over the train tracks.
	   Although it remained unclear, evidence at the scene suggested
that the car struck the train as it passed under the overpass. The
nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while the cars behind
derailed and jackknifed into each other.

	   THE Office of the Prime Minister has agreed to postpone until
May 2000 iTV's royalty fee payment for its operating concession
originally due next month.
	   The private television station, citing financial necessity,
initially asked for the payment to be delayed for five years and
stood firm on it Tuesday.
	   Under the contract ITV signed with the PM's Office, the station
was obliged to pay the first royalty fee of Bt300 million to the
government on July 3 of this year.
	   In its announcement Tuesday, the office said it agreed to
postpone the date for the first payment until May 12, 2000, as
resolved by the committee mediating the dispute. The dates for the
following payments will remain unchanged. The decision has yet to
be further considered by the Cabinet.
	   Jaturong Panyadilok, director of the PM's Office Legal Affairs
and Regulations Department, Tuesday said iTV executives will have
to explain if they do not accept the postponement decision.
	   ''If they do not accept the decision and want the issue to be
decided by an arbitration committee, they will have to make an
official request,'' he said.
	   Jaturong said he was worried about the decision since government
officials earlier objected to any postponement of the royalty
payment, fearing the government would lose the benefit it deserves.
	   However, he said the decision was made without any outside
pressure.
	   Managing director of iTV concessionaire Siam Infotainment Co
Ltd, Saranthorn Chutima, said Tuesday the postponement decision is
unacceptable and unfair.
	   ''We have notified the PM's Office of our platform on the
issue,'' he said.
	   He said the company wants the payment delayed for five years and
the amount originally due before the fifth year of the contract to
be paid together with the payment in the eighth year.
	   Jaturong said he preferred to have the issue settled by an
arbitration committee if the PM's Office requires a long time to
consider iTV's request for a review of the postponement.He said iTV
had run into obstacles and the expansion of its broadcasting
network was delayed by at least 18 months because of internal
conflicts between the government agencies concerned.
	   ''We are not the only party to take the blame,'' he said.

	   THE Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs yesterday denied
the government favoured the second option outlined in a
consultation paper that would abolish the two municipal councils.
	   Maureen Chan Leung Mong-lin said that of the four options
available, the second was the most controversial.
	   In its paper, the government explains the pros and cons of each
option regarding the future of regional organisations.
	   However, it does not describe the possible negative effects of
disbanding the two councils and transferring their functions to the
government and statutory bodies.
	   But Lau Siu-kai, professor of the Chinese University's Hong Kong
Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, said he believed the government
wanted to disband both bodies.
	   ``Not explaining the negative impact about dissolving the two
councils might indicate the preference of some government
officials,'' Prof Lau said.
	   Mrs Chan said it was necessary to review the existing regional
structure because it no longer matched the needs of Hong Kong.

	   THE Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Tuesday decided to pull
out of a deal to operate Microbus routes after it had worked out
the necessary arrangements to ensure the continuation of services
for commuters, a senior city official said.
	   Deputy Bangkok Governor Somjai Silsitthanukroh disclosed that
the city administration ruled against joining the management of the
Microbus services on grounds of heavier-than-expected financial
burden.
	   ''The BMA has no intention of shouldering financial commitments
such as the value added tax and other operating expenses for
passengers and private bus operators,'' he said.
	   Following this decision, the city will hold a minority stake of
one to two per cent in order to ensure a say in the standard of
services, he added.
	   In the business revitalisation plan to salvage the ailing
Microbus services, bus routes would be assigned to two companies,
Bangkok Motor Equipment Co (BAE) for 14 routes and Thonburi Motors
Assembly Co (TMA) for 22 routes, instead of one operator.
	   BAE was the original concessionaire operating the entire
Microbus service, but was forced to ask for city intervention
following sagging revenues and mounting debts.
	   Through a city-mediated deal, TMA, which assembled and leased
the microbuses to BAE, agreed to accept route concessions as
payment for the bus fleet, thus allowing BAE a fresh start in its
accounts.

	   THE Cabinet Tuesday approved Muangthai Life Assurance Ltd's
plans for setting up a new company in order to separate its general
insurance from life insurance as protection against unscrupulous
asset transfers.
	   Muangthai Insurance will take over the general insurance
business, leaving Muangthai Life to handle life insurance only. The
new company will have Bt390 million in registered capital.
	   Retained earnings from the general insurance business will also
be transferred to the new company. The Cabinet also approved a new
general insurance licence for Muangthai. Insurance policies, staff,
assets and liabilities will be separated.
	   It was the first instance of separating life and general
insurance businesses as required by the government. Thai
Reinsurance Ltd, Thai Prasit Insurance Ltd, Ocean Insurance Ltd,
South East Insurance Ltd, and American International Assurance's
local branch have yet to comply with the new law.
	   The separation of life insurance from the general insurance
business will allow regulators to monitor operators more
effectively as the two businesses are different. Life insurance is
a savings service while general insurance ispurely for risk
management.
	   South East Insurance is expected to be the second to separate
its life insurance from general insurance as the firm is preparing
to file a plan with the government shortly.
	   Meanwhile, the Cabinet also approved a plan to allow each
agricultural cooperative to hold up to 5 per cent, up from the
current limit of 0.1 per cent, of Saha Life Assurance Co, which is
planning to increase capital from Bt208.5 million to Bt500 million.
Currently, Saha Life Assurance is owned by 2,254 cooperatives which
together control 43.52 per cent of its equity.

	   STOCKS tumbled 3.6 per cent yesterday after a government
stimulus package failed to dampen fears over the economy, dealers
said.
	   The key Hang Seng Index ended off 322.55 points at 8,612.01.
Turnover was HK$6.6 billion (RM3.3 billion).
	   The index opened higher with some investors encouraged by signs
of renewed interest in the property market at sales of new
developments over the weekend.
	   But stocks quickly gave up gains on negative sentiment and a big
drop in the futures market.
	   South China Brokerage vice-chairman Howard Gorges said sales
were across the board.
	   ``There is a sense of thinking that the Government is doing too
little too late,'' Gorges said of a seven-point economic stimulus
package released on Friday.
	   ``This is being exacerbated by short-selling in Hang Seng Index
futures.''
	   Gorges said there were now a record 80,000 open short contracts,
with foreign investors looking for any signs of weakness to push
the market down still further.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang announced on Friday the economy
had shrunk two per cent in the first three months of the year in
its worst performance in 13 years.
	   Releasing the worse-than-expected figures, Tsang announced the
Government will scrap measures to stop speculation in the property
market, take action to improve bank liquidity and steps to boost
tourist numbers.

NATO accelerates other plans to reinforce Albanian, Macedonia borders With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies agreed Wednesday to
consider again whether to deploy combat troops in Albania and
Macedonia to contain the violence in neighboring Kosovo province,
but the prospect of quick action was dim.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed (with an allied force) until
we have solid, well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO
official, who asked not to be named. ``We first of all want to have
good, detailed military advice.''
	   The NATO official said getting the necessary military advice
``would take several days'' and then would have to be reviewed by
the NATO defense ministers who meet in Brussels on June 11-12.
	   Meantime, ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations agreed to
accelerate other measures that included technical and military
assistance for Albania and Macedonia. The first miliary advisors
are to leave in a matter of days.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled the violence in Kosovo, where
Serb police and army forces have stepped-up their campaign since
late May to crush the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation
Army.Kosovo.
	   More than 200 people have been killed in the southern Serb
province where 90 percent of the population are ethnic Albanians.
	   Also, NATO gave more priority to previously scheduled
small-scale joint military maneuvers in Albania and Macedonia, and
NATO's civil emergency and planning section was told to extend
immediate cooperation with U.N. officials dealing with the exodus
of Kosovo refugees.
	   Attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths of
women and children have prompted comparisons to the ethnic war in
Bosnia, where conflict spiraled into civil war in the early 1990s
as NATO allies bickered over how to contain the Balkan crisis.
	   Officials, however, rejected suggestions that NATO was again
slow off the mark by taking a cautious stance on deploying a large
alliance force in Albania and Macedonia.
	   ``NATO ... cannot do things which are not guaranteed to be
successful. We are going quickly, but we recognize there is a need
for substantive military work,'' the NATO official said.
	   NATO's Kosovo policy is guided by the belief the province should
not become independent but be given back the autonomy it once had
within the Yugoslav Republic.

	   FOUR Hong Kong cyclists got the fund-raising wheels rolling
yesterday for the Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) when they flew to
Chengdu for the first leg of their 10-week trip.
	   The four pedal-pushers' adventure will take them through the
world's highest motorable pass in Khardung-la at 5,600 metres.
	   The cycling team, all professionals aged 30 or above, will also
trek up to the Everest base camp, which will involve several days
of constant uphill cycling.
	   Lawyer Simon Black, 30, initiated the idea and friends Jacquetta
Hayes, Frances Hopwood and David Nighy agreed to join him.
	   The four are hoping to raise $390,000 for MSF (Doctors without
Borders) and wheelchair charity Motivation.
	   ``MSF and Motivation do good work in the places we will be
visiting,'' Mr Black said.
	   All the team's equipment, clothing and food supplies will be
carried on their bikes, and loads including bicycles weigh up to 30
kilograms each.
	   ``I'm still trying to find somewhere to attach my cricket bat,''
said Mr Black.
	   The four have been training since Christmas with a daily regime
that includes a morning ride up Magazine Gap Road to The Peak.
	   The trip from Lhasa to Kathmandu is 1,100 km. The second leg, to
be undertaken by Mr Black and Mr Nighy, is a further 800 km to
Ladakh.
	   Major fears for the team are possible health hazards,
bureaucracy and mechanical failures, but the team is positive.
	   ``There is a limit to the number of repairs we can carry out,
but if one of the bicycles break, we can always buy a new one,''
said Mr Black.

<TEXT>
	   He feels that from birth his destiny has been international.
Born in France and brought up in San Francisco of American and
European parents, 44-year-old Ben Barnes' appetite for
international adventure was whetted by his father's job as an oil
company executive. Lacking ``a knack for desert survival'', he
opted for a career in advertising which has led him to the current
position of president and CEO of Foote, Cone  Belding (FCB),
Asia-Pacific. He graduated in International Business from the
University of Oregon and did his masters at Thunderbird in Arizona.
McCann Erickson LA gave him the first break in advertising, after
which he moved over to Grey Advertising, working first in Venezuela
and then in Japan. He then made the fateful move to Hong Kong,
becoming managing director of Grey and later director of Grey SE
Asia. Since the end of 1994, he has been with FCB (which has a 51
per cent stake in Mumbai-based Ulka), helping design and
orchestrate the important changes that have been taking place in
the agency. He spoke to Business India's Alokananda Chakraborty
during his recent visit to Mumbai to ``unravel'' FCB's Blueprint Q
How important is India in FCB's global scheme?
	   A A lot of times my priorities are dictated by problems; in that
sense India is not a priority. But from the point of view of future
growth, India is the most important market among the 20 other
countries [in which] we are present in the Asia-Pacific region. We
have close to 500 people working with our Indian partner and the
venture contributes significantly to our Asia-Pacific profits. And
any major development at FCB will be brought to India immediately.
As a matter of fact, the FCB Blueprint was launched in the US just
about a month ago, and it is being launched in India before any of
the Asia-Pacific countries.
	   Q What is the core idea behind Blueprint? Why do we need a ``new
planning process''?
	   A Today, it is becoming increasingly difficult to describe
consumers in the typical fashion in which we categorised them
before. We now have a situation where groupings of people have
become segmented more and more on the basis of certain criteria
that go beyond standard demographic descriptions. The FCB Blueprint
is the documentation of a new, sophisticated planning process
involving tools and techniques that have been developed by FCB over
120 years of research and learning across 60 countries around the
globe. The 'new planning process' -- as it is called -- is a
strategy and creative development framework which help gain
important consumer insights. These, in turn, increase the odds of
creating ideas that sell today as well as build brand value over
time.
	   Q In recent months some of the big networks like Ammirati Puris
Lintas, Dentsu Young  Rubicam and McCann Erickson have been
rolling out proprietary tools like LinSolutions, Brand Asset
Valuator and Roadmap worldwide. Like Blueprint, these are also
supposed to generate consumer insights. What makes the fcb
blueprint any different from these?
	   A The new planning process is the core of what we at FCB call
'person-to-person advertising'. As Fairfax Cone, one of our
founders, said, ``Good advertising is written always from one
person to another. When it is aimed at millions, it rarely moves
anyone.'' In most other agencies, the creative director, the group
account director, or for that matter, the senior people who have
custodianship of the brand, are not one with the consumers. The FCB
tools ensure that the senior people are in constant communication
with the consumer in a meaningful manner. We have developed
scientific techniques for doing that.
	   Q Can you explain how these techniques work?
	   A Blueprint is a step-by-step methodology that consistently
helps develop advertising of a high quality. At the foundation of
Blueprint is a process called 'Mind  Mood', in which agency
personnel from all disciplines have conversations with consumers in
the context of their lives, as they naturally interact with
categories and brands, to uncover gut-level consumer insights. If
you delegate that task to someone else --even to professional
research outfits -- you can at best end up with second-hand
insights. And once we get an understanding of the brand, the
company, the person, and the competition through Mind  Mood, we do
a BrandLink --which helps provide an enduring view of the
relationship between the consumer and the brand. There are a host
of other techniques like these and it's only after executing all of
these that the perspective to formulate the briefs for creative,
media, and integrated functions are gained. This does not guarantee
100 per cent success, but at least we know that if we do all these
before we design a campaign, the odds against it will be minimised.

	   RICE exports during the first five months rose by 49 per cent to
2.79 million tonnes, worth Bt38.9 billion over the same period last
year, Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi announced Tuesday.
	   In terms of value, rice exports jumped by 103 per cent over the
same period last year.
	   The exports in May amounted to 420,000 tonnes, up by 8 per cent,
and worth Bt5.5 billion, a 30 per cent increase when compared to
the same period last year. Thailand exports 500,000 tonnes of rice
a month.
	   Supachai said the lower export growth in May came after
importers delayed shipments, in particular, to Indonesia which is
facing serious economic crisis and political turmoil, and the
Philippines, which just concluded its national election and was
awaiting the new government's rice policy.
	   Moreover, low grade rice was facing severe competition because
output from China, an important rival, was flooding the market.
Since the Chinese sold their rice at a very competitive price
compared to Thailand, buyers were placing more orders from China,
he said.
	   Although the demand for rice in the region has fallen, its
trading in theworld market was still high, and is expected to reach
22.10 million tonnes. Thailand was eyeing a 27.08 per cent share of
the total trade, making it the world's largest exporter.
	   Vietnam, another major exporter, has delayed its export shipment
in order to cover the domestic shortage, which has led to countries
in the Middle East and Africa accelerating their imports. In
addition, Japan has opened its market for rice imports under a
commitment to the World Trade Organisation.
	   Supachai revealed that Thailand's export level would be 400,000
to 500,000 tonnes in June to July this year. This will help shore
up the second crop rice price.
	   Meanwhile, the Thai Rice Mills Association has reported that
rice prices in the Bangkok market were rising due to low supply.
Many Iranian vessels are waiting to load rice at Bangkok Port.

	   THE Cabinet Tuesday added Bt50 billion to the 1998 budget
deficit to compensate for losses by state-run Bangkok Mass Transit
Authority (BMTA) and State Railway of Thailand (SRT).
	   The stimulus package is aimed at boosting the expenditure of
government agencies by Bt40 billion and of state enterprises by
Bt10 billion to provide for the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand's Ratchaburi power plant project and a Petroleum Authority
of Thailand gas pipeline project. This will increase the 1998
fiscal budget to Bt850 billion.
	   The plan comes ahead of expected International Monetary Fund
approval on June 10 of Thailand's fourth quarterly commitment to
economic reforms outlined in the US$17.2 billion multilateral
rescue package.
	   The fourth letter of intent, signed by the Cabinet last week,
allows a widening of the government's budget deficit from 2 per
cent of gross domestic product to 3 per cent in fiscal 1997-98.
	   For the BMTA, the government will compensate for a Bt3.19
billion operating loss in 1996 and 1997 compared to an accumulated
loss of Bt6.18 billion since 1993. In 1998, the BMTA is expected to
record a Bt2.2 billion loss.
	   A government spokesman said the government must absorb some of
the BMTA's loss because it is in serious financial trouble with a
massive debt burden and very little liquidity. The BMTA cannot
boost its revenue to cover rising operating costs due to
restrictions on raising fares.
	   The government has not allowed the BMTA to boost its fares in
line with its operating costs to avoid impacting to low-income
earners. However, the financial strain has caused BMTA to default
on debts and will eventually hit service quality.
	   The government also ordered the BMTA to immediately prepare its
privatisation plans for submission to the Finance Ministry.
	   Meanwhile, the government will provide an additional Bt38
million in compensation for the SRT to Bt1.39 billion for fiscal
1998.
	   Other expenses are Bt4.75 billion contributed to the Social
Security Fund, and Bt4.73 billion in welfare payments for civil
servants, which the government earlier suspended.
	   The spokesman said this would strengthen the fund's stability to
cope with the burden imposed by the Social Security Act BE 2533,
such as extending compensation for unemployed workers from six to
12 months.
	   Moreover, employees have been permitted to reduce their
contribution from 1.5 per cent of their salaries to 1 per cent. In
fiscal 1999, the government will contribute Bt3.5 billion to the
fund from a total Bt12 billion.

	   CUSTOMERS who had a call girl round to their flats found the
price had increased 10 times after they had the service, a court
heard yesterday.
	   Tong Kam-wai, 25, allegedly threatened to cut clients' hands
off, beat them up or set fire to their flats to force them to pay
the inflated bills.
	   He was also accused of claiming to be a member of the 14 K triad
society.
	   In the District Court, Tong denied one count of being a member
of a triad society, one count of living on the earnings of
prostitution of others, and seven counts of blackmail.
	   Prosecutor Hayson Tse told the court that Lam Wai-on was
answering an advertisement when he made a call seeking sexual
services in September last year.
	   A prostitute went to his house in Tsing Yi and collected $600
before they had sexual intercourse.
	   After having the service, the prostitute made a call and gave
the line to Mr Lam. Mr Lam then found that he was talking to Tong
and was asked to pay an extra $7,000 or else he would be chopped.
	   He paid another $700 cash but later made a report to police. The
trial continues.

	   THE national badminton team have had a good, long rest after
their fine display at the Thomas Cup Finals. The one-week holiday
ended yesterday and it was back to the grind for them.
	   To them, the Thomas Cup is now history. Their next objective is
to put up another superb show at the Commonwealth Games in
September.
	   The players did not show any sign of slowing down when they
returned to training, much to the delight of national coach Morten
Frost Hansen.
	   None of the players, including veteran Cheah Soon Kit, had any
difficulty getting through the gruelling three-hour training
session in the morning and another two in the evening.
	   The only setback, which Frost said was minor, was that doubles
ace Yap Kim Hock was still not ready for training because of the
nagging shoulder injury he suffered at the Thomas Cup.
	   Yap was the only senior shuttler who skipped training yesterday.
	   The Danish coach said he wants to ensure that the players put up
a strong challenge in the Malaysian Open, Brunei Open and Singapore
Open in August.
	   Except for doubles specialist Choong Tan Fook, the other
national players will not be taking part in next week's Perlis
Open.
	   ``The Malaysian Open is more important and the players should
not exert themselves before the tournament, like taking part in the
Perlis Open,''
	   said Frost.
	   ``Furthermore, right after the Malaysian Open, they will be
playing in the Brunei Open.''
	   Frost expects the national players to have a good run in both
tournaments. There is a lot at stake as they will be jostling for
places in the Commonwealth Games squad.
	   ``They know the rules. Only the best will be selected. So I
expect a good showing from all the shuttlers,'' said Frost.

	   THE Cabinet Tuesday gave approval to the Port Authority of
Thailand to borrow Bt8 billion from the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) to build the second phase of the first
stage of Laem Chabang Commercial Port.
	   The PAT had signed a contract with Italian-Thai Development Plc
to build basic infrastructure with an investment of Bt8.4 billion.
	   Gas purchase delay denied THE Petroleum Authority of Thailand
has denied a report that it plans to negotiate for a delay in the
purchase of gas from the Thailand-Malaysia Joint Development Area.
	   ''PTT currently has no intention to request any extension or
delay in the time frame during which it would commence taking
delivery of gas,'' said director of corporate relations Somkiert
Tansamrit in a statement.
	   BIS sees no export growth THE latest report from the
Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows
that sharp devaluation of several Asian currencies in Asia will not
spur export growth or economic recovery in the region.
	   In its quarterly report, BIS said Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand, where the damage is the most serious, would still face
adjustment difficulties in their economies and societies.
	   Although international credit-rating agencies have factored in
the implications of the region's crisis, the benefits from
increased exports will be limited.
	   De Beers launches local diamond promotion IN AN effort to
support Thailand's diamond industry during the crisis, De Beers has
launched an integrated communications campaign called ''Brilliant
Diamond, Brilliant Thai''.
	   The campaign is designed to be in line with the government's
policy encouraging Thai people to buy Thai products. The
promotional activity will continue well into 1999.
	   De Beers is the world's leading diamond producer and diamond
mining expert. It has representatives in 34 countries to promote
sales of diamond jewellery.
	   ''As the world's fifth-largest cutting and polishing centre,
Thailand is recognised as one of the major players in the diamond
industry. Thai people should be very proud to wear diamond
jewellery because Thai craftsmanship contributes so much to the
beauty and the brilliance of diamonds,'' said Jonathon S Pudney, De
Beers marketing director for Thailand, Taiwan and Korea.
	   After the country was hit by the economic downturn, the domestic
market has shrunk, creating concern about the health of the
industry that earns top foreign currency and supports thousands of
employees.
	   According to research conducted recently, Thai consumers are
still able to afford diamond jewellery but they are reluctant to
buy because they think it might be inappropriate when the economic
is in such a dire state.
	   ''The fact is, when you buy a diamond in Thailand you are
helping the industry and the workers,'' Pudney said.
	   IT giants to form open network THE Public Communication Networks
Group of Siemens AG, British Telecom, DGMS Telecom, Microsoft and
Nortel have initiated a new working group focused on developing a
specification for an open network interface that will widen the
horizons of intelligence in networks.
	   This will enable developers in the IT and telecommunications
industries to generate a new range of applications that access and
use functionality resident in public and/or private communications
networks while maintaining the integrity, performance, and security
of those networks.
	   The working group plans to release the first version of the
specification later in 1998. In the same timeframe, the group plans
to use a sample application to demonstrate the functionality and
business value of this specification.
	   Thailand to host secretaries THE Women Secretaries Association
of Thailand (WSAT) will host the 13th Congress of Secretaries in
Asia from Sept 20 to 26 at the Nikko Hotel, Bangkok. The congress
will attract over 500 secretaries from the 14 member countries as
will as observers from America, South America, Canada, the Pacific
Region and Europe.
	   WSAT said it was confident that the congress, which is supported
by the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Thai Airways International
Public Co and Thai Fuji Xerox Co, will be good for the country's
reputation and will benefit the country financially.
	   Sukanya Nimmanheminda, WSAT/ASA president and chairperson of the
13th Congress Organising Committee, said the congress is held every
two years and alternates among the 14 member countries of the
Association of Secretaries in Asia. The main objective of the
congress will be to disseminate the latest information and trends
in the secretarial profession to members through various well-known
speakers. The congress also acts as a forum for secretaries to
exchange their knowledge and experience, and learn about each
other's cultures.
	   Paclink and TTT hook up PACLINK (Thailand) Co Ltd has appointed
Thai Telephone and Telecommunication Plc (TTT), the operator of a
provincial telephone line project, as its dealer to boost sales in
the provinces.
	   A company executive said Paclink was emphasising the provincial
market because there was plenty of room for growth there.
Currently, the company has a total of 240,000 subscribers
nationwide and over 100 dealers.
	   In the future, the company expects to form an alliance with TTT
to provide call forwarding service for Paclink and TTT
subscribers. Details are currently under negotiation.

	   TO prevent volatility in the financial markets, the Bank of
Thailand has re-adopted a high-interest rate policy to control
speculative baht trading.
	   The repurchase rate Tuesday was jacked up by 50 basis points to
18 per cent.
	   MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said
Tuesday the central bank is prepared to raise short-term interest
rates to tackle exchange rate volatility.
	   ''A high interest rate policy is still necessary. The rate needs
to be raised to attract capital inflows during the period that the
dollar/baht exchange rate is weakened. I believe that [one or two
days after the rate is jacked up] the situation will improve,'' he
said.
	   Short-term rates would directly affect the exchange rate, he
explained, as they would force swap rates up, thereby discouraging
baht sales.
	   His comments followed the sharp depreciation of the baht against
the US dollar since late last week. The dollar/baht exchange rate
ended morning trading at Bt42.55-Bt42.65, down from Bt40 at the end
of last week. The baht ended the day at Bt42.20 per dollar, a 1.56
per cent drop from Bt41.55 on Friday.
	   Dealers said rising fears over a regional economic recession as
well as the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen dragged the
Thai currency down.
	   Chatu Mongol said the weakened baht is driven by natural causes.
The cause is explicable and amid low trading volumes, the
dollar/baht rate follows market expectations on the baht and other
Asian currencies.
	   He said the fall of regional currencies, particularly the
Japanese yen, were due to the low and negative growths recorded
throughout the region. The baht cannot fight because 40 per cent of
Thailand's gross domestic product comes from international trade.
	   Chatu Mongol said there will be intervention by the authorities
only after the problem is solved as Thailand does not have
sufficient reserves to fight the market whose foreign exchange
trading volume is about US$1.5 trillion.
	   ''Before intervening, we must make sure the volume is low. All
would be drowned when swimming in a direction different to the
tide. Similarly, we could not resist [the tide],'' he said.
	   Yet, Chatu Mongol said the short-term rate hike would not affect
the long-term rate because short-term interest rates are a means of
controlling the exchange rate. Higher interest rates are expected
to control speculative baht trading.

	   ONE reason for the government's plan to take back the job of
ensuring food safety and environmental hygiene from the two
municipal councils is to enhance co-ordination with international
bodies.
	   That was the explanation given by Deputy Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs Maureen Chan Leung Mong-lin on a radio
program yesterday.
	   ``Public health concerns the people, the issue must be dealt
with, hence we prefer it be taken care of by the government,'' she
explained.
	   It is understood that the bird flu crisis in the second half of
last year and this year's red tide crisis gave rise to the move.
	   The two crises sparked public criticism of the lack of
co-ordination between the municipal authorities and the relevant
government departments.
	   On Monday Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen
Ming-yeung explained that besides the two municipal councils, the
Health and Welfare Bureau, Department of Health, Agriculture and
Fisheries Department and Economic Services Bureau all perform
duties related to the safety of imported poultry.
	   ``There has been so much criticism from the public that we want
to centralise the work so as to improve efficiency and the ability
to respond to emergencies,'' Mr Suen said.
	   Mrs Chan said the government would also improve co-ordination
with international bodies like the World Health Organisation.
	   ``Some of the crises that happened lately showed that the
proposed arrangement would be more appropriate as it could ensure
faster and better assistance from some international bodies,'' she
said.
	   In reply to the demand by pro-democracy parties that all
appointed seats in the regional organisations be abolished, Mrs
Chan said the government had not yet reached any decision on the
issue.
	   But she stressed that some favoured the retention of ex-officio
seats because the two municipal councils needed opinions from
experts.
	   Meanwhile, Provisional Urban Councillor Joseph Chan Yuek-sut
said the government's formation of a Steering Committee on Healthy
Living was a ``plot'' to disempower the municipal councils ahead of
the government consultation.
	   ``The reason that the government set up such a committee is
because they want to withdraw our power in advance,'' Mr Chan told
a council Standing Committee meeting.
	   Councillor Lee Wing-tat asked why council chairman Ronald Leung
Ding-bong was appointed a member of the steering committee. Chief
Secretary for Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang heads the
panel that will promote healthy living over the next three years.
``I think you have to clarify if you are invited into the committee
as our chairman or in your own personal capacity,'' he said.
	   Dr Leung said he had no answer to the question.

	   THERE'S a new imperialism abroad and it is being waged through
the media.
	   The latest is a blatant attempt by the English to hijack the
2002 World Cup from Japan and South Korea.
	   The sniping, jibing and jiving have become an intolerable threat
to Asian and Third World interests. And sporting stability.
	   The underhanded methods employed are certainly unsporting.
	   But that is to be expected of a nation who appear to have lost
all sense of propriety together with their sporting excellence and
domination. The Brits are, after all, now also-rans in cricket,
rugby, tennis, football and most other sport.
	   The world has to deal with this threat before they become
reckless, and irresponsible, if they haven't already made a mockery
of sportsmanship.
	   The unfair sniping at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games
through exaggerated reports, often outright lies, was so bad that
it appeared to be an orchestrated effort. A flagrant attack to
discredit Malaysia, the first Asian nation to host the Games.
	   The half-truths, slander and distortions about the haze, drug
laws, etc, were hurtful but the truth has prevailed and the
Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) themselves have lashed out at
these reports.
	   The lie as reported by the Observer's sports editor Alan Hubbard
that `British athletes will be flogged for smoking dope in KL' is
just one case in point.
	   But the latest attempt by the British Press at daylight robbery,
allegedly aided and abetted by their government, to snatch the 2002
World Cup was met with outrage by Japan and South Korea, Fifa and
the international community.
	   This brings into question the very essence of British integrity
and honour although their actions during the days when they ruled
two-thirds of the world distinctly showed their disdain for both.
	   Fifa, the world soccer's governing body, dismissed speculation
that Japan and South Korea could pull out of staging the 2002 World
Cup.
	   The Fifa statement was released following a report in the
tabloid Daily Express which quoted British Sports Minister Tony
Banks as saying England were preparing to replace Japan and South
Korea as 2002 host.
	   Banks was quoted as saying he had discussed the possibility with
Fifa vice president Lennart Johansson.
	   ``This is an eventuality which Johansson has raised,'' Banks was
quoted as saying. ``He thinks Japan and Korea might have
difficulties. We are the only nation equipped to organise and put
on a World Cup Finals at very short notice. We are ready and
willing to step in and the football authorities know that.''
	   Johansson, chairman of the World Cup organising committee,
described the speculation as `absurd and completely unfounded'.
	   ``There is absolutely no doubt that Japan and South Korea will
organise the first World Cup in Asia,'' Johansson said in a
statement. ``Preparations are going ahead as scheduled and Fifa are
in full agreement with both of the organising committees.''
	   What is it with the Brits? Can't they bear to see an Asian
nation or a former colony make the grade or is it something more
insidious?
	   Banks later dismissed the report as `entirely fictitious'. He
denied having discussed taking over the 2002 World Cup with
Johansson.
	   But German Football Federation president Egidius Braun strongly
criticised the role he believes British Prime Minister Tony Blair
himself is playing in England's bid to replace the hosts for the
2002 World Cup.
	   Braun told German radio that he was disappointed in England's
bid to take over from financially-troubled Japan and South Korea
and said he suspected Blair was a key player in the move.
	   Braun said: ``It is not a very noble and correct attitude and
not very gentlemanlike. As president of a federation, I would be
thinking more in terms of how to help our Japanese and South Korean
friends.
	   ``I don't know the exact reasons which are motivating them, but
I know Tony Blair is behind it all.''
	   A damning indictment indeed. But not surprising, seeing as how
the English FA reneged on an agreement with their German
counterparts to support Germany's bid for the 2006 World Cup by
joining in the bid themselves.
	   Where is the much vaunted British sense of fairplay and
sportsmanship?
	   Sport, after all, is not supposed to know boundaries and
prejudices.
	   Where is the goodwill, the spirit which exemplifies the
Commonwealth?
	   Perhaps it is a myth like the Commonwealth itself.
	   But then, it is all so typical of the jingoism practised by the
English Press which, lacking a Princess Diana to hound, now pick on
foreigners to sell their newspapers. Driven, no doubt, by that
xenophobic smugness and insularity that makes the English think
they are superior to the rest of the world.
	   Who can forget the grossness they displayed during Euro '96 in
insulting the Germans. It got so bad that the Labour and
Conservative MPs had to deplore `the frenzy of jingoistic, notably
anti-German nonsense in the tabloid Press'.
	   In Germany, the broadsheet Suddeutsche Zeitung consoled its
readers by explaining that The Sun and other tabloids are `read by
people who don't give a toss about who runs the country, as long as
she has big breasts'.
	   That best sums up the British Press and why we should pay scant
attention to them.
	   The trouble is they act as if Britain were still a world power
when it cannot even muster a decent cricket or rugby team to take
on the colonial boys.
	   Even the biggest stars in the English League today are
foreigners and Premier League champions Arsenal are managed by
Frenchman Arsene Wenger.
	   And Britain pride themselves in being home of the beautiful
game.
	   Eric Cantona of France became a tabloid celebrity when he
responded to xenophobic abuse by kicking a spectator in the chest.
And Manchester United wouldn't have won the Double without him.
	   One way to retaliate would be to not support England's bid for
the 2006 World Cup. Losing that to Germany would be as big a blow
as seeing the Germans win Euro '96 on English soil.
	   Just as we should snub any attempts by the English to send
sub-standard teams to the Commonwealth Games.
	   For that appears to be the latest English trend. Beaten in
cricket, in rugby and even football, they have taken to sending
below-par teams on tours to save whatever pride is left in them.
Like the rugby tour Down Under which has got the Aussies fuming.
	   Australian rugby bosses Dick McGruther and John O'Neill have
blasted the England's Rugby Football Union (RFU) for allowing
players to withdraw from the tour despite being fit enough to play
for their club sides.
	   O'Neill has even threatened to review future incoming tours of
British sides.
	   So all is not fair or right with the Brits, who appear to be
using underhanded methods to achieve what they cannot do on level
playing fields. It's the old colonial bigotry and hypocrisy of
double standards all over again.
	   It leaves the same bad taste as it undermines mankind's ability
to share sport without rancor and division.

	   SINGAPORE -- Arianespace, the world's leading satellite
launcher, has reacted calmly to Asia's financial crisis, saying
that such crises in other regions had in the end resulted in
rewarding recoveries.
	   ''Although we are not economists, we are all obliged to make
economic judgments. Our judgment is that there is every reason to
expect a rebound in the region's economies,'' said Jean-Marie
Luton, the company's chairman and CEO in a speech at CommunicAsia
98/NetworkAsia 98 trade fair.
	   He pointed out that Asia-Pacific had the world's largest
population and that telecommunications was always going to be
essential.
	   ''People need telecommunications in their hearts,'' he said.
	   Investment in satellite communications is a long-term plan. Some
satellite providers and some countries have delayed the investment,
but they still realise that it will take them at least five years
to have the investment in a complete service, the top boss said.
	   ''It makes sense to continue the satellite projects and when the
economy has picked up, the service is there,'' he said.
	   Arianespace controls the largest share of the business
worldwide. Currently, it has secured orders to launch a total of 40
satellites. Seven of them are for Asia-Pacific: India's Insat 2E,
Indonesia's Telkom-1, Japan's Superbird-4, Korea's Koreasat-3,
Singapore's ST-1, and Laos' L-Star A  B.
	   Following the economic crisis, some projects have been put on
hold, including L-Star. However, Arianspace claimed there had been
no cancellations.
	   This year, the Europe-based satellite launcher will put up two
satellites -- ST-1 and Insat 2E. The L-Star satellite project,
which has faced financial problems, is expected to emerge free of
those problems and could be launched into space next year,
according to Arianspace.
	   ''Shareholders and the operator of L-Star are working out their
plans. We will be informed of an exact date for the launch later,''
said Richard Bowles, director of the Singapore Asean office.
	   Arianspace remains optimistic that it will be able to increase
its market share in Asia-Pacific from the current 50 per cent to 60
per cent in the next seven to eight years, according to Ralph
Werner Jaeger, senior vice president for commercial and
international affairs.
	   ''Our current order book shows seven for the region to be
launched over the next two years. The combined order books for our
competition is eight. So we have just under half of Asia's
satellites currently on order,'' Luton said in his speech.
	   The company executives said they had assisted all customers
technically and financially.
	   ''The cost for launching a satellite will not be more expensive,
but the speed for getting the satellite into its orbital slot will
be faster. This will help customers to use their satellite
faster,'' Luton said.
	   Launching without failures is one big advantage for customers.
Luton said that such complete launches had enabled the space
insurance market to become very profitable and had led to a
dramatic fall in the cost of insurance.
	   ''For our new Ariane 5, Arianspace is also offering a free
re-launch in case of a failure of the new launcher,'' Luton said.
	   In a separate development, Thailand's satellite operator,
Shinawatra Satellite Plc, has introduced a new service to
facilitate the Internet business, called Thaicom Direct.
	   The new service will enable Internet speed via Thaicom-3's
C-Band transponder at 8 megabites per second, compared with the
fastest telephone line link currently at 56 kilobites per second.
	   Also, the company is planning to launch another high-speed
satellite link called Data Broadcasting Network, which will help
Internet users to store all data in hard disk for instant
retrieval. The stored data could be transmitted via a television
system using Digital Satellite Television (DSTV).

Russian's say no evidence Einstein friend was Soviet spy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian spy agency said Wednesday it has no
evidence that a woman romantically involved with Albert Einstein
worked for Soviet intelligence.
	   Nine of the scientist's recently discovered letters reveal
Einstein's strong feelings for Margarita Konenkova, a Soviet woman
with whom he had a wartime love affair.
	   Konenkova was identified as a spy in ``Special Tasks,'' the
memoirs of Soviet spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov, published in 1995.
	   But the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Gen. Yuri
Kobaladze, told the Interfax news agency it has no evidence she
worked with Soviet intelligence.
	   ``Soviet intelligence had nothing to do with Einstein,''
Kobaladze said.
	   A duty officer at the agency, a successor to the KGB, refused to
comment Wednesday when contacted by The Associated Press.
	   The letters indicate Konenkova accomplished the task she had
reportedly been given in Moscow: introducing the famous physicist
to Moscow's vice consul in New York. But the diplomat apparently
failed to change Einstein's opinions on the Soviet Union.
	   Sotheby's auction house plans to sell Einstein's letters,
obtained from one of Konenkova's descendants, on June 26.
	   Kobaladze said it was possible the allegations about Konenkova
surfaced this week for the purpose of ``adding the element of
sensation to the upcoming auction and inflating the price of the
love letters,'' Interfax said.
	   The letters were written between November 1945 and July 1946,
just after Konenkova returned to Moscow.

	   The struggling Kanjanapas family, Bangkok Land Plc's major
shareholder, will find it difficult to revive their ambition to
become Thailand's premier property developer. Achara Deboonme
writes.
	   Bangkok Land was set up in 1989 when Thailand saw the start of
an economic boom which drove domestic demand to levels unseen
before. The Kanjanapas family's decision was proved right later,
when over 300,000 housing units were sold each year during
1990-1993.
	   Yet, there were both real and artificial demands and all
property companies including Bangkok Land realised that in late
1994.
	   Then, not all buyers could be have completed units transferred
to them, and that meant the developers could not receive the
remainder of the sales price. It was normal for the highest
downpayment to be just 25 per cent of the cost of a property.
	   It was predictable what would happen: property developers would
see their inventories rise and earnings shrink.
	   Bangkok Land posted a net profit of only Bt661 million in the
1994 fiscal year ended March 1995, a sharp fall from Bt5.03 billion
in the previous fiscal year, or an 87 per cent decline.
	   Anant Kanjanapas, chief executive officer of the company,
appeared at a press conference on May 6, 1995 and announced that
his company would delay all development projects due to cashflow
problems.
	   The development delay was not the only thing depressing Anant,
who is the key man of the family's business in Thailand. Bangkok
Land was a very aggressive developer.In 1993, after most of its
units launched were sold out, Bangkok Land was encouraged to forge
a bigger plan. Anant announced the company would launch 10 projects
in the same year requiring a total investment of around Bt10
billion or Bt1 billion for each project.
	   Anant shocked other businessemen in the property development and
other industries with an announcement that the company had fixed
its advertising budget for the year at 3 per cent of total
investment value. Though the percentage was not high, it still
meant Bt300 million would be spent. It was an usually large amount,
even for the likes of such industrial conglomerates as Siam Cement
Plc.
	   Land  Houses Plc, today regarded as the strongest property
developer, was at that time considered the second biggest developer
to Bangkok Land, yet its advertising budget was less than Bt100
million.
	   Colourful double-page spreads in newspapers were the norm for
B-land. Billboards were also employed, but Bangkok Land spent more
thriftly on television ads.
	   Yet, the advertisements mainly brought pent-up demand, leading
to a disaster for the company.
	   In the 1996 fiscal year, though the company did not launch any
new projects, its inventory rose from Bt23 billion in total value a
year earlier to Bt24.4 billion. The figure climbed to Bt25 billion
in 1997 as many sold units were not transferred to buyers.
	   Bangkok Land is now in serious financial trouble. It has
difficulty finding money to repay short-term loans which stood at
Bt21 billion at the end of the 1997 fiscal year. Its situation
looks bad with sales in the 1997 fiscal year amounting to only
Bt3.17 billion compared with the cost of sales of Bt3.35 billion.
	   Bangkok Land's affiliate Tanayong Plc is in no better position.
Most of its 14 high-rise condominium buildings on Bangna-Trat Road
remain unsold. The only funding source of the company comes from
Bangkok Transit Service Plc, its subsidiary.Against the Kanjanapas
family's ambition to become the biggest property developer in
Thailand, its breathing space is being narrowed and the situation
is not expected to improve in the foreseeable future.

At least 70 dead in high-speed German train crash

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany after colliding with an automobile
that had plunged off an overpass. At least 70 people were killed
and 200 injured.
	   The Hamburg-bound train collided with the auto at 200 kilometers
(125 miles) an hour as it approached the station in Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover just before 11 a.m.,
officials said. The train was carrying about 300 passengers.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991, and the deadliest rail crash in western
Germany since World War II.
	   At least 13 cars derailed, piling into each other and crashing
into the base of the overpass, collapsing it. The force of the
pile-up pushed cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
buried rail cars.
	   Officials said the auto had crashed through the guardrail of the
bridge running over the train tracks.
	   Although it remained unclear, evidence at the scene suggested
that the car struck the train as it passed under the overpass. The
nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while the cars behind
derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany'burg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

<TEXT>
	   Al-NIBAI, Iraq (AP) _ United Nations weapons inspectors searched
through reeds and sand dunes Wednesday for missing missile parts in
a bid to verify Iraq's claims that it has buried all its biological
and chemical missile warheads.
	   Wearing protective suits, masks, boots and gloves, some 27
experts under German Jean Jano used metal detectors and other
equipment in their search at Al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
north of Baghdad.
	   Others supervised an earth-moving machine as it uncovered the
nose cone of a missile warhead. ``This belongs to a conventional
warhead,'' shouted an Iraqi engineer.
	   In 1991, Iraq chose to destroy a great number of its long-range
missiles and bury them rather than declare them to U.N inspectors,
which has complicated the verification process.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed its entire arsenal, and that it is
impossible to account for every warhead. The United Nations says it
cannot take Iraq's word.
	   ``We hope that this work will help to settle some of the still
outstanding issues concerning the missile warheads,'' Jano, 61,
told The Associated Press. It is the first time a Western news
organization was allowed at a weapons search site.
	   Jano refused to say how far his team has progressed in verifying
Iraq's claims, or how many parts it has collected so far.
	   But Brig. Ismael Saeed Ahmad, the Iraqi official who supervised
the 1991 destruction and burial at al-Nibai, said U.N. monitors
have so far recovered enough parts to account for 49 biological and
chemical warheads. He did not say how many were buried.
	   As for conventional warheads, only 10 remain unaccounted for, he
told the AP later in Baghdad.
	   The area where Iraq buried its missiles is vast. Experts with
magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors placed small, red flags on
the ground to mark the next dig.
	   ``We've with us some of the latest state-of-the-art high-tech
equipment,'' said Vincent Murphy, a 69-year-old geophysicist from
Boston. ``It is all digitally recorded. The data is brought back in
the recorder to one of the vehicles and downloaded to the laptop.''
	   Advanced equipment is needed because satellite images cannot
penetrate the soil at al-Nibai, he said.
	   Jano said inspectors found ``aluminum canisters that are used
for chemical agents and some stainless steel canisters ... used for
biological agents.''
	   The excavation is scheduled to end June 18.
	   Jano said another team will arrive in Baghdad soon to analyze
the findings, now stored at Taji, a military camp 20 kilometers (12
miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Senior Iraqi officers looked on as the experts searched. The
Iraqis refuse to wear safety gear, saying the pieces of scrap
underground are non-toxic.
	   U.N. monitors burn their suits every day, and wash their hands
and feet in a bleach solution before leaving the site.
	   Accounting for special warheads is one of the main hurdles in
Iraq's efforts to declare itself clean of prohibited missiles with
ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Ahmed, the Iraqi brigadier, claimed all such missiles have now
been accounted for.
	   In addition, U.N. inspectors are believed to have accounted for
817 of the 819 Scud missiles in Iraq's arsenal.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of its weapons of
mass destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not lift the
sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait.

Radical Islamic group attacks anti-nuclear activists

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A violent attack by 30 Muslim
radicals threatening death to anti-nuclear activists outraged
Pakistan's human rights groups, who issued a statement Wednesday
demanding the government rein in an ``over-excited pro-bomb
lobby''.
	   On Tuesday, about 30 young men waving placards and carrying
banners stormed into a room where the Pakistan-India People's Forum
for Peace and Democracy _ a group pushing dialogue between the two
uneasy neighbors _ was holding a news conference that ``strongly
condemned'' last month's nuclear testing by Pakistan and India.
	   Two people were hurt, including an organizer and a longtime
peace activist and nuclear physicist, A.H. Nayyar.
	   ``It was pre-planned . . . it wasn't random violence,'' said
Sameena Ahmed, a defense analyst and forum member. ``Why use
terror? it's an old tactic here ... to stop the process of dialogue
and debate.''
	   ``It's not going to stop the debate ... it's not going to go
underground,'' Ahmed said.
	   Pakistan said it conducted five nuclear tests last Thursday and
a sixth last Saturday _ one-upping India, which tested five devices
three weeks ago. In both Pakistan and India, their respective
testing was greeted with jubilation.
	   A survey conducted by Gallup Pakistan immediately prior to the
testing showed 70 percent of Pakistanis wanted their government to
match India and test a device of its own.
	   Most other countries have expressed dismay and threatened
sanctions. Pakistan's right-wing religious groups denounced the
West for its criticism burning U.S. as well as Indian flags.
	   With the nuclear issue generating such strong emotions, the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan urged the government to protect
freedom of expression.
	   ``The fact that the people of Pakistan are worried about their
future cannot be denied,'' said Asma Jehangir, a spokesperson for
the Human Rights group. ``If there are fascist elements in society
it is the responsibility of the government to keep an eye on them
and not permit their crossing the limits.''
	   The leaders of the attack belonged to the militant wing of the
Jamaat-e-Islami party, a small, powerful religious party that
hardly gets 3 percent of the vote, but has significant street
appeal.

Mitsubishi Motors to stop production of Jeeps in Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Wednesday that it will
stop production of Jeep models 45 years after the commercial debut
of the rugged four-wheel-drive vehicles in Japan.
	   The Tokyo-based automaker will make its last Jeep in August,
said a company spokesman, explaining the decision was made because
the vehicles do not meet new environmental and safety standards.
	   To commemorate the Jeep's 45th anniversary in Japan, Mitsubishi
Motors plans to sell a total of 300 ``limited edition'' classic
Jeep models, said the spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Mitsubishi has sold about 200,000 Jeeps in Japan _ mostly to the
government _ since it was first granted a license to make them in
1953.
	   The Jeep was originally developed for the U.S. military in 1940
by Willys-Overland and is now made in the United States by Chrysler
Corp. Production of the first U.S. commercial Jeep began in 1946.

Amoco, Repsol to build LNG plants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Amoco's Trinidad subsidiary and
Repsol of Spain have announced an alliance intended to triple
liquified natural gas production in Trinidad.
	   David Wight, president of Amoco Trinidad, said Tuesday that
Atlantic LNG will build two new LNG plants by 2002, in addition to
one under construction.
	   Wight said the LNG expansion would involve an additional dlrs 3
billion in direct investment in what is already the largest single
investment in the English-speaking Caribbean.
	   Repsol will commit to purchase close to 5 million tons of LNG
annually to supply its markets in Spain, while up to 25 percent of
the increased production will be marketed in the United States,
Brazil and the Caribbean.
	   The deal, which must be approved by the government, gives Repsol
the opportunity to purchase between 10 and 30 percent of Amoco's
Trinidad assets and sets the stage for the companies to cooperate
in Brazil's energy market.
	   ``It's estimated that the (Trinidad) government could earn in
the range of dlrs 6 billion over 20 years in taxes and royalty
revenue'' as a result of the deal, Wight said.
	   Repsol, through its Enagas subsidiary, had previously agreed to
take 40 percent of production from a 3 million-ton per year LNG
plant under construction. The other 60 percent will go to Cabot
LNG's markets in New England. Cabot is a 10 percent stakeholder in
Atlantic LNG.
	   Amoco and Repsol hold 34 percent and 20 percent, respectively,
of the first plant, which begins production next year. They are
also partners in two hydrocarbon blocks off Trinidad's east and
south coasts.
	   As part of the alliance, Amoco will allow Repsol to purchase 10
percent of its production assets in Trinidad for an undisclosed
sum.

	   IF you thought Sabah are a spent force in Malaysian soccer,
you'd better think again.
	   Despite a slow start, no thanks to the row between Sabah FA and
the Sabah Sports Council, the Premier One team seem to have shaken
off their problems and are making headway again.
	   Under the guidance of Ken Shellito, Sabah may not be true
Premier One contenders but they cannot be discounted in the race
for the Malaysia Cup and FA Cup.
	   Underestimating them would be a big mistake.
	   When asked about their resurgence, Shellito said he is extremely
happy with the way his side have been shaping up over the last two
months.
	   However, he said Sabah prefer to keep their darkhorse tag this
season.
	   ``No one gave us a chance because everyone was preoccupied with
what happened off the field. But we are coming along nicely and we
are out to play more consistently,'' said Shellito, after watching
his side edge Selangor 1-0 at Shah Alam Stadium last Saturday.
	   The problem for Shellito now is finding a potent striker with
regular Suharmin Yusuf struggling. Suharmin has been shooting
blanks.
	   Sabah are second only to Olympic 2000 in having the worst
scoring records in the League, finding the net 10 times in 11
matches. Olympic 2000 have scored only nine.
	   David Rocastle remains Sabah's topscorer and that is only three
to his credit. And the the former England international is not even
a specialist striker.
	   ``We are doing all right but there is always room for
improvement. This win over Selangor was good. It will help us play
better and set us in a good position as we will have more home
matches in the second round,'' said Shellito.
	   Shellito admits he is keen to continue his good run against his
former side. ``I have to admit beating Selangor at home is never
easy. However, I have a great record against them and that really
cheers me up.''

	   US-BASED Amway (Thailand) Ltd, one of the world's major direct
selling firms, is negotiating with an unidentified international
bank to form a strategic partnership to enter Thailand's mortgage
financing and leasing market, the first Asian market in the US
firm's plan for diversification into financial services.
	   Amway, which controls 140,000 sales representatives in Thailand,
--one of the country's largest sales forces -- started financial
services for home and automobiles in the US market and later
expanded these services to Australia. Expansion into financial
services is also planned for other Asian markets, including Japan,
Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   Amway (Thailand) general manager Preecha Prakobkit said the
company expects to sign a partnership contract with the foreign
bank within the next two months pending a final round of
negotiations.
	   The partnership is to offer mortgages and leasing loans to
Amway's customers and sales representatives. Sales agents will
receive commissions and other incentives related to other Amway
products.
	   Amway's strength is its vast marketing and distribution network
with more than 140,000 active sales representatives, according to
Preecha, while the partnership bank will be responsible for
providing consumer loans and other financial services.
	   In the first stage, the company plans to launch a payment
service using credit cards for its sales people by the end of this
year in partnership with the bank. The payment system aims at
providing convenience to Amway's sales representatives when paying
for the goods sold. Cards will also be offered to buyers of Amway
products and used in sales promotion campaigns.
	   Campaigns similar to the Smart Loyalty programme currently
involving major retailers and service stations, including the
Central/Robinson and Shell groups, and banks are being considered
by Amway whose products range from personal care and food to
household items and apparel.
	   Besides housing loans, items that can be purchased against
leasing and instalment payments include cars, furniture, decorative
items for the home, and jewellery, Preecha said.
	   Amway has been providing mortgage and leasing services for homes
and other items in the US and Australia. In Japan, Taiwan and Hong
Kong, the firm has started with a credit card payment system.
	   In the US, leasing and instalment services are provided to
customers through Amway's direct-selling network. This way, it
allows independent manufacturers, including carmakers, to expand
their distribution channel using Amway's network as well as
financial services.
	   In Thailand, Preecha said the company plans to launch a
'plus-point' card promotion campaign to its sales representatives,
who will collect points when selling Amway products in exchange
with incentives and rewards. He added the company aims to provide
credit cards to more than 1,000 sales representatives this year.
	   Because of higher import costs, Amway (Thailand) Ltd plans to
increase the ratio of locally-sourced products from 15 per cent to
more than 30 per cent over the next five years. The company plans
to provide direct-selling distribution and financial services to
independent manufacturers seeking to distribute their products
locally, said Preecha.
	   The economic crisis and lower spending power of consumers has
hit the direct-selling business. Preecha, who is secretary-general
of Thailand Direct Selling Association, said zero growth is
projected for the whole industry this year compared with 1997's
Bt20 billion in total sales.
	   Amway's 1997 sales were Bt4.8 billion.
	   Since the July 2 baht devaluation, spending through
direct-selling have dropped by 50 per cent.

<TEXT>
	   ADDRESSING someone as ``old fruit'' is actually rather old hat
or out-of-date these days, and it might conjure up a picture of an
over-ripe banana or a dodgy durian.
	   It was once an upper-class familiar greeting or slang form of
address for a friend, though why I am not at all sure. However, I
am interested in old fruit in a different sense this week, as
frequently, I am about to pluck the fruits of knowledge from
assorted reference books as well as the fruits of my own
experiences when teaching, talking and travelling.
	   So, since I come from the United Kingdom, let's start in London,
and let's start with a few small steps, otherwise known as ``the
apples and pears''.
	   What does an orchard have to do with steps, large or small, or
indeed with the city of London, you may ask? Well, naturally, steps
would be a help if you are harvesting the fruit, since a
step-ladder is necessary for tall trees, unless you are harvesting
coconuts and you have a handy beruk.
	   London is a bit more of a problem, and you may think that I am a
trifled confused, or even as nutty as a fruit cake (a wonderful
slang phrase for ``crazy''), since it is New York which is
colloquially known as ``the Big Apple''. London, I regret to say,
was known in earlier times as ``the Great Wen'', nothing to do with
fruit unless it's an allergic reaction, as a ``wen'' is a wart or
swelling on the skin.
	   Yes, as usual, I am monkeying about with English. In fact,
``apples-and- pears'' is another example of a slang phrase, but
it's a special kind, known as Cockney rhyming slang.
``Apples-and-pears'' rhymes with ``stairs''
	   and that's exactly what the apples-and-pears are; if you want to
know what Cockneys are, they are folk born in a certain area of
London, traditionally within earshot of the sound of the bells of
Bow church, so that's the London connection.
	   What on earth is a ``cockney'' when it's at home? Originally, it
was a ``cocken-ey'' or a cockerel's egg, a name given to any
strangely shaped or tiny hen's egg. Then it came to be used for a
spoilt child, and finally it came to describe someone who lived in
a big town, perhaps because city people were considered to be
spoilt compared with those from the country.
	   Indeed, to get back to the subject of fruit, it would seem that
at one point in history a cockney would also be ``the apple of
one's eye'', since a spoilt child is usually the darling of parents
or grandparents, and the apple of your eye is a description for the
thing you adore most.
	   Apples could perhaps be called the archetypal British fruit,
especially where I come from, since Worcester and Hereford (until
recently a couple of English counties united by what's colloquially
known as a ``shot-gun wedding'' since not everyone wanted to unite,
and now once again are two separate areas) are noted for their
orchards.
	   As a result, there are plenty of phrases about apples in the
English language, and when new fruits and veggies were introduced,
people tended to look at them as some strange kind of apple.
	   Take tomatoes, for instance, and I will take as many as
possible, since I am addicted to them in all shapes and forms and
am liable to consume tomatoes for breakfast, dinner and supper. The
word tomato is of Mexican origin, probably coming into Europe
through Spanish, but one of the first names for these delicious red
fruits was the ``love apple''.
	   I was somewhat taken aback to find, when I listened to a
cassette of a book on 19th-century English village life, that in
the 1890s none of the village children had tasted a tomato - to me
they are a fact of life in both the UK and Malaysia.
	   Going much further back in time, the potato (also through
Spanish and originally batata, from the South American language
Taino) was labelled the ``earth apple'' when it first appeared in
England in the 16th century.
	   To move to a more Malaysian scene, the pineapple is yet another
example, though in this case, the cones of pine-trees were the
original pineapples, and it was the tapering shape and the hard
knobs of outer skin that gave the tropical fruit a resemblance to
the cone. More dangerously, a ``pineapple'' is a nickname for a
hand-grenade, once again because of the resemblance in shape.
	   Apple puree or apple snow is a traditional English recipe for
cooked apples, but please don't make too much of a puree of the
spelling, or you will end up with ``appals'', and of course bad
spelling appals many people.
	   The verb ``to appal'' has little to do with fruit, and
everything to do with going pale, often because you are disgusted
or terrified. Making a hash of the pronunciation is not quite such
a disaster; students have often asked me if they should pronounce
it ``ah-pl'' or ``ep-pl'', but there's really no problem with
either of these. In standard British English the ``a'' tends to
come out as ``ah'', whereas in traditional Received Pronunciation
(as spoken by the Queen of England) it is closer to ``ep'', and in
standard American English it is more likely to be a longer version
of ``ep''.
	   Now let's go bananas. Unfortunately, I haven't yet discovered
when they invaded Europe, but I am glad they did, as when I was a
child it turned out to be one of the only things I felt like eating
after childhood illnesses.
	   Bananas are, of course, natives of Southeast Asia and will only
grow in tropical climates; interestingly, the name comes from a
place in Guinea in Africa, and has come into English through either
Spanish or Portuguese. An irrelevant but fascinating pair of facts
which I can't resist: while potatoes are about 75 per cent
carbohydrates, bananas are roughly 75 per cent water.
	   Pair, did I say? No, no, I meant pear, not to be confused with
``pare''.
	   As you can see, when it comes to pears, there is a trio of
homophones to be picked and sorted. A pair is two of a kind, and
must be regarded as singular rather than plural, as in ``there was
a pair of scissors on the table'' as opposed to ``the scissors were
on the table''. One scissor cuts no ice, to coin a phrase, since
you need both halves of the metal to come together before you can
cut, clip, chop, or snip.
	   As for ``pare'', well, it does have some associations with
fruit. It means ``to trim small pieces'' or ``to shave'' and you
can use it for vegetables as well as fruit when you carefully cut
off the outside skin or cut it into slices.
	   However, if we are talking about desserts (not just ones, but
sweet ones), then there is some distinction between the fruit and
the cheese when it comes to paring.
	   If you pare an apple, then there is no strong significance,
though you could try peeling the skin off in one long curl and then
throwing it over your shoulder - the letter formed by the skin is
traditionally supposed to be the first letter of your future
spouse's name. If you are cheese- paring, though, then the only
word for you is stingy. I suppose it means that you cut the cheese
as close to the rind as possible in order to get the most out of
your piece of Cheddar. A fruitless exercise, I should add, if you
are eating soft cheese, since it has no rind - hard cheese, in
fact.

	   PRO-democracy legislators plan another attempt at having racial
discrimination legislation included in equal opportunity laws.
	   An effort to outlaw discrimination based on race, age and sexual
orientation was defeated in the final days of the pre-handover
Legislative Council.
	   Citizens Party legislator-elect Christine Loh said she hoped to
introduce a bill before the end of the year.
	   ``Once we know who is the president of the new council, we will
be explaining the issue and attempting to have it raised,'' she
said.
	   Under the Basic Law, private members' bills need the approval of
the Chief Executive to be introduced.
	   Ms Loh said the passage of such a bill was also more difficult
because the majority support of both functional and geographical
constituency legislators was required.
	   Deputy Secretary for Home Affairs Peter Lo Yat-fai said
education and persuasion were more influential in changing opinions
than laws.
	   He said the government would review equal opportunity laws as
part of its regular monitoring of all legislation.
	   ``We think the educational approach is the best way to tackle
the issue. We will also conduct appropriate reviews of the
legislation but at this point in time we can't accept that new
legislation is necessary.'' But Ms Loh said racial discrimination
was a widespread problem faced not only by ethnic minorities, but
Chinese people as well, particularly mainlanders.
	   ``They need to open their eyes and ears. This is not a big
public issue so the government thinks it's alright. But the
problems are everywhere.'' Ms Loh said employment and the provision
of services were two of the most serious areas where racial
discrimination occurred.

	   THE government will hold a urgent meeting Wednesday to solve the
problem of illiquidity in the sugar and sugarcane industry, Deputy
Prime Minister Suwit Khunkitti said.
	   Suwit said he will chair the meeting with the concerned agencies
in an effort to solve the problem within this month.
	   Representatives from the Federation of Sugarcane Planters
Tuesday filed a petition with Suwit, urging the government to
tackle illiquidity and other problems affecting the industry, such
as low prices of cane and sugar and theburden of value-added tax.
	   Despite a lack of liquidity in the commercial banking system,
Suwit said he will try to secure financial support for cane growers
before the next harvest. A fall in production would have an adverse
impact on exports, he added.
	   Sugar is one of Thailand's top ten export earners.
	   Telling cane planters that the price for the 1997-98 season
could fall below Bt785 a tonne, Suwit said the government would
find ways to help sugar factories reduce operating costs.
	   Under the 70:30 benefit-sharing scheme, implemented almost 20
years ago, the sugar and cane sectors share their losses and gains.
	   The Finance Ministry will be consulted on the VAT issue, Suwit
said.
	   Cane planters earlier called off a rally to push for an increase
in the domestic sugar price after the Ministry of Commerce promised
that the final price for cane would be more than Bt785 a tonne.
However, the drop in international sugar prices since March to
US$220 a tonne from $268 a tonne threaten the target price for the
Thai market.
	   Furthermore, the drought-hit industry has seen a plunge in cane
production by one-fourth to 42 million tonnes from an earlier
projection.
	   Officials from the Industry Ministry earlier told The Nation
that the industry is expected to ask for Bt10 billion as additional
liquidity.
	   ''Unless the problem can be solved in time, cane output for the
1998 season are likely to fall by 50 per cent from an earlier
target of 40 million tonnes'', the official said.
	   Among the financial institutions mentioned by the official as
potential lenders to the industry are Rabo Bank, ABN Amro, Bank of
Thailand, and the Government Saving Bank.
	   Earlier, Reuters quoted shipping sources as saying that
Thailand's sugar exports during the first quarter of 1998 dropped
by 46 per cent to 891,846 tonnes compared with 1.67 million tonnes
during the same period last year.
	   The biggest buyer in the first quarter was Indonesia which
bought 538,850 tonnes of white and refined sugar from Thailand.

	   TROUBLED Selangor left for Kota Kinabalu yesterday for their
away match against Sabah tonight, and it could be the last match
for some of the senior players.
	   Moreover, another defeat to Sabah could also spell the end for
the current team management.
	   Knowing the political intrigue in the FA of Selangor (FAS),
something drastic may emerge later this week.
	   With fans snubbing their once-favourite team, Selangor today
hardly look like a side who bagged three titles, including the
Malaysia Cup, last season.
	   Many questions have been raised following Selangor's failure to
win any of their previous five matches, a run which has seen them
plunged to third from the bottom of the table.
	   Hopefully, these questions will be answered when they return
from Kota Kinabalu, as promised by Selangor team manager Datuk
Mokhtar Ahmad.
	   After a meeting with coaches Ismail Zakaria and Mohamed Shah
Norbit, the team management have agreed to stick with the current
batch of players for the time being. ``We may have been losing but
the players were very committed. I believe we will do well again,''
said Ismail with optimism, despite a humiliating 1-0 defeat to
Sabah last Saturday, their first at home this season.
	   For now, Mokhtar said he will not be making any drastic changes
to the squad or in the management team.
	   ``We will come to a concrete decision when we return from Kota
Kinabalu.
	   It is simple - with the squad we have on our hands, we cannot
fail,'' said Mokhtar.
	   However, the man in the centre of the storm is not even in the
country.
	   Datuk Aini Taib, the man who brought three consecutive Malaysia
Cup titles to Selangor from 1995 to 1997 and the leader whom the
fans believe can reverse the fortunes of the team this season, is
currently in Yangon, Myanmar, as manager of the national Under-16
team.
	   He will return on Thursday and there will definitely be a
high-powered meeting between top FAS officials then.
	   Last Saturday, fans openly chanted for Mokhtar to be replaced by
Aini.
	   One FAS official pointed out that what the fans did at Shah Alam
stadium must have been well-rehearsed.
	   ``The banners and the fans' behaviour were something that cannot
be done spontaneously. It was so well planned and aimed to make the
current team management look bad,'' said the official.
	   FAS vice president Zaini Idris, another man whom the fans are
not happy with, said: ``It was amazing to hear almost every fan in
the stadium chanting against the current team management. It was as
if someone was behind it,'' said Zaini.

Reform vital in legal sector, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): The legal sector is trailing behind other sectors.
Historically, from colonial times, the law in political life has
always been employed as an instrument of devide et impera (divide
and rule) and repression, while in the economic realm, the law
often plays its role as an instrument benefiting businesspeople and
capitalists.
	   So the law obviously has not optimally contributed to democracy
and social justice, especially considering that court jurisprudence
is not always properly treated as a legal source. At this juncture,
the law is not only void of neutrality, but it even takes sides
with the ruling elite and businesspeople.
	   The role of the law has not changed much since our independence
in 1945, particularly because the existing legal instruments are
the legacy of colonial laws. It is worthy of note, however, that
many legal products in the era of independence, including those
produced during the Soeharto administration, continue the colonial
legal policies translated into idolization of stability, security
and order, and economic growth.
	   The oft-intimated policy of even distribution of income has
turned out to be more of a political statement (wishful thinking).
It is very difficult for a legal policy like this to be on the side
of democracy and social justice.
	   The resulting legal products, consequently, have shackled our
civil and political rights, as we have all experienced with the
enforcement of the law during general elections, the law on
political parties and the functional group, the law on the
structure of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the House of
People's Representatives (DPR) and the regional legislative
assembly (DPRD), the law on mass organizations, the law on
referendum and the law on principles of the press.
	   In the economic sector, our legal products, some of which do
take into account the interests of the common people, generally
side with businesspeople and capitalist, such as the law on foreign
investment, the law on domestic investment and the law on the
capital market.
	   Please note that deregulatory packages have also turned into
legal products which, despite their legal validity, raise doubt in
that they are enforceable as instruments benefiting businesspeople
and capitalists.
	   In this context, our compliance with the legal products of the
World Trade Organization has made it difficult to protect the
interests of small and medium-scale businesspeople and consumers.
Unfortunately, the internationalization of the laws in the economic
realm, which apply the principles of nondiscrimination and national
treatment, will eventually make this country a mere pocket of the
latest form of economic colonization.
	   The judiciary is the most important part in the legal sector. It
is no longer a public secret that our judicial institutions and
judges are known to be not only restricted in their freedom and
self-reliance, but are also infected by corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   Unless reform is carried out in the judicial institutions and in
the corps of judges of all levels, legal reform will become stuck.
In this context, legal products such as the law on the principle of
judicial power, the law on general judiciary and the law on the
Supreme Court need immediate revision and/or replacement.
	   The main challenge is to make a judicial institution one that
translates the law in all fairness and impartiality in our social
life. Especially in respect to the Supreme Court, the expansion of
the right to exercise judicial review of a law is absolutely
necessary if we wish to see legal control over legal products of
the government and the DPR, which may well violate the
constitutional principles such as democracy, human rights and
social justice.
	   It is no exaggeration to conclude, then, that the right to
judiciary review indicates acknowledgement of the supremacy of the
law in a law-based state. Therefore, naming legislative review as
the most appropriate instrument for Indonesia in this context is
tantamount to subordinating the supremacy of the law to dominant
political interests.
	   The demand for legal reform is a historical necessity.
	   The most urgent legal reform agenda in restoring civil and
political rights is the revocation of repressive legal products
(the Subversion Law, hatzaai artikelen, and so forth), the revision
of nonfacilitating legal products (the law on general elections,
the law on political parties and the functional group, the law on
the structure and the position of the MPR, the DPR and the DPRD,
the law on mass organizations, the law on principles of the press).
	   Also, the issuance of reform-supporting new legal products (a
law on public information and others) are equally urgent.
	   In the economic realm, it is of great urgency to issue legal
products which may better protect small and medium-scale
businesspeople and consumers, such as the antimonopoly law, the law
on consumer protection, and so forth).
	   The above mentioned total legal reform would eventually lead us
to political and economic reforms. The goals of our nationhood and
statehood, underlined with a longing for democracy and social
justice, can be reached when legal reform measures are taken in a
planned, speedy and sustainable manner.
	   The writer is a member of the Working Group of the Forum for
Democracy.
	   Window: The role of the law has not changed much since our
independence in 1945, particularly because the existing legal
instruments are the legacy of colonial laws.

	   MORE and more people are dying or suffering from fatal diseases
such as brain tumours, mammarian or breast cancer and brain
haemorrhage due to a lack of proper medical care.However, things
may change as the Srisiam Hospital in Bangkok has now established
the first ever Radio Surgery Institute in Thailand -- (there are
presently more than 100 radio surgery centres around the world).
	   Radio surgery is a modern technique which doesn't require
surgery in order to remove cancerous growth or tissues. It involves
a three dimensional method known as Stereotaxic Surgery, which is
also used in conjunction with radiation equipment known as the
Linear Accelerator.
	   With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous
tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs
that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio
surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are
conscious while they undergo treatment.
	   This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as
Artero Venous Malformation (the clotting of veins or blood
capillaries in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio
surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to
remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need
for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar,
little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact
the hospital at srisiam  ksc.th.com.

	   TOKYO (JP): Choreography and orchestration ofU.S. President Bill
Clinton's upcoming trip to China and Hong Kong this month has
exceeded the hopes of the Propaganda Department of the Chinese
Communist Party.
	   Indeed, their success reminds me of the slogan printed on the
little slip of paper inside a fortune cookie I was served at a San
Francisco Chinatown restaurant last summer: ``There can be no harm
in asking.''
	   The Chinese have asked for -- and received approval for -- these
points on the President Clinton June itinerary:
	   Overfly No. 1 Asian-ally Japan to and from Beijing, citing that
President Jiang Zemin made no extra stops during his visit last
year; it would be a loss of face to Jiang if Clinton visited Japan
enroute or on the way back (The White House has reacted to mounting
criticism of this snub by inviting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to Washington in July).
	   Visit Tiananmen Square, to indicate U.S. acceptance that the
book is closed on the June 4, 1989 bloodbath crackdown on
pro-democracy students which I witnessed there. No amount of
propaganda or whitewash enacted by any president will dilute that
from my memory;
	   Visit Hong Kong around the July 1 first-year anniversary of the
handover from Britain to China where Clinton will give his seal of
approval that Hong Kong is free (even the Wall Street Journal and
Heritage Foundation claim so in their annual Report on Economic
Freedom), that the peg of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar
and unchanged rate of the Chinese renminbi currency are providing
stability and that generally (''Are you listening, Taiwan?'')the
``one country, two systems ``formula is highly workable.
	   Behind the scenes, however, Hong Kong is having some problems
with its own economy and there is subtle erosion of its free press.
	   A blip in the Hong Kong visit is that U.S. officials have told
Martin Lee, leader of opposition forces in Hong Kong that won 60
percent of the popular vote in an election last week, that Clinton
has no plansto meet with him privately during his stopover.
	   State Department officials suggested insteadthat Clinton meet
with Lee along with leaders of other political parties in Hong
Kong, including several pro-Beijing parties, which won some seats
in the voting.
	   Lee's office opposes the plan because it implies that Lee is on
equal footing with the pro-Beijing groups, some of which did not
participate in the directly-elected segment of the ballot.
	   A State Department officials told Lee on May 15, according to
the Washington Post's John Pomfret quoting sources close to Lee
(that's journalese for Lee himself), that Clinton would not meet
with him alone or with otherdemocratic activists because he is
worried about offending China.
	   Talk about self-censorship. What is the U.S. promoting,
democracy or communism?
	   Clinton met alone with Lee in April 1997 for half an hour at the
White House.
	   ``It is very different to see someone in the U.S. as opposed to
in their own country,'' the aide to Lee quoted a State Department
official as saying.
	   The source added that on May 11, U.S. Consul General in Hong
Kong Richard Boucher proposed that Clinton meet Lee in a group.
	   But Lee received 143,843 votes and he pointed out that Hong
Kong's appointed leader Tung Chee-hwa has never stood for a genuine
election.
	   I can understand why Clinton might shy away from an individual
meeting with Lee, on public relations grounds. The feisty activist
takes no prisoners inone-on-one meetings and would be likely to
giveClinton an earful. I was scolded by Lee once for being 20
minutes late--actually I was 10 minutesearly--for a meeting whose
start time was botched by respective secretaries. Lee said he was a
``busy man'' and I believe it.
	   Criticism of arrangements of Clinton's visit come againsta
backdrop of allegations that the U.S. supplied sensitive missile
technology and that political funds were funneled through the
daughter of a high ranking Chinese military official. Some members
of Congress have demanded that the trip be canceled.
	   The president has mixed those demands and on May 27 it was
reported that Clinton had used a newly established hotline to
inform President Jiang that he was coming to Chinadespite the
congressional criticism. It was the first use of the hotline on the
U.S. side.
	   Washington has signaled that there will be ``no change'' in its
Taiwan policybut Clinton is likely to give some verbal stroking to
China on the issue although nothing new in writing, despite
Beijing's hopes.
	   The only other thingthe State Department didn't go along
with---to that establishment'severlasting credit---was the devious
Chinese request that Clinton visitthe city of Nanking, scene
of''The Rape of Nanking'' by Japanese troops in December of 1937. A
book by that title written by Iris Chang has been the center of
controversy and on the bestseller lists in the U.S in recent weeks.
	   Beijing pointed out that President Jiang stopped at Pearl Harbor
(at China's request) en route to the U.S. lastyear to underscore
who the U.S. enemy in Asiareally is. A Nanking visit would have
played in the U.S. as China being the true friend of the U.S
against Japan. The State Department was not amused and declined.
	   China was hoping to gain some hardball advantage going into the
September visit of President Jiang to Tokyo.
	   On May 28 the American Embassy in Japan issued a statement
clarifying words attributed to Ambassador Thomas Foley by Jiji
Press. The Japanese press had headlined.''U.S. to Switch to
Alliance with China.''
	   What Foley had said was ``but as much as our individual
relations are improving with China, no one should have any doubt
that the 21st century, as (well as) the latter part of this
century, will be marked by a strong, fundamental U.S.-Japan
partnership and alliance in the Asia-Pacific region.
	   It has maintained peace and security and encouraged prosperity
for 45 years and I believe that it will continue to expand in the
21st century, and remain a great bulwark for prosperity and
security in the next century.''
	   After weeks of treatment from the U.S. bordering on rudeness
from Clinton on down, the words were a welcome reassurance to Tokyo
government and business leaders as well as to the salaryman
hoisting a beer in a Ginza pub after work.
	   The writer is a veteran analyst of Northeast Asian affairs and a
Media Fellow at Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
	   Window: Behind the scenes, however, Hong Kong is having some
problems with its own economy and there is subtle erosion of its
free press.

	   HOW long is it since you paid a visit to an elderly relative?
Days, weeks, months? Showing that you care, means a lot, according
a recent survey conducted by the Public Health Ministry.The
ministry's findings demonstrate that adults who take time out of
spend with their parents or other close families members can make a
significant contribution to longevity.
	   The number of elderly people in Thai society is steadily
increasing, going from 7.2 per cent in 1990 to 8.4 per cent last
year. Demographers predict that the figure will be as high as 9.2
per cent in the year 2000. At present, there are approximately five
million elderly people in Thailand, many of whom are unable to take
care of themselves.
	   The ministry hopes that these finding will encourage us all to
concentrating on boosting the quality of life of older people by
giving them more of our time and providing care as needed. For more
information on what you can do to help, call 591 8612.

	   While Pakistan's nuclear testing did not come as a surprise to
most, some expected it to display statesmanship by exercising
restraint. Pakistan has proved its sympathisers wrong by trying to
be one step ahead of India in the nuclear issue.
	   The media in Thailand have been ignorant, or pretend to be
ignorant, to the fact that both India and Pakistan are nuclear
states. Political observers of the sub-continent know that the two
countries acquired the nuclear capability long before this
controversy. While India was belligerent enough to test it in 1974,
Pakistan was always engaged in the same exercise in secrecy with
Chinese help. India's testing of the device now, for reasons
justified or not, does not absolve Pakistan of its guilt of
clandestine pursuits of the same goal. It was a question of who was
willing to declare it first.
	   One leading Bangkok newspaper says: ''Pakistan should have taken
the moral high road and shown it was superior to India in ideals''.
Pakistan has used its resources, moral or otherwise, in running
terrorist camps that train and help terrorists infiltrate India.
India has provided in international forum credible evidence proving
the existence of such camps. Only weeks ago Pakistan's information
minister visited one such camp and was criticised even in the
Pakistani press. So much for Pakistan's ideals.
	   If Pakistan's intentions were just to match India's testing, as
a deterrent only, they would have stopped with the five (?)
equivalent tests especially after India announced a moratorium for
further testing. They have also confirmed that they would fit their
long-range missile Ghauri with nuclear warheads. If the media think
that India needs to be condemned for flexing its muscle first, so
be it. But it is certainly ignorant, if not biased, to suggest that
Pakistan had pursued high moral standards and superior ideals while
dealing with India till now.

	   VOLATILE interest rates have prompted banks to adopt a
wait-and-see attitude towards the newly launched Hong Kong dollar
repurchase (repo) facility, bankers said yesterday.
	   The new facility has drawn numerous inquiries from banks
following its launch last Friday as a tool to ease tight liquidity
in the financial market.
	   Bankers said that no transaction has been completed yet despite
the initial strong response that the facility has drawn from scores
of banks.
	   The cool response of banks is a good indication that the problem
of tight liquidity would continue for a while despite calls by
developers and other corporates for government to tackle this
issue, they said.
	   Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) acting chief executive David
Carse, however, said that it might take about two to three months
before the impact of the new facility would be felt.
	   ``These things obviously take time to build up. But over the
next two to three months, we'll see its effect in terms of easing
tight liquidity in the market,'' Mr Carse said.
	   Bankers attributed the wait-and-see attitude of banks partly to
the sharp rise in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (Hibor)
yesterday.
	   Interest rates of the Hong Kong dollar repurchase facility are
pegged to Hibor.
	   The benchmark three-month Hibor shot up yesterday to 9.01339 per
cent compared to its previous level of 8.05804 per cent on Monday.
	   Bankers attributed yesterday's sharp rise in Hibor to concerns
over the deterioration of the local economy and fears that weakness
in the Japanese yen will lead to another round of competitive
currency depreciations in the region.
	   Six banks were making quotations for Hong Kong-dollar paper _
HongkongBank, Standard Chartered, Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank,
Dao Heng Bank and Bank of East Asia.
	   HSBC Markets _ the treasury arm of HongkongBank _ was quoting
8-8.2 per cent for 3-month Hong Kong-dollar debt papers and 8-8.3
per cent for six-month Hong Kong-dollar debt paper for amounts of
$100 million, said Jack Cheung of HSBC Markets.
	   Dao Heng Bank was offering quotes of 20 basis points above
three-month Hibor and 30 basis points above six-month Hibor, said
Tam Ping-shing, general manager for treasury of Dao Heng Bank.
	   Mr Tam declined to disclose the volume which Dao Heng Bank was
quoting on the Hong Kong-dollar debt papers.
	   Fuji International Finance Hong Kong assistant director Adolf
Cheung yesterday said it would take about three months before the
effects of the new repurchase facility would be felt.

	   By March 1, the doors of banks in 17 of the 48 states had been
closed because the banks could not pay their depositors. The
government did not have enough money to meet its March 15 payroll
obligations. The largest private savings bank in the world in the
nation's largest city was in danger of failing. The government
estimated that 15 million men, most of them heads of households,
were unemployed, and that one-fourth of the population had no
income whatever, and instead survived by borrowing, begging, or in
some cases stealing. The economic, banking and social crises
threatening the country were terrifying.
	   This was the Great Depression, and the United States seemed on
the brink of ruin. It was in this context of national despair that
Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as 32nd president of the United
States on March 4, 1933.
	   President Roosevelt's government had taken a number of resolute
acts but they did not end the Depression. Meanwhile, they broke its
stranglehold on America by restoring people's faith that the
government would act to cure the economic and social ills of the
preceding years.
	   Indonesia is not the United States; Indonesia's problems are
different from those that faced the United States during the
Depression, and the solution will be different. But there are
similarities worth remembering in the conditions faced by the two
countries 65 years apart. In 1933, the U.S. was on the verge of
financial collapse, as Indonesia now is; some of the causes of the
American Depression were also linked to corruption.
	   Like the U.S., Indonesia is a resource-rich country that holds
the seeds of its own resurgence. Though reform was needed,
Americans in 1932 elected as president a man known more for his
elitist, conservative background than for his reputation as a
reformer, just as Indonesians today have accepted President B.J.
Habibie, who has not been known as naturally reform-oriented.
	   Let President Habibie present his hundred-day agenda to the
House of Representatives as soon as possible but no later than the
end of June; let other presidential candidates do the same. If
there is to be a special session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), let it happen not in six months, but in June.
Indonesia has already lost seven months of recovery time and can
ill afford the luxury of a transition-caretaker president for six
months or a year longer while waiting for the perfect reform
president to emerge.
	   The threat of recurring change at the helm of the government
would not inspire international confidence in the country or its
currency. So let President Habibie and his challengers announce
promptly their reform proposals. Then let the MPR act promptly to
give the presidential and vice presidential mandates to that
candidate, either President Habibie or someone else, who presents
the most credible proposals for reform and recovery.
	   A nation's ills will not be cured in the first hundred days of a
presidential term, nor in the first thousand days, nor in a single
generation, as President John Kennedy cautioned. The cure may not
be instantaneous but the rescue needs to begin immediately.

	   PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai will suspend foreign trips for
three months so that he has time to meet local people, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said Tuesday.
	   Chuan has already cancelled a planned trip to Hong Kong where he
was to deliver a speech at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the
Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review magazine on June 10 and
11.
	   The prime minister has also cancelled a trip to Manila where he
was to participate in centenary celebrations marking the
independence of the Philippines scheduled for June 12 and 13.
	   Initially, the premier planned to travel from Hong Kong to
Manila, Kobsak said.
	   ''The premier has said that he will not travel overseas for
three months so that he can make time to meet people in the
provinces. The Chuan government has been criticised for not
focusing its attention on the poor, therefore the prime minister
will spend more time with them,'' Kobsak said.
	   Thailand is facing economic difficulties which are expected to
get worse in the coming months, so Chuan will be in town to take
care of matters, the spokesman said.
	   Surin to meet envoys FOREIGN Minister Surin Pitsuwan will
separately meet the ambassadors of India and Pakistan on Friday to
express Thailand's deep concern at the recent nuclear tests,
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Karun Ruchuyothin said Tuesday.
	   Karun said Surin will inform the ambassadors that the nuclear
tests have badly affected security in South Asia as well as the
security of the world community.
	   The Foreign Ministry said earlier that Surin is expected to urge
India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty as soon as possible.
	   Crisis hits fashion-conscious BANGKOK'S women office workers
have become less fashion-conscious as a result of the economic
crunch and some even said their wardrobes have been swollen with
recycled dresses, according to a study released Tuesday.
	   The study was conducted on 391 women across occupations and
professions.
	   Of those surveyed, 52.2 per cent said they preferred tailored
dresses while 45.6 per cent said they used ready-to-wear apparel
available at department stores. A mere 2.6 per cent said they felt
fine in hand-me-downs, the Thai Farmers Bank research centre survey
said.
	   Changed sartorial tastes included: 35.2 per cent said they have
stopped having new dresses tailored or buying new dresses, and 33
per cent said they have fewer new dresses tailored and buy fewer
new dresses.
	   An undisclosed percentage said they had their office clothing
refitted so it can be used again.
	   Tyres blamed for break downs AN average of one car overturns in
an accident every day on Bangkok's expressway, an official said
Tuesday.
	   Police warned motorists to make sure their tyres are in good
condition before driving on the expressway as a number of cars
break down on the expressway because of worn out tyres.
	   Somsak Sribunrueng, an expressway traffic controller, said that
of the 40 to 50 cars that break down every day, many have over- or
under-inflated tyres.
	   Many accidents occur because motorists' drive too fast and their
worn out tyres explode.
	   A man was seriously injured Tuesday after the tyre of his car
exploded causing the speeding vehicle to overturn on the expressway
at the Artnarong exit. The accident resulted in traffic grinding to
a halt for over an hour with a tail-back as far as Bang Na-Trad Km
5.

	   AS the time to save endangered species gets shorter and shorter,
a unique project at the Khao Khiew Open Zoo is offering a small ray
of hope. Manote Tripathi reports on the use of advanced technology
to save the Kingdom's precious fauna.
	   PLACING endangered species in a freezer may sound a little
brutal, but Sumate Kamolnorranath is perfectly happy seeing them
stiffen at a deadly minus 196 degrees centigrade.
	   There's nothing insane or cruel about this; quite the reverse
actually. For what Sumate is doing is using the latest technique in
keeping other species from going the same way as the dinosaurs.
	   In fact, Sumate is not into herding living animals into freezing
temperatures at all -- just their sperm. The intention?
Preservation. The purpose? Creation.
	   A semen bank, or ''genome resource bank''for endangered species
is gradually taking shape at the Khao Khiew Open Zoo in Chonburi,
which Sumate estimates is the biggest sperm storage centre in
Thailand. Eventually, semen from a variety of animal species will
be kept here in thousands of test tubes, which are being
temporarily stored in freezers at the Dusit Zoo while construction
of sperm bank facilities are underway.
	   The conservation of endangered animals in semen banks was
established worldwide in 1992, a fact better known abroad than at
home at the time. The semen bank in Chonburi currently receives
financial, technological and personnel assistance from the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.
	   It's ultimate goal is to ensure the continuation of near-extinct
species in Thailand, which include the krathing (gaur), wua daeng
(red cow), tiger, maew pah (jungle-cat), lamang (brown-antlered
deer), keng (barking deer), nok kra rian (flamingo), nok nguak
(hornbill), and mah nai (Cuon javanicus).
	   The flamingo, the brown-antlered deer, and the jungle cat can no
longer be seen in the jungles of Thailand -- although they can be
found in neighbouring countries like Laos -- and may only be seen
in zoos such as Khao Khiew.
	   Meanwhile, there are only 1000 gaurs, 500-600 tigers and 500 red
cows left in the wild.
	   ''In reality, every species in Thailand is in danger of
extinction right now,'' says Sumate, the chief curator at Khao
Khiew Open ZooSperm can be stored indefinately at a stable
temperature, and although a minority die in the freezing process,
there remain enough for either test tube breeding or in the womb of
a host animal.
	   However, the preservation of semen in test tubes needs proper
care and hydrogen liquid is supplied at regular intervals to
stabilise the temperature in the freezer.
	   As natural breeding is difficult with some species because the
mating season is too slow, artificial insemination is used and
placing the semen in the ovary is a delicate job.
	   The process involves the insertion of a long wire mounted with a
small digital camera [which transmits the proceedings onto a
computer screen] into the abdomen of the animal to ensure the
injection of semen is correctly positioned at the ovary.
	   ''Brown-antlered deer only produce one baby a year,'' says
Samate, ''so we use a technique to stimulate an ovary to produce as
many as 10 eggs at a time. Then, in the course of a year, we might
have 10 of these deer artificially inseminated,'' Sumate explains.
	   Wanchai Tunwattana, a staff member at the sperm bank, was
concerned whether the offspring of endangered species will be able
to survive after being returned to their natural habitat. ''We need
to do more research to discover whether the offspring are capable
of taking care of themselves, and also take into account the
threats from humans -- especially the hunters,'' says Wanchai.
	   He added that it was crucial to both select the right habitat
and educate villagers about the ecological importance of the
wildlife to prevent further hunting.
	   ''It's bad enough with the human threat,''added Sumate,
''because Thailand, unlike Africa, lacks proper measures in
managing the use of pasture and jungle. Sometimes, villages
encroach onto the fringes of jungles, and when animals appear,
villagers either scare them away or kill them -- despite the fact
that their farm lands have spread into the wildlife habitat.
	   ''Sometimes wildlife conservationists feel disheartened,'' he
continued, ''I overheard some people saying that if we want to stop
villagers from hunting, we should buy the villagers pork or other
food. That really hurt us,'' laments Sumate.
	   Sumate is also saddened by the fact that wildlife numbers are
dwindling so fast his sperm bank project can't keep up.
	   ''We have to speed up our conservation process. Although the
Forestry Department is responsible for the protection of the
jungles, there's just not enough being done. Yet wildlife numbers
continue to decrease. Presently, we have very few tigers left and
if they disappear, I can say that we would then have a real crisis
on our hands, because it would mean the deers would have gone too
-- as their food sources are the same,'' he says.
	   ''Yes, I'm pessimistic --because of the truth.'' Is cloning a
possibility?
	   ''I've been thinking about that. But with the current funding
and technology we have, cloning wildlife is years away. We simply
don't have the potential yet.'' However, the zoo has already
successfully cross-bred gaurs, tigers, and brown-antlered deer.
Breeding animals, notes Samate, is less complicated than breeding
birds -- which is costly and yields uncertain results.
	   As an example, Phetch, (a gaur) was taken from the jungle in
Ranong province when he was small and chosen for a breeding
programme, as gaurs are considered superior to domestic cows in
terms of immunity system, physical structure, and size.
	   Now five-years-old, Phetch stands at nearly two metres tall and
the zoo has attempted cross-breeding him with domestic cows to
boost immunity in the weaker ones who invariably sustain feet
infections during the rainy season.
	   ''We can only crossbreed Phetch with cows at the moment because
we still can't find Phetch a female gaur. To do so, we have to seek
permission from the Forestry Department. You know what it's like
with bureaucracy. All you can do is wait.'' But waiting involves
time: And time is something our endangered species simply don't
have.

<TEXT>
	   The government's decision to release Dr. Muchtar Pakpahan and
Dr. Sri Bintang Pamungkas from prison has made me both happy and
sad. I am happy because it suggests that Habibie's administration
is committed to total reform within the bounds of the constitution.
However, one gets the impression that this good-will gesture is
discriminatory.
	   Muchtar Pakpahan is known to have leftist leanings and received
great attention from the government before he was set free. In the
meantime, Moslem political convicts have not received any
attention, let alone been given priority for parole, despite many
having been imprisoned for large parts of their lives.
	   Community members, including those who claim to be pro-democracy
and pro-reform, have enthusiastically welcomed the release of
Pakpahan and Sri Bintang and treated them to the kind of reception
reserved for heroes. The mass media has also been swept up in the
euphoria.
	   Let me suggest to both Muchtar Pakpahan and Sri Bintang that you
don't get carried away with all this attention and begin to act
like late, and therefore uncalled for, heroes. To the best of my
knowledge, while in prison, these two ``figures'' (particularly Sri
Bintang) spent a lot of time crying because they couldn't bear
their cell conditions, which were worse than their own bathrooms.
	   As for the mass media, it has a responsibility to report news in
a balanced manner and not make a coconut tree out of a bean sprout.
	   I also wish to call on the government not to assume a
discriminatory stance. Moslem political convicts are subject to
much more flagrant human rights violations than Muchtar Pakpahan
and Sri Bintang ever were.
	   The torture and suffering inflicted on Moslem political convicts
has also been worse than that experienced by the kidnapped
political activists, including Pius, Desmond, Heryanto Taslam, Nuku
Sulaiman. Furthermore, for a large stretch of their captivity the
National Commission on Human Rights did not exist. Even after the
commission was established, inadequate attention was given to
Moslem political convicts.
	   The ever-so-respectable members of the National Commission on
Human Rights are in fact a bunch of cowards. They do not defend
human rights in earnest. They know that the ``movements'' which
Moslem political convicts were imprisoned for their links to were
invented by the state security apparatus, particularly during the
times when Ali Moertopo, Sudomo, Benny Moerdani and Try Sutrisno
were in office.
	   The government should unconditionally release these Moslem
political convicts and cease to force those already granted parole
to report regularly to the authorities as is the current practice.
Unless this is done, the deep feeling of injustice will persist,
and this, obviously, will incur the wrath of Moslems.
	   As a former political convict, I believe that now is the right
time to square accounts with the underlings of the New Order regime
because they have done many cruel things to Moslems in the course
of their dirty political practices.
	   However, the door of repentance is still open to you. But we
need proof.

Ukrainian customs officials arrested on drugs charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two Ukrainian customs officials were
arrested for stealing and trying to sell 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds)
of hashish confiscated near the border, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The two stole the hashish Jan. 19 from a shipment detained in
the Uzhhorod region near Ukraine's border with Slovakia and
Hungary, the regional Interior Ministry department said, according
to Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   The drugs, destined for the Czech capital, Prague, were
concealed in a Czech truck under parquet wood for floors, the
ministry said. The hashish was marked as glue for the parquetry, it
said.
	   The two customs officials and an accomplice planned to sell the
hashish for dlrs 25,000, the newspaper said.
	   The ministry said a large amount of foreign currency and three
cars were confiscated from the three, whose names were not
released.
	   Western Ukraine has become a drug transit route. In January,
police in Uzhhorod arrested a gang of smugglers who transported
heroin from Central Asia to Western Europe, Kievskiye Vedomosti
said.

	   SHELL Malaysia has introduced another value-added service with
the launch of an indent card system for government vehicles.
	   Called ``SuperKad'', this ``swipe, fill and go'' system will
replace the previous indent system for government agencies to pay
for fuel at Shell petrol stations nationwide.
	   The previous indent system is voluminous in paper generation,
laborious in processing, time-consuming in execution and subject to
human error and abuse, said Shell managing director of oil products
sector Saw Choo Boon.
	   Hence, the computerised ``SuperKad'' ensures more efficient
control of fuel supply and purchases.
	   The system has been used by Shell's commercial customers for
some time.
	   The ``Superkad'' was launched by Treasury secretary-general
Datuk Dr Aris Othman at Shell's Megah Indah Enterprise Sdn Bhd's
station in Bandar Utama, Selangor, yesterday.
	   Initially, the ``SuperKad'' system or the Government Fleet Card
will be used by various departments under the Ministry of Finance.
	   The system will be extended to other ministries and agencies
after six months. Besides Shell, Petronas also offers a similar
service.
	   The Government Fleet Card service by Petronas is known as
``SmartPay''.
	   The introduction of SuperKad and SmartPay was the result of a
study by the Government on the use of credit card for the supply of
fuel to its agencies' fleet of vehicles in 1995.
	   As a result of the study, Shell and Petronas were appointed as
the official petrol stations for fuel supply.
	   Transactions with Shell were handled by Southern Bank Bhd while
Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd handled those with Petronas.
	   The Government, however, terminated the service on May 31 last
year due to ``banking hitches'' and other technical matters, and
replaced it with the paper-based indent system.
	   However, the paper-based system caused problems as the
Government had to handle about 200,000 vouchers per month and used
some 11 million documents.

Danish artist to bring Chinese dissidents to Denmark next year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Danish artist who created a controversial
sculpture honoring those slain in the 1989 bloody military
crackdown in Beijing said Wednesday he will invite Chinese
dissidents to Denmark for a conference next year to commemorate the
massacre.
	   The conference will coincide with the 10th anniversary of the
bloody crackdown on June 4, 1989, when Chinese soldiers killed
hundreds if not thousands of demonstrators around Tiananmen Square,
said Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot in a statement.
	   ``We will provide an opportunity for the Chinese democracy
movement to meet for the first time since the massacre,'' the
statement said.
	   Galschiot's group, Art in Defence of Humanism, is hosting the
conference.
	   China has continued to persecute dissidents after the massacre,
and many have fled to the West. Most are staying in the United
States and France.
	   Galshiot's sculpture, Pillar of Shame, has been standing in a
public park in Hong Kong since Sunday as local activists prepare to
commemorate the ninth anniversary of the event.
	   On Tuesday, Hong Kong city officials refused to give activists
space in any public parks or museums to display the sculpture
permanently, saying it was too controversial.
	   The sculpture depicts 50 badly twisted faces symbolizing the
pain of the people, and carries a plaque reading: ``How can old
people kill the youth?''
	   It was shipped to Hong Kong last May for the annual candlelight
vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen massacre.
	   The sculpture has been on a tour of the territory's university
campuses since last June. Activists say they may have to put the
sculpture in a container after Thursday night's vigil until they
can find it a permanent home.
	   Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic
Democratic Movements in China, the vigil's organizer, said in a
statement that it will broadcast a videotape of speeches by two
prominent Chinese dissidents, Wang Dan and Wei Jinsheng. Wang, a
leader of Beijing's 1989 student movement, will also speak at the
vigil live by phone, the statement said.
	   Both dissidents are on medical parole in the United States.
	   ``Hong Kong people should try keep a cool head and protect their
own little base for democracy and make it the root of democracy for
the entire China,'' the statement quoted Wei as saying on the
videotape.
	   Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule last year, and leaders
have warned repeatedly that Hong Kong will not become a base for
anti-China activities. But anti-government protests have remained
legal in Hong Kong after the handover.

	   One night I could not sleep, although physically, I was dead
tired from reading, or better said scrutinizing, five or six
newspapers every day and listening attentively to all kinds of news
broadcasts by state and private television stations. Not to mention
listening to controversial gossip circulating without a clear
source.
	   Despite an educational background and experience in a number of
important posts, both military and civilian, I am confused about
conflicting legal interpretations and news about people asking for
more freedom of mind and actions, which actually is very logical
after the ironhanded leadership of the second president.
	   Will more freedom at this time benefit the country or will it
bring more confusion if we cannot restrict ourselves to the most
necessary items, according to the time and situation? The students
have made history by opening the door for reform, unfortunately not
without sacrifices.
	   As a contribution, I would like to give some suggestions:
	   1. Actions should be directed to the heart of the people, who
are now filled with fear, doubt and uncertainty of what is going to
happen. If the people have peace and confidence in the government,
then steps taken will be viewed not with suspicion but with a will
to help realize all the government's plans.
	   2. Let the people have enough to eat and give them the
capability to provide themselves with daily needs. A man with a
full stomach is a contented man, and the stomach cannot wait. To
this end, the government should make basic commodities easily
available and at affordable prices.
	   3. Let the intellectuals, politicians and community leaders be
endowed with a nationalist spirit. These educated and experienced
people should work hard to lay a foundation for a better state,
where everybody can have a peaceful and happy life based on a legal
system which will give equal chance, opportunity and protection to
all. The era of nepotism should be killed once and for all, which,
I must confess, is easier said than done.
	   We must decide what should be done first for the benefit of the
whole nation and what should be the agenda.
	   In my opinion, the reopening of the Marsinah, Udin and Tanjung
Priok cases is important, and I fully agree to and support this
effort. But the timing should be right, when the urgent and basic
problems of food supply and elections of a president and vice
president and other national problems are solved to the
satisfaction of all. All these agendas are urgent and cannot be
postponed because the life of the nation is at stake.

	   THE Malaysian-sponsored Asean Insurance Training Fund, which was
launched yesterday, will will have access to RM6 million, with
equal contributions from the Government and the local insurance
industry.
	   ``The fund will be sponsor one candidate every year from each
Asean member country to pursue the Diploma in Insurance and Risk
Management course at MII (Malaysian Insurance Institute),'' said
Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd Don.
	   He was speaking at the launching of the Asean Insurance Training
Fund and the inauguration of the 1998 MII Annual Lecture in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   MII has sent applications for the scholarships to the respective
insurance bodies in Asean countries - Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines.
	   For the first year, the fund will offer scholarships valued at
RM13,500 each to cover the fees for the course, which is expected
to begin next month.
	   The diploma is accredited by the Chartered Institute of
Insurance London.
	   The Asean Insurance Training Fund was initiated by Malaysia at
the first Asean finance ministers' meeting held in Phuket,
Thailand, in March last year.
	   It was made due to the need to increase the number of qualified
and well-trained personnel to sustain the growth and progress of
the insurance industry in Asean.
	   ``The fund is provided by the local insurance industry with a
ringgit-for-ringgit matching grant by the (Malaysian) Government.
	   ``It is the Government's aspiration that the Fund will be one of
the many platforms through which Asean member countries will build
expertise in insurance and at the same time foster closer
relationship among the insurance players in the region,'' said
Ahmad.
	   It will be providing 75 scholarships to the MII over the next
five years.
	   In addition, the Asean Insurance Training Fund will also be
sponsoring short technical courses in various subjects.
	   ``These short courses are expected to attract not less than 300
participants from the region over the five-year period,'' said
Ahmad.
	   Meanwhile, MII chairman of education committees Adrian Loh said
upon completion of the diploma programme, students would also be
placed in the local insurance companies to gain some experience.
	   ``The (Asean Insurance Training Fund) scheme is just a
kick-start.
	   Hopefully we can encourage other bodies to come up with ways to
create more insurance professionals,'' he said.

	   SPORTS Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin yesterday unveiled a
limited edition RM50 polymer banknotes to commemorate the Kuala
Lumpur Commonwealth Games - and then took a swipe at the national
hockey team.
	   ``They have been a letdown. Before the World Cup, we had
targetted them to at least make the semifinals of the KL Games.
	   ``But after their poor finishing at the World Cup in Utrecht,
the team clearly needs a serious overhaul.''
	   Muhyiddin will request the National Sports Council (NSC) to have
a meeting with the Malaysian HF to review the debacle. He is even
willing to attend the meeting.
	   His call for a review came a day after German coach Paul Lissek
said he will drop `a few passengers' from the team when he takes
over from Volker Knapp on June 12.
	   Malaysia won one match in the World Cup - against Poland - to
finish second from the bottom.
	   ``Lissek will have to work hand-in-hand with the local coaches
to get the team in shape for the Commonwealth Games. Canada,
Australia, Pakistan and England will be featuring in the Games and
it will be embarrassing if Malaysia are hammered at home in
September,'' said Muhyiddin.
	   On ticket sales, Sukom Ninety Eight Berhad executive chairman
Tan Sri Hashim Ali said their request to the Commonwealth Games
Federation (CGF) to conduct direct overseas sales has been
rejected.
	   ``CGF feel that for now, Sukom should let the Commonwealth Games
Associations conduct the sales and if the sales are still slow,
only then will they step in,'' said Hashim.
	   It is understood that sales in Australia have been slow because
the Australian CGA are selling the tickets as a package deal, which
includes accommodation and travel.

Boyd to stay on Jamaica roster 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Striker Walter Boyd, criticized by
coach Rene Simoes for his recent play and for missing team
appearances, will be on Jamaica's 22-man squad to the World Cup,
Simoes said.
	   Simoes said Tuesday that the temperamental Boyd apologized for
his play and for missing fitness training and team publicity
sessions.
	   ``Walter Boyd is unique and I understand that. I never ever said
he was not a talented player,'' Simoes said. ``It was always a
disciplinary problem.
	   Boyd didn't play during an embarrassing warmup match with a
Caribbean all-star team at Giants Stadium in the U.S. state of New
Jersey on Sunday. Jamaica lost 2-1.
	   ``His mum called, his sister called, his brother called me ...
but let me tell you, it was my decision and nobody else's,'' Simoes
said.
	   The squad was leaving Jamaica for France Wednesday. It faces
Croatia on June 14 in Lins.

Mihajlovic scores only goal as Yugoslavia beats Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's
second-half goal gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over fellow World
Cup qualifier Japan in an evenly balanced friendly match Wednesday.
	   Hidetoshi Nakata of Bellmare Hiratsuka missed two good chances
for Japan before Sinisa, who plays for Italian club Sampdoria,
scored for Yugoslavia in the 71st minute.
	   It was Japan's final warm-up match against another national
side. Yugoslavia plays non-qualifier Switzerland in Basel Saturday.
	   There was equal action at both ends of the pitch in the first
half, with Yugoslavia looking dangerous on corners.
	   Yugoslavia, coached by Slobodan Santrac, faces the United
States, Germany and Iran in its qualification group in France.
	   Japan, under Takeshi Okada, plays Argentina, Croatia and
Jamaica. The team has been training behind closed doors at its base
in the lakeside town of Nyon.

Germany's deadliest rail accidents 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   The high-speed train crash Wednesday was the deadliest in
Germany in 23 years. The following is a list of serious rail
accidents in the country over the past three decades:
	   Feb. 2, 1990: Two elevated inner-city trains crash in
Ruesselsheim, near Frankfurt, after train driver misses stop
signal. 17 killed, 72 injured.
	   June 8, 1975: Two express trains collide in the southern state
of Bavaria. 41 killed, 122 injured.
	   Nov. 5, 1973: Trains collide on line between Kassel and Bebra.
14 killed, 65 injured.
	   Oct. 27, 1971: Small train carrying children on field trip
collides with freight train because of signal failure. 46 killed,
25 injured.
	   July 21, 1971: Train ``Swiss Express'' derails rounding curve
near Freiburg. Technical problems blamed. 23 killed, 143 injured.
	   Feb. 9, 1971: Train derails while rounding curve in the Allgaeu,
Bavaria's Alpine region near the Austrian border. Brake failure
probable cause. 28 killed, 42 injured.
	   July 6, 1967: A half-closed barrier at a rail junction near
Magdeburg strikes a rail tank car with 15,000 liters of gasoline,
causing it to explode and the train to catch fire. There were 94
dead, the worst rail accident in Germany since World War II.

	   PLAYER POWER is becoming an increasingly used phrase in Premier
One this season.
	   If Perak and Selangor's problems with their players aren't
enough, Negri Sembilan, too, seem to be suffering from this as
well.
	   Word has it that a petition, initiated by some players, to
remove coach M. Karathu, has been passed around to gain support.
	   The Negri FA, who became aware of the petition, held a meeting
with the players yesterday, and warned them not to indulge in
politics.
	   NSFA secretary Abdullah Sani Abdul Hamid told them that they
should instead concentrate on helping the team win honours.
	   ``We are not accusing any player, coach or others but NSFA hope
the players will devote their time to the game and try to improve
on the team's performance,'' he said after meeting the players at
the NSFA office.
	   ``We hope that concerned parties (involved in the petition)
would leave the team alone and let them get on with their job.''
	   While Abdullah did not say when the petition first made the
rounds, it is learnt that it was circulated after Negri's 1-0
defeat by Sarawak in Kuching on May 23.
	   The players were so confident they would succeed in removing
Karathu that a foreign coach was believed to have contacted NSFA
about taking the position.
	   The management, however, are solidly behind Karathu.
	   Abdullah has urged Negri fans to rally behind the team. He
described the banner which came up after Negri lost to Pahang on
Saturday as `distasteful'.
	   ``What the team needs is support from the fans, not calls to
replace Karathu. This is putting everyone under pressure but the
fact is the team aren't doing too badly.
	   ``We are sixth and from the way we have been playing, I am
confident we can improve further.''
	   Negri get a chance to climb up the table when they face Pahang,
who were rather fortunate to walk away with maximum points on
Saturday, at Paroi Stadium tonight.
	   The good news for Karathu is that striker Scott Ollerenshaw will
be back but B. Rajnikandh and Halim Jantan are both out.
	   ``Raizuwah (Idris) will play in place of Rajnikandh while I
think I will start with Isham Ismail and Ollerenshaw upfront.''
	   Isham scored Negri's consolation goal against Pahang last
Saturday.
	   Despite Pahang's red-hot form, it is not impossible for Negri to
beat them.
	   ``We could have pulled it off if we had converted the numerous
chances that came our way on Saturday.''
	   Karathu hopes Ollerenshaw's return will beef up their attack.
	   Ollerenshaw has been equally guilty of missing some crucial
chances and if he can strike form tonight, Negri will have an even
chance of beating the Vachislav Melnikov-powered Pahang.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States will allocate an
additional dlrs 5 million to Georgia this year to help 38,000
refugees who fled fighting in the breakaway region of Abkhazia,
officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Stephen Sestanovich announced the new
aid after meeting with Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
other officials late Tuesday.
	   The United States will raise its aid to Georgia this year from
dlrs 100 million to dlrs 160 million, and dlrs 5 million of the new
funds will be earmarked for the refugees, Shevardnadze spokesman
Vakhtang Abashidze said.
	   Abashidze did not say what the rest of the new aid would be used
for.
	   The European Union will also provide dlrs 180,000 for the
refugees, said EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek,
who met with Shevardnadze on Wednesday.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
300,000 ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war, and fighting
erupts frequently in the region.
	   About 38,000 ethnic Georgians who only recently returned to
their homes in Abkhazia fled again during fighting May 19-25.
	   More than 300 Abkhazians and 16 Georgians were killed in those
clashes between Abkhazian armed units and Georgian guerrillas,
Shevardnadze has said.
	   Meanwhile, the executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States met with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba on
Wednesday to discuss possibilities for a peace settlement.
	   Boris Berezovsky the left for Georgian capital Tbilisi to
discuss the meeting with Shevardnadze, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Abkhazia insists it is an independent state. Georgia says it
will grant the region broad autonomy, but not sovereignty.
	   Georgian and Abkhazian presidential envoys were meeting in
Moscow on Wednesday to try to arrange direct talks between
Shevardnadze and Ardzinba.
	   They also discussed a mine blast Tuesday in the buffer zone,
which killed six police officers and employees of the Abkhazian
Security Service, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Abkhazian security chief Astamur Tarba accused Georgian secret
services of planting the mine, while Georgian officials suggested
it was a ``provocation'' designed to scuttle the peace process.

	   PENANG will hire a new foreigner to replace Brazilian midfielder
Fabio Da Silva, who suffered a torn ligament against Kedah last
Saturday.
	   Penang FA deputy president Datuk Dr Ibrahim Saad said: ``I feel
very sad to miss his (Da Silva) services. He has played very well
thus far.''
	   Da Silva, who joined Penang this season, was rushed to a private
hospital on Saturday night and is expected to be out for at least
six months.
	   Penang coach Moey Yoke Ham has called on his players to put the
mishap at the back of their minds and go all out against Kedah in
Alor Star tonight.
	   ``The players cannot just stop and groan about it,'' said Moey.
``We must remain positive.''
	   Moey's concern is understandable as Penang will meet Kedah again
today in the second round in Alor Star.
	   They lost by a narrow one-goal margin last Saturday.

India tests naval version of surface-to-air missile 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India tested an indigenous naval version
of the ``Trishul'' surface-to-air missile Wednesday, the Defense
Ministry said.
	   The naval version could be used as a surface-to-air missile
against aircraft and as a counter to sea-skimming missiles, the
ministry said in a statement.
	   It was flight tested for the first time from naval ship INS
Dronacharya in the southern city of Cochin, some 2,500 kilometers
(1,500 miles) southwest of New Delhi, it said.
	   Trishul (Trident) already has been tested several times for use
by the army and the air force. The missile, which uses solid fuel,
has a range of up to 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) and can carry a
warhead of 15 kilograms (33 pounds).
	   India tested five underground nuclear devices May 11-13 and is
perfecting a delivery system.
	   A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, India's top defense scientist, recently said
the government has approved increasing the range of the
intermediate-range Agni missile, which it tested before, but halted
two years ago following pressure from the United States.
	   Agni was tested to a range of 1,550 miles (2,480 kilometers),
enough to reach Shanghai or Beijing in neighboring China. India
says it needs a nuclear defense against China and its other
neighbor Pakistan, both nuclear powers.
	   In the last two years, India also has tested a short-range
ballistic Prithvi (Earth) missile with a range of 150 kilometers
(95 miles). A longer-range version was test-fired in January.
	   Prithvi is believed to be ready to be deployed on the western
border. India has fought Pakistan in three wars since 1948 and
still engages in frequent border skirmishes. India and China fought
a war in 1962.

	   STUDENTS from Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungei Lui in Ulu Langat,
Kajang, took part in the Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Future Grads
Contest.
	   KL Mutual Bangsar branch manager Khoo Peng Seng gave the school
50 free copies of the New Straits Times for the five days of the
contest.
	   Khoo said: ``The sponsorship of the papers is our way of
promoting reading among the pupils.''
	   New Straits Times is the official newspaper for the contest.
	   English teacher Siti Saadah Mohamad Shariff said she likes using
the paper as it gives students a chance to learn new words. ``It is
also useful for them to learn about important events,'' she said.
	   She added that she will distribute the papers to students during
classes.
	   ``Usually, the students are only able to refer to the New
Straits Times in the library, and we also have some copies for the
teachers,'' she said.
	   KL Mutual is spending RM250,000 to organise the contest, which
was held last week, with the finals in July.
	   Selected schools were given 50 copies of the newspaper during
the contest.
	   Other schools keen on participating in the contest bought the
newspapers from the New Straits Times Press.
	   Three general knowledge questions on mathematics, science,
history, geography, sports, entertainment and current affairs were
published in the newspaper, together with the contest form.
	   Participants must answer all 15 questions and write a slogan.
	   Twelve finalists will be selected for the finals to be held at
the Subang Parade shopping complex in Subang Jaya on July 5.
	   The first prize is RM5,000, the second RM3,000, the third
RM2,000 and nine fourth prizes each worth RM1,000.
	   All prizes will be in the form of unit trust accounts.
	   There are also 50 consolation prizes.

EBC Securities Given Until July to Clean Up Operations, BUSINESS DAILY

	   The Securities and Exchange Commission has given suspended
brokerage firm EBC Securities Inc. until July this year to put in
order its operations or face the prospect of permanent revocation
of its license to operate.
	   Elizabeth Martin, head of the SEC's brokers and exchange
department (BED), said they believe that two months is enough for
EBC Securities to correct the violations committed.
	   ``They initially asked for one year, but we said one to two
months will do.
	   If they don't clean up their act we will not renew their license
to operate when it expires on Dec. 31 this year,'' Martin said.
	   The SEC earlier suspended the operations of EBC Securities after
a regular audit revealed several grave violations of the Revised
Securities Act (RSA).
	   The suspension order, handed down by the SEC-BED, had
effectively put on hold all trading operations of the brokerage
firm since May 12.
	   The audit showed that EBC Securities had a net capital
deficiency, erroneous information forms, and client claims which
did not match the book of accounts of the firm.
	   Although their identities were not disclosed, five other
brokerage firms are currently being investigated by the BED.
	   In the second half of last year, the SEC imposed one of the
stiffest penalties against a brokerage house when it fined R.
Coyiuto Securities Inc. P625,000 for violation of the net capital
rule.
	   Angelito Ramos, accounting department head of EBC Securities,
earlier claimed that the SEC made a mistake in its computation of
the firms net capital.
	   ``The SEC erroneously computed the picking of balance due to
customers while the forms belonged to old clients who are now
non-existent,'' Ramos said.
	   He explained that the documents in question belonged to clients
of former EBC Securities head Agustin Bautista, who allegedly
stashed away the documents after resigning from his post.
	   While Ramos did not give any specifics on losses suffered by the
firm since the suspension, EBC Securities is currently ranked in
the lower 100 among member-brokers of the Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) and only operates on a retail basis.
	   EBC Securities, which started trading at the local bourse in
1990, is now down to only four staff members including the firm's
president, Genevieve Go.
	   The brokerage firm has a reputation of striking one-time deals
amounting to millions of pesos.

Indonesia may field smaller team in Asiad, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): The National Sports Council is considering a
sizable cut in the Indonesian team for the Asian Games in Bangkok
in December due to many sports' poor preparations.
	   The council official in charge of athletes' development,
Muhammad Hindarto, said yesterday that only five out of 21 sports
organizations selected to conduct training sessions for the Games
had made progress.
	   ``As of this moment only athletes from track and field,
badminton, weightlifting, shooting and tennis have assured
themselves of places in the national contingent for the Asiad,''
Hindarto said.
	   He said the sluggish preparations of all but the five above
sports bodies had caused worries over their chances to bring home
medals in the quadrennial event.
	   Some sports organizations have complained about financial
shortages to finance their centralized training sessions, but
Hindarto said such an excuse was intolerable.
	   ``We set the schedule and program a long time before the
economic recession. Then officials of the sports bodies agreed to
cover half of the training expenses.
	   ``They cannot just breach their commitments and leave us
scrapping their athletes from the national team. That's unfair,''
Hindarto said.
	   He said the sports council had disbursed subsidies for the
sports organizations before the training stint for the Asian Games
officially kicked off in February.
	   Indonesia's preparations for the Asiad have been estimated at at
least Rp 15 billion (US$135,000). One fifth of the amount has been
covered by the government.
	   As if to add insult to injury, some of the sports organizations
which failed to begin their training programs on time have also
failed to provide the sports council with their regular reports,
according to Hindarto.
	   ``It's too bad because this make us totally blind as to their
performance,'' he said.
	   The sports council announced in February that Indonesia would
take part in 21 sports, including soccer, cycling, boxing, rowing,
canoeing, karate, sepak takraw, wushu, swimming and archery.
	   The final lineup of the Indonesian team will be announced in
November.
	   Despite the slimmer contingent, Hindarto said Indonesia could
improve on its performance from the last Asiad in Hiroshima because
only potential medal winners would leave for Bangkok.
	   Then Indonesia's 151-strong team won three golds, 12 silvers and
11 bronzes.
	   ``The most important thing is that we participate and improve on
our previous achievement, not necessarily become the number one
nation,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR seem to be enjoying a new lease of life since
`Ironman' Mat Zan Mat Aris took over as coach, winning two
consecutive matches. But life in the second round won't be easy.
	   While many agree that the decision to release Nigerians Adebisi
Ogunsanya and Abu Bakar Balarabe is correct, KL will not be able to
sign replacements unless they qualify for the Malaysia Cup.
	   The deadline for changes was Saturday but Mat Zan is not worried
about having to chart KL's revival with just one foreign player -
Brazilian Adilson Roque.
	   ``We have to depend on the local players to deliver and I am
confident they can do it,'' said Mat Zan yesterday.
	   ``They have proved themselves in the five matches I have been in
charge.
	   They have to carry on doing that.''
	   It won't be a walk in the park as Mat Zan admitted.
	   ``Take Perak, for instance. We may have beaten them on Saturday
but tomorrow (today) will be a totally different game.''
	   Perak's run of three consecutive defeats has been attributed to
players revolting against coach Karl Weigang.
	   They have not been playing to instructions but with Weigang
leaving for Paris on Wednesday to receive Fifa's Order of Merit,
many expect the Perak players to return to their winning ways.
	   Mat Zan certainly expects a fight. ``But we have shown that if
we try, we can win matches. It will be an uphill task but Perak can
expect us to give our best.''
	   Anything less will have severe repercussions for KL, who
qualified for the Malaysia Cup for the first time in five years
last season.
	   They have to start collecting points if they hope to see
Malaysia Cup action again without having to go through the lottery
process of playing a qualifying round.

	   PALIBURG Group plans to release the first batch of 100 Park
Royale residential units at an average price of $2,834 per square
foot, about 10 to 15 per cent below the prevailing market price.
	   Director of Paliburg Holdings Donald Fan said the group would
provide 10 special offers, including the sale of residential units
and parking spaces at special discounted prices, complimentary
legal fees, one complimentary parking space for the first buyer
and, pre-approved personal loans from $100,000 to $500,000, in
order to attract buyers.
	   In addition, a minimum 10 per cent down payment and other
favourable payment terms would also be available.
	   Park Royale, in Yuen Long, consists of ten 12-storey towers of
632 residential units from 650 to 950 sq ft and 48 duplex units and
penthouses of 1,600 to 2,000 sq ft.
	   Mr Fan said if all the units were sold, more than $2 billion
would be generated for the group.
	   He said the first batch of units was reasonably priced, adding
that since the development was scheduled for completion by early
1999, the group must offer a discount to buyers.
	   Mr Fan said the project was still viable for the group because
the average launch price of $2,834 per sq ft covered the $1,300 per
sq ft construction cost and $900 per sq ft land cost.
	   Sales registration will run from 6-10 June and the public sale
is scheduled for 13 June.
	   Mr Fan said Paliburg would benefit from the government's
relaxation of anti-speculation measures.
	   He said its two projects _ in Yuen Long and Stanley _ would be
put up for sale in advance during 1999.
	   The $1.3 billion luxury residential villa project in Stanley is
comprised of 133 houses ranging in size from 3,000-6,000 sq ft.
	   The development is scheduled for launch during the second half
of next year at a likely price of $14,000 per sq ft.

International Development Bank promoting fight against violence of president to Armando Calderon Sol

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ The Inter-American Development
Bank is urging Latin American leaders to fervently fight the
violence plaguing much of the region in order to strengthen their
economies.
	   ``Violence is not a biblical curse,'' bank president Enrique
Iglesias said at the start of a meeting on public security.
``Violence is not only repugnant to all civilized society but an
excess that cannot be permitted in Latin America.''
	   Bank experts estimate that violence costs Latin America nations
at least dlrs 15 billion annually.
	   In 1996, there were 140,000 homicides in Latin America, a rate
of 30 deaths for every 100,000 people which is the highest for any
region in the world, Iglesias said.
	   ``We are in the presence of a special theme that has major
social, political and economic repercussions,'' he said.
	   A recent study by the University of Central America showed that
in 1995, violence cost El Salvador dlrs 777 million _ or 13 percent
of the gross national product.
	   El Salvador's President Armando Calderon Sol said Monday that
the country's crime problem has been one of the major headaches of
his administration.
	   El Salvador suffers a homicide rate of more than 100 killings
per 100,000 citizens. Colombia, long considered the most violent
nations in Latin America, had a homicide rate of 81 per 100,000 in
1996, the latest figures available.
	   The Inter-American Development Bank already has extended credit
to Colombia and Uruguay to help fight violence.
	   ``We are proud to serve not only as a credit agency but as a
source of social promotion, Iglesias said. ``In the last few years
we have dedicated more than half of our resources to fight poverty
and the social problems that stem from it.''
	   More than 500 regional leaders and international experts are
attending the session, including representatives from across the
Americas and Europe.

Butler to lay out ``road map'' for Iraq to follow to end of sanctions 
</HEADLINE>

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With pressure mounting to speed arms
inspections, the chief U.N. inspector is presenting evidence
Wednesday to the Security Council to try to justify his claim that
Iraq is still hiding illegal weapons.
	   During the closed-door meeting, which began Wednesday morning
and is expected to last most of the day, Richard Butler is also
expected to lay out a ``road map'' of specific steps Baghdad must
take to comply with U.N. disarmament orders and bring an end to
nearly eight years of crippling economic sanctions.
	   U.N. officials said Butler will provide aerial photos and
technical materials to argue that Iraq has failed to account for
all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological
materials it is believed to have held before the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Destroying those materials is the main condition for the council
to lift sanctions imposed in August 1990 after President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
	   Officials of the U.N. Special Commission, which perform
inspections, have appeared frequently before the council since
1991. But U.N. officials said Butler is expected to provide far
more technical information and detailed evidence than in previous
presentations because of pressure within the council to bring the
program to an end.
	   Russian, Chinese and French diplomats are expected to question
him intensively and in some instance challenge his conclusions.
Those countries have spearheaded a bid within the council to
accelerate inspections so that sanctions can be lifted.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said he expected the meeting to
produce ``a higher level of technical literacy'' among council
diplomats regarding Iraq's weapons programs.
	   ``These are complex matters and it's important they be
understood,'' Weston said. ``I think it's important that the Iraqis
themselves understand what's needed.''
	   On Tuesday, the council listened to an Iraqi delegation, led by
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argue that it has
complied with U.N. orders and that sanctions should be ended.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as
Saddam remains in power. British and American diplomats said Iraq
provided no new information about its weapons programs.
	   Pressure has increased on Butler's teams since Secretary-General
Kofi Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open
Saddam's palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.
	   U.N. inspectors have not visited any palaces or other sensitive
sites since April 2 for fear that failure to find any weapons
caches will only undermine their argument that Iraq has still not
come clean.

	   Duty-free shop operations will soon be limited to
government-owned Duty Free Philippines stores in international
ports and fenced-in areas of freeport zones upon the conclusion of
Philippine Centennial celebration this month.
	   Executive Order (EO) 444, which was signed in September 1997,
calls for, among others, the phase-out of private-owned duty free
shops and restrictions on the expansion of existing ones
established within and outside the international ports.
	   EO 444 has given privately owned duty-free shops in the country
until the conclusion of the celebration of Philippine independence
to operate.
	   President Ramos noted that the operation of duty free shops and
outlets in the Subic Freeport and the Clark Special Economic Zone
was needed to enhance domestic tourism and help generate support
for the Centennial celebration ``under proper and strict
limitations.''
	   Through EO 444, government can curb abuses reported to have
emanated from the operation of duty-free shops, as well as plug the
loopholes on importation.
	   The directive, in effect, also sets to limit the privileges of
duty-free shopping to travelers. This means that residents living
in Subic and Clark will no longer enjoy the $100 duty-free shopping
privilege.
	   The order also covers what type of goods the duty free stores
will be allowed to sell. Upon effectivity of the order, non-durable
products will no longer be allowed to be sold to privilege holders.
The directive also restricts the selling of certain ecozone
products like rice and sugar.
	   There are at least 19 private-owned duty free shops operating in
Clark and some 15 in Cebu City.

	   A WAR of words flared up yesterday between the Securities and
Futures Commission and Morgan Stanley Asia over the latter's
alleged breach of SFC regulations.
	   The row erupted after the SFC issued a press statement yesterday
at noon, reprimanding Morgan Stanley Asia for its failure to
disclose to investors information relevant to plans by China
Everbright IHD-Pacific Ltd to acquire a stake in Everbright Bank of
China and IHD's subsequent placement of shares.
	   The SFC said that, in May last year, Morgan Stanley Asia failed
to inform the public that relevant Beijing authorities were about
to permit IHD to buy a stake in the bank. The SFC claimed Morgan
Stanley Asia did not fulfil its regulatory responsibility.
	   But late yesterday afternoon, the investment banker countered by
issuing its own press statement denying it had violated regulatory
guidelines. It said no such guidelines existed.
	   ``We are of the view that we did not violate any regulatory
guidelines and made all the disclosures required of it by law,''
Morgan Stanley Asia said.
	   The denial caught the SFC by surprise as it believed the
reprimand had been agreed upon by both parties.
	   ``Frankly we're very shocked,'' said Mark Dickens, the SFC's
executive director of enforcement.
	   ``We spent this morning checking the wording of the release with
them and we have no doubt that their obligation was described in
the rule books.'' Mr Dickens said at no stage during the talks did
Morgan Stanley Asia give any indication they were unhappy with the
decision.
	   Mr Dickens said that the negotiations with Morgan Stanley Asia
took place at the company's request.
	   ``It involved a series of meetings with them and their lawyers
and it was very carefully discussed, so we're quite happy we're on
firm ground,'' he said.
	   Following Morgan Stanley Asia's decision to issue a press
statement, the SFC countered with another public statement which
expressed regret at the company's ``attempt at public exoneration
without reference to the commission's written decision which was 14
pages in length which fully discussed the evidence gathered by the
SFC, Morgan Stanley's representations and the reasons for the SFC
reaching the conclusions it did''.
	   The SFC disputed the investment banker's assertion that ``there
were no regulatory guidelines for a situation similar to the one
Morgan Stanley and its clients were facing''.
	   The SFC said it has taken similar action against other firms in
related situations.
	   The watchdog has called into question Morgan Stanley Asia's
fitness to remain registered and its ability to adhere to very high
standards expected of financial advisers.
	   Mr Dickens said there was no question of more regulations or
getting the Financial Services Bureau involved in the issue.
	   ``The issue it raises is: What is the point of a system where
players don't respect the umpires' decision even after due
process?'' he said.
	   Morgan Stanley Asia did not indicate if it was going to pursue
the issue.

	   THE decision by the Government to push ahead with plans to
develop the aerospace sector may seem rather incongruous at this
point of time. The economy, many would argue, has just registered
its first negative quarterly growth in gross domestic product in
more than a decade and Malaysia Airlines, the national carrier and
the foremost aviation player in the country, flew smack into the
red during its last financial year.
	   With no end to the current economic crisis in sight, many would
have thought Malaysia would decide to hold back its aerospace
programme until a time when the economy is back on its track again.
	   Those favouring a rethink on the part of the policy-makers on
this issue would point to the fact that aerospace is an industry
that requires heavy capital investment and long gestation periods.
With the economy struggling from the effects of the regional
financial crisis, there are more than a few concerns more immediate
to the people and the country than building airplanes or launching
more satellites, some may say. Apart from that, there is also the
question of how to revive the existing players in the aerospace
industry. How do we turn the national carrier around? Several
smaller airline companies that were created during the good times,
including Air Asia, Seaega and Pelangi Air, are not in too good a
shape either and would need nursing back to health. Another
airline, Asia Pacific Airways, has closed shop.
	   The country's foray into aircraft manufacturing, which had a
good start with the manufacturing of the Eagle trainers, has also
been affected since the financial crisis broke out last year. Even
Malaysia's own satellite in the sky, the Measat, is not immune from
the effects of the crisis as its owner, Binariang, seeks foreign
partners to help ease its finances. The detestable ambience is
taking its toll to the extent that the region, particularly the
Association of South-East Asian Nations is no more conducive for
foreign airlines that have already aborted their flights in and out
of its major cities.
	   The other side of the argument is that there are many benefits
from developing the aerospace sector. A systematic development of
the aerospace sector will certainly bear fruit in the long term.
Certainly, we are not talking about competing with Boeing or Airbus
Industrie to make airplanes.
	   But we do buy a lot of aircraft and having a small industry to
supply components and parts, for example, would benefit locals and
save some of the foreign exchange. Even the technology of producing
our own bolts and nuts for the aircraft will gradually save our
foreign exchange. And at the same time, of course, we will
accentuate our vision towards producing the more sophisticated
components of an airplane.
	   The technology employed in aerospace would also help us with our
industrialisation aspiration. The satellite technology, for
example, could take us among the forerunners in the information
age. In an era where the use of satellites brings the world closer
- making it smaller and more accessible - we cannot renege on such
a plan to develop our aerospace industry. Neither do we have to
jettison it. Ironically, it is not the competition in nuclear
technology we are talking about. This is more about applying the
technology to balance our economy and making the people more
knowledgeable so as not to lose track when it comes to competing in
its downstream sector, at least.
	   Aerospace is a high-technology field involving scientists and
experts that an ambitious country like Malaysia must have. In
moving towards realising the objectives of Vision 2020, the
groundwork should start now.
	   Cyberjaya, Putrajaya, the Multimedia Super Corridor and other
related developments must be well equipped with supporting
satellite networks.
	   Without technological applications such as the aerospace, the
whole process will be incomplete. This programme is one of the
major endeavours we have to undertake to ensure smooth passage to
2020. But of course, we need to emulate the best approach in
dealing with it. Any over-zealous implementation will lead to
unpleasant results. We have many dextrous eggheads who are capable
of delineating the suitable aerospace programme for the nation, and
for its people.

	   NATIONAL coach Morten Frost Hansen and five former Malaysian
greats have been inducted into the inaugural Badminton Hall of Fame
in a list released by the International Badminton Federation (IBF)
yesterday.
	   The ceremony to unveil the Hall of Fame at the IBF office in
London will be held at the end of the year.
	   Datuk Eddy Choong, Malaysia's best player in the 50s, was joined
by his brother David, Ng Boon Bee, Tan Yee Khan and Ong Poh Lim.
	   Frost, David Choong, Ng, Tan and Ong were among 10 shuttlers who
were selected after the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup Finals in Hong Kong
last month.
	   Eddy Choong was selected in the first list made in January. The
first list picked the elite from the 50s and 60s.
	   The others included Colonel SSC Dolby, Sir George Thomas, Mrs
Betty Uber and Herbert Scheele, all of whom had been influential in
setting up the IBF and introducing the Thomas and Uber Cups.
	   The others in the list were Rudy Hartono and Dick Sudirman of
Indonesia, Erland Kops and Finn Kobbero of Denmark, Craig Reedie
(Scotland) and Judy Hashman (USA/Ireland).
	   The five selected after the Thomas Cup were Hammergaard Hanson
of Denmark, Muriel Lucas (England), Lene Koppen (Denmark), China
greats Han Aiping and current Uber Cup coach Li Lingwei.
	   IBF vice-president Datuk Punch Gunalan, who released the list in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday, said those inducted into the Hall of Fame
were not selected solely for their performances on court but also
their contributions off it.
	   ``The legends we selected had contributed much to the game and
ensured badminton have had a major following,'' said Gunalan, who
also heads the selection committee.
	   Frost, a former World No 1 and who reached the All-England final
eight consecutive times, said he was grateful to IBF for
considering his inclusion.
	   ``This is something I'll cherish but I cannot sit back and enjoy
it. I have a lot of work to do in preparing the national team for
our assignments.''

	   ALL ITALS EXCEPT TBD - For years, there has been the perception
in much of the public's mind that government was somehow
mishandling the whole issue of petroleum products, a commodity with
highly sensitive economic, social, and political implications.
	   A bankrupt Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF) and a
second-attempt deregulation law later, the industry, and the
related issues are still the subject of much debate. The Business
Daily sought to inquire into the mechanics of the affair by asking
Dr. Cecilio H. Penson, director, Philippine National Oil Co., to
present his views on the matter.
	   ALL BOLD - THE BUSINESS DAILY: For years, oil companies had
protection from competition, a foreign exchange risk cover,
arbitrage, and interest income, among others. Why has government
been so generous to the Big 3?
	   BOLD, NAME ONLY - PENSON - It is a long story. It is speculative
to say that there has been some sort of collusion beween the
management of oil companies and government lead agencies.
	   Nevertheless, if we look at some of the practices, the first
thing that comes to mind is the oil companies' prerogative to
engage in arbitrage.
	   Crude oil is bought on credit, with bills to be paid in, let's
say, 180 days. In the meantime, you put the money in the bank at
around 12% interest. Anyway, the OPSF covered you. While you are
buying on credit you get paid in cash. Nice, isn't it?
	   Then they got themselves dollar-denominated loans. When local
interest rates were high, they borrowed dollars from abroad at 5%,
converted it into pesos and got 12% interest here, all that while
they were buying on credit and had the extra insurance from the
OPSF. They led a privileged existence, no doubt. Why? I don't know.
	   Whenever they filed a claim against the OPSF, they got their
money -that is until the well ran dry.
	   ALL BOLD - What about the pricing system?
	   NORMAL - They do not explain to the country how much is their
actual cost.
	   In the meantime they charge consumers as if they were the ones
who borrowed the money to buy the crude, charging them for the
interest owed as well.
	   All this, while they were covered by the OPSF, mind you.
	   In fairness to the Filipino consumer, let us ask Petron, we
being 40% owner of the company, to show us the elements of their
cost.
	   Petron is almost always the first to ask for an increase in
prices.
	   Never mind their imprudent expenses. There needs to be careful
analysis of what I would call imprudent expenses. ALL BOLD - Is the
consumer paying the ``right'' price? What are the problems under
the current setup?
	   NORMAL - We are not paying the right price. It all comes down to
transparency with regard to their actual cost and analysis of their
imprudent as well as their prudent expenses. I have been mentioning
this during the past three years to the oil and format committee.
Why don't we ask Petron what is the most economical way of
acquiring and processing crude so that we can get lower prices? The
Coalition for Energy Awareness, consumer groups, organized labor,
all of them have some interesting things to say in relation to
that, but nobody seems to mind them. ALL BOLD - How do local
refiners compare to Singapore production in terms of price and
productivity? What can we conclude?
	   NORMAL - They are expensive. Look at ordinary oil refinery
practice. For example again, let's say my partner and I own a
factory for making patis.
	   Before we start production, we have to know what kind of fish
should be used, the kind of freight we use, and what kind of
broiler we must get.
	   But now my partner insists that we use a certain kind of fish
that is more expensive and has to be boiled longer! And, therefore,
the whole process becomes more expensive. Just look at Petron and
you'll see what I mean. It is hard to believe that the Big 3 are
really competing with each other when you look at the quality of
their effort to make things cheaper.
	   Singapore prices should only be used as a basis, but we are
making it a god here.
	   ALL BOLD - You have accused local refiners of wasteful
practices. How did you arrive at these conclusions?
	   NORMAL - They know exactly what crude to use. There is a
comparative study of crude costing. They have laboratories to
figure it out. They insist on buying Arab crude oil that is
sulfur-heavy and costs a lot to process. And the consumer pays for
that policy.
	   ALL BOLD - How big a component in the pricing system are what
you call ``imprudent'' expenses?
	   NORMAL - For every P0.01 revenue, there is 3/4 of that amount in
imprudent expenses.
	   ALL BOLD - Who do you blame for the situation as you see it, and
why?
	   NORMAL - All government agencies are helpless about this,
especially the Energy Regulatory Board during the heyday of the
OPSF madness.
	   ALL BOLD - What needs to be done to get the consumer the best
possible price without taking reasonable profitability away from
oil producers?
	   NORMAL - We are not saying that they (the oil companies) should
not make money. Let them make a profit. If they follow the right
costing with regard to crude supply and processing, they will
double their profits.
	   What is happening is that the Filipino consumer is paying for
their wasteful practices and mismanagement of operations and
resources.
	   ALL BOLD - Does the new oil law still have built-in clauses that
somehow ensure continued domination by the larger players? Is the
playing field really level now? Will competitive pressure be
allowed to work?
	   NORMAL - From the very beginning, almost four years ago, I have
batted for deregulation because I was not not happy with the OPSF
facility. The facility had too many loopholes and unless the
government was well equiped, prepared, and knowledgeable, the
industry had every chance to make a mockery of the system. Even
though the deregulation law is basically a good law, there was
little study made on the subject of how exactly new participants
would enter the market. Without new and strong participants, it is
senseless to talk about competition. There is no change.
	   ALL BOLD - Is there any way to put a price tag, in terms of
money lost or made, on what you believe has been the oil industry's
non-stop party between 1985 and 1997?
	   NORMAL - The oil companies, based on imprudent expenses alone,
owe the Philippines approximately P3 billion over two decades. I
don't think the whole issue should be swept under the table and be
forgotten. Instead, I think it is in the interest of the public
that the matter be vigorously pursued in due time.
	   ALL ITALS - (Dr. Penson has had 30 years experience in the oil
business.
	   He just returned from Houston, Texas, where he attended a
conference of oil traders discussing the impact of oil prices on
the economies of developing countries. - Editor)

	   JAKARTA (JP): The country's financial markets lost ground
yesterday with the rupiah closing lower against the U.S. dollar and
stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) falling 1.5
percent, analysts and dealers said.
	   Currency dealers said a combination of a weaker yen against the
U.S. dollar, worries about the country's political stability and a
gloomy economic outlook brought the rupiah down against the dollar.
	   ``Trading in the rupiah remained thin because most operators
sidelined the market,'' a dealer with a local private bank said.
	   The dealer, however, said that the weaker yen was the dominant
factor in the weakening rupiah.
	   The rupiah, which opened at 11,250 against the dollar, closed at
11,600 on the Jakarta spot market, down on Friday's close of Rp
11.300.
	   According to Dow Jones, the yen was trading at 139.59 against
the dollar yesterday, down from 138.78 last Friday.
	   Dealers said that because the yen was expected to fall to 140
against the dollar, the rupiah was expected to break the Rp 15,000
level against the dollar in the days ahead.
	   ``I think the rupiah will likely test the 12,000 level tomorrow
(today),'' the dealer said.
	   Currency dealers noted that gloomy economic indicators had also
put pressure on the rupiah yesterday.
	   The central bureau of statistics announced yesterday that the
country's gross domestic product shrank by 8.5 percent during the
first quarter of this year and the inflation rate rose to 40.06
percent between January and May.
	   ``Hopes for a quick release of the IMF loan package and good
results on debt talks were overshadowed by these negative
factors,'' the dealer said.
	   While the rupiah was weakening, stock prices on the JSX fell 1.5
percent. The index was dragged down by blue chip stocks and stocks
linked to the Soeharto clan, brokers said.
	   The JSX Composite Index closed 6.38 points lower at 414.07 on a
total turnover of 157.92 million shares worth Rp 146.27 billion
(US$12.72 million).
	   A broker with Trimegah Securindo Lestari said that trading on
the local bourse remained lethargic for the whole day because most
investors were still reluctant to enter the market.
	   ``Trading activity was quiet because investors did not want to
take any position,'' he said.
	   He said that most foreign investors continued to off-load stocks
linked to former president Soeharto's family and cronies on the
grounds that such holdings would not bear any fruits.
	   Shares in Bimantara Citra, controlled by Soeharto's second son
Bambang Trihatmodjo, fell Rp 100 to Rp 350 on a total turnover of
9.77 million shares, while shares in toll-road operator Citra Marga
Nusaphala Persada (CMNP), controlled by Soeharto's eldest daughter
Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, closed unchanged at Rp 375 on a total
turnover of 7.23 million shares.
	   An analyst at Harita Securities said foreign investors did not
yet feel secure enough to place funds in the country's dire market
for fear that political instability would further worsen.
	   ``Some foreign investors are still asking whether the country's
political situation has returned to normal,'' the analyst said.

	   ATHLETES competing in the Commonwealth Games in September can be
assured their health will not be at risk, reports Hanizah Hashim
Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said yesterday that although
there have been an increase in haze-related health problems over
the last year, the total impact on the health of the population was
minimal.
	   Chua, speaking to reporters after welcoming participants of the
`Biregional Workshop on Health Impacts of Haze-Related Air
Pollution' at the Institute for Medical Research, said studies
conducted by the Ministry's Centre for Disease Control showed an
increase of 20 per cent in acute respiratory infections, 30 per
cent increase in asthma cases and 15 per cent increase in
conjunctivitis during that period.
	   He said the increase in the number of cases was considered
statistically insignificant. He added that prompt medical attention
was given to patients who sought treatment. Chua said: ``The
episodic haze is much less harmful than the perennial smog found in
many cities in industrialised countries and has much less
deleterious effects on health.''

Israel's state lottery to challenge gambling law, open casino 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel may become the next gambling hot spot on
the Mediterranean, if the state lottery gets its way.
	   In a challenge to the country's gambling laws which prohibit
casinos, the state lottery said Wednesday it was planning to build
a casino, Army radio said.
	   Israel's tourism ministry supported the idea, saying it could
generate millions of dollars in revenue and create much needed
jobs.
	   But not everyone thought it was a good idea.
	   Avraham Ravitz, a religious lawmaker, called gambling immoral
and said it threatened to harm Jewish morals.
	   ``We will not allow for it'' Ravitz said. ``It corrupts life,
values, and society.''
	   Israelis used to travel in droves to nearby Turkey to gamble
until it was outlawed there several months ago.

	   MOBILE phone service provider Sunday yesterday undercut its
competitor's new tariff rates, a move which could trigger a price
war among Personal Communication System (PCS) operators.
	   Sunday's tariff cut comes only five days after New World PCS 009
launched its new tariff plans, which includes a package of 100
minutes of talk-time for $138 per month and $188 for 200 minutes of
air-time per month, previously the lowest tariff plans among the
six PCS operators.
	   Sunday has undercut New World by introducing a single tariff
plan of $88 for 100 minutes of talk-time, effective today.
	   Hutchison Telecom also announced a promotional offer for new
subscribers yesterday.
	   Any customer with a handset joining the network will receive a
$480 cash coupon which can be used over 12 monthly fee instalments.
	   With a standard rate of $120 for 120 minutes of talk-time and a
cash coup on of $480, Hutchison PCS customers would be paying only
$80 for 120 minutes of air-time on the first year of subscription.
	   A spokeswoman for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings said the
group has no immediate plan to change the tariff plans for its PCS
network.
	   SmarTone acquired the P-Plus PCS network in March and charges
the second-highest tariff among PCS operators after 1+1
Communications with a rate of $168 for 100 minutes talk-time.
	   SmarTone chief executive Hubert Ng has said that ``prices will
continue to drop while services improve''.
	   Analysts said it is not surprising to see operators lowering
tariff to maintain growth and market share.
	   New subscribers growth has slowed since the beginning of the
year.
	   Sunday managing director Craig Ehrlich said they want to stay
ahead of the market by offering the best prices and best service.
``The new tariff is designed to make every day as easy as Sunday
for our subscribers. Not only is it cheaper, but it's still so easy
to understand because there is only one plan,'' he said.
	   The entry fee of just $88 for 100 minutes talk-time and the
special offer for medium-to-high end users are the two most
attractive aspects of the new tariff plan, the group said.
	   Every subscriber who uses more than 400 minutes per month will
receive 600 minutes free. That means they are only paying $388 for
1,000 minutes.
	   With around 82,000 subscribers as at the end of March, Sunday
plans to have 140,000 to 150,000 customers by the end of this year.
	   In addition, Sunday IDD has also cut its tariff by up to 59 per
cent.

Bre-X president suffers severe stroke after Bahamian court freezes assets 
</HEADLINE>
By JESSICA ROBERTSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The president of Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the
Canadian company that collapsed in the world's biggest gold-mining
scam, suffered a severe stroke after a Bahamian judge ordered all
his assets frozen.
	   David Walsh, 52, is comatose at a private hospital in Nassau,
the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
	   ``His condition is very critical,'' Kelly Knowles, a spokeswoman
for the private Doctors Hospital, said Wednesday. She refused to
give details.
	   On Friday, the Bahamas Supreme Court froze all the assets of
Walsh and his wife, Jeanette, at the request of the trustees
handling the bankruptcy.
	   Walsh collapsed Sunday in Nassau, where he had moved to a
seaside estate in March 1997, eight months before investigators
discovered that claims of a dlrs 24 billion gold discovery in
Borneo, Indonesia, were fake.
	   Stock in Bre-X, which had been billed as the gold find of the
century, collapsed from dlrs 206 a share. Thousands of investors
lost an estimated dlrs 6 billion.
	   Lawsuits have been filed in Canada, the United States, the
Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, where Bre-X vice-president John
Felderhof, who also was the company's senior geologist, moved after
the scandal broke.
	   Private investigators said the company's chief geologist,
Michael de Guzman, apparently committed suicide in March 1997 by
jumping from a helicopter near the Busang mine.
	   Investigators suggested de Guzman, who ran the project site, may
have masterminded the scam by secretly buying gold from local
miners and using it to doctor rock samples dug up at the
exploration site.
	   Walsh and Felderhof have declared their innocence and said they
want to clear their names.
	   The chartered accountant firm Deloitte and Touche, named
trustees in the bankruptcy, asked the Bahamian court to freeze the
Walsh's assets to recover funds to reimburse creditors of Bre-X.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's
second-half goal gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over fellow World
Cup qualifier Japan in an evenly balanced friendly match Wednesday.
	   Hidetoshi Nakata of Bellmare Hiratsuka missed two good chances
for Japan before Sinisa, who plays for Italian club Sampdoria,
scored for Yugoslavia in the 71st minute.
	   It was Japan's final warm-up match against another national
side. Yugoslavia plays non-qualifier Switzerland in Basel Saturday.
	   There was equal action at both ends of the pitch in the first
half, with Yugoslavia looking dangerous on corners.
	   Yugoslavia, coached by Slobodan Santrac, faces the United
States, Germany and Iran in its qualification group in France.

Clinton proposes renewing normal trade relations with China 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: Combines pvs; editing to tighten; no pickup
By TOM RAUM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Opening an annual battle with Congress,
President Clinton Wednesday proposed renewing normal trade
relations with China, saying ``this policy is clearly in our
nation's interest.''
	   Announcing his decision in the Rose Garden, Clinton said that
failure to renew normal trade ties would sever the United States'
economic and strategic relationship with Beijing.
	   Further, he said it would amount to ``turning our back on a
fourth of the world at a time when our cooperation for world peace
and security is specially important in light of the recent events
in South Asia.'' He was referring to nuclear tensions between India
and Pakistan.
	   Many in Congress oppose the president's policy. This year's
battle is complicated by questions about the administration's
technology transfers to Beijing as well as investigations in
alleged Chinese campaign contributions.
	   Clinton was joined at the announcement by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, departing later Wednesday for Geneva for a
five-nation meeting, hosted by China, on steps to prevent an
escalation of nuclear tensions in South Asia.
	   ``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests, stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment,'' Clinton
said.
	   He said the United States continues to deal forthrightly with
China on contentious issues such as human rights. ``There have
clearly been some concrete results as a result of this engagement
as well,'' he said.
	   U.S. exports to China have tripled over the last decade and now
support over 170,000 American jobs, Clinton said. ``But just as
important, trade is a force for change in China, exposing China to
our ideas and our ideals and integrating China into the global
economy.''
	   But questions about questionable technology transfers to China
are sure to color the debate.
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and the chairmen of four
Senate committees, saying they were ``deeply troubled by the
national security implications'' of the administration's actions,
released copies of letters to Clinton and Cabinet members seeking
rafts of new documents.
	   The letters requested ``any and all documents'' in the
administration's custody pertaining to the satellite exports and
Chinese proliferation activities, including phone logs, memos,
tapes and electronic mail.
	   Meanwhile, The Washington Times reported Wednesday that a
previously undisclosed improper export by Hughes Aircraft of
satellites containing embargoed technology was a key reason former
Secretary of State Warren Christopher opposed a plan to shift
authority for approving such exports to the Commerce Department.
	   Citing a Sept. 22, 1995, classified memo, the Times said
Christopher, along with the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence
agencies, strongly opposed shifting the export authority from the
State Department to Commerce because Hughes ``recently'' had
exported two satellites with sensitive cryptographic technology
without first getting a State Department munitions license.
	   Clinton overruled Christopher and shifted the authority to
Commerce, then headed by the late Ron Brown, a former head of the
Democratic National Committee.
	   ``This is a very serious matter,'' Lott told reporters late
Tuesday following a closed-door meeting with the committee
chairmen.
	   Lott also suggested the controversy over satellite exports to
China _ and whether they were influenced by political campaign
contributions _ could make it harder for the administration to win
approval this year of renewal of most-favored-nation trade status
for China.
	   Congress has 30 days to accept or reject Clinton's decision. The
battle over trade with China is always fierce, but is expected to
be even more so this year in light of the controversy over the
administration's satellite-export decisions.
	   But Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said, ``I think that
there are some who are making the erroneous connection between MFN
and all the other questions that have now arisen regarding our
relationship with China. I think that's a mistake.''
	   But Lott said the allegations that have surfaced, including
those of campaign contributions to the Democratic Party that
originated with a Chinese military officer, creates alarm.
	   He has already said that the revelations have caused him to
reconsider his past support for extending most-favored-nation
status to China.
	   Furthermore, Lott suggested that Americans are focusing on the
China controversy, particularly because of the recent nuclear
weapons testing by India and Pakistan.
	   Some Republicans have suggested a link, asserting that satellite
exports to China enabled it to help ally Pakistan with its own
program _ thus bringing pressure to bear on India to test its
weapons.

Education Ministry spokesman said some students might not have
received their letters yet via the post.
	   ``If they have not received any letters, it does not mean they
have failed to secure places. They can check with the master list
at their former schools.
	   ``If their names are not on the list, it means they have not
managed to obtain places.''
	   Form Six classes started today.
	   Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said he would
announce the number of places allocated to Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia
holders in Form Six in a few days time.
	   He said this to reporters after opening a seminar organised by
the ministry and the National Association of Private and
Independent Educational Institutions at Universiti Tenaga Nasional
today.
	   Najib said the Government had managed to increase the number of
places for higher education in the country to accommodate the
larger number of students this year.
	   More students are choosing to remain in the country this year
going by the current economic situation. The increase in the number
of students seeking higher education here is also attributed to
better Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia and SPM results.
	   Najib said the increase in places was achieved via franchise
programmes between public universities and private colleges.
	   ``Certain parties and the media have highlighted the alleged
problems concerning the matriculation courses of public
universities franchised to private colleges.
	   ``They have also periodically highlighted the problems
concerning the UPU Infoline.
	   ``They should be aware that franchise programmes and the UPU
Infoline are all introduced to help us cope with the increasing
number of students seeking to pursue higher education in the
country.''
	   Najib said parents should not worry about the quality of
matriculation courses run by private colleges as they have been
vetted by the National Accreditation Board.
	   ``The board will constantly monitor the courses to ensure they
are of the highest quality. I will also be visiting several private
institutions of higher learning soon to monitor the situation.''
	   As for the higher fees for matriculation courses at private
colleges, Najib said Mara would be awarding scholarships to
students.
	   On ``3+0'' programmes, Najib said the ministry had directed the
National Accreditation Board to accord provisional approvals to
private colleges which have applied to run the programmes so that
the institutions can start conducting the courses as soon as
possible.
	   ``If the colleges have to wait for full approvals, it will take
a long time. The board had earlier said that colleges might have to
wait up to six months for full approvals.''
	   Najib said five private colleges had applied to run ``3+0''
programmes and to date none has received provisional approvals.
``We received the fifth application on May 16,'' he said.

In protective gear, U.N. experts search for Iraqi missile warheads

<TEXT>
	   Al-NIBAI, Iraq (AP) _ United Nations weapons inspectors searched
through reeds and sand dunes Wednesday for missing missile parts in
a bid to verify Iraq's claims that it has buried all its biological
and chemical missile warheads.
	   Wearing protective suits, masks, boots and gloves, some 27
experts led by German Jean Jano used metal detectors and other
equipment in their search at Al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
north of Baghdad.
	   Others supervised an earth-moving machine as it uncovered the
nose cone of a missile warhead. ``This belongs to a conventional
warhead,'' shouted an Iraqi engineer.
	   In 1991, Iraq chose to destroy a great number of its long-range
missiles and bury them rather than declare them to U.N inspectors.
	   ``We hope that this work will help to settle some of the still
outstanding issues concerning the missile warheads,'' Jano, 61,
told The Associated Press.
	   Brig. Ismael Saeed Ahmad, the Iraqi official who supervised the
1991 destruction and burial at al-Nibai, said U.N. monitors have so
far recovered enough parts to account for 49 biological and
chemical warheads. He did not say how many were buried.
	   As for conventional warheads, only 10 remain unaccounted for, he
said later in Baghdad.
	   The area where Iraq unilaterally buried its missiles is vast.
Experts with magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors placed small,
red flags on the ground to determine where the next digging should
be.
	   ``We've with us some of the latest state-of-the-art high-tech
equipment,'' said Vincent Murphy, a 69-year-old geophysicist from
Boston. ``It is all digitally recorded. The data is brought back in
the recorder to one of the vehicles and downloaded to the laptop.''
	   The advanced equipment is needed because no aerial photography
or satellite images will penetrate the type of soil at al-Nibai, he
said.
	   Jano, an aerodynamics expert, said inspectors have found ``for
instance, aluminum canisters that are used for chemical agents and
some stainless steel canisters... used for biological agents.''
	   But he refused to say how many missiles and warheads were buried
nor would he divulge whether what they have collected so far is
sufficient to verify Iraqi claims that all its long-range missiles
and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons have been destroyed _
the main condition for the U.N. Security Council to end the
crippling sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   The current excavation is scheduled to end June 18.
	   Jano said another team of experts will arrive in Baghdad soon to
analyze the findings, now stored at Taji, a military camp 20
kilometers (12 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Accounting for special warheads is one of the main hurdles in
Iraq's efforts to declare itself clean of prohibited missiles with
ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Ahmad claimed all such missiles have been accounted for.
	   In addition, U.N. inspectors are believed to have accounted for
817 of the 819 Scud missiles in Iraq's arsenal.
	   The Iraqis at the site refuse to wear safety gear, saying there
is nothing toxic about the pieces of scrap underground. U.N.
monitors' suits are burned every day, and inspectors wash their
hands and feet in a bleach solution before leaving the site.

Gadhafi expected Friday in Egypt, first stop a tent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is set to open
a 10-day visit to Egypt on Friday, making his first stop in a tent
pitched in the Western Desert, Libyan officials said Wednesday.
	   In line with U.N. sanctions on Libya banning international
flights, Gadhafi will come by car, said the officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   After resting in the tent _ in keeping with what Gadhafi calls
his Bedouin identity _ he will spend Friday night at a farm he owns
outside Cairo and then arrive in the Egyptian capital Saturday.
	   It was not clear if he would drive or fly to Cairo. His tent is
to be pitched 23 kilometers (14 miles) outside the northern coastal
town of Marsa Matruh.
	   Gadhafi had been expected to arrive Tuesday, but a postponement
was announced the day before. During his trip, he will meet with
President Hosni Mubarak, economy officials, university students,
workers and intellectuals. It's his second visit in two years.

Bar Council: Better to have judicial management orders, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - The Government should consider introducing
provisions in the law to enable the courts to place a moratorium on
claims against a debtor company to give it a chance to pick itself
up.
	   Bar Council president Dr Cyrus Das said this measure, practised
in Britain and Singapore, was more advantageous than winding up
companies which were still viable.
	   He said judicial management orders were more appropriate in the
current economic situation which had led to the need to keep viable
companies in business.
	   Das was responding to the Malaysian Investors Association's
suggestion that a special bankruptcy court be set up.
	   ``It would be more appropriate to amend the Companies Act to
provide for the making of judicial management orders, in lieu of
liquidation, to rescue companies which are viable except for their
present inability to pay their debts,'' he said in a statement.
	   He said the principal aim of judicial management orders was to
place a moratorium on claims against a debtor company that
qualified for such an order, in order to give it a brief respite to
rehabilitate itself under a scheme. ``It is generally beneficial to
all parties. It benefits the shareholders who would otherwise lose
their investment, the employees who would have the chance of
keeping their jobs, and the unpaid creditors who will have a chance
of being paid.''
	   He also said a judicial management order should only be made in
cases where the court was satisfied that the company could be kept
alive as a going concern, and would be able to implement a scheme
of arrangement to settle its debts.

	   Philippine exports of coconut products in the first five months
increased to 971,002 tons in copra terms compared with 508,750 a
year earlier, preliminary data from an industry group showed.
	   The United Coconut Associations of the Philippines Inc. (UCAP)
also said in a report preliminary data on coconut oil exports from
January to May more than doubled to 569,328 tons from 279,328.
	   UCAP said the export data was based on a survey conducted
between Jan. 1 and May 27.
	   Besides coconut oil, the Philippines exports copra meal,
desiccated coconut, coconut shell charcoal, activated carbon and
oleochemicals.
	   It said coconut oil exports from May 1 to 27 hit 110,500 tons
based on the survey. Actual exports for the whole month of May last
year reached 27,981 tons.
	   Vegetable oil traders attributed the high export volumes to
carryover stocks from last year's harvest.
	   ``We doubt that we can maintain high export volumes for the rest
of the year because of the drought,'' one trader said, adding he
expected coconut oil exports to dip to 90,000 tons this month.
	   ``After June, we will see slower exports,'' he added.
	   The Philippines, the world's largest exporter of coconut oil,
has had below normal rains since April 1997.
	   Scattered rains have fallen in parched coconut farms over the
past two weeks but traders said they do not expect a recovery in
the crop until next year.
	   They said it would take between five and 14 months for coconut
farms to recover from the drought.
	   Philippine Coconut Authority Administrator Virgilio David has
said he expected the country's coconut output in copra terms to
drop by 10% this year from 2.6 million tons in 1997.
	   Asian Exotics Regionals Going Downhill, But slowly Asian
regional currencies continued to sink in early afternoon trading,
with the rupiah leading the way, pulled down by a weak yen.
	   Attention will be focused on Japan's Vice Finance Minister
Eisuke Sakakibara who will attend an international symposium in
Tokyo later today and may say something about the weakening yen.
	   In Indonesia, the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) said the
country's economy was likely to contract 10.1% this year. Inflation
was seen reaching 80%-85%.
	   The Indonesian rupiah edged lower hurt by trade and inflation
figures late on Monday.
	   Inflation in May rose 5.24% on a month-on-month basis, bringing
the year-on-year rate to 52%.
	   The March trade surplus was a huge $1.97 billion, up from $1.70
billion in February.
	   The improvement came via a drop in imports rather than a rise in
exports.
	   Imports fell to $2.37 billion from $3.82 billion in March last
year.
	   Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris said unemployment in Indonesia
would rise this year to 15.4 million or just over 17% of the
workforce.
	   The Philippine peso was off its lows. It's selldown was
exacerbated by declining Treasury bill rates whose benchmark rate
fell to a new 10-month low on Monday.
	   But traders said the peso was well supported as dollar demand
from commercial clients has been minimal in the past few days.
	   In Malaysia, the ringgit was unimpressed by central bank
Negara's stance to maintain interest rates at present levels.
	   It got off its high but stayed soft following profit-taking by
offshore players. Traders said it was possible for the ringgit to
hit 4.00 per dollar in the near-term.
	   The Thai baht extended its decline amid strong dollar demand
from offshore players.
	   Analysts said the delay in floating up to $2 billion of Thai
sovereign bonds has a lot to do with the baht's weakness.
	   But dealers expected the downside to be capped as some long
dollar positions still needed to be unwound.
	   The Korean won eased at the outset along with the weaker yen.
Dealers said the market was already long in dollar but jitters
about the yen fueled the buying of more dollar.
	   The Taiwan dollar was easier after pulling up from a five-month
low. It was bid at 34.355 to the dollar.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Israeli troops manning a watchtower
on Wednesday opened fire on Palestinians approaching a Jewish
settlement and shot one man in the leg.
	   The soldiers opened fire after the Palestinians tried to enter
the settlement, the Israeli army said. In similar cases in the
past, Palestinians tried to place explosive devices near Israeli
army positions, a statement said.
	   A senior Palestinian security official, Col. Khaled Abu Ula,
said the incident outside the Neve Etzion settlement was under
investigation, and that Palestinians have lodged a complaint with
the Israeli army.
	   In the shooting, a 22-year-old man from the nearby town of Rafah
was shot in the right thigh.

	   Frankfurt, the chosen seat of the European Central Bank, was a
disappointment to my wife Nina. The five-hour Eurail ride from
Amsterdam, with the quick train transfer at Cologne, was a
refreshing experience.
	   However, she was totally unprepared for the unbathed idlers who
littered the way out of the Frankfurt train station.
	   The 300-meter walk to our hotel made us increasingly aware of
the incredible number of street hangers-on, obviously unemployed
and restless.
	   A Filipina nun, we later met at the Romerberg Cathedral,
strongly advised us to stay with the crowds for security reasons.
	   The bed sheets of our hotel room looked yellowish and the towels
suspiciously worn out. Cigarette burns were all over the furniture.
There was an almost empty roll of tissue paper in our room's
toilet. When we asked for more, the receptionist harshly said the
chambermaid had knocked off and he had no idea where to get toilet
paper. The hotel did not deserve its three-star international
rating.
	   In the evening, we were awakened by the noise of drunken or
drugged carousers under our window. Nina put her foot down and
insisted we look for another hotel. Our booking agent apparently
did us a disservice, for in the next street we found clean
hospitable lodgings that cost even less. The transfer somewhat
salved some of Nina's initially formed biases.
	   Our stay at Munich was more pleasant, although we still
experienced ill-mannered treatment from hotel personnel. Neither
could we find any English station on TV nor English translation on
most menus. Tourism does not seem to be high on Germany's list.

	   INSTITUT Teknologi Mara intends to start a visiting academy to
bring local and foreign scholars to do their sabbatical teaching at
the institute, says Professor Zulaiha Ismail, dean for the Centre
for Graduate Studies.
	   She adds that ITM's tradition of working with international
faculties will attract foreign and local academicians to contribute
to the academic development in ITM.
	   ``The learning strategies adopted by our students and teaching
excellence of our academic staff have allowed the institute to grow
and be a leading institution of higher learning.
	   ``We believe that both our students and our teachers can benefit
from a global outlook.''
	   Zulaiha says ITM's international link was established more than
four decades ago through its twinning arrangement with Ohio
University in the US for a bachelor's programme in business
administration.
	   ITM also set up the Tun Razak Chair at Ohio.
	   ITM now has nine branches and a student population of about
57,000.
	   It began as an institution providing training to Bumiputeras for
certificate, diploma and advanced diploma courses. However, in
October 1996, ITM was allowed to offer degrees and post-degree
courses.
	   With the upgrading of its programmes, ITM must phase out its
twinning courses and establish its Centre for Graduate Studies.
	   This means ITM can now offer courses at master's and doctorate
levels, besides devoting more time to research.
	   However, this does not mean that ITM is severing its links with
foreign partners as their expertise is still sought for certain
courses.
	   ``With our enhanced status, we are encouraging more of our
academicians to take up research relevant to the country's needs.
We are looking at smart partnerships with industries for support
and direction.''

	   CASUAL wear manufacturer, retailer and distributor Gemzboh
Holdings plans to issue 60 million shares priced at $1 per share in
an initial public offering (IPO) to finance its ambitious expansion
plans.
	   The net proceeds of the IPO, estimated at $31.5 million, will be
used to set up 20 outlets in five mainland provinces. The firm also
plans to expand its product range, including sports apparel, with
the rest used as general working capital, chairman Tsoi Kwing-ming
said.
	   Tai Fook group will sponsor the issue.
	   The 60 million shares to be offered will be made up of 40
million new shares and 20 million existing shares.
	   The issue price represents a prospective price to earnings
multiple of 6.21 times on a pro forma fully diluted basis and 5.85
times on a weighted average basis.
	   The prospective annual dividend yield is 5.25 per cent.
	   Tai Fook Group managing director Peter Wong said the prospective
price to earnings multiple was not too high considering the
mainland retail market was booming and the company had good
business prospects with strong sales.
	   Mr Tsoi said the impact on the company of the Asian financial
crisis had been minimal since the firm's main operations are based
on the mainland and the yuan has remained stable. He said most of
the company's sales were registered on the mainland market.
	   The group forecast that its combined profits after tax but
before extraordinary items for the year ended December 1998 will be
at least $38 million.
	   The company's secured bank loans at the end of 1997 amounted to
$50.46 million of which 80 per cent was sourced from mainland
banks.

Italian police find thousands of dangerous Chinese-made toys 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Chinese-made toys
considered dangerous because they fail to meet European Union
safety standards have been confiscated, police said Wednesday.
	   The approximately 800,000 toys included plastic guns made with
metal rods that could easily pierce an eye and teddy bears whose
fur sheds and could be swallowed by children.
	   Police said they were investigating possible links to the
Chinese underworld. They said the toys carried false EU
certification stickers, enabling them to pass through customs.

	   YAHOO! has announced the launch of Yahoo! Chinese, its Chinese
language Internet guide which is created in both simplified and
traditional Chinese characters.
	   Yahoo! Chinese can be found at http://chinese.yahoo.com
(traditional) and http://gbchinese.yahoo.com (simplified).
	   Bringing together regional and general interest Web sites,
programming and services in Chinese, Yahoo! Chinese addresses the
needs of the community of individuals around the world who read
Chinese.
	   According to the 1997 World Almanac and Book of Facts, Mandarin
Chinese is the most spoken language in the world with 853 million
native speakers and 999 million total speakers around the globe.
	   Rather than focusing solely on a specific geograhic region,
Yahoo! Chinese is Yahoo!'s first world site that addresses the
needs of a large community of individuals who share a common
language and cultural bond around the world.
	   ``Yahoo!'s goal is to continue to bring together Web resources
and services in a context that makes the most sense and brings the
most value to the different segments of our users,'' said vice
president international Heather Killen.
	   She added ``Because people who read Chinese are not limited to
the same geograhic region, we have combined regional Web content
along with general interest content to enable individuals from all
over the world to communicate and share in similiar cultural ties
and interests.''
	   Yahoo! Chinese is the newest addition to Yahoo!'s network of 13
world properties, which currently include UK/Ireland, France,
Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Canada, Australia/New
Zealand, Japan, Asia and Korea.
	   The Yahoo! Chinese directory features Web sites and resources
for broad interests as well as information for specific countries
and regions.
	   Using Yahoo! Chinese, individuals can find local information for
the areas that most interest them as well as general topics of
interest to Chinese speakers anywhere in the world such as arts,
sports, astronomy, culture and Chinese medicine.
	   Individuals can also read the latest news in Chinese from news
providers around the world, including China Internet Corp, a
worldwide business information network based in China that includes
news feeds from leading news providers such as Xinhua News,
Bloomberg, Agence France Presse, Reuter and Nikkei; China Times
Interactive, Taiwan's first online newspaper and part of the China
Times Group; Central News Agency, Taiwan's only nationwide news
agency featuring news feeds from leading providers worldwide.

accidents in the country over the past three decades:
	   Feb. 2, 1990: Two elevated inner-city trains crash in
Ruesselsheim, near Frankfurt, after train driver misses stop

collides with freight train because of signal failure. 46 killed,
25 injured.
	   July 21, 1971: Train ``Swiss Express'' derails rounding curve
near Freiburg. Technical problems blamed. 23 killed, 143 injured.
	   Feb. 9, 1971: Train derails while rounding curve in the Allgaeu,

Gadhafi expected Friday in Egypt, first stop a tent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is set to open
a 10-day visit to Egypt on Friday, making his first stop in a tent
pitched in the Western Desert, Libyan officials said Wednesday.
	   In line with U.N. sanctions on Libya banning international
flights, Gadhafi will come by car, said the officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   After resting in the tent _ in keeping with what Gadhafi calls
his Bedouin identity _ he will spend Friday night at a farm he owns
outside Cairo and then arrive in the Egyptian capital Saturday.
	   It was unclear if he would drive or fly to Cairo. His tent is to
be pitched 23 kilometers (14 miles) outside the northern coastal
town of Marsa Matruh.
	   Gadhafi had been expected to arrive Tuesday, but a postponement
was announced the day before. During his trip, he will meet with
President Hosni Mubarak, economy officials, university students,
workers and intellectuals. It's his second visit in two years.

Butler to lay out ``road map'' for Iraq to follow to end of sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With pressure mounting to speed arms
inspections, the chief U.N. inspector is presenting evidence
Wednesday to the Security Council to try to justify his claim that
Iraq is still hiding illegal weapons.
	   During the closed-door meeting, which began Wednesday morning
and is expected to last most of the day, Richard Butler is also
expected to lay out a ``road map'' of specific steps Baghdad must
take to comply with U.N. disarmament orders and bring an end to
nearly eight years of crippling economic sanctions.
	   U.N. officials said Butler will provide aerial photos and
technical materials to argue that Iraq has failed to account for
all long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological
materials it is believed to have held before the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Destroying those materials is the main condition for the council
to lift sanctions imposed in August 1990 after President Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
	   Officials of the U.N. Special Commission, which perform
inspections, have appeared frequently before the council since
1991. But U.N. officials said Butler is expected to provide far
more technical information and detailed evidence than in previous
presentations because of pressure within the council to bring the
program to an end.
	   Russian, Chinese and French diplomats are expected to question
him intensively and in some instances challenge his conclusions.
Those countries have spearheaded a bid within the council to
accelerate inspections so that sanctions can be lifted.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said he expected the meeting to
produce ``a higher level of technical literacy'' among council
diplomats regarding Iraq's weapons programs.
	   ``These are complex matters and it's important they be
understood,'' Weston said. ``I think it's important that the Iraqis
themselves understand what's needed.''
	   On Tuesday, the council listened to an Iraqi delegation, led by
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argue that it has
complied with U.N. orders and that sanctions should be ended.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as
Saddam remains in power. British and American diplomats said Iraq
provided no new information about its weapons programs.
	   Pressure has increased on Butler's teams since Secretary-General
Kofi Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open
Saddam's palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.
	   U.N. inspectors have not visited any palaces or other sensitive
sites since April 2 for fear that failure to find any weapons
caches will only undermine their argument that Iraq has still not
come clean.

	   MR RAJEN M, a pharmacist, used to consider traditional medicine
as ``hocus- pocus''. That was until he developed a bad rash in late
1988/1989 which just refused to be cured with the help of the best
drugs, creams and dermatologists.
	   Back against the wall, he eventually visited a homeopath and in
two treatments, Rajen was completely cured.
	   ``I tried the best of modern medicine for two years but did not
work, and what I regarded as hocus pocus was successful and at a
cost which is a a fraction of what it would cost with conventional
medicine,'' Rajen admitted.
	   That was probably the catalyst for Rajen to delve deeper into
the realm of traditional herbal medicine. In fact, already in the
1970s, Rajen sensed that there was more to the body and good health
than just medicine and pain killers and injections.
	   ``If you fall sick and go looking for a doctor, you have already
failed as the body has a tremendous and innate capacity to heal
itself,'' said Rajen in an interview with Business Times.
	   ``The very day you get sick means you have defeated this
capacity to take care of itself,'' said Rajen, adding that
``outside help can be radical with the use of invasive methods and
toxic drugs all of which undermine the body's capacity.''
	   This approach to health led Rajen to set up Total Health Concept
Sdn Bhd (THC) - of which he is managing director - in 1995 which is
responsible for bringing in Ayurveda herbal medicine from India in
partnership with the long established Dabur healthcare group.
	   Rajen also conducts seminars on the various aspects of
traditional medicine and prescribes alternative treatment for those
suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and other ailments.
	   Describing the revival in traditional medicine as a global
paradigm shift, Rajen said people are increasingly concerned about
their bodies and also their internal and external environment.
	   However, Rajen does not disregard modern medicine at all: ``I do
not give any advice which is contrary to modern medicine.''
	   He always tells people not only to work with the doctor, but
also to do the life style modifications he prescribes and see
whether the medicine can be reduced or eliminated altogether.
	   ``A lot of advice come from the Ayurveda tradition and Chinese
traditional medicine; a lot of it also comes from a modern
re-examination of traditional medicine, and also my own pharmacist
tradition,'' Rajen said.
	   ``Modern medicine has to look at alternative medicine as a
complementary partner - as opposed to an opposition.''
	   Rajen believes, as stated in the company's mission message, that
``the current revolution taking place in the healthcare field is
the churning between the ancient healing arts and modern
medicine.''
	   The direction of the future will incorporate both ideologies,
notes Rajen.
	   Practitioners of traditional medicine in the fields of
homeopathy, chiropractors, osteopath, Indian Ayurveda and Chinese
medicine and acupuncturist all sit on the company's advisory board.
	   His outlook on life also permeates the way the company is run.
``The business should serve the community and the people rather
than just profit maximisation,'' Rajen said.
	   He is also to introduce a concept whereby staff of the company
can contribute their time to their favourite charity or
non-governmental organisations on company time.
	   As compared to a business that just donates to a good cause,
Rajen wants a business that is focused on serving the community. As
an example of the commitment, Total Health has been sponsoring
TrEES, a Kuala Lumpur-based organisation involved in teaching and
creating awareness in recycling.
	   All the company's product literature are printed on recycled
paper and soon, THC's monthly newsletter will be on recycled paper
too.
	   ``Initially, the biggest obstacle is cost but if enough people
buy it will fund itself - a matter of economies of scale,'' Rajen
said.
	   With a degree from Universiti Sains Malaysia and a Masters in
Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Strathclyde,
Rajen is currently pursuing a doctorate in holistic medicine in the
US through e-mail.
	   In Rajen's words, ``my life is at the moment driven by the
business''. It has obviously reaped results.
	   Subscribers for the company's newsletter on health has reached
10,000 with an overwhelming response to his seminars conducted in
major towns in the peninsula.
	   Juggling his responsibilities to the company and as the
secretary of the Malaysian Pharmaceutical Association, Rajen finds
time to write a weekly column on traditional aspects of medicine
and healing for a local English newspaper.
	   He lives his life according to the philosophy that he preaches -
he is a vegetarian, does meditation daily and exercises regularly.
	   According to Rajen, one important theme that runs through the
literature on alternative medicine is that of personal
responsibility for one's health.
	   As he puts it aptly, ``Health ... is not an absence of disease
but rather an enhanced state of well-being. (It) is something that
people must create for themselves by taking a personal
responsibility for their own lives.''

	   MULTIMEDIA Super Corridor software company Datek Sdn Bhd expects
to invest an additional RM20 million in marketing and business
development programmes within the next three months.
	   Chief executive officer Darryl Carlton said the company had so
far invested RM15 million.
	   ``We will be focusing on the European, American and Chinese
markets,'' he said. He was speaking at the company's unveiling of
Solo 3270, which allows users to access IBM mainframes from their
Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers.
	   Carlton said Solo 3270 was aimed at the millions of personal
computer users around the world who need to access the IBM
mainframes but could not do so.
	   ``The market for Solo 3270 is huge. Altogether there are 450,000
mainframes worldwide and they contain roughly 70 per cent of the
world's data.
	   ``These mainframes are configured to the IBM 3270 computer
protocol and include those produced by computer giants such as
Amdahl, Hitachi, Fujitsu and NEC,'' he added.
	   Solo 3270 is written in pure Java programming language, which
means that it can run on any operating system, regardless if one is
accessing the mainframe through a computer running on Apple, Unix
or Microsoft Windows.
	   Priced at US$29.85 (RM115.22) each, Solo 3270's price is
expected to be a key strategy in enabling Malaysian technology
penetrate the global market.
	   ``Our focus for the Solo 3270 will be in North Asia (China,
Japan, Korea and Taiwan) as we foresee growth markets for the IT
industry there...but we would need to achieve a certain level of
success in the United States first.''
	   Carlton said Datek was now in negotiation with a computer
manufacturer for the inclusion of Solo 3270 as standard software.
	   ``We are talking to a global personal computer manufacturer to
have Solo 3270 included in every machine they manufacture.If
successful, it will be a step forward in getting Solo 3270 to
become a market leader within the next 24 months.''
	   Carlton added that Datek expected to sell 13 to 15 million units
of Solo 3270 a year if the deal came through.
	   On the sales of Batavia which Datek launched in April, he said
there was more interest in the product in Asia.
	   The company had spent RM10 million developing the product and
was noted as the first homegrown MSC status company to launch the
all-new made-in- Malaysia software development tool.
	   Batavia is a tool for developing large-scale applications for
businesses and organisations.

Hingis, Seles at it again in French Open semifinals 
</HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Last year, Martina Hingis showed her youthful
exuberance with a joyful leap after beating Monica Seles in the
French Open semifinals.
	   The two battle again in the semifinals Thursday, with the other
women's semifinal pitting Lindsay Davenport against Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, a pair of 20-somethings occupying spots many fans thought
would be taken by teenagers.
	   The Hingis-Seles match has the appeal of a final.
	   Will Hingis get another chance to jump for joy or will Seles,
playing her first tournament since the death of her father, make it
back to the final of an event she has won three times?
	   It pits the No. 1-ranked and top-seeded Hingis, winner of four
of the last five Grand Slams but no French Opens -- against former
No. 1 Seles, the winner of nine Grand Slams.
	   Hingis has won each of their five previous meetings. Last year's
French Open match was the only time they have not met in a final.
	   ``The last time I played Martina was here,'' Seles said. ``We
had a very tough match.''
	   That 6-7 (2-7), 7-5, 6-4 victory by Hingis lasted more than two
hours. Hingis called it the most satisfying victory of her career
at the time.
	   This year Hingis has rolled through the first five rounds,
losing just 21 games in five matches, including seven to Venus
Williams in the quarterfinals. She is 37-4 this year with four
titles.
	   Seles has played just five tournaments this year, with a 13-4
mark. Her father died of cancer May 14 and Seles has performed
heroically throughout the tournament.
	   She said tennis helps her get over the loss of her father,
Karolj.
	   ``I think about my dad every day,'' Seles said. ``But for me
it's a tennis match, it's a tennis tournament. I'm doing something
that I love to do.''
	   Seles said her game has improved with the help of new coach
Gavin Hopper.
	   ``We worked really hard with Gavin the first week of the
tournament. I think I feel more comfortable now than a week ago,''
she said.
	   The other semifinal is not quite as exciting on paper --
second-seeded Davenport, who turns 22 next Monday, against two-time
champion Sanchez Vicario, 26. Davenport ousted defending champion
Iva Majoli in the quarterfinals.
	   Sanchez Vicario has a 23-6 record for the year, but her only
title came in the first tournament of the season in Sydney. She has
a 6-2 career mark against Davenport, including wins in their only
two matches on clay.
	   Sanchez Vicario knows her experience helps. She won her first
French Open title nine years ago and has 60 victories in the French
Open.
	   ``I've been there so many years already,'' she said. ``I think
the experience of being in situations like this before helps. But I
also have to play well enough to win.''
	   Davenport knows a victory on clay is not expected from her.
	   ``If you look at this year, I haven't been winning tournaments
necessarily on clay,'' Davenport said. ``Gosh, I mean, I've
surprised myself here.''
	   She has a 32-8 record this season, winning just one tournament.
But that was a big one, handing Hingis a loss in the Pan Pacific
final in Tokyo in February. Davenport said she's proud to be a part
of tennis' older generation.
	   ``I'm going to be 22 in five or six days,'' she said. ``I'm
getting old for women's tennis.''

	   THE technical know how of the Malaysian manufacturing sector is
expected to be further enhanced, judging from the overwhelming
response of more than 500 companies from over 30 countries expected
to participate in the Industry Tradefair Malaysia 98 (ITM 98) and
Machine Tool Malaysia 98 (IMX 98) exhibitions.
	   Organised by Malaysian Exhibition Services Sdn Bhd (MES), both
these exhibitions, running from June 3 to 7, are expected to boost
the manufacturing sector and increase productivity, efficiency,
product quality and capability.
	   MES director Brendan Kelly, said although the size of the show
has been reduced by about 30 per cent as compared to the year
before, he was satisfied that ITM 98 has lived up to its billings
as the country's premier manufacturing and machinery exhibition.
	   ``Under the present economic slowdown, to maintain a more than
60 per cent success rate is itself an envious achievement for any
exhibition organiser.
	   ``This clearly reflects the strong confidence of exhibitors in
our ability to attract quality trade visitors to the show to help
in meeting their business objectives,'' he said.
	   In line with the Government's push to encourage a higher volume
of exports and boost productivity as well as efficiency, ITM and
IMX are expected to fulfil the needs of manufacturers to remain
competitive in the international arena.
	   For manufacturers to sustain their operations competitively and
be more productive, Kelly said there is a need to upgrade their
operations by investing in high technology manufacturing techniques
through automation processes so as to become less labour-intensive.
	   This year's event, to be held at the Mines Exhibition Centre in
Sungai Besi, will occupy an exhibition space of more than 8,500 sq
m and has attracted several groups from South Korea, Taiwan, China,
Spain, Indonesia, France and the UK.
	   Among the groups, South Korea will form the largest group to be
represented by 25 companies, followed by Taiwan with 16 companies
and the UK with 12 companies.
	   The wide range of exhibits on display will include latest
machinery and equipment, state-of-the-art production processes and
precision engineering techniques, tools and dies, parts and
components, among many others.
	   Both ITM 98 and Machine Tool Malaysia 98 are endorsed by Sirim
and supported by the Federation of Malaysian Foundry and
Engineering Industries Association and the Selangor and Federal
Territory Mould and Die Association.
	   At the same time, the Printing and Packaging 98 exhibition has
won the endorsement of the Asian Packaging Federation.
	   These events are expected to attract ket decision-makers,
buyers, entrepreneurs and technology experts from the related
industries.
	   Some of the major local companies that have confirmed their
participation at ITM and IMX '98 are SSI Schaefer Systems, Unipac
Engineering, Great Wall Packaging Suppliers, Eastway Engineering
and AE Automation.

	   ALUMINIUM Company of Malaysia Bhd is poised for expansion when
the economy recovers, said chairman Tan Sri Tunku Imran Tuanku
Ja'afar.
	   Speaking after the company's annual meeting last Wednesday, he
said Alcom was flush with cash having over RM9 million in the kitty
and no capital debts. It was also still recording strong sales.
	   ``We have learnt the lessons of the mid-80s when we were in a
very bad financial situation just as the recession kicked in. Now,
our focus is on ensuring the cash-flow position remains strong.''
	   He added that the company conducted most of its sales in cash
terms and as such had no bad debts.
	   Also, all raw material imports and product exports were fully
hedged, resulting in virtually no risk in terms of currency
fluctuations when it came to the impact on the company's
bottomline.
	   Further, the company has shifted much of its sales to the
manufacturing sector to offset reduction in orders from the
construction sector.
	   ``Our exports still remain strong, making up over half of our
total production. But sales in the Asian region has been affected
slightly by the on-going economic problems.''
	   On 1998's expected performance, he said sales had dropped
slightly in the first quarter but was still within expectations.

Former head of Chernobyl assails authorities over nuclear safety 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - In an open letter to the Ukrainian
president, the ousted head of the Chernobyl atomic power plant
accused Ukrainian authorities of violating international nuclear
safety obligations and said their behavior was immoral.
	   Serhiy Parashin said a new Ukrainian company in charge of the
country's five nuclear plants, ``cannot secure their safety.''
	   ``For five months, the company has been working without a
license to operate nuclear reactors,'' said Parashin's letter,
published Wednesday by the daily newspaper Dyen.
	   That violates Ukraine's nuclear energy and radiation safety law
and the Vienna nuclear safety convention, which Ukraine ratified
last year, Parashin argued.
	   Parashin, who opposed the creation of the state-run company,
Energoatom, was dismissed from his job in early May after
Energoatom officials accused him of ``gross violations of work
duties and executive discipline.''
	   Parashin accused President Leonid Kuchma, who faces new
elections next year, of pursuing political goals by forming
Energoatom.
	   ``The desire to maintain, even by violating the law, a company
... with 50,000 employees that produces 45 percent of Ukraine's
electricity, can only be explained by the wish to subordinate the
financial resources of the nuclear power industry to a single goal
_ the president's re-election campaign,'' Parashin wrote.
	   ``If this is true, you have no moral right to rule a country
that has Chernobyl,'' he added.
	   Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4 exploded during an April 1986 test in
what became the world's worst nuclear accident. At least 32 people
died in the disasters's immediate aftermath, and victims' groups
say tens of thousands of others have died from radiation-related
diseases.
	   ``It is immoral to violate the nuclear energy law in Ukraine,
which has suffered dlrs 120 billion in damages from the catastrophe
and has three million affected citizens,'' Parashin said.
	   Parashin worked at Chernobyl as an engineer beginning in 1977
and became plant director in 1994. Energoatom has appointed a top
company official and former chief Chernobyl engineer, Vitaly
Tolstonohov, as his successor.
	   The newspaper noted that similar warnings have been issued by
Olexander Smyshlyayev, Ukraine's top nuclear safety official.

	   THE volume of Hong Kong's re-exports increased by 6.2 per cent
in March over the same month last year, while domestic exports rose
by 1.5 per cent, the Census and Statistics Department said.
	   Taken together, the volume of total exports increased by 5.5 per
cent while the volume of imports rose by 0.3 per cent, the
department added.
	   The volume of Hong Kong's re-exports for the first three months
of 1998 increased by 2.5 per cent against the same period last
year, while the volume of domestic exports decreased by 4.6 per
cent.
	   Taken together, the volume of total exports rose by 1.4 per cent
for the first quarter while imports fell by 1.7 per cent.
	   The growth in volume of trade is derived from the growth in
trade value with the effect of price changes discounted.
	   Comparing March 1998 with March 1997, both the prices of
re-exports and domestic exports fell by 2.8 per cent. Import prices
fell by 4.1 per cent.
	   The statistics department said prices were based on unit values
which do not take into account changes in the composition or
quality of goods traded, except for some selected commodities for
which specific price indices are available.
	   On price changes in the first three months of 1998 against the
same period last year, prices of re-exports and domestic exports
decreased by 2.5 per cent, while import prices decreased by 3.9 per
cent.
	   Compared with the same period last year, the trade index rose by
1.3 per cent in March and 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1998. The index is the ratio of export price index to import price
index.

	   THE Government is to soon upgrade the Malaysian Skills
Certificates (SKM) programme to a degree level in order to attract
more students to join the programme.
	   Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mussaid school-leavers
are more inclined to apply for admission into universities making
it difficult for the Government to gather the best group for skills
training.
	   He added thatskills training is equally vital for national
development as is academic knowledge.
	   The minister was speaking to reporters after presenting
certificates to 97 students of the Yayasan Basmi Kemiskinan (YBK)
Training Centre in Shah Alam yesterday.
	   He said discussions are being held between his ministry, the
Education and Human Resources ministries, the Economic Planning
Unit and the Public Services Department on upgrading the
certificates to a degree level.

	   In celebration of the Centennial year, Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran
will launch Lupang Tinubuan: Mga Kasabihan Tungkol sa Bayan written
by Tsinoy writer Joaquin Sy on June 5, 10 a.m. at the residence of
President-elect Joseph E.Estrada, who will be the guest speaker.
	   Geared toward the masa, Lupang Tinubuan: Mga Kasabihan Tungkol
sa Bayan is a collection of more than 100 sayings and quotations
from all over the world about love of country. Translated into
Tagalog, the sayings echo the sentiments expressed by Andres
Bonifacio, ''Ang pag-ibig sa tinubuang lupa ang siyang
pinakadakilang pag-ibig sa lahat.'' The book is Kaisa's offering to
the Filipino people in the hope that it will contribute to a deeper
and stronger sense of nationalism.
	   Kaisa, a cause-oriented, non-profit non-government organization,
aims to promote the integration of the Tsinoys (Tsinong Pinoy or
Chinese Filipino) into mainstream Philippine society. On one hand,
Kaisa helps bring Tsinoys into meaningful participation in national
concerns. On the other hand, Kaisa aims to enhance the Filipinos'
understanding and awareness of the true role of the ethnic Chinese
in Philippine life.
	   Priced at P50 each, the book will initially be available through
Kaisa and soon at National Bookstore, Bookmark and other outlets
nationwide. For orders, call Kaisa at tel. 242-0808, 242-3123.

	   JOHOR BARU, Mon. - It was a dream come true for two former
neighbours, meeting again on Saturday after 40 years.
	   British national Lyn Medland, 46, who left Malaysia about 40
years ago, and her former neighbour P. Paruvathy shed tears of joy
when they greeted each at the Causeway.
	   ``It is so wonderful ... I never thought this day will come,''
said Medland when met later at Paruvathy's house in Taman Johor
Jaya.
	   ``After several unsuccessful enquiries at the Malaysian and
Singapore High Commissions, the Malaysian Tourism Promotion Board
and British Army office, I had almost given up meeting Paru
again... we are half a world apart,'' she added.
	   Medland and her husband Clive Percival, who are on a cruise trip
to Singapore, stopped over here for a day.
	   Now living in Southampton, Medland was staying in Johor Baru
with her family from 1959 to 1960 when her father was serving with
the British Army's Jungle Warfare School (now Pulada in Kota
Tinggi).
	   Her intention to catch up with Paruvathy was highlighted in the
New Straits Times on April 23.
	   Paruvathy described the meeting as a miracle.
	   ``When I saw her at the Causeway, I was speechless ... We just
gave each other a very tight hug.''
	   Paruvathy used to work for the Medland family. The Medlands
wanted her to follow them when they moved to Seremban and then back
to England.
	   However, Paruvathy was unable to do so as she had to look after
her elderly mother, brothers and sisters. They lost touch with each
other as the Medlands were always on the move.
	   Paruvathy was only told of the article in the NST on May 20. She
sent a letter to Medland immediately after calling up the NST Johor
Baru bureau for her address in England.
	   Concerned that the letter might not reach Medland before she set
off on her cruise, Paruvathy sent a telegram on May 22. Paruvathy
also sought the help of her friends here who have connections in
England to inform Medland of her telephone number.
	   Medland said: ``I received a telephone message from a person who
said she had information about Paru on the morning of May 23. That
same evening, I received Paru's telegram.
	   ``I was so excited that I called Paru immediately to arrange for
a meeting here. Three days later, just shortly before my husband
and I set off, I received Paru's letter.''
	   Paruvathy and Medland literally took a trip down memory lane
when they visited Medland's previous house in Johor Baru, Pulada
and the Kota Tinggi waterfalls.

Kurdish rebels kill nine passengers in attack on minibus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TUNCELI, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels stopped a minibus near
this eastern city Wednesday and killed nine passengers with
automatic gunfire, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The guerrillas, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast,
often target civilians, especially when under pressure from the
Turkish military.
	   Two other passengers were wounded in the attack near the village
of Pertek, the agency said. The rebels fled before troops reached
the scene.
	   The army recently escalated an offensive launched against
guerrillas. On Tuesday, the military claimed killing 589 rebels
this year.
	   In new clashes Wednesday, soldiers killed six Kurdish rebels in
the southeastern province of Siirt, Anatolia said.
	   The war has killed some 37,000 people since 1984.

At least 70 dead in high-speed German train crash 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: UPDATES with details on injuries; minor editing
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany after colliding with an automobile
that had plunged off an overpass. At least 70 people were killed
and 200 injured, state officials said.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train was going 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The wreckage suggested that the automobile crashed through the
overpass guardrails and struck the train as it sped underneath. The
nose of the train cleared the bridge, while the cars behind
derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. At least six survivors were
taken to a public building in Hanover.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991. At least 13 cars derailed, piling into
each other and crashing into the base of the overpass, collapsing
it. The force of the pile-up pushed cars meters (yards) high into
the air.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   About 10 trauma surgeons were at the scene, Christian Krettek,
of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN. He said rescue workers
expected the death toll to rise, and it was still unclear if there
were more dead inside the shattered train cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The German border patrol sent helicopters and 80 personnel to
help emergency workers free passengers trapped inside the rail
cars. Officials feared many inside were dead.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

Hamas says it is ready for dialogue with America 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Palestinian group whose suicide
bombers have killed scores of civilians in Israel says it is
prepared to talk to Washington, but only to ``clarify facts'' and
not to take orders, according to remarks published Wednesday.
	   ``We do not close the door in front of any dialogue with the
United States, if it wants this,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, was quoted as saying by the Al-Hayat
newspaper.
	   He accused the United States of supporting Israel, and warned
that ``we fight our enemy and those who stand by its side.''
	   While there was no chance of talks with Israel, Hamas could
discuss matters with the United States to ``clarify facts and not
to receive orders and dictations,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Hamas is bitterly opposed to the U.S.-sponsored peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians. It advocates the total
destruction of Israel and claimed responsibility for several
suicide bombings that killed scores of civilians in Israel in
1996-97.
	   ``We are talking with Israel by arms and force until it knows
who is strong (and) right. We will continue to talk to it (Israel)
by this method until we liberate all Palestinian territories and
not part of it,'' he said.
	   Al-Hayat, a leading Arabic-language newspaper published in
London, interviewed Yassin in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the
latest stop on his tour of Muslim countries to win support for
Hamas.
	   Yassin, who is 61-years old and quadriplegic, has so far visited
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Yemen and Syria. He is expected to travel to Pakistan and Malaysia.

New England captain hopes to revive England against South Africa 
</HEADLINE>
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Alec Stewart will carry England's
hopes of winning its first test series against a major power since
1985 when he leads the home side in the first of five tests against
South Africa starting Thursday at Edgbaston.
	   For Stewart, who replaces Mike Atherton as England captain, a
series win against the Proteas is vital.
	   England's last win over a power was in 1985 when David Gower led
the side to a 3-1 series victory over Australia.
	   It is South Africa's first five-test series in England since its
return from isolation in 1991-92. In England in 1994, it shared a
three-test series 1-1 draw and then beat England at home 1-0 in a
five-match series in 1995-96.
	   Stewart, 35, the oldest member of England's 12-man squad for the
first test, is mindful of his side's predicament.
	   He said the two sides are evenly matched, suggesting the home
team might have the advantage.
	   On paper, England has more strengths than South Africa, but the
visitors' classier new ball attack could easily swing a test in its
advantage.
	   ``We have a lot of respect for (Allan) Donald and (Shaun)
Pollock, and the South Africans are a well disciplined side to play
against,'' Stewart said Wednesday.
	   ``I am someone who respects the opposition but I am more
concerned about how we play,'' he added.
	   South African pace bowler Donald and his ever-improving
understudy, Pollock, are no strangers to Edgbaston.
	   Donald and Pollock played county cricket for Worcestershire and
know the ins and outs of the seamer-friendly Edgbaston pitch.
	   The pitch traditionally favors a seam bowling attack but Stewart
said a spinner could be advantageous on a pitch that looked ``flat
and soft underneath''.
	   England's sole spinner, off-spinner Robert Croft, looks likely
to win a test berth while three players, Mark Ealham, Dominic Cork
and fast bowler Dean Headly, fight for the remaining two positions.
	   ``It looks a good batting pitch,'' Stewart said. But, given the
amount of rain lately, he intimated he would be tempted to bowl
first.
	   South Africa, fresh from a 2-0 win over Sri Lanka, is not
expected to make more than two changes.
	   Captain Hanse Cronje said tour selectors had already met and had
settled on a combination.
	   A final decision will made after the tourists have had a good
look at the wicket. If conditions warrant it, the South Africans
may revert to their old ploy of an all-seam attack.
	   However, if the skipper has his way, then the unorthodox wrist
spinner Paul Adams will play.
	   ``I just don't think one can go into a five-day test without a
spinner,'' Cronje said.
	   The only obvious change to the side that beat Sri Lanka at
Centurian Park in March is expected to be the return of
middle-order batsman and brilliant fielder Jonty Rhodes.
	   Rhodes, who scored a century from 74 balls in an earlier tour
game, will bat No. 6. He will be making his first test appearance
since January, having missed the five tests against Pakistan and
Sri Lanka.
	   England: Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec
Stewart (captain), Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, Mark Ealham or
Dean Headley, Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Darren Gough and Angus
Fraser.
	   South Africa (from): Gary Kirsten, Karl Liebenberg, Jacques
Kallis, Darryl Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes,
Shaun Pollock, Mark Boucher, Paul Adams, Allan Donald, Makhaya
Ntini, Brian McMillan, Pat Symcox, Steve Elworthy and Adam Bacher.
	   Umpires: David Shepherd (England) and Russel Tiffin (Zimbabwe).
TV umpire: John Hampshire.
	   Match referee: Javed Burke (Pakistan).

	   JAKARTA (JP): The number of foreign tourists visiting Bali, the
country's top tourist destination, fell 7.3 percent in the first
four months of this year to 356,114 from 384,033 in the same period
last year.
	   The head of the provincial tourist office I Nyoman Sugiri said
in Denpasar yesterday that the fall was attributed to growing
tension in the country's political atmosphere.
	   Nyoman was quoted by Antara as saying that recent tourist
arrivals from the United States and Canada, Europe and neighboring
countries was badly affected by the massive riots, looting and
arson which rocked the country last month.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Former Staff Officer (Administration) of
the Federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman, Assistant
Commissioner Koh Hong Sun today assumed the post of Brickfields
police chief.
	   He succeeds Senior Assistant Commissioner II John Chong who has
been transferred to the Sabah Brigade of the General Operations
Force in Kota Kinabalu to assume the post of the commandant.
	   The handing-over of duty was witnessed by City police chief
Datuk Kamaruddin Md Ali at the Brickfields police headquarters.
	   Earlier, Chong presented commendation certificates to 38
policemen and two civilian employees.
	   Malacca-born Koh, 46, has been in the force since 1971. During
his 27 years of service, he has held a number of posts, including
as the head of the Interpol office here.

co-operation from residents to help curb criminal activities in
their area.
	   ``Police will continue to maintain good relations with resident
associations,'' he said.

Turkey denies helping Pakistan prepare nuclear testing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey did not help Pakistan prepare for
its nuclear tests and did not supply parts for the tested weapons,
the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday, denying Greek press reports.
	   On Sunday, the Greek weekly newspaper To Vima said that Turkey
and Pakistan have been cooperating on nuclear research for military
purposes over the past 25 years.
	   The research cooperation helped Pakistan develop the capacity to
conduct last week's nuclear tests, the report said, adding that
Turkey purchased rocket components from China and Western countries
and then shipped them to Pakistan.
	   ``All these allegations are totally unfounded,'' Turkey's
Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``Turkey has no intention to
produce nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.''

Opposition leader released from jail 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The leader of a youth opposition group was
released from prison after two months Wednesday, but officials said
his case was still open.
	   Pavel Severinets, 21, was arrested April 2 after taking part in
a rally sanctioned by the authorities. Severinets heads the Young
Front, the youth branch of the nationalist Popular Front.
	   The rally in the Belarusian capital Minsk marked the first
anniversary of a union agreement between Belarus and Russia. The
agreement calls for closer ties between the two former Soviet
republics, but fell short of Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko's goal of reintegration.
	   The Popular Front has denounced the union treaty as a virtual
surrender of Belarus' post-Soviet independence. The authoritarian
Lukashenko has responded to their protests with a crackdown on his
political foes and free media, but he remains hugely popular in the
country of 10 million people.
	   Belarusian authorities marked the treaty's anniversary with folk
concerts. Severinets and his supporters later went to the
microphones and began singing nationalist songs. Police did not
intervene, but later arrested Severinets on charges of
``hooliganism and violation of public order.''
	   Severinets has been in a Minsk jail ever since.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors asked the his imprisonment be extended
for another month while his case was investigated. But on
Wednesday, he was suddenly freed on condition he stays in Vitebsk,
his home town in eastern Belarus.
	   Officials refused to comment on his release.
	   Severinets' lawyer, Garri Pogonyailo, who has defended other
opposition activists, was stripped of his license Tuesday on a
technicality. Pogonyailo said the decision was revenge for his
action.

	   IMPROVING enforcement of intellectual property rights is a key
element in speeding the economic recovery in Asia, the Director of
Intellectual Property, Stephen Selby, said yesterday.
	   Speaking on the second day of the World Intellectual Property
Organisation (WIPO) Asian Regional Symposium, Mr Selby pointed out
that intellectual property-related investments in Asia amounted to
billions of dollars.
	   ``The present economic difficulties in Asia have forced us all
to take a long, hard look at how best to exploit our economic
resources. More and more economies in Asia now recognise creative
talent, inventiveness, and even folklore as a national resource,
and are looking to boost their protection of intellectual property
as a way to maximise their economic potential,'' Mr Selby said.
	   He said the symposium was a timely opportunity to exchange
ideas.
	   It is aimed at exploring the technical aspects of implementing
the Agreement on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (Trips).
	   Trips is one of the subsidiary agreements of the agreement
establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
	   Trips also expands the scope and protection of intellectual
property rights to trade-related issues.
	   ``Effective enforcement is the key to complying with the Trips
agreement,' Mr Selby said.
	   ``Hong Kong has been in de facto compliance since 1996, although
compliance is not mandatory until 1 January 2000,'' he added.
	   Hong Kong remains on the United States' watch list of countries
breaching intellectual property rights.
	   Despite the series of enforcement actions of the Customs and
Excise Department, the US decided to retain Hong Kong on its watch
list.
	   Government officials have denounced the US action as they
pointed to the progress that Hong Kong has achieved.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A doctor is looking for his Indonesian
Indian maid who went missing in Subang Jaya last night.
	   P. Loganathan and his family were at a pasar malam when the
maid, known only as Anjileh, 38, parted company with them about
7.30pm to buy her things. They agreed to meet at the BP Pharmacy at
8.30pm but Anjileh never turned up.
	   Loganathan proceeded to search through the crowds before driving
through the neighbourhood looking for her. He then went home,
hoping she would find her way back.
	   He lodged a police report this morning but had yet to receive
any news.
	   He is worried as she does not have her travel documents with
her.
	   Loganathan is not sure whether Anjileh is lost or if she has run
away.
	   He urges anyone who has any information about the maid to
contact him at 03-7374520.

Floor price of unhusked rice to be increased to Rp 1,000, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): The government has decided to increase the floor
price of unhusked rice this month by 43 percent to Rp 1,000 (10 U.S
cents) a kilogram from Rp 700, Minister of Agriculture Soleh
Solahuddin said yesterday.
	   ``The increase will be formally announced Wednesday,'' he said,
adding that the decision was taken in an economic, finance and
industrial ministers coordinating meeting here yesterday.
	   Soleh said the increase, the third in the last five months, was
expected to increase farmers' incomes and to further encourage
farmers to boost rice production.
	   ``The main objective of the rice price increase is to improve
the real incomes of the farmers amid the soaring prices of
essential needs and farming materials, including pesticides,'' he
said.
	   The government announced a 17 percent increase in the producer
floor price of unhusked rice to Rp 700 from Rp 600 in April in a
bid to increase farmers' incomes.
	   The government also raised the price of unhusked rice procured
by Bulog from village cooperatives 16.2 percent to Rp 716 per
kilogram from Rp 616 per kilogram.
	   The price of unhusked rice procured by the State Logistics
Agency (Bulog) from parties other than village cooperatives was
increased 16.4 percent to Rp 710 per kilogram from Rp 610 per
kilogram.
	   The price of polished rice procured by Bulog from village
cooperatives increased 15.8 percent to Rp 1,125 per kilogram from
Rp 971 per kilogram and from other sources 16 percent to Rp 1,115
per kilogram from Rp 961 per kilogram.
	   But many analysts said that the price increase failed to boost
farmers' incomes because the move was followed by a rise in
fertilizer prices.
	   Soleh said the subsidy for kalium chloride fertilizer (KCl),
which has been abolished, would be reintroduced again to help boost
rice production.
	   Reduction of KCl use in rice farming has resulted in a downward
trend in the country's volume of production, Soleh said,
attributing this to farmers no longer being able to afford the
fertilizer.
	   ``We are still discussing the amount of the subsidy,'' he said,
adding that farmers needed 65kg to 70 kg of KCl fertilizer per
hectare for rice farming.
	   Soleh said that to further help farmers, the government had
ordered state fertilizer producer PT Pupuk Sriwijaya (Pusri) to
distribute fertilizers from its plants to retailers and
cooperatives.
	   ``The move was taken to minimize the distribution line and to
reduce the soaring prices of fertilizers,'' he said.

	   SOUTHERN Bank Bhd says the continuing regional economic turmoil
will negatively impact its prospects for the financial year, with
business volumes seen to moderate in line with a slower growth.
	   The level of non-performing loans is expected to rise and
monitoring asset quality remains a key challenge, says chairman Tan
Sri Osman Cassim in his annual statement.
	   However, the amalgamation of Southern Finance Co Bhd with the
bank is under way.
	   When completed, it is expected to add value and strengthen the
core businesses of the bank, he adds.
	   The group posted a pre-tax profit of RM122.20 million for the
year ended December 31 1997, down 29.7 per cent from RM173.73
million in the previous corresponding period in 1996.
	   Results were adversely affected by lower contribution from its
brokerage and futures subsidiaries, the group said.
	   Group profit after tax and minority interest was RM83.43 million
in 1997 and RM108.18 million in 1996, while basic earnings per
share was 26 sen against 33.8 sen previously.
	   The board has recommended a first and final gross dividend of 10
per cent amounting to RM23.02 million.
	   Meanwhile, total group loans and advances rose 20.6 per cent to
RM5.4 billion while total deposits grew by 19.3 per cent to RM6.7
billion.
	   At the bank level, pre-tax profit was RM120 million, marginally
lower from RM121.6 million in 1996.

No long-term effects from haze, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Medical authorities do not expect any
long-term health effects from haze as its presence is sporadic in
nature, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today.
	   Compared to air pollution in the form of smog in many
industrialised countries, the constituents of haze in Malaysia were
different, he said.
	   He was speaking to reporters after opening the World Health
Organisation Bi-regional Workshop on Health Impacts of Haze-related
Air Pollution here.
	   Smog, a combination of mist and smoke emissions from factories
in industrialised countries, occurred daily and therefore was more
hazardous than haze, said Chua.
	   According to British media reports, an estimated 20,000 to
25,000 people died annually due to the effects of smog, he said.
	   Chua said studies conducted by his ministry's Centre for Disease
Control last year showed that although there was an increase in
conjunctivitis, asthma and upper respiratory tract infections
during the 1994 and 1997 haze periods, the the increase was not
``statistically significant.''
	   The Institute for Medical Research also carried out a similar
study and its findings were similar to that of the CDC, Chua said.
	   He said Director-General of Health Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman
would chair a meeting on Thursday to finalise the report on the
CDC's findings.
	   He added that the recent haze episode had shown the need for
countries in the region to co-ordinate research on the impact of
such air pollutants on health.
	   He said the health impact in individual communities as a result
of air pollution due to extensive forest fires was not fully known
or understood.
	   The Environmental Health Research Centre in Malaysia, developed
with the help of WHO, would become the regional focal point for
environmental health research, he said.
	   Chua said the EHRC, established in September 1996 at the
Institute for Medical Research, would co-ordinate all such research
and set up an environmental health information system.
	   Participants attending the workshop were from member countries
of the Southeast Asian Regional Office (Indonesia and Thailand) and
the Western Pacific Regional Office (Malaysia, Brunei, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines and Singapore).
	   Chua said the haze that enveloped Malaysia and the region from
late July to October 1997 was mainly due to forest fires in
Kalimantan and Sumatra in Indonesia.
	   Internal sources of air pollution such as vehicular emissions,
industrial activities and open burning also contributed to the
haze, he said.
	   ``Here in Malaysia, the the haze is made up of particulate
matter commonly known as PM10 and definitely less deleterious than
smog.
	   ``Larger particles will be deposited close to their source while
particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in diameter can be
inhaled,'' he said.
	   Chua said a study by Alam Sekitar Malaysia Sdn Bhd during the
haze showed levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and
carbon monoxide were well within WHO air quality standards.

Three Spanish players in final four 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts and UPDATES with Corretja quotes.
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alex Corretja became the third Spanish player to
reach the French Open semifinals Wednesday, defeating Filip Dewulf
of Belgium 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.
	   It will be the first Grand Slam semifinal for Corretja. He joins
his good friends Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla in the final four.
All excel on the clay courts of Roland Garros.
	   Corretja will face either the hometown hero here, Cedric
Pioline, or Hicham Arazi of Morocco.
	   ``This is history,'' Corretja said. ``I think it's really good,
because normally it's not easy to have a country put three guys in
the semis of a Grand Slam. We used to see the American guys in
other tournaments, but not the Spanish guys.''
	   Deuwlf hadn't lost a set until Wednesday's straight-set loss to
Corretja. The 39th-ranked Belgian has good luck at Roland Garros;
last year he reached the semifinals.
	   On Tuesday, the consensus favorite on the men's side, No. 3 seed
Marcelo Rios, went the way of the other top seeds here. He was
upset in four sets by Moya, losing his chance to regain the No. 1
ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   The Chilean held that spot for a month earlier this year, and
could have reclaimed it with a quarterfinal victory.
	   But at least one predictable phenomenon remains on course: the
onward march of Martina Hingis, the world's undisputed best woman
player.
	   Hingis defeated Venus Williams on Tuesday with such ease that it
put to rest any talk of a great rivalry _ at least for now.
	   Hingis next faces a newly inspired Monica Seles, a three-time
champion here, in one of Thursday's semifinals. No. 2 seed Lindsay
Davenport plays two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
other.
	   With Davenport and Seles advancing, there are two American women
in the French Open semifinals for the first time since Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert reached the final four in 1987.
	   But there were none of the hoped-for echoes of Evert and
Navratilova when Hingis and Williams took the court for their much
anticipated match.
	   In a swirling wind that hampered both players, Hingis used her
deft touch and uncanny court sense to dictate play throughout.
	   Never in the 6-3, 6-4 victory did the Swiss star appear out of
control, off balance or rushed.
	   Williams, for her part, hurt herself with 38 unforced errors.
	   ``I don't think I was as patient as I should have been. I guess
everyone knows I like to hit,'' Williams said. ``I suppose I got a
little too excited, really wanted to hit a winner.''
	   Hingis came into the match with a 5-2 career record against the
eighth-seeded Williams, but the two 17-year-olds were 2-2 this
year.
	   The match promised to be an intriguing battle between power and
smarts. Despite her far greater experience, Hingis actually is 3{
months younger than Williams.
	   But, just as in their only previous Grand Slam tournament
encounter _ a 6-0, 6-4 win by Hingis in the U.S. Open final last
summer _ the match turned into a one-sided affair.
	   ``It's probably good for me to lose so I can really see what I'm
doing wrong and really look at myself and say, `Venus, you're not
there,''' she said.
	   Moya, seeded 12th here, is ranked 12th in the world, but has
been as high as fifth. He's hoping to crack back into the top 10
this week.
	   He became the talk of the tennis world at last year's Australian
Open _ for both his dashing good looks and his talent. He upset
defending champion Boris Becker in the first round, then went
straight through to the final, where he lost to Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old Moya had never
gone past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And here at
Roland Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two
previous visits.
	   Now Moya is the highest seed left in the tournament. On Friday
he faces his good friend Mantilla.
	   ``We're going to be friends until Friday,'' he said. ``When we
get to the court, I will try to kill him.''
	   Tuesday's action ended on a sour note when Gustavo Kuerten, the
defending champion who lost in the second round, was disqualified
in doubles for throwing his racket at the chair umpire and hitting
a fan in the stands, but apparently not causing injury.
	   ``I'm so sorry for what happened and I regret what I did,'' the
Brazilian said Wednesday in a statement. ``I know that this will
make me a more mature guy and will make me grow. I want to make it
clear that I never had the intention of hurting anyone on or off
the court.''

	   THE resale of uncompleted flats in some new housing estates in
Tsing Yi and Tsuen Wan has not improved despite the government's
decision to suspend various anti-speculation measures, property
consultants said yesterday.
	   Centaline Property Agency sales supervisor for Tsing Yi branch
Fred Chau Wing-fai revealed there had been no resale transaction
for Tierra Verde in Tsing Yi in the past past two days.
	   It was reported that 20 resale transactions in the estate were
recorded on Saturday when its developer Cheung Kong sold 1,148
flats by 4 pm, less than a day after the government announcement
seven measures to perk up the economy.
	   The measures included the temporary suspension of some
anti-speculation measures in the property sector.
	   Mr Chau said warm market sentiment following last Saturday's
announcement was the major reason for the resale transactions that
day.
	   ``It is easy to find support as the second-hand (uncompleted)
flats are offered at prices of 2-4 per cent or $50,000 to $100,000
higher than the first-hand purchase,'' Mr Chau said.
	   He said people became more calm afterwards and they understood
there would be good supply of flats in the near future.
	   With the present economy, he also expected no speculation
because government measures could stabilise the market.
	   On the other hand, he said there were no resale transactions for
Mount Haven, another new estate in Tsing Yi, this week.
	   ``There were about 30 to 40 resale offers for the estate with
$100,000 to $300,000 rise of prices compared to first-hand
purchase,'' said Mr Chau.
	   There was concern in the past whether some buyers might cancel
their sales contracts because they could not obtain adequate bank
mortgages after sharp falls in property prices, he said.
	   ``Most sellers should be able to buy their flats, even for those
who purchased at the high price of $4,280 per square feet,'' said
Mr Chau. The resale of uncompleted flats for Phase 3 of Discovery
Park in Tsuen Wan, was also slow.
	   ``Our branch has received about 50 additional resale requests
from the time of the government announcement of the seven-point
measures to the present,'' said Chi Cheung property manager for
Discovery Park branch Man Yeung Shing-wai.
	   But his branch did not record any transaction. ``Sellers are
inactive (in dropping their prices) since they purchased their
flats at much higher prices, compared to phase one and phase two
developments'', said Mr Yeung.

BI returns benchmark rates ceiling to Jibor, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Bank Indonesia (BI) reverted to the Jakarta
Interbank Offered Rates (Jibor) yesterday as the basis for
determining the ceiling of bank deposit rates.
	   BI Governor Sjahril Sabirin said the decision was made to ensure
a ``flexible monetary policy''.
	   Under the ruling, effective yesterday, the interest rate ceiling
for rupiah deposit is set at 500 basis points above the preceding
weekly average Jibor. The rate for foreign exchange deposits is
fixed at 100 basis points above the Jibor benchmark.
	   Saving deposits offered with rates above the ceiling will not be
guaranteed by the government under the new ruling.
	   The government in January promised to guarantee all banks'
obligations to allay fears of jittery depositors following the
closing of 16 banks in November and the dire state of many of the
country's banks.
	   Previously, the maximum rupiah rate was 125 percent of Bank
Indonesia promissory notes (SBI).
	   ``Using the SBI rates as a benchmark was pretty rigid,'' he told
reporters yesterday following a meeting with several economic
ministers.
	   The central bank will announce the benchmark rates for rupiah
and foreign exchange deposit savings every Friday afternoon, which
will be valid for the following week.
	   In the event the Friday falls on a public holiday, the bank will
announce rates on the previous working day. BI has the right to
make the announcement on any other days.
	   The central bank has also set a ceiling on interbank overnight
rates, which will be based on the weighted average of the overnight
rates offered by the banks contributing to Jibor.
	   Although the banks are allowed to freely set the overnight
rates, BI will only guarantee principal payments and interest rates
at the ceiling.
	   Some banking analysts said BI's move on the benchmark for
deposit rates might be an effort to provide banks with operating
profit to increase their loan loss reserves amid the increasing
amount of nonperforming loans.
	   Based on the SBI benchmark, many banks had to subsidize their
third party funds as they had to pay higher interest rates for the
deposits compared to the SBI rates.
	   In the economic crisis, most banks are choosing to put their
money in SBIs as lending activities have been virtually halted and
the interbank money market is considered risky in terms of
safeguarding the banks' own liquidity to pay their dues.
	   The new ruling would effectively lower the deposit rates because
the Jibor rates have been unrealistically lower than the SBI rates,
an analyst said.
	   He said last week's Jibor rates were between 45 percent and 50
percent, compared to the one-month SBI rate at 58 percent.
	   The new interest rates policy will lead depositors to turn to
SBIs, which offer better rates, or to state banks which are deemed
less risky.
	   ``This will send more banks into IBRA (Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency),'' he said, adding that this would accelerate
the restructuring process of the banking sector.
	   Some analysts worry the new ruling might cause further capital
flight as domestic time deposits would become less attractive
compared to the looming hyper-inflation environment and amid
nervousness in the banking sector following the run on the
country's largest private bank, Bank Central Asia, for more than
two weeks.
	   BI director Miranda Gultom was quoted by the state news agency
Antara as saying that the government would accelerate the ownership
restructurization of BCA to prevent a continuing run on the bank
and to improve overall confidence in the banking sector.
	   She said no bank could withstand a sustained run, and that the
only way to assist BCA was to restructure the ownership.
	   BCA is currently controlled by the family of former president
Soeharto and his long-time business associate Sudono Salim.
	   Businesses linked to the former first family have been thrown
into the spotlight recently over allegations of uncurbed cronyism
in the past and unsavory business activities.

	   JAYA Jusco Stores Bhd is confident of achieving a growth in its
group turnover for the current financial year despite the current
economic conditions. For the financial year ended February 28 1998,
the group chalked up a 14.8 per cent increase in its turnover to
RM692.49 from RM603.27 million previously. However, chairman Datuk
Abdullah Mohd Yusof says in his annual statement that in terms of
higher profits for the current year, it would depend on
``operational cost and contribution from newer stores''. For the
year under review, the group's pre-tax profit fell to RM6.06
million from RM44.34 million the last time mainly due to the
provision for unrealised foreign exchange losses amounting to
RM48.4 million in respect of its US dollar denominated loans.
After-tax loss for the year stood at RM14.44 million from a profit
of RM27.76 million previously, while loss per share for the year
was at 24.7 sen compared with an earnings per share of 53.7 sen.
Directors have recommended a second and final dividend of 9 per
cent less tax. An interim dividend of 6 per cent was paid in July
last year.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie appointed three senior
economists as advisors yesterday and revamped the Economic and
Monetary Resilience Council in a bid to accelerate revival of the
country's ailing economy, a minister said yesterday.
	   Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung said former president
Soeharto's two economic advisors Widjojo Nitisastro and Ali
Wardhana along with former minister of finance Frans Seda would
assist the president with all problems affecting the country's
economy.
	   ``The measure is designed to turn the president's intention and
determination to take proactive policies to resolve the country's
(economic) problems into something more concrete,'' Akbar said
yesterday.
	   The three economists were key Soeharto advisors when the former
president came to power in 1967. Soeharto retained Widjojo and Ali
as advisors until he stepped down last March. Both are widely
respected by the international business community.
	   Frans became a businessman after leaving the cabinet early in
the 1970s.
	   Widjojo played a key role during negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial
institutions earlier this year.
	   According to Akbar, Habibie appointed Widjojo chairman of the
resilience council, while State Minister of National Development
Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency
(Bappenas) Boediono was appointed secretary general. He replaces
Salim Group executive Anthony Salim, who recently resigned from the
position.
	   Widjojo was previously Soeharto's deputy on the council.
	   Chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (Kadin) Aburizal
Bakrie and head of Indonesia's corporate offshore debt team Radius
Prawiro have also been given positions on the council.
	   The announcement of Boediono's appointment contradicts a claim
made on Friday by Aburizal that he had been appointed secretary
general but had not yet received official confirmation.
	   The council was established to help monitor the implementation
of a 50-point reform plan agreed between Soeharto and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for a US$43 billion
rescue package.
	   Soeharto appointed Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance
and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita as executive chairman of the
council shortly before Habibie replaced him as the country's leader
on May 21.

	   INTEGRATED circuits trader PCL Enterprises Holdings plans to
deploy more resources to develop its market on the mainland, which
has become a major production base for electronic consumer
production markets worldwide.
	   PCL will focus on building up its sales and distribution network
as well as its product design capability.
	   Executive director and general manager Anthony Cheung said the
group would develop the sales and distribution channels first with
a view to building a solid foundation for its business development
unit.
	   The establishment of the distribution network will be followed
by mainland design centres.
	   Mr Cheung said the group was not seeking joint ventures or
co-operation opportunities on the mainland at present, but it had
not ruled out such tie-ups in the future.
	   Chairman John Seto, however, said that in Taiwan and Hong Kong
the group was considering joint ventures with several foreign
companies mainly on production processing.
	   ``We are still in discussions, but we hope to finalise plans in
a few months,'' Mr Seto said.
	   He admitted that following the outbreak of the financial turmoil
the electronic consumer products industry had seen fierce
competition and there had been strong pressure on prices.
	   He revealed turnover for the first quarter remained at the same
level as the corresponding period last year.
	   The occupancy rates at the company's Chai Wan property
investment reached 100 per cent, said Mr Cheung.
	   He said tenants had requested downward adjustments on rental
charges upon the renewal of their leases.
	   The group is likely to offer a 10 to 20 per cent decrease in
rental charges.
	   ``But there will be only a handful of renewals by the end of the
year,'' he said.
	   The group will focus on improving its production process
technology with the aim of expanding its foundry services business
and value-added products, Mr Seto said.

	   JAKARTA (JP); Publicly listed Bank Niaga is expecting a net loss
in the first quarter this year against a net profit of Rp 31.81
billion (about US$3.18 million) over the corresponding period last
year, its president said yesterday.
	   Gunarni Suworo said the predicted downturn was due to the
increase in the loan loss provision to Rp 39.8 billion.
	   ``Our income will become negative due to the increase in loan
loss provision for possible bad debts,'' she said after a
shareholders meeting .
	   Gunarni declined to mention the amount of the loss.
	   The bank, which recorded a 54.51 percent decline in net profits
to Rp 44.57 billion last year, had also increased its loan loss
provision to Rp 207.1 billion in 1997 from Rp 64.9 billion the
previous year, she added.
	   ``The increase of loan loss also caused our net profit to
decline sharply in 1997.''
	   She warned that the country's economic predicament, which is
expected to worsen in the coming months, would cause most companies
to face problems in repayment of loans to the banking system.
	   The inevitable result would be the likelihood of mounting bad
debts.
	   She said Bank Niaga expected bad debts to increase from between
15 percent to 30 percent this year, similar to the average growth
rate of bad credits in the national banking industry.
	   The bank's problem loans, which include doubtful and bad
credits) reached 5 percent, she said, adding that bad credit alone
was 0.9 percent.
	   ``Due to this, there will be no more expansion plans this
year.''
	   The bank, which allocated total credits of Rp 9.09 trillion by
the end of 1997, is also seeking foreign investors to boost its
capital.
	   ``But it is still in the preliminary stage and hopefully it will
be finalized by the end of this year.''
	   She declined to identify the foreign institutions involved
because ``it is too early''.
	   Gunarni said the bank had obtained approval from its
shareholders to raise its capital to Rp 1.4 trillion from the
current Rp 750 billion as part of its move to meet the new capital
requirement set by the central bank.
	   Bank Indonesia raised the minimum capital requirement for
commercial banks to Rp 1 trillion by year-end, Rp 2 trillion in
2000 and Rp 3 trillion in 2003as part of the measures to revitalize
the country's financial sector.
	   Gunarni also denied rumors the bank was experiencing liquidity
problems and was poorly managed after Hashim Djojohadikusumo's
Tirtamas Group failed to make a full payment on its planned
acquirement of the Tahija's family's 40 percent shares.
	   In July last year, Tirtamas' financial holding company Tunamas
Panduarta bought a 10 percent stake in Bank Niaga through a public
tender offer.
	   It also entered into an agreement with Tahija's wholly owned
Austindo Teguhjaya and Austindo Nusantara Jaya to buy the latter's
75.63 million shares, or 40 percent of the bank's capital, at Rp
8,000 per share.
	   ``I do not know about this transaction, but it is based on a
'willing buyer and willing seller' transaction,'' she said.
	   According to the bank's 1997 financial report, Austindo
Teguhjaya retains a 10.49 percent stake in the bank and Tunamas has
39.51 percent.
	   Other shareholders are RHB Bena Sdn. Bhd. with 20 percent,
life-insurer AJB Bumiputera 1912 with 5.42 percent and the public
with 24.57 percent.

	   CALL it the mother of all pills for what men swear as the mother
of all ills. Viagra has arrived, and indications are that it will
soon be introduced in Malaysia. Will things finally look up for
Malaysia's impotent males?
	   In the face of intense public pressure, worldwide media frenzy
and reported deaths, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng has
announced that Malaysia would need at least 18 months of tests
before sale of the drug would be allowed here.
	   Known also by its generic name Sildenafil citrate, Viagra works
by increasing the blood flow to the penis necessary for maintaining
an erection.
	   It is being touted as the breakthrough treatment of erectile
dysfunction (ED), which is the inability to achieve a satisfying
erection or to maintain it for the duration it is needed.
	   According to Malaysian Urological Association secretary Dr Peter
Ng, the intense hype surrounding Viagra is because there is now,
for the first time, an oral drug for the treatment of ED, the first
that fulfils the strictest standards of testing. In short, it
works.
	   ``For a long time, the treatment of ED was limited in scope to
either painful surgery or administration of oral drugs that weren't
very effective,'' said Dr Ng.
	   Viagra, according to him, is revolutionary because it contains a
chemical that helps restore penile blood flow and erections in
response to sexual stimulation.
	   First developed as a pill for heart problems, Viagra failed
miserably but for one strange but serendipitous observation: all
the male test subjects reported having extremely good erections.
From then on, things were on the rise for Viagra.
	   The first clinical trials subsequently took place, and after
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, Viagra was
approved for sale in America. The drug was soon after tested in
Malaysia.
	   Dr Ng, who was part of the team of urologists who administered
the local trials, is optimistic about Viagra's efficacy. ``For the
first time we have an oral drug that has been proven in the true
scientific technique of testing, a method known as the
`placebo-controlled randomised trials (PCRT)'.''
	   PCRT involves the testing of a drug on two equally random groups
of test subjects, with neither the doctor nor subject knowing
whether the drug prescribed is the real thing or a placebo, both of
which are administered in equal amounts.
	   ``After the trials, the results were statistically analysed to
determine the reponses between the group that was administered the
placebo and the one given the real drug,'' said Dr Ng.
	   The trials were administered at the Subang Jaya Medical Centre
and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak late last year. ``Despite the fact
that any drug tested will have a 30 per cent placebo effect, we
found that Viagra worked so much better than the placebo. We could
now therefore prove that the drug works,'' he added.
	   However, Dr Ng warned of the need for strict controls on the
administration of Viagra. ``As it is, you can purchase Viagra on
the black market or through the Internet. The public must realise
that, like all designed drugs, Viagra has side effects.''
	   These include a possibly lethal cocktail resulting when Viagra
is taken with other medication. Dr Ng also stressed that some cases
of ED are linked to other illness, such as heart problems,
diabetes, or high blood pressure. There is thus a need to treat
these underlying causes first.
	   There is also the dangerous tendency to overdose on Viagra, fed
by the misconception that Viagra is an aphrodisiac. ``Some want to
take it just for kicks,'' said Dr Ng.
	   Ideally, he added, Viagra, if approved for sale locally, should
only be administered by a urologist - a medical expert in the
evaluation and treatment of ED.
	   ``However, I realise that this would be virtually impossible in
Malaysia,'' Dr Ng added, ``because not only would it be
ill-received by the rest of the medical community, but also because
there aren't that many urologists in Malaysia.''
	   The solution? A ``happy middle ground'', which Dr Ng describes
as the sale of Viagra only to physicians who have undergone a basic
workshop on the management of ED.
	   There are also other treatments for ED. They include injections
(currently the most common), intra urethral injections (where a
cream is injected into the urethra), and as a last resort,
prosthetic surgery.
	   As such, Viagra, although considered to be at the forefront, may
not be suitable for some patients. ``Viagra is not the be all and
end all in the treatment of ED,'' he said.
	   It is important that ED patients first seek the advice of a
urologist, who will evaluate and determine the best treatment for
the patient.
	   Currently, Viagra is undergoing a possibly lengthy approval
process from the Ministry of Health, so it would be advisable for
potential customers to hold their horses just a little while
longer.
	   Before the drug is released on the local market, it must have
the approval of the Drug Control Authority and the Ethics
Committee.
	   Sources reveal that the Health Ministry will make an
announcement within the next few weeks.
	   It was once said that manners maketh the man. Now there's a
pill.
	   But, with all the wild enthusiasm for the wonders of Viagra,
perhaps there would soon be a call to create that inevitable pill
to end all pills: one that would facilitate celibacy, perhaps?

	   THE credit crunch and economic conditions in Asia may continue
to worsen before any recovery emerges, Hong Kong Monetary Authority
chief executive Joseph Yam says.
	   Speaking during the Eleventh Dragon Boat Dinner in London, Mr
Yam said there might be further economic casualties in Hong Kong,
necessitating modifications to government policies in specific
areas such as securities regulation and housing.
	   With other Asian currencies having depreciated sharply, he
indicated Hong Kong's competitive position had inevitably been
affected.
	   ``Indeed, economic growth in Hong Kong has been slowing down
rather sharply since the middle of last year,'' he said.
	   ``For the first time, since 1985, we recorded a negative growth
rate in the first quarter this year.'' Mr Yam described the current
tough situation which has meant home mortgage payers and other
borrowers paying interest rates for their Hong Kong dollar loans of
about 200 basis points, an Asian premium that was remaining
uncomfortably high.
	   Also, many Hong Kong residents faced losing their jobs.
	   He said the painful, but evitable, economic adjustment would
continue and understandably there was discontent. But he stressed
the monetary and banking systems were holding up extremely well.

Britain gets new deal to speed Channel Tunnel trains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Wednesday it is back on track
with a new deal to build a high-speed rail link between London and
the Channel Tunnel _ although the plans still will leave Britain
lagging years behind France and Belgium.
	   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said he has signed a new
agreement with London and Continental Railways, the original
contractor whose plans came up short of cash last winter, and
Railtrack PLC, which operates Britain's railroad tracks and
signaling equipment and was brought into the high-speed link
project to save the deal.
	   The slow train tracks in Britain have been an embarrassment ever
since the undersea ``Chunnel'' has been open.
	   France completed its high-speed train tracks between Paris and
the Channel Tunnel five years ago, and Belgium completed its
high-speed link to Brussels last year. The fast tracks allow
Eurostar passenger trains to hit top speeds of 186 miles per hour
(300 kph).
	   When the trains are in Britain, however, they move much more
slowly.
	   The construction of the high-speed rail link is bogging down,
too.
	   Officials had earlier hoped to bring Britain up to speed with
its neighbors across the channel by 2003, but the new plans call
for the rail link to be finished about four years later.
	   The original plans were shattered when London and Continental
Railways said in January that a government grant of 1.8 billion
pounds (dlrs 2.9 billion) was not sufficient and that it would need
another 1.2 billion pounds (dlrs 2 billion).
	   The government negotiated extensively and said under the new
plan it will add just another 140 million pounds (dlrs 228 million)
to the original grant.
	   Prescott said Railtrack would agree to pay for any cost
overruns, telling lawmakers: ``This is an agreement snatched from
the ashes of LCR's collapse.''
	   Railtrack said it would disclose details of the deal later.

	   PROMET Bhd is taking aggressive steps to consolidate in tackling
competition and the economic downturn, chairman Tan Sri Mohamed
Ngah Said says in his annual statement. The company will continue
to focus on its core business of infrastructure development
contracting, civil construction and engineering and steel
fabrication, he adds. ``The recent financial market and currency
weakness in the region and the deferment of infrastructure and mega
projects will invariably reduce available projects drastically. The
impact is already felt and in the short term it has a dampening
effect on our business sentiment,'' he says. Promet posted a
pre-tax loss of RM169.69 million for the 16 months ended April 30
1997. The company's turnover and loss after tax and minority
interest was at RM250.98 million and RM175 million, respectively.
Loss per share stood at 31.60 sen for the year just ended.

	   IPOH, Mon. - The ``1 Sen Fun'' campaign is gaining momentum here
with the latest contribution coming from Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai
Galah.
	   The pupils from the primary school began their collection last
month and within a short period collected about 500 coins.
	   Four pupils accompanied by their former headmaster, Mustafa Ngah
Mansor, and teachers Meor Hashim Meor Hamzah and Azhar Mohamed
Johari took the 20- kilometre drive from their school to the New
Straits Times office here to hand over their contribution.
	   School prefect Azizul Hamik Yusup, 12, said although he and his
fellow schoolmates might not be able to witness the Commonwealth
Games, this did not stop them from supporting it by giving others
an opportunity to witness the historical event.
	   The campaign was launched by Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri
Muhyiddin Yasin on Nov 13, last year.
	   It was aimed at putting back one sen coins into circulation and
also sponsoring schoolchildren, senior citizens and former
athletes, the disabled, orphans and voluntary workers to see the
Commonwealth Games.
	   It was initiated by the NST and TV3 with the co-operation of the
Association of Banks Malaysia and Association of Finance Companies
Malaysia and supported by Bank Negara and the Youth and Sports
Ministry.

	   Farmer and food processors, traders and manufacturer will
discuss with agricultural technicians and government officials ways
to improve the Mindanao food industry's global competitiveness at
the Mindanao Food Congress on July 23-24 in Davao City.
	   Organized by the Mindanao Business Council (MBC) and the
Philippine Food Processors and Exporters Organization Inc.
(Philfoodex), the congress' theme is ''Synchronizing Strategies for
Food Security.'' The event will encourage participants to work
together to solve common problems. Among the discussions are: ways
and means of achieving product quality standardization; assessing
the adequacy of post-harvest technology such as storage and product
treatment; and solving the challenge of the location of local food
processing plants. Participant will also look for cost-efficient
channels of distribution of Mindanao 's potential market for foods.
	   ''This gathering of Mindanao's food producers and processors is
largely aimed at helping out the oversupply of produce to the local
level by projecting forward to exportation,'' says MBC Chair
Sebastian Angliongto.
	   ''In doing so, we should make our products globally competitive
and conform to industry standards,'' he added. Other issues and
concerns the congress will explore include: hazard analysis of
critical points for food and food safety, relevance of science and
technology to product standards, packaging, and market linkage --
both domestic and foreign.
	   Mindanao's typhoon-free weather, fertile soil, and availability
of vast tracts of land make it ideal for agricultural production.
Yet the lack of post harvest facilities such as food preservation,
packaging, and storage creates severe problems for Mindanao
farmers, particularly because almost all of Mindanao's agricultural
products are highly perishable. This often results in unfairly low
prices for Mindanao farm goods.
	   These problems, the Congress organizers believe, could be
significantly reduced if producers switch to technologies that will
achieve international standard and thus allow food procedures entry
to the growing export market.
	   The event is jointly sponsored by the USAID-funded Growth with
Equity in Mindanao Program, the Department of Science and
Technology, Department of Agriculture, Southern Philippines
Development Authority, and the Department of Trade and Industry.

	   SALES volume at Wong's International Holdings dropped 10 per
cent in the first quarter of this year because of the regional
economic crisis.
	   ``The Asian crisis had some adverse impact on the company's
business in the first few months, but we are concerned that its
effect will be bigger,'' chairman Johnny Wong said yesterday.
	   The company's businesses in Southeast Asia this year would not
perform as well as last year, but the total volume in the region
accounts for a small percentage of total turnover, he said.
	   The company's businesses are concentrated in North American,
European and Japanese markets.
	   He also said the site currently occupied by the company in Kwun
Tong would be let.
	   ``Under the present conditions in the property market, we won't
redevelop it,'' he said.
	   Its new printed circuit board factory in Tseung Kwan O
Industrial Estate will be fully operational next month.
	   The company's property redevelopment project in Mid-Levels with
Henderson Land Development may be offered for sale later this year,
Mr Wong said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A former plantation worker who was
sentenced to a total of 36 years' jail on two charges of causing
the deaths of his grandparents and an aunt about four years ago,
lost his appeal today.
	   Court of Appeal judge Datuk Shaik Daud Ismail, sitting with
Datuk Siti Norma Yaacob and Denis Wong, in dismissing Shaharin
Selamat's appeal, said there was no reason for the court to change
the sentences imposed by the Ipoh High Court on Oct 2, 1995.
	   Shaharin, 24, of Parit Tujuh, Sungai Sumun in Rungkup, had
pleaded guilty to three reduced charges of causing the death of
grandparents Jaafar Abdul Jalal, 79, Hamisah Mohd Sharif, 65, and
his aunt, Rohani Jaafar, 52, a teacher.
	   He was charged with committing the offences at the victims'
house in Kampung Batu Tujuh, Jalan Tanjung Tualang, Batu Gajah,
between 1pm and 2pm on Dec 27, 1993.
	   High Court judge Kang Hwee Gee had sentenced Shaharin to 18
years' jail on each charge of causing the death of his
grandparents, the sentences to run concurrently from the date of
his arrest on Dec 30, 1993.
	   On the third charge, he was sentenced to another 18 years' jail
which he was ordered to serve consecutively.
	   Shaharin, represented by Naran Singh, had appealed against the
consecutive sentence, saying it should run concurrently so that he
would only have to serve 18 years' jail.
	   Shaik Daud said although 36 years was a long time, it was not
too long compared to the offences committed. ``If the Deputy Public
Prosecutor, Kamaruzaman Abdul Jalil, had appealed to enhance the
sentencing, this court might probably enhance it.''
	   The facts of the case stated that Shaharin went to the couple's
house at 10am on Dec 27, 1993, to borrow RM100 from Jaafar to
repair his motorcycle.
	   He became angry when his grandfather refused to lend him the
money.
	   While the couple were napping, he hit them with a brick and
suffocated them with a pillow.
	   Shaharin took RM100 from a purse and also Hamisah's jewellery.
	   On his way out, he met Rohani, who had just returned from school
and followed her to her room where he hit her with the same brick
while she was performing her prayers. He then strangled her with a
piece of cloth after which he took her jewellery, RM50 and an
automated teller card before fleeing.

	   KILLINGHALL (Malaysia) Bhd says that it will be able to weather
the current financial turmoil although increased borrowing cost is
expected to reduce the group's earnings. For the year, earnings
growth at Southern Bank Bhd will be restrained by a lower rate of
growth in the economy and this will have an impact on the group's
earnings, says chairman Tan Sri Osman Cassim in the group's latest
annual statement. SBB is an associated company of the group.
Killinghall posted a group pre-tax profit of RM25.07 million for
the year ended December 31 1997, down from RM41.13 million for the
previous corresponding period in 1996. Profit after tax was RM15.47
million in 1997, down from RM27.03 million previously. The group's
earnings per share was 10.9 sen for the period under review as
compared to 17.2 sen in 1996. Directors have recommended a final
dividend of one per cent less tax.

	   Fidel Ramos is going out of his way, much too much, to make it
appear that he is dead serious about serving as Erap's adviser. He
meets with Erap as often as he finds the opportunity in the guise
of sharing information vital to the President-elect's job. FVR will
even ride with Erap to and from Barasoain for the oath-taking.
	   But is there really need for FVR to make such a show of
developing extraordinary relationship with Erap? It may seem to
score points for FVR who seems trying very hard to play the
statesman. But too much kindness too soon, considering the
extraordinary dirty tricks Lakas unleashed on Erap during the
campaign, makes FVR look too much the Greek bearing gifts.
	   Irreparable Depreciation To be sure, Erap knows that FVR is not
leaving him a guiltless legacy.
	   Thus, along the way toward fulfilling his campaign commitments,
Erap is bound to unravel questionable acts and decisions of his
predecessor's administration that will require reparation in a
manner unflattering, possibly even damaging to FVR. Should that
happen, and it likely will, FVR's value as senior adviser will be
irreparably depreciated.

	   THE Government has blacklisted a local artiste and a religious
preacher between last year and April this year, Information
Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Datuk Mohd Shafie Apdal said
yesterday.
	   The singer is a member of a local pop group while the preacher
is from Indonesia.
	   The artiste was blacklisted following existing broadcasting
guidelines, he said.
	   ``It involved a court action against him for dadah abuse,
indecent behaviour and breaking of the laws.
	   ``As for the preacher, the action was based on the advice of the
Islamic Development Department Malaysia.
	   ``The prohibition to air their performances or activities
applies to all broadcasting stations nationwide,'' he said in a
reply to Senator Datuk Abdul Aziz Rahman.
	   Mohd Shafie added that the Ministry had 14 information officers
abroad.
	   ``The cost involved in paying for their living expenditure last
year was RM1.1 million''.
	   He said the task of information officers in countries where
there were no such representatives was handled by the Malaysian
embassies.

	   AN associate firm of Hopewell Holdings,
Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Zhuhai Superhighway Co, is promoting business by
offering reductions of up to 20 per cent on the tolls Hong Kong
lorries are charged.
	   Hopewell Holdings said the special promotion, running from 26
May to 31 December, offered a 15 per cent discount to Hong Kong
Class 3, 5.5 tonne lorries, and a 20 per cent discount to Hong Kong
Class 5, 40-foot container lorries.
	   The group said the special offer was designed to assist Hong
Kong lorry operators during a period of sluggish cross-border
freight traffic, encourage the use of the Huanggang Toll Barrier,
increase the average trip distance travelled by Hong Kong lorries
and raise the number of Hong Kong lorries in the road's traffic
mix.
	   Historically, Hong Kong lorries make up 3.5 per cent of the
highway's daily users and provide 8 per cent of toll income.
	   The joint venture company said the special promotion would have
no negative impact on toll income.
	   To be eligible for the discounts, owners must be members of
designated Hong Kong trucking associations, pay in advance for
pre-sale tickets issued by the company, and use Huanggang as the
highway entry or exit point.
	   The total number of vehicles using the highway per day is
74,000. About 80 million vehicles have used the highway since it
opened in 1994.
	   Apart from toll roads and highways, Hopewell Holdings is also
involved in the development of power plants on the mainland and in
the Philippines. Its elevated road and rail project in Bangkok was
scrapped by the Thai government because of delays.

	   THE Pacific Bank Group recorded a 67.8 per cent higher pre-tax
profit of RM27 million for the first quarter ended March 31 1998.
	   In a statement, the bank said the higher profit was attributed
mainly to the significant reduction in losses experienced by its
insurance subsidiary.
	   It said the bank and all of its subsidiaries remained profitable
and the balance sheet of the group, capital adequacy and liquidity
positions were sound.
	   At the bank level, despite higher interest as well as fee-based
income, pre-tax profit fell 20 per cent to RM26.7 million compared
with RM33.4 million in the preceding quarter.
	   This was due mainly to higher general and specific loan loss
provisions, it said.
	   Loan provisions increased from RM35.8 million to RM44.2 million
and general provision from 1.7 per cent to 1.81 per cent.
	   The higher general provisions, which were non-tax deductible led
to the bank incurring a much higher effective tax rate which in
turn contributed to the lower profit after tax, the bank said.
	   Profit after tax fell 48.4 per cent to RM11.4 million.
	   The bank said the sharper rise in specific provisions was also
attributed to its more stringent policy of providing 100 per cent
of the unsecured portion of sub-standard loans. The minimum
regulatory requirement is 20 per cent.
	   The bank's net non-performing loan ratio (NPL), calculated net
of specific provisions and interest-in-suspense and based on its
own more stringent provision policy, increased from 2.49 per cent
as at end-1997 to 4.91 per cent as at end-March 1998.
	   In addition, it said the bank's gross loans rose by 0.6 per cent
to RM7.14 billion while total deposits fell by 8.5 per cent to
RM7.95 billion.
	   The bank's loan deposits ratio rose from 82 per cent as at end
of 1997 to 89.8 per cent as at end of March 1998.
	   The group's risk weighted capital adequacy ratio declined from
11.9 per cent as at end-1997 to 11.7 per cent as at end-March 1998,
still well above the minimum requirement of 8 per cent.
	   The group's earnings per share rose to 3.39 sen compared with
1.33 sen in the previous quarter.

	   A TOTAL of 3,897 fires were recorded in the country between
January and March this year, Deputy Housing and Local Government
Minister Datuk Azmi Khalid said.
	   The loss of property as a result of fires was estimated at RM92
million, he added.
	   ``The swift action of the personnel from the Fire and Rescue
Department saved properties worth RM732 million from being
destroyed,'' he said in a reply to Senator Datin Wan Intan Ahmad
Tajuddin.
	   To a supplementary question by Senator Hanipah Ahmad on what
action would be taken against arsonists, Azmi said: ``The people
should inform the authorities immediately if they come across such
people.
	   ``It is not right to set fire as a means to express one's anger
as the effect of the wrongdoing is too big for the community to
bear.''
	   To another supplementary question by Senator Abu Bakar Ismail,
who wanted to know if the Ministry had any mechanism to identify
high risk fire areas, he added: ``All State Governments must find
ways to control development taking place at industrial areas.
	   ``Factories that use inflammable chemical and high-rise
buildings will have to submit their building plans for approval by
the Fire and Rescue Department.
	   ``This will enable the planning of a proper fire prevention
strategy.''

	   THE Anti-Corruption Agency has initiated three investigations
into the alleged involvement of their staff in corruption
activities between 1994 and last year, Deputy Minister in the Prime
Minister's Department Datuk Muhamad Abdullah said.
	   One of the cases was recorded in 1995 and the other two last
year.
	   In the first case, the offender was charged in court and
sentenced.
	   ``Of the two cases last year, one is still under investigation,
while in the other, disciplinary action has been taken against the
officer concerned,'' he said in reply to Senator Toh Puan Wan Asiah
Ahmad.
	   To a supplementary question by Senator Long Jidin who wanted to
know how many corruption cases were under probe by the ACA since
the implementation of the ACA Act last March, Muhamad said: ``We
have received 2,898 complaints of which 151 cases are under
investigation. So far, 100 offenders have been arrested.''
	   To another supplementary question by Rosli Mat Hassan on the
Government's stand over the publication of the names of alleged
corruption offenders, Muhamad added: ``By right, this should not
have been done.
	   ``But often enough, such cases become a public matter where not
only the media but the people at large take a serious interest.''
	   In another development, Deputy Home Minister Datuk Mohd Tajol
Rosli Mohd Ghazali said between 1996 and this year, 12 police
personnel had been arrested for harbouring illegal immigrants.
	   ``The action against them includes imprisonment, sacking from
the force or being detained under the Internal Securitiy Act,'' he
said in a reply to Senator Tan Swee Hueng.

	   PRIVATE unit trust manager Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Bhd (KL
Mutual) has declared a gross dividend of 6 sen per unit for its KL
Balanced Fund (KLBF) for the financial year ended May 31 1998.
	   The objective of KLBF is to realise a balanced portfolio which
ensures steady income and capital growth over the medium-to-long
term, says KL Mutual chief executive officer Edmond Cheah in a
statement.
	   KLBF has been ranked first for best performing balanced fund in
its six- month category by Micropal Asia. Micropal has also ranked
eight other funds managed by KL Mutual among the top 10 under their
respective categories.
	   He said KL Mutual is also confident that it can maintain its
market share of the unit trust industry, which stands at 36 per
cent, for the current year.
	   ``We are confident of maintaining our market share and position
as the largest private unit trust manager in Malaysia,'' he said,
adding that the group aims to provide consistent long-term above
average performance for their funds.
	   KL Mutual has attracted RM250 million worth of investments under
the Employees Provident Fund members investment scheme.
	   In addition, KL Mutual plans to provide value-added service to
their clients via financial planning.
	   ``Our target is to provide comprehensive financial planning
services by year 2000,'' he said.
	   To achieve the target, KL Mutual has trained its agents to
provide financial planning services to its fundholders.
	   Selected agents will be sent to pursue the American Chartered
Financial Consultant course, which was made available here
recently.
	   Commenting on the current financial crisis, Cheah said the stock
market would have discounted most of the existing bad news, both
regionally and domestically, and it has been reflected in the
current depressed stock prices.
	   ``This will be a good time for us to selectively look for good
buys,'' he said.
	   However, he cautioned that the market recovery process is
expected to remain volatile.
	   ``This is because as more bad news, such as corporate failures
and poor earnings are anticipated, investors' confidence will be
hurt and this will certainly test the resilience of the stock
market,'' he said.
	   Cheah said KL Mutual will remain conservative and bargain hunt
selectively when the opportunity arises.

Britain gets new deal to speed Channel Tunnel trains

EDs: SUBS 5th graf to show top Eurostar speeds in Britain, picking

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Wednesday it is back on track
with a new deal to build a high-speed rail link between London and
the Channel Tunnel _ although the plans still will leave Britain
lagging years behind France and Belgium.
	   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said he has signed a new
agreement with London and Continental Railways, the original
contractor whose plans came up short of cash last winter, and
Railtrack PLC, which operates Britain's railroad tracks and
signaling equipment and was brought into the high-speed link
project to save the deal.
	   The slow train tracks in Britain have been an embarrassment ever
since the undersea ``Chunnel'' has been open.
	   France completed its high-speed train tracks between Paris and
the Channel Tunnel five years ago, and Belgium completed its
high-speed link to Brussels last year. The fast tracks allow
Eurostar passenger trains to hit top speeds of 186 miles per hour
(300 kph).
	   When the trains are in Britain, however, they move much more
slowly, hitting top speeds of just 100 mph (160 kph).

	   A HIGH level of transparency among public-listed companies in
their trade operations will help safeguard the interest of small
investors, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Wong See Wah told the
Dewan Negara yesterday.
	   He said companies in the same industry and sector should also be
encouraged to merge as this would further strengthen their
financial position.
	   Until May 1, he said, two public listed companies had been
placed under receivership.
	   ``Company directors should practise responsible corporate
governance.
	   ``The Securities Commission will from time to time study and
check the policies of the companies' listing, restructuring
activities, and capital requirements.
	   ``The emphasis will be on the export-oriented sector which will
boost our foreign exchange inflow,'' he said in a reply to Senator
Datuk Eng Hoi Choo.
	   To a supplementary question by Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman on
the failure of public listed companies to furnish information on
their current financial standings to the SC, Wong said: ``A high
level financial committee on corporate management has been
established, led by the secretary-general of the treasury Datuk Dr
Aris Othman.
	   ``It will submit a report to Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim before June 21 on the best corporate practices and training
programmes for board of directors of companies and their
shareholders.
	   ``Other areas that it will look into include the rules and
regulations on company reformation and good corporate management''.
	   To another supplementary question by Senator Rosli Mat, Wong
said many quarters had misconstrued the financial difficulties
faced by companies of national interest.
	   ``Lack of capital, cash flow problem or inability to sell their
products, do not make the companies unviable.
	   ``Companies like Malaysia Airlines and Perwaja should be
supported because their potential speak for themselves,'' he added.

other of cross-border attacks.
	   Eritrea charged Ethiopia with using tanks and heavy artillery in
an attack early Wednesday on the frontier village of Ambesete
Geleba, 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Ethiopia of
provoking ``a new and dangerous escalation'' of the border crisis,
and said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on
Eritrean positions.
	   Hours later, Ethiopian accused Eritrean troops of attacking near
Aiga and Alitena, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) on the Ethiopian
side of a natural border formed by the Mereb River.
	   ``Eritrea thought it could get away with shifting the blame to
Ethiopia,'' the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Both countries have consistently denied invading the other's
territory.
	   No details were available on any casualties in either attack.
	   However, Ethiopia's state-run radio accused Eritrea of publicly
executing three Ethiopian civilians it said were abducted by
Eritrean troops during an earlier cross-border raid.
	   Another 30 civilians were in the custody of the Eritrean army
and their fate was unknown, said Kiros Bitow, a local official. He
said about 24,700 Ethiopians had been displaced in the Badme and
Sheraro areas following Eritrean invasions.
	   Ethiopia first made public the border dispute between the two
Horn of Africa neighbors on May 13, calling on Eritrea to withdraw
from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of illegally occupying a
415-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) area known as the Yirga
triangle in northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half-dozen smaller areas
along the border. But the underlying causes of the conflict are
economic, diplomats and businessmen say.
	   Relations between the one-time allies in a long war against the
former Marxist government of Ethiopia soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November, triggering a trade war
that has hurt both economies and reduced cross-border commerce to a
trickle.
	   Eritrea on Wednesday repeated a call for a total
demilitarization of border areas and outside mediation to solve the
dispute. Ethiopia said it was cooperating with peace negotiators.
	   For the past two weeks, U.S. diplomats and regional leaders have
shuttled between the two countries in a desperate effort to restore
peace that has showed no signs of success.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.

U.S. pledges help to resolve Nagorno-Karabakh conflict 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The United States will support
international efforts to resolve the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh
peacefully, American officials said Wednesday.
	   Ambassador Stephen Sestanovich and other U.S. officials
discussed the conflict Wednesday with Armenian President Robert
Kocharian and his officials in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
	   Sestanovich told reporters that the United States is ready to
work with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous enclave populated by Armenians
but located inside neighboring Azerbaijan. The two former Soviet
republics have long fought for control over the area. Despite a
1994 truce, there have been occasional skirmishes.
	   ``We have been trying to promote direct negotiations between
Karabakh and Azerbaijan,'' said Sestanovich, adviser to the U.S.
secretary of state for the former Soviet republics. ``This is
exactly the goal that the Minsk group (of the OSCE) had in its
proposals last year.''
	   Sestanovich and Ambassador Richard Morningstar, adviser to
President Bill Clinton on the former Soviet republics, also
stressed the U.S. commitment to continue helping Armenian economic
reforms.
	   As part of their whirlwind tour across the former Soviet
republics, Sestanovich and Morningstar also visited Georgia on
Tuesday and will visit Azerbaijan and the Central Asian country of
Turkmenistan.

<TEXT>
	   MALAYSIA Shipyard and Engineering (MSE) Sdn Bhd, a world class
industrial corporation in the maritime industry, is planning to
carve a better competitive edge for itself using its two best
assets - shipyard and workforce.
	   ``I have no plans for any big diversification efforts for the
company. I am value-adding to the company's business and giving
greater depth to our expertise,'' its chief executive officer,
Encik Abdul Rahim Abdul Rahman, told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   MSE's core business expertise lies in three areas -
shipbuilding, shiprepair and engineering.
	   ``We have shipbuilding, shiprepair and engineering expertise in
one shipyard. If we are going to compete with other shipyards in
each of those areas, it will be on a traditional or conventional
basis such as cutting costs and the like,'' he said.
	   ``Therefore we should seek areas where we have what others do
not, and seek businesses which are in need of our expertise. That
way we become a better choice. This is the direction we are
steering the business towards,'' he said.
	   Elaborating further, Abdul Rahim said the company had already
identified one area of business which they are keen on developing.
	   ``It is related to conversion projects, such as the conversion
of ships into larger ones, or the conversion of ships to handle oil
and gas projects like the FPSO (floating, production, storage and
off loading) facility.
	   Another example was the company's engineering projects. ``We are
not just looking at the typical off-shore oil and gas projects, but
are also actively looking at doing projects on-shore,'' he said.
	   ``Currently we are developing our expertise in process equipment
and have actually supplied local as well as overseas petrochemical
plant projects with the equipment.''
	   On his aspirations for the company, Abdul Rahim said he would
like to see the company make the same headway in the shipbuilding
and engineering sectors as has been made in the shiprepair sector.
	   ``I would like to see the same headway made in the international
market for the other two sectors,'' he said, adding that
shipbuilding has made some progress in this respect, having
exported 11 or 12 ships, namely tankers and purseiner containers,
or large tuna fishing vessels to the UK, Iran and Indonesia.
	   Sixty vessels have been lifted and repaired using the largest
shiplift system in the region since its commissioning in the middle
of last year.
	   Over 2,000 vessels have been repaired at the shipyard in Johor,
ranging from naval to commercial ships and barges to Ultra Large
Crude Carriers (ULCC supertankers). Its worldwide clients come from
the US, Europe and the Far East.
	   The company celebrated its 25 years of operations on May 18 this
year.
	   It has 1,700 employees.

Khatami plans to visit New York, address United Nations 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought a
more moderate course for Iran since his election a year ago, plans
to go to the United States to address the U.N. General Assembly in
September, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Referring to the planned address as a ``very important speech,''
the official said Khatami would discuss the position of Muslims in
the world and in the United Nations.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Khatami would urge the United Nations to give Islamic nations a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
	   The statement was the first announcement of the planned trip,
though such a visit had been rumored for days. The trip would
require U.S. government permission.
	   Breaking through nearly 20 years of hostility, Khatami called
for a dialogue with Americans and more cultural and educational
exchanges in a broadcast interview last January.
	   Two previous Iranian presidents have addressed the United
Nations since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but both used their
speeches to attack the United States. Khatami could instead make a
gesture to American leaders.
	   Khatami will also use his trip to meet the 2 million strong
Iranian community in the United States, the official said. Many
Iranians fled their country to settle in the United States and
other Western countries after the revolution.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.

Blair sends condolence message; British troops ordered to scene 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Wednesday sent
sympathy to the German government following the train derailment
that killed at least 70 people in northern Germany.
	   ``I have sent a message of condolence to the people and
government of Germany about the appalling rail tragedy earlier
today,'' Blair told the House of Commons.
	   Opposition leader William Hague said his Conservative Party
``would wish to associate ourselves entirely with your remarks
about the tragedy in Germany.''
	   In Germany, soldiers from a British army base at Herford, 80
miles (130 kms) from the crash site, were among the first at the
scene, spokesman Paul Barnard said, Press Association, the British
news agency reported.
	   ``The request for help came in fairly quickly from the German
authorities because they were aware there were British troops
nearby,'' said Barnard.
	   Troops dispatched were from the Royal Fusiliers is based at
Celle, which is the nearest town to the accident. Two other
specialist regiments, the 1 Armored Field Ambulance Regiment and
the 32 Engineer Regiment, both based nearby in Bergen-Hohne, were
put on standby.

Kaunda to consider role as peace mediator 
</HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda said
Wednesday he will consider an offer to be an African peace mediator
and roving ambassador.
	   But Kaunda, 74, freed Monday after five months under house
arrest, insisted the offer brokered by regional leaders would not
force him to retire from political life in Zambia.
	   ``I will always put Zambia first and I will die fighting for my
country,'' he told reporters in Lusaka.
	   Kaunda said Wednesday he was told of an offer to revive a
dormant peace foundation he started after his defeat in Zambia's
first democratic elections in 1991.
	   His role would be ambassador at large with financial backing
from donors, possibly including South Africa.
	   A similar mediating role is held by Tanzania's former President
Julius Nyerere, who is believed to have intervened in getting
Kaunda released, the South African Press Association reported
Wednesday.
	   ``If leaders wish to honor me this way, I will discuss it with
colleagues and consider it very seriously,'' Kaunda said.
	   In Cape Town Tuesday, South African President Nelson Mandela
denied reports that Kaunda's release was based on a promise to
Zambia's president by regional leaders that they would persuade
Kaunda from returning to politics.
	   Kaunda leads the opposition against Zambia's President Frederick
Chiluba.
	   But on Wednesday, Mandela said he hoped that Kaunda would be
able to recognize the importance of stepping down from party
politics and ``try to help Chiluba in uniting the country.''
	   He made the remark after lunching with former Botswana President
Ketumile Masire in Cape Town.
	   ``We all feel relieved that President Chiluba has taken this
step and we hope from now on positive things will follow,'' Masire
said.
	   Kaunda was arrested on Christmas and charged with concealing
prior knowledge of last October's plot by junior military officers
to topple Chiluba. The attempt was quickly crushed by loyal troops.
	   After the state dropped charges against him Monday, Kaunda said
he was organizing a convention of his United National Independence
Party to heal a rift in its ranks and decide on his future.
	   Kaunda led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964. His 27
years of dictatorial socialist rule were blamed for bankrupting one
of southern Africa's poorest nations.
	   The failed coup attempt triggered a declaration of martial law
that opposition parties claimed was an excuse to crack down on
opponents.

	   MALAYSIA Shipyard and Engineering (MSE) Sdn Bhd will deliver two
of its four contracted oil tankers to two Indonesian companies by
July 11.
	   P.T. Layar Sentosa Shipping Corporation and P.T Bumi
International Tankers have each ordered two of the said tankers.
	   MSE chief executive officer Abdul Rahim Abdul Rahman told
Business Times in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that despite the current
economic problems affecting most of East and South-East Asia, the
contract with the Indonesian companies is ``still going on''.
	   Abdul Rahim was asked on the status of the contract for the
construction of the four oil tankers which was signed late last
year, given the current economic situation in Indonesia.
	   He said the remaining two tankers are expected to be delivered
by October.
	   Abdul Rahim said works on building the first two tankers, which
measured 108m by 19m and weighing 6,500 deadweight tonnes each,
commenced at the end of August last year.
	   He said the order delivered earlier than scheduled because the
Indonesian companies want to take delivery of the tankers early so
that the vessels can be used for chartering purposes.
	   Earlier reports said that the tankers were supposed to be
delivered early next year and they are expected to be used on a
long-term time charter to Pertamina, Indonesia's oil corporation.
	   Abdul Rahim declined to reveal the total value of the project,
merely indicating that the prices quoted by MSE in its bidding for
the tender to build the tankers were ``very competitive''.
	   ``We won the contract last year, after competing against several
other established international shipyards,'' he added.

U.S. ambassador: nuclear proliferation not only U.S. problem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The threat of nuclear proliferation has
to be confronted by the whole world, not only the United States,
the U.S. ambassador to Israel said Wednesday.
	   The ambassador, Edward Walker, was evasive when asked whether
Washington's failure to prevent last month's nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan was a blow to U.S. credibility and would undermine
other areas of U.S. foreign policy, such as Mideast peacemaking.
	   ``I don't follow the India-Pakistan problem closely,'' Walker
said. ``I think the question of nuclear testing and so on is one
that involves the whole world and not just the United States.''
	   An Israeli military analyst said he believed Middle Eastern
countries now seeking nuclear capability, such as Iran and Iraq,
would be encouraged by recent events.
	   ``The meaning for the Middle East is that countries in region
who want to have nuclear testing will know the United States may be
unable to prevent them,'' said the analyst Ephraim Kam of Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
	   Other analysts said they believed the U.S. failure to prevent
the nuclear tests would also spill over into Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking and encourage Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to defy the Clinton administration on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``Privately, senior members of the Netanyahu Cabinet are
sketching a portrait of a Clinton administration that is weak in
foreign policy matters, which leads to questions about the U.S.
commitment to the peace process,'' David Makovsky wrote in the
Haaretz daily.

<TEXT>
	   OIL and gas consumption in Asia will continue to grow in 1998,
albeit at a slower pace, an economist said yesterday.
	   British Petroleum Plc (BP) chief economist Professor Peter A.
Davies said oil consumption is expected to grow at 2 per cent or
about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in Asia this year.
	   ``This is lower compared with 5-6 per cent growth of oil
consumption or 700,000 bpd before the economic problems started,''
he told a news conference organised by BP Malaysia Sdn Bhd.
	   Davies, who is currently in Kuala Lumpur to attend the Third
Asia Oil  Gas Conference, said history has shown that energy
consumption is closely linked to economic activity.
	   ``Therefore, it is inevitable that as economic growth declines
through much of Asia, growth of energy consumption will also
decline,'' he added.
	   Asia generates about one-third of the world's oil and gas.
	   He said, however, for some economies which went through economic
transitions, oil and energy consumption did not decline as much as
economic growth during a period of downturn.
	   ``Then again, as the economy recovers, energy consumption is
initially less than that of the gross domestic product growth,'' he
said.
	   Davies said Asia's oil and gas industry saw a drastic drop in
demand in the first quarter of this year, due to the financial
disruptions in several economies.
	   ``I suspect that would be the worst period. The future energy
consumption growth of the region will now depend on how fast the
region will recover,''
	   he said.
	   He said the oil and gas industries in South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia, where economic changes have been greatest in recent
months, are the worst hit.
	   Davies also said oil prices for Asian brent crude have fallen
from US$20 (US$1    RM3.96) per barrel in November last year to only
US$14 per
barrel today, down by 30 per cent.	   ``The cause of price decline was the coincidence of a series of
negative factors: the Asian economic slowdown and El Nino both
adversely affecting demand and rises in Iraqi exports, the Jakarta
Opec agreement to raise quotas and the strength of oil production
globally all positively influencing supply,'' he said.
	   However, he added that there is no reason to believe that the
price has to stay down.
	   ``In the past, prices have recovered for a number of reasons -
cold weather and production cuts by leading oil and gas producers.
	   ``Nonetheless, this time, the cold weather alone will not be
sufficient to rescue the market and prices as in the winter 1993/4.
The market will require further production cuts for prices to
recover,'' he said.
	   Davies said currently, the world production of oil stands at 75
million bpd, with a market surplus of some 1 million bpd this year.
	   ``It seemed clear that at the moment there is a surplus of oil
production over consumption. We can see this happening based on the
inventories of oil which have been rising very rapidly in all major
centres across the world.
	   ``The debate therefore within the industry is: How much
production needs to be cut? The reality is that for the market to
rebound, we need to have production cuts in the near future,'' he
said.
	   Davies said many oil and gas producers are expecting to see cuts
enacted at the upcoming Opec meeting on June 24.
	   However, he added, production capacity looks set to exceed
demand well into 1999.
	   ``Today's inventories of oil stand at 1 trillion barrels. This
means that we would still have enough oil to last us some 40 years
even if we stopped producing them,'' he said, adding that there is
certainly no sign of the world running out of oil.
	   Like other major oil and gas producers, Davies said, BP is
committed to this region, ``but this is just part of our
portfolio''.
	   ``By having a global portfolio, we are protected from any
slowdown or difficulties in one particular area.
	   ``As a result, we (BP) are still posting profits and we still
have very ambitious growth targets which have not been derailed by
the current economic situation,'' he said.
	   Davies said BP's future investments will be influenced by market
conditions in a particular country.
	   ``We will invest in light of opportunities ... and on a
case-by-case basis. We will carry on with those commitments which
we think are sound investments,'' he said.

	   ONE way of decreasing the number of cars on the road and hence
reducing air pollution from the combustion of petrol and diesel is
to use public transportation.
	   Unfortunately, this is still not a widespread practice in our
country mainly because our public transportation is unreliable.
	   We cite an example of how difficult and frustrating it can be to
get from Teluk Pulai to Bandar Sunway on a weekday in the morning
using a combination of the KTM Komuter train and Intrakota bus.
	   The KTM ride from Teluk Pulai to Subang Jaya should only take
about 30 minutes.
	   But often, because of a delay and/or breakdown, this trip can
take up to an hour.
	   The Intrakota feeder bus from the KTM station at Subang Jaya to
Bandar Sunway is even more unreliable.
	   The bus is supposed to leave the station every 30 minutes
between 6.15am and 10.15pm.
	   But most of the bus drivers refuse to leave the station on
schedule if there are only a few passengers and, typically, one may
have to wait an hour or two! Moreover, some drivers respond rudely
if you ask them when they plan to leave.
	   Oddly, all the drivers leave the bus engine and air-condition
unit running while waiting to depart even if there are no
passengers on board.
	   This practice is not only uneconomical for Intrakota but it also
generates air pollution unnecessarily.
	   We called the Intrakota hotline in mid-March but all we got was
a recording that asked us to leave our complaint and that the
company would get back to us.
	   But we have not heard from them. Neither has the bus service
improved.
	   We conducted a random survey of the buses' departure time from
the Subang Jaya KTM station to Bandar Sunway from March 30 to April
2 from 7.25am.
	   The waiting time was between 45 minutes and one hour 45 minutes.
	   No one can afford to wait up to two hours before the bus leaves
the KTM station.
	   The only practical but expensive alternative is to take a taxi
to Bandar Sunway.
	   The taxi drivers, knowing our dilemma, are unscrupulous.
	   They refuse to use the meter and instead charge each passenger
an exorbitant amount, typically twice the metered fare.
	   In order for public transportation to be a viable and attractive
alternative to owning a car, both trains and feeder buses must run
reliably in tandem.
	   Many countries have a reliable public transportation. Why can't
we?

	   TOKYO, Tue: Japan may have its own economic worries but it also
has what it takes to resuscitate the economies of East Asia, Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.
	   He said Japan is the richest depressed country in the world and
its capacity to grow and to be the locomotive of growth for the
region is still there. It has largely cleaned up the bad practices
of the past, and its Government, businessmen and people should now
rehabilitate their confidence and rebuild their economy quickly.
	   ``You have the capital, the technology, the skills and
everything else needed to grow your economy. You should employ all
these assets and provide the lead that the region needs,'' Dr
Mahathir said at the Institute for International Monetary Affairs'
symposium on ``Revitalisation of Japanese and East Asian
Economies'' here today.
	   He said Japan should buy the products of East Asian countries in
order to enrich them, and help in making East Asia a market for
itself and the world.
	   ``In Malaysia we are still looking East. Many have asked us why,
when it is so obvious that Japan has failed. We admit that in
several areas Japan has failed. But even failures provide lessons
for us. There are still many things we can learn from you. Your
exceptional skills, your technology, your discipline and work
ethics are still worth copying,'' Dr Mahathir said.
	   He said what Malaysia and the rest of the region need is a
revival of Japanese investments, to create jobs, to enrich the
people, stimulate economic growth and incidently to create good
markets for Japan.
	   ``Some of the money the Japanese Government is pumping into your
economy could very well be pumped into the troubled economies of
East Asia. As before when Japanese investments created prosperity
for East Asia and in turn provided good markets for Japan's
products, Japanese money to revive East Asian economies would
benefit these countries and Japan,'' he added.
	   As for Malaysia, Dr Mahathir said the only way it can overcome
the instability in the exchange rate and to rebuild its economy is
to do away with currency in trade as much as possible.
	   ``We will revert to bartering. We would want to balance our
trade with countries which have a trade surplus with us and Japan
is the country with the biggest trade surplus. Where we have to pay
we will pay in the currency of the trading partner concerned,'' he
said.
	   Dr Mahathir said regionally there is agreement among the Asean
economies that trade between them should be enhanced as the
devaluation of their currencies is approximately at the same rate.
	   ``We will also use our own currencies and balance our trade.
This arrangement will probably be permanent, unless of course a new
international financial system is put in place which will reduce
violent fluctuations of exchange rate,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir said Malaysia intends to revitalise its own economy
through several local measures. It will take note of the various
criticisms directed at it by market forces and will study their
said effect on Malaysian economy including the recent devaluation
of the ringgit.

	   I BELIEVE parents took great relief and comfort from the news
``Matriculation fees: Mara to help students'' (NST, May 28).
	   The assurance given by the Minister of Education that most
students who got places in private colleges under the universities'
franchise programmes would get sponsorship of about RM8,000 a year
to cover fees and living costs was a very pleasant gift.
	   With all their financial worries now behind them, students must
now show gratitude by doing well in studies and complete their
tertiary education with distinction and honour.
	   The article, however, mentioned that ``there would be students
who might not get sponsorship but these would be those who were
well off''. For ease of discussion I would interpret that the
well-off students are those whose parents have a combined income of
more than RM100,000 a year.
	   I would like to ask whether it is fair to force these well-off
students who are placed in private colleges to pay more than those
students who are doing similar matriculation courses in selected
boarding schools, and universities.
	   On average, private colleges charge about RM6,000 as fees -
which includes lodging (without meals) - for matriculation courses.
	   Matriculation students in private colleges, depending on their
ability, may complete their courses in two, three or four
semesters. Therefore, those in private colleges will have to pay
about RM11,400, RM16,800 or RM22,000 depending on how long they
take.
	   The total fees for matriculation courses in selected boarding
schools, and universities are only 25 to 30 per cent of that
charged by the private colleges.
	   Students and parents were not informed of the universities'
franchise programmes and the scale of fees levied by the private
colleges for matriculation courses.
	   If they had known, they would certainly have discussed with the
students their ability to finance such education.
	   Parents may encourage their offspring to take up a three-year
diploma course followed by a degree later, or to do Form Six,
followed by a diploma or degree course where the fees are within
their budget.
	   However, it is too late to reapply now.
	   It is neither the students' nor the parents' fault.
	   The so-called well-off students should not be discriminated
against or made a victim of circumstances. Decisions were made
based on available facts and information in the guidebook. They
applied for matriculation courses at the universities, but
certainly not at the private colleges, and of course were not even
aware that the fees would be six to seven times higher.
	   I understand that the purpose of franchise programmes with
private colleges is to increase the number of places for
matriculation students. I am grateful. I fully support it, but
certainly not on the cost factor, or the manner in which it has
been imposed on the students/parents.
	   The total cost is too expensive for a foundation or pre-degree
programme. The cost should have been published in the guidebook. It
is material information and a deciding factor for the students and
the parents.
	   I appeal to the authorities to reduce this total cost for the
franchise programme in the private colleges to a more reasonable
and acceptable level.
	   It would also be fair to inform the students on the selection
criteria for a matriculation place in the universities' campuses or
selected boarding schools where the fees will be much lower than
the private colleges.
	   If they do not meet the grade, they may then choose to apply for
a place at private colleges under the universities' franchise
programmes and pay for the higher fees as published.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO, Tues: As Asia's financial turmoil approaches a full year
without signs of abating, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad today renewed his call for a reform of the ``messy,
unreliable and destructive''
	   international financial system.
	   The Prime Minister told a conference of economists here that
reform should aim at ensuring currency stability and check the
activities of currency speculators.
	   Dr Mahathir said with the invention of arbitrage and futures
trading, the need for exchange rate stability for trading has given
way to the desire of currency traders to make massive amounts of
money in the shortest possible time.
	   ``Everything points to the need for an international financial
system which will bring about stability in the exchange rates among
other things.
	   ``It would be a sad commentary on the ability of the world's
financial and economic geniuses if they cannot come up with
proposals on a new international financial system,'' he said at the
Institute for International Monetary Affairs' symposium on
``Revitalisation of the Japanese Economy and the Future of Asia''.
	   Dr Mahathir said fixed exchange rate is no longer possible or
realistic, as the political, economic and social performance of a
country will have an effect on the value of its currency.
	   He said if a country is having a revolution it is likely that
its currency would be less acceptable and therefore should be
devalued.
	   As for the economy there are various indices which can be given
points indicating its strength and therefore the currency.
	   ``It is not beyond the capacity of the world's great economists
to devise a measurement of the economic performance of a country
using its political, economic and social indicators and then
determine the relative value of its currency.
	   ``The currency traders can still speculate but whether they buy
or sell should not affect the value of the currency.
	   ``This is of course only a suggestion. The financial experts and
the economists may laugh but it will stop the currency traders from
laughing all the way to the bank,'' Dr Mahathir added.
	   Dr Mahathir said the habit of economic experts to attribute the
turmoil to bad practices by governments sounds much like an apology
and in defence of the currency traders.
	   ``Money does not know whether a Government is good or bad and
react by adjusting its rate of exchange. Somebody is doing that and
is evidently making a lot of profit. Do we need to protect these
people's interest at the expense of world trade?''
	   Dr Mahathir said there is nothing to indicate the need for
currency trading other than the vast profits that can be made by
currency traders.
	   On the converse, the extent of the damage to the economies of
whole countries and regions that currency trading can inflict is
well-known.
	   The excuse that currency trading provides market forces with the
means to discipline governments is totally unacceptable, he said,
as currency traders thrive on unstable currencies.
	   ``It is ridiculous to suggest that they would discipline
governments and reward them with exchange rate stability when such
stability will deprive the traders of their opportunities to make
money,'' he said.
	   He said devaluation or revaluation are not the answers to the
world's economic problems.
	   Improvements in productivity can be achieved through greater
skills, better management and continuous technological
improvements.
	   Dr Mahathir said as much as the East Asian region grew together
by working together, they must also now work together to get out of
the present economic morass.
	   ``We must do this because we cannot allow corruptive influences
to determine who supplies us with what,'' he said.

	   IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are
initially for pain relief. This is followed by drugs that stop the
underlying disease process and reduce inflammation.
	   Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and
pain-relieving medicines are used to control them. They include
paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
locally applied linaments and ointments.
	   In the last five years, a better understanding of various
rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies.
	   That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant
treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example,
cyclosporin.
	   In the last two years, Cox-2 selective NSAIDs (meloxicam) have
been introduced around the world for pain relief in rheumatic
disorders. They are said to be safer than existing NSAIDs in
causing less gastrointestinal complications.
	   Up to now, all existing NSAIDs are known to cause gastric
irritation.
	   A certain herbal product has been tried in rheumatic disorders
in Denmark. It is based on the patented ginger extract HMP-33 which
is extracted from a special variety of ginger found only in one
particular region in China.
	   Developed over six years by a Danish team led by biochemist Dr
Morten Weidner, it comes in a soft gelatin capsule. It was recently
introduced here and is available over the counter.
	   Apparently, one capsule has properties equivalent to 6,600mg of
dried ginger.
	   The largest and most recent trial to test the efficacy and
safety of HMP-33 was conducted two years ago by a team of doctors
from Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, headed by chief rheumatologist
Dr Henning Bliddal and principal clinical investigator Dr Allan
Rosetzsky.
	   Dr Bliddal and his team had carried out a random double-blind
placebo-controlled study on 56 hospital patients suffering from
osteoarthritis.
	   The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from
bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects.
	   Similar clinical studies are currently being carried out in
Australia and the United States.
	   Generally, says a local doctor who requested anonymity, herbal
products are not as well tested in clinical trials as medications
which have to be registered for use in hospital pharmacies.
	   He adds trials with ginger extracts in rheumatic disorders have
not been actively carried out in Malaysia and local doctors are
awaiting confirmatory tests before recommending such products to
patients.
	   Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying
disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for
rheumatic patients.
	   Some patients may need disease modifying drugs to prevent
fibrosis of the tissues and joints and possibly internal organ
damage. Examples of such drugs include sulphasalazine, chloroquine,
penicillamine, gold and methotrexate.
	   Steroids in the correct amount and for the proper duration of
treatment are given to patients to reduce inflammation which may
damage the body.
	   However, these are also the most commonly abused drugs because
they are mixed illegally into herbal remedies.
	   Rheumatic disorders cover all medical diseases of the motoric
system - bones, joints, muscles and tendons - as well as those
related to the connective tissue.
	   The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis
elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
	   That means the treatment of each rheumatic disorder is
individualised and aimed at the cause and source of the pain as
well as underlying inflammation.
	   Based on Government hospital attendance records one in four
Malaysians above 40 visits outpatient clinics for a rheumatic
complaint. This is probably the same in private clinics.

	   Foreign fund managers showed concerns over the Japanese yen,
which fell to 139.75 to the dollar, its lowest in seven years.
	   The weakening yen has put pressure on other currencies in the
region, with the peso slipping to 39.47.
	   ``We are being dragged by the drop in the Japanese yen and the
Hongkong market, where everyone is focused. No foreign funds are
coming in,'' Jose Ricardo Garcia, an analyst at Diversified
Securities Inc., said. ``Local investors just cannot prop up the
market alone.''
	   ``Even with our gross domestic product still on the positive
side, foreign fund managers are shrugging it off. They have not yet
gotten over the problems of last year and are still downscaling
their portfolio,'' said Grace Cerdena, an analyst at F. Yap
Securities Inc.
	   ``They are there waiting, but because of the regional drought,
something is telling them not to get both their feet wet and are
just waiting for stocks to again reach bargain levels,'' she said.
	   Analysts said with the Philippines unable to isolate itself from
regional developments, the composite index had yet to find a
bottom.
	   Cerdena said a good support level was at 1,800.
	   ``There will be short-term players in the market. There might be
a short rally tomorrow, with bargain-hunting on oversold issues,
but any rally will not be sustainable,'' said Henry Ong of Sapphire
Securities Inc.
	   ``Foreign funds are losing their weightings on the region.
Everyone is waiting for the 1,800 level, which we will likely see
in the near term,''
	   said Allan Araullo, vice-president at Regina Capital Development
Corp.
	   ``We are looking at a recession in the region. But at these
levels, there are people who started to hunt for bargains.
Tomorrow, the downside may be limited considering how deep prices
have gone,'' said Teresa Lee, assistant vice-president at Asiamerit
Securities.
	   Trading was very thin, with only 397.09 million shares
accounting for a value turnover of P821.77 million. The selling
pressure resulted in decliners swamping gainers 110 to 14, with 24
issues unchanged.
	   Five of the six sub-indices suffered steep declines.
	   Among the active losers were Ayala Land Inc., Meralco B, Petron
Corp., San Miguel Corp. B, Ayala Corp., and Metropolitan Bank and
Trust Co.
	   Property companies shrugged off the further cut in Treasury bill
rates as brokers said regional concerns far outweighed positive
local news.
	   Besides, the declining interest rates were unlikely to be
sustained, they added.
	   Diversified concern Metro Pacific Corp. fell P0.18, or 11.69%,
to a three-month low of P1.36 on worries over the fate of its
parent, the Salim Group of Indonesia following Suharto's ouster.
	   ``The story behind Metro Pacific is the fear of fund managers
about the Salim group now that there's a change in administration
in Indonesia,'' said Carl Valentin, analyst at Asia Pacific Capital
Equities  Securities Corp.
	   The rise of the Salim Group is closely associated with the rule
of former President Suharto, who is a friend of the group's head

	   I REFER to the letter, ``Allowing anglers to fish in marine
parks is not the solution'' (NST, May 22) by Wan Jamil of Alor
Star.
	   The Department of Fisheries has no intention at all, now or in
future, of allowing fishing/angling to be carried out within the
marine parks' waters, because these are considered critical areas
where it is believed most of our marine life breed, forage or seek
refuge and protection from predators.
	   The marine parks of Malaysia are managed and administered by the
Department of Fisheries, which is under the Agriculture Ministry.
	   The department manages and administers the Marine Parks under
sections 41 till 45 of the Fisheries Act 1985 (amended in 1993).
	   Furthermore, under the same Act, the National Advisory Council
for Marine Parks and Marine Reserves has been created to give
advice on policy matters to the Minister of Agriculture.
	   The council is chaired by the secretary-general of the Ministry
of Agriculture and the members are from all sectors - that is,
government officers (both Federal and State), representatives from
non-governmental organisations, academicians from local
universities and managers from the private sector.
	   The council also acts as an overseer on actions taken by the
department concerning marine parks.
	   The department encourages the development of recreational
fishing (or sport fishing), because it is a very healthy hobby and
will become a very important economic activity, including providing
additional income for traditional fishermen from the rural areas.
	   However, it is believed that its development should be orderly,
rational and well managed so that it is sustainable.
	   The department has to ensure that there is no conflict between
the anglers and the traditional fishermen because they could be
fishing in the same areas and also that the fisheries resources are
not over-exploited but are properly managed.
	   Because of this, the Department of Fisheries has drafted a
regulation for recreational fishing in Peninsular Malaysia but it
has not been gazetted yet and thus not enforced.
	   In this draft regulation, there is a provision for the
Department of Fisheries to zone certain areas outside the marine
park areas for certain purposes or for the use of certain fishing
appliances only.
	   There is no provision in this draft regulation to empower the
department to allow fishing within the marine park areas. Section
43 of the Fisheries Act 1985 forbids any form of fishing within the
marine park areas.
	   I would like to repeat here that the department has no intention
to amend any law to allow fishing within the marine park areas
because they are considered as very important and critical areas
for the proper usage and management of the fisheries resources of
the country.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea and Ethiopia, dimming hopes for a
peaceful solution to their border dispute, Wednesday accused each
other of cross-border attacks.
	   Eritrea charged Ethiopia with using tanks and heavy artillery in
an attack early Wednesday on the frontier village of Ambesete
Geleba, 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Ethiopia of
provoking ``a new and dangerous escalation'' of the border crisis,
and said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on
Eritrean positions.
	   Hours later, Ethiopian accused Eritrean troops of attacking near
Aiga and Alitena, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) on the Ethiopian
side of a natural border formed by the Mereb River.
	   ``Eritrea thought it could get away with shifting the blame to
Ethiopia,'' the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Both countries have consistently denied invading the other's
territory.
	   No details were available on any casualties in either attack.
	   However, Ethiopia's state-run radio accused Eritrea of publicly
executing three Ethiopian civilians it said were abducted by
Eritrean troops during an earlier cross-border raid.
	   Another 30 civilians were in the custody of the Eritrean army
and their fate was unknown, said Kiros Bitow, a local official. He
said about 24,700 Ethiopians had been displaced in the Badme and
Sheraro areas following Eritrean invasions.
	   Ethiopia first made public the border dispute between the two
Horn of Africa neighbors on May 13, calling on Eritrea to withdraw
from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of illegally occupying a
415-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) area known as the Yirga
triangle in northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half-dozen smaller areas
along the border. But the underlying causes of the conflict are
economic, diplomats and businessmen say.
	   Relations between the one-time allies in a long war against the
former Marxist government of Ethiopia soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November, triggering a trade war
that has hurt both economies and reduced cross-border commerce to a
trickle.
	   Eritrea on Wednesday repeated a call for a total
demilitarization of border areas and outside mediation to solve the
dispute. Ethiopia said it was cooperating with peace negotiators.
	   For the past two weeks, U.S. diplomats and regional leaders have
shuttled between the two countries in a desperate effort to restore
peace that has showed no signs of success.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.

French put in hard day before dinner with Les Bleus' First Fan Eds : Will be updated with president's visit 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Despite a fit squad, speculation
continued to surround the French team Wednesday on who will be
dropped from its World Cup starting lineup. It was something even
beyond the team's first fan _ President Jacques Chirac.
	   With coach Aime Jacquet remaining quiet amidst much juggling of
the team the past two weeks, rumors swirled that even leading
scorer Youri Djorkaeff could be benched for France's June 12 opener
against South Africa.
	   ``You cannot just stick to what has already been set out. You
need a breath of fresh air,'' Jacquet said. ``I prefer movement,
even if it's not major.''
	   Some fear that too much movement could unbalance the team.
	   Chirac also caused some commotion, forcing the squad to another
field for training so his helicopter could land at the
Clairefontaine complex for a dinner with the full team.
	   ``We welcome the first among the French. It is a moment of
pride,'' Jacquet said.
	   ``This is super,'' Djorkaeff added. ``It's a great joy for a
player to have this opportunity. Not everybody can do this.''
	   It was also a welcome distraction after he was mentioned as a
possible ``super'' substitute, or joker, nicknamed SuperDjorker.
	   Djorkaeff has been a key member of France's squad throughout
Jacquet's four-year tenure and has scored 17 goals in 37 games.
	   ``I'm part of the Jacquet system, I even partly created it. I
can't see why I should be excluded now. Why a joker,'' he said.
	   Jacquet's main problems have been who to select for the front,
where scoring is the big headache.
	   Offensively, the team has been built around Zinedine Zidane and
Djorkaeff, but the sudden emergence of Thierry Henry and Robert
Pires on the wings could alter Jacquet's plans and force him to
drop a player in the middle.
	   And since Zidane's place is beyond any reasonable doubt,
Djorkaeff has become the target.
	   ``Personally I know I will be on the team against South
Africa,'' said Djorkaeff, still oozing confidence.
	   Denmark and Saudi Arabia complete Group C.
	   In midfield, Real Madrid's Christian Karembeu had been assumed
as a certainty, especially since he should be much fitter after
having played only half a season. But a disappointing few weeks
have cast major doubt on his place and increased the chances of
Arsenal Emmanuel Petit. Jacquet benched Karembeu for a preparation
game last week.
	   ``I was so frustrated. I wanted to play and I was on the bench,
powerless,'' he said.

France throws open her doors for World Cup, but the welcome mat is daunting AP Special Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France has thrown open her doors for the 1998 World
Cup, but _ what with strikes, demonstrations and chaos _ furious
visitors are having to fight their way across the welcome mat.
	   ``This place is a catastrophe, a national humiliation,''
muttered Amer Houari, a Parisian cabbie who waited three hours for
an airport fare despite long lines of passengers desperate for a
taxi.
	   ``And tomorrow is likely to be even worse,'' he added. ``It
seems like the only thing we French are good at is wreaking
havoc.''
	   Air France pilots struck Monday, canceling up to 90 percent of
international flights by the official World Cup carrier a little
over a week before the kickoff of a month of matches.
	   The pilots threatened to stay out for two weeks, but talks
continued in an effort to find a compromise.
	   Meanwhile, Paris is already jammed for the French Open tennis
tournament and the annual French arms fair at Le Bourget airport.
	   Passengers who managed to find alternate flights to Charles de
Gaulle Airport discovered that baggage handlers were also on
strike, and luggage was dumped into a roiling sidewalk crowd
outside.
	   ``Is Paris always like this?'' asked Lily Goh, from Singapore,
as her delicate orchid corsage wilted in the chaotic crush. ``We
spent 13 hours flying and 10 hours waiting for our bags.''
	   Her husband, who had come to set up a World Cup exhibition, was
seeking their luggage among a multinational maelstrom of families,
business travelers, confused policemen and customs officers.
	   Marilyn Barry, a New Yorker who had organized a canal barge trip
for friends and family, gave up trying to locate a group which had
come in on another airline. Her humor was wearing thin.
	   ``What a disgrace,'' repeated Marguerite Tinguy, a Frenchwoman,
as she tried to find someone to answer questions.
	   At the airport information booth, hostesses shrugged, as bemused
as everyone else. Police officers brusquely refused help,
preoccupied with a snarl of buses, baggage trucks and people
pushing carts.
	   By afternoon, airlines simply gave up, and passengers had to lug
their own bags from planeside while baggage handlers watched,
amused.
	   And few of the new arrivals were aware of what was in store in
the days to follow.
	   Vague threats of terrorism hang in the air. Police arrested
three more people Wednesday because of intelligence that Islamic
groups may try to disrupt the Cup. So far, 90 suspects have been
detained around Europe.
	   On Thursday, left-leaning unions plan a ``national day of
action,'' including mass rallies at crucial points around Paris and
marches that would paralyze main thoroughfares.
	   Eight separate demonstrations were planned by workers in
transport, energy, public services, health, construction and
commerce.
	   Strikes were expected to at least partially disrupt the Paris
metro on Thursday and long-distance trains on Friday.
	   In addition, railway workers called a one-day strike for June
10, the day the World Cup opens. It was not clear which trains
would be affected.
	   For most Frenchmen, ire seemed directed at Air France pilots for
exploiting the World Cup to dramatize their wage complaints.
	   As the state airline privatizes, pilots have rejected a plan to
receive stock in exchange for lower wages. Some Air France captains
earn more than dlrs 200,000 a year, 40 per cent more than
comparable Lufthansa salaries.
	   National political leaders condemned ``a shameful
embarrassment'' after four years of planning for a trouble-free
World Cup.
	   But some French shrugged off the dispute as yet another
manifestation of workers' right to strike.
	   The popular Paris tabloid daily ``Liberation'' caught the mood,
a mixture of outrage and perverse pride, with its Tuesday front
page.
	   A drawing showed a blue-white-red airplane with the grinning
face of a beret-wearing Frenchman in place of the nose. The wings
were formed by a long baguette sandwich clamped in his teeth.
	   The headline read: ``Pilots: A Strike Like Only the French Can
Manage.''

	   Does your chest go up and down when you breathe? Do you have a
quick respiratory rate and little use of the diaphragm? Do you have
irregular or interrupted breathing? Do you frequently sigh? If so,
you have the hyperventilation syndrome, which is chronic rapid
breathing.
	   Hyperventilation is a common symptom in the seven major
psychosomatic diseases like asthma, hypertension, ulcer, rheumatoid
arthritis, and neurodermatitis. It is also seen in migraine,
chronic pain of any origin, seizure disorders, heart disease, and
among smokers. Psychiatric disorders have profound effects on both
method and rate of breathing. Chronic anxiety creates, and is
exacerbated by, upper chest breathing and an irregular, rapid
breathing of 18.3 bpm. Panic disorder can raise the resting breath
rate to 30 bpm. Researchers have also found that when psychiatric
patients show clinical improvement, their breath rate often drops.
	   Hyperventilation may be a common symptom of a disease, but it
doesn't necessarily follow that it causes disease. Diseases have
complex, multi-factorial origins, including physical trauma,
viruses, bacteria, lifestyle, state of mind, diet, genetic
predisposition, previous health history, and environment. Evidence
doesn't suggest that improper breathing can be a precipitating
factor in many disorders. It can also intensify or prolong pain or
disease symptoms. In some cases, proper breathing can provide a
cure.
	   For inhalation to take place, the lungs, like a balloon, must be
capable of expanding. The most efficient way to expand the lungs is
by contracting the diaphragm and relaxing the abdomen, allowing the
abdomen to expand. If the diaphragm is frozen with tension, then
the chest and rib cage must move instead. The abdomen may seem to
hardly move at all, creating a pattern of almost exclusively
thoracic respiration. Abdominal breathing seems to have some
analgesic effect. This may be due to the direct correspondence
between free movement of the diaphragm and alleviation of pain.
From traditional Chinese medicine's view, pain results from stuck
or stagnant chi. Freedom of physical movement creates freedom of
energetic movement -- chi flows and pain diminishes.
	   Thoracic breathing doesn't allow as much air into the lungs as
abdominal breathing. To compensate, the respiratory rate must
increase in order to maintain the same amount of air going into and
out of the lungs each minute.
	   Hyperventilation causes the blood to lose carbon dioxide (CO2)
more rapidly. Because CO2 is necessary for acid formation in the
body, its loss means that the blood's acid-base (pH) balance shifts
towards alkalinity (base). This decreases the ability of the
blood's hemoglobin molecules to release oxygen. Normally, oxygen is
a ``piggyback'' rider on the hemoglobin molecule, becoming
oxyhemoglobin. During hyperventilation, the bond becomes too tight;
the oxygen cannot let go. Thus, even though oxygen is in the blood,
less of it is delivered to the cells, which means less energy and
an impaired ability to carry on ordinary metabolic processes.
	   The decreased levels of oxygen in the tissues have an especially
pronounced effect on the heart and brain functions, as these organs
require a great deal of oxygen. There is also a direct connection
between hyperventilation and a tendency toward constriction and
spasms in the arteries that feed both the heart and the brain.
	   In the 1978 Journal of the American Medical Association, it was
reported that hyperventilation decreases the amount of oxygen
delivered to the heart's muscle or myocardium, causes abnormalities
in the EKG, and increases the cardiac workload. Hyperventilation is
known to be a contributing factor in ischemic (reduced blood flow)
heart disease, high blood pressure, coronary insufficiency, cardiac
arhythmia, and angina.
	   The brain comprises only 2% of the body weight yet consumes more
than 20% of the body's available oxygen. According to Dr. Robert
Fried of Hunter College who made some intensive researches on
breathing and respiratory therapies, ``Rapid breathing (i.e.
hyperventilation) reduces brain blood flow, while slow, deep
breathing enhances it, other factors being equal.''
	   Some forms of migraine are caused by chronic constriction and
dilation of the arteries feeding the brain. This can be
precipitated by emotional stress, diet, and rapid breathing. A loss
of oxygen supply to the brain cells can also cause anxiety, stroke,
and increased frequency of epileptic attacks.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of Russia, China and three Central
Asian countries will discuss regional security at a summit in
Kazakstan on July 3, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The meeting is intended to continue confidence-building measures
started at meetings in Shanghai in 1996 and Moscow in 1997, the
Kazak Foreign Ministry said.
	   Besides Russia and China, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
are expected to attend the meeting in Almaty, the former Kazak
capital.

	   LIKE K. Nair (NST, May 5), I too am suffering from a high level
of cholesterol.
	   Universiti Hospital has advised me to buy Zocor.
	   I was told the Government had decided to stop supplying
expensive medicine to the public, including pensioners.
	   A month's supply of Zocor (30 tablets) costs around RM145.00
which is far beyond the means of most pensioners.
	   What the Secretary of the Malacca Branch of the Government
Pensioner Association said (NST, May 21) may be correct.
	   But why can't the Government have hospitals supply the medicine
directly instead of asking pensioners to get a letter from the
relevant doctor in addition to the prescription, buy the medicine
and then submit the claim to the Public Service Department, for
payment which may take months?
	   The Government should be more caring and sympathetic instead for
making a pensioner who may be very old (I am almost 80) to go
through red tape just to get a little relief from suffering at the
final stages of life.

<TEXT>
	   ALPE DI PAMPEAGO, Italy (AP) _ Pavel Tonkov edged overall leader
Marco Pantani by one second Wednesday to claim the 18th stage of
the Tour of Italy after the race's top two riders made a late
breakaway on the final climb in the Alps.
	   The tough, 115-kilometer (71.3-mile) stage ended at an altitude
of 1,760 meters (5,808 feet) above sea level.
	   Pantani finished second for the second straight stage, and held
onto the pink jersey heading into the last four days. He leads
Tonkov, the 1996 Giro champion and runner-up last year, by 27
seconds in the overall standings.
	   Favorite Alex Zuelle, who had dominated the cycling classic
until it headed into the mountains, lost more time Wednesday. He
faltered on the final uphill pass and was fourth, 58 seconds behind
Russia's Tonkov. Zuelle now trails Pantani by more than two minutes
overall.

	   DEMAND for rice is expected to remain stable and this will
enable Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) to record satisfactory
growth for the financial year ending December 31 1998, says
managing director Mohd Ibrahim Mohd Nor.
	   Ibrahim says the continuous demand will put Bernas in a
comfortable position to progress further and to move into other
profitable business.
	   ``At the same time, we hope to improve the performance of
businesses that have not been operating at their full capacity,''
he says in his annual statement.
	   Bernas is currently engaged in the procuring and processing of
padi as well as importing, buying and selling rice.
	   The group is also responsible for the national rice stockpile,
and guarantees the minimum price of padi as well as the
distribution of subsidies to farmers on behalf of the Government.
	   Bernas posted a group pre-tax profit of RM38.66 million for the
financial year ended December 31 1997 compared with RM63.93 million
the previous year.
	   The group achieved a turnover of RM1.30 billion, an increase of
13 per cent from RM1.16 billion recorded in the previous year.
	   Profit after tax was RM21.99 million compared with RM63.85
million previously. Earnings per share fell from 21.3 sen to 7.2
sen.
	   Ibrahim says the drop in the group's profit was due to the
depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar in the second
half of last year.
	   Bernas has taken steps to ease the situation by purchasing rice
from Thailand using ringgit through its joint venture company,
which in turn buys from other local Thai suppliers in baht/or
ringgit.
	   Bernas has saved on hedging costs with the switch from the US
dollar.
	   The group has also moved into strategic alliances with relevant
business partners in areas such as seed production, large-scale
farming, and rice wholesaling and retailing.
	   ``By doing so, we hope to establish our presence at each level
of the rice value chain - starting from farming to retailing,'' he
says.
	   This will eventually reduce costs in maintaining both price and
supply stability in the industry as well as enhance its future
earnings, he adds.
	   The group has moved into packaging, food catering, engineering,
construction, shipping and transportation to complement current
activities.

	   State owned National Power Corp. (Napocor) yesterday said it has
approved the construction of three major generation plants
scheduled to be commissioned between January 2000 and January 2004.
	   The three projects set for implementation are the 200-megawatt
(MW) combined-cycle plant in Mindanao (year 2000), the Panay Coal
Plant (year 2003), and the 75-MW Samar Coal Plant (year 2004).
	   Total cost of the said projects was estimated to reach US$114.8
million.
	   The project cycle for the plants, including financing and actual
construction, would range from three to seven and a half years.
	   Napocor said the projects are to be implemented in anticipation
of a substantial 12% rise in energy requirements.
	   The Mindanao combined-cycle plant will use one of the 501-F
turbine units which were part of the settlement by Westinghouse for
the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. The new plant will be initially
operated as a simple-cycle facility in the year 2000 and will
operate as a full combined-cycle plant by early 2001.
	   The Panay coal plant will use indigenous coal resources using
clean coal technology and will be solicited under a
build-operate-own (BOO) scheme.
	   The 75-MW Samar coal plant will also be implemented under the
BOO scheme but will operate as a mined-mouth plant within the
Paranas and Hinabanga coal mines.
	   The said projects were approved by Napocor under the Power
Development Program (PDP) which was developed with the concept of
meeting future power requirements through coordinated addition of
required generation and transmission facilities.
	   The PDP charts Napocor's main thrusts in the short-, medium- and
long-term horizon. For the short-term, the program confirms the
need for the ongoing projects. For the medium-term, the program
identifies critical new projects that need urgent decisions. For
the long-term horizons, the program provides direction for future
courses of action based on current perceptions in economic trends
and technological advancements.

	   PADIBERAS Nasional Bhd has proposed to amend its memorandum and
articles of association to enable it to purchase its own shares and
to provide financial assistance to eligible persons for the
purchase of the company's shares. The proposal, approved by the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on April 29, still requires the
approval of its shareholders.
	   The company is also proposing to purchase its own shares in line
with Section 67A of the Companies Act 1965, which will allow the
company to acquire a maximum of 10 per cent of its existing issued
and paid-up share capital. If the company acquires the maximum
amount of shares that it is entitled, its issued and paid-up share
capital falls to 270 million ordinary shares of RM1 each, from 300
million ordinary shares of RM1 each as at April 30 1998.

	   IN civilian society, the crime of rape is dealt with swiftly
and, at most times, with appropriate justice.
	   The perpetrator is incarcerated, the trial is set and in most
circumstances, the victim is treated with respect and showered with
compassion.
	   Unfortunately, Canadians learnt recently that rape victims
within the Canadian military often cannot find the same extent of
justice.
	   Often, investigations are carried out internally and the ``boys
club syndrome'' inevitably applies.
	   Shocking revelations of sexual assault and sexual harassment
within the military has once again threatened the reputation of
Canadian soldiers.
	   The allegations came when Canada's premier news magazine,
MacLean's, published an exhaustive investigation into alleged cases
of persistent sexual harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces.
	   The allegations are serious, involving documented cases of
sexual assaults, sexual harassment, mishandling of complaints and
investigations by senior officers including deliberate obstruction
of investigations.
	   Equally shocking were revelations of a culture of promiscuity in
the Armed Forces, behaviour that included heavy drinking and women
being treated with scant respect.
	   The Defence Minister found himself on the defensive, unable to
provide answers to such shocking claims that ``rape is commonplace
in the military''.
	   We read that these women, trained to handle rifles, grenades and
machine guns, were told not to go out alone at night.
	   Their rapists were uniformed men, entrusted with the duty and
honour of protecting civilian lives.
	   Before the publication of the MacLean's story, military brass
has persistently denied that such problems exist.
	   Now, a full-scale investigation has been launched.
	   Bravo to responsible journalism! The Canadian Armed forces is
about 6,00 strong and women account for roughly 10 per cent of the
total.
	   Although only a few courageous ones came forward with their
story and grievances, it is expected that many more will do so.
	   By coming out of the closet, these women have done an
immeasurable service to other women.
	   In particular, their profound action has potentially saved the
lives of many new female recruits wanting to make a career in the
military.
	   History has repeatedly reminded us that it always takes the
actions of a courageous few to change the established order in
society.
	   Take Sheldon Kennedy, for example. He was a promising hockey
player who came forward with the truth about years of sexual
assault by his hockey coach.
	   It later turned out that such cases of abuse of power over young
hockey players had been going on for more years than anyone had
ever imagined.
	   Sheldon Kennedy's sole act of courage has served to save the
lives of countless young hockey players down the road.
	   Today, the very fact that the crime of rape is dealt with
seriously is also due largely to the courageous and persistent
efforts of women who refuse to let society point a finger at them
when such an inhuman crime occurs.
	   The country salutes the actions of these unsung heroes and
heroines.
	   The Canadian Armed Forces have launched a glitzy, pricey
campaign aimed at attacting more women to serve the country.
	   Whether or not public faith can be restored into this once
honourable institution will rest largely on how current
investigations unfold.

Italy's Agip awarded Angolan deepwater oil field concession 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ State oil company Sonangol announced
Wednesday that the Angolan affiliate of Italy's Agip has been
chosen to operate a new oilfield in deep water off the Angolan
coast.
	   The field, known as Block 25, covers a 4,852-square-kilometer
(3,008-square-mile) area in the sea off the coastal port of Lobito,
390 kilometers (241 miles) south of Luanda, according to a Sonangol
statement.
	   Agip Angola, in collaboration with U.S. company Esso, a
subsidiary of Exxon Corp., is negotiating a deal to share
production with Sonangol.
	   Agip has been active in Angola since 1982 and daily production
from its Angolan operations currently stands at 56,000 barrels a
day.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria.

	   Like fellow artist Juan Luna, Felix Resurrecion Hidalgo sought
international acclaim. He scored a few notable triumphs, but unlike
Luna, Hidalgo's achievements never received much attention.
	   Hidalgo was almost reclusive, preferring to paint in Paris while
the rest of this circle of Ilustrados -- Luna and Rizal among them
-- were more vocal in promoting the Filipino agenda in Spain. His
silence belied his participation in the nationalist ferment
generated by his friends.
	   It is but appropriate then that the publication of Alfredo
Roces' Hidalgo and the Generation of 1872 - the first and only
comprehensive account of Hidalgo's life and times, his achievements
and his passions -coincides with the country's Centennial
celebration.
	   Published by the Eugenio Lopez Foundation, Roces' coffee table
book places Hidalgo's life and times in the context of that
turbulent era of Spanish oppression and nascent Filipino
nationalism. Hidalgo and the Generations of 1872 offers a dramatic
account of Hidalgo and the other Ilustrados who triumphed in Europe
in the late 19th century, and whose exemplary artistic, literary,
and nationalistic feats remain unsurpassed a century later.
	   This coffee table book provides Philippine art aficionados a
glimpse at many of Hidalgo's most famous works as well as his
heretofore ``unknown'' or never-before-published paintings,
photographs, and various memorabilia.
	   With over 300 photographs by Dick Baldovino, Hidalgo and the
Generations of 1872 is a full-color, hardbound, limited edition
that promised to be a collector's item.
	   The book is available at the Lopez Museum for a limited
pre-launch offer of P5,000. To reserve copies, contact Fanny San
Pedro at 631-2417.
	   Caption: PEACE AND LIBERTY, painted in 1904 (three years after
the establishment of civil government in the Philippines),
celebrated the advent of America in this country in a manner almost
prophetic.

	   DEMAND for cement in the domestic market is expected to decline
this year, given the current economic downturn which has affected
the construction sector.
	   However, demand for the export market, particularly Singapore,
is expected to remain stable, says Malayan Cement Bhd chairman
Tunku Abdullah Tunku Abdul Rahman in his annual statement.
	   He says although the import of cement will be reduced, the
unfavourable demand combined with new capacity will result in a
more competitive environment.
	   ``The export markets are also extremely competitive on the back
of a growing surplus in the region, and while every effort will be
made to compete for export business, the prospects for the group as
a whole in 1998 are expected to be less favourable compared to
1997,'' he adds.
	   Malayan Cement posted a group pre-tax profit of RM172.28 million
for the financial year ended December 31 1997, up 7.6 per cent from
RM160.13 million previously.
	   Turnover was higher at RM921.94 million from RM652.89 in 1996.
	   However, profit after tax fell 3.8 per cent from RM149.61
million to RM143.90 million.
	   ``The drop in our profit after tax was due to the higher level
of re-investment tax allowance available in 1996,'' Tunku Abdullah
says.
	   Earnings per share was 32.1 sen against 36.2 sen before.
	   The group, in its financial report, says that the results were
calculated on a 13-month basis as Malayan Cement recently changed
its year-end to December 31.

	   THE best can be the enemy of the good. The misconceived notion
that things from foreign shores are superior to local products has
led to the retail industry's inclination to stuff shelves with
imported goods from ice cream to apparel. Not only has this
preference for foreign-made goods prejudiced our local industries
to a certain extent but it has also increased the yawning gap in
the balance of payments.
	   As many have discovered during the current economic downturn, it
is a costly affair to maintain such a preference. Now, those who
scorned locally produced goods in the past understand the economic
imperative of buying local as a means to ease inflationary
pressures. But the daily grapple with escalating prices of basic
food and medical charges has provoked many to question the potency
of the prescription in keeping inflation at bay. Businesses defend
their move to raise prices by pointing out to the burdensome
operating cost due to the increase in the price of imported
materials. They have a point. But it seems illogical that the cost
has to be passed on to the consumers. As it is, the public is
scalped in buying the food items and products since it ends up
subsidising the rising operating cost of the manufacturers and the
rising food bill of every service-provider from the hawker to the
taxi driver.
	   For many, continuous price hikes is an anxiety that does not
dissipate despite repeated assurances to monitor prices and keep
them at a reasonable level from the Domestic Trade and Consumer
Affairs Ministry.
	   Despite repeated calls from various quarters to control the
prices of essential food, education fees and medical costs so as
not to burden the poor, no visible effort has been taken towards
that direction. In a situation when the middle-class is struggling
with the price increases, one can only imagine the plight of the
poor. What we find worrying is the insensitive attitude of some
politicians and bureaucrats who argue that the citizenry, including
the lower-income group, should adjust and shape their lives to the
dictates of the current economic circumstances. True to a point.
	   But implicit in such argument is the notion that poverty is
inevitable during an economic crisis. The middle-class may wrestle
with the choice of buying ikan kembung at RM8.00 per kg or imported
beef at RM10 per kg but the poor cannot afford such a choice. If
the price of dried ikan sepat can horrify the Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs Minister, one can imagine the reaction of the
lower-income group, particularly those who earn less than RM900 per
month. The point is what is reasonable to the minister and the
average middle-class may not be reasonable to the poor. Poverty is
the nadir of disempowerment as illustrated by the decision of some
students from poor families to discontinue studies at the tertiary
level. There should be a vigorous effort to control the increases
in the prices of basic food. Surely, a proactive approach is better
than any hand-wringing exercise and expressions of sympathy at the
price increases by the authorities.
	   The upward changes of prices point to the lower margin of the
country's self-sufficiency and the depth of its dependence on food
imports. Efforts to be self-reliant in food production will bear
the cumulative effect of drastically reducing our hefty food import
bill of over RM11 billion. But such efforts do not obliviate the
authorities' responsibility in keeping a lid on rocketing prices
and in alleviating the burden of the less fortunate segment of our
society.

	   SEREMBAN, Mon. - Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad
today urged employers to encourage their staff to save.
	   He said all employees ranging from manual workers to executives
should attempt to set aside a certain amount every month.
	   Speaking after launching the State Employees' Savings Campaign
through the MNI Takaful Sdn Bhd's saving scheme at Samsung
Electronics Group (M) here, he said savings would not only benefit
each individual but also greatly help the country's economy.
	   ``For example, if each of the 7,500 employees in Samsung saved
RM10 per month, their savings would total RM900,000 for the year
which would greatly help boost the country's economy,'' he said.
	   He said if each of the 258 factories in the State would start
encouraging its employees to save, the country's economic recovery
would be hastened.
	   Also present were Labour Department director-general Tengku
Datuk Omar Tengku Bot, Samsung Electronics Group (M) president Kim
Jong Ki and MNI Takaful chairman Datuk Shaharuddin Haron.
	   Mohamad Isa said banks and financial institutions should also
intensify efforts in promoting the various savings and investment
schemes available as many were unfamiliar with the benefits.

	   JOHOR BARU, Mon. - It was a dream come true for two former
neighbours, meeting again on Saturday after 40 years.
	   British national Lyn Medland, 46, who left Malaysia about 40
years ago, and her former neighbour P. Paruvathy shed tears of joy
when they greeted each at the Causeway.
	   ``It is so wonderful ... I never thought this day will come,''
said Medland when met later at Paruvathy's house in Taman Johor
Jaya.
	   ``After several unsuccessful enquiries at the Malaysian and
Singapore High Commissions, the Malaysian Tourism Promotion Board
and British Army office, I had almost given up meeting Paru
again... we are half a world apart,'' she added.
	   Medland and her husband Clive Percival, who are on a cruise trip
to Singapore, stopped over here for a day.
	   Now living in Southampton, Medland was staying in Johor Baru
with her family from 1959 to 1960 when her father was serving with
the British Army's Jungle Warfare School (now Pulada in Kota
Tinggi).
	   Her intention to catch up with Paruvathy was highlighted in the
New Straits Times on April 23.
	   Paruvathy described the meeting as a miracle.
	   ``When I saw her at the Causeway, I was speechless ... We just
gave each other a very tight hug.''
	   Paruvathy used to work for the Medland family. The Medlands
wanted her to follow them when they moved to Seremban and then back
to England.
	   However, Paruvathy was unable to do so as she had to look after
her elderly mother, brothers and sisters. They lost touch with each
other as the Medlands were always on the move.
	   Paruvathy was only told of the article in the NST on May 20. She
sent a letter to Medland immediately after calling up the NST Johor
Baru bureau for her address in England.
	   Concerned that the letter might not reach Medland before she set
off on her cruise, Paruvathy sent a telegram on May 22. Paruvathy
also sought the help of her friends here who have connections in
England to inform Medland of her telephone number.
	   Medland said: ``I received a telephone message from a person who
said she had information about Paru on the morning of May 23. That
same evening, I received Paru's telegram.
	   ``I was so excited that I called Paru immediately to arrange for
a meeting here. Three days later, just shortly before my husband
and I set off, I received Paru's letter.''
	   Paruvathy and Medland literally took a trip down memory lane
when they visited Medland's previous house in Johor Baru, Pulada
and the Kota Tinggi waterfalls.

	   YEO Hiap Seng (M) Bhd, which expects its performance this year
to be affected by the economic slowdown, will take measures to
maintain prices and minimise passing on adjustments to consumers.
	   Its chairman Datuk Borhan Kuntom says in his annual statement
that the group will strive to become more resilient amid the
downturn.
	   He adds that the group is actively sourcing alternative raw
materials and packaging materials ``to uphold our position in the
Malaysian food and beverage industry''.
	   It is also assessing the use of alternative currencies to reduce
foreign exchange losses.
	   For last year, Borhan notes that despite the need to provide for
foreign exchange losses and the higher costs of materials,
promotional expenses and intense competition, the group recorded a
pre-tax profit of RM30.15 million from RM34.61 million the previous
year.
	   Group turnover was RM493.25 million, about 4.5 per cent higher
from RM471.85 million previously.
	   Borhan says the group's overall cash flow position last year
improved, compared with the 1996 financial year.
	   A final dividend of 9 per cent was declared last year.
	   The performance of associate companies also improved compared
with the previous year, the chairman adds.

	   WESTERNERS have always been fascinated by the mystical Chinese
art of ``feng shui''.
	   They marvel in disbelief that ``feng shui'' has been practised
by millions of Chinese all over the world, and that it works!
Recently, I gave a talk on ``feng shui'' at a luncheon to about
1,000 Australians at the Sunway Lagoon Resort Hotel in Bandar
Sunway.
	   The talk was for the Housing Industry Association of Australia
(HIA) as well as the Housing Developers' Association of Malaysia
(HDAM).
	   Before the talk, I had the opportunity to talk to some chief
executive officers (CEO) from Australia about ``feng shui''.
	   They were fascinated and were looking forward to learn more
about this mystical subject.
	   I was also told that interest in the art of ``feng shui'' is
gaining momentum in Australia.
	   After the talk, I was approached by some CEOs who had been
reading a lot about the subject and wanted to clarify and
understand more of its finer points.
	   They shared the same notion that ``feng shui'' can provide an
edge over competitors amid the economic turmoil in the region.
	   To my surprise, even though they did not know much about the
subject, they had a positive outlook and were able to accept it as
their latest ``insurance'' coverage in a very competitive business
environment.
	   Amid the economic turmoil in the region, more and more corporate
players have engaged me to check the ``feng shui'' aspect of their
homes and offices to enhance and to maintain their overall fortune
and wealth.
	   One ``Datuk'' recently told me it is important that ``feng
shui'' helps him to be more sober and to maintain a positive
outlook, especially in decisions relating to his business.
	   Very importantly, it will enhance his overall confidence despite
the many setbacks the country is facing at the moment.
	   It is also important to note that the environment we live and
work in must be in harmony with the person to enhance his overall
good fortune.

At least 70 dead in high-speed German train crash that train derailed, hit bridge, sent car plunging. 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: UPDATES with new information from police on cause of crash,
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 70 people and
seriously injuring 200 as car after car of the train crumpled into
the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear. Police spokesman
Joachim Lindenberg said it appeared that the impact of the train
collapsed the overpass, sending an auto parked on the structure
plunging to the tracks.
	   The auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the
tracks, Lindenberg told German television ARD. He said that anyone
that close to the accident could not have survived. Deutsche Bahn
did not immediately confirm that account.
	   Earlier reports, based on witness accounts to authorities,
suggested that the auto had plunged into the train causing it to
derail.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while
the cars derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   At least 13 cars derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed the
cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. Survivors were taken to
hospitals throughout the region. The Red Cross had chartered six
buses to take most of the uninjured to Hamburg, spokesman Harald
Krueger said.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991.
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 800 rescue workers were at the scene, including trauma
surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free passengers
trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Christian Krettek, of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN
that rescue workers expected the death toll to rise, and it was
still unclear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

	   ASIAN stock markets, especially those of Singapore, Malaysia and
Hong Kong, accounted for the three weakest performers among
regional indices with all feeling the ripple effects from the
Indonesian crisis and the drying up of liquidity.
	   It was another poor month for Malaysian stocks, culminating with
a larger-than-expected loss posted by national airline Malaysian
Airline System Bhd due to heavy foreign exchange losses and decline
in regional travel.
	   The local bourse lost 17.8 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI)'s latest indices used to measure the
performance of international securities.
	   Comprising over 2,600 securities in 23 developed markets and
1,600 securities in 28 emerging markets, the MSCI database reflects
about 80 per cent of the world's equity market capitalisation.
	   In Singapore, the weak Japanese yen and Wall Street's downturn
contributed to a negative investment environment, with the property
sector especially hit hard by fears of a possible upcoming
recession, said MSCI.
	   The island republic's stock market lost 19.0 per cent in the
MSCI index.
	   Hong Kong's bourse was down 14 per cent amid a 2 per cent drop
in its gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year, the
first economic contraction in 13 years, said MSCI.
	   With unemployment rate at a historic high and falling property
prices, stocks have followed their regional counterparts in a
downward spiral.
	   Troubles in Asia took place while most European developed
markets continued to advance in May.
	   The top performing developed markets were Germany (up 7.1 per
cent), Belgium (up 5.9 per cent), and Austria (up 5.5 per cent).
	   German and Belgium stocks gained on speculation of merger
activities, while positive analyst comments on Austria's
under-valuation relative to other European countries prompted
several key shares to rise.
	   All three countries are confirmed members of the European
Monetary Union.
	   The Russian stock market was the worst MSCI country performance
in May, with economic and political problems combined to drag local
stocks down 39.4 per cent.
	   Pakistan's bourse was down 37.9 per cent as its nuclear tests
brought the country's financial markets to a standstill as
investors await the outcome of threatened foreign economic
sanctions.

	   PORT DICKSON, Mon. - Kelantan Umno will hold an election dry-run
in August to check its machinery for the general election, State
deputy liaison chief Datuk Annuar Musa said today.
	   He said it would enable the party to gear itself for a general
election scheduled in two years.
	   Annuar, who is Rural Development Minister, said Kelantan Umno
was conducting 220 workshops for some 8,000 election workers before
embarking on a voter registration exercise next month.
	   Speaking after visiting a development programme for the very
poor in Kuala Lukut here, he said the early preparation was
necessary as Kelantan Umno was determined to wrest the State Pas.
	   ``We have been organising weekly meetings of the liaison
committee as well as monthly ceramah as we are very serious about
getting back Kelantan from the opposition,'' he added.
	   On Kelantan Umno's call for the resignation of Menteri Besar
Datuk Nik Aziz Nik Mat, he said the State had not progressed under
his leadership.
	   He said Pas should replace Nik Aziz with Datuk Abdul Halim Abdul
Rahman, the Deputy Menteri Besar, whom Umno believed could govern
Kelantan better.
	   ``Nik Aziz can instead concentrate on his role as head of the
Pas consultative committee,'' he added.
	   Annuar also said Kelantan Umno would submit a 10-point action
plan passed during a three-day convention to Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is Umno president and Kelantan Umno
liaison chief, on June 10 at the Prime Minister's Department.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A lot will happen at the biggest ever World Cup,
but Just Fontaine need not worry, just yet.
	   Despite Ronaldo, Batistuta, Shearer and a slew of other prolific
strikers, it is unlikely his record of 13 goals in one World Cup
tournament will fall.
	   Forty years after setting the record at the 1958 World Cup in
Sweden, Fontaine is a star all over again.
	   ``I'd better enjoy it, because the next time it's in France,
I'll be in my coffin,'' the 64-year-old Frenchman said.
	   No one has come close since, and the top-scoring title is now
regularly going to a striker who gets a half dozen goals.
	   And to think Fontaine wasn't even considered the best French
forward going into the 1958 tournament, where France lost to
eventual champion Brazil in the semifinals. He even scored them all
with a pair of soccer boots on loan because his shoes fell apart
days ahead of the finals.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne wasn't the only drunken England
soccer player the night before coach Glenn Hoddle announced he was
dropping the controversial midfielder from the World Cup team.
	   England's No. 1 goalkeeper David Seaman said ``quite a few''
other England internationals were also drunk at a team party at
their training base in southern Spain.
	   Hoddle cut the 31-year-old midfielder Sunday because he said he
was out of shape, setting off a controversy about whether one of
England's best midfielders should have made the team.
	   Gascoigne later admitted he was drunk at the party and then said
he was drinking beer during a golf game Sunday just hours before
Hoddle gave him the bad news.
	   ___  
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss FIFA presidential hopeful Sepp
Blatter had conciliatory words for his Swedish rival Lennart
Johansson in a magazine interview published Wednesday.
	   ``Personally I have no problem with him, but people around him
are putting him under pressure,'' FIFA general secretary Blatter
was quoted as saying in the Swiss weekly Schweizer Illustrierte.
	   That pressure was leading UEFA President Johansson, the only
other candidate to take over the presidency of world soccer's
governing body, to say things that ``have nothing to do with fair
play,'' he continued.
	   The 198-member FIFA Congress, meeting Monday in Paris, will
choose a successor to Joao Havelange, the Brazilian who has
directed the sport through 24 years of unprecedented commercial
success.
	   The election brings to an end a bitter battle between the two
rivals.
	   ___  
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's
second-half goal gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over fellow World
Cup qualifier Japan in an evenly balanced friendly match Wednesday.
	   Hidetoshi Nakata of Bellmare Hiratsuka missed two good chances
for Japan before Sinisa, who plays for Italian club Sampdoria,
scored for Yugoslavia in the 71st minute.
	   It was Japan's final warm-up match against another national
side. Yugoslavia plays non-qualifier Switzerland in Basel Saturday.
	   ___  
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The French team is premiering the
Cryo'One at the World Cup, a gun that sprays a freezing gas on a
player's injury.
	   It looks like it's right out of Star Trek, but apparently it
works.
	   ``It gets them healed a lot quicker. They're back in 48 hours,''
said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   Some teams still swear by the trusty sponge, others use gas
canisters, but the Cryo'One is by far the most sophisticated devise
so far.
	   ``It's medical science of the modern era,'' said Jacquet.
	   It doesn't take care of serious injuries, but it should soothe
any hard knocks and have a player back in no time, the French team
hopes. France is the only one of the 32 teams using the device.
	   ___  
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ FIFA presidential hopeful Joseph
Blatter took to the campaign trail in battle-scarred Liberia,
repeating his pledge to award the 2006 World Cup to an African
country.
	   Blatter, who met with local soccer officials and Liberian star
George Weah, also promised to increase funding to sport programs in
this West African country which in 1996 emerged from seven years of
civil war.
	   Blatter, who is currently FIFA secretary general, was invited to
Liberia by Weah, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters.
	   ``I will not give you all of my programs for Africa right
here,'' Blatter said. ``What I can promise is that if elected
president of FIFA on June 8, I will give the 2006 World Cup to
Africa.''

Del Piero makes it but Boksic is out AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero is on Italy's squad but Alen
Boksic of Croatia won't play his country's first World Cup.
	   Del Piero's thigh injury has repaired enough for him to join
Italy's bid to score a record-tying fourth triumph. But Boksic, his
former Juventus colleague, won't be in the lineup because he needs
knee surgery.
	   When World Cup organizers announced the rosters for the June
10-July 12 championship, there was relief around the Italian camp
and dismay among the Croatians.
	   Del Piero suffered an injury to his right thigh during La Juve's
loss to Real Madrid in the European Champions Cup final against
Real Madrid two weeks ago.
	   When Italian coach Cesare Maldini announced his provisional
squad, Del Piero's name wasn't on it. But Maldini kept a place free
and the nation's soccer fans, who know how important the star is to
the team's chances of winning the trophy, had an anxious wait while
Del Piero proved his fitness.
	   ``It's true I feel good, but on a scale from 1 to 10, right now
I am at 5,'' Del Piero told reporters Wednesday at Italy's training
headquarters.
	   ``It is clear that to play I have to be in good form. I don't
want to take risks. There is no room for false steps,'' the striker
said. ``The World Cup is long; it certainly does not end with the
(first) game against Chile.
	   ``The healing process is going well. It's all going according to
plan,'' said Del Piero, 23. ``But I can't say any more than that.
We'll wait until the work intensifies and we will see how I hold
up.''
	   While Del Piero is getting there, Boksic will take no part in
his country's first ever World Cup.
	   The Croatians, who have a good chance of making it to the second
round along with Group H favorite Argentina against debutants Japan
and Jamaica, will have to do without their lanky striker. Boksic
helped Juventus win the Italian league title in the 1996-97 season
and contributed to Lazio's triumph in the Italian Cup in the season
just ended.
	   Described by Lazio coach Sven Goran Eriksson as
``irreplaceable,'' Boksic twisted his knee in a Serie A game April
26 and hasn't played since.
	   The Croatians will make do with Real Madrid star Davor Suker and
Goran Vlaovic of Valencia, backed up from midfield by AC Milan's
Zvonimir Boban and Robert Prosinecki, who has returned from Spanish
soccer to play for Croatia Zagreb.
	   Boksic joins some big names on the World Cup sidelines.
	   Romario, whose goals helped Brazil to a record fourth title four
years ago, wept as he announced Tuesday he had not recovered from a
calf muscle injury. England will be without 1990 star Paul
Gascoigne, who was not considered fit enough for a gruelling
championship like the World Cup and was dropped from the squad.
	   Italy lost its first-choice goalkeeper, Angelo Peruzzi, who
suffered a calf injury in a training accident on Sunday and was
told he would be sidelined for a month.

Apartheid killer turns on former master at Botha trial 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: (AMS) RECASTS, ADDS fresh Tutu testimony

By PAUL HARRIS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Police death squad commander Eugene
de Kock killed and maimed for years to defend apartheid, leaving a
trail of misery that earned him a 212 year jail sentence.
	   But on Wednesday he turned on white-run South Africa's last
hardline president P. W. Botha, branding him a coward who sold out
the men who did apartheid's dirty work.
	   Testifying in Botha's trial for ignoring a summons by a panel
probing apartheid era crimes, de Kock was asked by state prosecutor
Bruce Morrison how it felt to be in jail while top politicians and
generals remained free.
	   ``They want to eat lamb but they don't want to see the blood and
the guts,'' said de Kock, whose ruthlessness earned him the
nickname Prime Evil. ``They are cowards. They will remain that.''
	   Botha has refused to testify in person before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, submitting instead thousands of pages in
answer to written questions. He also ignored pleas last year by
panel chairman Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu that he and other
apartheid era leaders should apply for amnesty from the commission.
	   But this week he is being confronted with evidence of his
complicity in atrocities.
	   The commission has submitted dozens of documents suggesting the
State Security Council, which Botha headed, sanctioned killing
black liberation fighters.
	   Wearing a blue pullover and jeans, de Kock said he never doubted
his killing spree was approved by the highest echelons of the
state.
	   Minutes from SSC meetings that described how opponents should be
``neutralized'' or ``eliminated'' have been submitted as evidence.
Botha and other top government officials claim they meant people
should be detained.
	   Speaking softly but firmly, de Kock said he interpreted the
words more harshly.
	   ``In the terminology that they used it means killing,'' he said,
peering at the packed courtroom through thick-lensed rectangular
spectacles.
	   Botha, 82, wearing a grey business suit, looked on impassively.
	   De Kock commanded the Vlakplaas police unit that assassinated
black anti-apartheid activists.
	   Tutu also took the stand on Wednesday, saying it pained him to
appear in court and adding that it was not too late for Botha to
halt the court case.
	   ``I tried to reach out to Mr. Botha. I reached out to him out of
deep compassion,'' said the retired Anglican Archbishop. ``Even now
I hope reason will prevail.''
	   However, Tutu attacked Botha and other apartheid leaders for
covering up crimes during their rule.
	   ``I told our people, `Don't worry. A lie such as this thing will
not prevail forever','' he said.``I have been vindicated in the
most spectacular way.''
	   Much of the trial has focused on the 1988 bombing of Khotso
House, the Johannesburg headquarters of an anti-apartheid group. A
former head of South Africa's police has said Botha ordered the
bombing and de Kock carried it out.
	   Botha denies he ordered the bombing.
	   Botha's defense team declined to cross-examine two witnesses to
the bombing.
	   The trial is being held in the southern coastal city of George,
near Botha's retirement home. He faces up to two years in prison
and unspecified fines if convicted.
	   Apartheid ended after Botha's successor, President F.W. de
Klerk, negotiated with the African National Congress for the first
all-race elections in 1994. The ANC won the election.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A bomb exploded on a commuter train
Wednesday, killing one passenger and injuring at least three
others, news reports said.
	   The bomb exploded near the central Yesilkoy station at the start
of the city's rush hour, the private NTV television said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Kurdish rebels, leftist urban guerrillas and radical Islamic
groups are known to be active in the city.

U.S. ambassador urges Ukraine to push ahead with economic reforms 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Steven Pifer urged Ukraine
on Wednesday to push ahead with economic reforms, saying the
country faced a fierce battle with the rest of the world for
foreign investment and had no time to lose.
	   ``Time is growing short, and fundamental reforms are needed to
gain market confidence,'' Pifer told a business development forum
in Kiev.
	   Resource-rich Ukraine, the third-largest recipient of American
aid, has been relatively slow in implementing economic reforms.
	   The country of more than 50 million people has attracted only
dlrs 2 billion in direct foreign investment since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. It has resorted to heavy foreign borrowing and is
struggling to meet the terms for a major International Monetary
Fund loan.
	   Pifer noted such achievements as Ukraine's democratic transition
of power, growing links with the West, stable currency and
successful fight against hyperinflation.
	   But ``the years since Ukraine regained its independence have
also been years of disappointment, of decline and stagnation, of
unrealized potential, particularly in the economic field,'' Pifer
said.
	   ``People are starting to associate democracy, freedom and a
market economy with poverty and corruption.''
	   Pifer said business and investment were stifled by Ukraine's
``complex, confusing and high taxes,'' over-regulation, arbitrary
decisions by mid-level officials and inability to enforce
contracts.
	   ``The message to the foreign investor all too often is that he
should go elsewhere,'' he said.
	   The ambassador warned that Ukraine is facing a ``fierce and
immediate ... competition with the entire world'' for the
investment dollar.
	   ``The sad fact is that Ukraine is losing this competition, and
losing badly,'' Pifer said.
	   Pifer said Ukraine needed to adopt and enforce business laws,
tackle widespread corruption, support small- and medium-sized
enterprises, pursue de-regulation, slash its heavy foreign
borrowing, and implement fundamental reforms in the huge energy and
the potentially rich agricultural sectors.
	   The ambassador also urged Ukraine's new, leftist-dominated
parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, to set aside political infighting
and differences with President Leonid Kuchma and ``support a
program that serves Ukraine's future.''
	   ``Ukraine must help itself by pressing ahead with reform,''
Pifer said. ``The international community stands ready to help.
There is little time to lose.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders pleaded with
Western officials Wednesday for military intervention to halt what
they said is a deliberate Serb strategy of forced expulsions from
Kosovo, as more refugees poured over the border to Albania.
	   The request came with no sign of a letup in the Serbs' offensive
aimed at smashing resistance to their authority in the secessionist
province of southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
10-to-1.
	   According to Albanian sources, Serb forces shelled at least five
villages Wednesday in an area of western Kosovo near the Albanian
border, sending more residents fleeing. Houses were set ablaze in
the attack by Serb police and paramilitary units, backed by
Yugoslav army tanks.
	   New casualty reports from the sealed-off area were not
available. Dozens are believed dead since the start of a stepped-up
campaign last week by the Serbs, who want to wipe out the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. At least 80 people were
killed in a similar crackdown in March, and well over 200 people
have died this year in clashes.
	   Top aides to Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Albanians'
self-described independent government, met with a European
delegation in Kosovo's capital Pristina on Wednesday. They told the
officials that ``ethnic cleansing and massacres carried out by Serb
forces in western Kosovo are a part of a planned-out scheme of
ethnic cleansing throughout the province.''
	   The situation is dramatic and NATO must intervene, they told the
delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, headed by Javier Ruperez. They said world powers also must
pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is determined
to keep Kosovo from breaking away from Serbia, one of two remaining
republics in Yugoslavia.
	   ``Unless there is significant international pressure on
Belgrade, chances for a peaceful solution to the crisis will be
lost forever,'' Alush Gashi said.
	   But NATO allies, with 34,000 troops already in neighboring
Bosnia, are reluctant to commit another big contingent to the
Balkans.
	   Meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, they agreed to consider again
whether to deploy combat troops to Albania and Macedonia on
Kosovo's borders, but indicated a decision is not imminent.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed until we have solid,
well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO official who asked
not to be named.
	   Ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations did agree to accelerate other
measures, including technical and military assistance for Albania
and Macedonia.
	   Besides thousands of displaced Kosovo residents who have sought
shelter in border highlands, several thousand others have streamed
over the border into Albania.
	   OSCE spokesman Bill Foxton confirmed at the Albanian border that
at least two refugees had died as a result of the arduous trek over
the mountains _ a 60-year-old man of a heart attack and a
4-year-old girl who died when her mother, who was carrying her,
slipped and fell on a rocky path.
	   International monitors near the border said houses could be seen
in flames in the besieged village of Junik, and Konoshevac was
being shelled. Both are in Kosovo's targeted Decani region.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
2,000 refugees crossed overnight into Albania, bringing the total
to some 3,700 since the Serb assault was launched late last week.
	   Most are women, children and elderly who are ``exhausted
mentally and physically,'' spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   Albania's state-run ATA news agency said about 3,000 more
refugees were approaching the border.
	   Local authorities in northeastern Albania, site of most of the
crossings, said that with more refugees arriving by the hour, the
25 tons of aid sent Tuesday by the U.N. refugee agency was
inadequate.
	   In a report documenting growing reluctance to die for Kosovo,
the daily Telegraf, published in Belgrade, reported that about 100
policemen had been fired for refusing to go fight in the province.

Opposition group claims three attacks, at least three killed spokesman in Baghdad; no pickup

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An outlawed Iranian opposition group claimed
responsibility Wednesday for a bomb and two mortar attacks on
government buildings that killed at least three people.
	   In the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, a spokesman for the opposition
group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, warned of more attacks.
	   ``Our units inside Iran will escalate attacks against the
regime,'' Mohammad Mohaddessin told The Associated Press.
	   In the first high-level response to the attacks, parliamentary
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said Wednesday that Iran's enemies
were seeking to exploit apparent differences among Iran's top
leadership.
	   ``Unity of expression is essential for revolutionary forces ...
(who) must stand against those who want to fish in muddy waters,''
said Nateq-Nouri, a leading hard-liner in the government who is
known to be opposed to the moderates led by President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   A bomb exploded Tuesday at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office
in Tehran. Official sources, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said at least three people were killed and two injured.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency denied the bombing was
the work of the Mujahedeen, but Tehran's Governor General Mohammad
Reza Ayatollahi was reported by state-run television Wednesday as
saying the opposition group was behind the attack.
	   In a statement Wednesday, the Mujahedeen said it carried out the
bombing as well as two mortar attacks Tuesday on the Central
Command Headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and
the Defense Industries Organization in the capital.
	   The Mujahedeen statement said the three attacks were in
retaliation for the killing of its members by the Iranian
government in recent months.
	   ``In the surprise attack, several Revolutionary Guards were
killed or wounded and the headquarters' buildings were damaged,''
the group said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
	   It did not claim any casualties for the attack on the defense
industries building.
	   However, Iranian radio said security men foiled an attempted
attack by ``saboteurs'' at the Revolutionary Guards headquarters
Tuesday and the perpetrators fled.
	   Official media did not speak of an attack on a Defense
Industries building, but they did report a bomb explosion at an
unidentified government building in northern Tehran late Tuesday.
It was not known if this property belonged to Defense Industries.
	   There was no report of casualties in this bombing.
	   The Iranian newspaper Farda had reported Tuesday that 50
Mujahedeen fighters had sneaked into Iran across the largely
unguarded border with Afghanistan.
	   In Baghdad, Mohaddessin said the Mujahedeen military camps in
Iraq, close to the Iranian border, were on alert for expected
reprisals from the Tehran government.
	   Also Wednesday, police evacuated guests and staff at the
Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran following a bomb threat made by a
caller, sources said. No bomb was found at the hotel, which is
close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   A police officer at the prosecutor's office said a bomb in a
briefcase caused the explosion. However, the official news agency
said the explosion was caused by explosives which went off
accidentally as they were being brought into the building as
evidence for a case.
	   Newspapers published higher casualty tolls than given by
officials. Three government-controlled newspapers said five people
were killed, and one added that another nine people were injured.

Russian government prepares to tackle 2000 computer Problem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ordered its computer
experts to develop ways to resolve the so-called Year 2000 problem,
a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Government technicians have three months to analyze their
systems and determine how much software needs to be changed, and
what hardware, if any, needs to be replaced, Interfax said.
	   The Year 2000 problem, arises because many computers, originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year, may be
unable to distinguish between the years 2000 and 1900 because their
codes represent those years as simply 00.
	   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.

Tonkov edges overall leader Pantani at end of tough climb 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes.
<TEXT>
	   ALPE DI PAMPEAGO, Italy (AP) _ Pavel Tonkov edged overall leader
Marco Pantani by one second Wednesday to claim the 18th stage of
the Tour of Italy after the race's top two riders made a late
breakaway on the final climb in the Alps.
	   The tough, 115-kilometer (71.3-mile) stage ended at an altitude
of 1,760 meters (5,808 feet) above sea level.
	   Pantani finished second for the second straight stage, and held
onto the pink jersey heading into the last four days. The Italian
leads Tonkov, the 1996 Giro champion and runner-up last year, by 27
seconds in the overall standings.
	   ``I'm not made of steel. I'll give my all again tomorrow, but my
adversaries are strong,'' Tonkov said. ``Marco Pantani was in
brilliant shape. He pedaled strongly going uphill.''
	   Favorite Alex Zuelle, who had dominated the cycling classic
until it headed into the mountains, lost more time Wednesday. He
faltered on the final uphill pass and was fourth, 58 seconds behind
Russia's Tonkov. Nicola Miceli was third Wednesday.
	   Zuelle now trails Pantani by more than two minutes overall.
	   Colombia's Chepe Gonzales rode alone at the lead for more than
40 kilometers (25 miles), but was eventually caught by a pack of 22
riders heading into the final climb.
	   Zuelle tried to take off ahead of the leaders but was reeled in,
setting the stage for Tonkov and Pantani to break away with 4
kilometers (2.5 miles) left.
	   Tonkov was clocked in 3 hours, 36 minutes, 54 seconds.
	   Nicola Miceli was third, 44 seconds off the pace.
	   Pantani, sidelined for the entire 1996 season with a broken leg,
vaulted from fourth to first place Tuesday.
	   The 22-stage race ends Sunday in Milan.
	   ``If I want to reach Milan with the pink jersey, I need to gain
some minutes, but it won't be easy,'' said Pantani, who rides for
the Mercatone Uno team.
	   ``We'll have to see what happens tomorrow. I think the man in
the best condition will emerge victorious. Tonkov looked in good
form.''
	   Thursday's 19th stage is the toughest of the race, with grueling
climbing during the 239 kilometers (148 miles) from Cavalese to
Plan di Montecampione.

Turkish premier to resign by year's end; elections in April 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Wednesday
he would resign at the end of the year to pave the way for early
elections in April.
	   The announcement came after a meeting with Deniz Baykal, the
leader of the Social Democratic Republican People's Party, CHP.
Baykal has been pushing for early elections in return for his
party's continued support to Yilmaz's minority government.
	   Yilmaz said April 18 was a likely date for the elections.
	   ``A caretaker government will be formed to take us to the
elections,'' Yilmaz said, adding that he would discuss with
President Suleyman Demirel the composition of the new government.
	   Yilmaz's fragile coalition relies heavily on the support in
Parliament of the 56 CHP deputies.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year in a coalition of three parties
-- his center-right Motherland Party, the Democratic Left Party and
the Democratic Turkey Party -- after the military forced the
previous, Islamic-led government out of power.

Palestinian says `traitor' Jerusalem patriarch's life in danger 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Describing the Orthodox Christian
Patriarch of Jerusalem as a ``traitor'' whose life is in danger, a
former Palestinian official on Wednesday demanded the cleric's
expulsion.
	   ``The law, whether it is in Jordan or in Palestine, is to
execute a traitor who sells Palestinian lands to Israelis or
foreigners,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif.
	   Sharif, a former high-ranking adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, claimed Patriarch Diodoros of Jerusalem had betrayed
Palestinians by selling church-owned land to Israelis and
foreigners.
	   But the Palestinian Authority said Abu Sharif did not represent
them, that his statements came as a surprise, and that they were
his own.
	   ``We have no knowledge of any threats to the life of the
patriarch, and would not like to hear that there are any such
threats,'' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the secretary of the
Palestinian Cabinet and an Arafat aide.
	   Abu Sharif warned that ``no one can guarantee that he will be
alive,'' and said Palestinian officials already had petitioned
Greece to remove Diodoros and replace him with a Palestinian.
	   In Athens, Palestinian consul Ismat Sabri denied such a request
had been made.
	   Although he is Greek, Diodoros was elected by local clergy and
Greece has no say in his selection.
	   Abu Sharif, who still presents himself as an Arafat adviser,
made his remarks during a news conference in Athens to present a
book by another Palestinian author.
	   At issue are land sales in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east
Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and
claimed by the Palestinians for a future state. The Palestinian
Authority says those selling land to the Jews undermine efforts to
establish a Palestinian state.
	   In Jerusalem, patriarchate spokesman Father Timothy denied any
land was sold and said ``we have excellent relations with Yasser
Arafat ... so what he says contradicts reality.''
	   Abu Sharif claimed the patriarch sold a piece of land in Jaffa
to Israelis for dlrs 22 million. He also said the patriarch was
negotiating to sell a piece of land between Bethlehem and
Jerusalem, adjacent to a controversial Jewish housing project in
East Jerusalem.
	   The housing project, referred to in Hebrew as Har Homa, is to go
up in the sector claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
In Arabic, the area is known as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Father Timothy said the Jaffa land was leased to a Canadian
company and the parcel near Jerusalem was a ``holy place, the well
of the Virgin Mary'' which the patriarchate was going to develop.

Leaders from Liberia, Sierra Leone to discuss ties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Guinea has offered to host talks
between feuding neighbors Sierra Leone and Liberia in a bid to
rejuvenate deteriorating ties between the troubled West African
countries.
	   Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah welcomed the offer
from Guinea's Foreign Ministry for the one-day summit with
Liberia's President Charles Taylor, state-controlled radio reported
Wednesday.
	   The summit in Guinea's capital of Conakry is scheduled for
Thursday, although Taylor has not publicly announced whether he
plans to attend.
	   ``The Conakry meeting will provide the opportunity for (Kabbah
and Taylor) to hold fruitful discussions on the deteriorating
relationship between Sierra Leone and Liberia,'' the broadcast
said.
	   The summit will also be used to discuss efforts to revive the
Mano River Union, a sub-regional trade bloc of Sierra Leone,
Liberia and Guinea.
	   Squabbling between Liberia and Sierra Leone _ West African
neighbors along the Atlantic coastline _ has been on the rise in
recent months, with both sides accusing the other of offering safe
haven to rebel factions.
	   Kabbah's government was restored to power earlier this year
after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma's ruling military junta was
ousted by a West African coalition army.
	   Some reports have claimed Koroma sought refuge in Taylor's
Liberia.
	   Liberia, meanwhile, called this week for United Nations and West
African peacekeeping troops to be deployed on its volatile
northwestern border with Sierra Leone.
	   Information Minister Joe Mulbah said a peacekeeping force was
necessary to prevent fighting in Sierra Leone from spreading across
the border.

Israel: Mastermind of Achille Lauro hijacking no security threat 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A former PLO guerrilla chief who mastermined
the 1985 murder of an American Jew during the Achille Lauro cruise
ship hijacking does not pose a threat to Israeli security, the
attorney general ruled Wednesday.
	   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein wrote that Israel doesn't
plan to seek the arrest of Mohammed Abbas, who is currently
visiting in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.
	   Rubinstein responded to a petition by two Israelis and Dov
Hikind, a New York State Assemblyman from Brooklyn, who have asked
the Supreme Court to order the Israel to arrest and try Abbas for
murder. The court has not said when it would issue a decision.
	   In a statement to the court on, Rubinstein said Abbas ``does not
pose a security threat'' and that an arrest ``would probably cause
real friction with the Palestinian side.''
	   Guerrillas acting on Abbas' orders seized the Italian cruise
ship off Egypt in 1985. They shot an elderly American passenger in
a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, and threw his body overboard.
	   The hijackers surrendered to Egyptian authorities, who put Abbas
and his men on a flight for Tunisia, where the PLO was
headquartered at the time. But the U.S. Navy forced the flight down
in Italy and the Italian authorities allowed Abbas to flee.
	   An Italian court later convicted Abbas and two other PLO
guerrillas in absentia and sentenced them to life in prison.
	   In 1996, Israel allowed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, to
return to the Gaza Strip to attend a session of the Palestine
National Council. Since then he has returned to Gaza three times
and has described the current stay as an extended one.
	   Under a 1993 peace agreement with the Palestinians, Israel
allowed thousands of PLO guerrillas to return from abroad and enter
the new autonomous Palestinian areas. Rubinstein wrote that ``it
would not be reasonable to prosecute (Abbas) for acts which he
committed before Sept. 13 1993.''

Missing uranium causes upset, but plant says it's a mere technicality 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS reax from Prime Minister Blair in grafs 8-9
<TEXT>
	   DOUNREAY, Scotland (AP) _ Reports that enough uranium to make a
half-dozen nuclear warheads is missing from Britain's Dounreay
processing plant provoked outrage Wednesday, but authorities said
it was a mere technicality and that the material was never there.
	   The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority confirmed that an
internal inquiry listed 170 kilograms (374 pounds) of uranium as
missing, mostly from processing work in the mid-1960s. But it said
that was due to a 1 percent overestimate in the amount of material
that went into the plant then.
	   ``The question that you could have 170 kilograms still inside
the processing plant is absolutely preposterous. The plant simply
couldn't continue to operate. It would be detectable,'' the
authority's chief executive, John McEwan, said in a BBC radio
interview.
	   The controversy, which prompted demands for a judicial inquiry,
was only the latest at the plant in northern Scotland.
	   In April, Dounreay attracted international attention when 4.3
kilograms (9.46 pounds) of highly enriched uranium and 0.8
kilograms (1.76 pounds) of spent nuclear fuel were shipped there
from Georgia, a restive former Soviet republic. Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Britain accepted the shipment to prevent the threat of
nuclear proliferation
	   The Scottish National Party, which has long demanded that
Britain scrap nuclear weapons unilaterally and opposes Dounreay in
principle, urged a South African-style truth commission to examine
the matter of the missing uranium, with staff past and present
exempted from official secrecy rules.
	   ``We are now in the ludicrous situation where we are hoping that
the uranium was used to make British atom bombs because the
alternatives are even harder to stomach,'' party spokeswoman
Roseanna Cunningham said.
	   Blair accused the Scottish Nationalists of being ``irresponsible
and extreme.''
	   ``There is absolutely no evidence whatever to back up the
suggestion ... that any material has been stolen or fallen into
terrorist or foreign government hands,'' Blair said in the House of
Commons. ``No such material has ever been sent from Dounreay for
use for UK weapons purposes.''

Former minister files new complaint against newspaper 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A former interior minister has filed a
complaint about reports in an opposition newspaper he successfully
sued for libel, a move that could lead to another in a string of
suits against the paper.
	   Hassan el-Alfy claimed the Islamic-oriented Al-Shaab newspaper
``maliciously'' reported the trial of the libel case last year in a
bid to influence the judges, officials at the prosecutor general's
office said Wednesday.
	   According to Egyptian, law his complaint to the prosecutor
general must be investigated and could result in another libel
suit. It would be the fourth against Al-Shaab journalists by
el-Alfy.
	   El-Alfy resigned after he was severely criticized by President
Hosni Mubarak over last November's massacre of 58 tourists in the
southern city of Luxor by Islamic militants.
	   The officials, who spoke under customary rules of anonymity,
said the former minister named chief editor Magdi Hussein, nine
al-Shaab reporters and the head of Al-Shaab's board of directors in
his complaint.
	   Hussein is already serving a one-year jail sentence after being
found guilty of defaming el-Alfy. The case stemmed from nearly 80
articles that his biweekly newspaper published alleging el-Alfy's
family had amassed wealth by using his position.
	   The editor is scheduled to appear in court Saturday in another
libel suit that el-Alfy filed. Hearings have is yet to begin on a
third libel case against Hussein and two journalists of al-Shaab.
	   Human rights groups in Egypt and abroad have condemned the
jailing of reporters in libel cases _ four are now in jail _ as a
setback for the press in Egypt.

Bosnian Serb and Muslim-Croat police sign agreement to cooperate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ For the first time since
war ended, police in the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat
Federation _ the two halves of Bosnia _ signed Wednesday an accord
to fight crime together.
	   The protocol, signed by the Bosnian Serb interior minister and
his federation counterpart, envisages ``cooperation in providing
legal security for all citizens ... preventing infringements of
freedom of movement and civil rights.''
	   Elizabeth Rehn, the U.N. envoy for Bosnia, witnessed the signing
in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka.
	   The two Bosnian interior ministries agreed to cooperate in
fighting crime, terrorism, exchange data and information to this
end and have regular meetings in both substates.
	   Mehmet Zilic, the federation minister, said the protocol was ``a
great step forward in professional cooperation between the two
police forces.
	   ``We will try to come to agreements faster, because they
(criminals) are known to work fast and the whole area of Bosnia
cannot be separated in terms of security,'' Zilic said.
	   Similarly, Milovan Stankovic, his Bosnian Serb counterpart, said
the two police forces would work together to break up crime
syndicates across the whole country.
	   However, he indicated that would not involve hunting down war
crimes suspects wanted by the international war crimes tribunal in
The Hague.
	   He said that matter was ``up to judicial and court systems in
Bosnia and that police would, in that sense, act as an executive
body.''

	   SHARI BASURKH, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's deposed
President Burhanuddin Rabbani says the international response to
the deadly earthquake was too slow, as survivors in some of the
remotest regions still waited Wednesday for help to arrive.
	   Rabbani arrived by helicopter in Shari-Basurkh _ one of the
hardest hit areas _ on Sunday to see the devastation wreaked by
Saturday's 6.9 quake and to settle a dispute between feuding
commanders.
	   The northern-based alliance established to stop the Taliban
religious army from consolidating its hold on Afghanistan has been
fraught with internal disputes. Several of them have turned
violent.
	   The feuding comes as residents of the area were trying to dig
themselves out from beneath the rubble caused by the deadly quake
that killed as many as 5,000 people, wiped out entire villages and
left as many as 60,000 people homeless.
	   The U.N. and the Red Cross have been coordinating their relief
efforts attempting to make several many helicopter runs a day from
Faisabad to remote villages to pick up the wounded, drop off
blankets, plastic sheeting and tents.
	   ``We are trying to get in more helicopters ... this is where the
bottleneck has been,'' said Philip Spoerri, a Red Cross spokesman
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   Until now he said the priority has been to get the wounded out
and medical supplies to the hardest hit areas and it hasn't been
easy. He said 3.5 tons of medical supplies were to be sent to
Faisabad from Pakistan today.
	   Much of the area is inaccessible by road.
	   In Shari Basurkh, near the epicenter, half the village was
flattened by the violent shaking. The quake struck during the late
morning when most of the men were in the fields, which is why aid
workers say the bulk of the wounded are women, old men and children
_ all of whom had been in their homes at the time of the trembler.
	   In a makeshift clinic set up in an elementary school, a baby on
an intravenous drip lay screaming next to a woman whose face was
covered by yellow bruises.
	   Most people here had not eaten since the earthquake hit, Most of
the injured _ fearing aftershocks _ wanted to stay outside. Some
slept on bare ground.
	   ``They really worry about the future ... because they don't have
any shelter, any food, I think they have a very bad future,'' said
Abdul Rahim, a local doctor.
	   A toddler lay with his head wrapped in thick layers of gauze,
staring listlessly. Inside the school a few women and children lay
under coarse hair blankets, as their relatives tried to comfort
them.
	   A woman lay sleeping with an intravenous drip draped over
two-brightly colored bracelets on her arm and a bottle on a nail in
the cracked wall.
	   Nearby a mother waved one hand over her ailing daughter trying
to create a breeze, while trying with the other hand to keep her
child from fiddling with the intravenous needle stuck in her wrist.
	   Valerie Purcell, a nurse with Merlin humanitarian aid agency,
sat in a tent outside the clinic encouraging an injured woman to
drink water to produce more breast milk for her tiny baby cradled
against her knees.
	   ``Many people are very badly traumatized,'' she said ``They are
telling me their stories ... they all need to tell.''
	   The United Nations has put out an appeal for helicopters
worldwide saying it has the aid ready to distribute to the victims
of the earthquake but limited means to get it to them.
	   The rugged mountain region has no roads leading from the
Badakshan capital of Faisas 2,300 people and leaving thousands more
homeless.

FIA cancels Indonesia Rally 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The world governing body of motor sports Wednesday
dropped the Rally of Indonesia from the 1998 race calendar.
	   The FIA, in a short statement, said it had withdrawn the
September rally from the schedule because of ``the current
situation in Indonesia and difficulties with transportation of
material for competing teams.''
	   The FIA said the schedule would be reduced from 14 to 13 events.
It said it was too late to substitute a rally in China, which was
tentatively set for June 19-22.
	   Indonesia could return to the calendar in 1999, the FIA said.
	   In a report released Wednesday, a government commission said
1,188 people died in riots last month in the Indonesian capital,
Jakarta.

At least 70 dead in high-speed German train crash 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS reference to 1967 accident, deadliest since World War II
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 70 people and
seriously injuring 200 as car after car of the train crumpled into
the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear. Police spokesman
Joachim Lindenberg said it appeared that the impact of the train
collapsed the overpass, plunging an auto that had been parked on
the structure.
	   The auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the
tracks, Lindenberg told German television n-tv. He did not say
whether the rail employee was hurt.
	   Earlier reports, based on witness accounts to authorities,
suggested that the auto had plunged into the train causing it to
derail.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while
the cars derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   At least 13 cars derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed the
cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. Survivors were taken to
hospitals throughout the region.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991. Ninety-four people were killed in a 1967
rail accident, Germany's deadliest since World War II, when a
barrier closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline, causing it to
explode setting the train on fire.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 800 rescue workers were at the scene, including trauma
surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free passengers
trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Christian Krettek, of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN
that rescue workers expected the death toll to rise, and it was
still unclear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

<TEXT>
	   Al-NIBAI, Iraq (AP) _ United Nations weapons inspectors searched
through reeds and sand dunes Wednesday for missing missile parts in
a bid to verify Iraq's claims that it has buried all its biological
and chemical missile warheads.
	   Wearing protective suits, masks, boots and gloves, some 27
experts under German Jean Jano used metal detectors and other
equipment in their search at Al-Nibai, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
north of Baghdad.
	   Others supervised an earth-moving machine as it uncovered the
nose cone of a missile warhead. ``This belongs to a conventional
warhead,'' shouted an Iraqi engineer.
	   In 1991, Iraq chose to destroy a great number of its long-range
missiles and bury them rather than declare them to U.N inspectors,
which has complicated the verification process.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed its entire arsenal, and that it is
impossible to account for every warhead. The United Nations says it
cannot take Iraq's word.
	   ``We hope that this work will help to settle some of the still
outstanding issues concerning the missile warheads,'' Jano, 61,
told The Associated Press. It is the first time a Western news
organization was allowed at a weapons search site.
	   Jano refused to say how far his team has progressed in verifying
Iraq's claims, or how many parts it has collected so far.
	   But Brig. Ismael Saeed Ahmad, the Iraqi official who supervised
the 1991 destruction and burial at al-Nibai, said U.N. monitors
have so far recovered enough parts to account for 49 biological and
chemical warheads. He did not say how many were buried.
	   As for conventional warheads, only 10 remain unaccounted for, he
told the AP later in Baghdad.
	   The area where Iraq buried its missiles is vast. Experts with
magnetic and electro-magnetic sensors placed small, red flags on
the ground to mark the next dig.
	   ``We've with us some of the latest state-of-the-art high-tech
equipment,'' said Vincent Murphy, a 69-year-old geophysicist from
Boston. ``It is all digitally recorded. The data is brought back in
the recorder to one of the vehicles and downloaded to the laptop.''
	   Advanced equipment is needed because satellite images cannot
penetrate the soil at al-Nibai, he said.
	   Jano said inspectors found ``aluminum canisters that are used
for chemical agents and some stainless steel canisters ... used for
biological agents.''
	   The excavation is scheduled to end June 18.
	   Jano said another team will arrive in Baghdad soon to analyze
the findings, now stored at Taji, a military camp 20 kilometers (12
miles) north of Baghdad.
	   Senior Iraqi officers looked on as the experts searched. The
Iraqis refuse to wear safety gear, saying the pieces of scrap
underground are non-toxic.
	   U.N. monitors burn their suits every day, and wash their hands
and feet in a bleach solution before leaving the site.
	   Accounting for special warheads is one of the main hurdles in
Iraq's efforts to declare itself clean of prohibited missiles with
ranges beyond 150 kilometers (90 miles).
	   Ahmad, the Iraqi brigadier, claimed all such missiles have now
been accounted for.
	   In addition, U.N. inspectors are believed to have accounted for
817 of the 819 Scud missiles in Iraq's arsenal.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of its weapons of
mass destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not lift the
sanctions slapped on Baghdad in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait.

Khatami plans to visit New York, address United Nations 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought a
more moderate course for Iran since his election a year ago, plans
to go to the United States to address the U.N. General Assembly in
September, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Referring to the planned address as a ``very important speech,''
the official said Khatami would discuss the position of Muslims in
the world and in the United Nations.
	   The statement was the first announcement of the planned trip,
though such a visit had been rumored for days. The trip would
require U.S. government permission.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Khatami
would urge the United Nations to give Islamic nations a permanent
seat on the Security Council.
	   Breaking through nearly 20 years of hostility, Khatami called
for a dialogue with Americans and more cultural and educational
exchanges in a broadcast interview last January.
	   Two previous Iranian presidents have addressed the United
Nations since the 1979 Islamic revolution. But both used their
speeches to attack the United States. Khatami could instead make a
gesture to American leaders.
	   Khatami will also use his trip to meet the 2 million strong
Iranian community in the United States, the official said. Many
Iranians fled their country to settle in the United States and
other Western countries after the revolution.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.

EU leaders visit Burundi 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ A European Union delegation expressed
optimism Wednesday that neighboring countries will at least suspend
an embargo against Burundi.
	   The resumption of peace talks in Arusha, Tanzania on June 15
``should lead, at least, to a suspension of sanctions,'' said Tony
Lloyd, British Foreign Office Minister responsible for Africa and
leader of the three-member delegation.
	   ``The evolution of the situation inside the country will
progressively eliminate the reasons for the embargo,'' he said.
	   With Lloyd were representatives from Austria and Luxembourg,
plus Aldo Ayello, the European Union's special envoy to the Great
Lakes region. They later left for Kinshasa, Congo.
	   African countries imposed an embargo against Burundi to pressure
Pierre Buyoya, who took power over the central African country in a
coup in July 1996, to negotiate with the majority Hutu opposition.
	   Buyoya argued he was the only one capable of halting fighting
between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus that has claimed more
than 200,000 lives since 1993. The violence has not stopped.
	   Hutu rebels are trying to oust Buyoya's Tutsi-led government and
army and reinstate a Hutu as president. Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president,
a Hutu, in October 1993.
	   Tutsis, who make up just 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, have controlled the country for all but four months since
independence in 1962. Hutus make up 85 percent of the population.

Kidnappers demand ransom for French hostage in Chechnya: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kidnappers have demanded dlrs 1.5 million in
ransom for the release of a Frenchman who was in charge of a
regional office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, a news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   Vincent Cochetel was abducted Jan. 29 by three masked gunmen in
North Ossetia, near Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya.
	   The Interfax news agency said Cochetel has been held in
Chechnya. It gave no other details on the ransom demand.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in Chechnya
and neighboring Russian regions by armed gangs who are mostly
motivated by ransom. At least 60 people are currently held captive
in Chechnya.
	   The most high-profile captive is Valentin Vlasov, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya. He was kidnapped at
gunpoint May 1.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon.- Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim called for efforts to remove deep-seated suspicions and
hostility between nations.
	   He said in conflicts, it is the people who pay the price, not
the state, and it is the poorest and the weakest who bear the brunt
of suffering.
	   Speaking at the opening of the 12th Asia Pacific Roundtable
-Confidence Building and Conflict Reduction, Anwar said: ``We must
arrest this drift to violence and nuclear adventurism.
	   ``We must oppose opportunistic politicians who fan the flames of
jingoism, be it in the name of religion or state.''
	   Anwar, alluding to an Asia with at least three nuclear powers
despite grappling with poverty, said only a civil society could
provide a framework for the removal of suspicion and distrust and
heal the wounds of history.
	   ``Thus, the promotion of civil society must be the prime concern
of diplomacy in Asia. A healthy state-civil society relationship
will contribute to the reduction of differences in political
practices, strengthen the marketplace and promote freedom.
	   ``A culture of democracy, founded on universal principles of
liberty, is the sine qua non (an essential requirement) for peace
in this world. In all this, persuasion must be our greatest
weapon.''
	   The speech also dissected what Anwar saw as ``cold reasoning of
realpolitik'' of conducting affairs among nations according to
calculations of power and national interest.
	   He also discussed how science and knowledge had exploded into
minute branches. ``New disciplines of knowledge are being born
every day.''
	   He said ethics and morality were scoffed at as intrusions of the
unrealistic and the impracticable into the cold-blooded affairs of
the state. ``As for the interest of the state, more often than not,
neither the fate nor the welfare of the ordinary people enters into
the equation.''
	   The roundtable which started yesterday and due to end on
Wednesday, is being attended by policy makers and academicians from
the United States, Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Laos,
Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
	   Held at Hotel Nikko, it is organised by Asean-Isis and Isis
Malaysia.
	   The New Straits Times is one of the sponsors.
	   Among the notable panelists are Thai Foreign Minister Dr Surin
Pitsuwan, former South Korea Foreign Minister Prof Hang Sung-Joo,
Andrew Sheng who is deputy chief executive of Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, former Foreign Minister Tan Sri Ghazali Shafie, acting
director of Japan Insitute of International Affairs, Makoto
Katsura, and Associate Professor Dr Anthony Bergin of Australian
Defence Studies Centre, University College, Australian Defence
Force Academy.
	   Among the topics of discussion were Currency Turmoil in Asia:
The Strategic Impact, The Threat from the Haze: What Must Be Done?,
The Strengthened Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Process and The
1999 Non-Proliferation Treaty and Preparatory Committee, and The
United States and China : A New Era of Relations.
	   Anwar also said that the global economy was rushing into the
third industrial revolution - from the age of steam engine,
followed by the automobiles and aeroplanes and now the information
revolution.
	   ``We have to reinvent our economic policies to bring them in
line with the information age. A new economic age brings with it
new challenges, to which we have to respond. The road to
destruction is paved with stubbornness in sticking to old modes of
thinking.''

	   WHEN it comes to the interior design of hotels or office
complexes, the name AxisNetwork Design Consultant Sdn Bhd keeps
coming up these days and for good reason.
	   The company's special touches at hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Port
Dickson and office complexes recently won it ISO 9001
certification, a badge of merit for quality in design, development,
production, installation and servicing.
	   The company's ``Midas touches'' can be seen at the Ming Court
Vista Hotel in Jalan Ampang which had its new look launched in
December last year.
	   Other hotels include the Radisson Plaza Hotel, Equatorial Hotel,
Swiss Garden Hotel, Dynasty Hotel and Stanford Hotels in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   The company has also designed the interiors of several resorts
outside Kuala Lumpur such as the Guoman Resort and Avillion village
resort in Port Dickson and Cherating.
	   It has also done work at other establishments like the
Gleaneagles Hospital, Jalan Ampang, and the PhileoAlied corporate
office in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Its managing director Foo Fatt Chuen said the company was
undertaking the refurbishment of Hyatt Regency Saujana Hotel in
Subang due for completion next month.
	   He said the interior design created by the company would greatly
depend on factors like requirements stated by the building owner.
	   ``From the building owner/operator's design brief, we plan our
design,''
	   he said.
	   For offices, he said the design would have to take into
consideration the client's corporate image.
	   ``Take for instance our design for PhileoAllied. Since its
concept is people oriented, we designed a simple interior to enable
interaction between people,'' he said.
	   ``The concept of simple interior also applies at the company's
bank.''
	   Creating interior designs for hotels is, however, different as
there will be more than one concept used.
	   ``Different types of space will need different designs to create
the required atmosphere although we will try to link as much as
possible the design of the public area such as the lobby with the
private area such as the room,'' he said.
	   Nonetheless, some of the space in a hotel need to have its
individual design, for example, the restaurants where the design
should reflect the themes that they are carrying.
	   He said AxisNetwork was established in 1991 with only three
staff including himself. However, with the booming economy of the
country then, the company did not take long to progress in the
business.
	   From three, the workforce grew to 38 when the construction
industry was at its peak last year.
	   The company's capability in delivering beautiful interior design
has won the confidence of corporate clients such as IGB Berhad,
Mycom Bhd, Olmpia Land Bhd, Reliance Pacific Bhd, Lion Corporation
Bhd, Hong Leong Corporation Bhd, YTL Industries Bhd, Tan  Tan
Development Bhd, Malaysian Tobacco Co. Bhd, Uniphoenix Corporation
Bhd, MBf Finance Bhd, Phileo Allied Bhd, Phileo Allied Bank, Parti
Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, Mulpha International Bhd and Konsortium
Perkapalan Bhd.
	   ``Now that the economy has slowed and the volume of projects we
receive have also declined, we have to retrench some of the staff
but the retrenchment was carried out voluntarily,'' he said, adding
that the company now had about 20 staff only.
	   Being closely connected to the construction industry, Foo said
AxisNetwork was badly affected by the economic downturn as its
revenue depended greatly on clients' ability to pay for the
services.
	   The economic slowdown, however, does not mean no business at all
for the company as there are still more good projects currently
being carried out.
	   ``Among the projects being carried include the refurbishment of
Hyatt Regency Saujana Hotel in Subang which will be completed in
July, The Westin Kuala Lumpur, Novotel Hotel Kuala Lumpur and
Century Hotel Kuala Lumpur; the Deputy Prime Minister's house in
Putrajaya and Putrajaya JW Marriott Hotel on which we will start
soon,'' he said.
	   He said gaining ISO 9001 certification, besides being an
assurance of good quality service to its customers, was also a
stepping stone to better and bigger business opportunities locally
and abroad.
	   He said the company had started exporting its services abroad,
like to Singapore and Thailand for the past five years or so. That
is in line with the company's objective of being internationally
acknowledged by its customers.

LandBank to Push for Cooperative Mergers, BUSINESS DAILY

	   The Land Bank of the Philippines (LandBank) will push for the
alliance of agricultural cooperatives into larger, more stable
blocs to enhance their capabilities in undertaking bigger economic
activities and prepare them for unrestricted global trade.
	   Atty. Jesus Diaz, acting LandBank president, said the move would
help farmer and fisherfolk cooperatives cope with the challenge of
developing into self-sustaining business units.
	   ``In view of globalization and market liberalization, we want to
encourage the cooperatives to upgrade their existing capabilities
and maturity level, and help them become competitive and highly
innovative in their respective trade or business,'' Diaz said.
	   On the local front, the inter-agency Tariff and Related Matters
(TRM) committee is currently reviewing the tariff structure of
sensitive agricultural products, which include rice and corn, as
part of adjustment measures in line with the country's regional
trade commitment.
	   In keeping up with the realignment of economies toward global
integration, an increasing number of companies, including the
biggest names in their respective industries, have resorted to
merger, buy-outs, and alliances primarily to keep their operations
afloat in a tightening field of competitors.
	   LandBank wants to cut down the number of cooperative units from
the present 8,000 to between 2,500 and 3,000 by integrating forces
and establishing at least one strong cooperative in every
municipality.
	   Moreover, such mergers will enable the cooperatives to become
more stable suppliers of goods and services, and provide training
and financial intermediation to members of other cooperatives,
aside from promoting better bargaining power and economies of
scale.
	   As an initial step, government agencies such as Department of
Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform, the Cooperative
Development Authority, and the Technology and Livelihood Resources
Center should initiate the merger of differently registered but
overlapping cooperatives to consolidate their functions.
	   Last month, LandBank brought together top cooperatives in a
Cooperative Alliance Congress to explore the concept of forming
umbrella groups and to identify areas where assistance can be
extended to smaller cooperatives.
	   State owned LandBank is a full service universal bank catering
to the financial and technical needs of agricultural cooperatives
throughout the country.
	   As of end 1997, LandBank's outstanding loans to small farmers
and fisherfolk cooperatives stood at P12.3 billion.

	   KOTA BARU, Mon. - Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat has
called for reforms and formulation of dadah rehabilitation
programmes to suit the spiritual needs of addicts.
	   He said this was in view of the ineffectiveness of the current
programmes which were mostly copied from other countries with
similar dadah abuse problems.
	   He said dadah rehabilitation centres should emphasise religious
lessons.
	   There should also be more programmes to illustrate dadahs'
destructive effects on the human body so as to instil fear among
the addicts, he added.
	   He told reporters this after opening the dadah awareness
programme for village heads at Kota Darulnaim yesterday.
	   Saying rehabilitation programmes had not had any success, Nik
Aziz pointed out the failure to reform addicts could be attributed
to the programmes which did not suit the needs of addicts.
	   ``We cannot expect rehabilitation programmes derived from
elsewhere to work effectively with the addicts here.''
	   However, he said certain programmes derived from other countries
could still be adopted but there was an urgent need to formulate
programmes to suit local needs.

	   MENTAKAB, Mon. - Four soldiers were killed when their car was
involved in a collision with a bus coming from the opposite
direction at Km1, Jalan Karak-Mentakab, opposite the Mentakab
Hospital, this morning.
	   The four victims, all from the 7th Rangers regiment, were
identified as David anak Kalau, 25, Bakir Naoda anak Usap, 24,
Jerry anak Dulie, 22, and Taichu anak Langkuae, 30.
	   The bus driver G. Krishnan, 46, and his six passengers escaped
unhurt.
	   It is understood that the bodies of the rangers were later sent
to the Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Kuantan. From there they
will be flown to Sarawak for burial.
	   State Internal Security and Public Order deputy chief Deputy
Superintendent Jamal Mohd Yusuf said the bus driver had been
detained to facilitate investigations into the crash.
	   In the incident which occurred about 5am, the car driven by
David, was believed to have gone out of control before coming to a
halt in the middle of the road.
	   ``The bus rammed head-on into the car and dragged it for about
15 metres,'' said Jamal.
	   He added that firemen took about 90 minutes to extricate the
bodies from the wreck.

Petronas Gas to improve operational efficiencies, BUSINESS TIMES

	   ALTHOUGH faced with a dampened demand for power due to the
economic downturn, Petronas Gas Bhd will continue to invest and
improve its operational efficiencies.
	   In his annual statement, Petronas Gas chairman Tan Sri Mohd
Hassan Marican expresses confidence that the continued improvement
of the group's operational efficiencies will negate the impact of
the slowdown.
	   Meanwhile, chief executive officer Abdul Rahim Abu Bakar says
the demand for gas is expected to grow at an average of 11 per cent
annually in the coming years.
	   ``The overall demand for gas, which is driven mainly by the
power sector, is expected to remain stable,'' says Abdul Rahim.
	   Pre-tax profit ended up 11.3 per cent higher at RM958.10 million
for the year ended March 31 1998, as against RM860.54 million for
the last corresponding year.
	   This was achieved on higher turnover of RM1.47 billion for the
year under review, compared with RM1.26 billion previously.
	   Profit after tax rose 13.1 per cent to RM942.56 million from
RM833.53 million before.
	   This was due mainly to a 17 per cent jump in the volume of gas
processed, combined with favourable operating conditions which
helped ensure the reliability of gas processed and transmitted to
customers.
	   Earnings per share rose 12.7 per cent to 52.2 sen from 46.3 sen
previously.
	   The board of directors have declared an interim tax exempt
dividend of 5 per cent per share for the year under review.
	   Total volume of sales gas processed by the four Gas Processing
Plants (GPP) rose to 410,260 million standard cu ft (mmscf) in the
year of review from 355,145 mmscf before.
	   The production of butane increased to 451,108 metric tonnes (MT)
from 447,119 MT previously. However, production of propane was
slightly lower at 583,212 MT from 583,251 MT.
	   Work has started on Malaysia's first Centralised Utility
Facilities (CUF) in Kertih and Gebeng.
	   ``The CUF project represents a strategic long-term investment
for Petronas Gas,'' Abdul Rahim says.
	   The project will also serve as a catalyst to encourage Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) by offering common utilities to the
petrochemical industry and other plants within its vicinity.
	   Detailed engineering works are in progress. Piling works have
started at the Kertih site, while construction of the Gebeng plant
will start soon.

	   I REFER to the letter, ``Disgusted with air-con repair company''
(NST, May 27).
	   I had a similar experience but it was with a plumber last year
after the water tank in my office sprang a leak. It was discovered
when the meter reader found my usage to be RM600.
	   The plumber for the job must be licensed by the Jabatan Bekalan
Air Selangor. They would waive the charges for beyond normal usage
when the receipt for repair was produced.
	   The plumber I hired was not registered and had to borrow someone
else's certificate. And for that, I had to pay an extra RM80! After
much argument, he said he would just remove the spare part and in
effect undo the job.
	   I eventually got a full refund from the plumber.

Police arrest six-man drug ring, seize dlrs 1.2 million in hashish 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police arrested a six-man drug ring and
seized 222 kilograms (488 pounds) of hashish that they smuggled
into Egypt from Jordan, a police official said Wednesday.
	   The drugs seized Tuesday had an estimated street value of 4
million Egyptian pounds (nearly dlrs 1.2 million). The drugs were
stored in special caches in a truck that came by ferry from Jordan
to the Egyptian town of Nuweiba.
	   Maj. Gen. Mohammed Sharawi, head of the Interior Ministry's
Narcotics Department, announced the arrests, saying police allowed
the truck to enter Egypt after being tipped by Jordanian officials
of the smuggling plot.
	   Arrested were three Syrians who rotated driving the truck, a
Jordanian who arranged the shipment, an Egyptian who was to sell
the hashish, and the Saudi owner of a farm where the shipment was
to be stowed.
	   The six men admitted to the smuggling, Sharawi said. If
convicted, all face death by hanging. Egypt has strengthened its
penalty for drug dealing from life in prison to the death sentence.

	   June is for Brides There is a new face at Cathay Pacific
Airways, and that is Alex Shum's, the new country manager for the
Philippines. As such, he is responsible for the overall operations
and implementations of business strategies in Manila as well as in
Cebu.
	   Shum is a graduate of Higher Diploma in System Analysis from the
Hongkong Polytechnic University in 1988. He completed his
Foundation Diploma in Management from the University of Hongkong in
1994. He finished his Masters in Business Management from the
University of Michigan.
	   The youthful Shum has assumed several positions including that
of country manager in Thailand. He then returned to Hongkong to
assume the functions of assistant revenue planning manager for the
airline, with several promotions that followed prior to his recent
appointment in the Philippines.
	   A Hongkong Chinese national, Shum is married and has two
children.
	   A recent fair dubbed ``Hail to the Bride'' was held at The
Heritage Hotel Manila, produced by Runway Productions. It showcased
a dazzling array of wedding services and accessories, ranging from
the varied menu offerings, venue, cakes, florists, giveaways,
cosmetics, gowns, invitations, photography, honeymoon destinations,
and even assistance on finding and decorating the newlyweds' first
home! A fashion show directed by Runway Productions' Joey Espino
featured an elegant array of wedding gowns created by the country's
top designers like Pitoy Moreno, Barge Ramos, Danny de la Cuesta,
and Frederick Peralta, among others. They ranged from stark simple
to elegant as well as innovative and daring, which caused
spectators in the audience to wonder out loud if a few would be
appropriate to be worn in church.
	   It appears that present-day brides to do not necessarily stick
to the traditional white, and may settle for other colors including
gold fabric (but probably this would be more appropriate during
one's golden wedding anniversary). Times have sure changed, and
ideas can get wild.
	   One of the more practical souvenirs for newlyweds to consider or
even for guests to give are beautifully-crafted frames made of
lahar (volcanic ash) in different hues, shapes, and designs. These
were on display at the fair, especially crafted by Sonny Osi of
Excel Frames and Decors. They are exported and the selections are
endless. Quite reasonably-priced at that! These bridal fairs are of
great help to couples planning their wedding.
	   With the Catering and Convention Services Department Managers
assisting the couples, it enables them to arrange for what is to be
one of the most memorable days in their lives. There are various
options to choose from and fit to suit individual budgets.
	   The banquet themes range from elegant, romantic, to Filipiniana
motifs.
	   President-in-waiting Joseph Estrada's choice of members to fill
up his cabinet tend to amaze even his detractors. The interviews
also show a different side of ``Erap'', as broadcasters opt to call
him. Reputedly poor in English grammar or enunciation, friends will
assure you that most of the time, the actor in Estrada made him
purposely emphasize on speaking broken English, to the point of
launching a book on jokes all about him. In a way, it was a source
of amusement to many, and for the Filipino in general, known for
his sense of humor.
	   Watch him and listen closely. The improvement is very
noticeable.

	   THERE is no doubt that the Internet and the advent of electronic
commerce or e-commerce has the potential to provide opportunities
for businesses that were once confined to a small market.
	   ``The possibility for Asia Pacific is endless and this is true
for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
	   ``If they were in the past relegated to small markets,
e-commerce now allows them to compete with large companies,'' said
senior adviser to US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr Philip W Yun.
He added that with little cost, small companies can market their
products to a large and international market.
	   Yun, who is also the US representative to the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (Apec) working group on human resources, was
speaking at a talk organised by the US Information Service and the
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   Information technology, he said is ``precipitating fundamental
change in the way of doing business'' making it necessary for
businesses to develop a better understanding of e-commerce.
	   He emphasised that the private sector has to be the innovator
and the mover to improve e-commerce knowledge. Apec countries, he
said, cannot be left behind as e-commerce is ``not a passing fad''.
	   The private sector, he added, can make use of Apec to test new
ideas and eliminate hurdles as well as tap into the knowledge of
Apec countries.

Eds: UPDATES with former economy minister's call for customers to
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Employees of Greece's fourth-largest bank
refused Wednesday to scale back a three-week strike despite the
government's concession to one of their main demands.
	   Ionian Bank workers walked off the job May 8 protesting
government plans to sell off the state-run bank, part of a broad
plan to streamline the economy in view of European monetary union.
	   Socialist Premier Costas Simitis initially insisted no
concessions could be made and that Ionian's privatization was an
essential part of plans to trim the inflated public sector.
	   But the government backed down to one of the unionists' main
demands Tuesday _ providing current Ionian employees with a
guaranteed job until the retirement age of 62.
	   National Economy Minister Yannos Papantoniou was quoted by Greek
media saying a clause will be included in the bank's sale contract
that forbids the new owner from firing Ionian workers.
	   Speaking after a meeting with unionists, Papantoniou said the
new proposal should not create any problems in the bank's
privatization prospects. He added that ``everything will be solved
when the bank begins operating normally,'' local media said.
	   But Ionian workers' union president Yiannis Markakis vowed the
strike would continue until the government revoked the sale plan
altogether.
	   Independent deputy and former national economy minister
Stephanos Manos said the government's concession wiped out all
benefits from Ionian's privatization, and called on its customers
to withdraw their funds and deposit them in private or foreign
banks.
	   ``Only if the majority of citizens begin reacting against deals
between politicians and unionists ..., only then will there be hope
for something to change in this place,'' Manos was quoted by local
media as saying.
	   Any further concessions in privatization plans could jeopardize
the government's efforts to join the EU's single currency club by
2001.
	   In an interview with the Sunday Eleftherotypia newspaper,
central bank governor Lukas Papademos said Ionian's sale will
``accelerate the restructuring of the banking sector and the
creation of a competitive environment ... That is the reason why
it's necessary to sell the bank before the end of the year.''

	   A former central bank official criticized yesterday government's
efforts to prop up the peso through non-deliverable forwards and
currency swap arrangements with foreign banks.
	   In an interview, former Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)
Treasurer Sergio Edeza said while non-deliverable forwards
protected the peso from wild fluctuations, these instruments failed
to provide a sufficient cover for most businessmen.
	   A non-deliverable forward contract is an instrument that
borrowers use to cover their dollar liabilities. The central bank
and banks shoulder exchange rate differentials through these
instruments while conserving the country's international reserves.
	   The BSP allowed exporters to open non-deliverable forward
contracts as long as they sold the same amount of dollars in the
spot market. For every one dollar exporters sold, the central bank
provided currency protection up to one dollar of their outstanding
dollar obligation.
	   Edeza also said the currency swap arrangements between the BSP
and some foreign banks were also ineffective.
	   ``It gives you time to delay the risk but there will be a demand
for dollars at some future time unless there are inflows. But
currently there are none so the dollar demand is just delayed,'' he
said.
	   While it has not been actively intervening in the financial
market, the central bank has been reported to be quietly engaging
in swap arrangements with some foreign banks to prop up dollar
liquidity in the system.
	   Industry sources said government had entered into dollar swap
arrangements with Bank of America, The Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp., and Standard Chartered Bank to prop up the peso.

	   THREE-month KLibor futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange
closed steadier yesterday amid weak market sentiment, a dealer
said.
	   The market was quiet as most players stayed on the sidelines
following the stabilised interbank rates on the money market
coupled with the weakening of the ringgit against the US dollar,
the dealer added.
	   June 98 was higher by two ticks to 89.02 (implied yield 10.98
per cent), September 98 rose by seven basis points to 88.80
(implied yield 11.20 per cent), and December 98 soared by eight
ticks to 88.75 (implied yield 11.25 per cent).
	   Turnover for the day fell to 52 lots from 139 lots on Monday
while open interests stood at 3,145 contracts from 3,207 contracts
previously.
	   On the money market, the KLibor one-month money and three-month
money remained unchanged at 11.00 per cent and 11.03 per cent,
respectively.

	   THE price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) rose 41 sen to
end at RM22.35 per kg yesterday due to the reeling ringgit and
strong demand from buyers, a dealer said.
	   Three-month tin on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was US$40
lower overnight, the dealer added.
	   At the opening level of RM21.94 per kg, initial bids stood at
125 tonnes against offers of 91 tonnes.
	   Turnover declined to 101 tonnes compared to 109 tonnes on
Monday.
	   The premium between the KLTM and that of the LME narrowed to
US$2 from US$6 previously.

	   I have often asked myself that question and each time manage to
somehow convince myself that there is still a lot of juice left in
me. Just what does being burned out mean? I suppose there would be
some medical description of this condition, but in more practical
terms, this means that you have ceased to be productive since you
have used up all of your creative fuel, hence, burned out.
	   Thinking about it, does everyone qualify to get burned out? This
may be so since different people have different levels of
responsibility and capability. Therefore, as an individual's
capability is overwhelmed by his responsibility or what is expected
of him, he starts feeling the pressure and eventually gets burned
out. I guess this is the reason why a job burn out is more commonly
talked about among executives rather than by their drivers.
	   While being totally burned out is not good since there is
nothing left, the process of getting there is what makes us more
productive. To shine a light, you need to burn fuel and the more
fuel you burn, the brighter the light gets. The trick is to find a
way to burn the fuel efficiently and to keep on getting a supply of
fuel.
	   How does one burn the fuel efficiently? Simple -- by keeping the
friction factors down to a minimum. What I call friction factors
are some negative characteristics normally associated with geniuses
who are under a lot of pressure, or people who are just obnoxious.
These would include irritability, paranoia, detachment, a
superiority complex ,and very likely, all of the above.
	   A person becomes irritable when there is a great deal of
pressure to meet deadlines or to deliver something that borders on
being impossible. The person in question does not want to be
bothered with minor details given the tremendous challenge he is
facing. He also gets irritated by things that seem so obvious to
him, yet need to be explained to others.
	   Paranoia also sets in when he feels that no one else seems to be
able to relate to the problems he is facing. Every question is
supposed of being a trick question, every action is viewed with
suspension and every person is out to get our man.
	   Detachment becomes a defense mechanism, there is no time to get
bogged down by emotions or unproductive discourse. This detachment
also leads to a short attention span. The mind identifies
priorities and when it realizes that the current conversation has a
low yield in achieving the goal, it uses its mental ability to
think about something else, leaving the body behind on auto pilot.
	   While a superiority complex may not be entirely without basis,
it is nonetheless a friction factor. After all, chances are the
most productive and capable people are given the difficult tasks
because they have the best chance of getting the job done. Everyone
else is viewed as an idiot or someone in the way.
	   Keeping the friction factors in check, the pressure and our
ability to cope with it gives us the cutting edge, keeping us on
our toes and heightening our sense and abilities. Having covered
the efficiency factor while we are burning a maximum, how then do
we keep the flame alive?
	   Different things motivate different people and whatever
motivates us is the fuel that keeps us burning bright. It could be
money, recognition, personal satisfaction, curiosity, honor, or ego
that fuels our burning desire to do more. This may seem so simple
but it is true. Once the reason for doing something is removed, the
fuel flow stops and the flame dies.
	   So, the next time you or someone else asks you: Are you burned
out? The best answer you can give is: No, but I'm on my way.

Israel: Mastermind of Achille Lauro hijacking no security threat 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Abbas comment in graf 9
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A former PLO guerrilla chief who mastermined
the 1985 murder of an American Jew during the Achille Lauro cruise
ship hijacking does not pose a threat to Israeli security, the
attorney general ruled Wednesday.
	   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein wrote that Israel doesn't
plan to seek the arrest of Mohammed Abbas, who is currently
visiting in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.
	   Rubinstein responded to a petition by two Israelis and Dov
Hikind, a New York State Assemblyman from Brooklyn, who have asked
the Supreme Court to order the Israel to arrest and try Abbas for
murder. The court has not said when it would issue a decision.
	   In a statement to the court on, Rubinstein said Abbas ``does not
pose a security threat'' and that an arrest ``would probably cause
real friction with the Palestinian side.''
	   Guerrillas acting on Abbas' orders seized the Italian cruise
ship off Egypt in 1985. They shot an elderly American passenger in
a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, and threw his body overboard.
	   The hijackers surrendered to Egyptian authorities, who put Abbas
and his men on a flight for Tunisia, where the PLO was
headquartered at the time. But the U.S. Navy forced the flight down
in Italy and the Italian authorities allowed Abbas to flee.
	   An Italian court later convicted Abbas and two other PLO
guerrillas in absentia and sentenced them to life in prison.
	   In 1996, Israel allowed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, to
return to the Gaza Strip to attend a session of the Palestine
National Council. Since then he has returned to Gaza three times
and has described the current stay as an extended one.
	   `` We had always said that what took place on the ship had not
been planned and had not been organized and I wasn't on the ship,''
Abbas told The Associated Press from Gaza.
	   Under a 1993 peace agreement with the Palestinians, Israel
allowed thousands of PLO guerrillas to return from abroad and enter
the new autonomous Palestinian areas. Rubinstein wrote that ``it
would not be reasonable to prosecute (Abbas) for acts which he
committed before Sept. 13 1993.''

	   The talks between the government and the transport owners and
workers of the northern region on the toll issue of the Bangabandhu
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge (BJMB) ended inconclusively here on
Tuesday.
	   The government asked the Uttarbanga Sarak Paribahan Malik-Sramik
Joutha Parishad-the body representing the owners and workers-to
submit their specific proposals about the toll rates for
consideration by the authorities.
	   The meeting, held at the Bangladesh Secretariat, was presided
over by Communications Minister Anwar Hossain.
	   Thirty-two representatives of the Parishad, led by its Convenor
Baby Islam attended the meeting where Shahjahan Khan MP, President
of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Sramik Federation was also present.
	   Government officials, including Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury,
Secretary, Jamuna Bridge Division, Syed Rezaul Hayat, Secretary,
Communication, and A N Hussain, Chairman, Bangladesh Road Transport
Authority (BRTA) were also present.
	   The meeting discussed the 15-point charter of demands presented
by the Parishad, but the demand for reducing the toll rates
dominated the talks.
	   The authorities have already announced the toll rates for using
the bridge to be opened on June 23. The Parishad has demanded the
refixation of the rates as, according to them, the new rates are
much higher than the existing ferry-rate.
	   The toll rates for a heavy truck has been fixed at Taka 1250
which is Taka 1000 for crossing the river by ferry. The toll rates
for small trucks (less than 5 tonnes) and medium trucks have been
fixed at Taka 750 and Taka 1000 respectively. The existing
ferry-rate for smaller trucks varies between Taka 390 and Taka 702.
	   The toll rates fixed for other vehicles, including passenger
buses and private cars are also higher than the existing ferry
rates.
	   According to a meeting source, the government side justified the
toll rates saying the bridge users can save much time compared with
the time needed by ferries.
	   The minister, however, advised the Parishad to submit their
specific proposals about the rate which can be examined and
considered by the government.
	   The meeting also discussed the other demands of the Parishad and
the government side assured the Parishad that its demands would be
looked into.

	   LOCAL rubber prices extended Monday's downtrend to close easier
yesterday on lacklustre trading, a dealer said.
	   July RSS-One dropped 1.5 sen to 289.50 sen per kg while SMR-20
slipped two sen to 283.50 sen.
	   ``The market sentiment is weak,'' a dealer said, he added that
there were no enquiries and trading was seen in the market today
despite the lower rubber prices offered.
	   The International Natural Rubber Organisation's (Inro) daily
market indicator price for June 1 was quoted at 203.83
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 204.77 cents on May 29.
	   The five-day moving average was at 205.92 cents per kg versus
206.88 cents previously.

Estrada to Influence Choice for Speaker, BUSINESS DAILY

	   Publicly, President-elect Joseph Estrada is leaving the field
open. His approval, however, will ultimately decide who will sit as
the next Speaker of the House of Representatives.
	   ``Estrada is an unorthodox type of a leader. He needs to be
comfortable so he is expected to put his mind and influence the
outcome of the speakership,'' Rizal Rep. Gilberto Duavit told
reporters on Monday.
	   ``The bottom line is if (Estrada) wants it, he will have it.
Whoever sits as Speaker, kanya iyon (it's his),'' said Duavit.
	   The incoming Chief Executive has said he will not meddle in the
selection of the next Speaker.
	   Estrada's Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Lammp) has named
Duavit as one of its likely bets for House Speaker. The party is
also reportedly considering Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo and Cebu Rep.
Ernesto Herrera.
	   An odd-man out in the race is Las Pias Rep. Manuel Villar.
	   Villar, a billionaire property developer, is a member of the
Lakas-NUCD party of outgoing President Fidel Ramos but has gained
support from key leaders of Lammp.
	   Duavit, Arroyo and Herrera ganged up on Villar in a recent Lammp
assembly, stressing the party should rally around ``true-blue''
members.
	   Arroyo said a lawmaker who had been with Lammp during its days
as an opposition party would know how to ``repair the credibility
of the Lower House, which was damaged by the previous
administration.''
	   ``The House must regain its integrity...and infuse
intellectualism in the legislative process,'' he said.
	   Herrera, a former senator, stressed Lammp should name candidates
for House Speaker and Senate President to ensure the Estrada
administration's legislative agenda would have full support from
Congress.
	   ``The Senate and the Lower House should be led by Lammp members.
I cannot agree with the idea that the two chambers will be led by
different parties.
	   The incoming administration is Lammp. Let's not blur it by not
putting our own Speaker,'' he said.
	   Incoming Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, a former House
minority leader and one of Estrada's political lieutenants, said
Lammp was not yet dropping Villar as one of its bets.
	   This, he said, was in recognition of Villar's ``good work'' for
Estrada as Las Pias lawmaker during the last elections.
	   ``He also worked hard for us and you can see the result of that.
We won in his district,'' Zamora told reporters.
	   He broadly hinted that Villar might defect to Lammp.
	   ``Either he's with us or he's against us, but he'd rather be
with us,'' he said.
	   Zamora said earlier Villar had expressed ``serious desire'' to
join Lammp, fueling speculations he junked Lakas standard bearer
Jose de Venecia in the May 11 presidential race.

BNP leaders vow to scrap CHT deal, THE INDEPENDENT

	   BNP leaders at a round-table discussion yesterday said that they
would scrap the CHT peace accord and the laws enacted on the basis
of the ``so-called'' treaty when they came to power.
	   They believed that the treaty, which they said was signed to
serve the interests of India, was a threat to the sovereignty of
Bangladesh and the way it was done was an utter violation of the
Constitution as it had curbed the fundamental rights of the 99.6
per cent people of the country.
	   A group of university teachers and journalists who joined the
discussion organised by the Jatiyatabadi Mahila Dal at a city hotel
also echoed the fears expressed by the BNP leaders and asked the
political party to initiate political agenda against the treaty and
the laws promulgated on the basis of the treaty.
	   Chaired by the Mahila Dal convenor, Begum Khurshid Jahan Haq,
MP, the meeting was also addressed by the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition in Parliament, Professor AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury,
Colonel (Retd) Oli Ahmed, MP, MK Anwar, MP, Dr. Khandker Mosharrof
Hossain, MP, Anwar Zahid, Professor M Moniruzzaman Mia, Dr. Enamul
Haq, Dr. Hasanuzzaman Chowdhury, Dr. Selina Ahsan, Dr. Jasimuddin
Ahmed, journalists MA Aziz and Amir Khashru.
	   Badruddoza Chowdhury said that the trouble began in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts during the regime of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
He first sent the army to tackle the situation now the Awami League
would have to bear the responsibility for the consequences.
	   ``We waged the War of Liberation for an undivided Bangladesh and
we'll resist all conspiracies against the sovereignty of the
country,'' he said.
	   Oli Ahmed said that he was directly involved in dealing with the
CHT issue during the regime of the BNP. He was ready to accept any
punishment if any one could prove that the BNP made any deal with
the tribal people which went against the interests of the country.
	   Khurshid Jahan urged all to respond to the call of the BNP
chief, Begum Khaleda Zia, to resist the conspiracy against the
sovereignty of the country. ``Signing the treaty was sabotage,''
she said.
	   MK Anwar said that the Speaker had failed to maintain neutrality
in Parliament.
	   Professor Moniruzzaman Mia said that the formation of the
regional council was a threat to the sovereignty of the country.
	   Anwar Zahid pointed out that India had made the treaty signed
for its own interests. ``We have kept Anup Chetia, who helped our
freedom fighters in Assam in 1971 during our War of Liberation,
captive in our jail,'' he said. ``Even if it's not possible to help
Anup Chetia in his people's struggle for freedom, our country must
not work to kill them''.

	   Lakas lost the biggest prize in the recent elections, but the
party's lower house members may still have something to crow about.
	   Based on House of Representatives' records, half of the 42
lawmakers who chalked up a perfect attendance in the third regular
session of the 10th Congress came from the Lakas party.
	   Lawmakers met 61 times in the third regular session that ran for
seven months. There are 219 members of the lower house.
	   With this ''achievement'', Lakas has beaten it's closet rival
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Lammp) in terms of the
''attendance race.'' However, the ''win'' may have been a given
since Lammp was only formed in November last year.
	   Six members from the National People's Coalition (NPC) recorded
a perfect attendance during the period in review.
	   Only three lawmakers out of the seven candidates gunning for the
speakership earned a perfect attendance.
	   These are Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo, Leyte Rep. Sergio Antonio
Apostol, and Maguindanao Rep. Simeon Datumanong.
	   The four other candidates for the speakership who failed to
secure a perfect attendance are: Isabela Rep. Gilberto Duavit
(three absences with notice, two with sickness and three on
official mission); Las Pias Rep.
	   Manuel Villar (two absences with notice); and Quezon City 4th
District Rep.
	   Feliciano Belmonte (one absence with notice and one on official
mission).
	   Former senator and newly-elected Bohol first district Rep.
Ernesto Herrera is also being groomed for the speakership.
	   Villar's attendance record raised eyebrows of some lawmakers and
journalists covering the House. Some of his colleagues -- and some
reporters -- claim Villar is seldom seen at the House of
Representatives.
	   The solons, meanwhile, who topped the ''absent list'' were
Zamboanga del Norte Rep. Romeo Jalosjos and Bacolod City Rep. Romeo
Guanzon.
	   Jalosjos, records showed, had 14 absences with notice and two
without notice. Jalosjos was jailed pending the trial of a rape
case. He was convicted recently. Guanzon, meanwhile, had 16
absences filed under sick leave.
	   Other notable absentees were Tarlac's first district Rep. Jose
Cojuangco Jr. who had six (with notice) plus another seven (on
official mission).
	   House Speaker Jose de Venecia failed to report twice during the
third regular session of the 10th Congress. His absences were filed
under ''official mission''. Former First Lady and Leyte Rep. Imelda
Marcos had a total three absences (with notice).
	   A total 39 lawmakers recorded a single absence during the third
session which ran from July 28, 1997 to Feb. 20, 1998. Copyright

NATO accelerates plans to boost Albanian, Macedonia borders 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo
Eds: TOPS with NATO chief insisting it keeps ``all options open''
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Xavier Solana
reiterated Wednesday the alliance was keeping ``all options open,''
including a military reply to Serbia's violent crackdown on a
separatist movement in Kosovo.
	   ``The news from Kosovo is not good. The situation is
deteriorating,'' Solana told reporters. Therefore, he said, the
allies agreed to accelerate plans to help Albania and Macedonia
seal their borders with Kosovo.
	   Also, at a meeting here, the NATO ambassadors reiterated they
will consider sending combat troops to those nations.
	   ``We are keeping all options open,'' Solana said at a brief
press conference.
	   In Kosovo, thousands of refugees left their villages and towns,
fleeing Serb security forces.
	   Solana rejected an analogy with Bosnia in 1991-92 saying NATO
was not asleep at the wheel as Kosovo spiraled into ever more
violence and chaos. In Kosovo, ``we are trying not only to respond
to events, but we are trying to prevent events,'' he said.
	   The allies have asked military planners to study the possibility
of military intervention.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed (with that) until we have
solid, well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO official,
who asked not to be named.
	   Getting that advice ``would take several days'' and get a first
review by the NATO defense ministers who are to meet here June
11-12, the official said.
	   Meanwhile, the NATO allies accelerated technical and military
assistance for Albania and Macedonia to help them secure their
borders with Kosovo. The first military advisors are to leave in a
matter of days.
	   Also, previously scheduled small-scale joint maneuvers in
Albania and Macedonia were given more priority and NATO's civil
emergency and planning section was told to contact U.N. officials
dealing with the exodus of Kosovo refugees.
	   ``There is a great sense of urgency to get these things
organized,'' said the NATO official.
	   In the months leading up to the war in Bosnia in 1992, the NATO
allies waffled over how to contain that Balkan crisis.
	   Officials said history was not repeating itself in Kosovo.
	   ``NATO ... cannot do things which are not guaranteed to be
successful. We are going quickly but we recognize there is a need
for substantive military work'' before a decision to deploy many
thousands of troops is taken, said the NATO official .
	   There have been no reports in Kosovo like those in Bosnia of
massive civilian roundups or massacres by Serb forces.
	   But attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths
of women and children have prompted comparisons to the ethnic war
in Bosnia. More than 200 people have been killed in the southern
Serb province where 90 percent of the population are ethnic
Albanians.
	   NATO's Kosovo policy is guided by the belief the province should
not become independent but be given back the autonomy it once had
within the Yugoslav Republic.

	   The Supreme Court has junked a suit filed by the Kalookan city
government over a land occupied by Grand Central Ever Gotesco,
allowing retailer Jose Go to use the property as a collateral to
bail out Orient Commercial Banking Corp.
	   ``That's what they (Go family) told us,'' Alberto Reyes, deputy
governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), told The
Business Daily. ``The Supreme Court has allowed the sale of the
property so we can use it as a collateral.''
	   The high court decision was promulgated last week, he said.
	   The central bank has required Go to submit more collateral to
cover over P6 billion worth of bad debts saddling Orient Bank.
	   Titles to prime properties submitted earlier by the
Chinese-Filipino businessman were considered insufficient to cover
Orient Bank's non-performing loans.
	   Go founded Orient Bank and was said to have gotten a majority of
the bank's non-performing loans.
	   Some 316 titles, including those covering Go's personal assets,
have already been submitted to the BSP to set in motion the
rehabilitation of Orient Bank.
	   Vicente Valdepeas Jr., a member of the Monetary Board, said the
value of Grand Center Ever Gotesco was ``very substantial.'' He
said it would be enough to cover loans acquired by Orient Bank's
owners, officers and shareholders.
	   ``It is the jewel of the crown, which plays a critical role,''
said Valdepeas.
	   Orient Bank has been on holiday since Feb. 13. Bad debts
extended mostly to its owners and stockholders led to the bank's
closure.
	   Asian Appraisers, one of three companies government hired to
assess Orient Bank's assets and liabilities, completed its
evaluation last week. The Development Bank of the Philippines and
Cuervo Far East Ltd. had yet to submit their reports.
	   Depositors of Orient Bank earlier agreed to keep some P1.5
billion in the bank's vaults.
	   The BSP has asked Orient Bank to hold on to at least 60%, or P2
billion, of the money deposited in its vaults to ensure a smooth
rehabilitation.
	   Orient Bank has been asking its depositors to sign a statement
assuring they will not withdraw their money when the bank re-opens.
	   The BSP earlier agreed to restructure P3.4 billion worth of
pending claims provided depositors keep their money with Orient
Bank to make the bank more attractive to prospective investors.

	   America is not necessarily the Promised Land. For all the talk
of progress and enlightenment in the Modern Twentieth Century,
racism and discrimination still exist in the Land of the Brave and
the Home of the Free. And the Filipinos who've relocated to Uncle
Sam and made a permanent living there are not all rich and happy.
	   Flipzoids, a play written, directed, and produced by
Filipino-Americans that deals with the Filipino immigration
experience in America, will definitely shatter some popular myths.
A special presentation of the Cultural Center of the Philippines
(CCP) in cooperation with the New York-based Ma-Yi Theater
Ensemble, it goes onstage this week at the Tanghalang Batute from
June 3-7, 7:30 p.m., with weekend matinees at 3 p.m.
	   This three-man, one-act play dramatizes the immigrant's
perennial struggle between assimilation into the American culture
on one hand, and the desire to retain his unique identity on the
other.
	   It is a subject continually explored and plumbed into greater
depths by the Ma-Yi Theater Company. Founded in 1989, part of
Ma-Yi's vision is to present for the theater original works about
the Fil-Am experience or Filipinos' experience in America. Chatting
in between rehearsals at the CCP, playwright and Ma-Yi founder
Ralph Pea elaborates how this vision came about.
	   ``The Fil-Am story occurs, basically, from the time that the
Filipinos immigrated to the US which is turn of the century, 1920s,
1930s...That story. The bone of contention is that Fil-Am or
Filipinos in America have their own set of dynamics and their own
set of concerns [that are] as legitimate as any ethnic group in the
US, [and which is] an integral part of the American fabric. The
argument is, should we just take plays from Manila and stage them
for our audience in New York? And our answer to that is `no'.
Because the writers here [in Manila] are not writing for
Filipino-Americans, they're writing for Filipinos. Our concerns,
the dynamics of the Fil-Am community, are completely separate from
what's here in Manila. We took plays by Filipinos and presented
them to our audience in New York, and they didn't mean anything,
because their lives are so completely different from the realities
being presented by the plays. And what happens is that we end up
doing museum pieces for them which we don't want. We want theater
that is meaningful to our audience, that affects their lives and
reflects their realities. How do you do that? You start writing
about them.''
	   Back in New York over the past 10 years, Ma-Yi has found its
audience.
	   Since its founding, it has produced original works written by
such writers as Jessica Hagedorn, Nicky Paraiso, Louella Dizon,
Chris Millado, Han Ong, and, of course, Pea. While 50% of its
audience come from the Fil-Am community, Ma-Yi has been successful
in reaching out across other cultural and ethnic barriers. Pea
maintains, ``We have a very good audience. We have survived for 10
years and that's not easy. Especially in New York where the cost of
producing is astronomical. The average production cost is $75,000
per show. That's not easy. So if you think about that, if you don't
have a firm audience base, there's no way you can make that up in
grants. The mere fact that we've lasted this long goes directly to
the heartening fact that we have very good support from our
community and from the New York theater audience.''
	   What would the Manila theater audience find interesting in
Flipzoids?
	   Pea replies, ``Flipzoids gives the Manila audience an insight
into what it means to be a Filipino in America. There are a lot of
misconceptions about that. Like being rich and happy. That is the
prevalent conception in the streets, about us who are there --
we're earning dollars, we're happy. But it's not true. It depends
on how you view the promised land.
	   I think this play speaks directly to that issue, on what we have
to go through. It's Fil-Am in the way it's told, but it's the
universal immigrant story of the US. Every immigrant goes through
this experience.
	   Flipzoids asks the questions: What do I give up? How do I fit
in? The thorny issues of compromise that go along with
assimilation.
	   ``The US has a way of prescribing what an American is -- it has
its own definition -- and unless you fit that mold... The US is run
by white people. Ma-Yi is based in New York, which is an entirely
different animal by itself, but if you go to the Midwest, we
Fil-Ams are still thought of as Chinks, and not even Filipinos.
There's racism in the US -- I think everywhere -- and Flipzoids
deals with that. The US is still a racially motivated country.
Actually, Flipzoids is an appropriation of two words.
	   The first is `Flip', which is derogatory American for us.
Filipinos are called Flips in the US, and `Flips' actually means
F---ing Little Island People. `Zoids' come from schizoids. This is
jumbling three agendas together. It's cultural and psychological
and schizophrenia. `Flip' and `zoids.' ``This play will shatter
myths. Not just one, but several. This is a multi-layered play,
we're not cut black and white here, we're exploring gray areas of
what it means to be Americans, and as Fil-Ams specifically.''
	   Pea cautions to add, however, ``In Flipzoids, we're not
presenting archetypes here that generalize the whole experience.
Flipzoids presents three unique individuals who go through a
journey and they speak directly to the experience of assimilation.
But we're not out to say, `This is what being Fil-American means.'
But rather, this is an experience of a Fil-Am.
	   ``Because this Fil-Am theater aesthetic is a nascent form, the
most prevalent theme now is assimilation. No Fil-Am theater company
has really explored that yet, whereas most other ethnic theater
groups have written about blending into the American mainstream for
years and years. So now all the Fil-Am playwrights are talking
about blending into the American society, of an outsider blending
in, which is what Flipzoids is all about.
	   Predominantly, Fil-Am writers are writing about having to blend
into American society.''
	   All the Ma-Yi members would certainly have their own unique
experiences concerning integration and assimilation -- and finding
and affirming one's self -- in an adapted culture. Pea was born in
the Philippines, grew up as a child in the US, returned to the
Philippines during his high school to college years, graduated from
the University of the Philippines, then finally returned to the US
for good. An active member of two UP theater companies, he was
awarded a Birch Foundation Fellowship to study at Circle in the
Square Professional Actor's School in New York City. He counted
among his classmates thespians like Michael Moriarty, Joanna
Gleason, and Maria Tucci. As an actor, he appeared in Tomorrow was
War directed by Vanessa Redgrave, Three Sisters, and Our Town,
among others.
	   Asked to define a ``true Fil-Am identity,'' Pea answers, ``It's
multi-faceted. As it is, Filipinos are a hodge-podge of different
psyches.
	   Influences from Spain, America, and all these things. Then add
to all that is the idea of having to blend into American society,
which kind of creates this multi-faceted thing, which is a problem
for our community.
	   Because if you look at the US, you'll see how ethnic groups have
sort of formed community centers and cultural centers. We Fil-Ams
don't have that.
	   We don't have a `Filipino-town' [as in Chinatown] in the US. San
Francisco is our closest to an idea of a Fil-Am community, but
elsewhere we like to blend. We don't like to stick out.''
	   He emphasizes, ``By appropriating our stories and putting them
on stage in some way, we validate what we are as Americans. This is
who we are and it's OK to be who we are, we can be who we are in
this country and still be part of America. We don't have to be
white. We don't have to re-invent ourselves to be white. We don't
have to compromise to be Americans. We don't have to forget that we
are Filipinos. We don't have to hide our cultural
uniqueness/eccentricities. We blend in. There's room for everybody.
That's the point.''
	   That point, hopefully, will get across to the Manila audience as
powerfully as it did to the Fil-Am community. Pena mentions the
possibility of bringing in more Fil-Am plays into Manila in the
future. One example is Chris Millado's Periginasyon, loosely based
on America's in the Heart written by Carlos Bulosan. Another plan
is to set up a six-month exchange internship program, wherein
Filipino artists would go to the US, and vice-versa.
	   Flipzoids is Ma-Yi's first presentation in Manila. It need not
be the last.

Corretja, Pioline advance to men's semifinals 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Pioline advancing to semifinals
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Frenchman Cedric Pioline became the only
non-Spaniard in the men's semifinals of the French Open, battling
through five exhausting sets Wednesday to defeat Hicham Arazi.
	   As French flags waved in the stands, Pioline broke the
Moroccan's serve for a 4-2 lead in the final set and then held on _
fighting off a break point in the last game _ for the victory.
	   Pioline's 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win put him in the
semifinals with Spaniards Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya and Felix
Mantilla.
	   The Pioline-Arazi match was 3 hours, 42 minutes of error-filled,
often tedious tennis _ the two players combined for 149 unforced
errors. But French fans hardly seemed to notice, yelling ``Oui'' on
his points and booing loudly when Arazi questioned line calls.
	   Corretja reached his first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating
Filip Dewulf of Belgium 7-5, 6-4, 6-3, joining close friends Moya
and Mantilla in the final four.
	   ``This is history,'' Corretja said. ``I think it's really good
because normally it's not easy to have a country put three guys in
the semis of a Grand Slam. We used to see the American guys in
other tournaments, but not the Spanish guys.''
	   Deuwlf hadn't lost a set until his straight-set loss to
Corretja. The 39th-ranked Belgian was a semifinalist at Roland
Garros last year.
	   On Tuesday, No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios went the way of the other
top seeds in Paris. He was upset in four sets by Moya, losing his
chance to regain the No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   The Chilean held that spot for a month earlier this year, and
could have reclaimed it with a quarterfinal victory.
	   But at least one player remains on course _ Martina Hingis. The
undisputed best woman player defeated Venus Williams on Tuesday
with such ease that it put to rest any talk of a great rivalry _ at
least for now.
	   Hingis next faces a newly inspired Monica Seles, a three-time
champion in Paris, in one of Thursday's semifinals. No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport plays two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
other.
	   With Davenport and Seles advancing, there are two American women
in the French Open semifinals for the first time since Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert in 1987.
	   But there were no echoes of Evert and Navratilova when Hingis
and Williams took the court. In a swirling wind that hampered both
players, Hingis used her deft touch and uncanny court sense to
dictate play.
	   Never in the 6-3, 6-4 victory did the Swiss star appear out of
control, off-balance or rushed. Williams hurt her cause with 38
unforced errors.
	   ``I don't think I was as patient as I should have been. I guess
everyone knows I like to hit,'' Williams said. ``I suppose I got a
little too excited, really wanted to hit a winner.''
	   Hingis came into the match with a 5-2 career record against the
eighth-seeded Williams, but the two 17-year-olds were 2-2 this
year.
	   The match promised to be an intriguing battle between power and
smarts. But, just as in their only previous Grand Slam tournament
encounter _ a 6-0, 6-4 win by Hingis in the U.S. Open final last
summer _ the match turned into a one-sided affair.
	   ``It's probably good for me to lose so I can really see what I'm
doing wrong and really look at myself and say, `Venus, you're not
there,''' she said.
	   Moya, the No. 12 seed who has been ranked as as high as fifth,
is hoping to crack back into the top 10 this week.
	   He became the talk of tennis at last year's Australian Open _
for his dashing looks and talent. He upset defending champion Boris
Becker in the first round, then went to the final, losing to
Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old had never gone
past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And at Roland
Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two previous
visits.
	   Now Moya is the highest seed left. On Friday he faces Mantilla.
	   ``We're going to be friends until Friday,'' he said. ``When we
get to the court, I will try to kill him.''
	   Tuesday's play ended with Gustavo Kuerten, the defending
champion who lost in the second round, disqualified from doubles.
He threw his racket at the chair umpire, hitting a fan in the
stands, but apparently not causing injury.
	   ``I'm so sorry for what happened and I regret what I did,'' the
Brazilian said today. ``I know that this will make me a more mature
guy and will make me grow. I want to make it clear that I never had
the intention of hurting anyone on or off the court.''

	   MULTI-HEADED WEIGHING SCALES. Agricultural produce can be
weighed faster and more accurately with Elpack Packaging Systems'
newly-upgraded ``Goren''
	   series of computerized, multiple-head weighing systems. Designed
to work in line with high speed, automatic packing machines, the
new GRS models are powered by multi-step motors instead of air
pistons.
	   This means no external air supply is needed, and machine speed
can be controlled at every stage. Maximum speed is faster and the
machines are also quieter than earlier models. Due to the new
design, all major parts are enclosed in a housing, making cleaning
easier.
	   The series is controlled by advanced micro-computers, designed
especially for high accuracy and speed, even with problematic
products. It does not discharge under-weights. The system can also
be programmed in any language, unlike its competitors.
	   The ``Goren'' series is suitable for all items, including
carrots, radishes, prunes, dates and cherry tomatoes. Two basic
models are available at weighing speeds of up to 65 fruits/minute
and 95 fruits/minute. Both models have weighing ranges of up to one
kilogram and weighing accuracy of 0.5 grams. - Agritech Israel 2ND
PHILSURIN GUIDELINES. The Mill District Development Council (MDDC)
is offering soil analysis to its district planters as part of the
Philippine Sugar Research Institute Foundation, Inc. (Philsurin)
extension services.
	   Planters may submit composite soil samples immediately to the
Philsurin coordinators in their respective mill districts, said
Philsurin Director-General Leon M. Arceo.
	   As a follow-up to ``Farm Practices That Can Alleviate the Impact
of Drought on Sugarcane,'' the first series of leaflets released by
the private-led research institute, it has come up with a second
series of instructional publications entitled ``Soil Sampling
Guidelines for Soil Analysis.''
	   Thousands of sugar district planters have received copies of the
seven-page leaflet no. 2 which will update them on latest soil
sampling guidelines for soil analysis in relation to fertilizer and
lime recommendations.
	   ``We simplify our leaflets and make them highly-illustrated or
in pictorial sequences for effective dissemination of information,
skills and techniques to our target-audiences,'' Arceo explained.
	   Meanwhile, Kananga Parish Priest Fr. Generoso Sevilla and Arceo
led recently the blessing and turnover of a greenhouse to Ormoc's
MDDC. Ormoc MDDC Vice Chair Teofilo Fran received the symbolic key
to the modern greenhouse facility as part of Philsurin's
contribution to upgrading the RD thrusts of sugarcane mill
districts nationwide, through private-led initiatives involving the
academe and the science and technology sectors of the sugar
industry 1ST AGROTEX. Agricultural technologies will be the
highlight of Pcarrd's presentation during the upcoming
international Agricultural Technology Exposition (AGROTEX) on June
4-7, 1998 at the World Trade Center, Pasay City.
	   Being the national council for RD in agriculture, Pcarrd was
invited to participate in the first-ever international exposition.
Agrotex aims to introduce new and advanced technologies, processes,
modern equipment, and products and services that would enhance and
improve efficiency, productivity, and profitability.
	   Agrotex hopes to gather all industry stakeholders in both local
and international scenes in a single venue.
	   Pcarrd will showcase technologies generated by its consortia in
the regions: the mango hot water treatment (HWT), rotary flash
dryer, high pressure sap displacement method, and the cashew
processing technologies.
	   The mango HWT technology was developed by the Postharvest
Horticulture and Training Research Center (PHTRC) at the University
of the Philippines-Los Baos. HWT is an effective postharvest
treatment for carabao mangoes. It helps remove latex, sooty molds,
and dirt on mangoes' surface.
	   The rotary flash dryer, on the other hand, is a technology
developed by the Forest Products Research and Development Institute
(FPRDI)-DOST. It is designed for multistage partial drying of wet
palay through heat. It rapidly dries palay and has better milling
recovery.
	   The high pressure sap displacement treatment of bamboo poles is
another technology developed by FPRDI for rural areas. The method
produces acceptable quality bamboo poles, cheap, with minimal
treating time required. The technology comes with the treating
equipment that is portable and easy to operate.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to promote cashew as an emerging export
winner are being intensified. Pcarrd, in partnership with its
consortium in Region 4, the Southern Tagalog Agriculture and
Resources Research and Development Consortium (Starrdec), is
enhancing promotional efforts on cashew technologies. One such
effort is the processing of cashew into several products like
candies, wine, jelly, and vinegar.
	   Through Agrotex, Pcarrd hopes to further accelerate the adoption
of these technologies.
	   For further inquiries on other PCARRD-monitored/coordinated
technologies, write or call: Dr. William D. Dar, executive
director, Pcarrd. E-mail address: wdd  ultra.pcarrd.dost.gov.ph;

	   HONG KONG stocks closed slightly lower yesterday after
recovering from a big futures-lead drop in early trading, dealers
said.
	   The key Hang Seng Index ended down 13.84 points at 8,598.17,
well off its lows for the day. Total turnover was HK$5.52 billion.
	   Dealers said sentiment was poor due to concern over the local
economy and fears that weakness in the yen will lead to another
round of competitive currency depreciations in Asia.
	   But they said reports that the Group of Seven industrialised
nations would meet this week to discuss the yen provided some
support to the market.
	   Chief secretary Anson Chan told investors to have faith in the
Government's 7-point economic stimulus plan announced Friday.

	   Leader of the Opposition Begum Khaleda Zia yesterday accused the
government of gagging the press to fulfil its political designs.
	   ``The government has stopped giving advertisements to the
opposition newspapers,'' she said and also mentioned that it had
shut down four trust papers rendering over 500 journalists jobless.
	   ``Many of the journalists were thrown out of their profession
for political reasons'' she told a meeting of the Bangladesh Photo
Journalists Association (BPA).
	   The association organised the function at its auditorium this
afternoon on the occasion of its 12th founding anniversary.
	   The BNP Chairperson said publication of some newspapers became
uncertain due to stoppage of government advertisements.
	   ``The dissident photo journalists are also being harassed by the
government,'' she alleged, saying ``autocrats cannot tolerate free
expression.''
	   Begum Zia hoped that journalists would continue to play their
role in projecting the truth ignoring the problems they are facing.
	   She demanded of the government to look into the problems of
journalists, particularly the photo journalists.
	   The former Prime Minister said her government had showed due
honour to the journalists.
	   The meeting, chaired by BPA President M Salahuddin, was also
addressed by Jatiya Press Club President Reazuddin Ahmed and BPA
General Secretary AKM Mohsin.
	   Earlier, Begum Zia distributed BPA awards among four photo
journalists - late Manu Munshi, Quamruzzaman, Rafiqur Rahman and
Wase Ansari.

French stunt climber scales Warsaw skyscraper

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw's Marriott hotel proved to be an
easy target for stunt climber Alain Robert, who avoided security
agents Wednesday and scaled the 41-story glass tower using only his
bare hands.
	   Robert, dubbed the Spiderman for his worldwide exploits, climbed
up to the roof of the 146-meter hotel in about 20 minutes. Upon
reaching the top, he was detained by police.
	   After his first attempt on Tuesday was foiled, Robert kept his
plan secret and did not inform the media of the attempt.
	   On Tuesday, police and security agents prevented Robert from
making the stunt and stopped him when he appeared on the roof of a
shopping center surrounding the hotel.
	   Robert, 35, of Valance, France, makes his living scaling tall
buildings as publicity stunts. He uses only his bare hands and no
cords or rigging.
	   He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the world's
fifth-tallest _ the Empire State Building in New York City.
	   Robert, making his first appearance in eastern Europe, was
invited by a Polish company that makes climbing gear.

	   ``Pay your just and fair share of taxes, because this is your
duty, and because your taxes will be spent well,'' said incoming
President Joseph Estrada at a recent meeting with business leaders.
One of the highlights of Estrada's 10-point agenda is a strong
stance against tax evasion, particularly by big businesses and
``fat cats'' who are thought to have long been cheating the system.
Amnesties will be granted to accelerate collection of past due
taxes, but after that, tax evaders are told, they will be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
	   Finance Secretary-designate Edgardo Espiritu further disclosed a
plan to assign government examiners to monitor financial operations
of the country's major corporations. The monitoring scheme would
include utilizing records from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Insurance Securities Commission, Department of Trade
and Industry, Board of Investments, Credit Information Bureaus, and
various private sector sources. Espiritu said, ``this action is
designed to remove the policy of discretion on the part of
examiners so that there can be no under-the-table transactions.''
	   Tax remittances from the country's top 10 firms during the first
three months suffered a steep drop of 33.5% to P2.113 billion from
P2.598 billion recorded during the same period last year, according
to a government report. This represents a 43.3% under-achievement
against the target set by the Department of Finance and the IMF.
	   Major corporations account for 43.6% of annual tax collection.
While the economic setback was one cause for the sharp decline in
fiscal revenue, nobody can deny the possibility that the country's
blue chip companies shortchanged the national government.
	   While making allowance for the effects of the slowdown in the
country's economy, a ranking Finance official in an interview with
The Business Daily nevertheless said tax evasion was suspected to
be another major reason for the revenue shortfall. Are top flight
corporations having pangs of conscience? How disgraceful it would
be if they were actually trying to feather their own nests without
regard to public duties and obligations! In the world's more mature
economies, tax evasion is a serious crime entailing heavy
punishment as well as societal sanctions. How many tax dodgers are
serving time in prison in the Philippines? The new administration
should indeed tighten supervision of major tax payers' obligations.
	   The Ramos administration tried to balance fiscal budgets by
simply auctioning off one state asset after another in the name of
privatization, while doing next to nothing to scrutinize or
prosecute flagrant cases of tax evasion. The idea obviously was not
to rub big business the ``wrong way.''
	   With an overwhelming public mandate behind him, ``Robin Hood''
Estrada is expected to crack down on tax evaders with an iron fist.
Once a case has been established, the names of large scale culprits
should be published.
	   Once convicted, hefty penalties could then serve as an effective
deterrent to others. Consumers could be called on to boycott the
products and services provided by tax cheaters.
	   Why be so fussy about taxes? Evading taxes is not just unfair to
honest citizens, but it is largely responsible for public sector
deficits. In order to cover the deficit, government is forced to
borrow money by issuing Treasury Bills. The larger the need of
government for money, the higher the rates are that it has to pay
to its creditors. The law of supply and demand sees to that. That
again results in a higher benchmark rate which banks use to
determine the interest they charge when lending money to among
others -- you and me! What happens if banks start charging
prohibitively high interest rates of 30%? It is a devastating
damper on business activity. At such loan shark levels, only the
very privileged, the very smart and the very crooked can make
money. Balanced budgets are possible, however, if government cuts
spending. That is easier said than done and usually results in cuts
in areas where spending is needed most, e.g., basic infrastructure,
social welfare services, among others.
	   As the economy is slowing, raising taxes is definitely out for a
``populist''
	   administration. Under Erapnomics, sufficient revenue must be
secured by increasing tax collection. How the incoming president
deals with the issue would be a first litmus test to measure his
seriousness in pursuing a hard-line policy. Should he succumb to
the allure of traditional politics, disenchanted masses might turn
their back on him. Mr. Estrada himself reminded business leaders
the other day that it was his job to level the playing field by
enforcing the rules.
	   I've heard the tale of a famous Spanish-Filipino tycoon who was
refused a visa to Japan several years ago. The Japanese Embassy
turned down his visa application because his tax record showed an
annual income that was deemed insufficient. A certain
Chinese-Filipino business magnate is well-known for his
anti-disclosure stance with regard to his company's financial
situation. He has long opted for paying fines instead.
	   Respectable corporate citizenship should be promoted. While
Ramos is credited with turning the economy around, his pro-business
stance pampered corporate interests. An Estrada administration is
expected to fulfill the dual functions necessary for the nation's
economic progress by being both driver and regulator.
	   Another daunting task for Estrada is the abolition of the
so-called ``pork barrel'' fund. Each congressman is entitled to a
share of the Countrywide Development Fund of at least P12.5 million
per year for various projects in his/her constituency. Senators
enjoy an annual lard-scoop of a least P18 million. In addition,
there is more pork to be accessed from the Congressional Initiative
Allocation funds given to various agencies.
	   Legislators have the power to direct how, where and when these
particular appropriations are to be disbursed.
	   ``Pork and Other Perks'' by the Philippine Center of
Investigative Journalism indicates that senior committee chairs
have a final say on CIAs worth P100 million a year. No wonder
candidates have millions to spend in campaigns.
	   This is a huge vested interest on the part of congressmen and
senators and the last thing they would want to part with. It is
reported that except for a few, even Lammp members are for the pork
barrel. Mr. Estrada announced that he would do away with the pork,
once installed in Malacaang, but some believe it would be a
quixotical attempt, much like fighting windmills. For Mr. Estrada,
it is an uphill battle to rewrite legislation against so much
opposition. What would be his game plan? A presidential decree? He
proposes to transfer the appropriation jurisdiction directly to
local governments.
	   Cynics retort, ``what if local governments are corrupt?''
	   Pointed out is the malpractice in the Department of Public Works
and Highways, where kickbacks for high ranking officials are said
to be worth more than 30% of project cost, a far cry from the 15%
during the notorious Marcos era. No institutional or legislative
reform seems fit to eradicate the misuse and abuse of public funds
supposed to be used for the facilitation of provincial development.
One way to ensure effective and appropriate use of these funds is
to set up an oversight committee. Putting in place this kind of
monitoring mechanism would help reduce arbitrary misappropriation
and wastage. The committee in each locality could be composed of
citizens representing various sectors. Hongkong has an independent
law enforcement agency against graft and corruption among public
servants. Legislatures are elected to make laws, while the
bureaucracy is to administrate. Thus, pork barrel should be
abolished once and for all. But that's not enough. We need to have
an agency under the direct supervision of the President to exercise
stringent surveillance over the conduct of government officials.
The Ramos administration was very lax in this respect, to say the
least. As not much is expected from appealing to the conscience of
publicservants, the only alternative is something more painful than
slapping their wrists. Chances are that severe punishment would
effectively reduce temptation for graft and corruption. But this
kind of get-tough approach can never be a sure winner. Strict rules
should be accompanied by the incentives. We need to establish an
impartial evaluation system for government workers.
	   Those achieving higher scores should be rewarded with
substantially higher salaries and promotions, while redundancies
are rigorously shed. Decent stipends for qualified government
workers permit them to be less dependent on kickbacks and
under-the-table commissions. Poverty dulls the sense of honor and
dignity. Paying meager salaries and demanding high moral standards
is simply asking too much. Mr. Estrada's challenge is daunting.
	   Any one of his avowed tasks is a tall order. But the people will
rally behind him if he really tries as good as he can to make
dramatic changes in the way our society functions.

At least 70 dead in high-speed German train crash buses 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: ADDS details of ICE model, RESTORES reference to Red Cross
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 70 people and
seriously injuring 200 as car after car of the train crumpled into
the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear. Police spokesman
Joachim Lindenberg said it appeared that the impact of the train
collapsed the overpass, sending an auto parked on the structure
plunging to the tracks.
	   The auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the
tracks, Lindenberg told German television ARD. He said that anyone
that close to the accident could not have survived. Deutsche Bahn
did not immediately confirm that account.
	   Earlier reports, based on witness accounts to authorities,
suggested that the auto had plunged into the train causing it to
derail.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while
the cars derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   At least 13 cars derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed the
cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. Survivors were taken to
hospitals throughout the region. The Red Cross had chartered six
buses to take most of the uninjured to Hamburg, spokesman Harald
Krueger said.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991.
	   A 1967 rail accident near Magdeburg in then-East Germany, killed
94 people in the deadliest rail accident since World War II. A
crossing barrier closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline,
causing it to explode and spreading fire into passenger cars.
	   The worst accident in western Germany was in 1971, when a train
carrying children on a field trip collided with a freight train,
killing 46 people.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 800 rescue workers were at the scene, including trauma
surgeons andear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The train that crashed Wednesday was a first-generation ICE
model powered by two electric-powered locomotives pulling up to 14
passenger cars with a capacity of 759 passengers. At top speed the
train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to an emergency
stop.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

	   BNP leaders yesterday charged the government with changing the
nomination of their MPs to different parliamentary standing
committees by violating the 4-point accord. They demanded that the
committees should be reconstituted.
	   Addressing a hurriedly-called news conference, Prof. Badruddoza
Chowdhury, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said, ``the government
was destroying the future of parliamentary democracy by violating
the 4-point accord signed on March 2, 1998''.
	   He said the BNP would be compelled to take follow-up steps if
the government failed to fulfil the demand. The demands were also
conveyed to Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury by a letter yesterday,
he said.
	   Khondker Delwar Hossain, Chief Whip of the opposition, read out
a 3-page statement at the news conference held at the Minto Road
official residence of the Leader of the Opposition. Prof.
Badruddoza Chowdhury replied to questions. MPs Alamgir Kabir and
Nazimuddin Alam were present.
	   Responding to a question, Prof. Chowdhury said a decision about
the BNP's return to the ensuing budget session would be taken at a
meeting of the BNP Parliamentary Party before the June 9 long
march.
	   Alleging violation of the 4-point accord, he said the government
did not ensure equal and objective television coverage of the
proceedings of Parliament. The treasury bench was given more time
at the cost of the opposition. Distorted news was covered by the
Radio after stopping the live broadcast of the proceedings, he
said.
	   He said that none of the cases filed against BNP leaders with
political motives had been withdrawn even though the deadline to
withdraw the cases was March 31; and that neither Manik Mian Avenue
nor Panthapath had been reopened for political meetings.
	   The formation of the 35 Standing Committees of Parliament was
completed on 12 May when the MPs belonging to the BNP were
abstaining from the house.
	   Prof. Chowdhury alleged that the government had changed the
BNP's nomination to at least 12 of the 35 standing committees and
included the BNP members in those arbitrarily. He mentioned the
name of MK Anwar who has not been included in the Standing
Committee on the Establishment Ministry. Fourteen Committees
constituted earlier with BNP's representation had also not been
reconstituted properly, he alleged.
	   In the written statement, Khondker Delwar Hossain said some
parliamentary committees formed by the Speaker and some other
committees formed at the instance of the Chief Whip, Abul Hasnat
Abdullah, had also not been reconstituted in keeping with the
4-point accord even after the Chief Whip of the Opposition had
written letters in early April.
	   He said the BNP's proportionate share of members in the 35
standing committees (having ten members each) on ministries was
120. However, for the sake of understanding, the BNP had accepted a
share of 113 members and accordingly the 4-point accord was signed.
However, the BNP was given a share of only 110 members of these
committees. This was a violation of the accord, he opined.
	   According to him, the committees in which BNP members had been
included in violation of the party nomination include the
committees those on the ministries of Home Affairs, Establishment,
Textiles, Civil Aviation and Tourism, Energy and Mineral Resources,
Housing and Public Works, Commerce, Education, Disaster Management
and Relief and Land.
	   The BNP leaders complained that the Speaker who was the
initiator of and a signatory to the 4-point accord had failed to
play a constructive and neutral role. They alleged that the Speaker
had deprived the BNP MPs of their right to participate in the
general discussion on the CHT agreement. The 4-point accord by the
government and the failure of the Speaker to run Parliament
impartially have made the future of parliamentary democracy
uncertain, they alleged.

	   KUALA Lumpur shares rebounded after seven days of consecutive
falls to close marginally higher on thin trading yesterday.
	   Buying interest on selective blue-chips helped to push the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) key barometer into positive territory
in early morning trade.
	   Early gains were trimmed later in the morning as some market
players were seen selling index-linked stocks to lock in profits.
	   Analysts said shares opened higher after Bank Negara announced
that it will continue to maintain interest rates at current levels.
	   ``Interest rate policy continues to aim to balance the need to
maintain price stability and a stable exchange rate while ensuring
that productive activity is not undermined,'' said Bank Negara in a
statement.
	   Analysts said despite the central bank's announcement, any
rebound on the bourse is expected to be shortlived as there are
still concerns on the contracting economy and corporate earnings.
	   The KLCI closed marginally higher by 2.61 points to 520.61
compared with Monday's close of 518.00.
	   The KLSE's Second Board closed 0.66-point higher to 110.49 while
the broader-based Emas Index inched up 0.76-point to close at
133.01.
	   The scoreboard showed gainers outpacing losers 329 to 205 with
203 counters remaining unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries gained 0.69 to 126.28 while the
30-share New Straits Industrial Index 0.24 point to close at
3,069.22.
	   On the KLSE total turnover yesterday amounted to 111.150 million
shares valued at RM246.766 billion.
	   Maybank was the most active counter with 17.3 million shares,
followed by United Engineers (Malaysia) with 5.08 million shares
traded and Sime Darby with 4.26 million shares changing hands.

	   The US-Bangladesh Business Council (USBBC), a newly formed forum
for promotion of bilateral trade and investment, meets Wednesday in
Washington.
	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed left here for
Washington DC Monday night to attend the maiden session of the
USBBC.
	   At least 20 potential US companies, like AES, American
International Group, Halliburton, Occidental, Union Texas
Petroleum, UNOCAL, Gulf Resources, Coastal Power and Bechtel, are
founder members of the council.
	   The minister is leading a five-member delegation. Its members
are chief whip Abul Hasnat Abdullah, Deputy Minister for Shipping
Saber Hossain Chowdhury, FBCCI President Yussuf Abdullah Harun and
BGMEA President Mostafa Golam Quddus.
	   Tofail Ahmed will be the keynote speaker at the inaugural
meeting of the USBBC, officials said.
	   The forum aims at promoting US investment in Bangladesh,
strengthening US-Bangladesh relations and facilitating a continuing
dialogue between Bangladesh and American business leaders.
	   It will also create enthusiasm among the potential new members
of USBBC who are making decisions regarding their investment in
Bangladesh, the officials hope.
	   Before departure, the Commerce and Industries Minister said:
``This inaugural meeting is a historic event as it marks the
beginning of this new organisation aimed at highlighting Bangladesh
as an investment destination for American corporations''.
	   The minister will also have meetings with Congressmen and
Senators and the officials of US State Department.
	   Tofail will address the US business leaders in New York. He is
expected to return to Dhaka on June 7.

	   KLSE Composite Index Futures traded on the Kuala Lumpur Options
and Financial Futures Exchange (KLoffe) ended the day higher on
short-covering of the spot month by retail players.
	   Some foreign players were seen selling futures on continued
concerns over the country's shrinking economy and corporate
profits.
	   Spot month June ended 5.5 points higher to close at 514.5 with
2,515 lots transacted, while July futures ended 1.1 points higher
to settle at 503.1 with 153 lots traded.
	   Open interest for spot June stood at 16,752 lots while open
interest for July stood at 167 lots.
	   The bearish outlook on the country's economy, weakening ringgit
and regional factors were expected to limit any upward movements of
both the futures and cash market.

	   After a market correction for a short period on Monday, the
Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) became buoyant Tuesday.
	   According to the stock experts, quick bouncing back of the
market on the gaining track is a positive gesture towards the
stable market.
	   The firmer trading with declined turnover gave rise in share
prices in general.
	   The rise of the share prices reflected in the market barometer
by an increase of 2.21 per cent or by 13.57 points.
	   The All Share Price Index of the day stood at 627.42 points
against 613.67 points on the previous day.
	   The market capitalisation rose by Taka 1.22 billion. The total
amount stood at Taka 56.41 billion from previous day's Taka 55.19
billion.
	   A total of 124 securities changed hands on Tuesday. Of them,
gainers increased to 100 and losers reduced to 23.
	   Volume of the day marked a marginal rise by 1676 shares and
debentures to 3,88,492 shares and debentures.
	   The value marked a fall by Taka 2.52 million to day's Taka 34.57
million.
	   Prominent gainers of the day for trading the single share were:
Singer Bangladesh Ltd by Taka 115.95, Apex Foods Ltd by Taka 78.87,
Amam Sea Food Industries Ltd by Taka 78.30, Bangladesh Lamps Ltd by

	   A SIMILAR occurrence to the 1980s collapse of 24 deposit-taking
cooperatives (DTC) may be the bitter medicine that Malaysia needs
to swallow to turn around the economy, said Hanifah, Teo 
Associates chairman Datuk Hanifah Noordin.
	   He was speaking at a conference on credit credibility and
financial distress, organised by Mentor Centre for Business
Research Sdn Bhd.
	   Hanifah added that the economy had not bottomed out yet.
	   ``A lot of corporate results are not out yet and there is a lot
of delay in these. We should be expecting some more bad news,'' he
added.
	   He also said regional problems had not manifested itself fully,
citing Indonesia as an example.
	   Hanifah said that until the collapse of the 24 DTCs - the first
real sign of recession - there appeared to be a lack of urgency in
the general public's approach towards the recession.
	   ``It appeared that the urgency of bottoming out of the (1980s)
recession was greatly enhanced by the experience (DTC collapse),''
he said.
	   The authorities acted timely over the DTCs, Hanifah said, adding
that they successfully steered the economy back on track.
	   He said that although the sign of the times affected businesses
in the 1980s, the excesses of business administrators and the
vagaries of the businesses themselves were the main causes of the
downfall.
	   ``If anything, these excesses and vagaries, born out of greed,
were the catalyst for the economic downturn of the 1980s.''
	   He also pointed out that some auditors currently go in a
roundabout manner to inform shareholders that the accounts are
qualified.
	   Even though the companies assessed are their clients, auditors
should be firm with their customers, Hanifah said.

	   POST-consumer waste in plastics is a problem facing Malaysian
plastics manufacturers as a result of the increasing use of
plastics in packaging and post-consumer products.
	   Plastic packaging and post-consumer products constitute between
10 and 15 per cent of Malaysia's solid waste, said Department of
Environment (DOE) director-general Rosnani Ibrahim in her speech at
the seminar on ``Towards a Better Understanding of Waste Management
in Malaysia'' in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   She said based on a report by the WorldWide Fund for Nature,
Malaysia is expected to generate seven million tonnes of solid
waste by the year 2000 compared to 5.5 million tonnes in 1995.
	   ``This is equivalent to 19,000 tonnes generated daily in the
year 2000 compared to 13,500 tonnes in 1995,'' she said, adding
that daily per capita waste generation will stand at 0.7kg.
	   She added that based on a study by the US Environmental
Protection Agency, plastics constitute a large part of packaging,
that is, 10 per cent by weight and 20 per cent by volume.
	   Plastics have become a significant part of consumers' daily
lives as they are used widely in car parts and household items.
	   ``The question is where will these plastics finally end up.
Therefore there is a need to look at ways to better manage waste,''
she said, adding that consumers themselves have to change their
habits and lifestyle towards plastic consumption.
	   Chairman of the organising committee for the seminar, Mr Thye
Hong Kuen said industrial waste and post-consumer waste are two
areas of waste management faced by plastics manufacturers.
	   He said as a result of competition and the need to have
efficient and cost-effective products, manufacturers are constantly
looking for ways to produce plastics with better properties and
strength.
	   Turnover of manufactured plastics stood at RM6 billion last
year, he said, adding that it will augur well for the industry if 1
per cent of this amount could be spent on research and development.
	   Earlier in her speech, Rosnani said since 1995, work has begun
on the review of the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste)
Regulations 1989 to improve its implementation.
	   ``Among the areas being reviewed include the list of scheduled
wastes which will enable all parties concerned with their handling
to have a clear understanding of the categories of wastes as
covered in the legislation,'' she said.
	   This she added, will avoid any ambiguity that may arise, for
example, while plastic products turned into wastes are not
considered hazardous wastes, uncured resin from a resin
manufacturing plant is categorised as one and must be appropriately
handled under this law.
	   The review of the scheduled wastes list is also in line with the
Basel Convention's new list.
	   She said the review was taking some time as there is a need to
look at the new wastes being generated which are not on the current
list.

	   THE journey of life can be described as a series of mountains
and valleys.
	   Mountains are obstacles and challenges while valleys are moments
of achievement as these obtacles are conquered and overcome.
	   Thus, like any journey, when one conquers a mountain and reaches
the other side of a valley, the mountain ahead is always higher.
	   Three time Wimbledon champion and TAG Heuer's new ambassador
Boris Becker expressed this sentiment recently when he launched the
new advertising campaign for TAG Heuer, Inner Strength.
	   And Mr Edouard Malbois, General Manager of TAG Heuer Malaysia
echoed this sentiment when he said inner strength is about mental
values.
	   ``One has to find inner strength to overcome problems and
obstacles and it is important then to believe that mental values
are more important than physical values,'' he said at the launch in
Kuala Lumpur last week.
	   He added that with Inner Strength, TAG Heuer takes a daring step
inward into the essence of sports and sporting excellence, into the
mind that is.
	   ``Inner strength is a universal concept. I believe it is the
single most important component to success ... be it the success of
a champion, a brand or a business,'' he said.
	   TAG Heuer is no stranger to avant-garde forms of communication
given its advertisement ``Don't Crack Under Pressure'' which
featured Formula One driver Aryton Senna and ``Success, It's a Mind
Game''.
	   To personify the spirit of Inner Strength, TAG Heuer's new
campaign features 11 top-class athletes, all of whom exhibit an
extraordinary reserve of inner strength in overcoming obstacles to
achieve the exceptional levels of success and victories in their
respective fields of sports.
	   Becker joins the list of athletes chosen by TAG Heuer to
illustrate its new advertising campaign. Other athletes include
Leonardo and Colin Jackson.
	   Featuring Becker takes on two-fold implications, firstly, it
highlights that TAG Heuer continues to build partnerships with
successful athletes and also because Becker represents the epitome
of inner strength.
	   He is legendary not only for his strong tennis skills, but for
his outstanding mental strength that saw him win his first
Wimbledon title in 1985, making him the youngest winner, said
Malbois.
	   Becker himself said,'' The difference between winning and losing
in major championships is your mind, your concentration and in your
whole approach to that important game, and that comes from your
brain.''
	   ``There are many difficult moments on the court ... there are
moments when I double fault, and this is when I have to search deep
within myself to find inner strength.
	   ``And I find that this campaign fits so well with my character
and personality,'' he said.
	   On the campaign, Malbois said it will begin in July and will be
for the print medium. The investment in Malaysia, he said is
between RM300,000 to RM400,000.
	   ``It is not a tactical campaign and as such will run for one or
two years,'' he said adding that the aim of the campaign is to
associate the brand with key players in sports.
	   ``For a long time TAG Heuer was considered as a brand that is
not human enough and it was difficult for people to associate
themselves with the brand,'' he said.
	   He added that through the campaign, present and potential
customers will be able to identify with the strength is
characterised by the make of the watch.
	   ``We believe in excellence and the importance of being in
control where the high standard that is asscociated with TAG Heuer
watches is ensured at all times,'' he said.
	   As the campaign features top-class athletes, this again
reinforces TAG Heuer as a prestigious sports watch.
	   ``We do not want to dilute the image and we want to remain a
prestigious sports watch as we have since 1860 where we are at the
top of the segment,'' he said adding that the campaign in itself
will reflect the ``true pedigree'' of the brand.
	   Apart from print advertisements, TAG Heuer is also developing a
local venture for televison and cinema, said Malbois.
	   ``This is aimed at reaching and talking to more Malaysians,'' he
said adding that its launch planned to coincide with the World Cup
Finals this month.

	   LOCAL furniture makers must now break the chain of manufacturing
lower-end products and start tapping the lucrative higher-end
furniture markets of developed countries.
	   Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said
this chain has prevented the local furniture sector from exploiting
the world furniture market that was worth some RM177 billion last
year.
	   ``One way Malaysia can make a headway in high-end markets is by
manufacturing designer furniture,'' he told reporters after opening
a one-day national seminar on ``Product Finishing Using Ultra
Violet/Electron Beam Technology'' in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Lim said he had directed the Malaysian Timber Industry Council
to engage reputable international furniture designers to assist
locals in designing furniture with Malaysian characteristics.
	   He noted that there is considerable scope for the Malaysian
furniture sector to increase its exports, given the fact that the
industry has attained international standards in terms of quality
and finishing.
	   Lim said although Malaysian-made furniture had received
international recognition, it was only catering for the
low-and-medium-end of the global furniture market.
	   ``We should aim to see our furniture displayed and sold in
places like High Point in the US and Harrods of London,'' he said,
adding that the sector should focus on the higher-end furniture
market as it is bigger and more lucrative.
	   ``This is the only way Malaysia can capture niche and
competitive markets in the US, Europe and Japan.''
	   Lim also said West Asia is a big potential market for Malaysia,
judging from its good response during the Malaysian International
Furniture Fair (MIFF) held in March this year.
	   On the country's furniture exports, he said Malaysia is
optimistic of exporting RM3.5 billion worth of furniture in 1998
after having achieved exports of RM2.6 billion last year.
	   The furniture industry, he said, is poised to increase its
contribution to the foreign exchange earnings of the country in
view of the growing demand for Malaysian-made furniture.
	   ``We are almost reaching our target of RM4 billion which we had
set for the furniture industry by the year 2000,'' he added.
	   Earlier, in his speech, he said Malaysian furniture
manufacturers are taking great strides in improving quality and
finishing with the utilitisation of new technology such as
ultra-violet and electron beam.
	   He noted that 10 Malaysian wood-based companies have introduced
the use of ultra violet and electron beam as radiation coating to
provide high quality surface finishings for wood based products,
including parquet flooring and panels.
	   Dr Lim said more manufacturers should invest in this technology
and expand its use to other wood-based products such as medium
density fibreboard, chipboard and wood-cement board.
	   ``We must ensure that most of the surface finishing required is
carried out in Malaysia itself and not in the importing
countries,'' he added.

	   THE Government is neutral when investigating disputes between
employers and employees on retrenchment issues.
	   Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek said the ministry
serves as a mediator.
	   ``All complaints received by the ministry or the Labour Office
are thoroughly investigated to ensure that any retrenchment is
carried out in accordance with the law,'' Lim told reporters in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   ``We will investigate if there is any injustice or
dissatisfaction among the retrenched employees, even if it involves
only one member,'' he said.
	   Lim told reporters his ministry has received several letters of
complaints but there were insufficient details which made it
difficult for investigations.
	   Earlier the minister met the Kuala Lumpur Golf  Country Club
Bhd (KLGCC) management and workers after complaints from 16 workers
that they had been retrenched on April 30 while the KLGCC still
retained the services of 40 Bangladeshi and Indonesian workers.
	   Following the meeting with the management and workers, Lim said
the KLGCC agreed to pay more than the statutory requirement.
	   ``The KLGCC management has agreed to increase the retrenchment
benefits by paying 25 days salary for each year of service for
those who had worked less than five years and 30 days salary for
each year of service for those with more than five years'
service,'' Lim said.
	   Under the Employment Act 1955, those working for less than five
years should be paid 15 days salary for each year of service while
those working more than five years must be paid 20 days salary for
each year of service.

	   CHINA has agreed to give 2 million tonnes of corn in exchange
for 300,000 tonnes of Malaysian palm oil in a barter trade
arrangement that is still being worked out.
	   Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said he
has directed his officials to contact the local feedstock industry
to establish the viability of this barter.
	   ``We will need to establish whether the industry could take the
2 million tonnes of corn,'' he told reporters after officiating at
a one-day seminar on ``Product Finishing Using Ultra
Violet/Electron Beam Technology'' in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   It was reported that Malaysia's imports of animal feed is
estimated to cost the country some RM4 billion this year. Last
year, Malaysia's imports of cereals and animal feed were mainly
from the US, amounting to RM953 million.
	   Dr Lim said the proposed arrangement with China is in line with
the country's initiative to move away from over-using hard
currencies in trade.
	   The minister has discussed the barter possibility during his
visit to China last week.
	   He said this type of arrangement need not be limited solely to
corn as there are other agriculture produce from the republic that
Malaysia could barter trade with China.
	   The minister said he foresees no complications on the proposed
barter trade because Malaysia has already established various
bilateral agreements with China.
	   China is the third largest consumer of Malaysian palm oil after
Pakistan and India. It purchased some 874,000 tonnes of palm oil in
1996 against 1.05 million tonnes in 1995.
	   Dr Lim said China is also keen on a tripartite arrangement with
local companies to establish oil palm plantations in a third
country that has abundence of labour and land.
	   The countries include Indonesia, Thailand, Latin American
nations, West African countries and South Pacific nations, he
added.

Study predicts outer space will become tourist destination 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ France may be the world's most popular
tourist destination now, but within 20 years it will be competing
with places like the polar ice caps and even outer space, tourism
experts said Wednesday.
	   A study by the Madrid-based World Tourism Organization, called
``Tourism 2020 Vision,'' forecast that in 20 years' time people
will be traveling to outer space after having exhausted the
possibilities of Earth.
	   The WTO opened a two-day international conference in Lisbon to
try and predict the way the tourism industry is headed.
	   Based on the study, tourism officials from 84 countries were to
look at ways of broadening vacations to new market niches.
	   The study predicted that by 2020, 1.6 billion people will be
taking annual vacations.
	   ``By then, tourists will have visited all possible destinations
around the globe and ... will have turned to space tourism,'' the
study said.
	   France was the most popular tourism destination last year with
66.8 million visitors, followed by the United States with 49
million, according to the WTO.
	   By 2010, the Eastern Asia and Pacific region will become the
second most popular destination, overtaking the U.S., the WTO said.

Journalists welcome advent of press freedom, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Senior journalists welcomed yesterday the recent
advent of greater press freedom and called on the government to
revoke all rulings which repressed the media and even threatened
their survival.
	   Susanto Pudjomartono, editor in chief of The Jakarta Post daily,
said the reform movement had given the press favorable momentum to
free itself from decades of oppression from former president
Soeharto's repressive government, thus allowing it to help revive
democratic principles in the country.
	   He then urged all government rulings which restrict either press
freedom, freedom of opinion or freedom to form unions to be lifted.
	   The day-long discussion was organized by the Association of
Independent Journalists (AJI), an underground union of journalists
banned by the Soeharto administration.
	   According to Susanto, among rulings which should immediately be
revoked is Ministerial Decree No. 1/1984 on publishing licenses and
the decree that recognizes the Indonesian Journalists Association
(PWI) as the only union for journalists and the Newspaper
Publishers Association (SPS) as the only union for newspaper
publishers.
	   Atmakusumah, a senior journalist and executive director of the
Dr. Soetomo Press Institute, said the government should also
substitute the restrictive law on publishing licenses with a more
positive one which supports and guarantees press freedom.
	   ``I agree with the idea that the government should not have the
authority to revoke publishing licenses. The Criminal Code can be
used to impose sanctions against violations by the mass media.
	   ``The government should be able to take a newspaper, or a TV
station, to court. But it's unfair to revoke publishing licenses,''
he said.
	   He further described the current press laws which were issued in
1966 and 1982 as unfavorable, illusive and impractical.
	   AJI chairman Lukas Luwarso expressed hope that in this era of
reform, the mass media could go back to its original function as an
independent presenter of public information.
	   ``Let the courts, as the legal mechanism in society, rule on
problems caused by mass media reports,'' he said, pointing to
charges of libel as a legal avenue which could be pursued.
	   Prison
	   Susanto said one of the most encumbering remnants of the old
regime on the press was the ``mental prison'' often faced by
journalists who had a self-censorship mechanism embedded within
their psyche after years of strong control.
	   ``The press should now be brave and replace the excessive use of
euphemism and slogans with direct, frank journalism,'' he said.
	   According to him, the government should play a limited role in
the media in order to prevent a new form of oppression in the
press.
	   ``Control of the press should be carried out by the press itself
... Violations committed by the press should be tried by a court
which is free of government interference,'' he remarked.
	   Susanto, former journalist of the banned Tempo weekly, suggested
an independent team of experts be established to regularly evaluate
the press' credibility so the press could continually improve
itself.
	   Atmakusumah concurred, adding that the public should be another
important element in controlling the press by ensuring it adheres
to a code of ethics.

Mixed reaction on AMC funding source, BUSINESS TIMES

<TEXT>
	   THERE were mixed reactions from financial market and analysts on
the funding source of the proposed Asset Management Company (AMC),
which was formed to take over troubled loans and assets in the
banking sector.
	   Some analyst said there must be foreign fund injection to help
the company to buy up loans off commercial banks, others seems to
think that the sources of the funding will not determine the
success of AMC.
	   Goldman Sachs Asia regional economist Donald Hanna said the
participation of the foreign funds and the private sector is to
demostrate that AMC is ``truly market oriented programme and not a
bailout''.
	   Yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad had
said that the Government may finance up to 60 per cent of the
capital needs of AMC while the private sector will fork out the
balance.
	   The funds, Dr Mahathir had added will be drawn from the
Government's consolidated accounts, and not through taxation or the
central bank.
	   Hong Kong-based Hana is quick to add that AMC is part of the
solutions to Malaysian economic problem as banks will be able to
concentrate on lending and injects much-needed liquidity into the
system to finance productive sector activities and not the
collection of loans.
	   The AMC will acquire non-performing loans and assets of local
financial institutions at market prices with a view to revive and
then sell them at a profit.
	   The objective is to free the banks to concentrate on financing
economic activities.
	   ``The idea of pulling problem loans off the books of the banks
is crucial in the solution for the credit movement in Malaysian
banking system.
	   ``AMC is part of the solution but problem will arise when loans
rises rapidly as the economy slows down, making it difficult to
sell problem loans at a market price,'' he said adding that the
slowdown is from the impression given by the negative 1.8 per cent
growth in the gross domestic product.
	   However, he said the Government has given an impressive
guarantee and question arise on the mechanism of the guarantee,
especially during a period when asset quality deteriorates making
it difficult for banks to book loans.
	   However question arise on the capitalistion of the banks and
mechanism of the guarantee.
	   When asked on the non-performing loan, Hanna said, that he
expects it to peak over 25 per cent in 1999.
	   ``There are other steps to be taken if our feel on the NPL ratio
is correct. These includes greater clarity on deposit guarantee in
order to ensure that people continue to hold deposits in banks,''
he said.
	   Analysts had expect the Government to provide the start-up funds
including a bond issue with a government guarantee.
	   However, there were no speculation on the amount to be raised as
it will only be determined only after AMC has assessed the
situation.
	   Mr Mohamed Azman Yahya, who has been appointed as chief
executive of AMC had said earlier that full disclosure and
transparency in the agency's operations.
	   The operational structure of the agency is currently being
worked out together with Bank Negara and other consultants.
	   The AMC has also been given a timetable by the Finance Ministry.

	   The trading in the local foreign exchange market Tuesday was
active. Demand for the US dollar was high due to import payments
and low inward remittances and in the interbank market and it was
reported to have traded between Taka 46.45 and 46.4650. Call money
rate remained steady and was reported to have ranged between 8.5
and 10 per cent. In the kerb market cash dollar traded between Taka
47.70/95.
	   In the international forex markets US dollar is still going
strong against the Japanese yen although it fell from its 7 year
high of 139.80. Optimism about Japanese economy expressed by the
Japanese vice finance minister, Eisuke Sakakibara, helped yen from
further depreciation. Yen was also supported by reports that G7
deputy finance ministers will hold a meeting in Paris in the first
week of June where Japan will discuss ways of curbing yen's
downfall but the trend is still bearish. On the other hand it is
though that the dollar may lose some grounds against the DEM if
something comes up in support of Russia. India's financial markets
fell on Tuesday as investors considered the latest budget as
conservative and not aimed at higher economic growth. The Indian
rupee fell further later in the day to 41.700 from the mornings
opening of 41.66.
	   In Pakistan, the government announced emergency three pronged
strategy to face the new challenges after sanctions imposed by the
US for conducting nuclear tests. Among the stringent plan is
temporary restriction of withdrawal of foreign currency deposits by
to be at 1:1.6 ratio.
	   At 1730 hours local time the US dollar traded at 1.7796/06 DEM,
139.05/10 yen and GBP at 1.6365/70 against US dollar 47.70/95.

	   WEAK market sentiments and a continued bullish US dollar
sentiment affected the regional currencies including the ringgit
yesterday.
	   The ringgit, which opened at an easier 3.9300/400 yesterday,
closed at 3.9450/550 from Monday's close of 3.9250/450. It was
traded at a high of 3.9250 and a low of 3.9800 yesterday.
	   ``It is the announcement of the GDP figure and interest rates
too. People were caught unaware about the GDP figures. Therefore,
they are making their move now,'' a dealer said.
	   Meanwhile, another dealer said market is long on dollars and
they are willing to take profits faster.
	   ``The market is buying and dumping currencies fast. The wider
spread of about 500 points is no big deal.
	   ``Meanwhile, market did not react positively to Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad's statement in Tokyo,'' he added.
	   Dr Mahathir in his speech at a Tokyo Symposium called for a
system to set currency rates based on countries economic, political
and social indicators, rather than letting them be decided freely
by the market.
	   The regional currencies were also affected by the worry on the
performance of the yen, another dealer said.
	   The baht was traded at 4250.00 against the greenback, the rupiah
at 11,800 and the Singapore dollar at almost 1.70 to the US dollar.
	   Meanwhile, the greenback was trading at 139.25 yen on the Tokyo
foreign exchange market yesterday, up 0.13 yen from late Monday.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An outlawed Iranian opposition group claimed
responsibility Wednesday for a bomb and two mortar attacks on
government buildings that killed at least three people.
	   In the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, a spokesman for the opposition
group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, warned of more attacks.
	   ``Our units inside Iran will escalate attacks against the
regime,'' Mohammad Mohaddessin told The Associated Press.
	   In the first high-level response to the attacks, Parliamentary
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said Wednesday that Iran's enemies
were seeking to exploit apparent differences among Iran's top
leadership.
	   ``Unity of expression is essential for revolutionary forces ...
(who) must stand against those who want to fish in muddy waters,''
said Nateq-Nouri, a leading hard-liner in the government who is
known to be opposed to the moderates led by President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   A bomb exploded Tuesday at the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office
in Tehran. Official sources, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said at least three people were killed and two injured.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency denied the bombing was
the work of the Mujahedeen, but Tehran's Governor General Mohammad
Reza Ayatollahi was reported by state-run television Wednesday as
saying the opposition group was behind the attack.
	   In a statement Wednesday, the Mujahedeen said it carried out the
bombing as well as two mortar attacks Tuesday on the Central
Command Headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and
the Defense Industries Organization in the capital.
	   The Mujahedeen statement said the three attacks were in
retaliation for the killing of its members by the Iranian
government in recent months.
	   ``In the surprise attack, several Revolutionary Guards were
killed or wounded and the headquarters' buildings were damaged,''
the group said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
	   It did not claim any casualties for the attack on the defense
industries building.
	   However, Iranian radio said security men foiled an attempted
attack by ``saboteurs'' at the Revolutionary Guards headquarters
Tuesday and the perpetrators fled.
	   Official media did not speak of an attack on a Defense
Industries building, but they did report a bomb explosion at an
unidentified government building in northern Tehran late Tuesday.
It was not known if this property belonged to Defense Industries.
	   There was no report of casualties in this bombing.
	   The Iranian newspaper Farda had reported Tuesday that 50
Mujahedeen fighters had sneaked into Iran across the largely
unguarded border with Afghanistan.
	   In Baghdad, Mohaddessin said the Mujahedeen military camps in
Iraq, close to the Iranian border, were on alert for expected
reprisals from the Tehran government.
	   Also Wednesday, police evacuated guests and staff at the
Ferdowsi Hotel in central Tehran following a bomb threat made by a
caller, sources said. No bomb was found at the hotel, which is
close to the Foreign Ministry and military offices.
	   A police officer at the prosecutor's office said a bomb in a
briefcase caused the explosion. However, the official news agency
said the explosion was caused by explosives which went off
accidentally as they were being brought into the building as
evidence for a case.
	   Newspapers published higher casualty tolls than given by
officials. Three government-controlled newspapers said five people
were killed, and one added that another nine people were injured.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government said Wednesday it is back on track
with a new deal to build a high-speed rail link between London and
the Channel Tunnel _ although the plans still will leave Britain
lagging years behind France and Belgium.
	   Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said he has signed a new
agreement with London and Continental Railways, the original
contractor whose plans came up short of cash last winter, and
Railtrack PLC, which operates Britain's railroad tracks and
signaling equipment and was brought into the high-speed link
project to save the deal.
	   The government's new arrangement will see a group including
British Airways taking over the operation of the Eurostar passenger
trains that take passengers under the sea on the London-Paris and
London-Brussels routes, beating out archrival Richard Branson's
Virgin companies.
	   Branson warned of ``astronomically high'' fares, saying that
British Airways was the dominant airline flying between London and
Paris. Branson noted that one of British Airways' partners in the
train venture, National Express, is the biggest bus company on the
London-Paris route, and charged they will have the ability to
control the market with a ``cartel approach.''
	   The slow train tracks in Britain have been an embarrassment ever
since the undersea ``Chunnel'' has been open.
	   France completed its high-speed train tracks between Paris and
the Channel Tunnel five years ago, and Belgium completed its
high-speed link to Brussels last year. The fast tracks allow
Eurostar trains to hit top speeds of 186 miles per hour (300 kph).

Parliament rejects motion to postpone START II hearings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers rejected a proposal by
ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky on Wednesday to
postpone hearings on the START II treaty, a news agency reported.
	   Zhirinovsky wanted the hearings held this fall, as originally
planned.
	   But parliament announced Tuesday that it had decided to hold
closed-door hearings on the treaty next week. The State Duma stuck
to that timetable Wednesday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   However, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov has warned that the hearings
set for June 9 would be shelved if President Clinton continues to
put pressure on Russia to pass the treaty.
	   Clinton has said he doesn't want to come to Moscow for a summit
with Yeltsin until after the treaty has been ratified.
	   START II was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin has been urging the Duma to take quick
action.
	   But the Communists and nationalists who dominate the Duma have
stalled, saying that reducing Russia's nuclear arsenal would
further weaken the country's security.
	   The treaty would cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals to
3,500 warheads each.

	   PETROLEUM contractors have completed drilling and testing to
appraise gas discovered at the Jengka West-1 well of Block B-17
which is located within the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development
Area (JDA).
	   According to a statement issued by the Malaysia-Thailand Joint
Authority (MTJA) in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, the contractors, who
began drilling at the Jengka West-1 well on April 20 this year, had
completed the task, with the final depth of 3,100 metres.
	   According to the statement, the objective of the well was to
firm up the gas reserves and to test the sand and hydrocarbon
distribution to the west of Jengka field. The well encountered
several gas-bearing sands, with a total net pay of 25.1 metres.
	   Two drill stem tests were conducted between 2,460 metres and
3,028.5 metres, with one test flowed at the rate of 7.42 million
standard cubic feet per day of gas and 59 barrels per day of
condensate measured through choke size of 56/64 inches.
	   The operator, Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Co Sdn Bhd, on behalf of
the contractors for Block B-17 and Block C-19 - Petronas Carigali
(JDA) Sdn Bhd and PTTEP International Ltd - has plugged and
abandoned the well and released the ``Marine 500'' rig yesterday.

Parliament debates screening of former communist collaborators 
</HEADLINE>

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Rightist and leftist deputies were divided
Wednesday over how to screen Poland's top officials to put an end
to unproven allegations of past collaboration with the communists.
	   In an effort to bring to life an April 1997 screening law that
remains largely on paper after judges refused to sit on a screening
panel, parliament discussed a proposal to assign another body the
task.
	   Most speakers stressed the need for a viable legislation that
would allow screening officials nine years after the communist
system collapsed.
	   ``Screening is not a solution to the communist past,'' said Jan
Litynski of the junior government partner, Freedom Union. He
stressed that recent allegations that the interior minister
collaborated with the communist secret service proved the procedure
was still badly needed.
	   Last month, minister Janusz Tomaszewski was accused in media
reports of failing to admit in a screening declaration that he was
an agent of the communist secret police.
	   The screening law requires all Cabinet members and top state
officials to make a written statement whether or not they
collaborated.
	   The rightist government coalition of Solidarity and Freedom
Union, along with the Polish Peasants' Party, supported the
Senate's proposal to appoint a public interest watchdog and assign
the Warsaw Appeals Court to review the declarations.
	   The former communists of the Democratic Left Alliance were
strongly critical, arguing that collaboration should be limited to
activities against human rights, the former democratic opposition
and the powerful Roman Catholic church, while intelligence and
counterintelligence agents should be excluded from the procedure.
	   This law could damage state security, if names of secret service
agents get revealed, said ex-communist deputy Janusz Zemke.
	   ``So far we have had a lame law. Today we are getting a draft
which is completely sick,'' he said.
	   During the current session ending Friday, parliament will decide
whether to accept the draft for fine tuning or take a final vote.
	   But the current proposal does not seem to revive the screening
procedure since President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former
communist, has indicated he would veto the Senate-proposed
amendments.
	   Most Poles would like to see the screening law implemented.
Three-quarters surveyed in a January government poll said they
supported the idea of screening. Just 12 percent were against it.
The margin of error was 3 percent.

	   RINGGIT closed lower against the US dollar yesterday at
3.9450/550 from 3.9250/350 on Monday following the relatively weak
economic outlook in the Asian region, a dealer said.
	   The continuous weakening of the yen against the greenback also
pulled down other currencies in the region, another dealer said.
	   The ringgit moved within 3.9250 and 3.9700 against the US dollar
yesterday.
	   The local unit was also lower against the Singapore dollar at
2.3372/452 from 2.3072/395, against the yen at 2.8332/414 from
2.8166/248, against the Deutschemark at 2.2162/224 from 2.2099/162
as well as against pound sterling at 6.4595/799 from 6.4048/394 on
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   Some facts about Germany's premier high-speed ICE train, which
derailed Wednesday.
	     ___
	   HISTORY: Developed in 1980s by German consortium including
electronics giant Siemens. Contracted by federal Deutsche
Bundesbahn. ICE prototype in 1985 was first rail vehicle in world
to exceed 400 kilometers (248 miles) per hour on test track.
Regular service started in 1991 with 23 trains. Cut travel time for
850 kilometer (475 mile) Munich-Hamburg trip by more than two
hours, to 5 hours 37 minutes.
	     ___
	   POWER: First-generation ICE models, such as train that crashed
Wednesday, have two electric-powered locomotives, front and rear.
Can carry 14 passenger cars, each 29 meters (95 foot) long. Maximum
total capacity: 759 people. Top speed: 280 kilometers (175 miles)
an hour. Takes 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to emergency
stop.
	     ___
	   SERVICE: ICE trains carry average 65,000 passengers per day,
mostly business people traveling between Germany's major cities.
Four routes connect 150 cities, covering 3,500 kilometers (2,175
miles) of railroad tracks. Trains run hourly from early morning to
late at night.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders pleaded with
Western officials Wednesday for military intervention to halt what
they said is a deliberate Serb strategy of forced expulsions from
Kosovo, as more refugees poured over the border to Albania.
	   The request came with no sign of a letup in the Serbs' offensive
aimed at smashing resistance to their authority in the secessionist
province of southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
10-to-1.
	   According to Albanian sources, Serb forces shelled at least five
villages Wednesday in an area of western Kosovo near the Albanian
border, sending more residents fleeing. Houses were set ablaze in
the attack by Serb police and paramilitary units, backed by
Yugoslav army tanks.
	   New casualty reports from the sealed-off area were not
available. Dozens are believed dead since the start of a stepped-up
campaign last week by the Serbs, who want to wipe out the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. At least 80 people were
killed in a similar crackdown in March, and well over 200 people
have died this year in clashes.
	   Top aides to Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Albanians'
self-described independent government, met with a European
delegation in Kosovo's capital Pristina on Wednesday. They told the
officials that ``ethnic cleansing and massacres carried out by Serb
forces in western Kosovo are a part of a planned-out scheme of
ethnic cleansing throughout the province.''
	   The situation is dramatic and NATO must intervene, they told the
delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, headed by Javier Ruperez. They said world powers also must
pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is determined
to keep Kosovo from breaking away from Serbia, one of two remaining
republics in Yugoslavia.
	   ``Unless there is significant international pressure on
Belgrade, chances for a peaceful solution to the crisis will be
lost forever,'' Alush Gashi said.
	   But NATO allies, with 34,000 troops already in neighboring
Bosnia, are reluctant to commit another big contingent to the
Balkans.
	   Meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, they agreed to consider again
whether to deploy combat troops to Albania and Macedonia on
Kosovo's borders, but indicated a decision is not imminent.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed until we have solid,
well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO official who asked
not to be named.
	   NATO Secretary-General Xavier said, however, ``We are keeping
all options open.''
	   Ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations did agree to accelerate other
measures, including technical and military assistance for Albania
and Macedonia.
	   Besides thousands of displaced Kosovo residents who have sought
shelter in border highlands, several thousand others have streamed
over the border into Albania.
	   OSCE spokesman Bill Foxton confirmed at the Albanian border that
at least two refugees had died as a result of the arduous trek over
the mountains _ a 60-year-old man of a heart attack and a
4-year-old girl who died when her mother, who was carrying her,
slipped and fell on a rocky path.
	   International monitors near the border said houses could be seen
in flames in the besieged village of Junik. The pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said the fighting was spreading east of
Djakovica, one of the hotpots for the last several days.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
2,000 refugees crossed overnight into Albania, bringing the total
to some 3,700 since the Serb assault was launched late last week.
	   Most are women, children and elderly who are ``exhausted
mentally and physically,'' spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   Albania's state-run ATA news agency said about 3,000 more
refugees were approaching the border.
	   Local authorities in northeastern Albania, site of most of the
crossings, said that with more refugees arriving by the hour, the
25 tons of aid sent Tuesday by the U.N. refugee agency was
inadequate.
	   In a report documenting growing reluctance to die for Kosovo,
the daily Telegraf, published in Belgrade, reported that about 100
policemen had been fired for refusing to go fight in the province.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 80 people and
seriously injuring 200 as car after car of the train crumpled into
the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear. Police spokesman
Joachim Lindenberg said it appeared that the impact of the train
collapsed the overpass, sending an auto parked on the structure
plunging to the tracks.
	   The auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the
tracks, Lindenberg told German television ARD. He said that anyone
that close to the accident could not have survived. Deutsche Bahn
did not immediately confirm that account.
	   Earlier reports, based on witness accounts to authorities,
suggested that the auto had plunged into the train causing it to
derail.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while
the cars derailed and jackknifed into each other.
	   At least 13 cars derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed the
cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. They said they expected the
death toll to rise as rescue workers pulled apart the wreckage.
	   Survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the region. The Red
Cross had chartered six buses to take most of the uninjured to
Hamburg, spokesman Harald Krueger said.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991.
	   A 1967 rail accident near Magdeburg in then-East Germany, killed
94 people in the deadliest rail accident since World War II. A
crossing barrier closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline,
causing it to explode and spreading fire into passenger cars.
	   The worst accident in western Germany was in 1971, when a train
carrying children on a field trip collided with a freight train,
killing 46 people.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 800 rescue workers were at the scene, including trauma
surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free passengers
trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Christian Krettek, of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN
that rescue workers expected the death toll to rise, and it was
still unclear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The train that crashed Wednesday was a first-generation ICE
model powered by two electric-powered locomotives pulling up to 14
passenger cars with a capacity of 759 passengers. At top speed the
train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to an emergency
stop.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

	   IT IS ``timely'' that the Commonwealth Press Union (CPU)
biennial conference should be held in Kuala Lumpur, according to
the union's Malaysian chapter chairman, Datuk A. Kadir Jasin, who

which is having an impact on the global scene,'' he told a press
conference on the CPU in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Themed the ``Eye of the Tiger'', the conference will be held
from October 26-29 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It was last held
in Cape Town two years ago.
	   It will be opened by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad while Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku
will give the opening addresss.
	   About 200 delegates and observers wil be attending the
conference which will be preceded by the CPU Editors' Forum in

	   CPU executive director Mr Mark Robinson said, ``The opening day
of the conference will focus on problems and achievements in the
region.
	   ``The second day is traditionally dedicated to key issues of
press freedom and human rights throughout the Commonwealth. Other
sessions will include the CPU's future role and the future of the
Commonwealth newspaper industry.''
	   The conference is sponsored by major companies including
Malaysia Airlines which is contributing air tickets worth RM71,000;
the Mandarin Oriental Hotel group and The New Straits Times group.
	   The CPU has 750 members who are media representatives in
Commonwealth countries. The union also organises training for its
members.
	   According to Kadir, newspaper companies in Malaysia that are
members of the CPU include the New Straits Times group, Utusan
Melayu group, The Star group, Sin Chew Jit Poh, and Nanyang Siang
Pau.

	   Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI) has extended its all out
support on the draft industrial policy taken by the government.
	   In a statement issued Tuesday, BCI President Sharif M Afzal
Hossain said if the draft industrial policy was accepted by the
government, it would bring a revolutionary change in the industrial
sector of the country.
	   The BCI president said, ``the draft policy is a liberal one and
will be treated as a milestone in the industrial development of
Bangladesh.''
	   The BCI president said that the proposed draft policy would play
a vital role in accelerating industrialisation in the country.
	   The draft policy, he hoped, would be discussed and passed in the
coming budget session of Parliament for the interest of the
country, says a press release.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The National Police could discharge its law
enforcement duties more effectively if it became an independent
entity separate from the Armed Forces (ABRI), the chairman of the
Association of Police Science said yesterday.
	   Maj. Gen. (ret) Wik Djatmika told Antara that as an element of
ABRI, the National Police currently had to abide by the military's
single chain of command, and this often was an obstacle to their
chief task of enforcing the law.
	   The National Police force is currently part of ABRI, along with
the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Under this structure, the
National Police chief reports to the ABRI commander.
	   Wik said some of the commands issued by ABRI had often clashed
with law enforcement matters. When this happens, law enforcement
interests are sacrificed, he said. He did not cite any examples.
	   He said many retired senior police officers felt that the police
could carry out their duties better if they were not part of ABRI's
chain of command.
	   Wik said the status of the National Police was currently defined
by the 1982 Law on National Defense and Security, the 1982 Law on
Soldiers and the 1997 Law on Police.
	   These laws should be reviewed before the National Police can be
separated from ABRI, he said.
	   He said if the laws were not reviewed, the National Police force
could be given greater autonomy, such as in carrying out criminal
investigations without outside interference.

European Union reaches out to its Mediterranean partners

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) - The European Union came together with its
Mediterranean partners Wednesday, trying to get the economic
cooperation process back on track after last year's derailment by
Mideast issues.
	   Despite the will to refocus on economic issues, however, the
increasing violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo and the
impasse in the Middle East peace talks threatened to push their way
on to the agenda of the 15 EU foreign ministers and their 12
Mediterranean colleagues Wednesday and Thursday.
	   A year ago in Malta, the Euro-Mediterranean ministers tried to
talk trade and investment, only to see their meeting blown away by
the turbulent winds of the Mideast peace process. Even at the
inaugural meeting of the Euro-Med conference in Barcelona in 1995,
heady ideas also fell victim to disputes, that time over human
rights.
	   The Palermo meeting is an informal session with no set agenda.
Organizers hoped it would bring the conference back to its original
idea of creating a European-Mediterranean free trade and security
zone by the year 2010.
	   Nonetheless, Farouk Kaddoumi, head of foreign affairs for the
Palestine Liberation Organization, wanted to keep the Middle East
peace process alive.
	   ``We want a clear statement which shows the Europeans stand in
support of the process of peace and expresses their willingness to
revive the process,'' he said. ``And they have to refer to those
who stand as a detriment to this process.''
	   Israel views the EU as pro-Arab and wants no significant role
for Europeans in the peace process beyond supplying funding.
	   ``France and Britain have supported Israel since its creation,''
Kaddoumi said. ``Now, they claim the Europeans are friends of the
Palestinians. I hope that is true ... and that they cut all
economic assistance to the Israelis.''
	   No direct Palestinian-Israeli contacts are expected here,
however.
	   With violence on the rise in Kosovo, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Europe ``has to reconsider the entire picture.''
	   ``We certainly deplore the fact that there should be these
attacks ... contrary to the spirit of conciliation,'' Dini said.
NATO, he said, is studying the possibility of throwing up a
``shield'' of troops between Kosovo and its neighbors.
	   ``It has to be recognized that it is from the southern countries
that there is a flow of weapons into the area,'' he said.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook repeated the EU's ``deep
concern'' for the situation and once again called on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosovic ``to halt the killing'' in Kosovo.
	   ``Dialogue cannot prosper unless there is an end to the
violence,'' he said.
	   Both issues will be discussed on the sidelines of the Euro-Med
meeting.
	   Joining ministers from the European Union are officials from
Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Vice Adm. Achmad Sutjipto was installed yesterday
as the new commandant general of the Armed Forces' academies,
replacing Lt. Gen. Tamlicha Ali.
	   Minister of Defense and Security/Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander
Gen. Wiranto led the transfer of duty ceremony held at ABRI
Headquarters in Cilangkap, East Jakarta.
	   Also present were Army Chief Gen. Subagyo HS, Chief of the Armed
Forces Staff and Command School Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto and
Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense and Security Lt. Gen.
Suyono.
	   Sutjipto was formerly commander of the Navy's Western Fleet.
	   Wiranto said during the ceremony that the regular change of
command over the academies was aimed at improving the military
educational system's effectiveness.
	   ``We realize that the transfer is held amid a crisis situation
and the spreading demand for total reform,'' he said, possibly
referring to the spate of transfers in the military's senior posts
over the last two weeks.
	   ``The Armed Forces' academies are expected to play a strategic
and vital role in producing professional and loyal cadets in
meeting all challenges faced by the nation as it enters the era of
globalization and reform,'' he said as quoted by Antara.
	   The military academies -- the Army Academy in Magelang, Central
Java; the Navy Academy in Surabaya, East Java; the Air Force
Academy in Yogyakarta and the National Police Academy in Semarang,
Central Java --have contributed greatly to the nation's
development, he said.
	   He thanked Tamlicha for his service in developing the academies
and wished him success in his next assignment.
	   Tamlicha will be appointed secretary-general of the Ministry of
Transmigration and Resettlement of Forest Squatters.

	   CHITTAGONG, June 2: Post and Telecommunications Minister
Mohammad Nasim today said the forthcoming budget will be framed
with the basic objective of achieving self-reliance in all spheres
of national life by reducing dependence on foreign.
	   Addressing a freshers' day function at the University of Science
and Technology Chittagong (USTC) as the chief guest the minister
said the highest allocation in the coming budget will be earmarked
in the education sector.
	   The ministers touching various aims and objectives of the
present government said Bangladesh is blessed with vast prospective
natural and mineral resources like gas, oil, limestone, tourism and
manpower and it can emerge as a developed country of this region
like Singapore and Sri Lanka.
	   But due to lack of proper and effective planning we could not
make any remarkable progress by exploitation and utilisation these
natural resources even after 25th year of independence, Nasim said.
	   Chaired by National Prof and Founder President of USTC Prof
Nurul Islam the function was addressed, among others, by Chittagong
City Mayor Alhaj ABM Mahiuddin Chowdhury, Rector of the University
Prof Shamim Jahangir and Project Director of the BBA programmes
Prof Anwarul Azim Arif while Syndicate member and renowned freedom
fighter Nur-e-Alam Siddiqui was present.
	   The minister said when present government came to power it has
identified four issues on priority basis for expediting the
development.
	   Referring to the power crisis in the country, the T and T
Minister said, ''as a minister of the responsible and accountable
government we did not try to conceal the power problem in the
country,'' but he said the present government has relentlessly
striving to overcome this problem inherited and accumulated by the
past government.
	   In this context Nasim emphatically said that international
tenders have already been invited for setting up of barge-mounted
plants and the country will be able to meet the demand of power by
next one and a half years.
	   Referring to the revolutionary change in free flow of
information throughout the world the minister said Bangladesh has
also entered into that information technology through massive
development of telecommunications system and Bangladesh was
connected with the world through Internet and E-mail.
	   Present government during its two years time connected some one
lakh forty thousand telephones throughout the country of which more
than half are digital, the minister said adding that whereas only
3.50 lakh telephones were connected since independence.

	   The president of the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (FICCI), AKM Shamsuddin, has called upon the government to
take steps to improve infrastructure facilities and eliminate
corruption for attracting foreign investments.
	   ``We have a good and liberal policy to attract foreign
investment compared to that of India and other countries in the
region, but there should be initiatives in making the
administration free of corruption,'' the FICCI President said in a
pre-budget interview with The Independent.
	   ``Besides, we also have our goodwill for the foreign investors.
Politically or religiously we are also not extremists,'' he said.
	   Urging the government to expedite the privatisation process, AKM
Shamsuddin said it was not the government's duty to do business.
	   ``All State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) should be sold to the
private sector and the government should not waste the money that
will come from the sale of the SOEs, by paying the salaries of the
oversized bureaucracy,'' he said with a suggestion to create a
special fund to help the private sector to make fresh investments
and take up different programmes including development of human
resources.
	   ``Small-scale engineering industries can also be supported with
the funds in which India is doing very well,'' he said.
	   The FICCI President said, there should be thorough and in-depth
feasibility studies of different types of industries. ``In this age
of globalisation, the industry that is feasible today will not be
viable tomorrow,'' he said.
	   According to him, the private sector would take the lead in
achieving growth in the national economy if there was proper
support from the government. ``There is a mistrust between the
government and the private sector and it must go... the government
will have to trust the private sector,'' he said.
	   Referring to the existing problems with the companies providing
mobile telephone lines, he said that some companies had been blamed
for failure to provide better service to clients, but it happened
due to the non-cooperation of the TT.
	   AKM Shamsuddin said that growth in many industries had declined.
``Since I run pharmaceutical industries I can tell you that the
growth of the pharmaceutical industries has gone down''.
	   The FICCI President suggested reducing the size of the
bureaucracy to curtail revenue expenditure.
	   He urged the government not to impose any new taxes in the new
budget. ``The discretionary powers of the government officials who
collect revenue should be curtailed to curb corruption,'' he said.
	   He suggested rationalising the tariff on the raw materials
imported for manufacturing products meant for domestic consumption
and on the imported finished goods.
	   ``The planners should keep it in mind that some taxes encourage
smuggling and there is a huge open border between Bangladesh and
India,'' he said.
	   Referring to Pakistan, he said that when this government raised
tariff on raw materials, Indian sarees flooded its markets and the
(Pakistan) government immediately reduced the tariff for the
protection of the local products. ``There in Bangladesh we hardly
see such an initiative,'' he said.
	   The FICCI President called upon the government to increase
savings and mobilise resources. ``To expedite the development, we
must achieve a double-digit growth rate.''
	   He said the tax-GDP ratio was almost flat in the past years and
in the last year it was close to 12 while it might come down this
year.
	   The FICCI President said the pre-shipment Inspection (PSI)
should be reintroduced to reduce corruption. ``The corruption under
the PSI system earlier was because of some dishonest people... the
government should allow the companies that have credibility
world-wide for the PSI,'' he said.
	   He called upon the government to work for the development of
software industries and upgrade the laws of the intellectual
property rights.

NATO accelerates plans to boost Albanian, Macedonia borders EDITS to conform. No pickup With Yugoslavia-Kosovo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with NATO chief insisting it keeps ``all options open''
By ROBERT WIELAARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Xavier Solana
reiterated Wednesday that the 16-member alliance was keeping ``all
options open,'' including a military reply to Serbia's violent
crackdown on a separatist movement in southern Kosovo province.
	   ``The news from Kosovo is not good. The situation is
deteriorating,'' Solana told reporters.
	   The NATO ambassadors reiterated they will consider sending
combat troops to those nations. They also agreed to accelerate
plans to help Albania and Macedonia seal their borders with Kosovo.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled the violence in Kosovo, where
Serb police and army forces have stepped-up their campaign since
late May to crush the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation
Army.Kosovo.
	   More than 200 people have been killed in the southern Serb
province where 90 percent of the population are ethnic Albanians.
	   Attacks on villages, the exodus of civilians and the deaths of
women and children have prompted comparisons to the ethnic war in
Bosnia, where conflict spiraled into civil war in the early 1990s
as NATO allies bickered over how to contain the Balkan crisis.
	   Solana rejected the comparison. In Kosovo, ``we are trying not
only to respond to events, but we are trying to prevent events,''
he said.
	   The allies have asked military planners to study the possibility
of military intervention.
	   ``We all agreed we cannot proceed (with an allied force) until
we have solid, well-thought out military advice,'' said a NATO
official, who asked not to be named. ``We first of all want to have
good, detailed military advice.''
	   The NATO official said getting the necessary military advice
``would take several days'' and then would have to be reviewed by
the NATO defense ministers who meet in Brussels on June 11-12.
	   Meantime, NATO agreed to accelerate other measures that included
technical and military assistance for Albania and Macedonia. The
first miliary advisors are to leave in a matter of days.
	   Also, NATO gave more priority to previously scheduled
small-scale joint military maneuvers in Albania and Macedonia, and
NATO's civil emergency and planning section was told to extend
immediate cooperation with U.N. officials dealing with the exodus
of Kosovo refugees.
	   Officials, however, rejected suggestions that NATO was again
slow off the mark by taking a cautious stance on deploying a large
alliance force in Albania and Macedonia.
	   ``NATO ... cannot do things which are not guaranteed to be
successful. We are going quickly, but we recognize there is a need
for substantive military work,'' the NATO official said.
	   NATO's Kosovo policy is guided by the belief the province should
not become independent but be given back the autonomy it once had
within the Yugoslav Republic.

Yeltsin seeks postponement of meeting with Ukrainian leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin asked Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma to postpone their scheduled June meeting
until July, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin needs to devote time to Russia's current financial
problems and has received urgent requests from governors to visit
some of the country's far-flung regions, presidential spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Interfax.
	   The two leaders were to have held informal talks in the Crimea
on June 20.
	   Outstanding issues between the two neighbors include the
division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet and the status of the
Crimean Peninsula, populated mostly by ethnic Russians.
	   Kuchma left Wednesday for the Crimean resort of Yalta where
leaders of 11 countries are to hold talks on transportation and
environmental issues related to the Black Sea.
	   The Black Sea Economic Cooperation forum includes the six
countries that border the sea, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Moldova,
Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Greece.
	   Participants are also expected to discuss transportation of
Caspian Sea oil from the huge deposits in Azerbaijan. Ukraine is
pushing for some of the oil to be carried by tankers to a terminal
at the Black Sea port of Odessa and then on to Europe.
	   Kuchma is due to hold a series of bilateral meetings, said his
spokesman Olexander Maidannik, and a tripartite meeting with
Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi and Romanian President Emil
Constaninescu.
	   They will discuss last year's agreement on a free economic zone
around the junction of the three countries' borders at the mouth of
the Danube River, a spokesman for Lucinschi told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.

	   The allegation made by Awami League leader Col (retd) Shawkat
Ali, MP, about Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad's involvement in the
killings of the late President Ziaur Rahman and Major General
Manzur were false, baseless and motivated, a close aide of Ershad
said on Tuesday.
	   Press Advisor to former President HM Ershad and Vice-Chairman of
Jatiya Party (JP), Fakir Ashraf in a statement last night condemned
the comments passed by Col (Retd) Shawkat Ali, MP and urged all
quarters to refrain from making such statements.
	   Addressing the launching of ``Zia Manzur Hatya Kando Ebong
Tarpor'' ( The killings of Zia and Manzur and the aftermath), a
book by ASM Shamsul Arefin at the National Museum on Monday, Col
Shawkat who is also the Chairman of the Bangladesh Muktijuddha
Sanghati Parishad (BMSP) blamed Ershad for the killings as part of
a well designed conspiracy to eliminate freedom fighters from army
and clear his way to power.
	   He said that former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow
of Ziaur Rahman had instituted over a dozen of cases against HM
Ershad, when she was in power. ``Begum Zia would not miss the
opportunity to file a case against him for killing her husband if
the statement of Shawkat was true,'' he said.
	   The JP leader said the comment on the killing of Manzur would be
subjudice and therefore he would not comment.
	   Meanwhile, Advocate Fazle Rabbi MP, Whip of JP Parliamentary
Party, in separate statement strongly protested the comments of Col
Shawkat urging him to refrain from giving such false and imaginary
statements.

	   While Angel ``El Divino'' Rodriguez rested comfortably in his
Mexico City mansion, federal deputies and senators agreed Tuesday
that Mexico needs stronger measures against white-collar crime,
Notimex reported.
	   National Action Party (PAN) Deputy Jorge Lopez Vergara said the
Federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) should train personnel
especially to fight the crimes committed by upper class
entrepreneurs.
	   Lopez Vergara also criticized the National Banking and
Securities Commission (CNBV) for failing to wield adequate control
over banking activities in Mexico.
	   The anger of Lopez Vergara and the other legislators was
prompted by the situation of ``El Divino.''Accused of several
counts of bank fraud, ``El Divino'' arrived in Mexico from Spain on
Monday after a 22-month extradition process.
	   Although there are four warrants for his arrest, the banker
remained free due to various legal injunctions preventing his
arrest or imprisonment.
	   If ``El Divino'' evades justice, Lopez Vergara said, ``it will
be because of the poor work'' of PGR officials.
	   ``We have to clean up the laws so that banking authorities can
detect whether or not a banking official is committing
multi-million dollar frauds,'' said the panista.
	   Lopez Vergara also called on the PGR to conduct a detailed
review of how ex-bankers Rodriguez, Carlos Cabal Peniche and Jorge
Lankeau -- all of whom are accused of fraud -- ran their
businesses.
	   In addition to reforming the powers of banking authorities, PAN
Deputies Fauzi Hamdan and Felipe de Jesus Cantu Rodriguez and
Marcelo Ebrard, an independent, added that white collar crimes need
to be considered serious crimes.
	   Ebrard stressed that legal reforms ``urgently'' needed to be
made so that white-collar crimes could be considered ``serious,'' a
move which would make the provisional liberty that ``El Divino''
enjoys harder to win.
	   In the Senate, Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Senator
Dionisio Perez Jacome said the Senate will examine modifications to
several laws in order to increase the sentences for white-collar
crimes.
	   Perez Jacome said that changes to the financial package sent to
Congress by President Ernesto Zedillo could be made in order to
avoid situations like that of ``El Divino.''Although current
legislation sanctions white-collar crimes with severe penalties,
the priista said, criminals like Rodriguez had succeeded in making
a mockery of Mexico's justice system.
	   The most important matter regarding the legal reforms is that
the changes ensure crimes similar to Rodriguez's do not happen
again, the senator said.
	   However, the ``Ley de Amparo,'' or Injunction Law, -- which
Rodriguez and other high-profile criminals have used to avoid
imprisonment -- should not be reformed, Perez Jacome insisted.
	   He called the Injunction Law an ``admirable institution'' of
Mexican Law.

	   At least 20 lakh people live in slums in the capital city with
55 per cent of them staying in bustees and 45 per cent in shanties
on government lands, a report of the Habitat Council of Bangladesh
said on Tuesday.
	   It said the total population of Dhaka City is 90 lakh and it is
feared to shoot up to nearly two crore by the year 2020 due to the
present trend of urban population increase by 10 per cent.
	   Secretary of the Council a KM Khorshed Alam, in the report, also
said that the problems in the slums were already acute due to lack
of minimum facilities needed for livelihood but it would increase
10 folds by the year 2020. ''These problems will go far beyond
control by the year 2020,'' he said.
	   Giving some visible reasons for increase in the number of slum
dwellers, he said unbridled growth in garment factories and
tanneries since the 1980s were largely responsible for the growth
of shanties in the capital city.
	   According to the report, the present rate of urban population
increase globally is 2.6 per cent while it is 3.8 per cent in the
developing countries and 5 per cent in Bangladesh. Dhaka's
population in 1951 was 3.36 lakh, in 1991 it was 70 lakh and in
1998 it became 90 lakh.
	   The report said the number of slum dwellers by the year 2020
would be around 1 crore in Dhaka city alone. ''We have evolved five
basic issues and put forward them to the government so that a way
of solution can be found out to resolve all these existing problems
faced by the slum dwellers in Dhaka city'', the report said.
	   The UN conference on human settlement held in Istanbul in 1996
identified 'migration from rural areas' and natural increase of
urban population' as challenges in Bangladesh.
	   The conference, however, advised Bangladesh government to engage
the poor in urban economy-construction of housing and
infrastructure, promotion of microcredit among them and facilitate
their skill development.
	   Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is implementing a
Taka 40 crore project of poor rehabilitation through improving the
livelihood of slum dwellers and their employment. It is also
implementing another long term project named urban basic service
delivery project of Taka 34 crore with the assistance of UNICEF for
slum dwellers in 21 pourashavas in the country, LGED sources said.
	   Besides, the Local Government Ministry with the assistance of
the UNDP has undertaken a Taka 60 crore project in four city
corporation areas for slum development. The government has also
undertaken an epoch-making scheme of Taka 30 crore for distribution
as micro-credit among the slum women for their self-employment, the
ministry sources said.
	   Yet another project of Taka 330 crore with the assistance of the
Asian Development Bank is being implemented in 22 cities and towns
of the country for spread of education among the slum children as
well as skill development and employment of slum people, the
sources said.
	   ''After implementation of all these programmes, the livelihood
of slum people will improve'' the sources said adding that the Taka
908 crore rural infrastructure development project, now being
implemented throughout the country, would help stop migration of
rural people to the cities in future.

	   A Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) deputy told
political, union, and humanitarian organizations in Europe Tuesday
that violence is even more prevalent in Guerrero than in
strife-ridden Chiapas, Agence France-Presse reported.
	   Martin Mora Aguirre, the secretary of the Chamber of Deputies'
Human Rights Committee, is in Paris along with two campesino
activists from Guerrero, including a woman who had two children
killed in 1995's bloody Aguas Blancas massacre.
	   ``Without downplaying what has occurred in Chiapas, there is
violence in other places and there are more human rights violations
in Guerrero than Chiapas,'' said the PRD deputy, citing a human
rights report from the center-left opposition party.
	   The PRD report cited 63 human rights violations in Guerrero in
1997, compared with 26 in Chiapas, 15 in Mexico City, and 15 in
Oaxaca.

	   LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Zillur Rahman on Tuesday warned
that the government cannot accept the unwillingness of pourashavas
to realise the designated amount of taxes fearing the loss of
popularity, a press release of the ministry said.
	   He said the local government activities are being disrupted the
pourashavas have been made dependent on government fund. He
stressed the importance of increasing revenue income, extending the
local tax net, renewal of it and proper assessment process.
	   Addressing a workshop on development of city infrastructures
organised by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGRD), in
the city as the chief guest, Zillur Rahman said an extensive
programme to develop the organisational and infrastructural
facilities of 22 pourashavas at a cost of Taka 330 crore has been
taken up under the Third City Development Project.
	   He said the project will be implemented with the assistance of
Asian Development Bank (ADB) to create employment opportunities and
increasing the quality of life, which will discourage the migration
of people from villages to the cities.
	   Presided over by Local Government Secretary AHM Abdul Hye, it
was addressed, among others, by urban development specialist of the
ADB headquarters Gulfer Cezayirli, LGED Chief Engineer Quamrul
Islam Siddiqui and Director of Third City Development Project
Mohammed Abdul Gaffar, C Lambrechtsen presented the keynote paper.
	   The workshop also stressed the need for leaving the cleanliness
programmes of the four city corporations and some services of the
pourashavas to the private sector.

	   The reign of Mexico's ``Amphetamine Kings'' is over, authorities
announced, heralding the demise of one of the country's largest
drug rings and this year's biggest blow against narcotics gangs.
	   Brothers Jesus Amezcua Contreras and Luis Amezcua Contreras,
known to police by their royal nickname, were arrested in
Guadalajara on Monday, officials from the Federal Attorney
General's Office (PGR) announced at a news conference. Officials
say the brothers headed the country's fourth-largest drug gang and
their arrest marks law enforcement's biggest feat against Mexico's
deadly cartels so far this year.
	   ``With the detention of Luis and Jesus Amezcua ... the Federal
Attorney General's Office considers that the largest trafficking
cartel of amphetamines and metamphetamines in Mexico has been
dismembered, which constitutes the most important action against
organized crime by the PGR so far this year,'' said special
prosecutor Mariano Herran Salvatti.
	   The Amezcuas are accused of smuggling chemicals from Europe and
Asia to Mexican ports, then converting the material into drugs and
smuggling them north to the United States. U.S. authorities want
the gang to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges and provided
Mexican officials with information to nab the brothers in the
16-month investigation, Herran Salvatti said.
	   The Amezcua Contreras band was behind other top drug rings: the
Tijuana, Gulf and Juarez Cartels.

AP Photo Planned
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw's Marriott hotel proved to be an
easy target for stunt climber Alain Robert, who avoided security
agents Wednesday and scaled the 41-story glass tower using only his
bare hands.
	   Robert, dubbed the Spiderman for his worldwide exploits, climbed
up to the roof of the 146-meter hotel in about 20 minutes. Upon
reaching the top, he was detained for two hours by police, then
released.
	   After his first attempt on Tuesday was foiled, Robert kept his
plan secret and did not inform the media of the attempt.
	   On Tuesday, police and security agents prevented Robert from
making the stunt and stopped him when he appeared on the roof of a
shopping center surrounding the hotel.
	   Robert, 35, of Valance, France, makes his living scaling tall
buildings as publicity stunts. He uses only his bare hands and no
cords or rigging.
	   He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the world's
fifth-tallest _ the Empire State Building in New York City.
	   Robert, making his first appearance in eastern Europe, was
invited by a Polish company that makes climbing gear.

	   The government has for the first time sanctioned funds in its
revenue budget to set up primary schools through non-governmental
organisations (NGO).
	   A total of 18 NGOs have been selected to set up 270 primary
schools in remote areas of the country at a cost of Taka 13.50
crore, an Education Ministry source told UNB.
	   The government will provide Tk five lakh for setting up each
school to be run by the concerned NGO. The scheme is aimed to
achieve the target of eradicating illiteracy by the year 2005.
	   The schools are expected to function from next January.
	   There are at present 78,000 primary schools in the country and
according to government statistics, about 6,000 villages have no
school.
	   Each of the NGO-run school will have a minimum number of 500
students in five classes from Class I-V with the provision to
extend up to class VIII.
	   The NGOs will have to run the schools without any government
donation in future and submit to the government a statement
mentioning its source of income to run the school.
	   The government has also set a condition of recruiting at least
four teachers, including two females. Recruitment of English and
Mathematics teachers is a must.
	   The headmaster and assistant teachers will have the
qualification as required in government primary schools. Every
school will have a managing committee with the distinguished people
of the locality.

	   Lawyers for Mexico City Police Chief Rodolfo Debernardi
Debernardi would like to see their client get another reprieve and
this week filed for an injunction to prevent his arrest on contempt
of court charges.
	   Debernardi, who heads the city's preventative police agency, the
Secretariat of Public Safety (SSP), is wanted on contempt of court
charges because he failed to order two police officers to testify
at a trial.
	   Debernardi had received an earlier and temporary injunction,
known in Mexican law as an amparo, or ``shelter,'' but that
injunction has run out.
	   Debernardi's lawyers, Maria Esther Fuentes and Victor
Santoprieto, are trying to get Federal District Judge Arturo Garcia
Torres to recognize another amparo that would prevent Debernardi
from being placed under ``administrative arrest.''
	   Another Federal District judge, Lilia Monica Lopez Benitez,
earlier had ordered that Debernardi be placed under
``administrative arrest'' for 36 hours for not ordering the
officers to act as witnesses in a case involving illegal traffic of
firearms.
	   Fuentes and Santoprieto filed their appeal on Monday but judge
Garcia Torres, who is headquartered in the Northern Penitentiary,
is not expected to make his final decision to grant the amparo
until about two weeks from now.

Corretja, Pioline advance to men's semifinals 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes, details
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Frenchman Cedric Pioline became the only
non-Spaniard in the men's semifinals of the French Open, battling
through five exhausting sets Wednesday to defeat Hicham Arazi.
	   As French flags waved in the stands, Pioline broke the
Moroccan's serve for a 4-2 lead in the final set and then held on _
fighting off a break point in the last game _ for the victory.
	   Pioline's 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win put him in the
semifinals with Spaniards Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya and Felix
Mantilla.
	   Pioline, who has played three five-set matches so far in the
tournament, will have a day to rest before facing Corretja in
Friday's semifinals.
	   ``I've got to be in shape for that, because Corretja is a good
baseline player who makes his opponent run a lot,'' said Pioline, a
former finalist at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open who made the French
Open semifinals for the first time.
	   Pioline became the first Frenchman to reach the semifinals at
Roland Garros since Henri Leconte in 1992. Just two French men have
won the French Open title since World War II, with Yannick Noah the
most recent in 1983.
	   The Pioline-Arazi match was 3 hours, 42 minutes of error-filled,
often tedious tennis _ the two players combined for 149 unforced
errors. But French fans hardly seemed to notice, yelling ``Oui'' on
his points and booing loudly when Arazi questioned line calls.
	   Arazi, who played most of the match with a blister on his left
foot, converted only five of his 21 break points in the match.
	   ``I'm going to jump into the Seine,'' he joked. ``The thing that
really did me in is that I stayed too much on the baseline. I
should have gone to the net. I should have volleyed more.''
	   Corretja reached his first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating
Filip Dewulf of Belgium 7-5, 6-4, 6-3, joining close friends Moya
and Mantilla in the final four.
	   ``This is history,'' Corretja said. ``I think it's really good
because normally it's not easy to have a country put three guys in
the semis of a Grand Slam. We used to see the American guys in
other tournaments, but not the Spanish guys.''
	   Deuwlf hadn't lost a set until his straight-set loss to
Corretja. The 39th-ranked Belgian was a semifinalist at Roland
Garros last year.
	   On Tuesday, No. 3 seed Marcelo Rios went the way of the other
top seeds in Paris. He was upset in four sets by Moya, losing his
chance to regain the No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   The Chilean held that spot for a month earlier this year, and
could have reclaimed it with a quarterfinal victory.
	   But at least one player remains on course _ Martina Hingis. The
undisputed best woman player defeated Venus Williams on Tuesday
with such ease that it put to rest any talk of a great rivalry _ at
least for now.
	   Hingis next faces a newly inspired Monica Seles, a three-time
champion in Paris, in one of Thursday's semifinals. No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport plays two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the
other.
	   With Davenport and Seles advancing, there are two American women
in the French Open semifinals for the first time since Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert in 1987.
	   But there were no echoes of Evert and Navratilova when Hingis
and Williams took the court. In a swirling wind that hampered both
players, Hingis used her deft touch and uncanny court sense to
dictate play.
	   Never in the 6-3, 6-4 victory did the Swiss star appear out of
control, off-balance or rushed. Williams hurt her cause with 38
unforced errors.
	   ``I don't think I was as patient as I should have been. I guess
everyone knows I like to hit,'' Williams said. ``I suppose I got a
little too excited, really wanted to hit a winner.''
	   Hingis came into the match with a 5-2 career record against the
eighth-seeded Williams, but the two 17-year-olds were 2-2 this
year.
	   The match promised to be an intriguing battle between power and
smarts. But, just as in their only previous Grand Slam tournament
encounter _ a 6-0, 6-4 win by Hingis in the U.S. Open final last
summer _ the match turned into a one-sided affair.
	   ``It's probably good for me to lose so I can really see what I'm
doing wrong and really look at myself and say, `Venus, you're not
there,''' she said.
	   Moya, the No. 12 seed who has been ranked as as high as fifth,
is hoping to crack back into the top 10 this week.
	   He became the talk of tennis at last year's Australian Open _
for his dashing looks and talent. He upset defending champion Boris
Becker in the first round, then went to the final, losing to
Sampras.
	   But except for that tournament, the 21-year-old had never gone
past the second round of any Grand Slam event. And at Roland
Garros, he hadn't gotten past the second round in two previous
visits.
	   Now Moya is the highest seed left. On Friday he faces Mantilla.
	   ``We're going to be friends until Friday,'' he said. ``When we
get to the court, I will try to kill him.''
	   Tuesday's play ended with Gustavo Kuerten, the defending
champion who lost in the second round, disqualified from doubles.
He threw his racket at the chair umpire, hitting a fan in the
stands, but apparently not causing injury.
	   ``I'm so sorry for what happened and I regret what I did,'' the
Brazilian said today. ``I know that this will make me a more mature
guy and will make me grow. I want to make it clear that I never had
the intention of hurting anyone on or off the court.''

Russia doubts North Korea has nuclear weapons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia does not believe that North Korea has
nuclear weapons, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   ``If North Korea has a nuclear bomb, it would have to test it,''
but no tests have been conducted, spokesman Georgy Kaurov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   A senior North Korean diplomat recently accused the United
States of delaying a deal that froze his country's suspected
nuclear program, hinting that communist state could restart the
program.
	   North Korea's ambassador to China, Chu Changjun, said a U.S.-led
group was lagging behind in building two nuclear reactors. North
Korea has also said promised U.S. deliveries of fuel oil are behind
schedule.
	   Under a 1994 pact between the longtime foes, Washington pledged
to help build the reactors and provide the oil in exchange for
North Korea dismantling a reactor believed to have produced
plutonium that could be used for bombs.
	   Kaurov said Russian specialists ``are closely watching'' the
situation in North Korea.
	   Countries thought to harbor nuclear aspirations have come under
closer scrutiny since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests
last month.

told the news agency prior to his departure for Europe last night.
	   During his eight-day European visit, Rahman, besides holding
talks with German officials, will have meetings with the Belgian
officials and officials of European Union at Brussels. His
three-day official visit to Germany begins on Wednesday.
	   Rahman said the issue of thousands of Bangladesh nationals
living in Germany illegally will be the main focus of his talks
with officials there. Germany has long been pressing to resolve
this issue, he added.
	   Describing his visit to Europe as ''routine'', Rahman said the
entire gamut of bilateral relations will be covered during talks
with the officials of the countries he would visit.
	   The foreign secretary said that besides asking Germany to raise
the level of its trade and economic relations with Bangladesh,
Dhaka will also seek Bonn's support to its candidature for the UN
Security Council non-permanent seat in the year 2000 and 2001.
Bangladesh was earlier elected to the seat for the 1977 and 1978
period.
	   Germany is a major trading partner of Bangladesh in Europe and
``we want to raise the trade volume further,'' Rahman added.
	   While in Belgium particularly at Brussels at the EU
headquarters, Bangladesh will request for total withdrawal of ban
on its fish and shrimp export to Europe. The European Union has
already partially withdrawn the ban following negotiations.
	   Rahman said that in his meetings with the Belgian officials,
besides asking them to boost trade and economic relations, he will
also request them to reconsider their decision regarding closure of
their diplomatic mission in Dhaka. Belgium has recently decided to
wind up its mission in Bangladesh. ''We will request them to
reconsider,'' he added.
	   The foreign secretary is scheduled to return home on June 9.

	   Mexico began the process which may lead up to an official
extradition request for U.S. agents who allegedly broke national
laws during the controversial Operation Casablanca sting which
netted Mexican bankers involved with money laundering, Foreign
Relations Secretary Rosario Green said Tuesday from Caracas.
	   Green is currently participating in the Organization of American
States general assembly in Venezuela. In a telephone interview with
the Mexican radio news program ``Para Empezar,'' which was reported
by Notimex, Green said she met with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Monday night and gave her a document listing
alleged crimes committed by U.S. authorities. Sting operations are
considered in Mexico to be a form of entrapment and are illegal.
	   The three violations listed in the document are: initiating a
commission of a crime (entrapment); money laundering (U.S.
authorities admitted that illegal transactions were allowed in
order to capture the suspects); and supplanting Mexican authority
(an alleged violation of treaty agreements).
	   Green said Albright appeared surprised when she was informed of
what laws were violated by U.S.
	   agents.
	   Citing a recent extradition agreement with the United States,
Green implored the northern neighbor to attend to these charges.
	   ``In the same way that we have extradited agents that have
committed crimes -- when it has been proven, when the judge has
given us the arrest order and when we have made all legal recourse
-- the return is also expected. (The treaty) works both ways.''''I
know it is causing stress ... but this will not be the first time
Mexico defends its rights in front of the United States,'' she
added.
	   Mexico's foreign relations chief said all necessary protocol
will be carried out before her country submits the extradition
request. ``I don't know how much time it will take, but I know I
have precise instructions from the president that we not restrain
ourselves; we are not going to give up, we are going to insist on
an investigation.''Albright disagreed with how the operation was
carried out without notifying the Mexican government and that ``a
notification should have gone out from the State Department,''
according to Green.
	   She added that U.S. citizens need to learn that legal boundaries
exist in other countries which are as solid as there own and they
should be respected.
	   ``In this respect, in the maintenance of the accords that we
have signed, we have to educate (the United States); probably it
will take a lot of time, but I believe that we have to keep
trying.''

	   Capital flowed back into emerging markets Tuesday spurring a
moderate 1.51-percent recovery in the stock market (Bolsa) and a
release of some of the downward pressure that has recently plagued
the peso.
	   The Bolsa's main IPC index closed at 4,480, up 66.49 points
after its biggest rally since April 28.
	   The peso strengthened 1.4 percent on the day, closing at 8.82.
	   ``The main issue now is whether the depreciation in the peso
will translate into inflation,'' said Santander currency analyst,
Jorge de Gotari. If this is just over speculation and the central
bank, Banco de Mexico (Banxico) will modify its inflation target
based on the peso's weakness, then let the markets decide where the
peso lands.
	   Analysts fear Banxico will tighten the monetary policy to help
keep inflation in check. A weak currency usually means import
prices rise, causing inflation to climb.
	   The current government inflation target is 12 percent but the
market expects over 13 percent.
	   The recovery comes on the heels of Clinton's promise Sunday to
mobilize more aid for Russia to help revive its battered economy.
Recently, emerging markets have suffered the ripple effects of
Asia's economic crisis as foreign investors opted for the
safe-haven economies of Europe, Canada and the United States. ``All
indications are that money is starting to flow back into emerging
markets,'' said Felipe Garcia an economist with IDA in New York.
	   ``I don't know whether it is just bottom fishing, but prices are
depressed so we are at good levels to build positions back up
again.''
	   Brazil's benchmark index recovered 5.6 percent from Monday's
2.5-percent loss after the government intervened to lower interest
rates. The Russian index also made a comeback, rising 12 percent.
	   This was extremely encouraging, said Jorge de Gotari, a currency
analyst with Mexican brokerage firm Santander in New York.
	   ``It implies that investors are finally starting to
differentiate among emerging markets.''
	   Analysts have been complaining that investors were lumping all
emerging markets into the same asset class without looking closer
at the individual countries' fundamentals.
	   In Mexico's case, though yields in the short-term treasury bills
(cetes) rose for the fifth consecutive week, the high level of
foreign interest - particularly in the longer term bonds - implied
investors maintain a positive outlook for Mexico's longer-term
fundamentals.
	   The strongest demand was seen in the six-month cetes at 21.15
over 20.99 last week.

With Kosovo Annan recommends strengthening UN military presence in Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Because of increasing violence in Kosovo,
U.N. chief Kofi Annan on Wednesday suggested keeping U.N.
peacekeepers in neighboring Macedonia until at least next year and
raised the possibility of sending more U.N. troops to the area.
	   The 750-member force, which includes nearly 340 Americans, was
sent to the Balkans in 1992 to prevent the spread of the ethnic
conflict in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
	   Last December, the Security Council granted a ``final
extension'' of the mandate until Aug. 31, and Russian Ambassador
Sergey Lavrov said at the time there ``could be no question'' that
the troops would leave thereafter.
	   But in a report to the council, Annan said that in light of
increased violence in Kosovo and discussions within NATO about an
``expanded international presence in the region,'' it would be
``premature to proceed with a decision to withdraw'' the force.
	   Annan suggested the council consider maintaining the force in
Macedonia until at least Feb. 28, 1999. He said he would submit a
report next month with ``specific proposals on a possible
strengthening of the force's overall capacity.''
	   He did not say whether that might include additional troops or
new equipment. But Annan said the peacekeepers had already
increased its patrols along the Macedonian border with Kosovo, a
province of the Serb republic of Yugoslavia, and had established
24-hour observation posts.
	   ``Such intensive monitoring, however, cannot be sustained over a
long period of time with the current troop strength,'' he said.
	   Annan also noted that the host government, officially known as
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, had asked that the
troops remain. Last month, NATO foreign ministers also recommended
the U.N. troops stay in Macedonia
	   At their meeting in Luxembourg, the NATO ministers agreed on
increased cooperation to help Albania and Macedonia patrol their
borders and joint-exercises with forces from the two Balkan
nations.
	   The ministers also agreed to step up assistance programs under
which NATO has been sending small teams of military advisors to
help them secure their borders with Kosovo. They also decided to
hold maneuvers in Albania with land and air forces in August.
	   Planned joint-exercises September in Macedonia will be upgraded.
	   The U.N. operation, formally known as the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force, includes troops from six nations. They
are Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Norway and Sweden in addition to
the United States.

Aeromexico's Sales Fall Following Strike Concern, THE NEWS

	   Aeromexico has suffered a 15-percent fall in sales due to its
conflict with the National Flight Attendants' Union (ASSA),
Director General of Aeromexico Alfonso Pasquel said Tuesday. The
flight attendants' strike for better pay and working conditions,
due to start last Monday, would have grounded flights but was
averted at the last minute by the Transport and Communications
Secretariat's temporary takeover of Aeromexico. The secretariat
justified the move, which allows it to hire replacement workers if
they strike, on the grounds that the strike would severely disrupt
services to parts of the country where Aeromexico is the only
carrier.
	   Flight attendants are wearing black and red armbands and have
plastered Aeromexico offices in the city center with black and red
banners in protest.
	   Union leaders were expected to meet senior management to start
talks Tuesday night. Both sides have said that they will offer no
new proposals.
	   The Secretary General of ASSA, Alejandra Barrelas, slammed what
she called the government's ``unconstitutional'' behavior Tuesday
and reaffirmed the union's rejection of the deal offered by
Aeromexico. She announced that the union is exploring the legality
of the government action under Mexican and North Atlantic Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) law. However, an analyst who wished to
remain anonymous doubted its chances of success, ``I think the
requisition is totally legal and in line with the constitution,''
he said.
	   ASSA had demanded a 19-percent pay rise and been offered 18
percent by Aeromexico but differences over working conditions and
benefits prevented a settlement. Pasquel said the union's demands
were unreasonable and were equivalent to a 103-percent increase
once benefits had been taken into account and Aeromexico's offer
represented a 23-percent rise in real terms. The analyst said that
this is in line with wage inflation of about 20 percent for the
past year. Aeromexico already has the third highest costs in the
world, Pasquel said, and claimed such an increase would cripple the
company.
	   The dispute comes at a time when Cintra, Aeromexico's holding
company, is only just recovering from a shaky period.
	   Although Cintra reported profits of 1.88 billion pesos in 1997
but first quarter earnings for 1998 were down by 68 percent to
147.9 million pesos compared to the same period in 1997 due to a
fall in sales, Aeromexico said. Aeromexico has also been investing
in new and renovating old planes, the anonymous analyst said, and
their seat occupancy has increased by about 6 percent - a high
figure.
	   The Cintra holding group was formed in 1995 to take over the
heavily-indebted and near-bankrupt Aeromexico and Mexicana
airlines. Debt was swapped for shares and a coalition of banks
became the new shareholders --the government being the majority
owner through Fobaproa (the bank bailout fund). The government had
announced plans to sell off its 50-percent stake before the end of
1998 now that the companies have been restructured.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Rwanda's efforts to restore social
stability through economic reforms were boosted Wednesday when
donor nations and international institutions pledged dlrs 250
million in support.
	   The funding for the small central African country where some
500,000 people died in ethnic slaughter in 1994 was negotiated at a
two-day meeting in the Swedish capital organized by the World Bank
and the Rwandan government.
	   The funds are not targeted for specific programs, said Nils
Tcheyan, the World Bank's country director for Rwanda. They are
intended to give Rwanda the capacity to follow through on a variety
of programs ranging from privatization to improving the health and
education systems.
	   Rwanda currently has debts of some dlrs 1.3 billion, Rwandan
Finance Minister Donald Kaberuka said at a news conference. At
least dlrs 34 million of the funds pldged on Wednesday is earmarked
to help Rwanda service that debt, Tcheyan said.
	   Kaberuka on Monday had appealed for more than dlrs 750 million
in support, but said the amount pledged on Wednesday was a
substantial step forward ``in the struggle for development and
national reconciliation.''
	   Most of the money is to be disbursed within the next 12 months,
Tcheyan said.
	   The meeting included representatives from Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United
States. Multilateral institutions at the talks included the African
Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in
Africa.

Turkey's beloved national drink to be privatized 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Raki, Turkey's powerful, anise-flavored
alcoholic drink, may soon be produced by brewers other than Turks.
	   The government plans to end the 66-year-long state monopoly on
the production of alcoholic beverages, and a draft bill, submitted
to Parliament this week, has already attracted the attention of
some 30 foreign and Turkish producers, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Among those reportedly interested are the Montreal-based Seagram
Co., France's Groupe Pernod Ricard and Britain's UDV. All have
applied to the government to produce Raki along with wine and beer,
the daily Sabah reported.
	   The privatization of the state-run Spirit and Tobacco
Administration is aimed at complying with a customs union deal with
the European Union, EU, that requires the elimination of state
monopolies.
	   The 1995 customs deal is designed to make Turkish firms more
competitive within the EU. Along with the privatization of spirit
factories, the government also moved to lift the state monopoly on
tobacco production.
	   To protect the drink's reputation, the government registered its
name as a trademark.
	   The Turks spent dlrs 536 million on Raki and dlrs 923 million on
beer last year.

Candidates set for assembly elections in Northern Ireland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's parties
completed nominations for their new assembly Wednesday, with the
leading foes of compromise eagerly bidding for influence in the new
body.
	   Elections of 108 assembly members on June 25 will be a key step
in implementing the agreement reached among eight parties and the
British and Irish governments in April, and ratified by voters
across Ireland on May 22.
	   Within the Protestant majority, the election shapes up as a
rerun of the bitter referendum campaign in which Protestant
``unionists'' were evenly split between supporters and opponents of
the agreement. Having lost the referendum battle, opponents now
hope to win enough seats to gain a strong say in how the assembly
works _ or fails.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party
and the chief campaigner against the accord, will be running for a
seat. Among his opponents will be Joe Cahill, a reputed former
commander of the Irish Republican Army in Belfast and now a senior
figure in the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   To protect the interests of the Catholic minority in Northern
Ireland, the assembly will not legislate by a simple majority. Any
issue designated a ``key question'' cannot be passed without
backing of a majority from both Catholic ``nationalist'' and
Protestant ``unionist'' politicians.
	   The largest party in the assembly is likely to be the Ulster
Unionist Party, led by David Trimble, a supporter of the agreement.
	   Trimble said Wednesday that his party would campaign under the
slogan ``Together Within the Union,'' stressing that Northern
Ireland remains under British rule while regaining a measure of
local autonomy.
	   ``We are moving together into this new situation and we are
saying to the people of Northern Ireland, `This is our chance to
actually achieve something. This is for real,' '' Trimble said.
	   Referring to Paisley's forces, Trimble said unionists were fed
up with a ``permanent position in the trenches, surviving on a drip
feed of old rhetoric, redundant fears and laughable stunts.''
	   While the Ulster Unionists battle against Paisley's side,
interest on the Catholic nationalist side will focus on the
competition between Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, led by John Hume. Sinn Fein's support has grown
significantly since the first IRA cease-fire in 1994, and there has
been speculation that it is primed to overtake Hume's party.

<TEXT>
	   ALPE DI PAMPEAGO, Italy (AP) _ Pavel Tonkov edged overall leader
Marco Pantani by one second Wednesday to claim the 18th stage of
the Tour of Italy after the race's top two riders made a late
breakaway on the final climb in the Alps.
	   The tough, 115-kilometer (71.3-mile) stage ended at an altitude
of 1,760 meters (5,808 feet) above sea level.
	   Pantani finished second for the second straight stage, and held
onto the pink jersey heading into the last four days. The Italian
leads Tonkov, the 1996 Giro champion and runner-up last year, by 27
seconds in the overall standings.
	   ``I'm not made of steel. I'll give my all again tomorrow, but my
adversaries are strong,'' Tonkov said. ``Marco Pantani was in
brilliant shape. He pedaled strongly going uphill.''
	   Favorite Alex Zuelle, who had dominated the cycling classic
until it headed into the mountains, lost more time Wednesday. He
faltered on the final uphill pass and was fourth, 58 seconds behind
Russia's Tonkov. Nicola Miceli was third Wednesday.
	   Zuelle now trails Pantani by more than two minutes overall.
	   Colombia's Chepe Gonzales rode alone at the lead for more than
40 kilometers (25 miles), but was eventually caught by a pack of 22
riders heading into the final climb.
	   Zuelle tried to take off ahead of the leaders but was reeled in,
setting the stage for Tonkov and Pantani to break away with 4
kilometers (2.5 miles) left.
	   Tonkov was clocked in 3 hours, 36 minutes, 53 seconds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli and Syrian negotiators met for the
first time in more than two years this week in the United States,
Israel TV reported Wednesday.
	   The TV said three Israeli negotiators and three Syrian
representatives including the Syrian ambassador to Washington Walid
Moualem held four days of meetings at a think tank run by former
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III in Houston, Texas.
	   Israel TV said Baker and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk were both present at the meetings which dealt with a
return to the negotiating table both sides left over two years ago.
	   Syria wants the Golan Heights back, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast war, in exchange for a peace agreement. Talks on a
territorial compromise with Israel's previous Labor-led government
broke off in March 1996 and never resumed.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Syria to
returned to talks by has also said that Israel should retain
control over the strategic heights for security reasons.
	   Israel TV said the secret talks this week in Houston were
attended by Netanyahu's chief policy aide Uzi Arad, Itamar
Rabinovitz, a former ambassador and negotiator with Syria and
reserve general Uzi Sagay.

Butler to lay out ``road map'' for Iraq to follow to end of sanctions Richardson says Butler delivered ``devastating blow'' to Iraq's credibility; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with morning session over,
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Dealing what the U.S. ambassador called a
``devastating blow'' to Iraq's credibility, the chief U.N.
inspector used photos, charts and records to press his claim
Baghdad is still hiding illegal
	   weapons.
	   Richard Butler presented his evidence before the Security
Council in an effort to convince the 15 members that Iraq has still
failed to comply with U.N. orders to destroy all long-range
missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the council to lift sanctions
imposed in August 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed illegal materials, and Russia,
France, China and others have been pressuring the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, which Butler heads, to back up his claims to
the contrary.
	   ``UNSCOM has dealt a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility,''
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said after the morning session.
``UNSCOM has produced documents, charts that catalogue the gaps and
inconsistencies in Iraqi claims in the chemical, biological and
other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
by Iraq and that Baghdad still has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions. ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to
do,'' he said.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said it was clear ``there are a
number of unanswered questions'' even in the field of missiles, one
of the areas where the United Nations said progress in disarmament
had been made.
	   The council was to resume its closed-door session later
Wednesday.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection
	   program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as Saddam
remains in power.
	   Butler and his staff have appeared frequently before the council
since inspections began in 1991. But U.N. officials said Butler is
expected to provide far more technical information and detailed
evidence than in previous
	   presentations because of pressure within the council to bring
the program to an end.
	   On Tuesday, the council listened to an Iraqi delegation, led by
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argue that it has
complied with U.N. orders and that sanctions should be ended.
British and American diplomats said Iraq provided no new
information about its weapons programs.
	   Pressure has increased on Butler's teams since Secretary-General
Kofi Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open
Saddam's palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access
	   But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors to declare
Iraq free or
	   weapons or prove it is not.

	   A writ petition challenging the four bills on Chittagong Hill
Tracts was not moved in the High Court on Tuesday.
	   The writ challenging the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Regional
Council Act 1998 and three Hill Districts Local Government Council
(Amendments) Acts 1998 was filed by BNP leader Barrister Rafiqul
Islam Mia on Monday.
	   It was scheduled to be moved in the court of Justice AM Mahmudur
Rahman and Justice Md Mozammel Hossain. But Barrister Rafiq did not
appear in the court to move his writ.
	   However, BNP leaders Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Shaikh Razzak Ali
and Habibul Islam Bhuyian were present in the court.
	   Party sources said BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia had asked
Mia Monday night over telephone not to move the writ as it was
beyond the decision of the party. Some BNP leaders were also
instructed to see that the writ was not moved.
	   BNP and its six allies have called for a long march towards
Chittagong Hill Tracts on June 9 to press for scrapping of the four
bills.
	   In the writ, petitioner Aung Yong Murong of Roma thana in
Bandarban district prayed for a rule upon the government to show
cause as to why the four bills should not be declared to have been
passed by the Parliament without lawful authority.
	   The writ also sought a stay order on the operation of CHT
Regional Council Act 1998 and three Hill Districts Local Government
Council (Amendment) Acts 1998 till disposal of the rule.
	   Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs
and Secretary, Special Affairs Division had been made respondents
to the writ petition.
	   It was stated in the petition that the government, by enacting
the four laws, had violated Articles 1, 27, 28 (1), 29 (1), 36, 42,
52, 60, 143, 144 and 145 of the Constitution.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The prospect of a World Cup undermined by travel
chaos grew Wednesday, with Air France pilots striking for a third
day, and other pay disputes threatening to paralyze the transport
sector.
	   Baggage handlers stayed off the job, forcing passengers to carry
their own luggage for a second day at Paris' biggest airport. The
capital's subway workers planned a metro strike and national
railworkers prepared a walkout, as did airline mechanics.
	   Top French government ministers and World Cup officials appeared
embarrassed by the labor unrest, which could derail the world's
biggest international sporting event.
	   ``For a few days France will be the focal point of the world.
The welcome must be truly exceptional, even perfect,'' said
President Jacques Chirac while visiting the French squad at their
training camp outside Paris.
	   ``I hope everybody will show a spirit of responsibility.''
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement criticized the pilots'
``lack of civic-mindedness,'' saying he felt ``sadness, almost
shame.''
	   Chevenement told Radio Monte Carlo, ``France could show itself
as a nation that can't organize a world event anymore.''
	   Jacques Lambert, director of the World Cup organizing committee,
said he hoped reason would prevail.
	   ``If not, it will be a serious setback for all the work we've
been doing for five years to stage the tournament as well as
possible,'' Lambert said.
	   Talks at Air France resumed at 3:20 p.m. (1320 GMT) Wednesday,
after no progress was reported from the first round Tuesday.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta predicted ``long and
difficult'' bargaining.
	   But the head of the union that represents most of the airline's
3,200 pilots softened his tone, saying the pilots understood the
need to cut costs to make the company competetive.
	   In the meantime, Air France said its Wednesday schedule included
only 17 percent of its usual long-distance flights, 30 percent of
its short and medium-distance routes from Charles de Gaulle Airport
and 43 percent from Orly.
	   The company wants to give the pilots, among the highest paid in
the world, stock in exchange for 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in pay cuts. And it's offered to eventually eliminate a
two-tier salary schedule that pays less to new pilots.
	   Air France pilots average 1 million francs (dlrs 160,000), the
airline said.
	   The carrier, which reported a profit in the last two years,
could lose 100 million francs (dlrs 16.7 million) per day during
the strike.
	   Lambert, the World Cup official, said Air France could guarantee
travel throughout the tournament for all participating teams.
	   The airline's mechanics threatened Wednesday to walk off the job
over pay grievances. Paris subway drivers with the Communist-led
CGT union were to walk off the job Thursday.
	   At the national railway SNCF, conductors with three unions were
to strike Friday night though Sunday evening. Its engineers
announced plans for a June 10 strike, the day the World Cup opens.

	   The teachers of the non-government primary schools continued
their hunger strike unto death for the third consecutive day in the
city's Osmani Uddyan on Tuesday.
	   The Bangladesh Non-government Primary Teachers Association
launched the action programme since Sunday last pressing for the
realisation of their five-point demands. The demands of the
teachers include nationalisation of all the registered primary
schools and payment of salaries similar to that enjoyed by the
government primary school teachers from July, 1996.
	   The government on Tuesday initiated an informal dialogue with
the leaders of the Association. The dialogue lasted for about three
hours from 3 pm at the Central Office of the Awami League at
Bangabandhu Avenue. The talks between the leaders of the
non-government primary school teachers and ruling party ended
without any result, said an insider of the meeting.
	   A source said that the government side at the talks requested
the Association leaders to withdraw their action programme first.
Then they would arrange a meeting between the Prime Minister and
the Association leaders, the source added. Most of the striking
teachers opposed the proposal and expressed their opinion in favour
of continuing the action programme, it further added.
	   The Association was represented, among others, by Shamsul Alam,
Akkas Ali Sheikh, Hasanuzzaman Ratan and Khairul Kabir while Amir
Hossain Amu, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and Nurul Islam Nahid
represented the Awami League at the talks.
	   On the third day of their hunger strike programme on Tuesday, a
total of 102 teachers participated. Of them four fell ill. Three of
them were taken to the ICDDRB while another was admitted to the
Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said the Organising Secretary of
the Association Mriganka Mohan Saha.
	   Jatiya Party Chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad and Secretary
General Naziur Rahman Manjur visited the striking teachers in the
morning. They expressed solidarity with the action programme of the
teachers.
	   Besides, former Chairman of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society
Shahidul Huq Jamal, Joint Secretary General of Islami Shashantantra
Andolan Hemayetuddin, leaders of Ganotantrik Chhatra Oikya and
Bangladesh Chhatra Union also visited the teachers on Tuesday.

Butler to lay out ``road map'' for Iraq to follow to end of sanctions Richardson says Butler delivered ``devastating blow'' to Iraq's credibility; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with morning session over,
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Dealing what the U.S. ambassador called a
``devastating blow'' to Iraq's credibility, the chief U.N.
inspector used photos, charts and records to press his claim that
Baghdad is still hiding illegal weapons.
	   Richard Butler presented his evidence before the Security
Council in an effort to convince the 15 members that Iraq has still
failed to comply with U.N. orders to destroy all long-range
missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the council to lift sanctions
imposed in August 1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait, touching off the Gulf conflict.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed illegal materials, and Russia,
France, China and others have been pressuring the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, which Butler heads, to back up his claims to
the contrary.
	   ``UNSCOM has dealt a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility,''
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said after the morning session.
``UNSCOM has produced documents, charts that catalogue the gaps and
inconsistencies in Iraqi claims in the chemical, biological and
other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
by Iraq and that Baghdad still has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions. ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to
do,'' he said.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said it was clear ``there are a
number of unanswered questions'' even in the field of missiles, one
of the areas where the United Nations said progress in disarmament
had been made.
	   The council was to resume its closed-door session later
Wednesday.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as
Saddam remains in power.
	   Butler and his staff have appeared frequently before the council
since inspections began in 1991. But U.N. officials said Butler is
expected to provide far more technical information and detailed
evidence than in previous presentations because of pressure within
the council to bring the program to an end.
	   On Tuesday, the council listened to an Iraqi delegation, led by
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argue that it has
complied with U.N. orders and that sanctions should be ended.
British and American diplomats said Iraq provided no new
information about its weapons programs.
	   Pressure has increased on Butler's teams since Secretary-General
Kofi Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open
Saddam's palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rainstorms and a shortage of
helicopters and fuel hampered international efforts Wednesday to
get aid to survivors of a deadly earthquake in northern Afghanistan
that killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   Food appeared to be the biggest need after urgent medical
supplies.
	   The extent of the damage caused by Saturday's 6.9 magnitude
earthquake still was unclear Wednesday as helicopters located
remote devastated villages not even on the aid agency's maps. The
earthquake triggered landslides, sending mountain villages into the
valleys and obliterating others.
	   In the village of Regi perched on a peak at the end of a deep
valley, about half of the 110 houses had been completely destroyed.
In the ruins, the bodies of 11 people lay buried. Medical teams
treated the wounded.
	   More health problems lay ahead in part because landslides buried
the villages' fresh water supply and the nearest source of clean
water is now 20 kilometers (12 miles) away.
	   With dwindling food stocks, villagers were cooking grass, said
journalists aboard the helicopters.
	   The World Food Program has managed to get 1.5 tons of wheat,
vegetable oil and high-protein biscuits by helicopter to remote
Shari Basurkh, very close to the epicenter.
	   As many as 10,000 people could be facing serious food shortages,
said Rupert Collevile, a U.N. spokesman in Faisabad, the provincial
capital.
	   In Rostaq _ heavily damaged by Saturday's quake and the site of
an earlier earthquake in February that killed 2,300 people _ the
United Nations will be setting up bakeries to feed the hungriest.
Temporary shelter and clean water also were high priorities for
humanitarian workers.
	   ``There is plenty of water,'' said Chris Johnson, a water
quality specialist with the Oxfam charity, during a brief respite
in the steady rain that turned roads in the Faisabad region into
fordable rivers. ``The majority of it is filthy.''
	   The earthquakes, about three months apart, highlighted severe
public health problems that already existed in the remote poverty
stricken regions of Afghanistan.
	   Many of the people who sought medical treatment from the aid
helicopters that touched down appeared to be suffering from
diseases for a long time.
	   But the quake has worsened already dismal public hygiene. In
Regi the stench of the carcasses of dead animals hung heavy in the
air, said journalists who visited the village on Wednesday. Many
human bodies had yet to be recovered from the rubble.
	   In the village of Rostaq, where the quake had crushed 140
students in a school run by the Swedish-Afghan Committee, founded
by Olaf Palma, 40 men with horses and donkeys were trying to dig
out the dead.
	   Logistical problems continued to plague aid workers scrambling
to get the considerable supplies of food, blankets, tents and
plastic sheetings they have for the victims.
	   The United Nations and the International Red Cross together have
three helicopters, but the United Nations has put out an appeal for
more helicopters.
	   However, heavy rains forced several flights to return to
Pakistan still laden with their supplies.
	   The relentless rain in the area has increased the need to hurry
emergency tents and plastic sheeting for thousands of people
sleeping outdoors _ too frightened of another earthquake to go
inside, said Sarah Russell, a spokesperson in neighboring Pakistan.
	   The United States has offered to find two 20-ton cargo
helicopters to assist in the relief efforts.
	   ``If the U.S. succeeds in finding these helicopters, it will be
fantastic news,'' said Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, U.N. Coordinator
for Afghanistan.

Inkatha members, right-wing Nazis, get amnesty 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ In a dark night shortly before
South Africa's historic first democratic elections, black Zulu
nationalists and right-wing white Nazis raided a police station in
KwaZulu-Natal to steal firearms.
	   During the raid in March 1994, they killed one policeman,
wounded two others and stole weapons, the five men told the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission, which is investigating apartheid-era
crimes.
	   On Wednesday, the panel chaired by Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu
granted amnesty to four applicants. The fifth, James Zulu, was
killed earlier this year in an unrelated event.
	   Zulu and Morton Christie were members of the Inkatha Freedom
Party, a black Zulu nationalist group, that collaborated with the
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement),
a right-wing white group, for political convenience.
	   The panel also granted amnesty to AWB members Harry Jardine and
Christo Brand. Morton Christie was a member of both Inkatha and
AWB, the panel said.
	   The four men told the panel that their intent in raiding the
police station was to arm themselves against African National
Congress operatives in political infighting that has claimed more
than 10,000 lives in the last decade.
	   With recent weapons thefts from an army base in Bloemfontein,
the government is nervous about a resurgence of similar violence
prior to next year's national elections.
	   The ANC won the April 1994 elections.
	   To obtain amnesty, applicants must convince the panel they are
telling the truth and that they acted out of political motives.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government will soon ratify an International
Labor Union (ILO) convention on the freedom of association and
protection of the right to organize, Minister of Manpower Fahmi
Idris promised yesterday.
	   Fahmi is scheduled to announce Indonesia's new stance on
workers' rights to assemble during his address, planned for next
Tuesday, during the ILO's three-week convention in Geneva.
	   President B.J. Habibie will sign a presidential decree to adopt
ILO Convention No. 87. Given the short time available, the decree
will then be submitted to the House of Representatives for
deliberation and final ratification, Fahmi said.
	   ``Up to now we have been regarded as a country which does not
support the protection of human rights, fails to give freedom for
workers,'' Fahmi conceded in a media briefing after he met with
President B.J. Habibie at the Bina Graha presidential office.
	   Fahmi was accompanied by Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   ``With this ratification Indonesia now adopts the policy that
any labor organizations are allowed to operate as long as they
abide by the prevailing laws,'' he said.
	   During former president Soeharto's 32-year tenure, the
government only recognized the Federation of All Indonesian Workers
Union (FSPSI).
	   With the adoption of the convention, the government will allow
at least two more trade unions, including the hitherto banned
Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union (SBSI), Fahmi said. Another new
union will also be formally recognized, he added, but did not
elaborate.
	   Muchtar Pakpahan established SBSI in 1992; it was banned two
years later. Pakpahan was also sentenced to a four-year prison term
for allegedly instigating a labor riot in Medan, North Sumatra in
1994.
	   The ILO annual meeting in Geneva has in previous years been
marked by an international call to the government to release
Pakpahan and to recognize the independent labor union.
	   Soeharto's administration persistently ignored the call.
Soeharto even turned down U.S. President Bill Clinton's appeal to
him in November to allow Pakpahan to travel abroad for medical
treatment.
	   Habibie released Pakpahan and another government critic, Sri
Bintang Pamungkas, from jail last month.
	   Fahmi informed Pakpahan Monday of the government's decision to
recognize SBSI.
	   Pakpahan will accompany Fahmi at the Geneva meeting and will act
as one of his advisors, along with FSPSI leaders.
	   ``The labor union (representatives) will act as advisors,
including Pakpahan,'' said the minister.
	   SBSI and FSPSI jointly urged the ILO on Monday to press
Indonesia to adopt ILO conventions in order to ensure the
protection of workers' rights.
	   FSPSI's Ali Samioen hoped the government would agree to adopt
and ratify Convention No. 87, Convention No. 105 on the abolition
of forced labor, Convention No. 111 on the discrimination of
employment and occupation and Convention No. 138 on minimum wages.
	   The minister, a successful businessman, also called on
financially able companies to voluntarily raise their workers'
wages although Soeharto froze minimum regional wage levels
following the collapse of many companies in the economic slump.
	   ``There are several sectors which are actually able to increase
wages including the plantation, cigarette, tobacco and food and
beverage sectors,'' the minister noted, adding that he would
directly persuade companies to improve workers' welfare.
	   He estimated that at least 15.4 million people would be
unemployed by the end of this year as the economy is expected to
contract by up to 10 percent.
	   ``The Ministry of Manpower is facing an extraordinary problem,
and we will adopt several policies (to solve it),'' Fahmi said.

Reputed Montenegro mafia boss is gunned down in Slovenia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Veselin Jovovic, reputed to be the
head of the Montenego mafia in Slovenia, Wednesday was shot and
killed by a lone gunman in a Ljubljana restaurant, police reported.
	   A waitress at the restaurant said that an unknown man entered
the restaurant, asked for a cup of coffee, then pulled a pistol and
shot Jovovic, known as Veso, in the head. He died on the spot.
	   The gunman escaped immediately afterward. His motive was
unclear, but police theorized that Jovovic was the victim of
revenge killing.
	   Slovenia's police squad fighting organized crime, in a
spectacular operation two months ago, arrested Jovovic, whom they
accused of racketeering. But prosecutors set him free shortly
afterward for lack of evidence.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian stock market rallied for a second day
Wednesday, buoyed by rumors that the country's flailing economy
might soon be rescued by a hefty international aid package.
	   However, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, arriving in Paris for
talks with French officials, continued to play down the rumors, and
a Finance Ministry spokesman reiterated that Moscow hasn't sought
emergency aid _ at least not formally.
	   ``The Russian government hasn't officially turned to foreign
financial institutions with a request for emergency aid,''
spokesman Oleg Zhukov said. However, he did say the government is
negotiating about new borrowing from Western commercial banks, and
possibly from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kiriyenko and other top government officials have been insisting
that Russia can pull itself out of its financial chasm with only
minimal help from the West.
	   To that end, the government issued rare one-week treasury bills
in a desperate attempt to bolster its treasury and stabilize its
turbulent financial markets.
	   The government sold most of the issue by midday, agreeing to
one-week yields of an average 40 percent.
	   ``This indicates reasonably strong demand,'' said Robert Devane,
head of fixed income at Moscow brokerage Troika-Dialog.
	   The Kremlin also announced that it would be cutting natural gas,
electricity and railroad freight rates in an effort to stimulate
the economy. It didn't say how much the prices would fall.
	   The moves are aimed at ending a crisis that began last week with
a steep drop in the Russian stock market and has threatened to
trigger a costly devaluation of the ruble.
	   The stock exchange has regained significant ground in the past
two days, rising 12 percent Tuesday and 8 percent Wednesday,
largely on the assumption that aid from the West was on its way.
	   ``Traders were more sure today that there will be help,'' said
Mikhail Dorfman, a trader at the ATON brokerage in Moscow.
	   Moreover, the ruble has been steady in recent days without major
support from Central Bank, which says it has plenty of reserves
left to prevent a run on the currency.
	   Altogether, the Russian stock market is down about 50 percent
from the beginning of the year _ the world's worst performance and
a sharp change from the previous year's record growth of 98
percent.
	   The new treasury bills offered Wednesday are designed to raise
quick cash so Russia can keep up with payments on its existing debt
and reassure investors that it will not default.
	   There had been speculation that Kiriyenko's trip to Paris _ his
first trip abroad as prime minister _ would lead to an announcement
of an emergency bailout plan by the IMF or the Group of Eight
industrialized nations.
	   Speaking to reporters after his arrival, the prime minister said
Russia needed to improve its economic integration with the West,
but said he had not come to France primarily to see financial aid.
	   ``The issue is not aid concretely for Russia,'' Kiriyenko said
responding to a question about whether he would ask French leaders
for support of a bailout package.
	   He also called on the European Union to give Russia freer access
_ ``equal conditions and equal opportunities''_ to its markets.

France throws open her doors for World Cup, but the welcome mat is daunting controversy AP Special Correspondent

EDS: ADDS quote from President Chirac, details of World Cup ticket

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France has thrown open her doors for the 1998 World
Cup, but _ what with strikes, demonstrations and chaos _ furious
visitors are having to fight their way across the welcome mat.
	   ``This place is a catastrophe, a national humiliation,''
muttered Amer Houari, a Parisian cabbie who waited three hours for
an airport fare despite long lines of passengers desperate for a
taxi.
	   ``And tomorrow is likely to be even worse,'' he added. ``It
seems like the only thing we French are good at is wreaking
havoc.''
	   Air France pilots struck Monday, canceling up to 90 percent of
international flights by the official World Cup carrier a little
over a week before the kickoff of a month of matches.
	   The pilots threatened to stay out for two weeks, but talks
continued in an effort to find a compromise.
	   President Jacques Chirac, visiting the French squad Wednesday at
its training camp outside Paris, called for all concerned to show
``responsibility.''
	   ``For a few days France will be the focal point of the world.
The welcome must be truly exceptional, even perfect,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Paris is already jammed for the French Open tennis
tournament and the annual French arms fair at Le Bourget airport.
	   Passengers who managed to find alternate flights to Charles de
Gaulle Airport discovered that baggage handlers were also on
strike, and luggage was dumped into a roiling sidewalk crowd
outside.
	   ``Is Paris always like this?'' asked Lily Goh, from Singapore,
as her delicate orchid corsage wilted in the chaotic crush. ``We
spent 13 hours flying and 10 hours waiting for our bags.''
	   Her husband, who had come to set up a World Cup exhibition, was
seeking their luggage among a multinational maelstrom of families,
business travelers, confused policemen and customs officers.
	   Marilyn Barry, a New Yorker who had organized a canal barge trip
for friends and family, gave up trying to locate a group which had
come in on another airline. Her humor was wearing thin.
	   ``What a disgrace,'' repeated Marguerite Tinguy, a Frenchwoman,
as she tried to find someone to answer questions.
	   At the airport information booth, hostesses shrugged, as bemused
as everyone else. Police officers brusquely refused help,
preoccupied with a snarl of buses, baggage trucks and people
pushing carts.
	   By afternoon, airlines simply gave up, and passengers had to lug
their own bags from planeside while baggage handlers watched,
amused.
	   And few of the new arrivals were aware of what was in store in
the days to follow.
	   Vague threats of terrorism hang in the air. Police arrested
three more people Wednesday because of intelligence that Islamic
groups may try to disrupt the Cup. So far, 90 suspects have been
detained around Europe.
	   On Thursday, left-leaning unions plan a ``national day of
action,'' including mass rallies at crucial points around Paris and
marches that would paralyze main thoroughfares.
	   Eight separate demonstrations were planned by workers in
transport, energy, public services, health, construction and
commerce.
	   Strikes were expected to at least partially disrupt the Paris
metro on Thursday and long-distance trains on Friday.
	   In addition, railway workers called a one-day strike for June
10, the day the World Cup opens. It was not clear which trains
would be affected.
	   For most Frenchmen, ire seemed directed at Air France pilots for
exploiting the World Cup to dramatize their wage complaints.
	   As the state airline privatizes, pilots have rejected a plan to
receive stock in exchange for lower wages. Some Air France captains
earn more than dlrs 200,000 a year, 40 per cent more than
comparable Lufthansa salaries.
	   National political leaders condemned ``a shameful
embarrassment'' after four years of planning for a trouble-free
World Cup.
	   For many, just getting to the World Cup was a non-starter after
most tickets were sold to French supporters, infuriating foreign
fans and prompting a lawsuit from members of the European
Parliament.
	   ``It's the World Cup, not the France Cup,'' howled Philip
Jenkinson, the MEPs' chief counsel.
	   Extra tickets were put on sale to curb the anger _ but one
number was for French callers, the other for the rest of Europe.
	   Some French shrugged off the transport dispute as yet another
manifestation of workers' right to strike.
	   The popular Paris tabloid daily ``Liberation'' caught the mood,
a mixture of outrage and perverse pride, with its Tuesday front
page.
	   A drawing showed a blue-white-red airplane with the grinning
face of a beret-wearing Frenchman in place of the nose. The wings
were formed by a long baguette sandwich clamped in his teeth.
	   The headline read: ``Pilots: A Strike Like Only the French Can
Manage.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie urged the people yesterday
to put aside differences about his administration's legitimacy to
work with the government to restore the country's economy.
	   Promising his Cabinet would do its utmost to carry out reforms
in all spheres of life, he said it would not be able to finish its
tasks overnight.
	   Habibie also assured the nation that he would always position
himself as the leaderof the country's 202 million people, although
he realized that not everybody supported him.
	   ``Without any previous plan or expectation, I received the honor
to lead the Indonesian people, including those who are not happy
with me, and even lead those who possibly plan to kill me,'' he
said in a meeting with 45 leaders of the Indonesian Buddhist
Council (Walubi) and Indonesian Hindu Dharma Council (PHDI) at Bina
Graha presidential office.
	   People should focus their energy and attention on the future and
not waste time rehashing the past, he said.
	   ``Total reform is for the future, not for the past... It does
not mean that we do not want to learn from our mistakes, we learn
from ours and other people's mistakes.''
	   The President pointed out that the country's most pressing
problem was how to revive the economy -- especially as it would
likely contract by 10 percent this year -- although political and
legal reforms were no less important.
	   ``However, as we are too impatient to carry out reforms, we
forget unemployment problems, forget poor people who actually do
not care whoever becomes their president, vice president or
ministers, because what is important for them is what to eat.''
	   The new government will prioritize assistance for small and
medium companies as 70 percent of employment is provided bythis
sector, he said.
	   ``I do realize during this monetary crisis small and medium
scale businesses are in fact the most economically resilient.''
	   The President said he was confident the country's reform
policies were on track and had even won praise from the
international community, including the International Monetary
Fund's Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss.
	   ``We'll just wait for the realization of his statement about the
organization's (plan) to assist Indonesia in overcoming the
crisis.''
	   Habibie also expressed his concern about groups of people who
claimed they spoke on behalf of people when they were only seeking
to further their personal agendas.
	   ``I am not blind, and not deaf, my friends are not only national
leaders but also ordinary people,'' he said.
	   The meeting is part of a series of conferences with various
community leaders to receive input from them and for Habibie to
provide information about his programs.
	   During a meeting with leaders of the Indonesian Ulemas Council
(MUI) on Friday, he told them that a fresh poll would be held next
year and the government would allow people to set up their own
political parties.
	   On Monday, he assured leaders of the Indonesian Communion of
Churches (PGI) and Indonesian Bishops Conference (KWI) that the
government would guarantee freedom of religion.

Psychiatrists see sports violence as dangerous influence on kids 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Moving also on general news lines.
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Psychiatrists have become increasingly worried
that when pro athletes lash out _ with fists, baseballs aimed at
opposing players or a chomp of their teeth _ they are setting the
wrong example for children.
	   About 17,000 mental-health professionals tackled problems
ranging from abusive coaches to gang rapes by athletes during a
symposium Tuesday night at the American Psychiatric Association's
annual meeting in Toronto.
	   Panelists acknowledged that violence has existed in sports
throughout history, but contended there is new cause for alarm
because children see so much of the misconduct depicted, and often
glorified, on television.
	   ``It seems every week something horrible is happening in the
world of athletics, something that goes over the line, and that our
kids see over and over again on TV,'' said Dr. Ronald Kamm, a
specialist in sports psychiatry who organized the symposium.
	   ``Television has made athletes larger than life,'' Kamm said.
``When kids see the violence in sports, they copy the behavior of
these role models.''
	   Incidents discussed at the workshop included Latrell Sprewell's
attack on his basketball coach and boxer Mike Tyson's ear-biting
outburst, but panelists have plenty of fresh ammunition for their
arguments.
	   They mentioned defending champion Gustavo Kuerten's
disqualification from the French Open this week for throwing his
tennis racket, and the May 19 baseball brawl between the New York
Yankees and Baltimore Orioles, provoked when pitcher Armando
Benitez drilled Tino Martinez in the back with a fastball.
	   Panelists suggested a range of remedies, including increased
emphasis on sportsmanship in youth leagues, alcohol bans at
stadiums to reduce fan misconduct, and tougher penalties for
athletes who engage in violence.
	   The down-to-earth hand-wringing about sports violence was
mingled with some highly technical terminology.
	   Dr. Antonia Baum, a psychiatrist from the University of
Rochester in the U.S. state of New York, spoke about ``intermittent
explosive disorder'' _ a seemingly apt description for much of the
behavior under discussion.
	   Kamm suggested that animal behavior studies could provide useful
insights into sports violence. For example, he said Benitez _ in
throwing at Martinez after surrendering a home run to Bernie
Williams _ was trying to reassert his territorial dominance.
	   Kamm said some research has suggested that certain athletes may
be genetically predisposed to violence. He cited one study linking
violent tendencies among hockey players to their testosterone
levels.
	   Dr. Robert Burton, a Northwestern University psychiatrist who
has served as consultant to the Chicago Bears football team,
discussed the problem of verbal abuse in sports. Screaming coaches,
jeering fans, trash-talking athletes _ all contribute to an
environment conducive to sports violence, he said.
	   ``Sports is such a big part of peoples lives, and there's no
organized group out there to oppose abuse,'' Burton said. ``As
psychiatrists, we can say it's just plain wrong.''
	   The panelists said psychiatry in underutilized by the sports
establishment, in large part because of resistance by coaches,
owners and parents. Baum said coaches and parents often do not want
to hear any suggestion that a young athlete may be suffering
emotional damage because of participation in a sport.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - President Leonid Kuchma said Wednesday he
would be prepared to entrust a leftist opposition leader with
forming Ukraine's new government.
	   If parliament elects Communist Party head Petro Symonenko or its
former Socialist speaker, Olexander Moroz, as a new speaker, ``We
should give them the opportunity, and I shall give it to them, to
form a government and take the responsibility in front of the
entire people.''
	   ``This would be a terrible experiment, but without this
experiment it would be impossible to dot all the i's,'' Kuchma said
in comments cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   It was not immediately clear, however, whether Kuchma indeed
planned to replace the government of Valery Pustovoitenko.
	   In further remarks, Kuchma also urged parliament to stop its
``dirty'' infighting and said it was vitally important not to allow
Ukraine to ``roll back'' to Soviet times.
	   Ukraine's new Verkhovna Rada parliament, elected in March,
repeatedly has failed to choose a new speaker. Several factions
including the pro-government one have refused to take part in the
vote, pushing for a ``package deal'' in which parliament would
elect all its leadership at once.
	   Constant political battles between the president and the largely
leftist legislature have blocked progress in Ukraine's economic
reforms.

At least 80 dead in high-speed German train crash other details from news conference

URGENT
Eds: UPDATES WITH locomotive apparently decoupling before accident,
With BC-Germany-High Speed Train

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 80 people and
seriously injuring 200 as car after car of the train crumpled into
the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear.
	   Klaus Rathert, a regional official, told a news conference that
the front locomotive apparently decoupled from the passenger cars,
causing them to derail and crash into the overpass.
	   The train's driver told officials he realized he'd lost the
passenger cars when the train jerked and a brake signal came on,
Rathert said.
	   The account conflicted with earlier reports suggesting that an
auto had plunged into the train from the overpass, causing the
derailment.
	   Police said an automobile was crushed beneath the wreckage, but
it was unclear where the car was parked at the time of the
accident. They said it was probably sitting along the tracks, not
on the overpass.
	   Police spokesman Joachim Lindenberg told ARD television that the
auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the tracks.
He said that anyone that close to the accident could not have
survived. Neither Rathert nor Deutsche Bahn immediately confirmed
that account.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the train had cleared the bridge, while
the cars derailed and jackknifed into each other and the overpass,
collapsing it.
	   At least 13 cars derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed the
cars meters (yards) high into the air.
	   The train was carrying at least 350 passengers.
	   Regional officials said 100 people were lightly injured, in
addition to the 200 serious injuries. They said they expected the
death toll to rise as rescue workers pulled apart the wreckage.
	   Survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the region. The Red
Cross chartered six buses to take most of the uninjured to Hamburg,
spokesman Harald Krueger said.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991.
	   A 1967 rail accident near Magdeburg in then-East Germany, killed
94 people in the deadliest rail accident since World War II. A
crossing barrier closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline,
causing it to explode and spreading fire into passenger cars.
	   The worst accident in western Germany was in 1971, when a train
carrying children on a field trip collided with a freight train,
killing 46 people.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Christian Krettek, of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN
that rescue workers expected the death toll to rise, and it was
still unclear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The train that crashed Wednesday was a first-generation ICE
model powered by two electric-powered locomotives pulling up to 14
passenger cars with a capacity of 759 passengers. At top speed the
train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to an emergency
stop.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

Brazil starts post-Romario era with easy 3-0 victory

<TEXT>
	   ST. OUEN, France (AP) _ Giovanni and Rivaldo scored a minute
apart in the first half and Brazil began its post-Romario era with
an easy 3-0 victory over Andorra on Wednesday in its last
international tune-up match before the World Cup.
	   Using Bebeto, who played the entire 90 minutes, in place of
Romario, Brazil easily overran the tiny Pyrenees nation, also
getting a goal from Cafu in the 53rd minute.
	   Giovanni gave Brazil the lead in the 26th minute and Rivaldo
scored a minute later to put the four-time and defending World Cup
champion in control.
	   The match marked the first time Brazil had played since
announcing Tuesday it was dropping Romario from its World Cup
roster due to an inflamed calf muscle. Emerson was named to the
roster in his place and Bebeto, Romario's striking partner from the
1994 World Cup title team, took his spot in the starting lineup.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted he
wasn't looking for handouts following a meeting Wednesday with
French President Jacques Chirac.
	   After arriving in Paris at the start of a two-day visit _ his
first overseas trip since becoming Prime Minister in April _
Kiriyenko twice told reporters an economic rescue package was not
on his agenda.
	   ``Neither on the official program nor outside the official
program is that (aid) a question,'' Kiriyenko said after his
meeting at the Elysee Palace with Chirac.
	   A small man in a blue suit who at times appeared lost among the
delegation of husky Russian businessmen and bodyguards who
accompanied him, Kiriyenko nevertheless projected confidence.
	   Russia's ongoing financial crisis has fueled speculation that
some kind of aid package from the world's leading industrialized
nation may be needed, primarily to prevent a collapse of the ruble.
	   Kiriyenko did say ``relations between G-7 countries and Russia
have reached a new stage.'' He didn't elaborate but said it is
vital for the European Union to open its markets to Russian goods.
	   Finance officials from the G-7 are to meet in Paris next week,
with the slump in the yen against the dollar and Russia's economic
troubles among the issues high on their agenda.
	   Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport, Kiriyenko
said Russia must further integrate into the world economy in order
to be able to better withstand financial shock waves like those
that have shaken Asia and Russia itself recently.
	   The Russian stock market has fallen about 50 percent from the
beginning of 1998, a dramatic change from the previous year's
record growth of 98 percent.
	   ``We should be more integrated in the industrial process and the
entire array of economic relations with other countries,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   In addition to Chirac, Kiriyenko was to meet with Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and leading French lawmakers and businessmen.
	   France is a modest trading partner, just eighth among Western
European nations, and Russia would like to increase ties with
aerospace, nuclear and automobile manufacturers.
	   However, France traditionally enjoys good political relations
with Russia and could be expected to support an eventual economic
aid package.

Stop condemning Soeharto: Belo, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): Bishop of Dili Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo joined
leading opposition figures Amien Rais and Megawati Soekarnoputri
yesterday in calling on the public to stop condemning former
president Soeharto.
	   ``I ask for respect for a man who has done the country a great
service,'' said Belo, who was critical of Soeharto's policies on
East Timor, as quoted by Antara in the East Timor capital of Dili.
	   Belo said it would be unethical for the country to go on
condemning its own former leader, pointing out that Soeharto would
not have stayed in power that long but for the support of those in
his political structure.
	   ``People should not put the blame on only Soeharto's
shoulders,'' Belo said. He then called for the removal of elements
of the former regime who were now prevailing in the new government
under Soeharto's protege, President B.J. Habibie.
	   Amien, the chairman of the 28-million-strong Muhammadiyah Moslem
organization, and Megawati, the ousted leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party, have both pleaded for compassion and for the
nation to stop hounding the fallen president.
	   Renegotiation
	   Rights campaigner Marzuki Darusman urged the government
yesterday, in order to end years of controversy, to allow the East
Timorese to decide on their own the status of the territory .
	   ``Take a real hard look at what they really want,'' said the
deputy chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights.
	   Marzuki said the government should renegotiate the political
relationship between Jakarta and East Timor by including the option
of a referendum, even as a last resort.
	   ``The government should try to sort out the human rights and all
outstanding immediate problems there,'' Marzuki said, adding that
such a stance might restimulate, on the part of the East Timorese,
an enthusiasm for becoming a part of Indonesia, as they showed when
they joined Indonesia in 1976.
	   ``Let's just give that a try,'' he said.
	   Marzuki also said that most members of the commission believed
``all political prisoners'', including East Timor separatist leader
Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, should be released eventually.
	   The government has said Xanana, who is serving 20 years in
prison for anti-Indonesia activities and illegal possession of
firearms, was not on its release list, despite mounting calls from
abroad.
	   But Marzuki appealed for time, saying the first important step
had been made with the government admitting that some of the people
they held were prisoners of conscience.
	   Since the fall of Soeharto on May 21, the government has
released four prominent political prisoners and dropped charges
against three women activists.
	   It has also pledged to release more political prisoners, but not
those involved in an abortive 1965 communist coup attempt, those
convicted of criminal charges or those who tried to replace the
state ideology.

	   I have killed housewife Rubina Akhter Ruby to avenge the insult
inflicted on my fiancee Sharifa, said Samad before the court of the
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) yesterday.
	   He made his confessional statement before the Metropolitan
Magistrate Abdus Salam Mian, who sent him to jail later on.
	   Earlier, the DB police produced him before the CMM court in the
noon yesterday after he had volunteered to make confessional
statement before the magistrate.
	   In his three and a-half-hours-statement, Samad, the domestic
help of the resident of the second floor of the victim's house,
said that he developed an affair with the victim's maid Sharifa
about one year ago. He also had sexual relationship with Sharifa
and proposed to her, he said.
	   This was noticed by Sharifa's employer Ruby and she sacked her
and sent Sharifa to her village home at Shahbazpur under Sarail
thana in Brahmanbaria district in April.
	   Since then Sharifa abetted him in killing Rubina by telling him
she would marry him only if he could kill Rubina, said Samad.
	   After the incident, Samad found two guards of the house Arif and
Emdadul Haque as his accomplices. He agreed to pay them Tk 20,000
for this purpose, he said.
	   On the day of the incident, he entered the apartment of Ruby by
the balcony and brought a 'boti' from the kitchen.
	   He opened the main door for Arif to enter the apartment, he
said, adding that, Arif took away sleeping Ruby's daughter Maisha
(2) to another room.
	   Then Samad tied Ruby's mouth with her scarf and took her to
bathroom where he hacked her indiscriminately until she died, he
stated.
	   Emdad was on duty on the ground floor during the time of the
incident.
	   Afterwards, he went to the second floor by the same way putting
the door locked from inside. Arif came down to the ground floor and
then they went to their respective places, he added.
	   Samad, Arif and Emdad were arrested by the DB police on the same
day (Friday) and they were remanded in police custody for seven
days. Police also arrested the maid Sharifa from her village home
on Saturday.
	   Sharifa and Arif made confessional statments before the same
magistrate on Sunday while Emdad did it on Monday.
	   All the accused made almost same statements before the
magistrate and they are now in jail.
	   Ruby (25), wife of Moyeenuddin Ahmed Ritu, was a level-2 student
of the Institute of Cost Management and Accountancy of Bangladesh.
Mother of only one child, a daughter, Ruby was found dead at her
Shantinagar residence on Friday.
	   Ruby's brother Jafar Imam filed a case with Motijheel thana in
this connection. The case is now being investigated by the DB
police.
	   She was laid to rest at Azimpur graveyard after the arrival of
her US-resident husband Ritu on Monday.
	   Her qulkhwani was held at her husband's residence after the Asr
prayer yesterday. A milad mahfil will be held on the ICMAB premises
after the Asr prayer today.

	   BANDUNG (JP): The prestigious Bandung Institute of Technology
(ITB) questioned criteria used by Hong Kong-based Asiaweek news
magazine to place it 14th on the a list of Asia's 30 best
institutes of science and technology.
	   ITB rector Liliek Hendrajaya and deputy rector for academic
affairs Widiatuyana separately said they were bewildered by the use
of lecturer's salaries as a ranking criteria.
	   ``It is true that lecturers would have to look for additional
income and side jobs if their salaries were low, but is their
assumption that high salaries lead to better productivity really
true?'' Widiatuyana asked.
	   The institute ranks 23rd in terms of the salaries which it pays
in the list published in Asiaweek's May 15 edition.
	   Widiatuyana said that unlike last year when the institute was
ranked 19th out of 50, this year's lists had been split between
universities and institutes of science and technology.
	   Widiatuyana said the change in method used to derive the
rankings made it appear that standards at the institute had
slipped, but he conceded that other criteria used, including
academic reputation and financial resources, had also contributed
to the fall in ranking.
	   ``Academic reputation was judged by asking other institutes how
well they knew ITB. This is ITBs weak point, because ITB cooperates
with many universities around the world, but not institutes,'' he
said.
	   Widiatuyana also conceded that lecturers from the institute had
published a limited number articles in international academic
journals.
	   Rector Liliek said he would guide ITB toward a better future
ranking.
	   ``We will strive to reach 10th place, or fifth place if
possible. We'll try the best we can for as long as I remain rector
here,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Australian government pledged here yesterday
to give Indonesia a A$12 million (US$8.4 million) grant to help
reduce the high maternal mortality rate and another A$2 million in
an assistance program to the National Commission on Human Rights.
	   Ambassador John McCarthy said the $12 million grant would be
spent in three provinces -- Irian Jaya, Maluku and West Java, and
that the fund would be administered by the United Nations
Children's Fund (Unicef) here.
	   It would be given over three years by the Australian Agency for
International Aid (AusAID).
	   The $2 million human rights assistance program would be spent to
help the commission train its staff in human rights principles and
law, management, good governance and English language.
	   One of the priorities of the assistance program will be the
establishment of a computerized complaints database and
standardized complaints handling procedures.
	   ``The project is the culmination of a lot of work and underlines
the fact that Australia is very supportive of the work of the
commission,'' McCarthy said.
	   It was the commission's organizational weaknesses as well as its
lack of appropriately trained staff that led the Australian
government to provide the assistance, he said.
	   The Memorandum of Understanding for the assistance was signed by
McCarthy and the rights commission's secretary-general, Baharuddin
Lopa, here yesterday.
	   McCarthy, also signed yesterday the memorandum for the $12
million grant with Unicef Indonesia Representative Stephen
Woodhouse and Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Haryono
Suyono.
	   The grant, the largest given to Indonesia after the World Bank
and Unicef for health programs that target mothers and children,
would be used by Unicef/AusAID to improve health care services to
women in poor villages in the three designated provinces.
	   According to Haryono, the selection of the three provinces to
receive the assistance was ``well-targeted'' because the percentage
of poor people in each province was high.
	   McCarthy said the aid was given to help protect the lives of
Indonesian women during pregnancy and in childbirth.
	   At present the country's national maternal mortality rate is 390
per 100,000 live births, one of the worst in Asia.

	   SIRAJGANJ, June 2: About nine lakh children of 16 northern
districts of the country are deprived of education as there is no

	   It is learnt that there are no primary schools in 822 villages
out of 2,045 villages in nine thanas under Sirajganj district, 660
villages out of 1,549 in nine thanas under Pabna, 875 villages out
of 1,400 in six thanas under Natore, 1,100 villages out of 1,915 in

and 421 villages out of 825 in five thanas under Panchagarh
districts.
	   However, with the introduction of Food for Education programme
the number of children without education has come down.Some
children of the villages without schools are reading in the schools
of the neighbouring villages only to collect foodgrains under the
programme. Different NGOs have also extended education facilities
to the remote village areas by introducing non-formal education
programmes. Yet about nine lakh children are still deprived of
primary education in the zone . Knowledgeable sources have opined
that primary schools should be set up in all the villages to ensure
education for all by 2000 as promised by the government.

Chief of staff postponed trip to India following nuclear tests 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from Indian ambassador to Israel
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's armed forces chief of staff postponed
a visit to New Delhi to avoid appearances that Israel is siding
with India against Pakistan, an Israeli official said Wednesday.
	   Tensions between traditional rivals India and Pakistan have
grown considerably since both carried out nuclear tests last month.
	   India was the first to conduct the tests, and Pakistan
reportedly suspected Israel of plotting to launch an air strike
against the Pakistani nuclear reactor with India's help to thwart
Pakistani tests. Israeli officials have dismissed the allegations
as baseless.
	   Israel has relations with India, but not with Pakistan, the
first Islamic nation to go nuclear.
	   Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the Israeli armed forces chief of staff,
had planned to visit India this week. However, after India carried
out its nuclear tests, the Indian government was informed that
Shahak would like to postpone the visit, said an Israeli official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Yediot Ahronot daily said
no new date for a Shahak visit has been set.
	   India's ambassador to Israel said the visit had been canceled
due to scheduling problems.
	   Israeli officials feared that a Shahak visit at this time would
encourage baseless speculation in the Islamic world that Israel and
India are cooperating on the development of nuclear weapons, Yediot
said. Israel is widely believed to be an undeclared nuclear power.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, declined comment on the Yediot Ahronot report.
	   India's ambassador Ranjan Mathay said that India had not
consulted Israel before carrying out its tests last month and
denied nuclear cooperation.
	   ``We have ongoing official level meetings with various
departments of government, the Israeli government and Indian
government,'' Mathay told Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   However, Israeli military analyst Reuven Pedatzur of the Galili
Center for Strategic and National Security confirmed Wednesday that
military ties between Israel and India have grown closer in the
past year. Pedatzur said the contacts are kept secret for the most
part.
	   U.S. media reported that a key scientist in India's nuclear
program, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, visited Israel several times in 1996
and 1997.
	   Foreign reports said Israel and India have set up projects in
several defense research areas, including guidance technology,
special materials and electronic warfare.
	   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday it would not discuss
military ties with other countries.
	   In 1996, Israel installed an air combat simulator at an Indian
training base for fighter pilots, India's first major defense
purchase from Israel.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): Human rights campaigner Marzuki Darusman cast
doubt yesterday on whether the attorney general's office could
fulfill its pledge to investigate alleged corrupt practices under
former president Soeharto.
	   ``I think the statement may have been made with good intentions
but it certainly lacks credibility because the workings of the
attorney general's office in the past reflected an incapacity to
address corruption cases,'' said Marzuki, who is deputy chairman of
the National Commission on Human Rights.
	   Marzuki said his skepticism stemmed from the fact that there
were a number of corruption cases in the past which remained
unsolved by the existing attorney general's office.
	   ``This casts doubt on their capabilities and professionalism to
tackle such sensitive issues,'' Marzuki told reporters after a
ceremony in which the commission received an Australian government
grant to upgrade its staff capabilities.
	   Marzuki therefore urged President B.J. Habibie to appoint an
independent special commission to probe alleged abuses during
Soeharto's 32 year rule.
	   ``It is a test of his leadership to appoint someone who is
credible. It is up to Habibie,'' he remarked.
	   Vengeance
	   While fully supporting the establishment of a commission to look
into Soeharto's alleged power abuses, Marzuki also urged the
government to act quickly in order to prevent the current mood from
deviating from a search for justice into full-blown vengeance
against Soeharto and his family.
	   ``The government needs to step in quickly and decisively to
avoid possible reprisals,'' Marzuki said.
	   He was also of the opinion that Soeharto and his family should
remain free until the commission is set up, because ``they have the
same rights as every other Indonesian''.
	   Once the commission was in place, some action could be taken to
ensure their ``availability to testify'', he said.
	   Opposition figure Amien Rais recently suggested that Soeharto
and his family be barred from traveling abroad, in case they
decided to flee to avoid issues pertaining to their wealth.
	   Marzuki said he deplored recent reports from several provinces
that students and other groups had taken drastic measures demanding
the removal of certain officials perceived as corrupt.
	   He feared that such moves could completely lose their sense of
justice and asserted that the presidential commission should also
handle such cases.
	   ``We are concerned that the prevailing sense of justice is
evolving into emotions for vengeance and reprisals. It is a very
unfortunate and unhealthy development which the whole country must
try to avoid,'' Marzuki said.
	   In addition to appointing an ``independent commission or
committee under the auspices of the government'', the government
should also urge the people to ``forgive'', Marzuki said.
	   ``But the truth still needs to be revealed if the public is
going to be asked to understand. To forgive and forget, they need
to know what they are being asked to forgive.''
	   Marzuki's comments followed a plea Monday by Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's first president Sukarno,
urging Indonesians to leave the 76-year-old Soeharto and his family
in peace.
	   Senior political scientist Miriam Budiardjo called for patience
since a probe into the possible abuses by Soeharto and his family
would need time before it could be completed.
	   ``The authorities must have evidence, and evidence is not always
easy to come by,'' Miriam, who is also a member of the rights
commission, told The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   ``There are a lot of stories circulating of course, but to get
evidence, that's going to be a problem,'' she added.
	   Separately, University of Indonesia criminologist Mulyana W.
Kusumah said that Habibie should now initiate a national
anticorruption campaign.
	   Mulyana said that under the Soeharto government, corruption,
collusion and nepotism were untouchable subjects.
	   ``Based on criminology, it is called an area of no
enforcement,'' Mulyana, who is also secretary-general of the
Independent Committee for Election Monitoring (KIPP), said.
	   Mulyana also said that authorities should immediately impose
travel bans on individuals suspected of corrupt practices before
they decided to flee the country.
	   ``We are racing against time,'' Mulyana said.

Dlrs 250 million pledged to support Rwanda's reforms 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Rwanda's efforts to restore social
stability through economic reforms were boosted Wednesday when
donor nations and international institutions pledged dlrs 250
million in support.
	   The funding for the small central African country where some
500,000 people died in ethnic slaughter in 1994 was negotiated at a
two-day meeting in the Swedish capital organized by the World Bank
and the Rwandan government.
	   Rwanda, which has an estimated dlrs 35 million gross domestic
product, is almost exclusively dependent on donors' aid, which
subsidizes half of its annual budget. Exports of tea and coffee,
mostly to Germany, are the main source of hard currency. Industry
employs only 3 percent of the working population.
	   The funds are not targeted for specific programs, said Nils
Tcheyan, the World Bank's country director for Rwanda. They are
intended to give Rwanda the capacity to follow through on a variety
of programs ranging from privatization to improving the health and
education systems.
	   Rwanda currently has debts of some dlrs 1.3 billion, Rwandan
Finance Minister Donald Kaberuka said at a news conference. At
least dlrs 34 million of the funds pledged on Wednesday is
earmarked to help Rwanda service that debt, Tcheyan said.
	   Kaberuka on Monday had appealed for more than dlrs 750 million
in support, but said the amount pledged on Wednesday was a
substantial step forward ``in the struggle for development and
national reconciliation.''
	   Most of the money is to be disbursed within the next 12 months,
Tcheyan said.
	   The meeting included representatives from Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United
States. Multilateral institutions at the talks included the African
Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in
Africa.

	   Work on nine kilometre gas pipeline along the Bangabandhu Jamuna
Multipur-pose Bridge has been completed recently. According to
reliable sources, about Taka 40 crore has been spent for setting up
the gas pipeline. The testing of the gas pipeline is going on
rapidly and is expected to be completed by June 7. But there is no
chance to install gas pipeline in Pabna district and Ishurdi
including the newly established Export Processing Zone (EPZ) at
Ishurdi in the first phase , it is gathered .
	   Pabna is considered to be the gateway to the country's northern
region. It is located at the central point of the country's rail,
road, water and air communication networks. Ishurdi is regarded as
one of the most important industrial, business and sugarcane
research centres in the country. Many big, medium and small
industrial units are situated here .
	   According to local businessmen , gas is urgently needed here in
the face of shortage of electricity for smooth operation of the
industrial units in the district. On the other hand, a huge amount
of money is required everyday to purchase furnace oil for the North
Bengal Paper Mills at Paksey. Gas may be used as a substitute for
the furnance oil and electricity through which crores of Taka can
be saved. The local businessmen have urged the authority concerned
to set up gas pipeline from Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge to Pabna.140
telephone lines disconnected
	   Some 140 telephone lines of the district have been disconnected
in a recent drive due to non-payment of arrear bills worth about
Tk. 12 lakh. Official sources said , telephone lines of
businessmen, doctors, public houses and other emergency phones have
been snapped for non-payment of arrear bills. It is alleged that
some private lines without paying huge amount of arrear bills are
still in operation due to some underhand dealing in connivance with
some corrupt employees of the telephone department.

Rice procurement may hit 20-year low, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): The State Logistics Agency (Bulog) estimated
yesterday that its domestic rice procurement may fall to 250,000
metric tons this year, the lowest level in 20 years, due to a
decline in rice production.
	   Bulog chairman Beddu Amang, however, said that the agency would
be able to meet the domestic demand with imports estimated to reach
three million tons this year.
	   He said Bulog would import 3.1 million tons of rice if its
procurement reached only 250,000 tons. ``But if the agency could
purchase 500,000 tons from local farmers, imports would be cut to
around 2.85 million tons,'' he told reporters after a hearing with
the House of Representatives' Commission III for agriculture,
forestry and plantations, transmigration and food affairs.
	   Bulog said its rice procurement in the January-to-May period
plunged 94 percent to 96,512 tons from 1.55 million tons in the
same period last year.
	   ``This year's procurement will likely reach only 250,000 tons.
It is the lowest level in 20 years,'' Beddu said, adding that
domestic procurement reached 1.95 million tons last year and 1.43
million tons in 1996.
	   He said Bulog initially planned to buy about one million tons
locallythis year but the decline in production caused by the
drought made it impossible to meet the procurement target.
	   Bulog's rice stocks on May 28 stood at 2.5 million tons, sugar
at 592,686 tons, wheat flour at 325,000 tons and soybeans at
102,596 tons.
	   He said the rice stocks were sufficient for three months while
those for sugar and other commodities could last up to 28 months.
	   Beddu, however, ruled out a possible rice shortage in the coming
months.
	   ``Don't worry, our stocks will increase because our rice imports
continue to flow in from Thailand, China and Vietnam and we are
still receiving rice aid from other countries.''
	   He added that Japan has pledged to supply 500,000 tons of rice
in soft loans with a 30-year maturity and 100,000 tons as a grant,
Taiwan would sell 200,000 tons, China 250,000 tons and Vietnam
10,000 tons and Thailand would give 5,000 tons in a grant.
	   The government is still negotiating for another 400,000-ton rice
grant from Japan and 100,000 tons from Taiwan, Beddu said.
	   Recent reports have said Thai rice and sugar exporters have
stopped accepting Indonesia's letters of credit (L/Cs) for rice and
sugar orders due to the uncertain conditions here.
	   But Beddu said that Thai exporters had agreed to take
Indonesia's L/Cs if they were opened by state banks and endorsed by
foreign banks in Singapore.
	   Beddu also said yesterday that Bulog planned to invite local and
international tenders to buy commodities for the agency.
	   ``We will no longer go to the international market quietly. We
will invite foreign suppliers through international tenders if
necessary. This will apply to any commodities,'' Beddu said.
	   Beddu added that the subsidies on basic commodities would remain
until the economic situation improved to help remedy the pains of
the common people.
	   ``The International Monetary Fund has agreed on the subsidies
which will amount to Rp 5.3 trillion (US$460 million) to import
basic commodities. The IMF has asked us to gradually remove the
subsidies but this depends on the economic conditions,'' he said.
	   The government's agreement with the IMF stipulates that
subsidies on all commodities, except rice, must be abolished by
Oct. 1.
	   ``But if we are not able to scrap the subsidies, then we don't
have to. We understand that the subsidies will burden our state
budget, but on the other hand we have to help our people,'' Beddu
said.

Dlrs 250 million pledged to support Rwanda's reforms 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Leads with three grafs to ADD background on Rwandan economy
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Rwanda's efforts to restore social
stability through economic reforms were boosted Wednesday when
donor nations and international institutions pledged dlrs 250
million in support.
	   The funding for the small central African country where some
500,000 people died in ethnic slaughter in 1994 was negotiated at a
two-day meeting in the Swedish capital organized by the World Bank
and the Rwandan government.
	   Rwanda, which has an estimated dlrs 35 million gross domestic
product, is almost exclusively dependent on donors' aid, which
subsidizes half of its annual budget. Exports of tea and coffee,
mostly to Germany, are the main source of hard currency. Industry
employs only 3 percent of the working population.
	   The funds are not targeted for specific programs, said Nils
Tcheyan, the World Bank's country director for Rwanda. They are
intended to give Rwanda the capacity to follow through on a variety
of programs ranging from privatization to improving the health and
education systems.
	   Rwanda currently has debts of some dlrs 1.3 billion, Rwandan
Finance Minister Donald Kaberuka said at a news conference. At
least dlrs 34 million of the funds pledged on Wednesday is
earmarked to help Rwanda service that debt, Tcheyan said.
	   Kaberuka on Monday had appealed for more than dlrs 750 million
in support, but said the amount pledged on Wednesday was a
substantial step forward ``in the struggle for development and
national reconciliation.''
	   Most of the money is to be disbursed within the next 12 months,
Tcheyan said.
	   The meeting included representatives from Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United
States. Multilateral institutions at the talks included the African
Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in
Africa.

Israel: Mastermind of Achille Lauro hijacking no security threat 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former PLO guerrilla chief who mastermined
the 1985 murder of an American Jew during the Achille Lauro cruise
ship hijacking does not pose a threat to Israeli security, the
attorney general ruled Wednesday.
	   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein wrote that Israel doesn't
plan to seek the arrest of Mohammed Abbas, who is currently
visiting in the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.
	   Rubinstein responded to a petition by two Israelis and Dov
Hikind, a New York State Assemblyman from Brooklyn, who have asked
the Supreme Court to order the Israel to arrest and try Abbas for
murder. The court has not said when it would issue a decision.
	   In a statement to the court, Rubinstein said Abbas ``does not
pose a security threat'' and that an arrest ``would probably cause
real friction with the Palestinian side.''
	   Guerrillas acting on Abbas' orders seized the Italian cruise
ship off Egypt in 1985. They shot an elderly American passenger in
a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, and threw his body overboard.
	   The hijackers surrendered to Egyptian authorities, who put Abbas
and his men on a flight for Tunisia, where the PLO was
headquartered at the time. But the U.S. Navy forced the flight down
in Ital,y and the Italian authorities allowed Abbas to flee.
	   An Italian court later convicted Abbas and two other PLO
guerrillas in absentia and sentenced them to life in prison.
	   In 1996, Israel allowed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, to
return to the Gaza Strip to attend a session of the Palestine
National Council. Since then he has returned to Gaza three times
and has described the current stay as an extended one.
	   '' We had always said that what took place on the ship had not
been planned and had not been organized and I wasn't on the ship,''
Abbas told The Associated Press from Gaza.
	   Under a 1993 peace agreement with the Palestinians, Israel
allowed thousands of PLO guerrillas to return from abroad and enter
the new autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   Rubinstein wrote that ``it would not be reasonable to prosecute
(Abbas) for acts which he committed before Sept. 13 1993.''

Emergency fund for Siberian tiger makes first move 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ A new fund to help the endangered
Siberian tiger is moving to aid fire-fighting efforts at two nature
reserves in eastern Russia, the World Wildlife Fund said Wednesday.
	   An allocation of some dlrs 20,000 is intended to buy and repair
fire-fighting vehicles and other equipment in the Lazovsky and
Sikhote-Alin reserves, home to the most of the surviving 425 to 475
wild Siberian tigers.
	   Unusually dry weather conditions in the area, near the Sea of
Japan, have led to forest fires which ``have already destroyed over
2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of prime tiger land,'' the WWF said in
a statement.
	   Dry weather is set to continue through the summer, with a high
risk of more fires, it added.
	   ``It is better to move now when the situation has not reached
gargantuan proportions than to wait and witness a serious
environmental catastrophe,'' said Jean-Pierre d'Huart, manager of
WWF's International Species Unit.
	   The Tiger Emergency Fund was set up in January by the WWF and
the World Conservation Union.
	   It is intended as a ``rapid-response mechanism'' for dealing
with any events increasing the threats to the tigers' survival.

	   JAKARTA (JP): To raise the question of the legitimacy of
Habibie's presidency is not mere political wrangling. By contrast,
however, constitutional debate on the legality of the transfer of
power to Habibie is an irrelevant and worthless exercise.
	   The circumstances that led to Soeharto's resignation are not
provided for in the constitution, or in any other existing
legislation.
	   To the very end, Soeharto never once expressed a readiness or
desire to step down. He once said that as a soldier he would never
``shirk his responsibility'', whatever that meant, but in the end
he was forced by circumstances to do so. He finally had no choice
but to bow to the continuous pressure of student demonstrations
which gave voice to the desires of the masses.
	   Although there are provisions in the constitution and existing
legislation designed to cover the event of the president resigning
or becoming incapacitated, the circumstances which they postulate
bear no resemblance to the events which unfolded last month. The
existing laws and procedures largely cover death in office, not
voluntary resignation.
	   A provision in the constitution does however state that in the
event of the president's resignation, he or she shall be replaced
by the vice president.
	   Unfortunately, how the transfer of power should take place is
not explained and it is left open to debate whether a simple
transfer ceremony is sufficient, or if a special session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is actually required to
reissue the presidential mandate.
	   At the heart of the matter is the fact that the President did
not resign of his own accord or will, but was in effect forced out
by the people.
	   This makes the problem relating to his resignation political in
nature, and not a legal conundrum. Furthermore, it is a political
problem in an emergency situation and the need for a swift solution
is therefore of paramount importance.
	   Here we run onto the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, we
have demanded total and comprehensive reform of the political
system and forced drastic change in the national leadership through
somewhat ``revolutionary'' means, while at the same time calling
for greater democracy. A dangerous vicious circle beckons,
promising ever greater repetitions of the events of the last few
months.
	   To avoid this, emergency political steps must be taken. The
nationwide demand for a special session of the MPR and a fair and
free election in the shortest time possible is an expression of
democratic aspirations and a determination to adhere to the
principles of the 1945 Constitution.
	   However, to ensure that the MPR is representative of society at
large, a shake up in the present membership is required. Some
members have already resigned while more must surely follow because
of the nepotistic nature of their appointments. Of no lesser
significance is the fact that Golkar, the largest and ruling
political organization, appears to be disintegrating. The arguments
for rejuvenating the MPR membership are therefore very powerful.
	   There is good reason to doubt if we have either the time or the
money to hold an immediate election, because the economic crisis
has rapidly gone from bad to worse. But a fair and free election is
an internationally accepted and democratic means of solving a
political crisis of this nature.
	   Announcing and executing definite plans to hold an election
would go a long way to restoring confidence, both at home and
abroad.
	   Above all, however, a simple announcement by President Habibie
or the MPR stating that the current presidency is provisional or
transitional in nature is absolutely necessary to reassure our
citizens and the international community of the current
government's good intentions.
	   The choice of vice president was a calculated political maneuver
on the part of Soeharto, as was the selection of MPR members and
those who sit on other representative bodies. His presidency was
the lynchpin in the system which the nation is now demanding be
totally reformed.
	   What is so difficult about making such a simple but decisive
statement, if President Habibie honestly has no ulterior motive?
More than anything else, honesty and humility breed trust and
confidence.
	   An honest and humble admission on the part of the present
government would go along way to ensuring that the present crisis
will shortly be consigned to history, and this despite the new
government having in its ranks a number of political turncoats not
entirely free from suspicion of corruption.
	   We also badly need the confidence of the international
community. An emergency rescue operation lead by the international
community is perhaps the only way to save the country from
collapse. Will our new leaders be honest, modest, and humble enough
to admit this sobering fact and swallow their often misplaced
national pride?

Golkar further split as senior members call on Harmoko to go, JAKARTA POST

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (JP): A group of senior Golkar members demanded the
resignation of the ruling group's chairman Harmoko because his
alleged deception of the public and former president Soeharto
contributed toward the current political turmoil.
	   The group also petitioned for an early congress to elect a new
chairman. The Golkar congress is currently scheduled for October.
	   Iskandar Mandji, a member of the group which go by the name of
the Team of Golkar's Saviors, told The Jakarta Post that Harmoko
had ``lied'' when he told former president Soeharto that the public
wanted him to run for a seventh consecutive term as president
earlier this year.
	   Soeharto's reelection in March was greeted by massive
demonstrations across the country. Political tension then rose,
leading eventually to last months massive outburst of anger,
rioting and looting which forced Soeharto to resign.
	   In his response, Harmoko said that only a congress could dismiss
a chairman. He said all members had to comply with the
organization's statutes, which state that a congress is the correct
forum to elect and dismiss a chairman.
	   Golkar has a collective leadership whose term in office is
determined through a consensual agreement between members, he
added.
	   ``We'll call a meeting with the leaders of Golkar's regional
chapters to listen to members' opinions and discuss what steps we
can take,'' he said.
	   Critical
	   Iskandar said Golkar was now facing a critical time given that
political reform was proceeding quickly and new political parties
were being established.
	   ``Golkar is still a valid medium through which to campaign for
democracy. We want Golkar to survive the transition and continue to
exist as a political force,'' he said.
	   The group calling for Harmoko's resignation consists of founding
members Sudarko Prawirojudo and Bambang Warrih Koesoema, and senior
Golkar members Farid Akhwan, Syaiful M.D. and Tadjoeddin Noer Said.
	   Iskandar said Golkar had been under intense scrutiny because its
legislators were considered to be hand-picked Soeharto ``yes-men'',
especially during the general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) which reelected Soeharto in March.
	   ``As the whole nation can now see, (Harmoko's claim that a
majority of people still wanted Soeharto at the nation's helm) was
wrong because there have been strong and continuous demands for
Soeharto to step down since he was reelected,'' he said.
	   Iskandar said the process of recruiting Golkar members for the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)/House of Representatives (DPR)
was known to be a viper's nest of collusion and nepotism. Many
Golkar legislators in the House are relatives of senior figures in
the political establishment.
	   He also said the decision to request an immediate congress was
taken after the group learned of the intentions of one of Golkar's
strongest allies to break ranks and declare itself an independent
political party.
	   The Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR) announced that
it would separate from Golkar and establish itself as an
independent political party last week.
	   Kosgoro, another ally, hinted that it too was considering a
similar move, compounding the severe pressure Golkar is currently
under.
	   Meanwhile, Tadjoeddin said those concerned should await
completion of the new law on political parties before responding to
the new opportunities which have presented themselves.
	   ``We have to wait for the new law to be completed before we can
respond to recent developments,'' he told the Post.
	   He also said people must decide for themselves whether or not
they still want to maintain an ambiguous system with two political
parties (the United Development Party and Indonesian Democratic
Party), and Golkar, which claims not to be a political party but
nevertheless contests general elections.

OAU names former presidents, judges to Rwanda inquiry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The Organization of African
Unity on Wednesday appointed a seven-member panel to investigate
the role of foreign powers and individuals in the 1994 Rwandan
genocide.
	   OAU Secretary General Salim Salim of Tanzania said the
investigation team would also examine measures to prevent a
re-occurrence of the massacres which resulted in about 500,000
deaths, mainly of ethnic Rwandan Tutsis.
	   Tutsi rebels based mainly in Uganda won power in Rwanda in July
1994 and ended the killings, which occurred several months after a
U.N. peacekeeping officer warned his superiors in a fax of the
danger of massacres planned by Hutu extremists.
	   OAU officials did not immediately provide details about the
terms of the new investigation.
	   Also appointed to the panel are former Mali president Gen.
Toumani Toure; Algeria's ex-chairman of the International Court of
Justice Mohamed Bedjaou; former U.N. official and Liberian
presidential candidate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf; one-time U.N.
Development Program chief Lisbet Palme of Sweden; former Indian
Supreme Court chairman H. Bagwati and UNICEF deputy chief Stephen
Lewis of Canada.
	   The investigation team was first suggested by Ethiopian Prime
Minister Ato Meles Zewani in November 1997.
	   A U.N. tribunal on Rwanda has indicted 35 people with genocide
crimes.
	   Rwanda, frustrated by the slow pace of the U.N. tribunal, has
started its own trials of 125,000 suspects. So far, 144 of 337
convicted have received death sentences.

No oil production cuts in Kazakstan despite lower prices 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan does not plan to cut oil production,
despite the fall in world oil prices, the president of the
Kazakhoil national oil company said Wednesday.
	   Nurlan Kapparov told the Interfax news agency in Kazakstan that
it would not be profitable to close wells, because reopening them
would entail huge expenses.
	   ``Even if a well is not unprofitable, it would be better left in
production,'' he said.
	   Kapparov said the government considered reducing excise duties
or taking other measures to help oil companies, but ``budget
possibilities are limited'' in the Central Asian country.
	   Kazakstan expects to extract 26 million to 36 million metric
tons (7.35 billion to 7.64 billion gallons) of oil this year,
Kapparov said.
	   Kapparov also said that the Tengizchevroil joint venture _ in
which Chevron has a 45-percent stake and Mobil 25 percent _ plans
to increase oil production this year.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Wednesday offered to hold
bilateral talks with rival neighbor Pakistan in a meeting with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, however, rejected the
possibility of a third party in the mediation between the two
hostile neighbors. India and Pakistan, which have fought three
wars, last month conducted nearly a dozen nuclear tests that has
set off an arms race in the region.
	   There has been speculation that Western leaders meeting Thursday
in Geneva to discuss how to defuse nuclear tension between India
and Pakistan would take up the disputed region of Kashmir as the
root of their rivalry.
	   Emerging from the meeting with Vajpayee, Kharrazi urged India
and Pakistan to talk to reduce tensions after earlier praising
Pakistan's ``Islamic bomb.''
	   ``We believe in a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region,'' he
said.
	   Kharrazi is the first foreign dignitary to visit the region
after India conducted five tests May 11-13 and Pakistan responded
two weeks later with what it said were six tests. He flew into New
Delhi on Tuesday night from Islamabad.
	   Vajpayee said India is willing to take part in the negotiations
on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty at a Geneva disarmament
conference.
	   India already has announced a moratorium on further nuclear
testing and agreed to discuss a no-first use agreement with either
Pakistan or with other nuclear weapons states, he said.
	   ``These issues cannot be placed in an exhaustive South Asian
context,'' Vajpayee said. ``There are other issues which relate to
India-Pakistan relations. These issues, which include confidence
building measures, can only be addressed bilaterally.''
	   A top Indian foreign ministry official said India found
international concerns about the situation in South Asia were
exaggerated.
	   ``Life is normal. There is no ground for exaggeration and
dramatizing the situation,'' said Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath.
	   Japan's fears over how a nuclear arms race in South Asia could
affect global disarmament efforts prompted it to propose an
international nonproliferation forum _ possibly to be held in
Hiroshima, a city devastated by an American atomic bomb at the end
of World War II.
	   A formal announcement of the proposal will be made Thursday,
according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   Iran, Kharrazi said, has been very concerned about developments
in South Asia following the nuclear tests. But he welcomed the
Pakistani tests.
	   ``The development of a nuclear bomb by a Muslim country can act
as a deterrent for Israel,'' said Kharrazi.
	   Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear power. Iran has
repeatedly denied U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is close to
building a nuclear weapon.
	   In another development, Indian army chief Gen. V.P. Malik has
called off a visit to London following Britain's role in
formulating the European Union's condemnation of its nuclear tests,
United News of India news agency reported.
	   It quoted unnamed defense officials as saying Malik called off
his visit last month, days before naval chief Vishnu Bhagawat also
canceled his trip to Britain.

	   CRETEIL, France (AP) _ Mexico and Saudi Arabia played to a
scoreless draw Wednesday in a World Cup warmup that showed little
flair by either side.
	   Mexico controlled the ball longer but the Saudis created more
scoring chances. The evening match was watched by 5,000 spectators
in this Parisian suburb.
	   Saudi Arabia came close to scoring in the first minute when
Khalid al Muwalid shot wide from one meter. In the 22nd, Sammy al
Jaber couldn't head a ball from a good position, with Mexican
goalkeeper Osvaldo Perez beaten.
	   The Saudis face Denmark in their World Cup opener June 12 in
Lens. Mexico opens against Korea on June 13 in Lyon.

Russian exchange seeks to expand business, link with Chicago trade board 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Moscow Stock Exchange is hoping to snap up the
business of an ailing rival and start cooperation with the Chicago
Board of Trade, exchange president Victor Sakharov said Wednesday.
	   That might be a boon for Russia's shaky futures market, which
suffered a setback earlier this week when one futures exchange, The
Russian Bourse, collapsed.
	   Sakharov wants to bring in Russian Bourse traders and their
business and tie up with the Chicago Board of Trade, although the
plans are still preliminary.
	   The Moscow Stock Exchange currently doesn't offer futures.
	   A Russian Bourse spokeswoman said the exchange is trying to
figure out what led to its collapse and what to do next.
	   Market participants said the exchange couldn't meet margin calls
earlier this week, amid a roughly 50 percent drop in the market
since the beginning of the year.
	   About dlrs 18 million was lost in the collapse, Russian Bourse
officials said. The exchange's daily volume was around dlrs 120
million, they said.
	   Futures allow investors to purchase a contract on an underlying
asset for future delivery.
	   But the instruments are little used in Moscow and St. Petersburg
trading, mostly because their exchanges are unsophisticated and the
regulatory structure almost nonexistent.

	   Many Chinese Indonesians can tell stories of how their assets
were destroyed or in some cases their safety targeted by the mobs
in the recent riots that hit Jakarta and several other cities in
Indonesia.
	   So, I found Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo's letter criticizing Chinese
Indonesians that fled the country during the rioting to be unfair.
After all, nobody knew at the time that the transfer of power was
going to take place peacefully.
	   On the other hand, I would support the calls by others for
Chinese Indonesians to put more effort into assimilating with
indigenous people. I also call on the authorities to take more
concrete steps to address the issue. Furthermore it is important to
improve national security because if people do not feel safe they
will not return to do their business as usual.
	   There have been accounts of loss of lives, assets and jobs due
to the riots. However, few have mentioned the long-term impact of
the loss of confidence and higher risk perceived by people. This
will result in more capital and even skilled people leaving and
fewer coming to Indonesia at a time when the country badly needs
the expertise and capital.
	   Even when things stabilize further, investors in general will be
less inclined to put their money into businesses which are
long-term in nature. This will significantly handicap Indonesia in
its bid to be a competitive economy in the 21st century. The stakes
are just too big for the issue to be ignored.

Samaranch tells U.S.: win medals in 2002 to ensure Salt Lake success AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ A large medal haul by U.S. athletes is
necessary to ensure the success of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt
Lake City, the head of the International Olympic Committee said
Wednesday.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said American athletes need
to improve on their performance from this year's Nagano Olympics,
where they won 13 medals, in order to boost public enthusiasm for
the games in the host country.
	   Samaranch delivered his message during a meeting with U.S.
Olympic Committee president William Hybl and Salt Lake City
organizers.
	   ``Concern was expressed by the president about the performance
of the U.S. team in 2002,'' said Frank Joklik, president of the
Salt Lake organizing committee. ``He feels the home team doing well
is an essential element of a successful Olympic Games. He is very
anxious to see a performance of a U.S.A. team that will be an
advance on what was achieved in Nagano.''
	   Samaranch noted that the success of the home team had played a
big part in generating excitement at the 1992 Barcelona Games, the
1994 Lillehammer Games and the 1998 Nagano Games.
	   Hybl reported to the IOC executive board on the work of the
USOC's ``athlete's performance group,'' a panel set up 10 months
ago to improve America's medal chances at the 2000 Sydney Olympics
and the Salt Lake City Games.
	   The 13 medals from Nagano, including six gold, matched the
United States' best ever performace at a winter games. But the
total was still below expectations.
	   Hybl said the Americans will definitely do better in 2002.
	   ``Based on what we know now, the USOC and myself are convinced
we will exceed the 13 medals we won in Nagano by some magin,'' he
said.
	   On another issue, Salt Lake officials confirmed their Olympic
mascot won't be ready before early 1999, a year later than
originally planned, but said there was no reason to panic.
	   ``I don't think it's a hangup at all,'' Joklik said. ``It's one
of the issues that everyone wants a little input on. If we come up
with something early next year, we'll be in good shape.''
	   Joklik said Salt Lake was determined to avoid the experience of
Atlanta's much-maligned mascot. First called ``Whatizit,'' the
computer-generated blue mascot was presented to the world at the
closing ceremony in Barcelona in 1992 and was widely ridiculed as a
blob, slug, maggot and worse.
	   Stung by the response, Atlanta organizers redesigned the mascot
into a more child-friendly creature with a new name, ``Izzy.''
While popular with kids, the mascot continued to be the butt of
jokes and criticism in the world's media.
	   ``Definitely, we don't want to do that,'' Joklik said. ``I hope
we come up with a better name than `Whatizit.' And we hope it will
be very plain what (the mascot) is.'''
	   On the sports program for 2002, SLOC vice president Dave Johnson
said discussions were continuing on the possible inclusion of
women's bobsledding. But he said there now appeared little chance
of adding women's ski jumping and indicated that skeleton _ a
head-first version of luge _ may not be included as previously
expected.
	   On Tuesday, the IOC approved the addition of men's and women's
pursuit events in biathlon and increased the number of women's ice
hockey teams from six to eight.
	   The changes mean there are now 70 medal events in seven sports
for 2002. As of now, Salt Lake City is planning to receive 2,365
athletes and accomodate 3,547 competitors and officials in the
Olympic village.
	   Joklik told the IOC that Salt Lake had recently hired a senior
vice president for human resources, Ed Eynon, and a director of
alpine sports, Herwig Demschar.
	   But Salt Lake still has no sports director, a key role the IOC
has repeatedly pressed organizers to fill.
	   ``We continue the search and are hopeful of filling the position
in the next few weeks,'' Joklik said.
	   Meanwhile, IOC officials expressed concern at high ticket prices
proposed for the Sydney Olympics.
	   While no figures were released, news reports in Australia have
suggested that organizers are proposing prices as high as dlrs
1,000 for premium seats at the opening ceremony. The most expensive
tickets for Atlanta's opening ceremony cost dlrs 650.
	   The IOC set up a four-man working group to study Sydney's ticket
proposals. The package is expected to be finalized before the next
Olympic meetings in Seoul, South Korea, in September.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Morocco's delegates to the
Organization of African Unity failed to appear at preliminary
meetings this week and may boycott next week's summit, an OAU
official said Wednesday.
	   Delegates attending the pan-African OAU preparatory meetings
this week in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, discussed the
summit agenda, which may include a debate on membership for Western
Sahara.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official from the OAU
secretariat said Morocco, which has boycotted the OAU since 1984
when Western Sahara was admitted as an independent member, is not
expected to attended the summit meetings.
	   However, a number of African countries _ including summit hosts
Burkina Faso _ propose suspending Western Sahara's OAU membership
until the results of an independence referendum there later this
year, officials said.
	   Many member states of the OAU have individually dropped their
recognition of Western Sahara although OAU Secretary General Salim
Salim said his organization continued to recognize it as
independent state.
	   The issue could be decided in a vote by OAU members on the final
day of the summit next Wednesday.
	   Morocco has administered Western Sahara since 1976 when the
territory as abandoned by its colonial ruler Spain. Morocco is
trying to quash an independence movement in Western Sahara and has
boycotted past OAU functions in protest over discussions on the
territory's sovereignty.
	   Moroccan flags flying next to those of other OAU member states
have been removed from Ouagadougou's streets, indicating their
delegates will not attend the summit meetings.
	   U.N. observers have been deployed in the region since 1991 to
oversee a cease-fire between Moroccan forces and Western Saharan
rebels.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The death of four Trisakti University students
last May 12 motivated students to escalate their campaign for total
reform. In the same way as Arief Rachman Hakim, a University of
Indonesia student who was shot to death by the military in 1966,
the four became martyrs and heroes for political reform.
	   In the two days after the shooting, there were massive riots in
Jakarta and its surrounding satellite towns of Bekasi and
Tangerang.
	   These were the worst riots in Indonesia's modern political
history. Rumors making the rounds were plenty. One said the riots
were the work of some military officers who wanted to imitate what
their predecessors did during the Malari Affair in 1974, when they
ordered hoodlums to loot and burn shopping centers in Senen,
Central Jakarta.
	   Their intention was to deceive the public into believing that
the riots were committed by students; thus, the public would
condemn students and would not support their demonstration for
total reform. The politics of scapegoating the students was
unsuccessful.
	   Another rumor said they were organized by the military as an
excuse for their chief commander, Gen. Wiranto, to stop student
demonstrations.
	   Others speculated the riots were part of a power struggle among
the military elite.
	   Another story had it they were organized to demolish symbols of
development of Soeharto's regime.
	   The deaths of the students and the riots did not quash the
students' determination to topple Soeharto as a precondition for
total reform.
	   For the second time in Indonesia's young history, a student
movement succeeded in forcing the president out of office. This
time it was the most powerful man in Indonesia who had ruled with
an iron fist for 32 years.
	   Several factors forced Soeharto to make the decision:
	   The occupation of the House building by thousands of students.
They were willing to sacrifice their lives rather than leave the
building without Soeharto's resignation. The Armed Forces (ABRI)
accommodative attitude toward students during their demonstrations
boosted their spirit to topple Soeharto.
	   Soeharto failed to reshuffle his Cabinet in time, and 14 of his
ministers resigned.
	   It seems probable Gen. Wiranto told Soeharto that ABRI could not
support him any more.
	   There may have also been several external factors which
contributed to expedite Soeharto's downfall, such as the delay in
disbursement of International Monetary Fund's bailout contribution
for Indonesia and the indirect support for student movements in the
country.
	   In a way, these May student demonstrations in Indonesia can be
regarded as a middle class revolution. Compared to previous student
movements, this year's student movements were supported by almost
all sections of society, particularly the middle class. Their
support came in the form of money, food, printing materials,
T-shirts, encouraging public opinion, organizing short courses to
enhance students' critical ability, musical entertainment and
others.
	   The middle class' help for the students can be divided into five
categories:
	   First, those who had genuine motives for political and economic
reforms or the true believers. They spent a lot of money to assist
student demonstrations, without any political or economic interests
except total reforms.
	   Second, former student activists who had tried to topple
Soeharto's regime for more than 24 years and who were eager to end
the dictatorship in Indonesia.
	   Third, those who were unhappy with the Soeharto's family
business activities since the beginning of the economic crisis in
July 1997, either because they lost their jobs or they could not
compete with crony capitalists who were close to Soeharto's family.
	   Fourth, the newcomers or ``free riders'' who jumped on the
bandwagon just before Soeharto's downfall.
	   Fifth, former Soeharto's cronies and aides who wanted to ``wash
their hands'' to show to the people that they were clean and eager
to dissociate themselves from corruption, nepotism and collusion.
Students call this group ``last-minutes heroes'' or ``eleventh hour
heroes''.
	   Although Soeharto has lost his power, students and civilian
political elites still continue their demands for total reform.
Many have never accepted Habibie as Soeharto's successor, because
Habibie was very close to Soeharto and he is still considered part
of the problem, a leader whose managerial capability to handle the
present political and economic crisis still needs to be tested.
	   Some legal experts believe the transfer of power from Soeharto
to Habibie was illegal or unconstitutional. In other words, the
nation shows increasing signs of polarization over Habibie
presidency and his cabinet. Students are also divided between those
who support Habibie and those who still oppose him.
	   The aftermath of Soeharto's resignation can be regarded as a
period of struggle for powers among political elites, without
considering social and economic conditions.
	   Today, many former Soeharto cronies are forming new political
parties as if, in this new era of political reform, people are free
enough to do that without any consideration that their actions will
endanger the nation's unity and stability.
	   It seems their understanding of the liberal democratic system
was very limited. Unless statesmanship grows at the heart of
Indonesia's political elite, this country will inadvertently be
torn to pieces.
	   The present situation also sees a psychological war between
military and civilian elites. While the civilian political elite is
still screaming about total reform without any agreement on the
future reform agenda, the military are preparing drafts of
political development after Soeharto.
	   The military elite is also trying to show to the people that
they are humble and accommodative toward the civilian elite who
demand total reform.
	   Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah's handling of the problem
of the free press in Indonesia is an example of how ABRI approaches
journalists.
	   In addition, ABRI Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs, Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono, showed the accommodative approach in dealing
with the people and political elite.
	   The elite can still discuss political reform in cafes and
hotels. The elite can also afford to think about ``what menus will
we pick to eat from today?'', while the common people who live from
one day to another ponder ``what will we eat today?''.
	   Unless the civilian elite take the people's stomachs into
consideration, it is possible the grassroots groups will shift
their allegiance from the civilian to the military elite in the
next six months or so.
	   Although it is hard to believe at present, it is not impossible
that the military will dominate the government because the civilian
political elite cannot cope with the present economic and political
crisis.
	   The writer is a researcher at the Center for Political and
Regional Studies, Indonesian Institute of Sciences.
	   Window: In a way, these May student demonstrations in Indonesia
can be regarded as a middle class revolution. Compared to previous
student movements, this year's student movements were supported by
almost all sections of society, particularly the middle class.

Umpire throws the book at Kuerten 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten lost approximately a quarter of his
prize money at the French Open for his outburst Tuesday. Kuerten,
frustrated in the tie-break of his doubles match, threw his racket
at the umpire, landing him a fine of dlrs 7,000 on Wednesday. This
fine takes a big chunk out of his prize money at the French Open
this year.
	   Kuerten's pocketbook was already suffering in comparison to last
year when he won the tournament and made around dlrs 617.000, more
than twenty times what he made this year.
	     ---  
	   LOST AND FOUND: The Williams sisters are out of the tournament
but their trademark beads have more staying power on the court.
It's not unusual to see a bead or two fall unto the clay court
during a match but in Venus' fourth round match against Henrieta
Nagyova ball girls and boys even found an entire string of beads.
	   The string of beads was added to the pile of rackets and
T-shirts left on the courts by the players. At the end of the
tournament all the lost and found treasures are raffled off among
the ball girls and boys.
	     ---  
	   A DOG'S LIFE: An unusual sight Tuesday when Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario's mother was seen running with her daughter's Yorkshire
terrier Roland in a quiet corner of the stadium just before
Arantxa's match against Patty Schnyder.
	   The object of the exercise was to tire the dog so it would stay
quiet during the match reported the French sports daily, L'Equipe.
	   The top dog, named after Roland Garros, can get into the stadium
and has its own pass with name and ID-picture for the duration of
the tournament.
	     ---  
	   STAY OFF THE GRASS: What's wrong with grass ? Quite a lot if you
believe some of the French Open players.
	   Spanish players are notorious for saying that grass is for cows.
Marat Safin, the Russian surprise who lost to Cedric Pioline in the
quarterfinals, said he ``didn't step on the grass. Never, no step
in my life.''
	   Wednesday Belgian Filip DeWulf gave yet another reason for not
playing tennis on grass. ''On grass, I'd rather play soccer,'' he
said.
	     ---  
	   REMEMBERING NOAH: When asked to name a past winner of the French
Open nearly half of the people polled, 46 percent, named 1983
winner and Frenchman Yannick Noah. Bjorn Borg was also well
remembered with 29 percent. 16 percent named John McEnroe. Current
French quarterfinalist Cedric Pioline was named by 4 percent.
	   Over on the women's side French nationalism did not reign.
Respondents most remembered Martina Navratilova (30 percent).
Surprisingly French national Mary Pierce came next with 26 percent
before multiple titleholders Steffi Graf (26 percent) and Chris
Evert (14 percent). Current favorite Martina Hingis was named by 4
percent.
	   The poll was carried out over phone on a cross section of the
French population over 15 years old by a French polling agency at
the request of one of the tournaments sponsors.

Iran: German condemned to death for sex should be retried 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A German businessman who was condemned to
death for having sex with an Iranian woman appeared to be off death
row late Wednesday when state-radio broadcast that he was to be
retried.
	   A spokesman for Iran's chief justice, Ali Abbassifard, said that
because Helmut Hofer claimed to have converted to Islam before the
incident occurred, his case would be retried by a new court, the
radio reported.
	   The retrial means in effect that the death sentence has been set
aside and the new court will issue its own verdict and, if
necessary, sentence.
	   The second court was already studying Hofer's case, Abbassifard
said.
	   In January, an Iranian court sentenced Hofer, 54, to death after
convicting him of violating Iranian law by having sex with a
26-year-old medical student, who was Muslim while he was not.
	   The Bonn government warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed,
German-Iranian relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's
biggest trading partner in the Europe Union.
	   Last month, the chief justice, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, said
Hofer's case would be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Brazil starts post-Romario era with easy 3-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with detail; WILL be UPDATED with quotes.
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ST. OUEN, France (AP) _ Brazil worked through its dramatic loss
of 1994 World Cup hero Romario but failed to get a stern final test
for France '98 Wednesday, getting first-half goals from Giovanni
and Rivaldo in an easy 3-0 victory over Andorra.
	   Giovanni and Rivaldo scored in the 26th and 27th minutes and
Cafu completed the scoring in the 53rd minute as Brazil coasted in
its final warm-up match before the World Cup opener against
Scotland June 10.
	   Bebeto took the place in the starting lineup for Romario, who
was cut from the squad Tuesday after re-injuring his right calf
last weekend.
	   After a tearful farewell, the players were in low spirits in
practice Tuesday.
	   The Brazilians hardly looked themselves as they sleepwalked
through the opening minutes, failing to press an Andorran team that
seemed awed to be on the same field as the four-time world
champions.
	   Andorra took nine minutes to cross the midfield stripe and never
seriously threatened Brazilian keeper Taffarel.
	   But Brazil wasted countless chances as Andorran defenders
repeatedly turned over the ball and forced goalkeeper Koldo Alvarez
into several dramatic saves.
	   The first of many misses came in the eighth minute, when
Giovanni took a cross from Cafu and fired a header point blank that
Alvarez knocked away with a reflex save.
	   Two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo had a long and
frustrating afternoon.
	   Alvarez seemed to have the shaven-headed 21-year-old figured
out, twice foiling him one-on-one on breakaways as Brazil
repeatedly caught the Andorran defense flat-footed.
	   Mistakes caught up with Andorra in the 26th minute, when the
defense failed to clear a Bebeto corner and the ball squirted loose
in the goal box. Giovanni, unmarked, simply tapped the ball into
the goal.
	   A minute later, Ronaldo sent Rivaldo in alone and the FC
Barcelona star had time to stop, choose his corner and shoot to
make it 2-0.
	   Ronaldo's frustrations grew in the 38th minute when a cross from
Cafu found him alone in front of Alvarez, but his header hit the
post.
	   Bebeto didn't help his chances to retain the starting spot with
an ineffective afternoon. His best chance came in the 44th minute
when Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo combined to leave him free at the
top of the penalty area, but his shot went high and wide.
	   In the second half, Doriva replaced captain Dunga, who is
recovering from a leg injury and was only expected to play 45
minutes.
	   Leonardo also came in for Giovanni.
	   Brazil's dominance grew in the second half as the team attacked
with as many as nine players, something it only does in practice _
which it at times seemed like it was.
	   In the 53rd minute, Cafu completed the scoring on a brilliant
individual effort. He escaped up the right side and, as Alvarez as
raced out to smother an expected cross, the defender feinted around
him and shot with almost no angle to make it 3-0.
	   The rest of the afternoon was a personal show by Ronaldo, who
successive runs through the Andorran defense drew ``oohs'' and
``aahs'' from the crowd.
	   But again he was disarmed at the last second.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo substituted freely, sending in
Carlos Germano for Tafarrel, Goncalves for Aldair, Ze Carlos for
Roberto Carlos, and Denilson for Rivaldo.

<TEXT>
	   Megawati Soekarnoputri, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding president Sukarno and chairwoman of the unrecognized
Indonesian Democratic Party, has managed to impress many of us
again by calling on all Indonesians to stop defiling fallen
president Soeharto. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the day on
which the nation's state philosophy Pancasila was born -- June 1,
1945 -- Megawati said defiling former leaders of the state runs
against Pancasila which, among other things, advocates ``just and
civilized humanitarianism''. ``Do we have to replace our state
leaders through such treatment every time?'' Megawati asked her
audience of several thousand, obviously referring to her own
father's ouster by Soeharto in 1966.
	   To be fair, Megawati is not the only, or even the first,
opposition leader to have called for temperance in the public
airing of anti-Soeharto sentiments following the strongman's forced
retirement on May 21. Moslem leader Amien Rais made a similar
appeal two days earlier and we can be sure that the same spirit of
moderation and forgiveness exists among many others of the more
reasonable and more mature of Indonesia's opposition leaders.
	   What makes Megawati's appeal for moderation worth noting is the
fact that it was made by the daughter of the deposed president
Sukarno, a victim of almost identical circumstances which led to
the birth of the New Order, headed by Soeharto. Unlike other
opposition figures who have made similar appeals, Megawati and her
family endured the same agony of being publicly defiled when her
father, Sukarno, was ousted in the wake of the communist coup of
1965.
	   Even after so many years, a sense of injury, perhaps even more
than magnanimity, can be detected in the question she asked her
audience: ``Do we have to treat former president Soeharto's family
the way the nation treated us, Sukarno's family, in 1965?'' But
apart from deep personal insight coming from experience, Megawati
probably also remembered and appreciated the way Soeharto had in
public always continued to accord Sukarno the respect he deserved
as a founder of the nation.
	   'Mikul duwur mendem jero', which literally means carry your
elders high and bury them deep, is a saying that is still honored
by many Indonesians, the Javanese in particular. Megawati could
only be observing this dictum when she made her appeal for
Indonesians to stop bashing Soeharto. Indonesia's younger
generation could see in this old tradition of chivalry a useful
modern guide to engaging in politics without abandoning morality --
a useful general principle to remember if democracy is to survive
and bloom. It is important, however, at this point to remember that
civility must not stand in the way of justice.
	   At this stage of developments, the public clamor concerns the
wealth which Soeharto and his family are widely reported to have
amassed during his more than three decades in power. The public's
demands that this wealth be returned to the state in as far as it
has been illegally acquired must in this context be given the
proper attention they deserve. Just as much as the Soeharto clan,
or their associates, have a right to be treated fairly, so the
people have a right to reclaim what belongs to them.
	   Indonesians at this stage of their country's history need the
guidance of leaders who are not only sincerely committed to the
cause of overall reform, but who are also mature and sensible
enough to see the nation safely through these critical times. It is
in this context that the calls for Indonesians to stop the Soeharto
bashing must be seen as a welcome development.

Residents rush to German train crash to help bloodied victims With AM-Germany-Train Derails

<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ There was a boom. An explosion. Then a
horrible crushing sound.
	   Hannelore Domkewitz saw the train speed past from her kitchen
window where she stood peeling potatoes. She had just a moment to
reflect that it was moving much faster than usual.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Domkewitz said.
	   The silence didn't last long. There were screams from the
tracks. Domkewitz ran 100 yards (300 feet) toward the mangled
wreckage of Germany's deadliest train crash in more than three
decades.
	   People with bloodied hands staggered toward her.
	   Behind them was a ghostly scene of passenger cars wedged into
each other, some sticking up several yards (meters) into the air
and others buried under a collapsed overpass.
	   The train, holding up to 350 passengers, had been speeding along
at 200 kph (125 mph) when cars derailed and jack-knifed, killing
scores of people.
	   Domekewitz ran back to get blankets and bed sheets to cover the
injured and dead. ``But there were also survivors who went by with
their luggage. They were all in shock,'' Domkewitz said, her voice
breaking.
	   Mark Draeger heard it too. ``It was like an explosion! Yet very
different, because it was a terrible crushing sound,'' said the
20-year-old aid worker who lived nearby and rushed to the wreckage.
	   Within an hour, the rails were swarming with rescue workers and
helicopters carrying the injured to hospitals. Residents along the
tracks rushed to the scene with small wagons to offer help.
	   Manfred Thiel was on his way to work when the train crashed. He
grabbed a ladder and helped the injured to safety. He stood by as
rescuers pulled a 10-year-old girl from the wreckage alive.
	   Color Sergeant Phil Forsyth and 20 soldiers from the 2nd
Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, based at Celle in Germany, were
among the first to arrive at the site.
	   Sgt Forsyth, speaking in a BBC interview from the regiment's
base just minutes from the crash scene, said: ``On arrival we were
met by an horrific site.
	   ``Some five or six carriages were piled up on top of each other.
Once we got nearer it became quite clear the bridge had totally
collapsed on to the second and third carriages, and the remainder
of the carriages had piled up on top of that.
	   ``All the carriages were absolutely mangled; it was a mess and
very sad to see.
	   ``My heart can do nothing but go out to those people who were
caught up in it and those who were waiting to find out what had
happened.''
	   Sgt Forsyth, who has been in the Army for 13 years and fought in
the Persian Gulf war, added: ``It is definitely one of the worst
scenes I have ever seen, if not the worst.''

	   As a man of performing art, I always look forward to seeing good
performance, let it be theatre, dance, mime or music. Of late, such
a desire of mine, my thirst for a good artistic performance, has
more than been satisfied. It was Leela Samson and her troupe's
dance performance which I had the opportunity of watching on the
27th May evening at the comfortable auditorium of Dhaka Museum.
	   This was Leela's third visit to Bangladesh. I have had the
opportunity of watching Leela's solo performance a few years ago at
a posh hotel of the city, which I kept nourishing for quite
sometime. This time Leela Samson came to Dhaka with her repertory
company named Spanda on invitation from a local front-ranking Dance
Group called Shadhana who deserve unequivocal appreciation for
their relentless struggle to establish classical and neo-classical
dance form in the country.Leela Samson is one of the great
exponents of Bharat Natyam, a highly acclaimed aesthetic dance form
of the sub-continent.
	   Leela has been recognised within and outside her country India
for her exquisite and sensitive handling of the medium with new to
newer interpretation of the thematic content of the respective
dance numbers. Leela has been awarded the ``Sanskriti Award'' in
1982 and the ``Padma Shree'' in 1990 which are quite rated in
India. She has also written a book on dance, titled Rhythm in Joy.
This time Leela came to tour Bangladesh with a 9-member team
including herself. Out of 9 performers, two are male and seven are
female dancers. Out of 9 performers, 6 are extraordinarily gifted
artists. They are Anusha Lall, Aditi Jaitly, C.A. Joy, Mahalakshmi
Narendra, T.M.
	   Thiru Chelwam - and of course, Leela herself is there. Of the
dancers, excluding Leela, to my mind, Anusha Lall stands out from
the rest of the team with her deft movement and gait, rhythmic foot
work and highly expressive but thrifty gestures which tend to give
a philosophical insight into the medium. Generally speaking, all
the members of the team are endowed with these qualities with only
variations of degree. The team also included Aditi Rao, Ayeshe Sadr
and Kamal Jit Malik who are talented young dancers now studying
Bharat Natyam under Leela's able guidance.The troupe performed 6
drama pieces including a solo piece by Leela Sampson, the
choreographer of the entire presentation. First presentation was
AAKASH meaning the Universe.
	   The theme of the dance drama is that, a person who knows that he
or she is endowed with the same strength outside and within, he or
she attains prosperity. The performance was beautifully harmonised
by vocal songs and instruments like flute, Mridangam, Chenda and
Maddalam. Then was presented the piece SPANDA-MATRIK. This was
rather a long piece, but never boring, with lots of variations in
``Mudra'' (gestures and postures). SPANDA-MATRIK expresses the
essence of motion through adavus' which constitutes the core
gestures and postures of Bharat Natyam. This composition attempts
to internationalise the consciousness of the dancer in one level
and on the other level, it creates an awareness in the dancer about
the external surroundings. SPANDA-MATRIK is based on time cycles of
4, 3, 7, 5 and 9 depicting ``Panchajaties''.
	   The audience had a recess of 10-minutes after the performance of
SPANDA-MATRIK. After recess, the performance resumed and the
curtain was drawn with the presentation of 4 relatively small
pieces of dance drama, namely DVASUPARNA, SURYA NAMASHKAR, ABHINOY
and CHARISHNU, DVA-SUPARNA depicted the life cycle of two birds
leaving together on a branch of tree with their joy and sorrow
which attempted to give an inner-view of our own life cycle. Then
came the SURYA NAMASKAR (Bow to sun) with extraordinary varieties
of rhythm and composition which, I thought, one would like to
cherish for a long time to come as a happening of pure joy. Next
piece was ABHINOY, a solo performance by Leela Sampson, an
articulate and over-stretched movement of hand and face which tend
to remind Japanese ``Kabuki' form.
	   The performance concluded with CHARISNU which expressed the joy
of the journeying.' In the bare stage of Dhaka Museum auditorium
covered with black back-drop and black wings and boarder, the
performances of the Repertoire of Leela Samson was spell-binding
with immaculate outfit of the dancers assisted by meaningful use of
lights. I would not say that the Repertoire's presentation was
spectacular but it was obviously suave, profound, intense,
sensitive, thought-provoking and above all, artistically
meaningful. By being suave it did not lack vigour and splendour of
dance performances.
	   It was indeed a new experience for me and I am at loss to use a
proper attribution. I met Leela Samson briefly the morning
following the May 27 evening's performance of her troupe. She told
me, a pure art form never becomes a museum piece if one can
practice it with sincerity and earnestness. If one has a heart for
it, it keeps on living and moving with all social relevance. For
that an artist does not need to modify, change, contemporise or
update the medium. Leela claimed that she did not deviate a bit
from the basics of Bharat Natyam, she only created themes to be
enacted through Bharat Natyam.
	   Is it, what is called re-creation or new interpretation? I kept
on pondering. Leela lastly told me that Bangladeshi enthusiasts
will one day succeed in breaking the barrier of obstacles and be
able to establish artistically rich dance form in the country, if
they can live upto their present zeal and endeavour. May be, the
field will be limited but an art form spans finite to infinite. In
fact, a pure art form never dies. I am inspired to quote two lines
from Upanishad the spirit of which is the driving force of Leela's
Repertoire: ``Who would breathe, who would live, if there were not
this bliss in space.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Greek experts who inspected military facilities in

Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, a news agency said Wednesday.
	   The treaty, signed in 1990 in Paris, set out country-by-country
limits on troops and conventional weapons.

	   Appreciation of fine arts, especially paintings, denotes the
spiritnal edification of a nation. The study of history informs us
that most ancient civilisations that upheld the values that
compliment the finer qualities of life, attained cultural
fulfilment. Painting is a section of art that is a vivid expression
of the refinement of the soul. Breaking all cultural barriers, it
is one language that the hearts of millions of people understand
and relish. ``Beauty in itself is a language that is capable of
silent lucidity'' - espousing this belief, an exhibition of
paintings by Korean artists was inaugurated last week at the Divine
Art Gallery at the Sonargaon Hotel.
	   In the rich tradition of 5000 years comes the animated works of
the orient. Korean painting is as old as her ancient civilisation
that often is an unknown fact. 'To introduce our works and their
richness to the Bangladeshi culture and to create a bridge of
friendship is our objective here,'' remarked the leader of the
Korean delegation. The distinct style that the works present is a
combination of intricate strokes blessed by a mesmerising, often
metaphysical effect. The works unveil the oriental definition of
the word beauty'. Sending a feeling of stillness through the
colours and their shades, these works open another world where
magnificence is somewhat different.
	   The mountains graced by waterfalls, the oriental-style bungalow
within the impeccable wilderness, the composed nature - flawless
and free from any sort of artificial element - make the paintings a
treat for the beauty-starved mind. The exhibition also features a
trend called Korean Powdered Jewel style. This form of art - not
familiar to us - exposes a new dimension of painting capable of
arresting one's rapt attention. ``This is vivid, eloquent and
somewhat more lively than something I have ever seen before,''
remarked a bedazzled Mehdi. In this category comes the almost
hypnotical piece called Forest. Standing in front of it, one tends
to substitute the cool surrounding of the Sonargaon lounge with
that of the lonely forest.
	   The eyes are caught, the body stands still as deep within the
picture the enraptured soul travels to the cold forest. Looking at
the Powdered works is experiencing a soul-flight that leaves one
satisfied, appreciative of the beauties still left in this
mechanical world. This exhibition reveals a new trend of art
exuding a magical aura. The works have been done with great
intensity as each piece narrates the cultural modes of a Far
Eastern society. The centre-piece of the paintings is the vibrant,
colourful Waves at Sunset - a stirring and animated expression of
the rough beauty of the seawaves seen through the eyes of a painter
spellbound by the twilight. The wonderful synthesis between the
nature and life is presented artistically, invigorating the finer
senses. This initiative to introduce Korean art will prove to be
fruitful as interchange of ideas will result in the advancement of
this field in both countries. A lovely experience and a dip into
the Oriental elegance, this exhibition is a laudable step.

Iran: German condemned to death for sex will be retried 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A German businessman who was condemned to
death for having sex with an Iranian woman appeared to be off death
row late Wednesday when state-radio broadcast that he was to be
retried.
	   A spokesman for Iran's chief justice, Ali Abbassifard, said that
because Helmut Hofer claimed to have converted to Islam before the
incident occurred, his case would be retried by a new court, the
radio reported.
	   The retrial means in effect that the death sentence has been set
aside and the new court will issue its own verdict and, if
necessary, sentence.
	   In January, an Iranian court sentenced Hofer, 54, to death after
convicting him of violating Iranian law by having sex with a
26-year-old medical student, who was Muslim while he was not.
	   The Bonn government warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed,
German-Iranian relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's
biggest trading partner in the Europe Union.

Central bank issues silver World Cup coin

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's central bank on Wednesday
issued a silver coin with an engraved soccer net to commemorate the
upcoming World Cup.
	   The symbolic sum of lei 100 (dlrs 0.011) with the zeros as
soccer balls, is written inside the net on one side. The Eiffel
Tower and the words ``World Cup France - 1998'' adorn the flip
side, Central Bank official Nicolae Mitea said by telephone.
	   Mitea said each coin weighs 27 grams (0.8 ounces) and has a
retail value of 132,000 lei (dlrs 16).
	   The bank distributed 5,000 coins to bank branches nationwide
Wednesday.
	   ``Their numismatic value will increase in time,'' Mitea said.
	   Romania and England are considered the front-runners in World
Cup Group G, which also includes Colombia and Tunisia.

	   NattojoAn Production staged its new drama Ghritang Pibet at the
Guide House auditorium on May 30. Adopted from Promothnath Bishi's
work, the play is directed by Tabibul Islam. Ghritang Pibet is a
comedy. Sarbeswar was a poor man. He lived in a modest house. He
was very keen to betroth her only one daughter, Pramira, to a rich
person. He took on rent a big house named, Sunny Villa, in an
aristocratic area. He thought that if he lived in a place like
this, some handsome person of a wealthy family would be attracted
to her daughter. He wanted to show himself as a rich man to others.
Tridib was a chauffeur. He also wanted to marry a daughter of a
rich person. One day, he went to the Sunny Villa and introduced
himself as the son of a Zamindar.
	   Pramira and Tridib felt in love at a first sight. Sarbeswar
didn't want to lose this chance. He decided to give Pramira in
marriage to Tridib. Thus Sarbeswar and Tridib both cheated each
other. After marriage, the truth came out. They didn't apologise to
each other, but both realised that money is not the only thing to
be happy.This is the story of Ghritang Pibet. Monir Khan Shimul as
Tridib, Ahsanul Haque Minu as Sarbeswar, Farzana Hosain Kongkon as
Malobika, Tazin Ahmed as Pramira, and Chittrolekh Guho as Bijoya
have done justice to their roles.
	   It is the second production of Nattojoan. The direction is good.
The director has used some old melodious songs to create the right
atmosphere for some scenes, such as: Vishmadev Chattapadhya's Bhala
mora man bhabe murali bajae; Ram Kumar Chattapadhya's Oi dekha jai
bari amar chwdike malancha bera and Jabo natun sasur bari, Allahde
jai garagori; K. L. Saigal's Ekhoni uthibe chand adho alo adho
chhayate; and Ganendraprasad Goswami's Baje mridanga buia baje
murali. Professor Anisuzzaman was the chief guest at the premiere
show.
	   He congratulated Nattojoan Production on staging Promothnath
Bishi's Ghritang Pibet, an almost forgotten but once well known
drama. Borisho dhara majhe shantiro barii was the opening song of
the show. The audience enjoyed the play. Oriental excellence on

Eds: ADDS in 4th graf investigation led by former Botswana
<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The Organization of African
Unity on Wednesday appointed a seven-member panel to investigate
the role of foreign powers and individuals in the 1994 Rwandan
genocide.
	   OAU Secretary General Salim Salim of Tanzania said the
investigation team would also examine measures to prevent a
re-occurrence of the massacres which resulted in about 500,000
deaths, mainly of ethnic Rwandan Tutsis.
	   Tutsi rebels based mainly in Uganda won power in Rwanda in July
1994 and ended the killings, which occurred several months after a
U.N. peacekeeping officer warned his superiors in a fax of the
danger of massacres planned by Hutu extremists.
	   OAU officials did not immediately provide details about the
terms of the new investigation, which will be led by newly-retired
Botswana president Ketumile Masire.
	   Also appointed to the panel are former Mali president Gen.
Toumani Toure; Algeria's ex-chairman of the International Court of
Justice Mohamed Bedjaou; former U.N. official and Liberian
presidential candidate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf; one-time U.N.
Development Program chief Lisbet Palme of Sweden; former Indian
Supreme Court chairman H. Bagwati and UNICEF deputy chief Stephen
Lewis of Canada.
	   The investigation team was first suggested by Ethiopian Prime
Minister Ato Meles Zewani in November 1997.
	   A U.N. tribunal on Rwanda has indicted 35 people with genocide
crimes.
	   Rwanda, frustrated by the slow pace of the U.N. tribunal, has
started its own trials of 125,000 suspects. So far, 144 of 337
convicted have received death sentences.

	   TANGERANG (JP): At least 75 youth activists visited the local
council here to demand that Mayor Djakaria Machmud resign
immediately from his current post.
	   Calling themselves the Tangerang Rescuers Forum (FPT), the
youths told councillors on Monday that Djakaria had visibly failed
to carry out his duties.
	   The group spokesman T.B. Mahdi Ardiansyah cited the mayor's
failure to curb the levy of illegal fees on the issue of identity
cards as an example of his incompetence.
	   Payments required to obtain an ID card in the mayoralty are now
Rp 75,000 per card, 10 times higher than the official rate of Rp
7,500, he said.
	   He also pointed to the Tangerang forest park, developed to
provide a recreation site for families in the heart of the
municipality, but which has become notorious for prostitution,
crime and dating teenagers, Ardiansyah explained.
	   ``The city forest park has provided more bad things than good
things,'' he said.
	   The group insisted councillors sign a statement promising that
they would not support any attempt by Djakaria to stand for a
second term in office later this month.
	   After listening to the youths' requests, councillors -- led by
speaker Dedy Moeljono -- requested permission to retire to hold an
internal discussion so that they could come to a consensual
agreement.
	   The youths finally agreed to give them 15 minutes.
	   Later, Dedy and fellow councillors Rusman Umar and Syafruddin
--respectively from the Armed forces, Golkar and United Development
Party factions -- came out to meet the protesters again.
	   The councillors claimed that Djakaria's term had come to an end
earlier that day and he had submitted his resignation letter six
months previously, as required by the law.
	   Dedy did not reveal whether or not Djakaria had stated an
intention to stand for reelection in the letter.
	   He announced that the council would begin an investigation into
the allegations leveled at Djakaria by the protesters, but he and
his fellow councillors refused to sign the protesters' statement,
arguing that it was unconstitutional.
	   However, group leader Ahdiansyah persisted with his demand,
revealing at the same time his knowledge of rumors, rife in the
town, that each council member had received ``security fees'' worth
Rp 200 million from the mayor.
	   Ahdiansyah's remarks turned the councillors' faces red.
	   ``That's slander. We did not receive any bribes. We don't want
to sign the statement because it's unconstitutional,'' Rusman Umar
said emotionally.
	   Meanwhile, mayoralty spokesman Harry Mulya Zein said that all
charges associated with the issue of identity cards had been
stopped as of Monday.
	   The service is now free, he said.
	   ``We call on our officers in the districts and subdistricts to
uphold the policy,'' Harry added.
	   Regarding the forest park, he said the mayoralty would continue
their joint operation with local security forces in an attempt to
improve the park's image.
	   ``We are also waiting for a report on the alleged role of the
mayor in corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices which occurred
during his term in office,'' Harry said.
	   The law requires that an outgoing mayor be examined by a special
committee at the end of his or her term.

	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ A new fund to help the endangered
Siberian tiger is moving to aid fire-fighting efforts at two nature
reserves in eastern Russia, the World Wildlife Fund said Wednesday.
	   An allocation of some dlrs 20,000 is intended to buy and repair
fire-fighting vehicles and other equipment in the Lazovsky and
Sikhote-Alin reserves, home to the most of the surviving 425 to 475
wild Siberian tigers.
	   Unusually dry weather conditions in the area, near the Sea of
Japan, have led to forest fires which ``have already destroyed over
2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of prime tiger land,'' the WWF said in
a statement.
	   Dry weather is set to continue through the summer, with a high
risk of more fires, it added.
	   ``It is better to move now when the situation has not reached
gargantuan proportions than to wait and witness a serious
environmental catastrophe,'' said Jean-Pierre d'Huart, manager of
WWF's International Species Unit.
	   The Tiger Emergency Fund was set up in January by the WWF and
the World Conservation Union.
	   It is intended as a ``rapid-response mechanism'' for dealing
with any events increasing the threats to the tigers' survival.

	   JAKARTA (JP): West Jakarta Police chief Lt. Col. Timur Pradopo
and 17 other police and military members face prison terms of
between seven and 12 years if convicted of their alleged roles in
last month's Trisakti shooting, an officer said yesterday.
	   National Military Police Corps Commander Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalal
said yesterday that the West Jakarta Military District commander,
Lt. Col. Amril Amir, whose name had been among the 19 alleged
suspects, was eventually excluded from the list and released on
technical grounds.
	   ``We have to release him because we did not have enough evidence
to put him on trial,'' Syamsu told a media conference at his office
in Gambir subdistrict, Central Jakarta.
	   ``However, if fresh evidence is found, there is a chance that he
will also face the same charges,'' he added.
	   Syamsu refused to give the precise names and units of the other
17 suspects.
	   He only identified them as first lieutenants AH, WR, SR and ATH;
second lieutenants PY, EKS and BY; second sergeants DP, JE, TI, AY,
CN and PD; and second privates ST, SP, LS and IM.
	   He said that all of the 18 suspects would be brought before a
military court on Saturday and charged under Article 170 of the
Criminal Code for assaulting people with violence.
	   Four Trisakti University students were shot dead in the May 12
incident. Dozens of others were injured by bullets and batons. The
incident ignited public anger which became manifest in massive
riots, looting and burnings the next day. Nine days later,
president Soeharto resigned after 32 years in power.
	   Jakarta Military Police Commander Col. Hendardji, who also
attended yesterday's meeting, said that among the suspects, 10
admitted that they had fired their guns without authorization.
	   ``There was an order to shoot, but only warning shots, ricochet
shots,'' he said.
	   ``They opened fire on their own initiative, but not upon a
direct order from the field commander. The motive was merely to
herd the students back to the campus,'' he added.
	   He also said that one of the student fatalities, shot in his
neck, was the victim of ricochet shots.
	   He, however, said that the investigators were now seeking
testimony for why the firing began after the students had ended
their protest.
	   Hendardji also hinted at the possibility of procedural
violations while loading the troops' ammunition.
	   ``That's the reason why we also checked the line of distribution
of ammunition,'' he said, adding that the troops (dispatched at the
scene) were trained with live ammunitions at their base in Kelapa
Dua in Depok.
	   Hendardji was asked about when the officers took possession of
their live ammunition because reports showed that they had been
deployed at the campus for a whole week. He said: ``There were
times when they returned back to their base at Kelapa Dua.''
	   Asked about the National Police Chief Gen. Dibyo Widodo's
statement that the police officers did not commit procedural
violations during the incident, Hendardji suggested Dibyo
crosscheck his findings with other findings.
	   Syamsu said that the investigation had been conducted in line
with the legal procedure stated in Article 74 of the Armed Forces
Chief Decree No. 31/ 1997 on military procedures when handling
unrest.
	   He said that the team did not try to find scapegoats who would
be held responsible for the incident.
	   ``Only the court will decide on the responsible parties. We
(military investigators) always apply the principle of presumption
of innocence,'' he said.
	   Syamsu denied reports of a two-star general's involvement in the
shooting, as mentioned by several mass media.
	   ``I've never said that a two-star general was involved,'' he
said.
	   He, however, called for the public's active participation to
help the investigators reveal the truth of the case.
	   ``Anybody who witnessed officers from other units opening fire,
please inform us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   To trace the lineage of Alauddin Khan, one will have to unfold
several generations of musicians, but the name of Safdar Hossein
Khan is the great link in the chapter. He was born in
Brahmanbaria's Shibpur village. His father's name was Madai
Hossain. Safdar Hossein Khan, whose pet name was Shudokhan, had a
fascination for music since his boyhood, and grew up in an
atmosphere steeped in classical music. Safdar Hossein Khan became a
disciple of Ustad Qasim Ali Khan, rabab maestro, who was attached
to the Tripura Raja's court. After some time Safdar Hossein Khan
also received the patronage of the Raja of Tripura, and gained
considerable fame. Safdar Hossein Khan had five sons, namely,
Sonauddin Khan, Aftabuddin Khan, Alauddin Khan, Naib Ali Khan and
Ayat Ali Khan. Among the five sons, three made great names in the
field of classical music. Aftabuddin Khan was a spiritualist and,
like a wandering minstrel, used to roam from place to place without
any fixed abode.
	   One day he was visible in some remote village and another day he
was seen in Comilla and other towns. He used to frequent the akhras
of Baul singers. Aftabuddin Khan was adept to the musical
instruments, tabla, flute and harmonium. He could also play the
dotara like a Baul. There is a story that one day Aftabuddin Khan
visited the house of Maharaja Jogindranath at Natore Bhaban in
Bhawanipur, Calcutta. It was early morning and the Moharaja
welcomed Aftabuddin Khan and seated him in his jalsa ghar. After a
while Aftabuddin Khan dressed in fakir's robes took out his flute
from the folds of his alkhalla and began to play some notes. It was
seen that gradually flocks of birds flew into the large hall and
settled on the pillars and window sills.
	   The birds remained calm and there was pin-drop silence in the
room. Only when he finished playing the flute did the birds fly out
and went away. It was an eye-witness account by Maharaja
Jogindranath, reflecting the spiritual powers of the maestro.It was
at the feet of such a great man that Alauddin Khan received his
initial training. His father had affectionately named him Alam (the
world) and gave him much attention. One day he decided to leave
Shibpur and went to Dhaka where he joined a professional jatra
troupe. He spent some time here and also joined the Lion Theatre in
old town, Dhaka. Not content with the small world of Dhaka, he
moved on to seek the gurus of Calcutta.
	   One famous vocal musician was Nolu Gopal alias Gopal Krishna
Bhattacharya, who had a good following, and Alauddin begged him to
accept him as his disciple. The guru said he would take him into
his tutelege provided Alauddin agreed to spend at least 12 years
with him. He devoted himself to his teacher and spared no pains in
following his every instruction. After the elapse of seven years
unfortunately the guru passed away and Alauddin was heart-broken.
He gave up his vocal training and later took up instrumental music.
For a time he was employed in Minerva Theatre of Calcutta, but took
the opportunity to learn western-style behala under the guidance of
a Mr Lobo, and the local style of behala from Mr. Amar Das. He
learnt pakhawaj under the expert hand of mridang musician Mr. Nanda
Babu. In this way he furthered his knowledge of a variety of
instruments and even learnt the clarinet from Mr. Habu Dutt and
shenai from Hazari Ustad.
	   In short, he became master of many instruments and could handle
each one with ease.At this time he attended the court of Raja Jagat
Kishore and received accolades from the raja. He also had the
opportunity to meet Ustad Ahmed Ali Khan in the court and heard him
play. Alauddin Khan entreated the Ustad to make him disciple, and
through the recommendation of Raja Jagat Kishore, he was bestowed
with the honour.For the next four years he learnt sarod at the feet
of Ustad Ahmed Ali Khan. Alauddin Khan harboured a deep desire to
visit Rangpur and very soon he fulfilled his wish. In the
beginning, despite his efforts to meet the famous Ustad Wazir Khan
he could not make headway, the guards turning him away on many
occasions. One day he was so depressed that he decided to commit
suicide and even purchased two tolas of opium. By chance a
sympathetic maulvi who used to live in his quarters prevented him
and showed him a way-out.
	   He offered to write a petition to the Nawab of Rampur, asking
for an opportunity to become student of the famous court ustad. As
the Nawab was proceeding to a theatre, Alauddin Khan threw himself
in front of the car, forcing it to stop. He could hardly express
himself in Urdu and with difficulty he picked up the courage to
say: ``Sir, I beg you to help me. I wish to learn sarod from Ustad
Wazir Khan.'' The Nawab brushed him aside and ordered the car to
move on, Alauddin Khan quickly took out the opium chunk from his
pocket and desperately showed it to the Nawab saying: ``I will die
right here, if you do not help me.'' He pushed the petition into
the hands of the Nawab begging him to read it. The Nawab read and
then said ``All right, come to my court tomorrow and make your
presentation. We will hear it.''Next day he played several of the
instruments in which he attained some excellence and the listeners
were impressed with the talent he displayed.
	   The Nawab expressed his approval and Ustad Wazir Ali Khan
accordingly tied the nara, the sacred thread given as token to a
disciple, on the wrist of Alauddin Khan. He learnt for 12 years in
the gharana' of Wazir Khan and his devotion became proverbial.In
1918 the Nawab of Rampur sent him to the state of Maihar, where he
was employed as a state musician. The Raja of Maihar was a very
generous man, and spent lavishly on patronising new talent. His
state was not very large but had gained status as an important
centre for classical music, all over India. He established a deep
and close relationship with the Raja of Maihar, who reciprocated
whole-heartedly their friendship, respect and admiration for each
other lasted till the death of Ustad Alauddin Khan.It is worth
noting that Alauddin Khan created new ragas and raginis, for
instance, hemant, prabhat keli, hem-behag, madan-manjali.
	   The British government bestowred the title of Khan Sahib and the
Biswa Bharati gave him Deshi-Kottam while Dhaka University gave him
honorary degree of Doctors of Law. He also received Padma Bhushan
and Padma Bhibushan from the Indian government. He had among his
disciples many who became famous students of his gharana. Among
them were Timir Baran, Panna Lal Ghosh, Ali Akbar Khan, Ravi
Shankar and his own daughter Roshanara Begum alias Annapurna, Saran
Rani and others to name a few. He was the guru of Uday Shankar and
helped him with his orchestra for several years.In 1950 I went to
Maihar to become the Ustad's disciple and stayed for a short while,
but as the Ustad was returning to Dhaka soon after, I also
returned. Eventually he handed me over to Ustad Khadim Hossain
Khan, his loved disciple.
	   As our family had a close association with Ustad Alauddin Khan,
my father and uncle being patrons of music, I was fortunate to sit
at his feet on many occasions. One of the Ustad's violins was in
the house of my chacha Mirza Abdul Qadir in Islampur, which he used
to play when he visited that house on some occasions.I remember one
incident when Ustad Alauddin Khan came to Dhaka from Comilla and I
and several friends took initiative to request Mr. Osman Ghani
Khan, the Provost, to hold a function at Salimullah Muslim Hall. On
the evening of the function, a large crowd of students gathered and
the Ustad went up to the stage and sat with his shagrids. But there
was a lot of commotion in the hall, some students were shouting,
gossiping and smoking cigarettes.
	   It appeared that the function would be disturbed and spoilt. But
gradually as the Ustad settled down and began the first few notes
on his sarod, the whole atmosphere became changed, and the magic of
his notes spread over the listeners. Along with the Ustad were
Bahadur Hossein on the sarod, and Khadim Hossein Khan on the sitar
while Abid Hossein was on the taanpura. Two great maestros were on
the tabla: Phuljhari Khan and Mohammd Hossein Khan. They played for
two hours, and the enrapt audience gave calls of encore. The
maestro stood up, took his violin and like a conductor, led the
orchestra to play tilak kamod, a very favourite raag of his. Such a
beautiful and over-powering presentation has hardly ever been seen
since then. The whole hall was acclaiming with praise and clappings
the brillant performance.After the show Ustad Alauddin Khan came to
our Islampur house at 11 pm for dinner.
	   He said his prayers and then sat down in the mehfil, saying: ``I
am going to enjoy Kabuli (a Dhaka dish of renown) with you all, but
I also have something to give you. I will present raag hemant for
your pleasure.'' He played for about twentyfive minutes, to an
enraptured audience.I would like to also narrate an incident which
took place in Paris around 1935 or 1936 when he accompained Uday
Shankar's troupe. Ustad Alauddin Khan recalled the event himself
recorded in Mubarak Hossein's book on the Ustad. To quote the
maestro: ``It was May 5, a beautiful spring evening, when several
European and American dancers and musicians came to my hotel to
hear me play. I began lightly, playing five or seven taan in
bilambit taal, whey I glanced up at their faces and saw tears in
their eyes. Instantly I shook away my lethargy and realised that my
listeners were very sensitive.
	   I began playing with great depth and concentration and found
that they continued to be deeply moved. I played Bhimpalasi and
Pilu for over three hours, so deep was the communication between
them and me.''At the end of his life he became paralytic and
confined to bed for several years. On 6 Setptember, 1973, he died
at the age of 103 in Maihar. His guru Wazir Ali Khan's gharana'
will be eternally remembered through this extraordinary musician
who came as a simple village lad from Comilla to Maihar, and
through his dedication and sacrifice reached the heights of musical
excellence.It is known that Uday Shankar went bare-footed in the
presence of Alauddin Khan, reflecting the devotion and honour of
the disciple for the Guru.

	   JAKARTA (JP): City councilors urged the city administration
yesterday to quickly reconsider its massive projects, most of which
have ground to a halt.
	   They said the administration should look into whether the
investors and developers of projects such as the triple-tier
transit system, the Jakarta Bay reclamation project and the subway
project could continue despite the crisis.
	   Fatommy Asaari, head of the Golkar faction, said investor and
developer commitment was very important for the quick completion of
the projects.
	   ``They postponed construction work as soon as the monetary
crisis hit the country. But we can't wait for too long,'' he told
The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   Ali Wongso Sinaga, head of Commission D for development, told
the Post that project contracts must be thoroughly reassessed with
the crisis in mind.
	   ``If the contracts produce more profit for the developers or
investors, then they (contracts) must be revised because the
administration is actually the one which owns the assets,'' he
said.
	   Ali said the administration should find new investors with
strong financial and technical backgrounds to manage the projects
if the current companies backed out.
	   ``But first we must allow the current developers to appraise us
of the situation,'' he added.
	   Fatommy shared Ali's view, saying that it was important for the
administration to quickly complete its projects since they were
very important for Jakarta's future.
	   ``Foreign investors and developers should be welcomed to
participate in the projects,'' he said.
	   The triple-tier transit system project, which is to connect
Bintaro in South Jakarta to downtown Kota, is managed by PT
Citramoda Margakencana Persada, a joint-venture company of PT Citra
Lamtorogung Persada, owned by former president Soeharto's eldest
daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, state railway company Perumka and
the state-owned highway corporation, PT Jasa Marga.
	   Construction for the project, which is not included in the
city's 1985/2010 revised urban spatial plan, started in March with
the opening of some work sites in Bintaro and the controversial
cutting down of some trees along Jl. Bendi Raya in Tanah Kusir,
also in South Jakarta. Construction was postponed in April due to
financial problems.
	   The Jakarta Bay reclamation project issues the rights to a total
of 2,700 hectares to several companies, including PT Manggala Krida
Yudha, owned by Soeharto's youngest daughter Siti Hutami Endang
Adiningsih.
	   Open bid
	   Ali said the project, which was backed by Presidential Decree
No. 52 issued in 1995, was not awarded through an open bid. Only
few of the earmarked locations have been reclaimed, he added.
	   The US$1.5 billion subway project to connect Blok M in South
Jakarta and the downtown Kota area is handled by a consortium in
which Soeharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo's company is
involved.
	   Fatommy said the city and the companies in the consortium had
welcomed Bambang's involvement in the project, which was originally
the administration's idea.
	   ``They hoped that Bambang's involvement could help them get
approval from the central government. But it turned out that the
Presidential Decree was not issued specifically to support the
subway but rather to cover Hardijanti's triple-tier project,'' he
said.
	   Fatommy said the administration should not review the projects
just because they were handled by companies owned by the family of
former president Soeharto.
	   ``Let's not look into who were behind the projects. I think it
would be better to see the importance of the projects for the
public. But, if there is proof that the companies are using the
projects to make huge profits, then we have to take strict
action,'' he said.

World Cup qualifiers draw 0-0 in unattractive exhibition

<TEXT>
	   CRETEIL, France (AP) _ Fellow World Cup qualifiers Mexico and
Saudi Arabia played to an unattractive 0-0 draw Wednesday, with
North Americans having most of the possession and the Saudis the
better scoring chances.
	   Playing before a crowd of 5,000 in a small venue, the Saudis
opened the game with an opportunity in the first minute when Khalid
al-Muwalid shot wide from one yard. And in the 22nd, Sami al-Jaber
couldn't head a ball from good position, with Mexican goalkeeper
Osvaldo Perez beaten.
	   Luis Garcia troubled the Saudis the most, but failed on three
chances. He shot high from 10 yards in the first half and wasting
two more opportunities in the second. On the first he shot wide
after receiving a pass from Luis Hernandez and was blocked by Saudi
Mohammed al-Dayea.
	   Mexico used an experimental lineup in which Garcia started up
front along side Ricardo Pelaez while regular strikers Hernandez
and Cuauhtemoc Blanco played wide midfield.
	   The experiment didn't seem particularly successful, but Mexican
coach Manuel Lapuente said he was ``satisfied'' with his team's
performance.
	   ``We made several changes in our lineup and played well at the
end,'' he said. ``During the World Cup you'll see a very different
team. Against South Korea (Mexico's first opponent) you'll see the
result of our job.''

	   TANGERANG (JP): The strike called by 1,200 employees of the
Istana Nelayan hotel and restaurant, which has remained closed
after being badly damaged during last month's riots, ended
peacefully after negotiations at the local manpower ministry office
yesterday.
	   The workers demanded their employer immediately terminate their
contracts and provide the appropriate severance pay and final
month's wages.
	   They said they had been asked to stay at home indefinitely after
the hotel was badly damaged on May 13 and since then had received
no further information from their employer.
	   Located on Jl. Gatot Subroto in Jatiuwung, the Istana Nelayan,
which also had a karaoke bar, live music and steambath service, had
long been thought to be a cover for prostitution.
	   With the help of Suaman, an official from the local manpower
ministry, and Samiri Sanja from the local branch of the
All-Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI), company executive Hangki
Sucipto and 10 representatives of the protesters reached a
compromise agreement on the dispute.
	   Under the deal struck today but backdated to June 1, 425 workers
agreed to resign.
	   ``Each worker will receive appropriate severance pay and a
letter of reference from Istana Nelayan,'' Hangki said, without
stating when these payments would be made.
	   Those who worked for more than five years with the company would
receive additional compensation equal to two month's salary, he
added.
	   Hangki promised to pay all the workers' May salaries, worth an
average of Rp 100,000 per person, on June 19.
	   The agreement apparently left all parties satisfied,
particularly the workers, who then left the ministry office
peacefully.
	   On the other side of town, 800 employees of PT Metropolitan
textile company went on strike for the third time in recent weeks
yesterday.
	   They insisted that the factory's owners increase their monthly
salaries, which are currently Rp 160,000 (US$16) per person, and
provide them with a transportation allowance.
	   According to the protesters, the firm has fired 260 of its 1,050
employees because of the economic crisis, but has steadfastly
refused to grant the remaining workers any form of wage increase.
	   None of the company's executives could be reached for comment
yesterday.

French put in hard day before dinner with a stately fan Eds : UPDATES with Chirac visit, quotes 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ While the French faced speculation
Wednesday on their World Cup starting lineup, President Jacques
Chirac was already practicing to hand them the trophy on July 12.
	   After watching the team work out Wednesday evening, Chirac
admitted he also was getting into shape for the World Cup.
	   ``I'm already practicing,'' he said. ``I think I'll be able to
give the ... Cup to the French on July 12.''
	   ``I have a strong intuition,'' he added.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet is holding his players in suspense after
juggling the lineup over the past two weeks. Rumors swirled that
even top scorer Youri Djorkaeff could be reduced to the bench for
France's June 12 opener against South Africa.
	   ``You cannot stick to what has already been set out. You need a
breath of fresh air,'' said Jacquet. ``I prefer movement, even if
it's not major.'' He did not shed light on what potential changes
he had in mind.
	   Chirac refused to get into the soccer politics of the starting
lineup.
	   ``They're all great,'' he said of the 22-strong squad. ``The
whole of France is mobilized behind them.''
	   The president ate dinner with with the players. His visit was a
welcome distraction for Djorkaeff after he was mentioned as a
possible ``superjoker,'' or ``SuperDjorker,'' to come off the bench
instead of a starting. He has been a key all through Jacquet's
four-year tenure and is the current top scorer with 17 goals in 37
games.
	   ``I'm part of the Jacquet system, I even partly created it. I
can't see why I should be excluded now. Why a joker,'' he said.
	   Jacquet's main selection problems have been up front, where
scoring is the main headache.
	   Offensively, the team has long been built around Zinedine Zidane
and Djorkaeff, but the sudden emergence of Thierry Henry and Robert
Pires on the wings could alter plans at the last moment, forcing
out a player in the middle.
	   Since Zidane's place is secure beyond any reasonable doubt,
Djorkaeff has become a target of speculation.
	   ``Personally I know I will be on the team against South
Africa,'' said Inter Milan's Djorkaeff. Denmark and Saudi Arabia
complete in Group C.
	   In midfield, Real Madrid's Christian Karembeu had been assumed
as a certainty, especially since he should be much fitter after
having played only half a season. But a disappointing few weeks
have cast major doubt on his place and increased the chances of
Arsenal Emmanuel Petit. Jacquet benched Karembeu for a preparation
game last week.
	   ``I was so frustrated. I wanted to play and I was on the bench,
powerless,'' he said.

Azerbaijan protests French vote on Armenia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijan objected Wednesday to a vote in the
French parliament to recognize the 1915 killings of ethnic
Armenians in Turkey as a genocide.
	   The motion, unanimously approved by the National Assembly on
Friday, now goes to the Senate. If it passes there, France would
become the first major European country to use the term
``genocide'' to describe the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million
Armenians in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923.
	   Turkey denies that the deaths constituted genocide, insisting
instead that they were the result of a civil war. Genocide is the
systematic annihilation of a racial, political or cultural group.
	   Azerbaijan shares ethnic, linguistic, Islamic and cultural ties
with Turkey and has a longstanding animosity toward its mainly
Christian neighbor, Armenia.
	   President Gaider Aliev expressed his disapproval of the French
action at a meeting with a French government delegation in the
Azerbaijani capital, Baku, the Interfax news agency said.
	   He said the resolution evoked protests and anxiety in
Azerbaijan, especially given France's membership in a group trying
to resolve the dispute with Armenia over the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Azerbaijan's Turan news agency said more than 150 people
picketed Wednesday outside the French Embassy in Baku. When
dispersed by police, the protesters moved on to the Turkish
Embassy, where they shouted slogans of support, Turan said.

URGENT
Eds: UPDATES with 100 confirmed dead, discrepancies in numbers of
With BC-Germany-High Speed Train
AP Photos
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ A high-speed passenger train derailed
Wednesday in northern Germany, killing at least 100 people and
seriously injuring scores as car after car of the train crumpled
into the concrete base of an overpass.
	   The crash _ Germany's deadliest rail disaster in 31 years _
happened at 11 a.m. as the Hamburg-bound train sped at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour approaching the station in Eschede,
50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The cause of the accident remained unclear, and authorities were
unable to account for discrepancies in the number of injured. The
Lower Saxony state Interior Ministry spokesman Frank Lukashweski
confirmed 100 bodies had been recovered and stood by reports of up
to 300 injured.
	   However, rescue coordinators, speaking at a news conference,
reported 40 injured.
	   Klaus Rathert, the chief regional rescue coordinator, told the
news conference that the front locomotive apparently decoupled from
the passenger cars, causing them to derail and jackknife into the
overpass.
	   The front locomotive traveled at least 500 meters (yards) from
the scene of the derailment, through the Eschede train station,
before the driver realized he'd lost the passenger cars, Rathert
said.
	   The station chief engaged the emergency brake, stopping the
locomotive about two kilometers (more than a mile) from the scene,
and thereby alerting the driver to the accident.
	   The account conflicted with earlier reports suggesting that an
auto had plunged into the train from the overpass, causing the
derailment.
	   Police said an automobile was crushed beneath the wreckage, but
it was unclear where the car was parked at the time of the
accident. They said it was probably sitting along the tracks, not
on the overpass.
	   Police spokesman Joachim Lindenberg told ARD television that the
auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the tracks.
He said that anyone that close to the accident could not have
survived. Neither Rathert nor Deutsche Bahn immediately confirmed
that account.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the rear engine stuck from under the
bridge, and three derailed cars were piled on each other beneath
the collapsed overpass.
	   At least 13 cars had derailed. The force of the pile-up pushed
cars meters (yards) high into the air along an embankment.
	   Survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the region. The Red
Cross chartered six buses to take most of the uninjured to Hamburg,
spokesman Harald Krueger said.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991.
	   A 1967 rail accident near Magdeburg in then-East Germany, killed
94 people in the deadliest rail accident since World War II. A
crossing barrier closed on a rail tanker filled with gasoline,
causing it to explode and spreading fire into passenger cars.
	   The worst accident in western Germany was in 1971, when a train
carrying children on a field trip collided with a freight train,
killing 46 people.
	   A Deutsche Bahn executive Johannes Ludewig, said he was ``deeply
dismayed and horrified by the proportions of this accident.''
	   Several of the rail cars were demolished, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage as
workers struggled to pry passengers from the train.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Christian Krettek, of University Hospital in Hanover, told CNN
that rescue workers expected the death toll to rise, and it was
still unclear if there were more dead inside the shattered train
cars.
	   A crane was positioned to lift chunks of the bridge to reach
cars underneath.
	   The accident closed train traffic in both directions. Federal
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, Lower Saxony state governor
Gerhard Schroeder and German railway executives were en route to
the scene.
	   The ICE train is Germany's fastest, connecting all major cities
at speed up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour. The train
travels from Munich to Hamburg, covering a distance of more than
950 kilometers (about 600 miles), in 5 hours and 37 minutes.
Regular train service takes more than eight hours.
	   The train that crashed Wednesday was a first-generation ICE
model powered by two electric-powered locomotives pulling up to 14
passenger cars with a capacity of 759 passengers. At top speed the
train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to an emergency
stop.
	   The high-speed trains carry more than 65,000 passengers daily.

bottle, a knife and several spoons and forks.
	   Judge Sri Koestati said in her verdict on Monday that the
defendant, identified as Hengki Karmano, broke into a house while
the owners were away.
	   ``The defendant had observed the status of the house so that he
knew when the house had been left by its owners,'' the judge said.
	   But when the defendant was about to leave the house with the
stolen goods, the owners returned and shouted for help, she said.
	   ``I stole to survive. I would have used part of the sales from
the stolen goods to buy cigarettes,'' the defendant was quoted by
the judge as saying.
	   Prosecutor Renny M. Pangaribuan said the defendant's act
violated Article 563 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum
sentence of one year in jail.
	   ``The defendant is a repeated offender, who has been jailed
several times for similar offenses,'' Renny said.

RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
With BC-Germany-Train Derails
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ There was a boom. An explosion. Then a
horrible crushing sound.
	   Hannelore Domkewitz saw the train speed past from her kitchen
window where she stood peeling potatoes. She had just a moment to
reflect that it was moving much faster than usual.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Domkewitz said.
	   The silence didn't last long. There were screams from the
tracks. Domkewitz ran 100 yards (300 feet) toward the mangled
wreckage of Germany's deadliest train crash in more than three
decades.
	   People with bloodied hands staggered toward her.
	   Behind them was a ghostly scene of passenger cars wedged into
each other, some sticking up several yards (meters) into the air
and others buried under a collapsed overpass.
	   The train, holding up to 350 passengers, had been speeding along
at 200 kph (125 mph) when cars derailed and jack-knifed, killing
scores of people.
	   Domekewitz ran back to get blankets and bed sheets to cover the
injured and dead. ``But there were also survivors who went by with
their luggage. They were all in shock,'' Domkewitz said, her voice
breaking.
	   Mark Draeger heard it too. ``It was like an explosion! Yet very
different, because it was a terrible crushing sound,'' said the
20-year-old aid worker who lived nearby and rushed to the wreckage.
	   Within an hour, the rails were swarming with rescue workers and
helicopters carrying the injured to hospitals. Residents along the
tracks rushed to the scene with small wagons to offer help.
	   Manfred Thiel was on his way to work when the train crashed. He
grabbed a ladder and helped the injured to safety. He stood by as
rescuers pulled a 10-year-old girl from the wreckage alive.
	   Color Sergeant Phil Forsyth and 20 soldiers from the 2nd
Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, based at Celle in Germany, were
among the first to arrive at the site.
	   Sgt Forsyth, speaking in a BBC interview from the regiment's
base just minutes from the crash scene, said: ``On arrival we were
met by an horrific site.
	   ``Some five or six carriages were piled up on top of each other.
Once we got nearer it became quite clear the bridge had totally
collapsed on to the second and third carriages, and the remainder
of the carriages had piled up on top of that.
	   ``All the carriages were absolutely mangled; it was a mess and
very sad to see.
	   ``My heart can do nothing but go out to those people who were
caught up in it and those who were waiting to find out what had
happened.''
	   Sgt Forsyth, who has been in the Army for 13 years and fought in
the Persian Gulf war, added: ``It is definitely one of the worst
scenes I have ever seen, if not the worst.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The city administration stopped collecting 22
levies on 31 different types of municipality service as of May 23.
	   The decision was taken in line with Jakarta Governor's Decree
No. 134/1998 and Law No. 18/1997 on the collection of local taxes
and levies.
	   The abolished levies include fees charged for civil
registration, disturbance regulation, citizenship, fire,
sanitation, funeral services and sidewalk businesses.
	   The decree also states that city residents should only be
subject to a fee of Rp 1,000 to process identification cards.
	   When asked what the impact of the move on city revenues would
be, City Hall spokesman Kamaludin S. refused to comment.
	   However, Governor Sutiyoso said in March that locally generated
revenues in the 1998/1999 fiscal year were expected to fall 15.86
percent to Rp 1.72 trillion. Before the monetary crisis broke, an
estimated Rp 2.03 trillion was expected to be raised from local
levies.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The city will soon change the use of Timor and
Humpuss buildings belonging to former president Soeharto's son
Hutomo Mandala Putra on Jl. Medan Merdeka Timur, Central Jakarta,
for social services because their construction violated existing
land-use regulations.
	   Central Jakarta Mayor Andi Subur Abdullah said yesterday that
according to Presidential Decree No. 25/1995 on the development of
the Medan Merdeka area, private companies were forbidden from
building offices along nearby streets.
	   The streets covered by the decree include Jl. Medan Merdeka
Barat, Jl. Medan Merdeka Timur, Jl. Medan Merdeka Selatan and Jl.
Medan Merdeka Utara. The streets are designed to be buffer zones
for the Medan Merdeka park, where the National Monument (Monas)
stands.
	   ``We are about to change the use of the two high-rise buildings
into places for social services,'' he said.
	   When asked what types of social services would be offered at the
sites, Andi said: ``We haven't decided it yet.''
	   On top of prohibiting private companies from establishing office
buildings, the decree also stipulates that buildings in the area
should not be higher than the National Monument.
	   Numerous government buildings, including presidential and
ministerial offices as well as the American Embassy, are located on
the streets.
	   Asked about the possibilities that the building owners pay
penalties for the violation, Andi said he would study the matter
first.
	   ``We haven't gone that far,'' he said.
	   Andi also said he was looking into projects closely related to
Soeharto's family in the mayoralty.
	   ``We'll study the projects' legal basis first before taking
action against their owners,'' he said.
	   Andi also insisted that the mayoralty would continue the
beautification of the Monas area.
	   Commenting on the opposition to the beautification project from
street vendors forced by the project to relocate to a site further
from the Monas area, the mayor said he would urge them to abide by
the existing order.
	   ``I've repeatedly asked the administration to provide proper
lighting at the relocation site to help attract the vendors, but up
to now there has been no response,'' he said.
	   Many of the vendors who were told to relocate to the new site
have reoccupied their former selling spots, including the
monument's gateway where visitors of the park enter.
	   The vendors strongly rejected the relocation plan because it
significantly reduced their daily incomes.

<TEXT>
	   THE Asean Gas Pipeline Grid - mooted in 1988 - is now expected
to be ready only in 2016 as the region's economic problems have
caused work on some of the key components to be deferred.
	   This projection was made by Petronas vice-president for gas
business Muri Muhammad at the 3rd Asia Oil  Gas Conference in
Kuala Lumpur. The two-day conference ended yesterday.
	   While the impact of the Asian economic problems on the Asean Gas
Pipeline Grid is still a major concern, ``... it is foreseen that
the pipeline development will be temporarily delayed rather than
altogether halted''.
	   Muri said despite the economic problems, work on several
components for the Asean project was continuing as scheduled. The
gas grid will eventually link up Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore,
Indonesia, Brunei as well as the Philippines.
	   Malaysia's Peninsular Gas Utilisation system - due for
completion later this year - has the potential to become the
backbone of the gas grid, he added.
	   ``Nevertheless the development of one of the most important link
of the Asean Gas Pipeline Grid which is the Natuna gas pipeline to
Thailand has been postponed due to massive budget cuts.''
	   ``The postponement of the Natuna development has also caused the
delay on the work of the Trans-Java pipeline which will source gas
from Natuna field (located in the Gulf of Thailand) for the
Javanese gas market.''
	   Touching on the demand for natural gas, Muri said demand for the
energy resource is projected to grow at 3.7 per cent annually
worldwide until 2005 compared with 2.3 per cent per annum for oil
and two per cent annually for coal.
	   ``Within Asia-Pacific, natural gas accounted for 9.2 per cent of
the primary energy used in 1996. In 1996, 11 per cent of the world
gas demand came from the Asia-Pacific region.''
	   In 1996, Asia-Pacific countries consumed nearly eight trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, double the demand in 1986. A large
portion of natural gas is used for generating electricity.

Plane crash kills seven in northern Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A single-engine air taxi flying through smoky
skies crashed in the mountains of northern Mexico, killing seven
people, Durango state officials said Wednesday.
	   ``According to the reports we have, there was null visibility
because of smoke... caused by fires,'' said Durango state's
communications director, Hector Partida.
	   The Cessna 206 was approaching a landing field in Topia, about
55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of its base in the western city
of Culiacan, when it crashed at 1:50 p.m. on Tuesday, Partida said.
	   The victims were identified as pilot Manuel Herrera, his son
Manuel Herrera, attorney Pascual Estevez Guzman and his sister
Magda, 22, Juana Gutierrez and two children, aged 13 and 14.
	   Many parts of the rugged mountain zone have no access by highway
and air taxis are a common method of transportation.
	   ``The pilots in this case ... have a lot of experience in flying
in that part of the Sierra,'' Partida said.

Volkswagen, Porsche to team up on sports utility vehicle 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Taking aim at a market long dominated
by U.S. car manufacturers, Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG of Germany
are teaming up to build a sports utility vehicle.
	   The two automakers, in a joint statement released Wednesday,
said they hope to launch the new vehicle in the year 2002.
	   Each company will sell its the vehicles under its own name.
Porsche will oversee the development of the vehicle, while
Volkswagen will be in charge of producing it. The companies expect
annual sales of about 100,000 vehicles.
	   Company officials said they were optimistic about entering the
sports utility market, one of the hottest segments of the auto
industry.
	   ``Our new sports utility vehicle will tap new growth
potential,'' Porsche Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking said. ``It will
also limit our dependency on the traditional market segments of
sports cars, convertibles and roadsters.''
	   Robert Buechelhofer, VW board member and in charge of marketing
and sales, said: ``This car targets an extremely dynamic segment _
there is no other area which grows faster than sports utility
vehicles.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Several prominent artists and art students
demanded yesterday the immediate dismissal of Salim Said and other
members of the Jakarta Arts Council (DKJ), as well as the Jakarta
Academy of Arts and Culture (AJ), the board which elects DKJ
members.
	   They made the demand in a meeting organized by DKJ at Taman
Ismail Marzuki art center in Central Jakarta, to discuss reforms
within the arts and cultural community.
	   Poet and writer Sitok Srengenge read the written statements
which contained demands for reform at local and national levels.
	   ``Free the arts from licenses to perform, bureaucracy,
censorship and banning of plays, exhibitions and general
performances,'' Sitok said.
	   This included the freeing of art centers from bureaucratic red
tape and the rebuilding of art councils and cultural centers in all
provinces.
	   At a local level, artists and students ``advised with full
respect for the recently elected DKJ board for the 1998/1999 period
to declare its self-dismissal.''
	   They demanded a new electoral voting system to select members of
the DKJ board that required the city's artists to vote and was free
of the governor's influence.
	   DKJ head Salim Said, recently reappointed for a third three-year
term, faced most of the heat in silence.
	   The observer of military affairs told The Jakarta Post that the
board members just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
	   ``They (the artists and students) were holding a monolog,''
Salim said.
	   ``It was useless for us to tell them that we were the ones who
allocated funds outside the meager funding of Rp 1 billion
(US$85,500) for DKJ's six arts and culture committees by the
National Development Planning Board and the city administration,''
he said.
	   ``They are just excited about the downfall of Soeharto ... they
don't realize that without us, neither Ratna Sarumpaet's play nor
Emha Ainun Najib's show would have been staged here.''
	   Ratna Sarumpaet's play Marsinah Menggugat (Marsinah Accuses) was
staged at TIM and several other places before it was banned in some
cities.
	   Salim said that a general meeting of the DKJ board members would
be held Friday to discuss further the possibilities of reform
within the arts community and dismissal of the DKJ board.
	   Salim added that the dismissal of the board was a matter to be
decided by the board members themselves.
	   ``They talked. We respected them and kept silent. But the
dismissal of the board will be done on our terms and our's alone,''
Salim said.
	   Ratna Riantiarno, organizer of Teater Koma and DKJ member,
stressed that despite a 1970 gubernatorial decree making the AJ
appointees lifetime members of the body that elects the DKJ, the
dismissal of the AJ board was only a matter of time.

	   DESPITE the economic downturn, National Panasonic (Malaysia) Sdn
Bhd still hopes to maintain its record-breaking sales performance
for the current financial year.
	   To this end managing director Bunroku Morioka said the company
would maximise its efforts to match the RM1 billion in sales that
it had achieved in the last two years.
	   The company broke its own record when it chalked up RM1 billion
in sales in 1996, up 103 per cent from the previous year, and kept
the momentum going the last financial year notching sales of RM1.05
billion.
	   Morioka, however, acknowledges the economic scenario has changed
dramatically since then.
	   ``Sometimes, no matter how hard you swim against the current,
the forces may be stronger so you have to be humble. Our market is
estimated to be down between 15 and 20 per cent, but we would still
like to maintain our sales,'' he told reporters after a visit to
Balai Berita yesterday.
	   ``That is why we are not reducing our advertising and promotions
budget.
	   We will do our best.''
	   When asked how Japan's own economic troubles were affecting the
company's operations, Morioka said the impact was not significant.
	   Corporate losses have been mounting in Japan as the yen slides
against the US dollar.
	   ``We are lucky, we buy a lot of our goods locally. The yen is
down but so is the ringgit, so the impact is small overall,'' he
said, adding National Panasonic products now had an average 70 per
cent local content.
	   Morioka noted that the Malaysian home appliance market was
unusual as, besides Japan, it was the only country that was
receptive to innovative and high-tech products.
	   ``There is a very high standard of living here and consumers are
very quality conscious, so they are willing to use products that
improve their lifestyle.
	   ``Elsewhere, even in the United States, home appliances are
relatively low-tech and the same ones stay in the market for
years,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted he
wasn't looking for handouts following a meeting Wednesday with
French President Jacques Chirac.
	   After arriving in Paris at the start of a two-day visit _ his
first overseas trip since becoming Prime Minister in April _
Kiriyenko twice told reporters an economic rescue package was not
on his agenda.
	   ``Neither on the official program nor outside the official
program is that (aid) a question,'' Kiriyenko said after his
meeting at the Elysee Palace with Chirac.
	   A small man in a blue suit who at times appeared lost among the
delegation of husky Russian businessmen and bodyguards who
accompanied him, Kiriyenko nevertheless projected confidence.
	   For his part, Chirac told Kiriyenko that he had ``confidence in
Russia's capacity to carry out its reform policies,'' presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   Chirac urged Kiriyenko to improve tax collection, create a
modern and transparent banking system as well as a judicial and
fiscal framework for business, Colonna told reporters.
	   Russia's dismal record in collecting taxes has left the
government with a huge fiscal hole, enormous debts, an inability to
pay state workers and is at the heart of the current crisis.
	   The ongoing Russian financial crisis has fueled speculation that
some kind of aid package from the world's leading industrialized
nation may be needed, primarily to prevent a collapse of the ruble.
	   Kiriyenko did say ``relations between G-7 countries and Russia
have reached a new stage.'' He didn't elaborate but said it is
vital for the European Union to open its markets to Russian goods.
	   Finance officials from the G-7 are to meet in Paris next week,
with the slump in the yen against the dollar and Russia's economic
troubles among the issues high on their agenda.
	   Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport, Kiriyenko
said Russia must further integrate into the world economy in order
to be able to better withstand financial shock waves like those
that have shaken Asia and Russia itself recently.
	   The Russian stock market has fallen about 50 percent from the
beginning of 1998, a dramatic change from the previous year's
record growth of 98 percent.
	   ``We should be more integrated in the industrial process and the
entire array of economic relations with other countries,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   In addition to Chirac, Kiriyenko was to meet with Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and leading French lawmakers and businessmen.
	   France is a modest trading partner, just eighth among Western
European nations, and Russia would like to increase ties with
aerospace, nuclear and automobile manufacturers.
	   However, France traditionally enjoys good political relations
with Russia and could be expected to support an eventual economic
aid package.

	   The name NITCO has stood out as the pioneer in the manufacture
of high quality ceramic and mosaic tiles and has been in the
forefront in the matter of supplying building materials such as
flooring tiles, exterior paints etc. NITCO TILES is a part of the
reputed NITCO GROUP, which was established in 1953. With an
unsurpassed track record of more than four decades, the group has
grown to be an acknowledged manufacturer and exporter of quality
tiles in India, with a combined production of approximately 40
million square feet per annum of mosaic and ceramic floor
tiles.Ceramic floor tiles are manufactured in the most up-to-date,
state-of-the-art automatic Plant at Alibaug in Maharashtra.
	   The Plant, Machinery and Technical Support are provided by the
world-renowned SACMI of Italy. Production commenced in March 1997
and within a short span of 12 months, the NITCO Ceramic tiles brand
has achieved a lion's share of the Indian market on the basis of
consistent quality and service.The group has identified exports as
a major thrust area and aggressive efforts are on to promote the
product in overseas markets. Distribution arrangements have already
been finalised in South Africa and the Middle East and the process
of finalisation in other markets is in progress.
	   Nitco Tiles is the only Indian Ceramic tile manufacturing
company to have participated in international trade shows like
Cevisama' in Spain and Coverings' in USA which has given the group
an opening into the demanding markets of USA and Europe.The Ceramic
floor tiles conform to European standards EN-87 Group BLLA EN-177.
With a manufacturing capacity of 10,000 sq mtrs a day, and a large
network of local dealers throughout India, NITCO will soon become a

country just as it has an enviable position in the mosaic tiles
industry. The present trend indicates that it has already been
warmly accepted in the Indian and overseas markets.Nitco is the
only group in India that has set up manufacturing plants as well as
exported technical know-how to several countries in the world in
the field of floor tile manufacture.

of India. Each factory boasts of state-of-the-art machinery and
trained manpower for the production of tiles to suit a wide range
of requirements. The Nitco Group has an employee strength of about
1500 people. Nitco has also provided and transferred technical
know-how for the production of mosaic tiles to companies in the
Middle East and Nigeria. The Group registered a turnover in excess
of US$ 50 million in 1997-98.In recognition of its outstanding
export performance, Nitco has been the proud recipient of eleven
consecutive export awards from the Government of India. Nitco has

conducted tests in five tile factories to incorporate certain
changes in the BIS specification. Of these five, three were from
the Nitco Group. Nitco Delhi, NITCO Bombay and NITCO Bangalore.The
Nitco Group's ethos has always been to provide high quality
products, customer satisfaction and constant innovation and

	   SURABAYA (JP): Hundreds of students marched yesterday afternoon
to the private SCTV television station here demanding their
demonstration for reform be broadcast and refused to budge until
the station managers yielded.
	   Traveling in two big buses and other personal vehicles, the
students first went to the state-owned TVRI television station but
were prevented from entering. They then went to SCTV, which is
located nearby in the Darmo Permai housing complex.
	   While several of their leaders negotiated with station manager
Ris Anggono, the other students from, among others, Petra Christian
University, Wijaya Kusuma University and Surabaya Teachers'
Training Institute, held a free-speech forum under the watchful
eyes of security personnel.
	   One of the students, Sapardi, said their demand to be broadcast
was meant to help disseminate the students' call for total reform.
	   The students defined reform as including the revocation of the
five laws that govern the country's political system, and revision
of the Armed Forces' dual function that enables the military to be
not only security forces but also a political player.
	   They also demanded the revocation of the subversion law, the
release of political prisoners, general elections, the lowering of
prices of essential goods, and an investigation into alleged
corruption by officials.
	   SCTV finally agreed to air the student demonstration on its 6
p.m. news bulletin yesterday.
	   The students' move echoed that of another group of student
protesters who last month took over the RRI radio station and
broadcast a protest against former president Soeharto.
	   Yesterday's demonstration called for the convening of a special
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to elect a new
president and for Soeharto to be tried for corruption.
	   The same demands were made by another group of students who
staged a rally at the East Java provincial legislative council.
They demanded the local legislators endorse their call for the MPR
special session.
	   In Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, 200 students from the
Medan Teacher Training Institute continued with their
demonstrations.
	   They marched to the provincial police headquarters and demanded
to meet police chief Brig. Gen. Sutyono to discuss the alleged
sexual harassment committed by his men toward female student
protesters last month.
	   The students failed to meet with the police chief.
	   Officials
	   Also yesterday, demonstrations were held by students and other
groups against certain officials they considered to be corrupt.
	   At the Ministry of Education and Culture office, staff members
demanded the resignation of Director for Vocational Senior High
Schools Jorlin Pakpahan for allegedly ``cultivating practices of
corruption, collusion and nepotism'' at the ministry.
	   Antara reported that yesterday's was the second protest held by
the same group of civil servants; the first was held last week
during the transfer of duty from outgoing minister Wiranto
Arismunandar to Juwono Sudarsono.
	   Then, the staff members demanded that the new minister fight the
rampant corruption and collusion prevalent in the education
ministry.
	   In Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, 25 students continued
their sit-in at the provincial legislative council and claimed they
would not budge until State Minister of Agrarian Affairs Hasan
Basri Durin resigned because of alleged corruption.
	   Yesterday's was the students' fifth day at the complex.
Supporters have been supplying the student protesters with food.
	   Basri Durin is the former West Sumatra governor.
	   Intervention
	   Also yesterday, two groups of students demonstrated in Surabaya
and Jakarta against what they called the United States' meddling in
Indonesia's internal affairs. Seventy Jakartan students rallied
outside the U.S. Embassy in Central Jakarta, while 200 colleagues
marched to the U.S. consulate on Jl. Dr. Soetomo in the East Java
capital.
	   Both demonstrations passed without incident after delegations
were received.
	   In Jakarta, protesters calling themselves the Defenders Front
for National Sovereignty criticized U.S. aid to local Indonesian
groups.
	   ``We reject all types of American intervention and condemn those
sons and daughters of the nation who have already become the
stooges of America,'' the group said in a statement.
	   The Surabaya protest, by the unknown Indonesian Saviors Forum,
also criticized the reported presence of a number of U.S. naval
ships close to Indonesia during last month's political turmoil and
violence.

	   WORLD oil prices are expected to pick up through another round
of production cutbacks by members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to check the current excess supply which has
pushed prices down in recent months, British Petroleum Plc chief
economist Professor Peter Davies said yesterday.
	   He expected the Opec summit meeting on June 24 to agree on
further cutbacks in production to allow prices to recover from a 30
per cent fall since last November.
	   With production outstripping world consumption, Davies said Asia
had also experienced lower oil consumption since financial problems
hit the region last year.
	   Current Asian oil consumption stands at about 200,000 barrels a
day, down from about 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day experienced
before the onset of the financial problems.
	   However, Davies said oil consumption in any country slowed to a
lesser extent in tandem with economic growth. He was confident that
Asian oil consumption would pick up again in the near future with
the recovery of emerging Asian economies.
	   ``For Asian oil consumption, we saw the worst during the first
quarter of this year and it will pick up again as the region shows
good economic fundamentals.
	   ``For oil prices, there is no reason to believe it will stay
down as we expect more cutbacks in world production after the Opec
meeting,'' he told newsmen in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Current world oil production stands at about 75 million bpd
resulting in a daily surplus of one million barrels while prices
per barrel since last November have fallen to about US$14 (RM54.60)
from US$20.
	   ``Many oil producers do not want to add on to their already
rapidly rising stocks. We can expect further cutbacks after the
Opec meeting but the issue is by how much,'' Davies said.

	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The chief doctor of the French
team called for blood doping tests in soccer as quickly as possible
to counter any spread of the use of the EPO drug at the World Cup.
	   ``The risk of doping exists. EPO can be of help during the
preparations of a World Cup,'' French team doctor Jean-Marcel
Ferret said.
	   The drug EPO, a synthetic form of the hormone erythropoietin, is
considered the +drug+ of choice in endurance sports because it
allows the blood to stock oxygen. Several deaths of athletes have
already been linked to EPO.
	   ``I'm 100 percent in favor of blood testing in soccer, just like
in cycling,'' Ferret said.
	   There will be no such tests during the World Cup competition
that opens June 10.
	   EPO has its most beneficial effects in endurance sports. But
because of the fatigue on World Cup player during the month-long
World Cup, the drug could prupotedly also have advantages there.
	   ``So far, doping remains anecdotal in soccer,'' said Ferret.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a high-level meeting of the
Communications Ministry stressed the paramount importance of
improving the roads and railways infrastructure of the nation, and
directed the Ministry officials to speedily implement the ongoing
projects in that sector, for the sake of national development. She
asked the Railway authorities to attend to the needs of commuters
from suburbs to the city for taking traffic loads off the roads,
and at the same time instructed the Roads and Highways authorities
to undertake construction of by-passes and fly-overs to relieve
traffic jam in the metropolis.
	   Indeed as Dhaka city is rapidly growing, the inner-city road
network along with parking space for motorised and non-motorised
traffic taken together is proving critically inadequate. There is
very little room for expansion of individual modes of transport.
Unless bulk transport facilities are increased, not only suburban
commuters but also inner-city residents will find it increasingly
difficult to move from one part to another, and time wasted on
roads will be prohibitive for the working population in the
city.While by-passes and fly-overs could ease the traffic pressures
at same road-junctions, the inevitable growth of private vehicles,
rickshaws and autorickshaws is bound to create traffic troubles on
roads like in Bangkok.
	   The government has taken a wise decision by sanctioning import
of 200 double-decker buses for bulk-carriage, 40 of which have
arrived already. A more efficient and environment-friendly mode of
bulk transportation could be a metropolitan inner-city and suburban
train network. On hindsight, the railway tracks that have been
turned into roads as the Fulbaria Station moved to Kamalapur ought
to have been retained by the Railways for a possible role in
inner-city traffic. Even a circular railway around the periphery of
the inner-city could be of immense help in relieving transportation
burden.Indeed the Railway offers the best mode of
bulk-transportation in a least-developed country like ours. It is a
pity that since independence, we have not added to our railway
tracks, and indeed may have lost some to slum-encroachments on
sparsely used or unused railway property.
	   As a result, the improvement that we enjoy in faster inter-city
trains takes a toll of the regular passage of many district trains
using the same tracks. What is needed is a more comprehensive
planning and investment for an all-embracing railway network.

No oil production cuts in Kazakstan despite lower prices metric tons 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT estimated production of 25-26 million
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan does not plan to cut oil production,
despite the fall in world oil prices, the president of the
Kazakhoil national oil company said Wednesday.
	   Nurlan Kapparov told the Interfax news agency in Kazakstan that
it would not be profitable to close wells, because reopening them
would entail huge expenses.
	   ``Even if a well is not unprofitable, it would be better left in
production,'' he said.
	   Kapparov said the government considered reducing excise duties
or taking other measures to help oil companies, but ``budget
possibilities are limited'' in the Central Asian country.
	   Kazakstan expects to extract 25 million to 26 million metric
tons (172 million to 182 million barrels) of oil this year,
Kapparov said.
	   Kapparov also said that the Tengizchevroil joint venture _ in
which Chevron has a 45-percent stake and Mobil 25 percent _ plans
to increase oil production this year.

Stanchart leads way in smart cards, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

<TEXT>
	   ELECTRONIC commerce and smart cards, while not new to the man in
the street, had only a minimal impact on everyday life in the form
of a telephone card or the SIM card in cellular phones.
	   Their use so far has been limited because the smart card is
vendor or issuer-dependent and is inflexible and expensive.
	   As a result, users still have to carry numerous cards in their
wallets from different issuers for different purposes such as for a
department store's shopping loyalty programme.
	   This is about to change.
	   In a move that sets a standard for the use of smart cards in
payment technology, Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore yesterday
launched the world's first Visa open platform smart card based on
Java technology. And it is set to propel e-commerce even further.
	   The launch, a joint effort with the bank's business partners -
Visa International, Sun Microsystems and Gemplus - was done by
Singapore Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu.
	   The Visa open platform is non-proprietary, thus allowing the
card to work anywhere in the world and card issuers to have total
independence in choosing a smart card vendor.
	   At the same time, use of the Java programming language allows
banks to mix and match applications and to customise their services
to meet the demands of different customers.
	   Most of all, the versatile Java-based open platform addresses
the critical issue of upgrades by ensuring that infrastructure
investments made yesterday and today will continue to work with
emerging systems tomorrow.
	   Standard Chartered head of chip and debit card services
(consumer banking) Nicholas Fung said the benefits to banks were
huge as the chip allows them the flexibility to customise products
and services offered to customers.
	   It gives greater security, improves risk management by
preventing unauthorised tampering of data, allows for updates to
the functions of the cards and overall increased efficiency with
reduced costs.
	   To consumers, the Standard Chartered smart card offers
convenience, flexibility, and security for their virtual shopping
needs.
	   Customers can also choose what products and services to put on
the card before or after issue. This means fewer cards to carry and
more value-added services.
	   Fung said Standard Chartered planned to have at least 100 kiosks
or sites in Singapore by the end of the year where users could shop
using the smart card.
	   Fung said the bank was waiting for Bank Negara and the Malaysian
Government to issue directives and guidelines on the use of the
card.

	   BLUE-CHIP stocks edged higher on Monday, but technology shares
took another drubbing as the delay of the new Intel chip compounded
worries about the impact of a weak Asian economy on computer
industry profits.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.42 points - or 0.25 per
cent - to 8,922.37 after retreating from an 81-point advance to
within 20 points of 9,000.
	   Broader indexes fell, with the technology-laden Nasdaq composite
plunging nearly two per cent as the recent exodus from big
computer-related names picked up steam.
	   The Dow, which sank 215 points last week as the overseas
backdrop took another turn for the worse, briefly dipped into
negative territory late in the session.
	   Intel's shares tumbled nearly five per cent while Dell Computer,
Microsoft and Applied Materials fell sharply as the three most
active Nasdaq issues after Intel.
	   The Nasdaq composite, tumbled about 170 points, or nearly nine
per cent, since setting a closing record of 1,917.61 on April 22.
	   Other broad-market indexes turned negative after posting modest
gains for most of the session.

	   The violence unleashed against those who resist toll collectors
has taken an even more disturbing trend. Last Monday morning as
reported in the media, three boys aged 12 to 15, gunned down a
garments factory supplier in broad daylight. What is of grave
concern about this particular incident is the involvement of
juveniles in street crimes. This trend needs to be nipped
immediately and our misguided juveniles restored to normalcy.
Recreational opportunities are not lacking. In fact, the juveniles
may be suffering from a surfeit.
	   What is required is character-building activity.Incidentally, in
the recent past it is mostly young entrepreneurs who have been
killed by toll collectors for refusing to pay up. Perhaps these
budding businessmen felt that part of what they earn by the sweat
of their brow should not go into the hands of those who do no
labour. Others, however, take threats more seriously and regard
toll payment as just another incidental expense in running a
business. It is not the acquiescence of these silent majority of
businessmen which is giving indulgence and emboldening the toll
collectors but the protective umbrella of those who exercise their
influence from behind the scenes. If a culprit is booked, a
cumbersome procedure will probably be initiated, serving neither
the ends of justice nor having any deterrent effect on those
stalking the streets with deadly weapons.
	   The law seems to have its hands tied. Politicians - of all hues
- who can make the first and definite move, do not appear to be
concerned. Ultimately, it is the citizens that must gird themselves
to squash the toll collecting menace and similar activities by
being actively vocal. A beginning has been made in Chittagong,
which has been most hard hit by lawlessness. If the Chittagong and
similar movements are to reap any harvest, the hand of the law
needs to be empowered as is the norm in countries where crime has
been kept at bay. We cannot bestow responsibility divested of the
necessary quantum of authority to the law enforcement agency and
expect desired results. To ensure peace and order the power to
implement needs to be present.

Generali, Israel's Holocaust museum begin computerizing names of victims 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Italian insurance company being sued for
failing to payout thousands of policies of Holocaust victims, began
assisting Israel Wednesday in computer archiving details of war
victims.
	   Last week, Assicurazioni Generali provided Yad Vashem, Israel's
national Holocaust museum with a computerized list of 300,000 names
of Jewish and non-Jewish policy holders they insured between
1920-1945 in eastern and central Europe. Yad Vashem will sort
through the list to identify Jewish victims.
	   ``For us, the documentation of names is of vital importance,''
said Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev. Six million Jews were killed
in the Nazi Holocaust and some 300,000 survivors live in the Jewish
state founded after the war.
	   Wednesday Generali and Yad Vashem began a joint task force to
upgrade means for locating Holocaust victims' names and set up a
computerized repository which will include archives from Yad Vashem
and other world archives.
	   ``The working relationship between Yad Vashem and Generali
result from the very tragic period in Jewish history,'' said Guido
Pastori, vice-president of Generali, in a press statement.
	   ``I am grateful that Generali has the opportunity to support and
to be involved in the efforts made by Yad Vashem to perpetuate the
legacy of the Holocaust all over the world,'' Pastori said.
	   Generali, founded by Italian Jews in 1831, has said it is not
liable for the unpaid policies because many of its offices were
taken over by communists after World War II. The company was sued
last year along with 15 other insurers, in federal court in New
York. Another suit was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior
Court by family members of Holocaust victims.
	   The state of California is investigating Generali records
relating to Holocaust victims and has threatened to ban the company
and other insurance carriers if they fail to honor the old claims.
	   Israel has also made similar threats to boycott Generali, based
in Trieste, Italy, and its Israeli subsidiary, Migdal Insurance
which was founded in the 1930s.
	   But Jewish leaders have praised Generali for keeping commitments
such as gathering the long list of World War II claimants.
	   Generali has expressed support for an international commission
to investigate claims by victims and their families.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund which is
to be distribute with discretion to beneficiaries or families of
insured victims. The fund is managed by a board of trustees and
chaired by a retired justice of Israel's Supreme Court.

	   Although words like legend' are apt to be misused on sentimental
occasions like this one, Brojen Das indeed created a legend in his
small field - swimming. Back in the fifties he had put this poor
country on the world map of swimming.As the first Asian to cross
the English Channel, he gave a new pride to the people of this
country. He crossed the Channel faster than his Egyptian
predecessor Abdur Rahman had done. And it was not just one chance
achievement; he was totally dedicated to swimming and brought many
more credits to Bangladesh in the field of this aquatic sport.
	   He set new record in crossing time and crossed the Channel six
times, making a daunting athletic event look like an everyday
affair. The icy and fierce waters of the English Channel seemed as
natural to him as the hard and bouncy turf to an experienced
cricketer. Brojen Das was our star swimmer who gave international
dimension to a sport which had hitherto been a local
activity.Brojen Das has left us. The athletic world has been sadly
diminished by his passing at a nursing home in Calcutta.
	   We owe it to our national legacy not to let this hero of the
athletic world depart unsung. Both President Justice Shahabuddin
Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have mourned Brojen Das'
death. The country can befittingly honour him by giving swimming a
rigorous thrust in the country's sporting perspective. Although
this riverine land has produced star swimmers, swimming is not our
national passion. Opportunity for swimming has also shrunk greatly
in recent years, especially in urban areas. As swimming is becoming
more internationally competitive, we need to be inspired all the
more with the work and vision of pioneers like Brojen Das.

	   IN the wake of the regional economic slowdown, local companies
are being forced to hone their skills to survive.
	   Most have introduced pay cuts among senior management while some
are retrenching staff.
	   At the start of the problem late last year, national car maker
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd scaled down production in tandem
with the slowdown in demand.
	   However, the slowdown did not stop Proton from continuing to
plough back its earnings into research and development which the
company considers important in ensuring a competitive edge in the
global market.
	   Vice-chairman for strategy and operations Tengku Mahaleel Tengku
Ariff said Proton invested RM460 million on its RD this year
despite the downturn.
	   ``I believe we must continue to invest in RD to prepare
ourselves for the recovery. The business of car-making involves
long-term planning, even developing a prototype takes a lot of
manpower and funds,'' he said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He was addressing a group of top-level public relations officers
at a forum on ``Managing for survival in a crisis'' organised by
the International Association of Business Communicators.
	   Tengku Mahaleel said at Proton, he spent a lot of time on
dialogues with his staff, a practice which he introduced when he
joined the company in 1996.
	   ``I have always made it a point to listen to their views and
problems.
	   These days, whenever I meet them, their main concern is whether
they will be retrenched.
	   ``And I assure them that will not be Proton's option. Once they
know this, they can concentrate on their work without worrying
about losing their jobs.
	   ``And because we conduct this dialogue at every level once a
week, the staff are kept up-to-date on the happenings in the
company. Therefore, they are more willing to make small sacrifices
such as a cut in overtime,''
	   Tengku Mahaleel.
	   He said at Proton, ``we don't like to retrench because it takes
such a long time and effort to train someone new to acquire a
skill. We'd rather keep the ones that we have.''
	   Apart from dialogue, Tengku Mahaleel said he also called up
dealers and suppliers for their feedback.
	   ``We try to assist them in whatever way we can. For instance,
some of them are unable to hold their stock (of auto parts), which
can cost up to RM30 million a month. We buy it off them to help
them keep their business going,'' he added.
	   Another speaker, Lester Technology Group chief executive officer
Jerry Wu said he also believed in an open line between top
management and workers.
	   ``One always hears of company heads who say that their people
are the company's greatest asset.
	   ``I really believe in that because if a worker is unclear about
the company's goals or does not know what is happening with the
rest of the company's operations other than his job specification,
than we can't expect them to work hard for the company,'' Wu said.
	   According to Wu, the economic situation had made the company,
which provides total Internet and Intranet security solutions, more
resilient.
	   ``As a relatively new company, we started off our operations on
a Titanic mode. It's like we either swim or sink,'' Wu added.
	   Paddy Schubert Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk Paddy Bowie said
in the wake of the slowdown, she believed part of the country's
problem in restoring investor confidence was in ``issue
management''.
	   ``Perception does not have to be factual to be powerful.
Therefore, if we do not do a good job of getting the good stories
of the country out to foreign investors, they tend to believe the
negative news in the foreign media written by parachuting
journalists,'' she added.
	   Although the perception that the situation in Malaysia was as
bad as that in neighbouring Indonesia and Thailand was slowly
fading away, Schubert said more needed to be done to send a louder
message that ``Malaysia really has what it takes to come out of
this crisis''.

	   SHARE prices climbed 1.5 per cent yesterday but traders said the
market was merely covering positions after a sharp fall on Monday.
	   ``Dealer-led short covering emerged following Monday's
declines,'' said a broker at Universal Securities. ``But the buying
was technical, as there are no particularly positive factors to
buy.''
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rose 233.42 points to close at 15,554.45.
	   The broader Topix index of all first-section issues gained 16.27
points to 1,212.97, with an estimated 280 millon shares changing
hands on the major board against 331.1 million the previous day.
	   A Meiko Securities Co Ltd broker said: ``The buying seen on the
day was only in reaction to the declines seen yesterday, so the
buying slowed as share prices recouped most of yesterday's
declines.''
	   The gains were limited by falls on Asian markets, brokers said.
	   Government-backed funds helped the market retain its early gains
despite lacklustre trade, traders said.
	   Nikko Securities Co Ltd surged 36 yen, or 7.5 per cent, to 518
yen, following the previous day's announcement that US financial
giant Travelers Group will buy a 220 billion yen (RM6.27 billion)
stake in the broker.
	   Nikko was the most heavily traded stock, with 18 million shares
changing hands as investors scrambled to take advantage of the
expected boost to the broker's fortunes.

	   The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is one of the concrete
results of the UN Conference on Environment and Development held in
Rio in 1992. It still remains the only multilateral mechanism which
provides financial support for projects that aim to deal with some
of the most urgent global environmental problems facing humankind
today. There can, however, be no doubt the 21st century will have
to see such a facility built on new and more dynamic principles of
global environmental cooperation that the new century and new
millennium will demand.
	   Instead of aid being the principle underpinning this
cooperation, we will have to move towards sharing of the benefits
of common global property resources like the atmosphere and the
oceans, internalisation of environmental costs in the pricing of
internationally traded commodities and national liabilities for
international ecological damage built on the ``Polluter Pays''
principle. In 1972 Barbara Ward and Rene Dubos had told the
Stockholm Conference that there is only one Earth. The need to
share the earth equitably, peacefully and sustainably has never
been greater than now. Sooner or later multilateral financing
mechanisms will have to be built on new and emerging principles of
global international cooperation.
	   However, we do see GEF in its current shape and form as an
important step forward. Recognising the importance of GEF in
nudging the world towards a sustainable world, nongovernmental
organisations from various countries who make up the GEF-NGO
network have presented this assembly with a statement entitled The
GEF in the 21st Century: A Vision for Strengthening the Global
Environment Facility. The statement draws on the experience of NGOs
in interacting with GEF at many levels and makes several key
recommendations for strengthening and improving the performance of
GEF. First, the resolution of the issue we are dealing with is
going to be a very challenging task. Resolution of environmental
problems must take into account the related social, economic and
cultural issues as well.
	   Therefore, GEF must have a genuine learning culture. In order to
do this, the monitoring and the evaluation programme of GEF should
be strengthened, its institutional independence maintained, and
civil society groups ought to be involved in its work in a more
effective and sustainable manner. Second, GEF must do more to
ensure that global environmental concerns are integrated into the
non-GEF operations of its three implementing agencies (IAS). By
themselves, the resources of GEF are far too small to effect the
current development trajectory of the planet.
	   There should be periodic detailed reporting on the concrete
steps undertaken by IAS to mainstream the global environmental
objectives of GEF. Third, the number of IAS need to be expanded
beyond the existing three, to increase the involvement of NGOs and
community-based organisations. GEF should be a place where the best
project ideas and the most promising implementers with genuine
comparative advantage can compete. Fourth, GEF should become a
mechanism to catalyse and support better funding cooperation and
coordinating among multilateral and bilateral funding agencies and
supporting activities with global environmental objectives. A
funding-coordination-dialogue process for the global environment
should be started.
	   In addition, there is a need to evaluate in depth, which of the
various financing modalities used till now have been most effective
in order to understand which financing modalities should be given
higher priorities for the GEF programming, with the aim of
improving overall GEF effectiveness. Among the modalities that need
to be considered further are national environmental funds,
endowments and trusts, enterprise programmes, expansion of small
and medium grants, concessional or contingent loans to help start
projects with negative incremental costs, debt conversion options
and micro-credit programmes. A key message of the Rio conference
was the importance of civil society in sustainable development.
	   The key to sustainable development is building partnerships
--partnerships between the government, research institutions, the
private sector, NGOs and communities. GEF is focussing mainly on
government institutions and underemphasising the role of small or
local NGOs and community groups and the role of the small and
medium grants that are needed to support their activities. The role
of NGOs as a watchdog on GEF projects, specially where they have
negative social impacts, also needs to be appreciated, supported
and formalised, to the extent possible and necessary. But apart
from strengthening of GEF, there is a need to look beyond the
current narrow mandate of GEF. It is a sad fact that the post-Rio
period has seen a fragmentation of the global environmental agenda
rather than the development of a strong, well coordinated global
programme.
	   GEF as an institution should play a greater role in developing
an integrated global environmental agenda in the years to come. For
the South too, the challenge of environment is the challenge of
sustainable development. The world today is struggling to implement
two equally critical global action programmes, namely the Rio
agenda and the Copenhagen agenda. But each programme is following a
separate track. GEF cannot allow the global environment to become
an isolated issue. On the contrary, GEF should play a key role in
the integration of the Rio and the Copenhagen agendas.Many global
environmental issues like climate change, biodiversity-and
desertification, are deeply connected with the problem of global
-poverty.
	   In addition, there is need for greater synergy between the
programmes of different environment conventions. It is impossible
to de-link local environmental problems from global environmental
issues. When does biodiversity conservation stop being a local
environmental issue deeply connected with the livelihoods and
knowledge of innumerable, poor rural communities of the world and
when does it start becoming a global issue, is very difficult to
define.

	   STUDENTS of Sekolah Rendah Taman Megah, Petaling Jaya, rushed to
get a copy of the New Straits Times last week in the hope of
winning a prize in the Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Future Grads
Contest.
	   New Straits Times photographer S. Salim caught the scene of
students jostling to get the papers.
	   English teacher Kam Lee Bing said the school wanted to win a
computer by getting the whole school to participate.
	   ``The children enjoyed taking part in the competition,'' she
said. ``Some even used the Internet to get a more detailed answer
to the question of what El Nino stands for.''
	   The school has been using the New Straits Times as a learning
resource since last year under the Newspaper in Education
programme.
	   ``The extra copies that KL Mutual has sponsored means more
students can enter the contest,'' she said.
	   KL Mutual assistant marketing manager Chong Yuen Seng said:
``This is the first time we are going nationwide with the contest.
	   ``Last year, the Future Grads Contest was limited to the Klang
Valley because we had a smaller budget. This year, we will bring in
finalists from outside the Klang Valley at our expense.''
	   KL Mutual is spending RM250,000 to organise the contest. The
first round was from May 25 to 29.
	   Three hundred schools received 50 copies of the NST daily during
the contest.
	   Other schools who were keen on participating bought the
newspapers from the New Straits Times Press.
	   Each student could submit one entry, and it must be through his
school.
	   Three questions were published daily. Participants had to answer
a total of 15 questions and write a slogan on the importance of
saving.
	   Twelve finalists will be selected for the finals to be held at
the Subang Parade shopping complex in Subang Jaya on July 5.
	   The first prize is RM5,000, the second RM3,000, the third
RM2,000 and nine fourth prizes each worth RM1,000. All prizes will
be in the form of unit trust accounts.
	   There are also 50 consolation prizes.

European Union reaches out to its Mediterranean partners 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Cook, Kinkel quotes, EDITS to conform; TRIMS
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) - The European Union came together with its
Mediterranean partners Wednesday, trying to get the economic
cooperation process back on track after last year's derailment by
Mideast issues.
	   Despite the will to refocus on economics, however, the Middle
East peace process pushed its way onto the agenda of the 15 EU
foreign ministers and their 12 Mediterranean colleagues, and the
increasing violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo threatened to
do the same during the two-day meeting.
	   A year ago in Malta, the Euro-Mediterranean ministers tried to
talk trade and investment, only to see their meeting blown away by
the turbulent winds of the Mideast peace process.
	   ``We are all conscious that the political background of our work
here is the present deadlock in the Middle East peace process,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told his fellow ministers,
speaking for the presidency of the EU. Developing a prosperous
Euro-Mediterranean region, he said, can foster an atmosphere
conducive to peace.
	   Organizers hope the Palermo meeting, with no set agenda, will
bring the conference back to its original idea of creating a
European-Mediterranean free trade and security zone by the year
2010.
	   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of foreign affairs for the Palestine
Liberation Organization, was looking for a stronger European
position.
	   ``We want a clear statement which shows the Europeans stand in
support of the process of peace and expresses their willingness to
revive the process,'' he said. ``And they have to refer to those
who stand as a detriment to this process.''
	   Israel views the EU as pro-Arab and wants no significant role
for Europeans in the peace process beyond supplying funding.
	   ``France and Britain have supported Israel since its creation,''
Kaddoumi said. ``Now, they claim the Europeans are friends of the
Palestinians. I hope that is true ... and that they cut all
economic assistance to the Israelis.''
	   With violence on the rise in Kosovo, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Europe ``has to reconsider the entire picture.''
	   ``We certainly deplore the fact that there should be these
attacks ... contrary to the spirit of conciliation,'' Dini said.
NATO, he said, is studying the possibility of throwing up a
``shield'' of troops between Kosovo and its neighbors.
	   ``It has to be recognized that it is from the southern countries
that there is a flow of weapons into the area,'' he said.
	   Cook once again called on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic
``to halt the killing'' in Kosovo, while German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel called for ``stronger measures against Milosevic.''
	   If the escalation of violence continues, Kinkel said, ``then
there has to be a cutoff of investments, and the freezing of
Yugoslav money abroad has to be enforced.''
	   Joining ministers from the European Union are officials from
Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco,
Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority.

Jamaican leader gives plots of land to World Cup team 
</HEADLINE>
By CAROLL ORR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ No matter what their fortunes in this
month's World Cup playoffs, Jamaican national soccer team players
all will have plots of land to call home when they return to the
Caribbean.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson presented sales
agreements for parcels of land to each of the team's 22 players
Wednesday during an official send-off.
	   Called the Reggae Boyz, it is the first Jamaican team to win a
berth in the international competition, and the first from an
English-speaking Caribbean nation.
	   ``We have created history and excitement but we are going to
create even more history and excitement by what we achieve by our
performance in France,'' Patterson said. ``There are more miracles
yet to be revealed.''
	   He praised the players, their Brazilian coach Rene Simoes and
the Jamaica Football Federation, which turned the team from a
volunteer squad into a full-time professional team through heavy
marketing and sponsorships.
	   Patterson likened Simoes' dedication to that of Jesus Christ,
despite Simoes' announcement last month that he would leave the
team in October. He made the decision after a national newspaper
reported he was being paid dlrs 18,300 a month, more than any
Jamaican public official.
	   Simoes also has drawn criticism for replacing native-born
Jamaicans with players born in Britain to Jamaican parents.
	   ``Whatever our outcome, you have served us well,'' Patterson
told Simoes. ``We are proud of you and we can say no more than to
pay the highest tribute: to say that we see you as a true and
outstanding (honorary) Jamaican.''

Qualifier Romania struggles to beat Paraguay 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A penalty kick gave Romania a narrow
3-2 victory over Paraguay Wednesday in a warm-up game for the World
Cup in France.
	   The match was of particular importance for the Romanians as
their first game at the tournament is against Colombia whose play
is considered similar to that of Paraguay.
	   Romania's star player Gheorghe Hagi scored the winner in the
83rd minute from a penalty kick after Gheorghe Craioveanu
conveniently fell in the penalty area.
	   Although Romania looked more confident and controlled the game
most of the time, its defense had often problems with stopping
Paraguay's fast counterattacks.
	   The Romanians scored only four minutes after kickoff in
Bucharest's Steaua stadium.
	   It was Valencia's star Adrian Ilie, nicknamed ``Cobra'', who
scored from inside the penalty area with a ball centered from the
right by his future teammate Gabi Popescu.
	   Popescu was transferred last week from Salamanca to Valencia.
	   In the 27th minute, a Paraguayan counterattack found Jose
Cardozo free at 16 meters (yards) from the goal. Romanian
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea warded off his shot, but Cardozo scored on
the rebound.
	   Romania looked strong after change of sides, and in the 57th
minute, Hagi made brilliant use of a free kick from 25 meters by
serving Ilie who scored the second goal.
	   Only seven minutes later, Roberto Acuna beat the Romanian goalie
with a spectacular shot from about 20 meters in far-right position.
	   Paraguay also lost very good opportunity to take the lead in the
44th minute when Acuna fired from 30 meters (years) but hit the
crossbar.
	   In France, Romania plays in Group G together with England,
Colombia and Tunisia, while Paraguay meets in Group D Spain,
Bulgaria and Nigeria.
	   Lineups:
	   Romania: Bogdan Stelea, Constantin Galca, Dorinel Munteanu,
Cristian Dulca, Gheorghe Popescu, Iulian Filipescu, Dan Petrescu,
Gheorghe Hagi, Gabi Popescu, Adrian Ilie, Viorel Moldovan,
	   Paraguay: Jose Luis Chilavert, Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Catalino Rivarola, Roberto Acuna, Julio Cesar Enciso, Carlos
Paredes, Miguel Angel Benitez, Jose Cardozo, Pedro Sarabia, Cesar
Ramirez.

Iranian judges order retrials for journalist, German on death row 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Iran-German; ADDS retrial for journalist
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian judges have ordered retrials for a
German businessman and an Iranian journalist who were condemned to
death, state-run media reported Wednesday.
	   The retrials mean that the death sentences against Helmut Hofer,
a German businessman convicted of having sex with an Iranian woman,
and Morteza Firoozi, an Iranian journalist convicted of espionage
and adultery, have been set aside. New courts will issue their own
verdicts and, if necessary, sentences.
	   The chief justice's spokesman, Ali Abbassifard, said a new trial
had been ordered for Hofer because he contends he had converted to
Islam before the incident occurred, state-run radio reported. The
retrial has already started.
	   In the case of Firoozi, Abbassifard said the supreme court had
``major objections'' to his conviction, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   In January, an Iranian court sentenced Hofer, 54, to death after
convicting him of violating Iranian law by having sex with a
26-year-old medical student, who was Muslim while he was not.
	   The Bonn government warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed,
German-Iranian relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's
biggest trading partner in the Europe Union.
	   Last month, the chief justice, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, said
Hofer's case would be reviewed by the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court refused an appeal by Firoozi on May 10, the
Iran News reported.
	   Few details of Firoozi's case have emerged in the press, but
Yazdi said earlier this year that the journalist had been convicted
of spying and several sexual offenses. Adultery and espionage are
punishable by death under Iranian law.
	   Firoozi, 40, is a former editor of the Iran News. He has been
detained since May 1997.
	   While there is no evidence that the government has influenced
the decisions to retry Hofer and Firoozi, President Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate who took office in August, is known to favor
fewer death sentences than were carried out under previous
governments.

	   IF forests are removed, people cannot survive. This is the
opinion of French primatologist Marc Ancrenaz, who has been in and
out of Kinabatangan for the past four years with fellow researcher
and wife Isabelle.
	   ``Maybe they could fish, but with the removal of forests, even
fishing will become impossible,'' he says.
	   For Ancrenaz, the depleting forest is something that has to be
looked into on a long-term basis.
	   He feels that a management plan is needed because of rapid
changing habitats.
	   ``This is a natural resource. If we do not pay attention, it
will become extinct one day. Once a habitat is gone, it is gone
forever. There is no way to recreate it,'' he says.
	   And if nothing is done to preserve what the Kinabatangan has to
offer in terms of wildlife, we might not be able to see orang utans
in the next century.
	   Calamities such as droughts and fires affect the orang utan
population in the long term because they cannot settle down. This
will affect their reproduction.
	   The prolonged drought has made it difficult for orang utans to
find fruits and they have to move around a lot every day.
	   ``Parts of forests have been logged, leaving patches or pockets
of bare land. These orang utans then have to cross non-forested
land like oil palm plantations to seek food,'' he says.
	   According to Ancrenaz, orang utans eat young oil palm shoots
which are not more than three years old when they enter
plantations.
	   Estate owners then call the Wildlife Department to catch these
orang utans so that they can be sent to the Sepilok Orang Utan
Sanctuary in Sandakan.
	   If more land is cleared for timber and oil palm plantations, the
future of orang utans and other wildlife is going to become even
bleaker.
	   Driving through Labuk Road and then the road leading to Kota
Kinabatangan, one could see oil palm plantations stretching into
the horizon on both sides of the road. Patches of forested timber
land could also be seen.
	   ``Find a way to exploit timber in a wise way because the
Kinabatangan floodplain is one of the richest eco-systems in the
world,'' says Ancrenaz.
	   World Wide Fund for Nature scientific officer Reza Azmi says
there is a high density of orang utans in Kinabatangan because of
the diversity of vegetation in the area.
	   Besides the many different fruit trees, figs such as the tangkul
(Ficus racemosa) are a reliable food source for orang utans,
macaques, hornbills and even fish.
	   ``Fires will make it difficult for wildlife to obtain food.''
	   On the long-term effects, Reza says that once a peat swamp
burns, its natural cover will eventually be replaced by lalang.
	   ``Once that happens, natural vegetation cannot be recreated and
the place becomes grassland. It happened to one area next to Pin
Supu during the 1983 drought,'' he says.
	   Reza also fears that when the next drought season comes, the
issue of drought-induced fires on wildlife will resurface if no
action is taken now.
	   WWF scientific officer Martin Paul Vogel, who is based in Batu
Putih near the Pin Supu Forest Reserve, says that there is a need
to create awareness among locals on the importance of conserving
wildlife sanctuaries and forest reserves.
	   By creating such awareness, they will be able to benefit from
natural resources ``which creates a win-win situation for both
locals and the eco-system''.
	   ``Batu Putih is surrounded by forest reserves. However, locals
in the area are involved in fishing or doing part-time contract
jobs. Others work in nearby plantations.
	   ``Then there are others who are involved in illegal logging
activities,''
	   Vogel says.
	   ``We want to create an alternative economy for them,'' he adds,
``through local participation in tourism.''
	   ``We want locals to know how important tourism can be. They have
to bring the market to their produce, making it vital for them to
come up with products,'' he says.
	   Vogel feels that as there is no example of how tourism has
benefited the local community, it can be difficult convincing the
villagers.
	   While many parties are doing what they can to help save forest
reserves and sanctuaries in Kinabatangan, more needs to be done and
one way is by creating awareness.
	   Increased conservation efforts and creating permanant
fire-fighting units in forested areas are among the measures taken
by the Government.

	   It is shocking to see how lukewarm the reaction of the Western
world was after India out of the blue, made not one but five
nuclear tests. Wasn't that like a slap on the face of the Western
world, who think India to be so poor and helpless that it needs
all-out humanitarian aid. And they are so naive as to pump billions
of dollars of aid into a country which may be using it for nuclear
advancement and not to feed its poor- who knows? It is like putting
on gold and diamond jewelleries when you are sick inside, very sick
indeed, so that you have to ask others for help! Why should others
give aid to it at all? For it has shown to everybody that it
doesn't need anybody's alms or donations. If it is rich enough to
make nuclear bombs then it can take care of its poor too.
	   But that is not its priority, so why should others sympathize
with its poor, when the country itself doesn't care a bit for it
own suffering multitudes. Otherwise would it have spent billions of
dollars on nuclear tests when it could have very well fed millions
by this money? Looks like the West doesn't mind so much after all,
even if they have banned it. Everybody knows that Israel has
nuclear arsenals but did the West even raise an eye-brow, let alone
protest or make sanctions against it? But just compare its response
to Iraq who is not even nuclear. But for this double standard they
will have to pay one day. This nuclear warfare which they are
allowing to proliferate, turning a blind eye to it intentionally,
will rebound on them.
	   It is but one small planet that we have and we all have to live
in it, side by side, like it or not, want it or not. There is no
escape from it! The atmospheric pollution that the nuclear
proliferation is going to cause will surely affect everybody
leading to dreadful diseases like different kinds of cancer and
deaths. Knowing all the effects of nuclear proliferation, India's
ruling party's act must have been a very selfish one, just to
increase its popularity and to stay in power. Because everybody
knows that their position is a very shaky one. So to divert public
attention to something else this move may have been taken.
	   This is a glaring example of how the politicians harm their own
country for their political ambition.When a country goes nuclear,
its neighbours can't prosper as they normally would have, because
now they are under continuous threat to sacrifice their own
interests and please the nuclear power, whether they like it or
not. It exerts pressure on them. Thus its neighbours remain as
backward as it wants it to be, taking advantage of it in every
possible way. We have the example of East European countries before
us and it should alert us too. If it weren't for Russia's threat
and pressure they would have progressed just as the rest of Europe
did. Look at the state of Russia too, what a tattered condition it
is in now.
	   If not for the nuclear warfare, and it had spent its energy and
resources on development, it could have been prosperous like the
rest of Europe. Now Pakistan too has jumped into the same dark
well, following India, as the response of the world against the
former was not strong enough. They both should take lessons from
Russia's state now. What a waste of time, energy and money it all
was!

	   SMALL- and medium-sized industries can find out more about
accessing the RM1.5 billion SMI Fund at a trade fair at the Mines
Exhibition Centre in Kuala Lumpur which starts today.
	   The five-day Industry Tradefair Malaysia (ITM) and MachineTool
Malaysia (IMX) exhibition will feature for the first time
representatives of banks which sit on the fund's panel.
	   They will discuss with both exhibitors and visitors the more
relaxed loan requirements announced by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk
Seri Anwar Ibrahim recently, said Paul March, a director of
Overseas Exhibition Services Ltd. The company is affiliated to
Malaysian Exhibition Services Sdn Bhd, organiser of the annual
event.
	   ``For the first time representatives of the approved panel of
bankers are taking part in the event,'' he told a Press conference
in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The participating banks are Maybank Bhd, BSN Commercial Bank Bhd
and RHB Bank Bhd.
	   For the past 12 years, ITM/IMX has attracted more than 30,000
visitors annually. Turnout is expected to be lower this year in
view of the economic slowdown.
	   However, a representative of Malaysian Exhibition Services said
they are expecting ``no fewer than 20,000 visitors''.
	   More than 550 exhibitors from 29 countries are participating in
the event.
	   One of the products making a debut in Malaysia is a machine
which allows computer-aided designs to be transformed into
three-dimensional objects within a few hours.
	   According to its distributor, Siber Hegner (M) Sdn Bhd, the
US-made machine is useful for university research and in the
automotive manufacturing industry.
	   Another product is, according to its distributor, the fastest
and highest resolution ink-jet printer in the world.
	   The US-made Scitex printer boasts a resolution of 240 dpi x 240
dpi (dots per inch) with a top speed of 1,000 feet per minute, said
Diagraph's general manager, Amirah Khalid.
	   The event for the first time too will have a
``Made-in-Malaysia'' pavilion comprising 20 companies displaying
parts and components, accessories and tool and die products.

	   NUMECH Engineering (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd is negotiating with an
Italian manufacturer to produce palletisers that form an integral
part of the conveyor system.
	   If the deal materialises, its chief executive officer Michael
K.P. Siew said the company would acquire new technology for
expansion of the integrated raking production line.
	   Numech Engineering is involved in the manufacture and
fabrication of conveyor systems and components for the
manufacturing and automotive industries as well as other equipment
assembly lines.
	   The company, which utilises over 90 per cent local contents,
manufactures and fabricates components like press bearings gravity
roller and chain driven rollers.
	   Plans are also afoot to explore the Asean region for exports.
	   Siew said the company had also taken a forward synergistic step
by venturing into the production of integrated racking systems for
hypermarkets, retail sectors, warehouses and also the automotive
industry.
	   ``With the strong local demand for integrated racking systems,
the potential for the materials handling industry look extremely
bright,'' he said in a statement.
	   ``As compared to the imported systems, our locally produced ones
are competitively priced and would be at least 30 per cent
cheaper.''
	   Numech Engineering, which invests more than RM100,000 annually
in research and development, registered an annual turnover of RM8
million last year.
	   Taking a positive approach to maintain its workforce of about 70
people, the company has taken the initiative to provide in-house
training on CAD- CAM techniques to improve their skills.
	   At the same time, it is also adopting new marketing strategies
to build a wider networking of smart partnerships with its dealers
natiowide.

	   LOCAL furniture designers should focus on the mid-range to
high-end products to tap the markets in the US, Japan and Europe.
	   Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik said the
industry should steer away from manufacturing low-end products
which were facing stiff competition from countries like China and
Vietnam where production costs were low.
	   ``By embarking on high-end furniture products, we can hope to
increase our furniture exports which are doing well now despite the
economic downturn,'' he said, when speaking at a national seminar
on product finishing using Ultra-Violet/Electron-Beam technology in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   Furniture exports totalled RM2.6 billion last year and the
ministry hopes to achieve the target of RM4 billion by 2000.
	   It expects to export RM3.5 billion worth of furniture this year.
	   Dr Lim said a Malaysian design centre would be set up to
encourage Malaysians to go into furniture designing.
	   ``We then hope to produce a new group of furniture designers who
design for the competitive international market,'' he said, citing
outlets like High Point in the US and Harrods in the UK as
examples.
	   ``If we keep on designing what people want, then the market will
be flooded with standard designs whereas if we were to create our
own designs, we'll soon have our own market willing to pay more for
the exclusive made-in-Malaysia designs.''
	   The Malaysian Timber Industry Council has been asked to engage
reputable international furniture designers to design furniture for
Malaysia.
	   On complaints by Bumiputera furniture manufacturers of not
getting export credit refinancing facility, Dr Lim said he would be
meeting them next week.
	   He said the ``umbrella concept'' which Bumiputera furniture
makers come under, would have to be revised.
	   ``Instead of concentrating only on the lowest end of
furniture-making for schools and government departments, they
should be more competitive by competing with the rest,'' he said,
adding that the creativity of the Bumiputera furniture-makers had
yet to be tapped.
	   Bumiputera furniture- makers constitute about four per cent of
the total 2,500 furniture factories in the country.
	   Palm oil and furniture are among two resource-based industries
which the Government is pushing now to increase exports and find
new markets.
	   ``For instance in the case of furniture, we found new markets in
the Middle East countries.'' A mission from his ministry will be
heading for these countries later this year.
	   The one-day seminar was organised jointly by the Malaysian
Nuclear Society, Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology
Research, Malaysian Timber Industry Board and the Malaysian
Furniture Industry Council.
	   The seminar is designed to provide a broad overview of radiation
curing chemistry, equipment and applications in various industries
in particular wood-based and printing industries.
	   Radiation curing technology has been used on a commercial scale
in developed countries since the 1970s.
	   It is a non-thermal process by which the wet coatings are
converted into 100 per cent solid coatings by polymerisation or
cross-linking by exposing them either under an electron-beam or an
ultra-violet radiation.

	   Public causes, private funding
	   Fifty villages around Dhaka in Bangladesh are now in touch with
the outside world. They have recently acquired cellular phones.
GrameenPhone, a non-government organisation's project in the
country, has ensured that these villages are connected for basic
communication. And Iqbal Qadir, finance director of GrameenPhone,
says the rest of the villages in Bangladesh will be similarly
linked up in the next five years. Circumventing land lines and
hence the delays in putting a communication system in place,
GrameenPhone has definitely succeeded in this unique experiment. An
interesting aspect of the project is that it was funded largely by
private agencies -- it is 51 per cent owned by Telenor of Norway,
Grameen Telecom holds 35 per cent, Japan's Marubeni 9.5 per cent
and Gonofone of the US 4.5 per cent.
	   Sourcing private funds for public projects is gaining ground the
world over. In India too, a recent endeavour got encouraging
response. In January this year, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
floated India's first public issue of municipal bonds to raise
Rs100 crore. The purpose: to modernise its water and sewerage
system. Municipal commissioner B.K. Sinha recalls that the bond
issue was oversubscribed. ``We received tremendous public
participation in building better roads, and ensuring adequate water
supply and effective fire-fighting facilities for the city,'' he
says. Rio de Janeiro has conducted similar exercises. Luiz Villela,
financial and economic advisor at the city's municipal finance
secretariat talked about similar successes in attracting
large-scale private funding for public projects.
	   The experience, recounted at a two-day World Times (publishers
of WorldPaper) International Inquiry -- Enabling or Enslaving:
Money Matters and the Information Imperative -- held in Delhi late
last month, highlighted the realities of today's funding of public
projects. With national and trans-border public funding agencies
finding it increasingly difficult to finance sustainable social
development across the world, private funding agencies,
particularly venture capitalists, are expected to play a larger
role in the years ahead. The seminar combined the issue with that
of the information revolution. The global summit examined the
impact of both information and capital flows on nations,
enterprises, and communities. The inquiry was held in association
with ATT, State Street, United Nations Development Project (UNDP),
and Nasscom, with Business India as the media sponsor.
	   In fact, World Times has recently devised a Wealth of Nations
Index (WNI), measured in terms of a set of economic, information,
and social indicators. Wiford Welch, director of global research,
World Times, presented the WNI at the seminar. ``Gross domestic
product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) only measure
activities which involve exchange of money. However, future wealth
of a nation will depend on its ability to take advantage of the
information revolution,'' he explained. Viewed along these lines,
Taiwan, Israel, Czech Republic, South Korea, and Malaysia occupy
the top five slots among 40 countries worldwide. The common factors
binding the top five countries are: export-oriented market
economies, relatively limited natural resources, and small
populations.
	   The Indian government is planning initiatives in the area. In
his inaugural address, Union minister for power Rangarajan
Kumaramangalam confirmed the government's commitment to information
technology (IT) and revealed that India's administration was
planning to provide an Internet connection in every school across
the country. Kumaramangalam said since the service sector had come
to contribute a predominant share in the national economy, it was
certain that IT will play a crucial role.
	   With emphasis on measuring wealth creation on the basis of
economic, information, and social indicators, it becomes imperative
for nations to allow free flow of capital and labour. Ashok Advani,
publisher of Business India, said such freedom does not exist. He
pointed out that developed countries like the US are actually
restricting the free flow of capital and labour to further their
own interests. ``A foreign national cannot buy out an American or a
US-registered company unless he or she is an American citizen,''
said Advani. The free flow of labour, a factor crucial for wealth
creation besides capital, is further hindered by the prevalent visa
system, he added.
	   Reducing barriers in wealth creation and involving private
agencies in the process definitely appears to be the way to go.

	   ON May 17, the top brass of India's defence and atomic research
released a video film of the nuclear blasts set off earlier in the
week. The clip was shown by most international television channels
that evening, and experts were called in to comment on what it
revealed of the tests. What they missed was the strain of a song in
the soundtrack. Few outside the Indian subcontinent would have been
able to tell that the song was bande mataram, a patriotic hymn from
the 1882 novel Anandamath by Bankimchandra Chatterjee, a pioneer of
modern Bengali prose as well as of the nationalistic discourse of
colonial Bengal.
	   At the same time, most Indians, and not a few in Pakistan and
Bangladesh, will have recognised the tune. The song, written in a
strange mixture of Bengali and bastardised Sanskrit, was set to
music by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, and for a while it was
India's national anthem although seldom sung on State occasions.
Muslims resented its Hindu imagery, and it was replaced (State
records say ``supplemented'') by the other Bengali song that the
world knows as India's official anthem, one for which Tagore wrote
the words as well as the score.
	   Bankimchandra was an immensely learned man and an astonishingly
complex thinker. One of the first batch of graduates from the
University of Calcutta, he served as a civil magistrate in colonial
Bengal. After a minor novel in English, he went on to fashion,
almost single-handedly, the language of modern Bengali prose
fiction. He also wrote satires and essays on theology, history,
literature and politics.
	   The strange synthesis of ancient Eastern learning, European
Enlightenment philosophy, and the sociology of Comte and Spencer
which marked the nationalist discourse in late 19th-Century Bengal
owed an enormous lot to this one writer.
	   It might seem that the makers of the televised text of the
blasts cared little for this context or for that in the novel in
which the song appears. They were splicing on to a documentary
footage, to a trace of ``real'' life, the affective charge of a
piece of imaginative writing which had become, since the first
nationalist ripple in 1905, the slogan of patriots and martyrs. It
was planted as an interpretant with an instant affective reference,
not unlike the canned laughter in sitcoms or the Mozart phrases in
health food ads.
	   Sadly, the image-makers seem to lack the cultural innocence of
the vulgar. Anandamath tells the story of a band of political
ascetics who had led an uprising against the Muslim rulers of
Bengal in the 18th Century.
	   The setting offers Bankimchandra the scope to formulate an idea
of the nation state and of resistance in which the Hindus were the
natural heirs to the pre-Muslim empires. The song speaks of 70
million sons of the mother, and statistically this count should
include Muslims. The song thus carefully reinvents the idea of a
composite nation, and co-opts Muslims as part of a predominantly
Hindu idea of nationhood.
	   That idea is defined in opposition to British occupation
although the story is presumably about Muslim oppressors. One of
the ascetics in the novel shows a novice three images of the
goddess - the mother as she was in the past, the mother as she is
in the present, and the mother as she will be in the future. The
icons are three aspects of shakti, or the female divine principle,
which Hindus worship in images such as Durga and Kali.
	   What emerges from this unorthodox transformation of Hindu
iconography is what one recent critic has called a Durkheimian
goddess of social cohesion, a mother who is fertile, resplendent
and comforting, a fallen deity awaiting resurgence through the
heroic sacrific of her sons.
	   The appeal of this goddess for political ascetics deprived of
physical resources of struggle under colonial rule is easily
understood. Its import was not lost even on the imperial secret
service which saw the song and the novel as a source of dangerous
inspiration for terrorists in later decades.
	   Outsiders would find the import of all this for the recent
nuclear blasts less easy to follow. The recent tests were codenamed
Shakti 98, the Sanskrit word meaning the female principle in the
cosmos, the consort of Siva the destroyer, as well as energy and
power.
	   Already there are extremist political groups talking of
constructing a shrine or shaktipeeth at the blast site, which would
be one added to the 52 centres of pilgrimage thus known over which
the dismembered body of Sati, another mythical incarnation of
shakti, was supposedly scattered by a frenzied and mourning Siva.
	   It is not just coincidence that the first three blasts took
place on the birth anniversary of the Buddha, the original apostle
of non-violence who had challenged brahminical orthodoxy in
northern India. The major Hindu nationalistic party in power today
used, with a fine eye for irony, the same coded message to inform
the Prime Minister's Office of the blasts' success that had been
used by their secular rivals after the first test in 1974. The
message read, ``Lord Buddha smiled.''
	   The choice of the tune on the soundtrack had thus the function
of jogging the collective memory of a nation forged under the sign
of shakti during the incipient phase of a militant Hindu
nationalism which the present rulers of India are unembarrassed to
claim as their historical legacy.
	   Aurobindo Ghosh, the leader of the early terrorist resistance in
Bengal, wrote in 1905: ``For what is a nation? What is our mother
country? ... It is a might Shakti composed of the millions of units
that make up the nation ... The Shakti we call India ... is the
living unity of the Shaktis of three hundred million people ...''
The clever conflation of the senses of shakti as mother goddess and
as power or energy was one which had sought to unite a ``nation''
ridden with contradictions. The conflation is the same as that
which the present ruling coalition seeks to exploit in the text of
the blast remixed for the teletechnomedia.
	   Such methods are not the monopoly of any particular ideology. A
little over a decade back, Satyajit Ray, in his film version of
Tagore's novel Home and the World had used the slogan bande mataram
as part of a musical motif to signal all that was destructive and
exclusionist in the ``nationalist'' movement of 1905. Destruction
and exclusion in the name of nation, as Tagore and Ray would have
agreed, can still find plenty of uses for other people's words and
other people's tunes.
	   The irony of that exclusionist enterprise was brought home just
the other day as Pakistan first detonated five nuclear devices in
pyrrhic answer to the ``Hindu bomb''. Semantic limits are known to
adjust themselves to political boundaries. How many, given the
gruesome history of India's partition, would care to recall that
the Muslims of undivided India were taught to claim Bankimchandra's
song as their own? And who would have thought the song could be
made to indigenise a technology which by necessity must remain
international?
	   Last year, a Japanese multinational recording company released a
hit album by one of India's most talented composers, A.R. Rahman.
Rahman is a recent convert to Islam, but he celebrated the golden
jubilee of India's independence by a pop rendering of a rewritten
version of bande mataram.
	   The promotional video of the song shows Indian villagers on
camels and elephants converging to receive the national tri-colour
lowered from an army helicopter. It is a complex image of a
superceded and dismembered nation, and its superceded anthem,
reclaiming their place in history through the high-tech
achievements of its scientists and techno-pop composers.
	   However transparent, this was perhaps less cheap than the slogan
jai vigyan (victory to science) that the Indian Prime Minister
coined during his visit to the blast site.
	   Is there a lesson in all this for literary theory? The use of
the song on the soundtrack reminded me of the conclusion of Anthony
Burgess' novel End of the World News, where we see a group of
privileged humans, or rather Western humans, leave the destroyed
planet on a spaceship stacked with provisions for an indefinite
period. The ship zooms into orbit while a recording of Mozart's
Jupiter Symphony is played for those on board as a token of the
highest cultural achievements of the ruined civilisation they leave
behind.
	   What `meaning' could we salvage for this apocalyptic version of
a text spinning endlessly in a context-free orbit? Surely such an
effort would involve the memory of what other people had tried to
say in another time and place as much as what the text could say
only to us, the survivors on board? Surely, it would be justified
as much by reconstructed histories of intention as by contingent
circumstances of reception?
	   There is just so much we have the right to do with other
people's words.
	   Fixing the referent may be a more important condition of freeing
the meaning of texts than a blind celebration of the unchecked
exorbitance of language. When the sound of a fiddle is added to a
videotape of Rome's destruction it is dangerous to be seduced by
the endless possibilities of relevance one could invent for Nero's
score. For, as we have recently learnt in India, a song celebrating
the beauty of a piece of our planet can make us feel tearfully
proud even as we acquire the means of destroying it.

	   New bars on bills
	   In Taratola, south Calcutta, working hours have become a lot
less stressful for employees of the Calcutta Electric Supply
Corporation (CESC). Early last year, this R.P. Goenka-owned company
decided to introduce bar-coded bills, the first time ever for an
Indian utility. As hoped for, this minimised keyboard entry and
reduced errors, delays, and long customer queues. Says Samiran
Ghosh, CESC's deputy general manager (treasury and payroll
administration): ``In this office we cater to about 8,000 people
daily. Earlier, it took the whole day to accept payments. Now we
wrap up by the close of banking hours (3 pm).''
	   Of the CESC's 35 offices in Calcutta, 10 already have all the
infrastructure in place. That is, hardware like a point-of-sale
(POS) computer (costing Rs1.5 lakh) at the cash collection point,
together with a scanner and a printer (for issuing receipts). These
in turn are connected to the company's billing server, which keeps
customer records. With a total investment of about Rs5 crore, the
benefits are immense. As the bar code contains the consumer number
and the amount paid, this data flows from the POS to the
centralised billing centre, where ledgers can be updated
immediately, thus cutting down the payment-to-reconciliation cycle.
Though several utilities use electric cash registers, this does not
enable online data transfer. Multiple entries leave ample scope for
mistakes. In fact, most utilities have had to create a ``suspense
account amount'' for money that lies idle due to the inability to
reconcile payments.
	   Taking its cue from CESE's experience, the Mahanagar Telephone
Nigam Limited (MTNL) in Delhi and Mumbai also recently opted for
bar-coding. Beginning last year, this government-owned telephone
company has been issuing only bar-coded bills and has installed
about a dozen POS machines in both metros. ``We have a total of 200
collection points and hope to put up machines at almost 80 of these
in the next three months,'' says T.R. Wadhwa, general manager,
MTNL, Delhi. In Mumbai, one of the company's nine area offices has
been wired up. Since the infrastructure is not completely in place,
all bills also carry all the information contained in the bar code
separately.
	   The need for efficiency has always existed. Says Tanmoy
Chakrabarty, country manager (POS) for Siemens Nixdorf Information
Systems: ``Most utilities are increasing their subscriber base by
at least 10-15 per cent annually. There is an urgent need to
enhance customer satisfaction and to streamline revenue collection
management, especially as government subsidies are reducing.''
Siemens Nixdorf has been a part supplier to both utilities. And
now, Delhi Vidyut Board, BEST in Mumbai, and the telephone
companies in Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, and
Secunderabad are also reported to be considering a switchover.
	   But like most automation plans at age-old companies, the
transition is not entirely seamless. At CESC, for instance, there
has been some employee resistance on account of fears that it may
result in staff retrenchment. ``It will create some people surplus
at our collection centres, but they will all be gainfully employed
in the company,'' stresses Ghosh, who has a target of March 1999 to
complete the programme. With most other utilities still
government-owned, cutting through the bureaucracy may take longer.

Study finds dementia in most 100-year-olds AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A new study suggests if you make it to age 100,
you can expect to leave a good chunk of your mental abilities
behind.
	   Dutch researchers tracked down every centenarian in three towns
and found at least 12 of the 17 were moderately to severely
demented, and three more had mild dementia. They weren't able to
test the two others.
	   Not one of the tested participants who was capable of
conversation could draw a clock face that indicated a given time.
	   The results are gloomy, said Dr. Ben Blansjaar, who presented
the study Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association. He said that he suspects the findings will
apply to American baby boomers when they, too, reach 100, but that
medications might help.
	   An American expert said he believes the finding reflects a bleak
truth about extreme old age. But others had doubts.
	   And nobody has a solid answer for how common dementia is among
centenarians.
	   Finding out is important because centenarians are a rapidly
growing group, and planners want to know what their health care
needs will be. In 1995, the United States had about 45,000 white
citizens age 100 or older. By the year 2050, that figure will grow
to 607,000. Among blacks, it is projected to grow to 116,000 from
7,000.
	   Researchers are just starting to look at the mental status of
the oldest of the old, those 85 and above.
	   One big question: ``If you live to be an old enough age, will
everybody become demented? We really don't know,'' said Neil
Buckholtz, chief of the dementias of aging branch at the National
Institute on Aging.
	   Blansjaar is a psychiatrist at the St. Joris Gasthuis
psychiatric hospital in Delft, the Netherlands. He and colleagues
found all the centenarians in three towns with a combined
population of 250,000. The group they identified had an average age
of 101, and 15 of the 17 were women.
	   Five of the centenarians examined were in an almost vegetative
mental state. Of the 10 others, only one knew the year, month, date
and day of the week. Only two could adequately explain what two out
of three familiar proverbs mean.
	   Still, the woman who scored best on a battery of tests ``would
have fooled everyone who isn't experienced in the diagnosis of
dementia,'' Blansjaar said.
	   Buckholtz said the Dutch study is too small to give a reliable
estimate of the prevalence of dementia among the very old, and it's
not clear whether the numbers would apply to other populations. He
said that he knows of unpublished research that suggests 20 percent
to 30 percent of centenarians are demented, but that there are no
solid figures.

World Cup qualifiers draw 0-0 in unattractive exhibition 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with lineups.
<TEXT>
	   CRETEIL, France (AP) _ Fellow World Cup qualifiers Mexico and
Saudi Arabia played to an unattractive 0-0 draw Wednesday, with
North Americans having most of the possession and the Saudis the
better scoring chances.
	   Playing before a crowd of 5,000 in a small venue, the Saudis
opened the game with an opportunity in the first minute when Khalid
al-Muwalid shot wide from one yard. And in the 22nd, Sami al-Jaber
couldn't head a ball from good position, with Mexican goalkeeper
Osvaldo Perez beaten.
	   Luis Garcia troubled the Saudis the most, but failed on three
chances. He shot high from 10 yards in the first half and wasting
two more opportunities in the second. On the first he shot wide
after receiving a pass from Luis Hernandez and was blocked by Saudi
Mohammed al-Dayea.
	   Mexico used an experimental lineup in which Garcia started up
front along side Ricardo Pelaez while regular strikers Hernandez
and Cuauhtemoc Blanco played wide midfield.
	   The experiment didn't seem particularly successful, but Mexican
coach Manuel Lapuente said he was ``satisfied'' with his team's
performance.
	   ``We made several changes in our lineup and played well at the
end,'' he said. ``During the World Cup you'll see a very different
team. Against South Korea (Mexico's first opponent) you'll see the
result of our job.''
	   ___  
  Lineups  
	   Mexico: Oscar Perez, Isaac Terrazas, Raul Lara, Joel Sanchez,
Salvador Carmona, German Villa, Marcelino Bernal, Luis Hernandez
(Jesus Palencia-69) , Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Jesus Arellano, 69th
minute), Ricardo Pelaez (Ramon Ramirez, 52nd), Luis Garcia.

<TEXT>
	   IN his Foreword, Rehman Rashid is quite generous in his praise
of the three youngish writers whose essays are collected in this
book. In fact, he positively gushes as he ends with the following
line: ``Personally, I think they're quite wonderful.''
	   It must be difficult to write a foreword for a book like this.
You are forced to say nice things about all three writers and you
must choose your words carefully so as not to appear to favour one
over the other two. I must say Rehman's Foreword is a peerless
specimen of diplomatic nicety. He has nice things to say about all
three writers.
	   His reference to Stothard's ``iron-fisted political
consciousness'', Kam's ``velvet-gloved, golden-hearted social
commentary'', and the ``precocious''
	   and ``peerless'' ease of Amir's prose, highlights their
respective strengths, and indeed, nicely summarises the essential
qualities of each writer.
	   On the other hand, the obligation to be equally nice to all
three writers has led Rehman to generalise in a way that glosses
over their strengths and weaknesses, especially the latter. A
reviewer fortunately does not have to labour under such an
obligation, and I can, for example, point out that the following
passage appears to me to describe not all three writers, but just
one of them: They all write very well; these pieces sparkle with
literary felicity and thoughtful craftsmanship. Yet, these skills
are rarely indulged to the point where style outshines substance.
	   I am, of course, referring to Amir.
	   Amir's prose sparkles; that of the other two writers do not.
It's as straightforward as that. Both Kam and Stothard have done
themselves a great injustice by allowing their pieces to appear in
the same volume as Amir's. Their weaknesses stand out in starker
relief when their pieces are put beside Amir's, and their strengths
are overshadowed by the overwhelming burst of energy that
characterises Amir's writing.
	   Stothard's essays, for example, are marked by a strong sense of
commitment towards her subject. If you were to read them on their
own, with nothing else coming before or after to influence, however
slightly, your impression of them, you might think her writing
sincere, down-to- earth, committed, and even passionate, on
occasion. Put beside Amir's pieces, however, you cannot help but
think how stodgy her prose is in comparison to Amir's fluent
writing. You can't help but think that she tries too hard, that she
belabours her point, that she loads her prose with too much
unnecessary baggage.
	   This baggage sometimes comes in the form of extended allusion to
literary texts. In fact, you would hardly call them allusions, for
what you get are synopses of large chunks of various texts. In `Law
and Order', for example, where she makes a very cogent point about
abuse of power and perversion of justice, she gives you a
description of the character of Angelo, from Shakespeare's play
Measure for Measure, and holds him up as an example of someone who
abuses his position of authority.
	   Not only do you get two whole paragraphs given over to this
treatment of Angelo, you get in addition one footnote telling you
that Measure for Measure is one of Shakespeare's later plays, and
that it is usually grouped together with three other plays which
she proceeds to list.
	   Finally, she supplies you with the date of the first
performance. She also quotes four lines from the play and you get
another footnote telling you where exactly in the text they come
from.
	   Shakespeare turns up again in `Umno  the Bard', which is little
more than a list of Shakespeare plays and characters and brief
synopses of three plays.
	   Take `Hope  Hypocrisy' as another case in point. The piece
begins with a description of the subject matter and theme of F.
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and the writer goes on to
attempt to establish parallels between the novel and contemporary
Kuala Lumpur. You never lose sight of the novel and the whole piece
could possibly have passed off as a Sixth Form or even an
undergraduate essay on The Great Gatsby.
	   This all smells very fishy and appears as if the writer is using
all these opinion pieces as so many excuses to fob off some
`literature' on you, or, worse, to educate you.
	   The writer sometimes shoulders her literary and intellectual
baggage in a more subtle, but perhaps equally uncomfortable manner,
at the verbal level. In a piece talking about the possibility of an
Islamic Renaissance in Malaysia, she points to positive signals put
out by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in two
separate speeches and then concedes that ``two speeches do not a
renaissance make''.
	   There is an uncomfortable marriage here of the traditional maxim
-''two wrongs do not make a right'' - and an inversion of word
order (putting the verb last) which used to be common in poetry and
which is still sometimes used as a means of making something sound
grand. What you sense here is not style outshining substance, but
style flopping on its belly.
	   Amir sometimes gets dangerously close to letting his style
eclipse his substance but let's see what happens when he lets a
literary echo slip into his prose. In a piece about journalistic
sycophancy, he refers to the Prime Minster as ``the voice that
launched a thousand editorials''. Now, this is a direct allusion to
a line from Shakespeare's contemporary, Christopher Marlowe,
referring to Helen of Troy as the cause of the quarrel that led to
the launch of ``a thousand ships'' headed for the siege of Troy.
You don't of course need to know any of this to understand the
phrase as Amir has it in his piece or even to appreciate the
humour.
	   At the same time, the humour deepens for you if you notice the
mock-heroic discrepancy between Helen and Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad as well as that between the thousand ships laden with
war-hungry Greek warriors and the thousand sycophantic editorials.
	   In complete contrast to Stothard, Kam travels light. In the
first place, he does not deal with issues nearly as weighty as
those which Stothard likes to sink her teeth into. With the
exception of two pieces near the end, all the pieces of his which
appear in this book were first published in Men's Review and Day 
Night, which presumably have fewer intellectual pretensions than
The Sun, in which all but three of Stothard's essays first
appeared.
	   You do indeed sense the touch of a velvet-glove in most of Kam's
pieces, but at the same time, you will also realise after reading a
few of them that it is not so much society that he is caressing
with a velvet-gloved hand, but himself. What comes through in these
pieces, once you get over the disarming effect of the mildly bluff
manner and the coy prose, is the overwhelming sense of someone
trying to foist not his intellectual baggage on you this time, but
himself.
	   He goes on about his insecurity over his spotty education; he
talks about his imminent 30th birthday the way Madonna, say, might
talk about her impending menopause; he talks about his father; he
tells us what he would do if he were Prime Minister; he talks about
his mother's attempts to marry him off.
	   The most interesting of Kam's pieces in this volume are the very
two that come near the end of the book and, as it happens, it is in
these two pieces that you would find those rare occasions where he
stops caressing Kam Raslan for a bit and reaches his velvet-gloved
hand out to stir things up in the world at large.
	   Both, we are told, have not been previously published and one of
them, a footnote informs us, was ``spiked'' - newsroom jargon for
copy that has been rejected. Innocent as this piece may seem to be
to unreformed liberals like you and me, it is quite obvious why the
editor shied away from seeing this go to print: it takes a mildly
ironic look at the Internal Security Act.
	   The other previously unpublished piece is a series of loosely
connected reflections on the four days the writer spent in a police
lock-up. There is no indication in the piece as to the occasion
behind this extraordinary event; not even a hint in a footnote.
Clearly, one last coy gesture to end a whole string of them.
	   Stothard however writes about what is presumably the same event
in an article conveniently placed a dozen pages prior to Kam's and
a comparison of the two shows up the different qualities of the two
very nicely.
	   Stothard begins her piece with a stark account of the
demonstration organised by 600 men against APCET II, an NGO seminar
on the East Timor issue held in Kuala Lumpur in November 1996 and
her arrest along with other participants of the seminar. Yes, the
very event which sent shudders down the spine of unreformed
liberals like you and me.
	   Her spare prose here and the starkness of her account brings out
the dark irony of the situation very nicely. The rest of the piece
is a reflection on the event. She draws parallels between the 600
men calling themselves Barisan Bertindak Rakyat Malaysia and the
Nazi youth movement and Mao's Red Guards and then quotes at length
from a German intellectual who was harassed to his death by
Hitler's secret police. Of course, you get a proper footnote here
documenting the source of the quotation.
	   Her references to Nazism, the Red Guards and Walter Benjamin
take up more than half the article and in my opinion overwhelms the
piece. The chilling point that she makes about the spectre of
extreme right-wing forces rearing its head in this country loses
its force under the weight of all that intellectual baggage, and
all the verbiage spent in filling in the historical background for
her readers.
	   Not to be left out, Stothard lets us know in a footnote that
this piece was ``spiked'' by two publications before Aliran
published it.
	   Amir Muhammad has no ``spiked'' article to offer us in this
volume but he has absolutely no need to wear this badge of honour.
He reaches such outrageous heights in the pieces here (he has a
foolhardy editor perhaps?) that only a very obtuse person would
question his credentials.
	   In contrast to the intellectual and literary baggage which
overwhelms so many of Stothard's pieces, you will find bits of
popular culture, current affairs trivia, bons mots or just plain
wickedness strewn artlessly all over Amir's pieces. Unlike the
rather woolly social consciousness that occasionally comes through
in Kam's pieces (when he's not talking about himself that is), both
Amir and Stothard make very cogent, often hard-hitting and usually
definite statements about politics and society.
	   The difference between Stothard and Amir lies in the fact that
the latter is completely at ease with his medium and effortlessly
bends his prose to serve his purpose, while the former gets too
involved with her prose and lets her knowledge of weighty things
overwhelm her subject.

	   The smart option
	   A growing industry dependent on emerging markets doesn't sound
very promising, right? Wrong, say the major players in the nascent
smart (or chip) card industry in India. France-based Gemplus India
Pvt Ltd and $10-billion global utilities giant Schlumberger contend
that markets in Asia and the Pacific are growing fast and that
explains their entry into India.
	   Gemplus set up a wholly-owned subsidiary last June, and is now
poised to establish an RD centre at Bangalore and invest $20
million over the next three years. And by the end of 1999, Gemplus
plans to set up a hi-tech smart card manufacturing facility. Says
Philippe Carrere, director, ``The Indian market is definitely
opening up to smart card products and we see increasing large-scale
integration of this technology in applications such as
telecommunications, health, transportation, and access control.''
	   Schlumberger, which entered the market earlier, set up a 100 per
cent subsidiary in India in December 1996 for the smart card
business. Schlumberger Measurement  System India Ltd (SMSIL)
focuses on electronic transaction products like smart cards,
terminals, and complete systems. Says Deepak Ghai, director
(business development), SMSIL: `` We set up an RD centre at
Gurgaon in February 1997 and further investment will depend on
requirements. We have projected a turnover of Rs25 crore for next
year.'' The initial investment it proposes to make in India is $10
million.
	   However, is the enthusiasm well-placed? A survey by Gemplus
Technologies Asia last year showed that Asia accounted for just 14
per cent of the smart card business, while Europe and the Middle
East accounted for 76 per cent. The figures, it says, will change
drastically by AD 2003, with a 40 per cent share for Asia and 35
per cent for Europe. The number of smart cards is expected to go up
from 600 million in 1996 to around three billion by 2000, and
Asia's contribution is expected to be significant. And the main
applications for smart cards are seen in telecom, banking,
transportation, and healthcare.
	   One market that has remained largely untapped is credit cards,
where magnetic stripe cards still rule the roost. Says Ghai,
``Indian banks need to invest in the infrastructure for smart cards
since there is a demand for efficient and convenient banking.'' The
potential is huge. ``There are six lakh cards users and if all the
magnetic stripe cards can be converted into smart cards, the market
is substantial,'' comments an industry source. However, it should
be noted that smart cards are in use in only a handful of countries
in Europe, among them France and Germany.
	   Smart cards emphasise convenience and security. ``It has the
potential of a computer and is as innovative as the human mind,''
says one industry observer. They are being touted as an effective
alternative to the magnetic stripe cards as they reduce the cost of
communication (off-line transactions are possible), reduce bank
fraud, and offer greater security. Magnetic stripe cards are
currently more popular mainly because they are less expensive
(industry sources say there is a difference of about Rs150 per
card) and also due to lack of awareness about smart cards. In the
meantime, however, the duo are waiting for some firm government
policies on basic telecom services and the shift to smart cards in
the credit card industry. Adds Ghai, ``We are also waiting for some
pilot project to take off in the Indian market.'' Both companies
are working on projects with local companies and are upbeat about
them. Schlumberger is doing a project with Escorts Finance for
developing E-cash, a prepaid card for departmental store Nanz's
outlets and other merchants establishments. The company is also
working on a pilot project with Verifone, the Reserve Bank, the
State Bank of India, and Canara Bank at IIT Mumbai to educate them
about smart card applications.
	   Gemplus worked with Calcutta-based Elecom to launch a passbook
application based on a microprocessor smart card. Says Carrere,
``This off-line solutions allows cardholders to withdraw money or
make deposits at any branch in India. It enables banks to track
transactions on the card.'' Gemplus is working on another major
project with IIT Mumbai to develop an electronic debit card for
E-purse applications. Canara Bank and SBI will be the issuers of
this card.
	   For the smart card providers, the challenges lies in the
multiple applications of these cards, including utility payments
and purchases of petrol or diesel. With the players confident that
the market in basic services will open up this year, they feel
things can only change for the better.

Giant mechanical elephant will travel - for the right price

	   LONDON (AP) _ For those with eccentric taste in transport - or
who can never remember where they have parked the car - an
auctioneer is offering for sale a life-size mechanical elephant.
	   The one and a half ton jumbo, powered by a 10-horsepower Ford
engine, was built in 1949 as a fairground attraction for Blackpool
pier in northwest England. It was designed to carry up to 12
children, and has three forward and one reverse gear. It's top
speed is 12 mph (19 kph).
	   Just to prove it is in working order, antiques dealer Emma
Hawkins, 25, took the motorized elephant for a drive outside west
London's Olympia exhibition center Wednesday, where it is the star
attraction at an antiques fair.
	   ``Wonderful, very comfortable, far more comfortable than a real
elephant,'' said Ms. Hawkins said after clambering off the
elephant.
	   The 8 foot (2.4 meter) high, steel framed machine is covered in
hide-like cloth and comes complete with flappable ears and resin
tusks.
	   Ms. Hawkins' father John bought the elephant from restorer Hew
Kennedy last month, and wants to sell it for 100,000 pounds (dlrs
160,000).
	   ``It is unique and it is wonderful but only someone who was
rather eccentric would want to own such a thing,'' said John
Hawkins.
	   Kennedy agreed.
	   ``Once you've got it going, what is the point in owning it? You
would have to be quite deranged to own it,'' he said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Sixteen former workers of a golf club will
receive an average of two months salary in addition to retrenchment
benefits following the intervention today of Human Resources
Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek.
	   The workers had brought their grievances to the minister's
attention as they were unhappy at being retrenched by the
management of Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club when it employed
40 foreign workers.
	   The 16 laid-off workers who earned between RM550 and RM850 per
month were employed as field workers.
	   ``After negotiations, the KLGCC management has agreed to
increase the retrenchment benefits by paying 25 days salary for
each year of service for those who had worked less than five years
and 30 days salary for each year of service for those with more
than five years service,'' Lim told reporters.
	   Under the Employment Act 1955, those working for less than five
years should be paid 15 days salary for each year of service while
those working more than five years must be paid 20 days salary for
each year of service.
	   ``I am very grateful to the KLGCC management for paying more
than the statutory requirement.
	   ``It did not take much effort for me to convince the
management,'' he said, adding that they (the management) had cited
the economic problems for the retrenchment.
	   KLGCC is owned by Solarvest Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Sime Darby Group.
	   Later, Lim met the workers, among others, asking them whether
they were interested to be reinstated.
	   However, workers' representative V. Indrani said they only
wanted higher retrenchment benefits and were not interested to be
reinstated because some of them were old (above 50 years).

	   Raghu and Gopal live in Chikaldhara and Badvane tahsils of
Madhya Pradesh, in an area that will be submerged once the Sardar
Sarovar dam is built. Between them, Raghu and Gopal will lose 65
acres of land which provides them their livelihood -- they grow
cotton, jowar, maize, sugarcane, and bananas on it. With a stay
order from the Supreme Court, work on the dam is at a standstill.
But the construction already stands 82 metres high, enough to cause
damage to the nearby areas. During the monsoon season, the nearby
areas get submerged up to five metres. When there is heavy rainfall
and the Narmada river is in spate, things get worse and the
villagers have to find shelter a kilometre away. The government is
promising to relocate their families in Gujarat. ``But the land in
Gujarat is not as fertile. The government has also said that there
is enough drinking water and electricity for 40 million people in
Gujarat, but no drinking water scheme has been finalised,'' says
Raghu.
	   The Narmada movement has been fighting against a big dam in
western India. As a fundraiser for the people of the Narmada
valley, the movement held an art exhibition in Mumbai recently. The
proceeds of the sale are to be used towards development work in the
Narmada valley and to help those who are affected by the
construction of the dam. Over a 100 artists from all over the
country participated in the exhibition. In fact the response was so
good that four art galleries had to be commissioned for the
exhibition.
	   Inspired by the Narmada movement, well-known names such as
Laxman Shrestha, Manjit Bawa, and Nalini Malini, to mention a few,
are gifting their works for the cause of the environment. Not all
have painted to the theme. While Anju Dodiya has painted a head,
her typical style, husband Atul Dodiya has done a canvas aptly
titled Crossing the Narmada -- 1930, a scene depicting Gandhi
crossing the Narmada. The paintings are priced between Rs1,500
(Arpan Mukherjee and Suranjan Basu's lithographs) and Rs2 lakh
(Gogi Saroj Pal's oil on canvas).

	   JAKARTA (JP): State firm PT Krakatau Steel (KS) confirmed
yesterday that the government had agreed to sell up to 51 percent
of the company's shares to Netherlands-based Ispat International.
	   But the company's executives said that they were not consulted
about the deal.
	   Krakatau Steel's acting president, Djoko Subagyo, said he and
members of the company's board of directors and commissioners were
only invited to attend the May 7 signing of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the government and Ispat.
	   ``Please note that we were there to witness the signing
ceremony, but we, the board of directors and commissioners, never
got reports on the deal, not even a copy of the MOU,'' Djoko told
reporters, adding that the decision seemed ``illogical''.
	   He referred reporters to State Minister of the Empowerment of
State Enterprises Tanri Abeng, who signed the agreement, should
there be more questions regarding Krakatau Steel's privatization.
	   According to the MOU, the Indonesian government has agreed to
sell 49 percent of Krakatau Steel's shares but will allow Ispat to
buy up to 51 percent if the offer is attractive.
	   The sales of Krakatau Steel's 49 percent will be worth about
US$400 million, or half of the company's estimated assets of $800
million.
	   The MOU also says that Ispat will complete all due diligence by
June 21 and the binding and sales purchases agreement will be
executed by June 30.
	   It says Krakatau will not disclose any nonpublic information
concerning the deal to a third party without the former's written
consent until July 7.
	   Krakatau Steel, the country's largest steel producer, is one of
the seven state companies to be privatized by the government either
through initial public offerings or private placement by inviting
strategic investors.
	   The company's former president, Soetoro Mangoensoewargo, who
resigned from his job Monday, questioned the legitimacy of the MOU
deal, which he called ``mysterious''.
	   ``I was present at the ceremony. After signing the agreement
Tanri pocketed the MOU and took it away with him,'' Soetoro said
yesterday.
	   ``Neither I nor (Krakatau's chief commissioner) Tunky Ariwibowo
was informed about the deal, prior to or after the signing.I even
got the copy of the MOU from someone else,'' he said.
	   Both Soetoro and Djoko said there had not been any due diligence
following the agreement signing.
	   Soetoro said the MOU violated earlier strategic agreements about
Krakatau's privatization.
	   The government had previously planed to sell 25 percent to 30
percent of the company's shares during the first phase of
privatization.
	   After that, a further 15 percent to 19 percent of the shares
were to be offered to the public, leaving the state owning the
remaining 51 percent.
	   Soetoro said that if Ispat owned 49 percent of Krakatau's
shares, there would a new monopoly in the domestic wire rod market,
as Ispat's fully owned local subsidiary, the Surabaya-based PT
Ispat-Indo, is currently the largest producer of wire rods,
producing 450,000 metric tons annually.
	   If Ispat owns Krakatau Steel, which now produces 300,000 tons of
wire rods a year, both companies' production would account for 80
percent of the domestic capacity.
	   Soetoro also said he objected to the fact that Krakatau Steel
was to fall into the hands of Ispat, which he called ``a company
whose specialty is buying bankrupt companies''.
	   ``Krakatau Steel has been performing well, and has not suffered
losses since 1986,'' he added.
	   Producers of nails, welded wires, iron wires and wire mesh told
reporters yesterday they disapproved of Ispat's purchase of
Krakatau Steel.
	   ``We are worried that it will spur unhealthy competition, a
monopoly in the wire rod industry for Ispat-Indo,'' said Supri
Handono, the chairman of the association of smelting wire
industries.
	   The company expects its net profit to rise to Rp 200 billion
from Rp 182 billion last year, and its sales to increase to Rp 3.5
trillion from Rp 3 trillion, due to a drastic rise in exports which
now total 80 percent of the production.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Lim Keng Yaik said China proposed to sell two million tonnes of
corn to Malaysia, for use as animal feed, in exchange for 300,000
tonnes of palm oil under a counter-trade agreement.
	   ``I have contacted Malaysian animal feed importers to see if
they can take up the offer,'' he told reporters after opening a
national seminar on product finishing using
Ultra-Violet/Electron-Beam technology at Kuala Lumpur today.
	   Dr Lim who recently visited China to discuss bilateral trade and
investment, said he had informed them that prices would have to be
quoted at the usual international rates.
	   If the palm oil-corn barter was successful, Malaysia could look
at other commodities.
	   During the seminar, participants heard that radiation curing
technology had been developed and well accepted by the wood-based,
printing and electronic industries in the past five years.
	   Khairul Zaman and Mohamad Hilmi Mahmood from the Malaysian
Institute for Nuclear Technology Research in Bangi, said the
wood-based industry was increasingly using ultra-violet curing
technology, in particular for parquet and furniture finishing.
	   It amounts to less than 10 per cent of the total capacity of
finished wood based products.
	   They said the number of users in the printing and electronoic
industries had however not increased much in the past five years.
	   ``Further effort is required to expand the utilisation of
radiation curing technology in the existing area and to continue
the follow through concept,'' they said. Users should learn about
industrial safety including ultra-violet radiation and chemicals.

	     Mexican newspaper runs interview with alleged kidnapper of 20
people
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Accusing his victims of greed, a man
identifying himself as the kidnapper of some 20 people told a
Mexican newspaper he had cut off his victims' ears and vowed he
would never surrender.
	   ``I believe I am going to hell,'' a man claiming to be Daniel
Arizmendi said in a long telephone interview published Wednesday in
the newspaper Reforma.
	   The man gave details of Arizmendi's background to prove his
identity. The federal attorney general's office said it had no
immediate comment on the authenticity of the interview.
	   Police across Mexico have been hunting for Arizmendi since they
captured his wife, son and daughter in a May 21 raid on safehouses
in Cuernavaca, 35 miles (60 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   Some authorities have blamed the former Morelos state policeman
for as many as 200 kidnappings in the past few years, but the
interviewed man confessed to about 20.
	   All victims were either released or killed and police say they
have seized about dlrs 946,000 U.S. and 32 million pesos (dlrs 3.5
million) from Arizmendi's safe houses and bank accounts.
	   In the interview, the man denied ``that I treated them badly,
that I beat them.'' But did he cut off ears? ``That, yes,'' he
said.
	   ``Their relatives, in spite of having so much money, did not
want to give it to me. It was like I told them: God is going to
punish you for avarice,'' the man said.
	   ``I believe I am going to hell, no? And the relative who did not
want to give the money, how would you judge that person?''
	   The man denied prosecutors' claims that agents of at least four
police forces were on Arizmendi's payroll.
	   ``I swear that nobody ever protected me.... I don't trust
anybody beyond myself and the people I invite to work with me. ...
The government or some government agent or some judicial policeman?
No. They would sell you themselves.''
	   The man claimed that officials were fabricating kidnapping
charges against Arizmendi's relatives, though he admitted they
helped him launder money and obtain false documents.
	   ``I told them, `Look, take money, buy a house, go someplace I
don't know because the day something happens to me with you, they
are going to blame you','' the man said.
	   The man said police had offered to free his family in return for
his surrender.
	   ``They are also kidnapping my family,'' he said. ``I kidnap for
money, put pressure so they will give me money. They are putting
pressure so that I will surrender. I take somebody innocent. They
are also taking somebody innocent. We are the same.''
	   He said he loved his family but would ``definitely not''
surrender for them. ``If there is one thing I fear, it is prison
and poverty. Death, no.''
	   Asked if he had a message for police, the man replied: ``I wish
them luck and I hope that the day they catch me they detain me and
kill me.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The catalytic cracking unit of the state oil and
gas company Pertamina's refinery in Balongan, West Java, is
expected to resume operation early next month after almost a
month-long stoppage.
	   The residue catalytic cracking (RCC) unit, which produces
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and Premium, Super TT and Premix
gasoline, ceased operation May 11 due to technical failures.
	   Designed with a processing capacity of 125,000 barrels per day,
has another production unit, the refinery has another crude
distillation unit (CDU). This remains in operation to produce
naptha, kerosene, automotive diesel oil and low sulfuric wax
residue (LSWR).
	   ``We hope the RCC unit will resume operation early next month,''
company processing director Samto Utomo told The Jakarta Post and
Bisnis Indonesia.
	   The US$2.4 billion Balongan refinery has attracted unwanted
media attention due its repeated production problems.
	   Its RCC unit is guaranteed by its designer, U.S. designing and
engineering company Universal Oil Product, to be able to operate
full time for two years before a 40-day break.
	   But the unit has twice experienced mechanical failures over the
past four months even though its last periodic break was in
February 1997.
	   Sources at Pertamina attribute the repeated failures to
substandard construction. They said Pertamina officials used low
quality construction materials but marked up prices to meet the
project value of $2.4 billion.
	   ``We hope the Attorney General's Office will investigate the
corruption at the refinery,'' the sources said.
	   They estimated the actual cost of the refinery at less than $1.9
billion.
	   Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto has ordered
Pertamina to conduct technical auditing of the refinery.
	   Samto said Pertamina was currently reexamining the RCC unit's
design together with Universal Oil and the British Petroleum.

<TEXT>
	   WHERE is the market headed? How can we prepare to change with it
to meet our customers' needs? These are arguably the two most vital
questions for a business to answer and act upon.
	   In today's business environment, it is vital to be able to
anticipate trends correctly and consistently. Moreover, a business
has to establish suitable procedures for handling them. Stand out
and stay afloat.
	   In Pathways to Agility: Mass Customization in Action (John Wiley
 Sons, 263 pages), John D. Oleson shows us how to deliver
strategies for applying these concepts of agility.
	   The first section, Industrial Direction - Agility and Mass
Customization, goes into the history and background of agility. The
author defines what he means by agility: ``the ability to respond
with ease to unexpected but anticipated events''. He attempts to
illustrate it in action in specific circumstances. He describes the
necessary strategic changes to put agility and mass customisation
into operation.
	   Chapter 1 provides a fascinating historical overview of how
humanity has evolved, and the part which agility has played. As we
have evolved from hunter-gatherers to farmers to knowledge workers,
so the ever-present uncertainty has shifted from nature's impact
(notwithstanding El Nino) to market variations.
	   Mass production technology lasted more than half a century,
resulting in the highest productivity in the industrialised world.
That was until Toyota's production system revolutionised the
approach to manufacturing with what is now known as lean
production. This took time to take root in the West, but still
continues to be the wave of industrial improvement.
	   Not for much longer, though. The next wave, according to Oleson,
involves agility and mass customisation.
	   Yet agility is not new - it can be seen in all stages of
industrialisation, from the crafts worker to mass, lean and now
custom manufacturing. In a way, we will be reverting to crafts
workers, adapting products to customer requirements. And agility
will continue to be key in the drive towards mass customisation.
	   The author is adamant: ``This ability to agilely and speedily
adapt the product to customer needs is a capability that must be
developed.'' Why?
	   ``The success of the firm is at stake so remedy must be swift.''
Oleson quotes Motorola as a company which realised early on the
benefits of a shift to agility. It saw ``the shadow of the
gallows'' lengthening. Now rapid change and six sigma quality are a
part of its culture, as is training.
	   Yet how many companies will be able to practise this? I recently
queried a bill from a well-known service provider. I was told that
there was only one customer service person who could deal with my
enquiry, but that she was on M.C. When I called back later in the
week she was on leave. Next time she had ``just stepped out''.
(Don't you just love that phrase? It covers so many eventualities,
from a trip to the loo to an extended breakfast.) Next time she was
in a meeting with the CEO. I was left in no doubt that the CEO was
more important than customers. When I did finally get to speak to
her, my simple request for a refund was met with: ``It's not our
company policy.''
	   This is not a company that responds with ease to the expected,
let alone the unexpected. And it is not an isolated case. Customer
focus and responsiveness? Fahgeddabardit. Agility? Fragility, more
like.
	   But Section 2, Operational Agility and Mass Customization,
provided the key to understanding how to apply agility to an
organisation's operations.
	   Build the capability and the operational support to respond
quickly to change. Central to this is the supply chain. But how
does it operate, and what practices do you need to change to
improve effectiveness? Optimise use of material, information and
cash.
	   What role does Oleson see for technology in all this? Integrated
information systems - a vital element in operating an extended
supply chain - is the subject of Chapter 5. We learn how electronic
interchange along the supply chain allows it to operate as one
entity. Chapter 7 is particularly valuable in demonstrating the
support given by automation.
	   Section 3 covers the needs of new processes, products and
markets in the context of changing capability in the modern
enterprise. Here it began to get too technical for me, so I skimmed
onwards.
	   The final section gets to the crux of the matter, that is
pathways to agility and the change process, emphasising people.
Even relationships, it seems, must be agile for a firm to function
effectively.
	   Drawing on the experiences of a broad variety of companies,
Oleson succeeds in his intention of bridging the concept and the
practice of agility in the industrial context. The pathway metaphor
is very useful in following what an industrial firm should do to
integrate agility properly into its activities.
	   It helps to read the book with a view to how you would interpret
the concepts in relation to your own company's processes and
context. The principles apply to most situations, as the author
says. Although he looks at manufacturing, the lessons are
applicable to whichever trade we are in.
	   Obviously, though, manufacturing managers and engineers will
find these pathways of most value.
	   All the same, I found some of Oleson's case studies, individual
perspectives and benchmarks extremely interesting. The chapter on
processes, for example, contains an account of how the German
company Porsche used Japanese methods to become a world-class
manufacturer of defect-free cars.
	   Similarly, the chapter on products sets out examples of
standards of customer satisfaction. These are standards which
others will one day have to follow, e.g Levi Strauss and its
personal fit jeans.
	   And plenty more instances which held out a dream of customer
service - involving employees, integrating computers, and including
automation: ``Telephone communication is with people who truly are
service oriented ...''; ``friendly and no-hassle service''; ``There
is no question that these companies are working to have satisfied
customers''. I awoke from the dream to the reality of the enraging
``service'' provider: ``She's - not - in. Call back later.''
	   Compelling and concise, however, Oleson is not. The dense text,
overly- long paragraphs and uninspiring graphics see to that. He
competently explains agility basics and, commendably, ends each
chapter with a summary of what has just gone, and what will be
following. However, ``This chapter discussed ...'' and ``The next
chapter deals with ...'' are repeated ad nauseam.
	   Top marks for agility in manufacturing industry, but not quite
agile enough in writing for the general reading public.
	   The second book under review this week is a veritable tome.
Fifteen chapters and 520 pages make International MA, Joint
Ventures and Beyond (John Wiley  Sons) a formidable piece of work.
Being a source of information on ``the globalisation of the deal
process'' it is heavy content, heavyweight.
	   Indeed, it is intended for corporate principals, legal and
financial advisers, government officials, investment and commercial
bankers, and business school professors.
	   Authors David J. BenDaniel and Arthur H. Rosenbloom intend it to
be a roadmap, and you don't have to read roadmaps from beginning to
end. So, as I scanned the contents page I decided to look around
`Human Resource Issues in International Mergers and Acquisitions'.
In this chapter, Russell H. Demers cites the value of current
employees' inherent knowledge, skills and expertise. What if, as a
result of a merger, you lose their motivation and commitment? A
terribly undervalued factor in the race to restructure.
	   Demers argues in favour of involving the human resource team
from the outset. What are the expectations for the venture? For
change to meet business plans? For staffing needs?
	   He looks at issues to consider in the pre-acquisition evaluation
-issues which relate to the partnership, local and company culture,
government regulations and availability of necessary
infrastructure. He then goes on to discuss staffing strategy,
compensation, and integration of personnel information systems. He
finishes with a succinct round-up of support mechanisms -
communication, training, acculturation and staff morale.
	   As is so often the case, though, a degree of cultural bias
prevails. For example, the guidelines for a post-transition
assessment assume the merger or acquisition is between a United
States and a non-US company. Also, a detailed checklist has
``pending lawsuits'' prominently featured as an issue relating to
the target company.
	   On the other hand, the final chapter, on post-merger
integration, highlights cultural differences between the US and
other cultures and how this affects management issues. The
checklist, too, concisely encapsulates factors to consider
regarding national and organisational culture.
	   Apart from Human Resources Issues and Postmerger Integration,
which are treated as ``Special Topics'', BenDaniel and Rosenbloom's
contributors range over Critical Issues in Planning and
Implementation, Valuing Companies and Negotiating Transactions, and
Joint Ventures, as well as Legal, Financial, Accounting and Tax
Aspects.
	   Growing numbers of companies, including middle-market and
smaller ones, are looking outward at transactions beyond their
national borders. This trend will definitely continue. At the same
time, the need to work through the complications and ``potential
deal stoppers'' associated with cross- border transactions will
become more of an issue. In helping readers around these pitfalls,
this book proves to be the real deal.

	   THE Government may finance 60 per cent of the capital
requirements of the Asset Management Company which will be set up
soon to manage non-performing loans in banks and finance companies,
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said.
	   The Prime Minister said the Government expected the rest to be
financed by the private sector.
	   He said this in response to a question from the Press after
speaking at a symposium on ``Revitalisation of the Japanese Economy
and the Future of Asia'' at the Okura Hotel yesterday.
	   Asked whether the Government would draw on taxes or Bank Negara,
he said financing would ``come from the Consolidated Fund''.
	   ``Anyway, we have some money,'' he said.
	   On the possibility of raising part of the funds by issuing
government bonds, Dr Mahathir replied: ``We have not decided on
that.''
	   Earlier, during a question-and-answer session after his address,
Dr Mahathir was drawn to the AMC when a participant asked him about
Malaysia still looking East, lessons to be learnt from Japan's
mistakes and the percentage of Malaysia's non-performing loans in
June last year, just before the region's ``bubble'' burst.
	   He was also asked about Malaysia's stand on recommendations of
the International Monetary Fund for the troubled economies of East
Asia.
	   Dr Mahathir said in handling Malaysia's banking system problem,
the country actually ``looked very far East'' to the United States
given that Japan did not handle this problem very well.
	   He said Malaysia decided to take the NPLs out of the system in
the way the US did so that banks could get on with their
operations.
	   Dr Mahathir also said Malaysia did not do the same thing as
Indonesia, which had to close 16 banks in compliance with IMF
conditions.
	   He said taking action against one troubled bank was not an
isolated thing in a banking system.
	   ``You mishandle one bank's problem and we will have a whole
banking system problem.''
	   Dr Mahathir said in Malaysia's case, the Government took
measures to prevent the collapse of the banking system.
	   On Malaysia's seeming compliance with IMF policies, Dr Mahathir
said: ``Frankly, we feel threatened'' and added that if it did not
comply with certain conditions, then the country's currency would
depreciate further.
	   ``We try to follow (the IMF's conditions), but it is very
damaging to us.''
	   Dr Mahathir cited having to increase interest rates, a standard
formula for troubled countries, which could lead to companies going
bankrupt.
	   ``When companies go bankrupt, the Government will eventually go
bankrupt because we depend on corporate taxes in order to sustain
us. So while we do follow the IMF, we are very hesitant about going
the full way.''
	   He said some IMF conditions, like opening up markets would hurt
the economy and bring it to a standstill.
	   Dr Mahathir said he understood why ``some people are now
criticising the IMF'', adding that there was basis for fearing the
``medicine doled out by the IMF''.
	   He remarked that although the patient was very sick and in need
of medicine, ``some medicine would kill''.
	   ``And I am speaking as a doctor,'' he said to applause.
	   He was also asked where he derived confidence that an
international financial system could successfully deal with the
financial crisis in the region given his strong views about the
IMF's prescription.
	   Dr Mahathir replied that he got this confidence from ``history''
from the time after the Bretton Woods agreement was drawn up that
helped regulate exchange rates which in turn helped countries like
Japan and Germany rebuild and prosper.
	   In the wake of this, the world economy prospered too as the
exchange rates of currencies stabilised.
	   ``That is until people decided to be more competitive and
started to fiddle with exchange rates.''
	   He said it was ``most important'' to remove the ``very violent
fluctuation in the exchange rate where a currency could move from
100 per cent devaluation to 600 per cent''.
	   ``You become bankrupt. Do we want to bankrupt the world?
Certainly not.
	   If we can find a formula to reduce the volatility in the
exchange rate, I am quite sure the world will recover.''

	   SANG TAHANAN (The Prisoner, 1997, 365 pages) appeared a week
after its author, Abdullah Tahir, died in 1997. However, he managed
to check the proofs, even help improve the cover. In this
collection of 21 short stories, Abdullah reveals fragments of
himself with wit, courage, even self-irony.
	   In `Tokoh', he portrays a middle-aged literary activist who
reluctantly accepts the status of tokoh that young people have
bestowed upon him.
	   Holding an administrative post at a university, he plans to
write a massive memoir and a first-rate novel.
	   So highly is he regarded that he is often swarmed with
invitations to give ceramah, called to testify in court over
copyright cases, interviewed for his literary judgment. Over time,
his remarks show a discernible slant. He praises young writers whom
he expects to praise him in return.
	   This leads to a charge being thrown at him in one of his well
attended ceramah by a resentful young scribe who also accuses him
of failing to heed his own words of advice.
	   Humiliated, the tokoh, who has written nothing in the last 20
years, replies that people should follow what he says, not what he
has (not) done. And with wounded pride, he promises to write his
great novel about the struggles of a family spanning three
generations, something along the lines of Marquez's One Hundred
Years of Solitude.
	   However, upon retiring, the tokoh is at a loss as to what to do
with his time. Restless, despondent, he drives around aimlessly,
spends hours reading newspapers and watching TV. Still, he refuses
to admit that his creative juice has dried up. The typewriter on
his desk is a painful sight to behold.
	   Once, after the subuh prayer, he is miraculously inspired and
starts hitting the keys as ideas pour forth. He works so hard that
he finally collapses due to exhaustion, compounded by the symptoms
of the Dreaded Triple: diabetes, heart disease, high blood
pressure. Before he dies, he tells his story to someone who
promises to write the masterpiece for him.
	   `Terperangkap' exposes the world of unscrupulous publishing. A
tauke relentlessly pursues a cikgu to produce a couple of
bestselling manuscripts, to be published immediately, bound and
printed in Singapore, quality guaranteed. The Cikgu is reluctant to
commit himself because he is trying to finish a teenage love novel
for another publisher who is involved in a project sponsored by the
World Bank, of which 8,000 copies would be bought outright and
distributed free to school libraries.
	   The Cikgu has already finished three novels, 140 pages each, now
in the hands of another publisher who is honest, clean, and who
pays royalties promptly. He is also editing a book of stories by
women which he hopes would be included in the World Bank project.
And because he is an established writer, the Cikgu's books sell
very well - KBSR, notes on required reading, textbooks, exercise
books, collections of short stories, novels - bringing in so much
money that he is compelled to hire an accountant to help him fill
his income tax forms.
	   Famous for producing pornography, the Tauke promises the Cikgu
that he will print 10,000 copies of his novels. He has reprinted
the Cikgu's books originally brought out by other publishers; one
has gone through 14 printings. There is already a Standing Order
for 5,000 copies. The Tauke insists that the Cikgu's books would be
clean, a promise the Cikgu is sceptical about. A day before, the
Cikgu had received an anonymous letter from someone charging the
Tauke of swindling his stable of writers.
	   Realising he is getting nowhere, the Tauke uses his good-looking
secretary to deal with the Cikgu. Soon the Tauke gets the two
manuscripts.
	   Printed in Segambut on cheap newsprint, the Cikgu's novels have
been mutilated with heavy sex scenes. Furious, the Cikgu rushes to
the Tauke's office, ready to burn it down. But he is received by
the alluring secretary whose job is to cool him down in the secret
hideaway with a door remotely controlled.
	   Pettiness in Malay politics catches Abdullah's attention.
`Broker' tells of disagreement between Salim and Mat over whether
the village should be levelled to make way for an industrial zone.
Salim is in favour while Mat is not. By selling five hectares of
his own dusun land, Salim makes tons of money. Mat has no land to
speak of but his argument is that once a village is wiped out,
there is no replacement. And what is a Malay without his kampung?
	   At the warung, Salim would belanja the people from the nearby
villages nasi lemak, roti canai and kueh-mueh to promote himself as
a generous leader who can count on being elected to the branch
committee of the ruling dominant party. Believing that Salim's
money is haram, Mat joins a peripheral party, whose bosses swoop
down from Kuala Lumpur to officiate the opening of a branch office
in the village.
	   With such backing, Mat calls a meeting that is well attended
because on the agenda is the issue of how to become millionaire. As
a middle man, Salim charges between two and five per cent
commission on land sold to the Japanese and Korean multinationals.
Soon he is the proud owner of the one and only Honda Accord in the
village.
	   Quietly Mat induces one Encik Wong to invest, becoming a broker
who charges only 0.5 per cent. Many who have signed up with Salim
leave him and deal with Mat instead. But in the end, a new Menteri
Besar cancels the whole project, leaving everybody back in square
one.
	   A very complicated family relation is told in `Tukmak', about a
pious old mother who knows the dispositions of her sons, daughter,
in-laws, grandchildren all too well. Of them all, she loves Li the
most, the son who is taciturn, dominated by a fiery wife Nik, a
spendthrift with expensive tastes who is critical of other people's
slightest indiscretions.
	   When Tukmak's daughter, Yam, is about to have an operation,
Tukmak is flown to Kuala Lumpur, bringing with her a sack of rice,
a box of spices, a bundle of dried fish, 14 pounds of glutinous
rice, to be served during the special kenduri to pray for Yam's
recovery.
	   Upon arrival at Yam's house, Tukmak notices that no one is
waiting to greet her. She bears the slight with motherly dignity.
Li and his wife Nik drop by only the day after. Arrogant, Nik does
not even bother to ask how her mother-in-law is or shake her hands.
	   Li wants to stay five minutes longer to perform his maghrib but
Nik signals Li to leave immediately. At the gate, Tukmak hands Li
one wrapper of his favourite marinated fish, and asks him to
deliver another wrapper of rice to Aya, Tukmak's adopted son, who
could only come in a day or two.
	   Nik's reaction is that Tukmak favours Aya more than her own sons
or daughters.
	   Tukmak likes Aya because he is very respectful. During the last
Ramadan, Aya presented Tukmak with a gold ring as a token of his
love and loyalty.
	   Tukmak was quick to let everybody know. Insulted, Nik gave only
a piece of batik and 10 ringgit.
	   After Yam's successful operation, Tukmak falls sick, and she
lets on that her soul has already been knocking her gullet, ready
to depart.
	   `Dendam' is a surreal story about a murder in which the
characters are named after their roles. The victim is Wanita Muda
who soon changes to Wanita Mangsa, then there are the Penganu and
Pencerita, the narrator. In between scenes, there are directorial
commands: Cut. Retake. The author gets in the actors' minds and
records the victim's final monologue as she studies the knife
buried in her chest.
	   The line between illusion and reality is obliterated. Penganu
wonders if the victim is showing signs of narcissism, admiring the
beauty of her own pain. Or could he himself be the next victim, the
result of revenge. The narrative is far from clear: ``Tidaklah
terfikir wanita Mangsa akan menggunakan senjata yang sama dan cara
yang sama untuk pertama berlaku adil, dan kedua untuk membalas
dendam, atau cara ketiga untuk membuat satu sejarah tragedi yang
akan dikenang atau akan meniti dari bibir ke bibir generasi akan
datang berabad-abad lamanya.''
	   Finally, the director reviews the film on the screen. He sees an
endless stretch of blanks, and orders an immediate retake. Perhaps
Abdullah is naughtily spoofing people who hold that reality
imitates art. What is being imitated, or whoever is doing the
imitation, doesn't matter, because in the end life is nothing,
nada.
	   `Sang Tahanan' is the mindless monologue of a remand prisoner
mulling over the death of his lover. He addresses his perceptions
of the events to the judge, the jury, lawyers, clerks, and other
members of the court. He stands as the accused, his own defence
lawyer, and his own witness. He claims that she is the one who is
guilty of murder. Her weapon is this string of words: ``Tomorrow is
today, actually.''
	   He argues that compared to the knife he had stuck in the woman's
heart, her words are deadlier. He doubts there is justice in the
world because he suffers more than she. His knife killed her
instantly but the sting of her words stay. Pleading leniency, he
claims to have had enough dignity to give her a proper burial, a
factor the jury must consider before making the verdict.
	   Many of these stories are hard to follow because the voice of
the author and that of his characters are at odds. At times, the
reader is unsure who is speaking. A thick fog of miscellaneous and
unrelated details delays many endings. The impressive descriptions
and tough prose are overshadowed by concern for atmosphere.
Abdullah indulges in little diversions, useless anecdotes,
unfocused dialogue. Things get repeated, too, due to verbal
zealousness.

	   THE notion that ``West is best'' comes under question in
Khadijah Hashim's 19th and latest novel, Mencari Azizah.
	   Her premise of a young woman of mixed parentage who heads for
America in search of her missing father, and her identity, is
anchored in the culture of two continents. The divergent threads
are then knotted with the challenges facing a woman careening
towards the 21st century.
	   The seed for Mencari Azizah was sown in Iowa in 1995, during a
three-month writing fellowship. Khadijah's stay opened the window
to life as it is lived on the street, not the screen, and made her
rethink values expounded by the likes of Dallas, Dynasty and
Chicago Hope.
	   ``Asians' view of life in the US is coloured by television and
the movies. In reality, there are good and bad things which we can
imitate or reject.
	   ``Our mistake lies in assuming that everything from the West is
good. So much so that we are ashamed of what we have, and will not
admit it could be better than theirs. We should not hesitate to say
- `This is our heritage. It's good and we appreciate it.'''
	   On this note, Khadijah feels that the emphasis on buying local
should extend to Malaysian literature. Readers hesitate to spend
RM10 on a book by, say, a local laureate, but readily fork out
double that amount for a foreign title, she observes.
	   ``We need to change this attitude. A country's reserves and
economic strength do not reflect how civilised it is. The better
measures are the quality of its writing and the excellence of its
arts and culture, which determine the identity of a race.''
	   Since Iowa, Khadijah has brought out a novel (Fasa Kedua) and a
book of pantun (808 Pantun Baru), released under `K' Publishing.
She is working on an expanded edition of the latter, to be called
1001 Pantun Baru.
	   There are no deadlines for this author, who prefers to mull over
images and meanings, giving them time to gel. This slow-and-steady
approach applies to her research, which can stretch longer than the
three months she takes to complete a book.
	   ``I need everything to be there so I won't be stuck once I start
writing.''
	   She also takes pains over authenticity, based on her belief that
fiction must rest on fact to withstand scrutiny.
	   ``For Mencari Azizah, I collected pamphlets on Iowa and Chicago,
and information on ticket prices, places and distances. All these
are important to draw people to a story. My books may be fiction
but I take facts from here and there.''
	   Khadijah considers her job well done when readers ask, ``Is that
a real story?'' On that basis, she does not place much store by
what the literary critics have to say about her writing.

	   The tough measures that the RBI took to protect the rupee have
been partially rolled back, bringing relief to bankers It was the
16th day of the first month of circa 1998. The country's apex
banker, the redoubtable Bimal Jalan, made his toughest move to
check the falling rupee. The Reserve Bank announced that the bank
and repo rates would be hiked by 200 basis points each to 11 and 9
per cent, respectively. What's more, the banks' cash reserve ratio
(CRR) requirement was pushed up by 50 basis points to 10.5 per
cent. These measures managed to contain the rupee at Rs39 against
the dollar. Though currency rates settled, bank chiefs were
genuinely unsettled. For, the RBI's action caused yields on
government securities to go up by over 200 basis points to
considerably depreciating the banks' gilt investment portfolio.
	   The RBI, for fiscal 1997-98, increased the banks' mark-to-market
valuation of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirements to 70
per cent of their portfolio investments instead of 60 per cent a
year back. Besides, on an aggregate year-end deposit of
approximately Rs5,85,000 crore, an SLR provisioning of around
Rs1,46,250 crore would have to be made. According to an estimate by
I-Sec, the banking sector's actual SLR portfolio is much higher, in
the region of Rs1,82,000 crore. As a result, banks, which were all
set for windfall profits from this portfolio valuation till early
December 1997, suddenly faced the prospect of a loss of over Rs
1,500 crore on gilts thanks to the rupee rescue operation.
	   Says Ashish Pitale, who heads the fixed income research wing of
ICICI Securities and Finance Company (I- Sec), ``The net increase
in the banks' holding of government securities till 16 January was
around Rs26,000 crore. While, for example, they acquired the
ten-year government papers at a coupon rate of 10.08 per cent in
October 1997, thanks to the RBI action, the yields firmed up to 13
per cent in January suddenly translating into a notional loss of
Rs1,350 crore for banks. There was another Rs160-crore loss on
account of depreciation in PSU bond investments of around Rs4,000
crore.''
	   The RBI governor justified the measures as necessary for
protecting the rupee from the currency speculators, following the
turmoil in South-east Asia. He promised that the measures were
purely temporary in nature, to be rolled back once the storm in the
forex market was over. And now that Jalan has kept his word to some
extent, the banks suddenly find themselves once more in the black.
After the rupee remained static at Rs 39 for three consecutive
months, on 17 March, the RBI brought down the repo rate by one
percentage point to 8 per cent. On 18 March, the bank rate came
down by 50 basis points to 10.50 per cent. On 23 March, Jalan made
his intentions clearer by reducing the CRR by 50 basis points in
two phases to 10 per cent. While a 25-basis point cut will be
effective from 28 March, the second tranche of an equal reduction
will take effect from 11 April.
	   Sudden gains The CRR cut increased the lendable funds in the
banks' kitty by a total Rs2,600 crore. This, coupled with a lower
repo rate, moved the yields on government securities southwards in
the secondary market. And that is when the gilts portfolio began to
appreciate. Bank chiefs, who sulked in January anticipating losses
on their investments, turned euphoric on the last day of 1997-98.
That the ecstasy will last long was confirmed when the RBI did not
alter the list of gilts put on its purchase-sales window -- which
is part of its open market operations (OMO) -- on 24 March.
	   The yield to maturity (YTM) for the ten-year papers suggested
that all the ten-year stock is likely to be pegged at around 12.15
per cent. Bankers say that the RBI gave two signals in the last
week of March for a mark-to-market valuation. On 24 March, the RBI
apparently decided that the OMO list would be kept unaltered till
31 March, which was a little surprising considering the fact that
the first phase of CRR cut, effective from 28 March, would have
released Rs1,300 crore in the banking system. And the RBI showed no
intention of mopping this up.
	   Secondly, on 26 March, the government privately placed Rs 6,000
crore worth of government stocks with the RBI. Six-year papers
worth Rs4,000 crore were placed at a coupon rate of 11.57 per cent
along with a ten-year paper worth Rs2,000 crore at a coupon of
12.15 per cent. ``Interestingly,'' says S.R. Kamath, deputy general
manager, Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI), ``the YTMs
to both the papers fitted in the yield-curve announced on 24 March.
That was a signal sent out by the RBI that the yields to the gilts
on the OMO list were indicative of the valuation of banks' gilt
portfolios. Says Pitale, ``If the YTMs indicated on 24 March are
considered to be a benchmark for valuation, then the banks would
stand to book a bumper profit of over Rs 5,100 crore in their gilt
portfolio apart from a few hundred crores on account of other SLR
securities.''
	   But banks take the RBI governor's year-end bonus with a pinch of
salt as they feel that the apex bank is more concerned with the
government's borrowing programme for the next fiscal than the
banking sector. The RBI governor, bankers say, has been stingy
while promising to roll back the stringent measures. According to
the October 1997 Monetary Policy, the CRR should have been 8 per
cent by 28 March, whereas it still remains as high as 10.25 per
cent. Likewise, the bank rate was 9 per cent before it was hiked to
11 per cent, and despite a reduction it stands at 10.5 per cent. To
top it all, the repo rate was at 5 per cent on 2 December, 1997 --
the actual period of commencement of the retrograde measures -- and
it is 8 per cent now. ''This,'' according to a senior executive in
a foreign bank, ''clearly shows that the measures were
half-hearted.'' Although they have come as a blessing for the
banks, the bottomline is that Jalan, in his bid to make the
borrowing programme cheaper for the centre, is moving the rates
down, according to some bankers.
	   Says B.S. Raghutham, head of money market, Global Trust Bank,
``What is required at the moment is status quo before the new
borrowing programme begins next fiscal. This will vindicate the
RBI's position that the measures were purely temporary.''
	   Case for a CRR cut In the interim budget announced by Yashwant
Sinha on 25 March, the Centre has programmed market borrowings of
Rs 86,000 crore for 1998-99 vis-a-vis its actual borrowing of Rs
64,563 crore in 1997-98 against a gross borrowing target of Rs
55,899 crore. Moreover, the finance minister's announcement of
increasing the expenditure on large infrastructure projects will
only make funds for corportaes more scarce unless the RBI resorts
to further CRR cuts.
	   A quick calculation supports this. Aggregate deposits stood at
around Rs5,05,000 as on 31 March, 1997, and is slated to be around
Rs5,85,000 crore -- an estimated increase of Rs 80,000 crore. Even
assuming that the deposits grow by an equal amount in 1998-99, the
government's claim will be Rs86,000 crore, leaving hardly any
leftover for industry. Explains Pitale of I-Sec, ``Last year, banks
accounted for a major portion of investments in corporate papers.
But the government's borrowing programme will take away most of the
bank funds at low rates, which will result in another credit
off-take problem unless the RBI undertakes a massive CRR cut.''
	   April is always the cruelest month for banks when the Centre
kick-starts its market borrowing programme, taking away a huge
chunk of its lendable resources. This year the banking system would
be flush with liquidity, as apart from the Rs2,600 crore released
on account of CRR cuts, a further Rs9,000 crore would move into the
banks' coffers on account of CRR interest, treasury bills and
government stock redemptions, and interest thereon. But all this is
expected to be sucked away by the government's borrowing machine.
	   Meanwhile, a section of bankers defend Jalan's cautious reversal
of measures. The RBI has the task of containing the broad money
supply (M3) growth rate at 15 to 15.5 per cent, which is hovering
around 16 per cent in mid-March. Any further reduction in CRR in
this fiscal will expand the M3, resulting in an upward pressure on
the inflation rate. Even the RBI governor's attempts at raising
money from the market at a low interest rate is justifiable as a
high interest rate would only increase the repayment burden in
subsequent years, says a senior official of a nationlised bank.
	   Which means that Jalan, with all the control he enjoys over the
economic future of the country, would have to ensure that he gives
adequate support to industry and banks as well in fiscal 1998-99.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian economy will continue to contract
and will bottom-out this year before the first green shoots of the
recovery spring up next year, but pre-crisis growth rates will not
be recovered until 2002, economists predict.
	   Mari E. Pangestu, executive director of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, forecast yesterday that the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink by between 10 percent and
20 percent this year.
	   The industrial sector is expected to contract by 10 percent to
12 percent this year, the service sector by between seven percent
and 10 percent, while the agricultural sector is expected to grow
by 0.5 percent.
	   She predicted that the economy would remain stagnant next year
while the country held a general election, and would register
annual growth of 2 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in 2001.
	   ``So, we need at least five years to return to the level real
GDP was at in 1997,'' Mari said at a media conference on the
economic outlook in the Pacific region held by the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC).
	   Suhadi Mangkusubroto, a PECC economist, predicted that
Indonesia's economy would contract by 4.5 percent and inflation
would rise to 32 percent during this year.
	   However, he said the effects of major political and social
unrest or other destabilizing forces had not been included in the
analysis and the forecasts were therefore no longer valid. The
forecasts were last revised in March when Soeharto was still in
power, he added.
	   ``The situation now is much worse than a few months ago when the
analysis was carried out. Therefore all of our forecasts are
inaccurate. For the time being, we should rely on the Central
Bureau of Statistics projections for growth and inflation,'' Suhadi
said.
	   The bureau predicted on Monday that the country's GDP would
contract by 10.1 percent and inflation would soar to 80 to 85
percent this year.
	   Raden Pardede, a senior economist with state-owned Danareksa
Sekuritas, told The Jakarta Post yesterday that the bureau's
projections for economic growth and inflation were still too
optimistic.
	   ``I think our economy could contract by as much as 20 percent
this year with inflation surpassing the 85 percent level projected
by the bureau,'' he said.
	   He said the economy would continue to contract because levels of
domestic and foreign investment were still declining.
	   Domestic investment would continue to fall because of high
interest rates and a decline in the savings rate to 18 percent from
30 percent two years ago, he explained. Foreign investment is
continuing to avoid Indonesia because of the all-pervading
uncertainty in the country.
	   Raden said inflation could surpass the 85 percent level because
the central bank would have to print more money, employers would
face pressure to raise wages, their product prices would continue
to rise and the rupiah would further weaken.
	   Suhadi said the current situation resembled the dire economic
circumstances of 1966/1967 after the fall of the country's first
president Sukarno.
	   ``It is very similar to the situation in 1966/67 when we could
not finance our development programs. The government did not even
have enough money to finance routine spending,'' Suhadi said.
	   Luckily, he said, the government received soft loans from
friendly countries to help see them through those difficult years.
	   Suhadi suggested that the government work closely with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) so that the agency would quickly
approve disbursement of loans to the country, which would in turn
encourage friendly countries to grant Indonesia further bilateral
aid.
	   ``Only with foreign loans will the government be able to finance
its operation, continue subsidies and stimulate the economy,'' he
said.
	   Miranda S. Goeltom, a Bank Indonesia director, agreed with
Suhadi's suggestion and said the government would use some of the
funds available to help existing businesses to expand.

	   TRAFFIC from Shah Alam may be barred from entering Subang Jaya
at the KFC access as a long-term measure to reduce congestion in
the housing estate.
	   Subang Jaya State Assemblyman Lee Hwa Beng said while the
existing closure schedule of 6am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm at the KFC
access had effectively reduced congestion, the problem returned
once the road was re-opened.
	   ``But after the closure period, the jam worsens as motorists
from Shah Alam pile into Jalan Tujuan the moment the access road is
re-opened.
	   ``I have suggested to the MPSJ that we bar traffic from Shah
Alam from entering Subang Jaya via the access near the KFC exit
permanently.
	   Motorists will have to use alternative routes,'' he said.
	   Lee said although he expected to receive objections from Shah
Alam motorists, the move was necessary to ease congestion in Subang
Jaya.
	   He said since Jalan Tujuan had been being upgraded to three
lanes and there were only two lanes at the exit to the Federal
Highway, the closure would give Subang Jaya motorists a permanent
extra lane.
	   The MPSJ implemented the twice daily closure on March 16.
	   Motorists have been using alternative routes such as from Batu
Tiga to Jalan Kewajipan via the North-South-Central Link to join
the Shah Alam Expressway, leaving at the Jalan Kewajipan
Interchange to Subang Jaya.
	   The closure was to reduce the strain on the Subang Jaya exit
which was forced to bear the extra traffic load from Bandar Sunway
and Subang Indah and the southern portion of Subang Jaya after the
closure of the Motorola junction at Bandar Sunway late last year.
	   The closure is expected to be in force until the project to
upgrade the KFC exit is completed next year.
	   Some 800 to 1,000 cars enter the access from Shah Alam but there
are 250,000 households in Subang Jaya, USJ and Bandar Sunway.
	   This means there are about 30,000 to 40,000 cars heading out of
the exit at peak periods.
	   Jalan Tujuan is being upgraded from two lanes to three on each
side and resurfaced.
	   The project should be completed by next month.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Pas Youth today urged the Anti-Corruption
Agency and the Attorney-General's Chambers to speed up
investigations against former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Muhammad Muhammad Taib.
	   Pas Youth vice-chief Mahfuz Omar said although Muhammad had been
acquitted by the Brisbane District Court, the issue in question was
the ``extra-ordinary'' amount of wealth accumulated by him.
	   He said even though Muhammad had resigned as Menteri Besar, the
wealth accumulated by him and his family members took place during
his term of office.
	   ``The fact that we only got to know of Muhammad's wealth after
it was brought up in the Australian court showed the agency had
been very slow in taking action,'' he said.
	   Speaking at a Press conference, Mahfuz said an initial report
was lodged with the Selangor ACA in Shah Alam on Dec 28, 1996.
	   He said a police report on the matter was also lodged with the
Dang Wangi Police Station on Jan 2, last year but no action was
taken.
	   The reports, he said, were lodged after Muhammad was charged
with falsely declaring money he took into Australia in December
1996 and failing to declare more than AS$1.2 million (RM2.9
million) when he left the country.
	   Muhammad had admitted that the money which he failed to declare
at the Brisbane airport while enroute to New Zealand belonged to
his three brothers, Datuk Raduan, Datuk Othman and Hassan.
	   On the same issue, DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang said in a
statement that the Cabinet in its weekly meeting tomorrow should
discuss the inordinate delay by the ACA and the A-G's office to
probe Muhammad.
	   ``Last year, Malaysians were led to believe that with the
passing of a new Anti-Corruption Act, the Government has a new
political commitment to launch an all-out war against corruption
which should have been strengthened by the Asian economic problem
in the past year,'' he said.
	   Lim said Malaysians were disappointed with newspaper reports
that the corruption probe on Muhammad ``has got nowhere'' with the
ACA and the A-G's Chambers passing the buck to one another.
	   Lim said the A-G, Tan Sri Mohtar Abdullah should be mindful that
Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had said yesterday
that the people in the region were demanding greater
accountability, transparency and a say in decision making
processes.

	   TIMIKA, Irian Jaya (JP): Possibly, probably, maybe, perhaps and
more such words and sentences that indicate anything but solid
certainty. If you were to read an account on Irian Jaya's
background, say, as a foreword to a more detailed essay on that
part of the island of New Guinea, you would notice that it rather
teems with such words: probably 200 languages; some 1,800 species
of insects; perhaps most are barely unknown; maybe this, possibly
that.
	   Will Irian Jaya ever be fully revealed? Of course, but your
guess is just as good as anyone else's as to when this will occur.
	   A lot is already known about Indonesia's easternmost province,
but there is vastly more that is not, and it covers practically
every aspect of the place: flora, fauna, customs, people, their
languages. Did you know that as recently as 1987 two
never-before-known groups of people emerged out of isolation? Who
is to say that these are the last ethnic groups in Irian Jaya to
step out of the jungle?
	   Yet New Guinea has not escaped the notice of the world outside.
There exist accounts from the distant past of some of the products
of the island such as seafood, medicinal bark, plumes of the birds
of paradise and other things, which made their way to other parts
of Indonesia as well as China and even France.
	   But apart from a vague ``from the far east'', those on the
receiving end could not be expected to have a clear picture of
products' place of origin. Trade has been going on for quite a long
time, as did some mixing between native Irianese and ethnic groups
from other parts of Indonesia. But, by and large, the island
remained an enigma for quite a long time.
	   Gradually, however, the shrouds of mystery began to lift, not
least because of the voyages from Western countries -- Portugal in
particular --that started about halfway through the second
millennium. The purpose of these voyages in Indonesia is well
known: the Spice Islands. New Guinea then became a more concrete
entity to these seafarers from Portugal (and later, the English,
Spanish and Dutch), but though it loomed large in the region,
attention was focused on a handful of minuscule spice producing
islands, among others Ambon and Banda, located a stone's throw west
of Irian.
	   Sightings and landings were made by Portuguese and Spanish
seafarers during the third decade of the 16th century, Dutchman Jan
Carstensz sighted the snow-covered mountain range that runs through
central Irian in 1632, and in 1770 Captain Cook's landing party at
the Asmat territory ``was sent packing with volleys of arrows''.
	   There was contact, but apart from the mingling in coastal areas
with peoples from other islands, there seemed not to have been any
deliberate move to occupy New Guinea. Attempts by the British and
Dutch during the late 18th and early 19th century to establish a
more permanent presence met with failure, but the turn of the
century saw the beginning of just such a presence taking shape in
the area.
	   At that time there were three Western powers sharing the island,
the Netherlands, Britain and Germany, so colonial politicking would
certainly be a major consideration, more than whatever the island
could offer for international markets.
	   Kamoro
	   Today numbering about 16,000, the Kamoro tribe occupies a
portion of an area located more or less in the middle of Irian
Jaya's southern coastal area, stretching about 300 km from Etna Bay
eastwards to the Otokwa river. The river runs some 40 km east of
the port of Amamapare, the exit point of copper, gold and silver
concentrate mined by PT Freeport Indonesia Company. The area
occupied by the Kamoro belongs to a larger group known as the
Mimika.
	   The tribe has had contacts with the outside world as far back as
the 17th century but until missionaries arrived in the 19th
century, these were far and few between. The missions were, at
least during that era, the only established presence in New Guinea.
Administrative order (i.e. the tools of Dutch, British and German
colonial rule) came about during the first years of the 20th
century, and helped intensify proselytizing activities.
	   Some benefits may have resulted from time these activities, but
they also brought about a far more serious consequence: the loss of
many features of Kamoro culture and traditions, among others those
connected with rites of passage.
	   Longhouses, the traditional living quarters of the Kamoro, were
destroyed and they were made to live in houses for individual
families.
	   Another highly developed talent of the Kamoro is wood carving,
but this art, too, began to languish because of the bans imposed by
missionaries, and later by government regulations after Irian Jaya
became part of Indonesia.
	   For much more than half a century, Kamoro art, culture and
traditions teetered on the brink of extinction. But times change,
and so did attitudes on the part of the missionaries and
authorities.
	   PT Freeport Indonesia, which operates in the area which includes
the traditional area of the Kamoro, claims that reviving the
culture of the native tribes in the contract of work area is part
of the company's social development program.
	   The company, a target of much criticism regarding its
environment practices and relations with local communities, also
claims it has to rely for its workforce on the tribes whose
homeland lies in the company's area of operations.
	   In fact, the company has reaped benefits from the knowledge of
the Kamoro. When the environmental department was at a loss about
how to stem subsiding of dikes and berms in the experimental ponds,
it was the Kamoro who came up with the idea of using sago tree
trunks instead.
	   But more than any other activity, it is artistic expression that
helps restore or rediscover one's cultural identity. Lately, there
has been a wave of efforts to revive many aspects of native
Indonesian artistic expressions, most prominent of which would be
the series of recordings produced by the Masyarakat Seni
Pertunjukan Indonesia (Indonesian Society for the Performing Arts)
of the myriad variety of musical styles in this country. Assistance
for this project came from the Smithsonian Institution and the Ford
Foundation, whilst for the revival of Kamoro arts.
	   PT Freeport Indonesia showed their interest in the project by
organizing the first Kamoro Arts  Culture Festival, that ran
recently at the village of Hitipau, some 30 kilometers southwest of
the town of Timika. Participants came from all 42 Kamoro villages
in the area. A dance festival, canoe races and an art auction were
the major programs of the festival.
	   Canoes play an important part in the lives of the Kamoro whose
villages are near either a river or the sea. The canoe has been and
probably still is the most important mode of transport for them.
	   Like the Asmat tribe, the Kamoro certainly do not suffer from a
lack of creativity and imagination. At this stage the Asmat and
Kamoro appear to be the only tribes that stand out as carvers, with
the former enjoying wider appreciation around the globe since more
than thirty years. But after this first Festival it will be only a
matter of time for the art of the Kamoro to achieve equal
prominence in as well as outside Indonesia.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ The Organization of African
Unity on Wednesday appointed a seven-member panel to investigate
the role of foreign powers and individuals in the 1994 Rwandan
genocide.
	   OAU Secretary General Salim Salim of Tanzania said the
investigation team would also examine measures to prevent a
re-occurrence of the massacres which resulted in about 500,000
deaths, mainly of ethnic Rwandan Tutsis.
	   Tutsi rebels based mainly in Uganda won power in Rwanda in July
1994 and ended the killings, which occurred several months after a
U.N. peacekeeping officer warned his superiors in a fax of the
danger of massacres planned by Hutu extremists.
	   OAU officials did not immediately provide details about the
terms of the new investigation, which will be led by newly-retired
Botswana president Ketumile Masire.
	   France and Belgium have both been accused by Rwanda of aiding
the architects of the genocide, and other Western powers have been
charged with ignoring the massacres. Kenya and the former
government of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, now
Congo, have also faced accusations of harboring genocide suspects.
	   It was not clear whether any of these countries would be under
investigation from the OAU panel.
	   The United Nations Security Council in April re-opened a 1995
investigation into alleged illegal arms sales to Rwanda, where
sympathisers of the country's former military are believed to be
fighting a low-level guerilla war against the Tutsi-led government.
	   Also appointed to the OAU panel are former Mali president Gen.
Toumani Toure; Algeria's ex-chairman of the International Court of
Justice Mohamed Bedjaou; former U.N. official and Liberian
presidential candidate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf; one-time U.N.
Development Program chief Lisbet Palme of Sweden; former Indian
Supreme Court chairman H. Bagwati and UNICEF deputy chief Stephen
Lewis of Canada.
	   The investigation team was first suggested by Ethiopian Prime
Minister Ato Meles Zewani in November 1997.
	   A U.N. tribunal on Rwanda has indicted 35 people with genocide
crimes.
	   Rwanda, frustrated by the slow pace of the U.N. tribunal, has
started its own trials of 125,000 suspects. So far, 144 of 337
convicted have received death sentences.

	   IF my mother were ever to ask my brother to sweep the floor or
have him scrub the bathroom, I know I'll have a heart attack. Yet,
she will never hesitate to let me know that the laundry needs to be
done, or that the table needs to be cleared.
	   Unfair? I'm sorry, but that is the way life is like when you
lack the ``Y'' chromosome. The biggest threat to gender equality,
unfortunately, shows up worst in most maternal figures.
	   I don't think I am the only female member of any family to feel
this way. I am not a 16-year-old brat griping about having to do
more chores than my brother.
	   I am a young, professional adult griping about the problem of
gender inequality that begins in the family unit.
	   The girl child is raised to believe that if she does not learn
to perform the household chores of cleaning, washing and cooking
(we'd like to say that we don't do windows, but that's too much of
a fantasy), then she isn't raised right.
	   Sure, we get to go to school and come home with degrees, but
we've still got to make sure there are no dirty dishes in the sink.
	   I am not accusing my mother of making a Cinderella out of me
(actually she can probably make two slender Cinderellas out of
me!). My mother has a job and she still has to take care of the
housework. Small wonder! Her mother raised her to endure the
responsibility of keeping the house from falling apart, and if she
were lucky enough to find a husband who could lift a finger to help
- the Almighty be praised.
	   Our male siblings are not really spared housework. It includes
the occasional lugging of heavy furniture and weekly washing to the
family car. And of course they have responsibilities. They involve
making sure the computer, television, radio and other electrical
equipment perform their respective functions satisfactorily
(something, presumably, us technically-challenged females cannot
comprehend).
	   Again, male children are raised to lounge before the idiot-box
or pursue their computer game fantasies while dinner is delivered
right before their faces.
	   After all, Daddy gets to do nothing... and still his plate is
cleared for him when he leaves the dinner table.
	   Perhaps this facet of life isn't apparent in families that have
maids to take care of the chores. But then, isn't it up to the
mother to make sure the maid does her job well? (The issue of the
maid being female is, of course, something else we have to look
into.) No, regardless of family and racial backgrounds, I have
friends who agree with me that their brothers get away with murder
while we are sentenced to hard labour.
	   An ex-classmate of Indian origin, now with a law degree, had to
help prepare dinner while her brothers played football. A close
Chinese friend of mine has to complete her share of housework
despite already having a long, hard day at work while her brother
takes a shower and gets ready for a television marathon.
	   There are probably other sisters who have a lot more
responsibilities to shoulder within the family unit, while the male
sibling is out at the nearest mamak stall with his buddies (who
probably also have sisters at home doing a mundane but absolutely
necessary chore).
	   Therefore, before we complain about men giving us a hard time
-pushing us to give our professional best and then going home to
give our personal best, let's think about women giving women a hard
time because we can't get the boys to do anything right. They've
never been taught to! It's time to get mothers to give their sons
some household responsibilities and make real men out of them (not
weenies who are afraid of hot oil splattering on them when frying
fish).
	   We daughters need to get our hands out of the dish-washing
detergent and into a vat of baby lotion.

New Russian prime minister makes first foreign trip and drastic measures needed to right Russian economy. Trims 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Kiriyenko meeting Jospin, telling Chirac urgent
AP Photos PAR108-109,PAR117
By DEBORAH SEWARD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted he
wasn't looking for handouts during meetings Wednesday with French
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   After arriving in Paris at the start of a two-day visit _ his
first overseas since becoming Prime Minister in April _ Kiriyenko
twice told reporters an economic aid package was not on his agenda.
	   ``Neither on the official program nor outside the official
program is that (aid) a question,'' Kiriyenko said after his
meeting at the Elysee Palace with Chirac.
	   A small man in a blue suit who at times appeared lost among the
husky Russian businessmen and bodyguards who accompanied him,
Kiriyenko nevertheless projected confidence and determination.
	   For his part, Chirac told Kiriyenko he had ``confidence in
Russia's capacity to carry out its reform policies,'' presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   Chirac urged Kiriyenko to improve tax collection, create a
modern and transparent banking system as well as a judicial and
fiscal framework for business, Colonna told reporters.
	   Russia's dismal record in collecting taxes has left the
government with a huge fiscal hole, enormous debts, an inability to
pay state workers and is at the heart of the current crisis.
	   Spokeswoman Colonna said Kiriyenko told Chirac ``urgent and
drastic'' measures were needed to right the Russian economy and
that he would push them through.
	   The ongoing Russian financial crisis has fueled speculation that
some kind of aid package from the world's leading industrialized
nation may be needed, primarily to prevent a collapse of the ruble.
	   Kiriyenko did say ``relations between G-7 countries and Russia
have reached a new stage.'' He didn't elaborate but said it is
vital for the European Union to open its markets to Russian goods.
	   Finance officials from the G-7 are to meet in Paris next week,
and Russia's economic troubles among the issues high on their
agenda.
	   Before meeting Chirac, Kiriyenko said Russia must further
integrate into the world economy to better withstand financial
shock waves like those that have shaken Asia and Russia recently.
	   The Russian stock market has fallen about 50 percent from the
beginning of 1998, a dramatic change from the previous year's
record growth of 98 percent.
	   France is a modest trading partner, just eighth among Western
European nations, and Russia would like to increase ties with
aerospace, nuclear and automobile manufacturers.
	   However, France traditionally enjoys good political relations
with Russia and could be expected to support an eventual economic
aid package and easing of EU restrictions on Russian market access.

	   LABUAN, Tues.- Some 7.51 million Malaysians went abroad as
tourists last year compared to 6.2 million foreigners who came to
Malaysia during the same period.
	   Culture, Arts and Tourism parliamentary secretary Datuk Mohd Noh
Rajab said Malaysian tourists overseas spent RM4.2 billion last
year.
	   There was an increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting
Labuan with 66,912 people last year compared to 53,235 in 1996.
	   Mohd Noh was speaking at the closing ceremony of the Labuan Sea
Challenge 98 event on Sunday.
	   He said to attract more tourists the Immigration Department
should hasten the processing of social visit passes.
	   ``With the depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit, foreign
tourists should take the opportunity to visit Malaysia,'' he said.
	   He also said efforts were under way to encourage domestic
tourism so that locals could choose to travel within Malaysia,
especially in the wake of the economic slowdown as it would be
easier on the pocket.
	   He said there was a need to develop new tourism products,
improve transport facilities and increase the number of events
which would attract tourism.
	   Meanwhile, Labuan Tourism Committee chairman Datuk Baseri
Lamsah, said the main aim of the Labuan Sea Challenge 98 was to
promote potential sea sports which can help make Labuan a popular
sea sport destination in the region.
	   The Labuan Sea Challenge 98 saw 150 participants from Brunei,
Singapore, New Zealand, Kuala Lumpur, Sarawak, Sabah and Labuan
taking part in the event.

World Cup qualifiers draw 0-0 in unattractive exhibition 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with substitution for Saeed al-Owairan in lineups.
<TEXT>
	   CRETEIL, France (AP) _ Fellow World Cup qualifiers Mexico and
Saudi Arabia played to an unattractive 0-0 draw Wednesday, with
North Americans having most of the possession and the Saudis the
better scoring chances.
	   Playing before a crowd of 5,000 in a small venue, the Saudis
opened the game with an opportunity in the first minute when Khalid
al-Muwalid shot wide from one yard. And in the 22nd, Sami al-Jaber
couldn't head a ball from good position, with Mexican goalkeeper
Osvaldo Perez beaten.
	   Luis Garcia troubled the Saudis the most, but failed on three
chances. He shot high from 10 yards in the first half and wasting
two more opportunities in the second. On the first he shot wide
after receiving a pass from Luis Hernandez and was blocked by Saudi
Mohammed al-Dayea.
	   Mexico used an experimental lineup in which Garcia started up
front along side Ricardo Pelaez while regular strikers Hernandez
and Cuauhtemoc Blanco played wide midfield.
	   The experiment didn't seem particularly successful, but Mexican
coach Manuel Lapuente said he was ``satisfied'' with his team's
performance.
	   ``We made several changes in our lineup and played well at the
end,'' he said. ``During the World Cup you'll see a very different
team. Against South Korea (Mexico's first opponent) you'll see the
result of our job.''
	   ___  
  Lineups  
	   Mexico: Oscar Perez, Isaac Terrazas, Raul Lara, Joel Sanchez,
Salvador Carmona, German Villa, Marcelino Bernal, Luis Hernandez
(Jesus Palencia-69) , Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Jesus Arellano, 69th
minute), Ricardo Pelaez (Ramon Ramirez, 52nd), Luis Garcia.

Hamas says it is ready for dialogue with America

Eds: INSERTS suicide bombing toll in graf 6, no pickup
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Palestinian group whose suicide
bombers have killed scores of civilians in Israel says it is
prepared to talk to Washington, but only to ``clarify facts'' and
not to take orders.
	   ``We do not close the door in front of any dialogue with the
United States, if it wants this,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, said in remarks published Wednesday by
the Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   He accused the United States of supporting Israel, and warned
that ``we fight our enemy and those who stand by its side.''
	   While there was no chance of talks with Israel, Hamas could
discuss matters with the United States, he was quoted as saying.
	   But the dialogue must be to ``clarify facts and not to receive
orders and dictations,'' he said.
	   Hamas is bitterly opposed to the U.S.-sponsored peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians. It advocates the total
destruction of Israel and claimed responsibility for several
suicide bombings that killed some 80 civilians in Israel in
1996-97.
	   ``We are talking with Israel by arms and force until it knows
who is strong (and) right. We will continue to talk to it (Israel)
by this method until we liberate all Palestinian territories and
not part of it,'' he said.
	   Al-Hayat, a leading Arabic-language newspaper published in
London, interviewed Yassin in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, the
latest stop on his tour of Muslim countries to win support for
Hamas.
	   Yassin, who is 61-years old and quadriplegic, has so far visited
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Yemen and Syria. He is expected to travel to Pakistan and Malaysia.

U.S. ambassador: announcement on U.S. peace initiative in days minister in grafs 5-6 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu graf 4, transportation
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The United States expects Israel to
reach a decision on a West Bank troop withdrawal within days, not
weeks, as suggested by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel said Wednesday.
	   Ambassador Edward Walker said that while the United States has
not given Israel a deadline to accept a U.S. proposal for a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, ``there is a very
short time frame.''
	   Netanyahu told lawmakers Tuesday that he expected to have made a
decision on an Israeli troop pullback by the end of July, before
parliament goes into summer recess, according to legislator Yehuda
Harel of the centrist Third Way party.
	   ``I am sure we can reach an agreement that will bring full
security to Israel and will also compel the Palestinian Authority
to fulfill its commitments,'' Netanyahu said at a ceremony later
Wednesday.
	   However, far-right coalition partners have warned Netanyahu that
they would bring down his government over a 13 percent troop
pullback, and Netanyahu is reluctant to accept the U.S. plan. But
Shaul Yaahalom, a member of the right-wing National Religious Party
which holds nine key seats in Netanyahu's 61-120 majority in
parliament, told Israel TV that a coalition collapse could be
avoided.
	   Yaahalom, who serves as transportation minister, said that his
party could vote against the withdrawal in Cabinet but abstain from
a no-confidence vote in parliament, in order to keep Netanyahu in
power while voicing their opposition to the withdrawal.
	   Walker said Wednesday that the United States will soon make a
decision on whether to pursue its peace initiative. If a failure is
announced, Israel would bear the brunt of the blame because the
Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan.
	   ``It (the decision) is in a matter of days rather than weeks,
but precisely what day and what hour and so on I have no idea
exactly. It depends how the progress goes,'' Walker said.
	   Last month, Israel already ignored one U.S. deadline, and
Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Wednesday
that Washington displayed ``a lack of will to stand firm in the
face of Israel's intransigence.''
	   On Tuesday, U.S. envoy Thomas Pickering asked Jordanian and
Saudi Arabian leaders to delay plans for an Arab summit for another
week to allow the American initiative to play itself out.
	   The Palestinians are pushing for an Arab summit that would
conclude with an announcement that the Arab world is suspending the
normalization of ties with Israel as long as Netanyahu does not
carry out the peace agreement already signed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat traveled to Oman on Wednesday
to lobby for support among Gulf State leaders to convene an Arab
summit. Palestinians have said that they will push for the summit
even if Israel does accept the U.S. proposals.
	   In London, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met Wednesday with two
top Palestinian officials to discuss the troop withdrawal.
According to Maariv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon declined an invitation to
attend the meeting because the government has not yet decided on
the scope of a troop pullback.

<TEXT>
	   I DREADED going through, sorting out and eventually throwing
away my old stuff that had been collected through the years and was
packed neatly in boxes and big paper bags.
	   It has been more than a year since my family and I moved into
the house which we are in now but my boxes and bags remained
untouched in my room, that is, till recently.
	   Perhaps that should have indicated to me of the use I will still
have for those things which have been put away.
	   I had finally exhausted all excuses so I resigned myself to the
horrid task of battling dust-mites and old memories.
	   I knew old memories would come flooding back as soon as I opened
those boxes and bags but the things I found surprised even me.
	   First, there was this funny Valentine and some poems given to me
by a good friend during our university days who believed that I had
somehow encouraged him in his writing. These made me smile, knowing
full well what he is today.
	   Among the volumes of books I had stored up, I found a local male
magazine that had the autograph of the editor. The words he wrote
brought me back to 1994 when he came to speak to us at the
university. The way we had gawked at him, absolutely mesmerised by
his easy charm and good looks, now made me blush.
	   I thought I had soaked in every word he said but for the life of
me, I could not even recall one. Those were the days.
	   While I was flipping through old foolscap pads to see if there
was anything written in them which would prevent me from throwing
them away, a small piece of paper flew out and on it was scribbled
the following: ``I had thought that by cutting my long hair, I
would be able to erase some memories and hopes but all I was left
with from that impulsive act was a physical reminder of a broken
heart and shattered dreams.''
	   This was dated Aug 14, 1994. The thought which came instantly to
mind was, ``I wrote that?''
	   I had only very recently cut my hair and I probably sport a
similar hairstyle to the one I had four years ago but the broken
heart and shattered dreams were now a thing of the past.
	   According to Cicero, there is no sorrow or pain which time does
not soften and lessen and I sincerely believe that time had done
just that. I crumpled up that piece of paper and threw it away,
confident that I had moved on and I no longer want to be reminded
of that part of my past.
	   Funny how the importance of certain things diminishes though,
like my secondary school report book, for instance. I had kept it
faithfully for the last six years.
	   How I used to dread those teacher-meeting-parent sessions where
my grades and performance in class were discussed. My mother never
failed to attend these sessions. Did I actually believe that it
would have any significance at all later in life? I threw it away.
	   I had collected materials for teaching purposes such as
newspaper articles, coloured charts and graphs, interesting
anecdotes from magazines, comic strips - in short, whatever I had
believed would come in handy -since the first year of university.
	   When I went through those boxes and bags, I realised that I had
accumulated such a lot of stuff in those three years! Mum and sis
helped a great deal too as they would ask me if I had wanted any of
the above before discarding them. My reply would always be, ``Sure,
why not?''
	   Thus, besides being the ``bag lady'' (I collect bags of
different colours, sizes and shapes too) of the house, I was also
the ``junk collector'' of the house.
	   I was so reluctant to throw away all these things which I had so
meticulously collected and stored but I knew I had to put them away
because they had served their purpose. If only memories can be
discarded like the way I discarded these things.
	   Among the things that were meant for the dumpster, I found
things which could still be used, like a beautiful pair of silver
earrings from Peter Hoe's collection which was tucked away in a
smart-looking clutch purse.
	   I had probably meant it for somebody but had forgotten all about
it.
	   I also found a ceramic plaque with the words ``God bless our
home''
	   written on it which I had intended to give a couple on their
wedding day but was not able to as they had rushed off immediately
after the ceremony.
	   Now that seemed so long ago. They probably have two children by
now.
	   (Julie, if you happen to read this, call me.) My task would have
been greatly simplified if all the things I had come across could
be grouped into two categories - useful and no longer useful.
	   And not whether they had sentimental value or not.
	   I believe I spent more time reading through and reminiscing
about the past than actually throwing things away.
	   After filling up two boxes and three garbage bags, I was still
left with a floor full of odds and ends - a pewter key-ring, magic
coloured pens, old story books, old cassettes, cards and bookmarks.
	   Unless you have a big house with a huge attic and plenty of room
to spare, clearing away old things is as natural and inevitable as
putting away old clothes to be given away.
	   Some things like calendars and festive greeting cards - though
given by special people - lose their use and simply take up space.
	   Little did I know that day that by throwing away some old things
of mine, I was in effect eliminating some memories.
	   If I do not see that particular item again, I probably will not
recall the events associated with that particular item.
	   I threw a lot of memories away that day but I know that new ones
are being collected every day and before I know it, Mum will be on
my back again.
	   By looking through my old things, I saw how much I have grown
and matured as an individual through the years and all those
memorabilia from the past simply reminded me of the phases of life
which I had to go through to get to where I am and the people who
have in one way or another contributed to making me the person I am
today.
	   For those who have nothing to do at home, just spend one
afternoon clearing your old things and you will learn more about
yourself than you ever will by watching movies in a lifetime.

	   MOTHERS! When we were very young, Mother was the most important
person at home. For the meals, the clothes, the bedroom things,
when we fell and hurt ourselves, when we lost a fight... she was
there for us. She was the answer, she was the consolation, she was
the anchor.
	   Then, as we grew up, we became a little deaf to all her
``nagging'' about good manners, tidiness, punctuality. We didn't
like being reminded that we were too young for this and that.
	   When we were not-so-young, we had to think up all sorts of
excuses to cover up for girlfriend/boyfriend outings so that she
wouldn't probe and pry too much.
	   Then, after we got married, which we thought must be one of her
three most important wishes for us, she had to cry at our weddings!
Then, when we produce grandchildren for her, thinking that's
another important wish of hers, and we try to discipline them the
way she did with us, we get scolded for being too strict with our
children.
	   Ordinarily, a mother has several battles to fight on her own.
The battle of the bulge - from finishing leftovers on the plates;
clearing obstacles - from the mountains of laundry and dishes after
a meal; her menstrual cycle, which is supposed to explain her
emotional outbursts; and later on, menopause, which is supposed to
explain her idiosyncrasies.
	   When I backtrack to my younger days, I recall that the only
automation that got most of the work done for an average family of
eight was something called ``Mother''.
	   Today, with my electric rice-cooker, my washing machine and my
microwave oven, I still can't catch up with all my household chores
- and there are only two of us left at home! We marvel at the
things mothers talk about - their children's fevers, fights, falls,
scars, bad test results, allergies and dental appointments... what
do they talk about if all these do not happen?
	   So how does one understand a mother? Don't try. Let her complain
why you haven't come to see her for so long; and when you do it too
often, let her complain (to others) that your visits give her too
much clearing up to do.
	   It is said that ``the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand
that rules the world'' - and as we grow more appreciative, we
perceive its resilience, love and forgiveness.
	   She is there for breakfast time, lunch time, tea time, dinner
time... is there some compensation for overtime?

	   As my friend Roland Woehrle pointed out in his May 27 farewell
letter, Indonesia is a great country and I personally believe that
if there is a solution to the present crisis, there might even be a
brighter future than Indonesian people nowadays dream of! That
requires good politicians available to come to the fore and also
support from the international community.
	   It will certainly take a lot of time until the country is
reformed to the extent the people demand.
	   In the meantime, may I, as an expatriate, ask for a favor,
namely to include some reforms for us in the overall program. I
would definitely feel much more comfortable and relaxed here in
your country, if:
	   the new government would cancel the ridiculous exit tax
residents must pay every time they leave the country.
	   the new government would liberalize visa and stay/work permits
to enable international businesspeople to move around more easily.
As long as the corresponding regulations are being misused by
Indonesian immigration staff to squeeze people for money,
businesspeople will certainly not be motivated, as they have in the
past, to stay on.
	   TV programs should be liberalized so that, for instance, people
are not presented with a president's speech on all six channels at
the same time. I consider this kindergarten programming not
suitable for grown-up people, who should have options.
	   I realize, of course, that at this moment the new government has
more important subjects of reform but as you'll need foreign
support to overcome your problems it would be nice if some foreign
requirements could also be considered.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Health Ministry has set Dec 31 as the
deadline for all clinics registered with the Foreign Workers'
Medical Examination Monitoring Agency to be on-line with its
central database system.
	   At present, only 25 per cent of the panel of 1,908 clinics
registered with Fomema nationwide are able to transmit the results
of foreign workers' medical examinations directly to the agency.
	   Fomema managing director Dr Mohd Haniffa Abdulla said almost
1,500 clinics have yet to establish computer links.
	   He advised these clinics to do so early to avoid the rush when
the deadline draws near.
	   He said the rationale for the computer link-up was to protect
doctor-patient confidentiality as well as to prevent any tampering
with medical reports.
	   Clinics which are not on-line currently send the medical reports
to Fomema offices.
	   The sophisticated data collection system requires doctors to
transmit information about the foreign workers and their medical
examination results into the central database. This allows for
instantaneous retrieval and checking of data.
	   The database is also linked to the Immigration Department and
the Health Ministry.
	   The network enables Fomema to generate a ``Fit'' or ``Not Fit''
notice, on each foreign worker, to the Immigration Department.

	   UNIQUE. That best describes the lower Kinabatangan floodplain on
the east coast of Sabah. A slow boat ride along the 560-kilometre
long Kinabatangan River, which flows into the Sulu Sea, reveals
diverse forms of vegetation and animals.
	   Wildlife such as the orang utan, the proboscis monkey, macaque,
Asian elephant, hornbill and wild cattle are just some of God's
creations along the Kinabatangan.
	   Because of their beauty and uniqueness in Nature, the time has
come to give due consideration to conserving wildlife in forest
reserves and wildlife sanctuaries not only in the Kinabatangan
floodplain but also in the rest of the country.
	   Recent fires affecting many parts of Malaysia and Indonesia have
posed a threat to our wildlife and the eco-system.
	   For now, we may still be able to steal glimpses of orang utans
and proboscis monkeys but for how long? Will future generations get
to see Asian elephants on river banks?
	   The fire that broke out in the Pin Supu Forest Reserve in
Kinabatangan on April 13 were a threat to wildlife. About 300
hectares of the reserve were razed out of the total 4,696 hectares.
	   While it may seem relatively insignificant since some 40 per
cent or 368,436 hectares of the 921,089 hectares in the
Kinabatangan Forestry District are forest reserves, there are
reasons to be concerned.
	   Kinabatangan Forestry district officer Fadzil Yahya believes
that the fire, which broke out in the middle of the reserve, was
caused by hunters.
	   ``We suspect hunters started the fire because the area that was
burnt is in the middle of the reserve. Normally if a fire breaks
out on the reserve's fringe, it is caused by open burning at nearby
plantations,'' he says.
	   Putting out the fires in Pin Supu is no easy task as the soil is
peat.
	   Officers from the Kota Kinabatangan Forestry Department, the
District Office, the police, locals and environmental group World
Wide Fund for Nature have all played their role in keeping the
fires under control.
	   The fires were first reported by WWF scientific officer Martin
Paul Vogel, who is doing a study in Batu Putih, located close to
the reserve.
	   With help from the various parties, the men, including a handful
who received house training in fire fighting, started manually
making fire breaks. With limited equipment such as water pumps,
parang and water sprays, they managed to make a fire break within a
week. They also dug a 1.8-metre pond to retain water from the
Kinabatangan River, which flows five kilometres away.
	   After a week, they managed to obtain two excavators to dig
one-metre deep trenches within a 2.5-km radius of the affected
area.
	   Tractors were used as peat is very soft. Peat fires are
difficult to suppress as they could go on burning underground.
	   The recent showers brought a brief respite to the area which had
been experiencing a water shortage due to the prolonged drought and
land-clearing activities from nearby oil palm estates.
	   However, if fire breaks out again both in Pin Supu and in the
surrounding areas, a grimmer picture can be expected as there is
limited staff to conduct surveillance, enforcement and patrolling
for the 20 forest reserves.
	   Kota Kinabatangan wildlife officer Rashid Saburi fears that big
fires - such as the one which broke out in the Kulamba Forest
Reserve resulting in 1,000 hectares going up in smoke - will
endanger the rare and wild cattle, known locally as tembadau, in
the long run.
	   He estimates that there are no more than 50 such cattles within
Kulamba.
	   In the whole of Sabah, they number about 500.
	   Slow-moving mammals and reptiles, he says, are also under
threat. Fast- moving animals like squirrels and birds have a better
chance of escaping.
	   In fact, Rahid found charred remains of snakes and terrapins
when putting out the fires.
	   ``There is a need,'' he insists, ``to make people aware of the
hazards of open burning on the environment and wildlife.''
	   In the 20,000-hectare Kulamba, the fires were believed to have
been started by fishermen who cook by the beach.
	   Rashid suspects that charred logs dumped on the beach led to
fires spreading to nearby Kulamba.
	   Using the limited resources available, the fire fighters at
Kulumba used a 1.6-kilometre-long hose to pump in sea water. Water
bombing was also deployed with the help of the Royal Malaysian Air
Force as a last resort.
	   WWF environmental pollution analyst Rick Gregory says there is
no special unit to fight fires in Kinabatangan.
	   ``Everyone is learning on the job,'' he says, ``and many are
ill-trained.''
	   He adds that many people are still practising open burning,
especially to clear land next to forest reserves and wildlife
sanctuaries.
	   ``One of our roles in WWF is to make an impact assessment study
using helicopters and conducting ground surveys on how fires have
threatened existing habitats,'' he says.

Qualifier Romania struggles to beat Paraguay

Eds: repeating to some points
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A penalty kick gave Romania a narrow
3-2 victory over Paraguay on Wednesday in a warm-up game for the
World Cup in France.
	   The match was of particular importance for the Romanians as
their first game at the tournament is against Colombia whose play
is considered similar to that of Paraguay.
	   Romania's star player Gheorghe Hagi scored the winner in the
83rd minute from a penalty kick after Gheorghe Craioveanu
conveniently fell in the penalty area.
	   Although Romania looked more confident and controlled the game
most of the time, its defense had often problems with stopping
Paraguay's fast counterattacks.
	   The Romanians scored only four minutes after kickoff in
Bucharest's Steaua stadium.
	   It was Valencia's star Adrian Ilie, nicknamed ``Cobra'', who
scored from inside the penalty area with a ball centered from the
right by his future teammate Gabi Popescu.
	   Popescu was transferred last week from Salamanca to Valencia.
	   In the 27th minute, a Paraguayan counterattack found Jose
Cardozo free at 16 meters (yards) from the goal. Romanian
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea warded off his shot, but Cardozo scored on
the rebound.
	   Romania looked strong after change of sides, and in the 57th
minute, Hagi made brilliant use of a free kick from 25 meters by
serving Ilie who scored the second goal.
	   Only seven minutes later, Roberto Acuna beat the Romanian goalie
with a spectacular shot from about 20 meters in far-right position.
	   Paraguay also lost very good opportunity to take the lead in the
44th minute when Acuna fired from 30 meters (years) but hit the
crossbar.
	   In France, Romania plays in Group G together with England,
Colombia and Tunisia, while Paraguay meets in Group D Spain,
Bulgaria and Nigeria.
	   Lineups:
	   Romania: Bogdan Stelea, Constantin Galca, Dorinel Munteanu,
Cristian Dulca, Gheorghe Popescu, Iulian Filipescu, Dan Petrescu,
Gheorghe Hagi, Gabi Popescu, Adrian Ilie, Viorel Moldovan,
	   Paraguay: Jose Luis Chilavert, Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Catalino Rivarola, Roberto Acuna, Julio Cesar Enciso, Carlos
Paredes, Miguel Angel Benitez, Jose Cardozo, Pedro Sarabia, Cesar
Ramirez.

	   Kompas of May 30 carried a thought-inspiring caricature
depicting a bunch of hilarious, merciless-looking men who raise
posters identifying their respective political parties, while
others hold up still blank posters. A trampled, injured man in rags
lies dying on the ground, personifying the battered national
economy. In a corner, a modest image of a common man displaying a
poster signals the Sembako Party. Sembako is an acronym for the
nine basic commodities.
	   The striking satirical message elicited by the caricature
reflects first the escalating breakaway of certain groupings from
some existing political parties, other than the justifiable moves
of former repressed opposition leaders to set up new political
parties.
	   Second, the image of the dying man and the innocent common man
wielding the Sembako Party sign fitly depicts the callous disregard
on the part of the political movements of vested interest groups
vis-a-vis the poor economic state of the country and the people's
suffering in the current economic crisis.
	   In my view, the caricature should serve as a reminder that the
existence of a multitude of political parties, with rampant,
incessant antagonism raging between them, as prevailed in the
1950s, did not provide political stability, nor economic
development, to the country and people. Cabinets survived less than
a year.
	   It resembled the political instability in France which held sway
in the 1950s in the pre-De Gaulle era.
	   A university professor of constitutional law in a talk show on
SCTV on Sunday evening (May 31) stated that in the 1950s no
antagonism existed between political parties in the matter of their
programs.
	   But it must be recalled that the antagonism between the parties
in 1958 reached such a stage as to end up in a stalemate of the
Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, which undertook to lay
down a new constitution. This stalemate angered president Sukarno,
who at that time went on record with the warning ``I will bury the
political parties''. He finally revived the 1945 Constitution.
	   The antagonism between the political parties which caused the
failure of the Assembly in 1958 must serve as a lesson for
retrospection and introspection to the leaders who are intent on
founding new political parties and accordingly participating in the
coming general election.

representing the State's Commonwealth Games' promotions committee.
	   The state-level promotion, to be launched by Youth and Sports
Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Mohd Yassin at a shopping complex in
Bandar Hilir on July 20, would use the grants from Sukom Ninety
Eight Berhad to carry out the activities.
	   ``There is, therefore, no need for contributions or donations
from companies or individuals,'' State Family Development, Youth
and Sports Committee chairman Datuk Noordin Yaani said today.
	   The committee is chaired by Noordin.

	   Referring to an article titled Are foreign lawyers a problem? in
The Jakarta Post by Donna Woodward on April 23, 1998 concerning the
issue of the employment of foreign lawyers in Indonesia, we
restrain ourselves not to give any comments on it. Nonetheless,
since this article also touched on immigration affairs, we are
obliged to state as follows:
	   1. As in the past, the Directorate General of Immigration of
Indonesia always welcomes any suggestions, complaints and criticism
as long as they supported by complete and concrete data. With such
data, the relevant agencies will conduct an investigation into the
issue with a view to solving it immediately.
	   2. As for the statements made in the article relating to
immigration affairs, we would be appreciative if Ms. Donna K.
Woodward could promptly furnish the following complete and correct
data for us to follow up:
	   a. The names of ``ill-qualified expatriates who were employed
without work permits in North Sumatra'';
	   b. The names of ``cheap foreigners who work in Indonesia without
proper credentials and permits'';
	   c. The names of ``self-styled foreign consultants, managers,
English teachers (English teachers who are the most ubiquitous
undocumented workers, at least in Medan)'';
	   d. The names of ``some employers who have gone to great length
and expense to obtain work permits are victimized by greedy
immigration officials'';
	   e. The names of ``other foreigners who work openly for years
without obtaining the proper sponsorship and permits''.
	   3. After receiving the above data, the Directorate General of
Immigration will investigate immediately the matters, the results
of which will be given to Ms. Donna K. Woodward in about three
weeks. And those who are proven guilty will be punished properly
according to the existing rules and regulations. However, if Ms.
Donna K. Woodward fails to provide us with the required data
mentioned above in a reasonable period of time, it will be clear
that her statements are simply baseless and thus her credibility
put in question. People can assume therefore that her arguments to
defend her case before Indonesian lawyers on the issue by blaming
others as a scapegoat is malicious act.
	   4. With regard to her statement that the rules are obscure, etc.
It is of her own interpretation. If she doesn't understand clearly
these rules and regulations, she could have an opportunity to
consult or check with the relevant agency in the Immigration Office
for clarification.
	   We are looking forward to receiving the full and complete data
from Ms. Donna K. Woodward soon for further action.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - While ikan merah has always been noted as
among the more expensive fish in the market, today's survey showed
it was cheaper than the more common ikan selar at least at one
outlet.
	   The Lucky Garden wet market which in the past sold it around
RM10 per kilogramme, offered it for only RM8.
	   Instead, ikan selar which previously cost around RM6.50 per kg,
was sold at RM10 per kg today.
	   At other outlets, ikan merah remained more expensive, selling at
between RM7 and RM13.90 per kg compared to ikan selar at RM4.90 to
RM7.60.
	   However, the Klang Valley's price for ikan merah was much
cheaper than Ipoh where it cost RM17.90 to RM20 per kg.
	   In Ipoh, ikan selar cost RM8 against RM6.50 three days ago at
Central Market. Vegetables ruled stable.
	   The fish was selling at RM8.50 (RM7) and RM7.50 (RM5.50) at
Canning Garden and Buntong markets respectively. In Super Kinta it
cost RM9.50.
	   There was not much change in the price of greens.
	   In Penang, ikan merah ranged between RM5 and RM8 per kg at the
three wet markets.It was unavailable at the Super Komtar and
Looking Good supermarkets. At Sui Wah it cost RM4.50.
	   Green chillies were sold at RM7 per kg at the Chowrasta and
Datuk Keramat wet markets and RM8.50 at Pulau Tikus.
	   They cost RM10 per kg at Super Komtar while they were
unavailable at Sui Wah and Looking Good.
	   Sawi was selling between RM4.50 and RM5 at the wet markets but
was unavailable at the supermarkets.

	   JOHOR BARU, Tues. - The Terengganu Government and Universiti
Teknologi Malaysia today signed a memorandum of understanding to
source UTM's expertise in ensuring sustainable development at
Kenyir Lake.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Wan Mokhtar Ahmad said Lembaga Kemajuan
Terengganu Tengah, entrusted with the development of the lake area,
was banking on UTM's expertise to put Kenyir on the world map.
	   Wan Mokhtar said Kenyir with its 340 islands, historic caves,
flora and fauna and 38,000ha of fresh water area including rapids
and water falls, was listed as one of the country's 12 premier
tourist attractions.
	   ``In line with efforts to upgrade tourism facilities at Kenyir
Lake, Ketengah invited investors to develop Kenyir Lake along the
same lines as Italy's famous Lake Como.
	   ``We received a total of 122 proposals from various parties keen
to set up hotels and resorts, restaurants, air service, boat
services, research centres and recreational facilities,'' he said.

Jamaican leader gives plots of land to World Cup team 
</HEADLINE>
By CAROLL ORR
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ No matter what their fortunes in this
month's World Cup playoffs, Jamaican national soccer team players
all will have plots of land to call home when they return to the
Caribbean.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson presented sales
agreements for parcels of land to each of the team's 22 players
Wednesday during an official send-off.
	   Called the Reggae Boyz, it is the first Jamaican team to win a
berth in the international competition, and the first from an
English-speaking Caribbean nation.
	   ``We have created history and excitement but we are going to
create even more history and excitement by what we achieve by our
performance in France,'' Patterson said. ``There are more miracles
yet to be revealed.''
	   He praised the players, their Brazilian coach Rene Simoes and
the Jamaica Football Federation, which turned the team from a
volunteer squad into a full-time professional team through heavy
marketing and sponsorships.
	   Patterson likened Simoes' dedication to that of Jesus Christ,
despite Simoes' announcement last month that he would leave the
team in October. He made the decision after a national newspaper
reported he was being paid dlrs 18,300 a month, more than any
Jamaican public official.
	   Simoes also has drawn criticism for replacing native-born
Jamaicans with players born in Britain to Jamaican parents.
	   ``Whatever our outcome, you have served us well,'' Patterson
told Simoes. ``We are proud of you and we can say no more than to
pay the highest tribute: to say that we see you as a true and
outstanding (honorary) Jamaican.''

	   A NEW prototype toilet block designed by the Housing and Local
Government Ministry is set to replace existing public toilets by
the end of the year.
	   Its Deputy Minister Datuk Azmi Khalid said the RM200,000 block
consisting of toilets for males and females and one for the
disabled can be part of any building.
	   The toilets will initially be introduced in Kuala Lumpur and
later extended to other parts of the country.
	   Azmi said the toilets could also be free-standing.
	   Speaking to reporters after visiting public toilets at Dataran
Merdeka, the Klang bus station and the Puduraya bus terminal, he
said the new concept was the outcome of a series of studies and
brainstorming sessions between Kuala Lumpur City Hall and the
ministry.
	   Also present was Deputy Minister in the Prime Minster's
Department Datuk Dr Ibrahim Saad.
	   Asked about the need for the standard toilet, Azmi said the
public was generally confused by different maintenance systems for
toilets.
	   ``People are finding it difficult getting used to different
forms of facilities in public toilets such as the flush system
which differs from toilet to toilet,'' he said.
	   Azmi said the standard toilet would be built at a site earmarked
by the ministry and City Hall.
	   He said the men's section would have four cubicles and the
women's six.
	   ``This is because women tend to bring children with them into
toilets.
	   ``This is why we have two cubicles for children. There will also
be space for changing of diapers,'' he said.
	   The toilet floors will have non-slip tiles which are easy to dry
and safe for children and the aged.
	   ``Despite the fact that the equipment in the toilets would be
exposed to theft, we will not compromise on quality and all
facilities and fixtures will be heavy-duty material,'' Azmi said.
	   Asked if the standard toilet would be privatised, Azmi said it
was up to City Hall to work out the details.
	   ``I believe, if it is viable, City Hall will not dismiss the
idea of privatisation as a possible form of providing
better-serviced toilets,'' he said.
	   He said existing City Hall public toilets would be torn down and
replaced with the standard toilets.

	   A portion of the article Soeharto's fall a near repeat of
Sukarno's ruin by Tjipta Lesmana of May 29 reads: ``Similar was the
downfall of President Marcos of the Philippines. At critical
moments, Defense Minister Gen. Fidel Ramos and Chief of the Armed
Forces Gen. Fabian Fer defected and sided with the people.''
	   For the correct information, please note the following: It was
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile who led the mutiny against
Marcos and was joined later by Gen. Fidel Ramos, Chief of the
defunct Philippine Constabulary at that time Armed Forces Chief of
Staff Gen. Fabian Ver (not Fer), who was loyal as ever to Marcos
until they fled to Honolulu, Hawaii, never defected to the side of
the people. He is, even now, in hiding in another country.

	   WHILE public toilets in Dataran Merdeka, the Klang bus station
and the Puduraya bus terminal got the thumbs up from Deputy
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Dr Ibrahim Saad,
the same could not be said for the Pos Malaysia Berhad and City
Chemist premises at the Puduraya terminal.
	   Ibrahim said he was disappointed with the lack of cleanliness at
the exterior of the premises of the two companies.
	   Speaking to reporters after visiting toilets and public areas at
the three bus terminals, he said he was satisfied with the general
maintenance and cleanliness.
	   ``I am happy that the various managements, especially that of
the Puduraya terminal, have taken our criticism seriously and
improved toilet cleanliness.
	   ``But I am really disappointed with large corporate tenants like
Pos Malaysia and City Chemist for failing to maintain the exteriors
of their premises.''
	   He said the two companies should have taken the trouble to
spruce up their respective areas.
	   Ibrahim also inspected the newly-installed air filter at the
Puduraya bus terminal, believed to be the first in the country for
a bus terminal.

Battling Belgians win 2-0 to compound Colombia's woes 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium demolished Colombia 2-0
Wednesday with a display of rugged determination and tight teamwork
that added to the South American's pre-World Cup woes.
	   Defeat in a rain-soaked King Baudouin Stadium followed
Colombia's 3-1 mauling by Germany Saturday and disappointing draws
against Scotland and Chile.
	   By contrast, Belgium, going into its fifth consecutive World Cup
finals, is looking better with every game.
	   The Belgian defense blunted the attacking thrust of Faustino
Asprilla and Freddy Rincon and flashes of brilliance from Luc Nilis
and Marc Wilmots belied the dour reputation of the ``Red Devils.''
	   ``The goals are coming,'' said Wilmots. ``We're playing very
fast, we're playing very well.''
	   Wilmots, who plays his club soccer at Germany's Schalke 04,
supplied the best moment of the match.
	   Roaming the wide, open spaces left by his Colombian markers, the
stylish midfielder picked up a loose ball some 25 meters (yards)
and rifled in a right foot shot that soared into the top corner of
the net beyond Oscar Cordoba's despairing dive for 2-0 in the 31st
minute.
	   Danny Boffin had already shown up the porous Colombian defense
in the 16th minute racing in unmarked to head home a Luis Oliveira
pass from pointblank range for 1-0.
	   Colombia struck back with more conviction early in the second
half. Asprilla was particularly dangerous, twice forcing diving
saves from goalie Filip de Wilde.
	   But the Belgians soon reestablished control of a bad-tempered
match that saw four Belgians and two Colombians receive yellow
cards.
	   In a battle of midfield veterans, the wild-haired Colombian
Carlos Valdarama, heading for this third World Cup, was largely
outshone by Enzo Scifo, on his way to his fourth.
	   Lineups:
	   Belgium: Filip de Wilde, Bertrand Crasson, Lorenzo Staelens,
Gordan Vidovic, Vital Borkelmans (Philippe Clement, 75th) Enzo
Scifo (Gert Verheyen, 77th), Danny Boffin, Franky Van der Elst,
Marc Wilmots (Glen De Boeck, 85th), Luc Nilis (Emile Mpenza, 77th),
Luis Oliveira (Mbo Mpenza, 85th).
	   Colombia: Oscar Cordoba, Ivan Ramiro Cordoba, Ever Palacios,
Jose Santa, Maurizio Serna, Anthony de Avila, (Adolfo Valencia,
65th) Harold Lozano, Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla, Wilmer
Carera, Freddy Rincon (Victor Aristizabal, 46th).

	   WITH no contentious issues to distract them, the national
delegates to the one-day MCA 45th annual general assembly on
Saturday kept their focus on the party's direction in helping the
country tackle its economic problems.
	   Is this the lull before the storm in view of the party elections
next year?
	   Judging from the proceedings, the delegates seemed to be sending
a strong signal of their endorsement to party leaders for adopting
several measures and commitment to maintain a strong, stable and
united MCA.
	   Political observers believe that under the leadership of Datuk
Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik and his team, the party is united and will
be able to weather and stave off a serious challenge from the
Opposition in the next general elections.
	   Having achieved its best electoral results in 1995, when the
party won 31 parliamentary and 73 State seats (including one in
Sabah), Dr Ling is expected to retain the team, or at the most opt
for only minor changes.
	   He said in an interview that the mandate given by the people to
MCA candidates in the last general election had been proven
correct.
	   ``Look at our elected representatives, they are working full
time to handle varied problems faced by the people and even bring
them up in parliament and State assemblies,'' Dr Ling said.
	   He took a dig at the DAP as a party which ``is consistently
critical, negative and destructive (CCND) and no action, talk only
(Nato)''.
	   He said the DAP thrived on issues associated with the present
economic downturn to survive.
	   Dr Ling also has a simple message to the party's elected
representatives: ``Work hard and even harder for the people who
have given you their support.''
	   As for the party elections, MCA deputy president Datuk Lim Ah
Lek had said at the MCA Youth assembly, held a day earlier, that
there should be minimal contests next year.
	   However, this did not mean that there should be no contest, he
said.
	   His message to the party members is to retain elected leaders
who have worked hard and to weed out those non-performing leaders
through the democratic process.
	   At the party's assembly, what was even more conspicuous this
time, were the unity and the attendance of political friends and
foes of yesteryears.
	   Such acts of conciliation and letting bygones be bygones were
obvious with the presence of past party leaders, who were engaged
in the infamous party crisis of the early 80s.
	   Among those who came were party life president Tan Sri Lee San
Choon, Tan Koon Swan, Datuk Dr Neo Yee Pan, Datuk Lee Kim Sai,
Datuk Kee Yong Wee, Tan Sri Chong Hon Nyan, Datuk Wong Seng Chow,
Tun Omar Yoke Lin Ong, Tan Sri Lee Siok Yew, Datuk Tan Cheng Swee,
Datuk Lew Sip Hon, Datuk Chan Kit Chee, Datuk Dr Tan Tiong Hong,
Datuk Kam Woon Wah and Datuk Yeoh Kian Teik, a former Perak Youth
chief and father of James Bond girl, Michelle Yeoh.
	   Their presence even prompted the guest-of-honour Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is also the Barisan Nasional
chairman, to make some comments before he delivered his speech.
	   His remark that most politicians faded away when they no longer
held party or government positions (Umno not excluded), has given
much food for thought.
	   Lest we forget, Dr Mahathir had on many occasions reminded such
politicians that they were given the opportunity to continue
playing their role in national development through political
vehicles.
	   Besides this show of unity by the MCA, there also appeared to be
a total absence of lobbying among the elected representatives in
preparations for the party elections next year.
	   Issues related to the economic problems stole the limelight.
	   Even Dr Ling's presidential address was focused on the premise
of the party's political agenda to help the country overcome the
economic problems in the shortest possible time.
	   The MCA chief reiterated the party's commitment to continue the
``Love Malaysia, Buy Local Products'' campaign and the need to keep
our ringgit from leaving the country with his repeated exhortations
of study locally, save in local banks, visit local tourist
destinations and buy local products.
	   The assembly also saw the smooth passage of four amendments to
the party constitution which included the increase in the number of
Wanita delegates to the general assembly, expand the central
committee and endorsing a formula to keep the number of national
delegates at a manageable number.

Khatami plans to visit New York, address United Nations

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought a
more moderate course for Iran since his election a year ago, plans
to go to the United States to address the U.N. General Assembly in
September, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Referring to the planned address as a ``very important speech,''
the official said Khatami would discuss the position of Muslims in
the world and in the United Nations.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Khatami would urge the United Nations to give Islamic nations a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
	   The statement was the first announcement of the planned trip,
though such a visit had been rumored for days. The trip would
require U.S. government permission, but this is never refused to a
head of state.
	   Breaking through nearly 20 years of hostility, Khatami called
for a dialogue with Americans and more cultural and educational
exchanges in a broadcast interview last January.
	   Two previous Iranian presidents have addressed the United
Nations since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but both used their
speeches to attack the United States. Khatami could instead make a
gesture to American leaders.
	   Khatami will also use his trip to meet the 2 million strong
Iranian community in the United States, the official said. Many
Iranians fled their country to settle in the United States and
other Western countries after the revolution.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.

	   DEPUTY Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Dr
Ibrahim Saad has joined Bandar Tun Razak MP Datuk Tan Chai Ho in
calling for a separate water authority for the Federal Territory.
	   He said although the city's water supply came from dams in
Selangor, a separate authority would mean better service to the
public.
	   ``There must be a separate body to oversee the distribution and
supply of water in the Federal Territory especially when there is a
shortage.''
	   Ibrahim said the absence of an authority in the Federal
Territory to co- ordinate the distribution of water and to liaise
with the Selangor Waterworks Department was especially felt in
times of crisis.
	   Tan had earlier urged the authorities to establish an
independent water authority in Kuala Lumpur to facilitate water
distribution.
	   On building owners in the city who ignored City Hall's call to
paint their premises, Ibrahim said he deplored their lackadaisical
attitude.
	   He said City Hall had issued letters of appeal and request
notices to building owners to spruce up their premises for the
Commonwealth Games.
	   ``But after today's tour of the city, I feel that not many have
taken our appeals to heart,'' he added.
	   He said that if building owners were unable to repaint due to
financial contraints, they should at least white-wash the exterior
so that it looked presentable. Ibrahim also said preparations for
the Games were not just the responsibility of City Hall or the
Federal Government but also that of the general public.
	   Asked what form of action would be taken against defiant
building owners, Ibrahim said there was nothing much City Hall
could do but plead for co-operation.

	   Many Chinese Indonesians can tell stories of how their assets
were destroyed or in some cases their safety targeted by the mobs
in the recent riots that hit Jakarta and several other cities in
Indonesia.
	   So, I found Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo's letter criticizing Chinese
Indonesians that fled the country during the rioting to be unfair.
After all, nobody knew at the time that the transfer of power was
going to take place peacefully.
	   On the other hand, I would support the calls by others for
Chinese Indonesians to put more effort into assimilating with
indigenous people. I also call on the authorities to take more
concrete steps to address the issue. Furthermore it is important to
improve national security because if people do not feel safe they
will not return to do their business as usual.
	   There have been accounts of loss of lives, assets and jobs due
to the riots. However, few have mentioned the long-term impact of
the loss of confidence and higher risk perceived by people. This
will result in more capital and even skilled people leaving and
fewer coming to Indonesia at a time when the country badly needs
the expertise and capital.
	   Even when things stabilize further, investors in general will be
less inclined to put their money into businesses which are
long-term in nature. This will significantly handicap Indonesia in
its bid to be a competitive economy in the 21st century. The stakes
are just too big for the issue to be ignored.

	   READY, GET SET, GO ... Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Kamaruzzaman
Sharif flagging off participants in the ``Midnite Run''
commemorating the 100-day countdown to the Kuala Lumpur 1998
Commonwealth Games at City Hall last night.
	   About 500 participants, including 200 trainees from the Police
Training Centre in Jalan Gurney, ran the four kilometres from Jalan
Raja Laut heading towards Chow Kit before turning back to Jalan
Tuanku Abdul Rahman and finishing at the starting point.
	   Also present were Sukom Ninety-Eight Berhad chief operating

	   ``The Midnite Run is to remind Malaysians that the Games are
only 100 days away.
	   ``This is among many events that we hope will ignite the Games

Kamaruzzaman said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli and Syrian negotiators met for the
first time in more than two years this week in the United States,
Israel TV reported Wednesday.
	   The TV said three Israeli negotiators and three Syrian
representatives including the Syrian ambassador to Washington Walid
Moualem held four days of meetings at a think tank run by former
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III in Houston, Texas.
	   ``There was never any meeting. There wasn't even a handshake,''
Moualem said in Washington. ``I just gave a lecture in which I
spoke about the necessity of resuming the talks (with Israel) from
where we left off.''
	   Israel TV said Baker and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk were both present at the meetings which dealt with a
return to the negotiating table both sides left over two years ago.
	   Syria wants the Golan Heights back, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast war, in exchange for a peace agreement. Talks on a
territorial compromise with Israel's previous Labor-led government
broke off in March 1996 and never resumed.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Syria to
returned to talks by has also said that Israel should retain
control over the strategic heights for security reasons.
	   Israel TV said the secret talks this week in Houston were
attended by Netanyahu's chief policy aide Uzi Arad, Itamar
Rabinovitch, a former ambassador and negotiator with Syria and
reserve general Uzi Sagay.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The decision by the Kelantan Government to
ban dikir barat performances may affect tourist arrivals to
Malaysia as arts and culture are among the main attractions.
	   Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik said
though it was too early to determine the impact of the ban, many
foreigners came to Malaysia because of her mix of culture.
	   ``Logically, if the attractions are no longer available, they
will not come,'' he said after launching Mystical Malaysia, a local
travel, leisure and lifestyle magazine at Menara Kuala Lumpur.
	   The magazine, published by BN  Associates, will be circulated
monthly with about 280,000 copies.
	   The Kelantan Government imposed the ban last week on grounds
that some quarters were found to have abused the permits issued to
them to hold dikir barat performances by including other forms of
entertainment which contradicted Islamic teachings.
	   However, Sabbaruddin said promotions carried out by the ministry
would still have references to dikir barat as the performance was
not banned in other States.
	   On the huge outflow of funds through tourism, Sabbaruddin said
he was confident the amount, at RM7.6 billion last year, could be
reduced following various measures taken by the Government,
including promotions to encourage domestic tourism.
	   He said the depreciation of the ringgit had made travelling
overseas more expensive and this might lead more Malaysians to
spend their holidays in the country.
	   Sabaruddin agreed that packages to some foreign destinations
like Medan in Indonesia were much cheaper than domestic ones like
Kota Kinabalu, and this had to some extent discouraged Malaysians
from visiting local destinations.
	   However, to ensure fairness, he said several factors needed to
be taken into account when comparing the prices of local and
overseas tour packages.
	   ``For instance, the locals are willing to travel in groups to
benefit from discounted fare when going overseas but choose to
travel alone when holidaying locally.
	   ``They are also willing to put up at apartments when abroad but
elect to stay in five-star hotels when in the country.''
	   Earlier in his speech, Sabbaruddin said Malaysians often
perceived holidaying abroad as being more ``glamorous'' than
visiting local destinations.
	   Despite the many beautiful and historical attractions the
country had to offer, he said some Malaysians had never gone to
such places like Batu Caves and the National Park.
	   He added that publications like Mystical Malaysia would help
Malaysians realise their role in the country's tourism development.

	   THE Subang Jaya Municipal Council yesterday re-opened two major
openings at dividers along Jalan Tujuan which had been closed
earlier following complaints from SS18 and SS19 residents.
	   Subang Jaya State Assemblyman Lee Hwa Beng said the closure,
which was implemented from May 25, had caused massive jams as
motorists had to go further up Jalan Tujuan to make U-turns.
	   The dividers located at the SS19-SS17 and SS19-SS18 junctions
were removed to provide for a smoother flow along Jalan Tujuan
which is linked to the exit near the KFC outlet.
	   Motorists were not allowed to make right turns at these
junctions.
	   The council had wanted to reduce the openings along the road to
allow for a smoother traffic flow but the decision backfired when
motorists clogged up other parts of the road to make quick U-turns.
	   The council is also studying the feasibility of constructing a
RM1.5 million ramp to link Jalan Tujuan to SS19. A firm had been
appointed to make a study and design the ramp.

Seven-year stretch: Bulls eye second three-peat AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Seven years ago, Michael Jordan sat
weeping at his father's side, cradling his first National
Basketball Association championship trophy as if it were a
long-lost child.
	   He couldn't and he wouldn't let it go.
	   Losing seasons were behind him. So were the bruising losses to
the Detroit Pistons, who for years denied the Chicago Bulls a shot
at the title Jordan needed to define his career.
	   ``I'm very proud for the team. I'm very proud for my family,''
he said through tears that summer day in 1991 after vanquishing the
Los Angeles Lakers. ``We finally capped it off after seven years.''
	   Now, in what might be his final season, Jordan wants another
title. At the team's practice facility in suburban Chicago, the
Bulls built a case to hold their trophies. Five _ three straight
before Jordan went away for most of two years to play baseball, and
now two more in a row _ and counting.
	   Most of the names have changed. Will Perdue, Bill Cartwright,
John Paxson, Scott Williams, Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong are
gone.
	   Paxson, whose outside shooting helped conquer the Lakers, made
the 3-pointer that sank the Phoenix Suns in 1993, clinching the
first three-peat. Grant blocked a last-second shot to preserve the
victory.
	   A little-used reserve named Bobby Hansen made a 3-pointer to
begin an amazing fourth-quarter run as the Bulls rallied from 15
down to polish off Portland in 1992. That was ``the shrug'' series,
a gesture Jordan made after hitting six 3-pointers in one half.
Even he couldn't believe it.
	   Now, Jordan and longtime sidekick Scottie Pippen lead a new
supporting cast _ Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler, Toni
Kukoc, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown.
	   ``You just continue to try to build on your legacy and hopefully
one day you can look back and cherish it and realize something you
did was very special,'' Pippen said.
	   ``But as you go through it, you don't look at it and weep over
it. Just try to carry on. I don't see this happening again in the
near future.''
	   Kerr, like Paxson, hit the game-clinching shot last season _ on
a pass from Jordan _ as the Bulls outlasted Utah in six games. The
season before, Dennis Rodman provided the spark as the Bulls beat
Seattle, capping the best regular-season record ever, 72-10.
	   The victory over the Sonics marked Jordan's first championship
since his comeback and his first without his father, who had been
murdered two years earlier.
	   When the buzzer sounded and the series was over, Jordan
collapsed on the floor, again in tears, as he clutched the ball.
Appropriately, it was Father's Day.
	   Facing the Jazz again this season, the Bulls see similarities to
their matchup against the Suns. They are shooting for a third
straight championship, they are without home-court advantage and
they are facing a talented opponent. There are contrasts, too.
	   ``The '93 team was totally different. We had a team together
seven or eight years,'' Jordan said.
	   ``We went basically from bottom and got to the top. This team is
built on three specialties (Jordan, Pippen and Rodman) and everyone
else complements that. We haven't been together as long but yet
we've had this much success,'' he said.
	   ``This is different. The reliability is not quite the same,
although it's good now. You can't compare it to the '93 team.''
	   But the Bulls can be compared to the greatest teams. They can't
match the 16 titles of the Boston Celtics or 11 from the
Minneapolis-Los Angeles Lakers. But they have dominated the '90s
when Jordan played.
	   ``What we tried to do is keep thinking each one is unique and
special and not get wrapped up in the idea that `ho-hum, it's
another finals,''' Bulls coach Phil Jackson said.
	   ``We savor it and make it a unique feeling. It is something we
will value and treasure. It's something that is done once in a
lifetime. It's happened to us six times, so for us it's six times
in a lifetime.''

	   SENAFE, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian artillery fire echoed in
Eritrean valleys Wednesday, and black smoke curled from villages
abandoned by frightened farmers and their families.
	   Officials in both Horn of Africa countries accused each other of
cross-border attacks, dimming hopes for a peaceful solution to
their border dispute.
	   Hundreds of Eritrean soldiers marched towards defensive
positions, while pickup trucks loaded with lightly wounded troops
returned from the front to a village near Senafe, about 80
kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Asmara.
	   No other details were available on casualties from Wednesday's
attacks.
	   Ethiopia first made public the border dispute on May 13, calling
on Eritrea to withdraw from occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of illegally occupying a
415-square-kilometer (160-square-mile) area known as the Yirga
triangle in northwestern Ethiopia, plus a half-dozen smaller areas
along the border. But the underlying causes of the conflict are
economic, diplomats and businessmen say.
	   Eritrea accused Ethiopia of using tanks and heavy artillery in
an attack early Wednesday on the frontier village of Ambesete
Geleba, 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the capital, Asmara.
	   The Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Ethiopia of
provoking ``a new and dangerous escalation'' of the border crisis,
and said it was the fourth attack in less than two weeks on
Eritrean positions.
	   Hours later, Ethiopian accused Eritrean troops of attacking near
Aiga and Alitena, about 20 kilometers (10 miles) on the Ethiopian
side of a natural border formed by the Mereb River.
	   ``Eritrea thought it could get away with shifting the blame to
Ethiopia,'' the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   However, Ethiopia's state-run radio accused Eritrea of publicly
executing three Ethiopian civilians it said were abducted by
Eritrean troops during an earlier cross-border raid.
	   Another 30 civilians were in the custody of the Eritrean army
and their fate was unknown, said Kiros Bitow, a local official. He
said about 24,700 Ethiopians had been displaced in the Badme and
Sheraro areas following Eritrean invasions.
	   In the Eritrean village of Forpo, examinations were canceled
because students were too frightened by distant explosions to
concentrate, said their teacher, Sampson, who gave no last name.
	   Villagers, who declined to be named, reported hearing incoming
and outgoing heavy artillery fire.
	   Eritrea on Wednesday repeated a call for a total
demilitarization of border areas and outside mediation to solve the
dispute. Ethiopia said it was cooperating with peace negotiators.
	   For the past two weeks, U.S. diplomats and regional leaders have
shuttled between the two countries in a desperate effort to restore
peace that has showed no signs of success.
	   Both countries have consistently denied invading the other's
territory.
	   The Eritreans gained formal independence in 1993 after helping
Ethiopian rebels end 17 years of harsh military rule in Ethiopia.
	   Relations between the one-time allies in a long war against the
former Marxist government of Ethiopia soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November, triggering a trade war
that has hurt both economies and reduced cross-border commerce to a
trickle.

	   IPOH-born singer Manivvanan never dreamt that he would one day
be considered one of the most popular Indian singers here. After
all, he was more interested in making it big as a sportsman.
	   Back then as a pupil in Sekolah Menengah Sultan Abdul Samad, he
was, in fact, in awe of friends who could sing.
	   ``One day, while watching a school concert, I got drawn by the
whole thing and decided to give it a go by entering a singing
contest held in conjunction with Teachers Day,'' said Mannivvanan,
eldest among four children.
	   The song, Zuraidah (popularised by veteran Azman Idris) got him
the top prize in the contest, much to his surprise, and it was then
that he started to think of taking up singing as a career.
	   His parents, who were singers themselves, fully supported his
dream.
	   After completing his SPM, Manivvanan attended an RTM audition in
Ipoh.
	   ``My first radio appearance was in the Tamil musical programme
Isei Kadhambam, back in 1991. I sang a duet with popular singer
Susheela Menon.''
	   This opened the door for him to appear in radio and television
shows as well as in shows performances.
	   ``One of the memorable moments of my career was when I released
a compilation of popular Tamil numbers with a different music
arrangement.''
	   Manivvanan sang five solo songs in the album which was released
by Fantasia Music City in 1995. They included songs Style Style, Oh
Priya and Rakku Muthu Rakku.
	   ``Another significant event was when I was selected by RTM to
deliver Malaysia Sejahtera and Dunia IT. The songs, screened every
night by TV1 and TV2, also features Siti Nurhaliza, Amelina,
Sughanti Perumal, Nassier Wahab, Nora and Rahmat. I really cherish
the experience,'' he said.
	   Mannivvanan's future plans include recording a sentimental pop
album.
	   ``Recording a Malay album will also prove that I am equally
capable of singing such songs,'' he said.
	   He is now working on a Tamil album with another singer, Jeeva.
	   ``I had wanted to do this album for some time. We are still
finalising details like the concept, producer, composers and the
distribution company.
	   ``I known Jeeva for a long time and our voices are compatible.
The album will feature two of my own compositions,'' he said.
	   Manivvanan will be appearing at two big concerts in Petaling
Jaya and his hometown Ipoh, at the end of the year.
	   The concerts, organised by his close friend K. Radhakrishnan,
will also feature Jeeva, Sughanti Perumal Shobana Nair, Ramani,
Ismail and Sashi.
	   Manivvanan has received several offers for television dramas in
Tamil and Bahasa Malaysia, but is waiting for the right time before
making his TV debut.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The death of four Trisakti University students
last May 12 motivated students to escalate their campaign for total
reform. In the same way as Arief Rachman Hakim, a University of
Indonesia student who was shot to death by the military in 1966,
the four became martyrs and heroes for political reform.
	   In the two days after the shooting, there were massive riots in
Jakarta and its surrounding satellite towns of Bekasi and
Tangerang.
	   These were the worst riots in Indonesia's modern political
history. Rumors making the rounds were plenty. One said the riots
were the work of some military officers who wanted to imitate what
their predecessors did during the Malari Affair in 1974, when they
ordered hoodlums to loot and burn shopping centers in Senen,
Central Jakarta.
	   Their intention was to deceive the public into believing that
the riots were committed by students; thus, the public would
condemn students and would not support their demonstration for
total reform. The politics of scapegoating the students was
unsuccessful.
	   Another rumor said they were organized by the military as an
excuse for their chief commander, Gen. Wiranto, to stop student
demonstrations.
	   Others speculated the riots were part of a power struggle among
the military elite.
	   Another story had it they were organized to demolish symbols of
development of Soeharto's regime.
	   The deaths of the students and the riots did not quash the
students' determination to topple Soeharto as a precondition for
total reform.
	   For the second time in Indonesia's young history, a student
movement succeeded in forcing the president out of office. This
time it was the most powerful man in Indonesia who had ruled with
an iron fist for 32 years.
	   Several factors forced Soeharto to make the decision:
	   The occupation of the House building by thousands of students.
They were willing to sacrifice their lives rather than leave the
building without Soeharto's resignation. The Armed Forces (ABRI)
accommodative attitude toward students during their demonstrations
boosted their spirit to topple Soeharto.
	   Soeharto failed to reshuffle his Cabinet in time, and 14 of his
ministers resigned.
	   It seems probable Gen. Wiranto told Soeharto that ABRI could not
support him any more.
	   There may have also been several external factors which
contributed to expedite Soeharto's downfall, such as the delay in
disbursement of International Monetary Fund's bailout contribution
for Indonesia and the indirect support for student movements in the
country.
	   In a way, these May student demonstrations in Indonesia can be
regarded as a middle class revolution. Compared to previous student
movements, this year's student movements were supported by almost
all sections of society, particularly the middle class. Their
support came in the form of money, food, printing materials,
T-shirts, encouraging public opinion, organizing short courses to
enhance students' critical ability, musical entertainment and
others.
	   The middle class' help for the students can be divided into five
categories:
	   First, those who had genuine motives for political and economic
reforms or the true believers. They spent a lot of money to assist
student demonstrations, without any political or economic interests
except total reforms.
	   Second, former student activists who had tried to topple
Soeharto's regime for more than 24 years and who were eager to end
the dictatorship in Indonesia.
	   Third, those who were unhappy with the Soeharto's family
business activities since the beginning of the economic crisis in
July 1997, either because they lost their jobs or they could not
compete with crony capitalists who were close to Soeharto's family.
	   Fourth, the newcomers or ``free riders'' who jumped on the
bandwagon just before Soeharto's downfall.
	   Fifth, former Soeharto's cronies and aides who wanted to ``wash
their hands'' to show to the people that they were clean and eager
to dissociate themselves from corruption, nepotism and collusion.
Students call this group ``last-minutes heroes'' or ``eleventh hour
heroes''.
	   Although Soeharto has lost his power, students and civilian
political elites still continue their demands for total reform.
Many have never accepted Habibie as Soeharto's successor, because
Habibie was very close to Soeharto and he is still considered part
of the problem, a leader whose managerial capability to handle the
present political and economic crisis still needs to be tested.
	   Some legal experts believe the transfer of power from Soeharto
to Habibie was illegal or unconstitutional. In other words, the
nation shows increasing signs of polarization over Habibie
presidency and his cabinet. Students are also divided between those
who support Habibie and those who still oppose him.
	   The aftermath of Soeharto's resignation can be regarded as a
period of struggle for powers among political elites, without
considering social and economic conditions.
	   Today, many former Soeharto cronies are forming new political
parties as if, in this new era of political reform, people are free
enough to do that without any consideration that their actions will
endanger the nation's unity and stability.
	   It seems their understanding of the liberal democratic system
was very limited. Unless statesmanship grows at the heart of
Indonesia's political elite, this country will inadvertently be
torn to pieces.
	   The present situation also sees a psychological war between
military and civilian elites. While the civilian political elite is
still screaming about total reform without any agreement on the
future reform agenda, the military are preparing drafts of
political development after Soeharto.
	   The military elite is also trying to show to the people that
they are humble and accommodative toward the civilian elite who
demand total reform.
	   Minister of Information Yunus Yosfiah's handling of the problem
of the free press in Indonesia is an example of how ABRI approaches
journalists.
	   In addition, ABRI Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs, Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono, showed the accommodative approach in dealing
with the people and political elite.
	   The elite can still discuss political reform in cafes and
hotels. The elite can also afford to think about ``what menus will
we pick to eat from today?'', while the common people who live from
one day to another ponder ``what will we eat today?''.
	   Unless the civilian elite take the people's stomachs into
consideration, it is possible the grassroots groups will shift
their allegiance from the civilian to the military elite in the
next six months or so.
	   Although it is hard to believe at present, it is not impossible
that the military will dominate the government because the civilian
political elite cannot cope with the present economic and political
crisis.
	   The writer is a researcher at the Center for Political and
Regional Studies, Indonesian Institute of Sciences.
	   Window: In a way, these May student demonstrations in Indonesia
can be regarded as a middle class revolution. Compared to previous
student movements, this year's student movements were supported by
almost all sections of society, particularly the middle class.

	   Megawati Soekarnoputri, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding president Sukarno and chairwoman of the unrecognized
Indonesian Democratic Party, has managed to impress many of us
again by calling on all Indonesians to stop defiling fallen
president Soeharto. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the day on
which the nation's state philosophy Pancasila was born -- June 1,
1945 -- Megawati said defiling former leaders of the state runs
against Pancasila which, among other things, advocates ``just and
civilized humanitarianism''. ``Do we have to replace our state
leaders through such treatment every time?'' Megawati asked her
audience of several thousand, obviously referring to her own
father's ouster by Soeharto in 1966.
	   To be fair, Megawati is not the only, or even the first,
opposition leader to have called for temperance in the public
airing of anti-Soeharto sentiments following the strongman's forced
retirement on May 21. Moslem leader Amien Rais made a similar
appeal two days earlier and we can be sure that the same spirit of
moderation and forgiveness exists among many others of the more
reasonable and more mature of Indonesia's opposition leaders.
	   What makes Megawati's appeal for moderation worth noting is the
fact that it was made by the daughter of the deposed president
Sukarno, a victim of almost identical circumstances which led to
the birth of the New Order, headed by Soeharto. Unlike other
opposition figures who have made similar appeals, Megawati and her
family endured the same agony of being publicly defiled when her
father, Sukarno, was ousted in the wake of the communist coup of
1965.
	   Even after so many years, a sense of injury, perhaps even more
than magnanimity, can be detected in the question she asked her
audience: ``Do we have to treat former president Soeharto's family
the way the nation treated us, Sukarno's family, in 1965?'' But
apart from deep personal insight coming from experience, Megawati
probably also remembered and appreciated the way Soeharto had in
public always continued to accord Sukarno the respect he deserved
as a founder of the nation.
	   'Mikul duwur mendem jero', which literally means carry your
elders high and bury them deep, is a saying that is still honored
by many Indonesians, the Javanese in particular. Megawati could
only be observing this dictum when she made her appeal for
Indonesians to stop bashing Soeharto. Indonesia's younger
generation could see in this old tradition of chivalry a useful
modern guide to engaging in politics without abandoning morality --
a useful general principle to remember if democracy is to survive
and bloom. It is important, however, at this point to remember that
civility must not stand in the way of justice.
	   At this stage of developments, the public clamor concerns the
wealth which Soeharto and his family are widely reported to have
amassed during his more than three decades in power. The public's
demands that this wealth be returned to the state in as far as it
has been illegally acquired must in this context be given the
proper attention they deserve. Just as much as the Soeharto clan,
or their associates, have a right to be treated fairly, so the
people have a right to reclaim what belongs to them.
	   Indonesians at this stage of their country's history need the
guidance of leaders who are not only sincerely committed to the
cause of overall reform, but who are also mature and sensible
enough to see the nation safely through these critical times. It is
in this context that the calls for Indonesians to stop the Soeharto
bashing must be seen as a welcome development.

	   MEET Tampin's M-Team - the name adopted by a group of elderly
Sikh and Indian mothers in Tampin.
	   As part of their on-going programme to promote goodwill and
bring cheer to mothers, the group meets regularly and organises
various functions.
	   These include inventing new recipes, staging down-memory-lane
fashion shows, cultural songs and music performances and, believe
it or not, even trying out disco numbers! And recently the M-Team
got together to mark Mothers' Day and name the Tampin Mother of the
Year.
	   The honour went to 70-year-old Madam Harbans Kaur who has
devoted a major part of her life to carrying out charity work.
	   And how did the M-Team choose her?
	   Said M-Team secretary, Gurdeep Kaur: ``Since we shortlisted 20
mothers for the award, we decided to put all their names in a pot
and got a person to pick one name.''

Iranian judges order retrials for journalist and German on death row 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES lead with journalist also getting retrial
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian judges have ordered retrials for a
German businessman and an Iranian journalist who were condemned to
death, state-run media reported Wednesday.
	   The retrials mean that the death sentences against Helmut Hofer,
a German businessman convicted of having sex with an Iranian woman,
and Morteza Firoozi, an Iranian journalist convicted of espionage
and adultery, have been set aside. New courts will issue their own
verdicts and, if necessary, sentences.
	   The chief justice's spokesman, Ali Abbassifard, said a new trial
had been ordered for Hofer because he says he converted to Islam
before the incident occurred, state-run radio reported. The retrial
has already started.
	   In the case of Firoozi, Abbassifard said the supreme court had
``major objections'' to his conviction, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   In January, an Iranian court sentenced Hofer, 54, to death after
convicting him of violating Iranian law by having sex with a
26-year-old medical student, who was Muslim while he was not.
	   Bonn has warned Tehran that if Hofer is executed, German-Iranian
relations would deteriorate. Germany is Iran's biggest trading
partner in the Europe Union.
	   Last month, the chief justice, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, said
Hofer's case would be reviewed by the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court refused an appeal by Firoozi on May 10, the
Iran News reported.
	   Few details of Firoozi's case have emerged, but Yazdi said
earlier this year that the journalist had been convicted of spying
and several sexual offenses. Adultery and espionage are punishable
by death under Iranian law.
	   Firoozi, 40, is a former editor of the Iran News. He has been
detained since May 1997.
	   While there is no evidence that the government has influenced
the decisions to retry Hofer and Firoozi, President Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate who took office in August, is known to favor
fewer death sentences than previous presidents.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian Rowing Association pledged
yesterday to soldier on with preparations for the 13th Asian Games
despite financial and practice facility deficiencies.
	   Head coach Budiman Setiawan said his 16 recruits had trained in
a modest course at Jatiluhur reservoir in Purwakarta, West Java,
since mid-February, but he was delighted by their enthusiasm and
achievements.
	   ``Some rowers managed to clock their best time of six minutes
and 33 seconds in double sculls, a few seconds faster than their
strongest opponents from China,'' an elated Budiman said after a
meeting with the National Sports Council's training director
Muhammad Hindarto.
	   He added that in general the rowers improved on marks they set
en route to winning last year's Southeast Asian Games by 10
seconds.
	   ``To row in an undefined course is difficult but our athletes
proved they could manage to clock fine times. I hope they will
perform better in an international race like Asiad,'' said Budiman,
who is also the rowing body's general secretary.
	   He said the training center would be moved to a better equipped
facility belonging to the Army's special force in Batujajar, near
Bandung, as soon the rowers returned from the Merlion Cup in
Singapore this week.
	   A team of 10 rowers departed later yesterday for the event,
which takes place from tomorrow to Sunday.
	   It will be the rowers' first outing since undergoing the
centralized training program. Budiman said they would compete in
more regattas in August.
	   He predicted his team would dominate the competition thanks to
the absence of the continent's rowing powerhouses China, South
Korea and Kazakhstan.
	   Earlier, Hindarto asked the national rowing team to take full
advantage of the tryout to build their belief in themselves.
	   ``Many of our athletes have failed to win in international
competitions because they lack self-confidence.''
	   Indonesia has named rowing as one of the sports it will compete
in at the Asian Games in Bangkok in December.

Kohl cancels rest of Italian visit to return home 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Germany-Train Derails
<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Shaken by the news of at least 100 deaths
in the rail accident in northern Germany, German leader Helmut Kohl
decided to hurry home Wednesday night, shortly after arriving in
Italy for talks with Italian Premier Romano Prodi.
	   ``So many dead....It's a tragedy. Excuse me, but I must return
home right away,'' Kohl, his face tight, said, with Prodi at his
side, as the two leaders went to meet over dinner in a restaurant
outside Bologna.
	   The two men were scheduled to have their talks on Thursday, part
of periodic consulations between the two countries.
	   But because of the tragedy, the leaders decided to move up the
schedule to a dinner-time session Wednesday evening, with Kohl to
leave for Germany right after the talks.
	   Kohl asked journalists to understand that ``I must and I want to
return home because in this moment my thoughts go to the families
of the victims,'' the ANSA news agency quoted him as saying.
	   ``I hope comfort can be found in prayer,'' another Italian news
agency, AGI reported Kohl as saying. ``I'm going back to do all
that is in my possibility to do.''
	   Prodoi told Kohl that Italy was close to Germany in this moment
of grief just as Germany was a few weeks ago, when more than 150
people were killed by mudslides in the Italian south.

	   PORT DICKSON, Tues. - Federal and State Government agencies,
given the task to undertake economic projects under the Development
Programme for the Hardcore Poor (PPRT), must ensure their
successful implementation.
	   Rural Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa said yesterday
those responsible should closely monitor the implementation of the
projects and ensure that the allocation provided by the ministry
benefit the hardcore poor participants.
	   He said those responsible, including district officers, must
personally check on the progress of the projects being carried out.
	   ``We don't want to see projects as being a success on paper but
on inspection, they don't show the desired results,'' he added.
	   According to him, it was the ministry's policy now that the
minister, deputy minister, parliamentary secretary,
director-general and other senior ministry officials had to visit
the PPRT projects to see what was happening to the allocation given
by the Government.
	   Annuar said this after visiting a mussel rearing project in
Kuala Lukut today as part of his day-long visit to several PPRT
projects in Negri Sembilan.
	   Present were Chembong Assemblyman Firdaus Harun and Port Dickson
district officer Hassan Nawawi Abdul Rahman.
	   Annuar added that the implementing agencies should also conduct
in-depth studies of the projects proposed to ensure their
viability.

Exemptions for certain wastes, NEW STRAITS TIMES-MANAGEMENT TIMES

	   PETALING JAYA, Tues. - Industries can ask for exemption from
stringent compliance in handling certain harzardous wastes if they
can prove it would not pose a threat to the environment.
	   Thus, they can ask for the removal of certain substances from
the scheduled wastes list under proposed amendments to the
Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations, 1989.
	   A Department of Environment officer said specific requests would
be approved where justified, and confined to certain processes
under a new concept of petition proposed under the amendments.
There will be no blanket approval.
	   If a request is granted, the industry does not have to go
through stringent compliance procedures when handling and disposing
of hazardous wastes.
	   The handling, storage and movement of all scheduled wastes
listed under the regulations are controlled and monitored by the
Department of Environment. The regulations are being reviewed for
the DOE to introduce more stringent control over hazardous waste
management.
	   The officer said the petition concept was being practised in the
United States and that even the Basel Convention on the Control of
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal had
a review mechanism for listed wastes.
	   ``Experience has shown that certain things need to be excluded.
For instance, sludge is a scheduled waste because it contains heavy
metal.
	   ``If tests revealed that the content of heavy metal is
insignificant, it need not go through stringent procedures,'' he
said in an interview at the Towards a Better Understanding of Waste
Management in Malaysia seminar.
	   The half-day seminar is organised by the Malaysian Plastics
Manufacturers Association's Plastic Waste Management Task Force.
	   The DOE is also planning to create a new list under the
regulations for wastes deemed ``less hazardous'' such as asbestos,
low heavy metal sludges and calcium hydroxide sludge.
	   The movement of these wastes will still be controlled but they
do not have to be disposed of at a secured landfill, like other
scheduled wastes.
	   ``They can be disposed of at landfills of lower standard.
	   ``Some of these wastes can be sent to recovery facilities. One
example is gypsum, a new scheduled waste, which can be recycled to
make partition boards,'' said the officer.
	   Other amendments include imposing a time limit on factories
wanting to store scheduled wastes on their premises.
	   The DOE is proposing to limit the duration to 180 days, after
which the factories will have either to treat the wastes or send
them for disposal at secured landflls such as Kualiti Alam Sdn
Bhd's integrated scheduled waste management plant at Bukit Nanas.
	   Factories are currently permitted to store self-generated
scheduled wastes, with no time limit, provided they have a licence
from the DOE.
	   DOE director-general Rosnani Ibarahim who launched the seminar
said the department was also reviewing the existing list of
scheduled wastes to harmonise it with the Basel Convention list.
	   The convention's Fourth Conference of Parties (COP) in Kuching
in March came up with new lists of wastes which clearly defined
hazardous materials that needed to be banned.
	   She said the proposed amendments would take several more months
before they could be implemented.
	   DOE will have to discuss the matter with Kualiti Alam before
enforcing the amendments as the treatment plant has limited
capacity. Other aspects to consider include existing accumulated
waste and the amount generated annually.
	   There is a backlog in the amount of scheduled waste that needs
to be cleared and industries must be given time to comply with the
new amendments.
	   Rosnani said the construction of the Bukit Nanas treatment plant
was on schedule and it would be launched next month.

Battling Belgians win 2-0 to compound Colombia's woes 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium demolished Colombia 2-0
Wednesday with a display of rugged determination and tight teamwork
that added to the South American's pre-World Cup woes.
	   Defeat in a rain-soaked King Baudouin Stadium followed
Colombia's 3-1 mauling by Germany Saturday and disappointing draws
against Scotland and Chile.
	   By contrast, Belgium, going into its fifth consecutive World Cup
finals, is looking better with every game.
	   The Belgian defense blunted the attacking thrust of Faustino
Asprilla and Freddy Rincon and flashes of brilliance from Luc Nilis
and Marc Wilmots belied the dour reputation of the ``Red Devils.''
	   ``The goals are coming,'' said Wilmots. ``We're playing very
fast, we're playing very well.''
	   Wilmots, who plays his club soccer at Germany's Schalke 04,
supplied the best moment of the match.
	   Roaming the wide, open spaces left by his Colombian markers, the
stylish midfielder picked up a loose ball some 25 meters (yards)
and rifled in a right foot shot that soared into the top corner of
the net beyond Oscar Cordoba's despairing dive for 2-0 in the 31st
minute.
	   Danny Boffin had already shown up the porous Colombian defense
in the 16th minute racing in unmarked to head home a Luis Oliveira
pass from pointblank range for 1-0.
	   Colombia struck back with more conviction early in the second
half. Asprilla was particularly dangerous, twice forcing diving
saves from goalie Filip de Wilde.
	   But the Belgians soon reestablished control of a bad-tempered
match that saw four Belgians and two Colombians receive yellow
cards.
	   In a battle of midfield veterans, the wild-haired Colombian
Carlos Valdarama, heading for this third World Cup, was largely
outshone by Enzo Scifo, on his way to his fourth.
	   Lineups:
	   Belgium: Filip de Wilde, Bertrand Crasson, Lorenzo Staelens,
Gordan Vidovic, Vital Borkelmans (Philippe Clement, 75th) Enzo
Scifo (Gert Verheyen, 77th), Danny Boffin, Franky Van der Elst,
Marc Wilmots (Glen De Boeck, 85th), Luc Nilis (Emile Mpenza, 77th),
Luis Oliveira (Mbo Mpenza, 85th).
	   Colombia: Oscar Cordoba, Ivan Ramiro Cordoba, Ever Palacios,
Jose Santa, Maurizio Serna, Anthony de Avila, (Adolfo Valencia,
65th) Harold Lozano, Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla, Wilmer
Carera, Freddy Rincon (Victor Aristizabal, 46th).

Uncertainty pushes stocks, rupiah down, JAKARTA POST

	   JAKARTA (JP): Shares and the rupiah continued to lose ground for
the second consecutive day yesterday, with stock prices on the
Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) down 3.4 percent.
	   Currency dealers said trading of the rupiah remained thin as
most market operators were discouraged by the country's political
uncertainty.
	   ``Some operators are questioning when and how the country will
hold its next poll next year,'' a chief dealer with a local private
bank said.
	   He said the rupiah closed at 11,650/11,850 to the U.S. dollar in
the spot market after touching a day low of 11,900 in the morning
session when a demonstration was held at the U.S. embassy here.
	   It was slightly lower than the 11,600 close the previous day.
	   Dealers said there was no reason for the rupiah to strengthen
against the dollar in the near future due to the country's gloomy
economic outlook and political uncertainty.
	   The rupiah is expected to weaken to 14,000 levels with positive
incentive in the market.
	   ``Trading activities were thin as most people are still waiting
for the release of the IMF-brokered loan package,'' the dealer
said.
	   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expected to disburse
the next US$1 billion part of its total $43 billion bailout package
this month to help the country in its dire economic situation.
	   ``The IMF loan is the only positive news for the country's
market,'' the dealer said.
	   The IMF's director for Asia Pacific, Hubert Neiss, was scheduled
to submit his report to the IMF executive director Michel Camdessus
last Monday. The fund's executive board will make a decision based
on the report.
	   Mirroring the sinking rupiah, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange (JSX) fell to 399.59 points on a total turnover of 148.48
million shares changing hands on the regular market worth Rp
175.45billion (US$15.25 million).
	   A broker with Bali Securities, Hendra Sunarto, said trading
activities remained sluggish throughout the day investors were
still worried about entering the country's market for political and
economic reasons.
	   He said stocks of companies linked to former president
Soeharto's family and the giant Salim Group conglomerate remained
under heavy selling pressure amid a backlash against the Soeharto
clan.
	   ``Most investors continued to discard the stocks to cut the
likelihood of more possible losses.''
	   He said foreign fund managers remained on the sidelines as major
foreign brokerage houses like SBC Warburg, WICarr and Merrill Lynch
securities continued to place large selling orders on the stocks.
	   The stock price of Bimantara Citra, controlled by Soeharto's
second eldest son Bambang Trihatmodjo, fell Rp 25 to Rp 325 on a
total turnover of 5.93 million shares, toll road operator PT Citra
Marga Nusaphala Persada (CMNP) closed unchanged at Rp 375 on 4.40
million shares, stock prices of noodle maker PT Indofood Sukses
Makmur shed Rp 425 to Rp 1,150 on a total turnover of 9.13 million
shares and the stock price of cement maker PT Indocement Tunggal
Perkasa slid Rp 25 to Rp 2,875 on 442,000 shares.
	   An analyst with a local securities firm said the country's
persistent political and economic uncertainty led most foreign fund
managers to keep their distance.
	   ``There is no reason for foreign fund managers to enter the
market. All they can do now is watch our political and economic
situation.''

	   JOHOR BARU, Tues. - The Royal Customs and Excise Department
seized more than five million units of smuggled audio visual and
multimedia equipment worth a total of about RM10 million during a
raid on a double-storey house in Taman Suria yesterday.
	   The seizure, which included computer software, compact discs and
video compact discs, is believed to be the single largest in the
country so far this year.
	   Five rooms were found to have been used to store the audio
visual equipment, some of which were packed for delivery to
potential clients.
	   Three men, including the suspected mastermind, all of whom were
believed to have been members of a gang, were detained during the
raid about 6pm.
	   State Customs Department director Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid said
today that with the seizure and arrests, the department had
crippled a major distribution, supply and storage network following
a month-long surveillance.
	   He said the department had been keeping tabs on the gang -
believed to have been operating since early this year - for the
past month.
	   ``We believe the gang smuggled the goods into the country for
distribution in the domestic market,'' he said.
	   Abdul Rahman added that in a follow-up operation more than four
hours later, they raided a shop at a shopping centre in Jalan Datuk
Sulaiman and seized 500 pornographic VCDs.
	   He said that while some computer software, such as CD Roms, were
not taxable items, they nonetheless, could only be brought into the
country with an import permit.
	   Abdul Rahman added that VCDs and CDs required a 20 per cent
import tax and a 10 per cent sales tax, as well as an import
permit.

	   PETALING JAYA, Tues. - Tomorrow's public forum on the current
water problem organised by the Federation of Malaysian Consumer
Associations has been called off after police withdrew the permit.
	   ``The reason given for the withdrawal, given on May 24, was
security reasons,'' Fomca president Prof Hamdan Adnan told a Press
conference at the Fomca headquarters today.
	   The forum, entitled ``Krisis Air Pada Masa Kini'' (Current Water
Crisis) was to be held at the Bandar Tun Razak Sports Complex at
8pm tomorrow.
	   Hamdan expressed disappointment at the development as he felt
the forum would have allowed the public to ask questions about the
current water problem and did not see it as a threat to security.
	   Hamdan said representatives of the Selangor Waterworks
Department, Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd, Indah Water Konsortium Sdn
Bhd and Umno Bandar Tun Razak division head Tamunir Mokhtar had
agreed to give talks at the forum.
	   However, the department and Puncak Niaga denied confirming their
presence at the forum.
	   Only IWK had agreed to send a representative while Hamdan said
Tamunir, although agreeing in the beginning, also declined to be
present later.
	   Hamdan said Fomca sent a letter to Inspector-General of Police
Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Noor today appealing for police to reverse
their decision.
	   ``We have also suggested that the title of the forum be changed
to `How to Save Water'.''
	   Failing this, Hamdan said Fomca would apply for a fresh permit
to hold a workshop on ways to save water.
	   Later, after an hour-long meeting with the department at its
headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Hamdan said Fomca could play the role
of a link between the authorities and consumers during the current
shortage.
	   Hamdan said the department had agreed to send the most current
information on the water problem to Fomca on a daily basis and
urged Fomca to work together with the department to overcome
difficulties resulting from the current water shortage.
	   The meeting, which was also attended by Selangor Umno Youth and
IWK, was initiated by the department and was held to explore ways
in which Fomca could play a role in assisting the department during
the current water situation.
	   Department director Che Mohamad Che Jusoh, when asked about
Fomca's public forum, declined to comment whether it was the policy
of the department to go to the public directly.

	   KOTA BARU, Tues. - The Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad will embark
on an aggressive campaign to promote the savings habit among those
eligible to invest in the Amanah Saham Bumiputera and Amanah Saham
Wawasan 2020.
	   ASNB marketing and investment services manager Hishamuddin Yahya
said the promotion drive aimed to attract 630,000 new unit holders
for the two trust funds by the end of the year.
	   He said the number of new subscribers were expected to bring in
RM24.3 million, of which RM20 million would come from new ASW2020
subscribers.
	   ``But our primary focus is to improve participation in the ASB
scheme to 97 per cent from the present 57 per cent from among
Bumiputeras eligible to invest in the unit trust.
	   ``We also hope to instil the habit of saving consistently in the
unit trusts,'' he told reporters at the campaign briefing today.
	   The national-level campaign will be launched by Permodalan
Nasional Berhad chairman Tan Sri Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid on
Thursday.

Israeli, Syrian negotiators meet for first time in two years to Israel and Syria; U.S. administration official

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Syrian and American officials denied an Israel
TV report Wednesday that negotiators had met for the first time to
discuss a resumption of Syrian-Israel peace talks.
	   The TV said three Israeli negotiators and three Syrian
representatives including the Syrian ambassador to Washington Walid
Moualem held four days of meetings at a think tank run by former
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III in Houston, Texas.
	   ``There was never any meeting. There wasn't even a handshake,''
Moualem said in Washington. ``I just gave a lecture in which I
spoke about the necessity of resuming the talks (with Israel) from
where we left off.''
	   Israel TV said Baker and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk were both present at the meetings which dealt with a
return to the negotiating table both sides left over two years ago.
	   Edward Djerejian, who served as a U.S. ambassador to both Israel
and Syria said both sides attended a conference at the James A.
Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
	   ``It did not constitute direct negotiations between the parties.
It was an opportunity for experts to look at the past, look where
we are now and explore options to move this Israeli-Syrian track
forward,'' he told The Associated Press in Houston.
	   A senior U.S. administration official, who asked that his name
not be used, said the event was an ``exchange of views on the peace
process.''
	   ``It's true that for the first time in a long time Syrians and
Israelis were in the same room, including government officials but
there was no negotiations,'' the official said.
	   Syria wants the Golan Heights back, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast war, in exchange for a peace agreement. Talks on a
territorial compromise with Israel's previous Labor-led government
broke off in March 1996 and never resumed.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Syria to
returned to talks by has also said that Israel should retain
control over the strategic heights for security reasons.
	   Israel TV said the secret talks this week in Houston were
attended by Netanyahu's chief policy aide Uzi Arad, Itamar
Rabinovitch, a former ambassador and negotiator with Syria and
reserve general Uzi Sagay.
	   Djerejian said the policy institute would release an analysis of
the Israeli-Syrian relationship and prospects for the future at the
end of the month. He said the conference was kept relatively secret
in order to ``maximize the substantive nature of the analytical
report and the recommendations'' to come.

	   ANGELS. Have you ever wondered about their existence? Do you
believe that there is an angel looking out for you even though you
can't see him or her?
	   Well, City Of Angels, a romance drama based on Wim Wenders'
highly-acclaimed German film Wings Of Desire, touches upon that
belief.
	   Released by Warner Bros, it stars Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan, Dennis
Franz and Andre Braugher and is directed by Brad Silberling.
	   But apart from being a tale about mortals and immortals, it is
also about matters of the heart and the sacrifices one makes for
love.
	   The story: Seth (Cage) is an angel (who is invisible and wears a
long, dark trench coat). His mission is to comfort and guide the
souls of the dead towards the light.
	   He is doing just that when he ``meets'' Dr Maggie Rice (Ryan), a
heart surgeon who suffers a life crisis when her patient dies in
the operating room.
	   There is something lovely and helpless about her that appeals to
this angel and he decides to help her overcome her emotional
turmoil. But in the process, Seth falls in love with her and
decides to make himself visible.
	   She meets this mysterious stranger and falls for him. though
Seth longs to be with her, he, as a celestial being, is also bound
by his heavenly duties.
	   The emotional entanglement between Seth and Maggie and the
on-screen chemistry between Cage and Ryan make this a ``must-see.''
	   ``I think we all feel that City Of Angels exhibits the pure
happiness in love and poetry in everyday things,'' Cage said in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times. ``We just have to take the
time to notice and appreciate them.''
	   ``From the minute I read the script,'' said Ryan in the same
interview, ``I wanted to do the role. I received permission to
watch heart surgery so I would be convincing as the woman
surgeon.''
	   According to latest figures, the supernatural romance has
collected over US$16.1 million (RM59.6 million) in ticket sales in
the United States.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed automotive tire producer PT
Goodyear Indonesia is set to boost its exports to offset the
declining demand in the domestic market, an executive says.
	   The company's president, Christopher Wells Clark, said yesterday
that the country's economic crisis had forced the company to switch
its focus to overseas markets.
	   ``We expect the overseas market to contribute more than 50
percent of our sales this year,'' he said, adding that the new
overseas market would include some European countries and the
United States.
	   At present, the company exports its product only to Japan.
	   He, however, declined to disclose the company's sales and profit
projection this year.
	   Clark said the company, which recorded a 50.24 percent decline
in net profit to Rp 5.34 billion in 1997 from Rp 10.73 billion in
1996, expected to see poor earnings this year due to the country's
persistent economic catastrophe.
	   ``With the economic situation expected to worsen in the coming
months, we cannot give any projection,'' he said.

	   SHAH ALAM, Tues. - The Entrepreneur Development Ministry is
concerned over the lack of interest by students who excelled in the
Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia and Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia
examinations in joining technical training institutes.
	   Its Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said with the nation moving
towards becoming an industrialised nation by the year 2020, there
was a demand for skilled labour.
	   ``The majority of the students who excelled in the SPM and STPM
examinations prefer to go to universities rather than to technical
training institutes, thus resulting in poor response to courses
offered by Mara technical training institutes.''
	   He attributed the poor response either to students, especially
Bumiputeras, not wanting to do courses which involved ``dirtying
their hands'' or not satisfied with just obtaining diplomas or
certificates.
	   To encourage more students especially Bumiputeras to take up
courses at Institut Kemahiran Mara, Institut Kemahiran Tinggi Mara,
Pusat Giat Mara and German-Malaysian Institute, Malaysian French
Institute and Tuas Polytechnic, the ministry was in the midst of
holding discussions with the relevant government departments on
upgrading the diploma courses to that of degree.
	   He said there were many who applied to these institutes but only
about 40 per cent were found qualified to pursue the courses.
	   Mustapa was speaking to reporters after presenting ``Sijil
Kemahiran Malaysia Tahap 1'' from National Vocational Training
Council to 93 students who graduated from the Poverty Eradication
Foundation Training Centre (PLYBK).
	   UMW Holdings Berhad sponsored the students' education with a
contribution of RM800,000. This year it is again sponsoring the
education of another 58 students with a contribution of RM700,000.
	   In commending PLYBK for its good work, Mustapa said only
children from the hardcore poor families were selected to pursue
technical training at the centre.
	   PLYBK is open to all Malaysians and the only criterion is that
the students must come from very poor families.
	   Effective from this month, Mustapa said the Selangor Poverty
Eradication Foundation will also provide mechanical, electrical,
computer and science courses to 30 poor Cambodian Muslim youths.
	   The youths, aged between 18 and 22, were identified through its
language centre in Phnom Penh. They will be divided into groups of
five according to their chosen fields and will be trained at PLYBK
in Kuala Selangor or at Pusat Giat Mara.
	   The first batch of 10 students, four girls and six boys, are
scheduled to arrive at the end of this month.
	   UMW Holdings Group chairman Datuk Rahmat Jamari said they were
happy to do their bit to help children from poor families to obtain
skilled training at PLYBK.

Jamaican leader gives plots of land to World Cup team

Eds: REPEATING to remove `WC98' from slug

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ No matter what their fortunes in this
month's World Cup playoffs, Jamaican national soccer team players
all will have plots of land to call home when they return to the
Caribbean.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson presented sales
agreements for parcels of land to each of the team's 22 players
Wednesday during an official send-off.
	   Called the Reggae Boyz, it is the first Jamaican team to win a
berth in the international competition, and the first from an
English-speaking Caribbean nation.
	   ``We have created history and excitement but we are going to
create even more history and excitement by what we achieve by our
performance in France,'' Patterson said. ``There are more miracles
yet to be revealed.''
	   He praised the players, their Brazilian coach Rene Simoes and
the Jamaica Football Federation, which turned the team from a
volunteer squad into a full-time professional team through heavy
marketing and sponsorships.
	   Patterson likened Simoes' dedication to that of Jesus Christ,
despite Simoes' announcement last month that he would leave the
team in October. He made the decision after a national newspaper
reported he was being paid dlrs 18,300 a month, more than any
Jamaican public official.
	   Simoes also has drawn criticism for replacing native-born
Jamaicans with players born in Britain to Jamaican parents.
	   ``Whatever our outcome, you have served us well,'' Patterson
told Simoes. ``We are proud of you and we can say no more than to
pay the highest tribute: to say that we see you as a true and
outstanding (honorary) Jamaican.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Bank Indonesia (BI) announced yesterday that its
net international reserves (NIR) as of May 29 totaled US$14.63
billion, a decline of $61.8 million from the previous week's level.
	   The central bank said in a statement the NIR position was still
higher than the minimum level allowed by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   BI added that its gross foreign assets as of the same date
totaled $19.03 billion, a slight decrease from the previous level
of $19.10 billion.
	   The decline was mainly due to investment in foreign exchange, it
said.
	   BI also said its net domestic assets (NDA) were valued at minus
Rp 34.44 trillion (US$2.94 billion), indicating a monetary
contraction of Rp 1.86 trillion against the previous level.
	   It said the contraction was caused by open market operations,
net claims on the government and increasing net claims on the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) and credit liquidity.
	   The May 29 level was still within the IMF limits, the bank said.
	   An open market operation mainly done through the selling of Bank
Indonesia's short-term promissory notes (SBIs) and rupiah
intervention resulted in a significant contraction of Rp 20.95
trillion compared to the previous week's level, it said.
	   BI added the bank liquidity withdrawal primarily came from the
state-owned banks and foreign and joint-venture banks.
	   The contraction sent the net position of the open market
operation as of May 29 to a negative Rp 64.21 trillion.
	   BI's net claim on the government during the same period
contributed to an expansion of Rp 1.41 trillion, causing a negative
of Rp 36.41 trillion, mainly for the payment of government
employees' salaries, the bank said.
	   BI's net claim on IBRA was Rp 124.63 trillion, an increase of Rp
22.08 trillion compared to the previous week's level.
	   This was mainly related to the increase in liquidity injection
to several banks under IBRA including Bank Central Asia, BI said.
	   It added that the amount of liquidity credit increased by Rp
1.24 trillion, compared to the previous week's level, to reach Rp
19.14 trillion on May 29.
	   The increase was primarily used to support the government's
program to provide essential food items by the State Logistics
Agency (Bulog), BI said.
	   With the above development, reserve money fell by Rp 2.30
trillion, compared to the previous week's level, to Rp 67.96
trillion, the bank said.

	   THE introduction of a corporate management code is vital to
safeguard the credibility of the local bourse, Deputy Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told the Dewan Negara yesterday.
	   The guidelines, which include undertaking restructuring, would
be able to curb the strong speculation element in the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange.
	   He stressed the Government's seriousness in creating viable
corporate governance would help protect the interest of both local
and foreign investors.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Wong See Wah had told the House
last Monday a high-level financial committee on corporate
management had been formed to draw up the best corporate practices
and training programmes for board of directors of companies and
their shareholders.
	   Led by Treasury secretary-general Datuk Dr Aris Othman, the
committee is scheduled to submit a report to Anwar who is also
Finance Minister by the end of this month.
	   Anwar said: ``We are concerned that the current trend of share
trading is closely associated with gambling and speculative
activities, thus failing to portray the actual value of the listed
companies.
	   ``Although the sales and purchase of shares are open to
everyone, we should not treat our stock market like a casino.
	   ``The move (to introduce the management code) is inevitable
because there were instances in the past where public-listed
companies conspired with broker firms in the trading of their
shares.
	   ``This has eroded the confidence of investors,'' he said in
reply to Senator Mastika Junaidah Husin.
	   ``I expect the Securities Commission to continue taking action
or pursuing their investigations on broker firms which are not
ethical in their trading conduct,'' added Anwar.
	   To the original question by Senator Tan Swee Hueng, Anwar said
as of last April, disciplinary action had been taken against 16
KLSE-registered remisiers for non-adherence of its rules and
regulations.
	   ``Among their offences were not working full time with the
member stockbroking firms, getting involved in other businesses,
becoming directors or shareholders of other broking firms, not
being efficient and honest, and abusing their clients' accounts.
	   ``To counter all these, our economy needs an effective corporate
governance with emphasis on good management ethics'' he said.
	   Anwar said the remisiers concerned had been fined between
RM3,000 and RM6,000 each.
	   ``Apart from being fined, they can also have their licences
suspended or revoked from the dealers' list.''
	   There were 7,351 remisiers registered with the KLSE as of May
12.
	   Asked by Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman what action could be
taken against broking firms which misappropriated deposits of their
remisiers, Anwar said: ``The matter has been brought up by the
remisiers' association, and is being probed by the SC and KLSE.
	   ``Our initial investigation revealed that there was carelessness
on the part of the broking firms.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed PT Astra International said
yesterday that it booked a net loss of Rp 2.2 trillion (about
US$200 million) during the first quarter of this year due to its
increasing financial burden.
	   Nevertheless, Astra reported that the value of total
consolidated sales rose 3.9 percent to Rp 3.61 trillion from Rp
3.48 trillion in the first quarter of 1997.
	   Astra spokesman Aminuddin said the company's financial burdens
rose to Rp 2.75 trillion in the first quarter of this year from a
mere Rp 205 billion in the same period of last year.
	   He said the increasing financial burdens resulted from the sharp
depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar, rising domestic
interest rates and increasing swap premiums.
	   The rupiah dropped from 2,419 at the end of March 1997 against
the greenback to 8,325 at the end of March 1998.
	   Because of the sharp drop, the company's foreign debt increased
drastically in rupiah terms, which cost the company more in service
fees.
	   Aminuddin said the increasing sales were mostly contributed by
the agriculture sector, which booked a handsome increase of 46
percent to Rp 127 billion from Rp 87 billion in the first quarter
of 1997.
	   Revenue from the automotive division was boosted by increasing
prices as sales of automobiles and motorcycles dropped
significantly.
	   Astra's auto division, which produces Toyota, Daihatsu, Isuzu,
BMW, Peugeot and Nissan automobiles, sold 15,134 vehicles during
the first three months of this year, down 63.6 percent from 41,602
in the same period of 1997.
	   Sales of motorcycles dropped 49.7 percent to 96,396 vehicles
from 191,626.
	   Aminuddin said the management of Astra International had set
basic strategies for the company and affiliates to withstand the
impact of the crisis this year.
	   The strategies included pursuing healthy cash-flow and debt
management, forging strategic alliances with prospective foreign
partners, raising fresh funds through the initial public offering
of PT Astra Otoparts as well as assessing its investment portfolio
and the possibility of asset sales.
	   Aminuddin said that to ensure a healthy cash-flow, Astra had
instructed subsidiaries to cut all costs, both in production and
operations, improve productivity and efficiency and not to
undertake new investment or expansion, except for PT Astra Agro
Lestari.

	   MALACCA, Tues. - The State Health and Services Department today
issued stop-work orders to two developers, Zubha Sdn Bhd and Suechi
Industries (M) Sdn Bhd, for allowing Aedes larvae to breed in their
construction sites.
	   The order was issued during a spot check by State Committee
chairman of Health and Manpower Development, Datuk Gan Boon Leong,
and department officers.
	   Zubha Sdn Bhd would also be charged in court as it was the
second time it had been caught in this connection.
	   It will be charged under section 23 of the Destruction of
Disease Bearing Insects Act 1975 which carries a fine of up to
RM1,000 or three months' imprisonment or both on conviction.
	   Both companies have two days to clean up their premises.
	   ``Health officers will inspect the sites again on Thursday.''
	   Gan said 217 cases of dengue were reported in the first quarter
of the year with Melaka Tengah district recording 192, followed by
Alor Gajah (18) and Jasin (seven).
	   Of the number, 64 involved secondary and primary school
students.
	   Gan said 225 schools had been inspected. ``Of the number, 25
schools have been found to have bred the larvae. Notices have been
sent to these schools.''
	   Last year, 110 students were down with dengue against nine in
1996.
	   During the visit to the construction sites he was accompanied
among others by his deputy, Chong Tam Onn.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The Education Ministry today issued a
stern warning to undergraduates not to carry out ragging
activities.
	   Its Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said the ministry viewed
cases of excessive orientation acts seriously and would take
disciplinary action against those found to have participated in
them.
	   On a student in Universiti Putra Malaysia who had dropped out
after claiming to be a victim of ragging, Najib said the ministry
would investigate the case after receiving a report from the
university.
	   ``We will take action only after investigations have been
conducted,''
	   Najib told reporters after launching a book Masyarakat Madani:
Satu Tinjauan Awal at Universiti Malaya.
	   Written by several academicians, among them UM lecturers, the
book expounds the meaning of the word ``civil society''.
	   On May 26, 20-year-old R. Prasath from Ipoh, Perak left UPM
after a ragging incident on May 22. Prasath alleged that five
youths, whom he believed to be seniors, had pulled down their pants
and instructed him to perform oral sex.
	   UPM vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dr Syed Jalaluddin Syed
Salim had appealed to the student and his parents to come forward
to assist the university in its investigations.
	   He said Prasath had informed the university authorities of the
alleged incident without leaving any forwarding address.
	   Prasath had also not filed a report.
	   A first-year student in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia had also
claimed to be a victim of ragging.
	   UKM vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dr Anuwar Ali had said that
the university's student affairs department would investigate the
case and take disciplinary action against those responsible.
	   On matriculation courses franchised to private colleges, Najib
said if it was found that the colleges did not meet the standards
set by the National Accreditation Board, they could be ordered to
suspend their courses.
	   Najib said the criteria used in selecting private colleges for
franchise programmes were sufficiency of infrastructure and
adequate finances.
	   He added that one benefit of matriculation courses conducted by
private colleges was the size of classes.
	   ``The size of classes at colleges is small, about 40 students
per class, and this allows lecturers to give more attention to each
student.''
	   Najib also announced that UM would be conducting an elective
subject on civil society for Social Science and Pengajian Islam
students.

At least 100 dead in high-speed German train crash

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's fastest train derailed
Wednesday after the lead locomotive uncoupled from passenger cars,
killing at least 100 people as the cars hurtled into an overpass
and piled one on top of the other.
	   Traveling at a speed of 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour, the
passenger cars crumpled into each other and collapsed the bridge
spanning the tracks. Houses just 50 meters away were unscathed,
protected by an embankment.
	   The cause of Germany's worst train accident since World War II
remained unclear late Wednesday, and officials were unsure how many
people were actually aboard Hamburg-bound ICE 884. Lower-Saxony
state officials said 100 bodies had been recovered and at least 300
people were injured. But rescue coordinators, speaking at a news
conference, reported 40 injured.
	   The accounting of dead and injured was hampered by the severity
of the mangled mess.
	   Rescue workers picked through the wreckage with a crane, and
pried open the metal siding with blow torches. Survivors were found
among the tangle of metal, including a 10-old-girl pulled from the
wreckage an hour and a half after the 11 a.m. crash.
	   All 13 cars and the rear engine derailed, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage, and
residents who described the crash as an explosion reported
survivors wandering away in shock.
	   Passengers knew something was wrong 10 minutes before the
impact, according to one survivor's account.
	   ``There was an uncomfortable rattling and I had the feeling that
maybe something was lying on the tracks. People looked at each
other, shocked, and then it was as if `That's over now,'''
Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, who was seated in the rear of the train,
told German television SAT 1.
	   ``Then it (the noise) started up again and I held on and ducked
down because one had the feeling of being thrown through the air,
and then thank God it came to a standstill.''
	   Schliebener, who was seated in one of three cars thrown to the
side, exited through a door with other passengers.
	   The locomotive driver, oblivious to the catastrophe behind him,
continued driving through the small train station at Eschede, 50
kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover.
	   The station master engaged the emergency brakes, bringing the
engine to a halt two kilometers (more than a mile) from the
overpass.
	   The gravity of the accident brought condolences from leaders
worldwide. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, informed of the tragedy after
arriving in Italy for meetings with Premier Romano Prodi, appeared
shaken by the news and called his visit short.
	   ``So many dead ... It's a tragedy,'' Kohl, his face tight, said
in Bologna with Prodi at his side. ``Excuse me, but I must return
home right away.
	   ``It could be the biggest rail tragedy that ever happened in
Germany. Do you realize what that means? So many dead, hundreds of
injured.''
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety.
The worst previous ICE crash was on Oct. 12, 1991 when a train ran
into six workers repairing tracks who did not hear its approach.
	   A 1967 rail accident near Magdeburg in then-East Germany, killed
94 people when a crossing barrier closed on a rail tanker filled
with gasoline, causing it to explode and spreading fire into
passenger cars.
	   The worst accident in western Germany was in 1971, when a train
carrying children on a field trip collided with a freight train,
killing 46 people.
	   An account of the lead locomotive decoupling, given by chief
regional rescue coordinator Klaus Rathert at a news conference,
conflicted with earlier reports suggesting that an auto had plunged
into the train from the overpass.
	   Police said an automobile was crushed beneath the wreckage, but
it was unclear where the car was parked at the time of the
accident. They said it was probably sitting along the tracks, not
on the overpass.
	   Police spokesman Joachim Lindenberg told ARD television that the
auto belonged to a rail employee who was working along the tracks.
That account was not confirmed by Rathert or Deutsche Bahn
officials.
	   Views of the wreckage offered no clear clues as to what caused
the accident. The nose of the rear engine stuck from under the
bridge, and three derailed cars were piled on each other beneath
the collapsed overpass.
	   Survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the region. The Red
Cross chartered six buses to take most of the uninjured to Hamburg,
spokesman Harald Krueger said.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   Hundreds of people, moved by word of the tragedy, gathered at
Red Cross stations across the country to donate blood.
	   The ICE train connects all major cities at speed up to 280
kilometers (175 miles) an hour, cutting travel time from Munich to
Hamburg - a distance of more than 950 kilometers (about 600 miles)
by more than two hours.
	   The Munich-Hamburg train that crashed Wednesday was a
first-generation ICE model powered by two electric-powered
locomotives, one at front and one at rear, pulling 14 passenger
cars with a capacity of 759 passengers. At top speed the train
requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to come to an emergency stop.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues.- Consumers are still in the dark regarding
the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry's promise to bring
motor workshops and service centres under its jurisdiction.
	   Last year consumers were assured that the ministry would become
the licensing authority for the workshops and centres to protect
the public against unscrupulous operators.
	   SS2 Petaling Jaya residents' association chairman Abu Bakar Mohd
Shariff, speaking on behalf of affected residents, said operators
charged exorbitant prices.
	   ``Not only do they charge high fees for services, but they hike
up prices for spare parts and accessories as well.
	   ``The public have had it with such practices. We need to have
some answers from the ministry soon,'' he said.
	   Last year, Deputy Minister Datuk S. Subramaniam said the
ministry was working towards bringing motor workshops and service
centres under its jurisdiction, thus having more enforcement powers
to take action against errant businessmen.
	   Currently, the motor workshops and service centres are not under
any ministry's jurisdiction.
	   Subramaniam had said that the move was timely as his ministry
had received 133 complaints of exorbitant charges in 1996.

	   WITH Man paying scant regard to the environment, the mega
`Planet Green' project held at Sunway Pyramid in Subang Jaya last
Sunday was indeed timely.
	   The project, jointly organised by the Rotaract Clubs of the Sri
Aman, Assunta and Taman Petaling schools, was carried out under the
guidance of the Rotary Club of Petaling Jaya.
	   Present to launch the one-day event, which drew a huge crowd,
was Rotary Club of Petaling Jaya Youth Service director Kevin Yong.
	   Also present at the launch were international understanding
director of the Rotaract Clubs of the three schools, Loh Yin Peng,
Zalila Haida Lee and Lee Tze Ling respectively.
	   Rotaract Club of Assunta secretary Sarah Khalilah Abdul Rahman
said the annual project was a requirement for every Rotaract Club.
	   ``We have to carry out a major project each year and this year
we decided we would do our bit to get the environmental message
across,'' Sarah said.
	   Sarah said the event was made possible with support from various
groups such as the World Wide Fund For Nature Malaysia, Malaysian
Nature Society, Body Shop, Kolej Damansara Utama Music Club, Nestle
and Panda Pop Lion.
	   The main attraction was an exhibition displaying materials
contributed by MNS and WWF Malaysia. There was also a musical
performance by KDU students, a colouring contest for children and
paper recycling and paper mache demonstrations by pupils.

Survivor recalls ``rattling'' just before train crash 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMS, UPDATES throughout with quotes from survivor, details.
With BC-Germany-Train Derails
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ One survivor said heavy ``rattling''
shocked passengers about 10 minutes before Wednesday's train
derailment in northern Germany.
	   The rattling subsided, then restarted a moment before train cars
jumped the tracks at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour and
jackknifed into the base of an overpass, killing at least 100
people in Germany's deadliest train wreck in three decades.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener, a passenger
from a rear car, told SAT 1 TV.
	   ``Thank God, it came to a standstill,'' Schliebener said. ``Then
I saw in the distance to the front where all the cars were
chaotically laying all over.''
	   Then, he heard the screaming.
	   Several passenger cars had wedged together, some sticking up at
various angles and others buried under the overpass, which had
collapsed. Tallies of the injured ranged from dozens to hundreds.
	   Within an hour the nearby small, red-brick town of Eschede _
about 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Hanover _ was swarming with
fire trucks, rescue workers and volunteers.
	   Helicopters carried the injured to hospitals. Rescue workers
blasted through wrecked cars with blow torches in their search for
bodies and trapped survivors.
	   Officials said the locomotive had decoupled from the high-speed
inter-city train on a straight stretch of track near Eschede. But
it remained unclear what caused the accident.
	   Schliebener said that ``ten minutes before (the crash) there was
an uncomfortable rattling and I had the feeling that maybe
something was lying on the tracks.''
	   ``People looked at each other shocked, and then it was as if:
`That's over now.''' But then the rattling ``started up again.''
	   Hannelore Domkewitz saw the train speed past from her kitchen
window where she stood peeling potatoes. She had just a moment to
reflect that it was moving faster than usual.
	   ``Then there was a loud boom, a dust cloud, and then silence,''
Domkewitz said.
	   The silence didn't last long. There were screams from the
tracks, about 100 yards (300 feet) away. Domkewitz ran toward the
wreck as people with bloodied hands staggered toward her.
	   Domkewitz ran back to get blankets and bed sheets to cover the
injured and dead. ``But there were also survivors who went by with
their luggage. They were all in shock,'' Domkewitz said, her voice
breaking.
	   Mark Draeger heard it too. ``It was like an explosion! Yet very
different, because it was a terrible crushing sound,'' said the
20-year-old aid worker who lived nearby and rushed to the wreckage.
	   Manfred Thiel, who was on his way to work, grabbed a ladder and
helped the injured to safety. He stood by as rescuers pulled a
10-year-old girl from the wreckage alive.
	   Sgt. Phil Forsyth and 20 other British soldiers from the 2nd
Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, based at the nearby German town
of Celle, were among the first to arrive at the scene.
	   Forsyth, speaking in a BBC interview, said: ``On arrival we were
met by an horrific site ... All the carriages were absolutely
mangled; it was a mess and very sad to see.''
	   Forsyth, who was in the British military for 13 years and fought
in the Persian Gulf war, added: ``It is definitely one of the worst
scenes I have ever seen, if not the worst.''

	   THEIR mission is to feed but the people whom the African
Diplomat Women's Group are helping to feed are not ordinary members
of society. They are drug addicts, prostitutes, alcoholics,
abandoned children and the homeless.
	   This was proved during a fund-raising and charity show at the
Royal Commonwealth Club in Damansara last Saturday.
	   These groups of people are usually looked upon with disgust and
hate by the majority of the more fortunate ones.
	   The ADWG wants to change all this and it has started a Street
Evangelism Ministry, which works with the Gospel of Salvation
Mission Society and also J's Corner.
	   J's Corner co-ordinator Roko Rothmund said the ministry
undertakes the feeding programme every Saturday and Sunday.
	   The programme is currently operating in Chow Kit in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   The group plans to spread its wings to other States which are
facing the same problem.
	   Their mission is to provide a ministry to broken and destitute
people, to provide rehabilitation, promote discipline as well as
reconciliation for those who are in need of love and care.
	   ``Many come not only for the food and clothing, but also because
it is one of the rare places where they are treated with love and
care,''
	   Rothmund said.
	   She said in view of the increasing number of destitutes, and the
rising demand for the services provided by the programme, the
mission is seriously contemplating the establishment of a permanent
Home for Destitutes.
	   The ADWG has raised RM2,400 for this purpose and the amount was
presented to Rothmund.
	   At the charity show, the African women paraded their traditional
clothing while their children performed an African dance that
symbolises joy and merriment while guests had the chance to enjoy
African food.
	   Among the participating African countries were Mauritius, South
Africa, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and Fiji Island.
	   Also present were Namibia High Commission counsellor and deputy
head of mission Henry Simon Line and wife Madeline.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - Malaysia will host the Commonwealth Press
Union's biennial conference themed The Eye of the Tiger and the
editors' forum preceding it in October.
	   The conference, expected to be attended by over 150 delegates
from the 53 Commonwealth countries, will be opened by Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Commonwealth
Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku will also address the
conference to be held at the new Mandarin Oriental Hotel.
	   The editors' forum will be held at Universiti Sains Malaysia in
Penang from Oct 21 to 23, and the conference in Kuala Lumpur from
Oct 26 to 29.
	   CPU's executive director Mark Robinson said the decision to hold
the two events at different venues was to enable the editors to see
the attractions of Malaysia.
	   ``The first editors' forum was successfully held in Capetown,
South Africa two years ago and we decided to repeat it in Malaysia
this year,''
	   he said at a Press conference at the National Press Club today.
	   For the conference, the opening day will focus on the problems
and achievements of Southeast Asia including the economic
situation, socio-political issues, the environment and information
superhighway. The rest of the conference will see discussion on
Press freedom and human rights, the Press union's future role, and
the future of news and traditional media.
	   Its Malaysian section chairman Datuk A. Kadir Jasin said
Malaysia was proud to host the conference for the first time.
	   ``It's an important conference as it brings together the media
of countries which have a shared history. The Press union is a
component of the co-operation within the Commonwealth,'' said Kadir
who is also New Straits Times Sdn Bhd group editor.
	   A major sponsor of the conference and forum is Malaysia Airlines
which will provide free passage for 20 delegates from developing
countries and special rates for the others.

	   TEARS welled up in the eyes of Farahida Mohamed Farid. The
project manager of the National Cancer Council (Makna) wiped them
away before she could speak about Mohammad Shafiq Sabaruddin, the
four-year-old cancer patient who died on May 25.
	   It was an emotionally-touching interview with a woman who
organises fund-raising campaigns to establish the Makna Cancer
Institute, the first of its kind in Malaysia, by the year 2000. To
date, about RM25 million has been raised towards the RM100 million
target.
	   ``Shafiq was supposed to be one of the first patients to use the
facilities at our new institute,'' said Farahida.
	   Shafiq's story is a sad one. He never knew his father and his
mother, a prostitute and drug user who abandoned him after birth.
Shafiq was taken in by a drug-addict couple but they neglected him.
	   No one knew this little boy was suffering from neuroblastoma
(cancer of the nerves in his brain which resulted in a tumour).
After his foster parents were arrested, he was cared for by a good
Samaritan who took pity on him.
	   All this while, Shafiq was getting sicker. Then on Aug 3 last
year, he was admitted to hospital and doctors confirmed that he had
a brain tumour.
	   The Welfare Department referred him to the cancer centre, but
his condition deteriorated rapidly. The pressure from the tumour
caused his head to swell and his eyes to bulge and he was
constantly crying and in pain. Despite treatment, Shafiq died last
week.
	   Makna is organising a charity film premiere of City Of Angels at
Smile- UA Cineplex in the new UE3 Plaza (Plaza Uncang Emas 3) in
Cheras on June 14 (four days before its nationwide opening). It is
dedicating the show to the memory of Shafiq.
	   ``We had planned to bring him for the screening,'' said
Farahida. Seats have been allocated for cancer patients,
underprivileged children and invited guests at the premiere.
	   The screening is also dedicated to one of the film's producers,
Dawn Steel, who died of breast cancer last December. The project
was made possible when Warner Bros (M) Sdn Bhd approached the
organisation and offered its assistance after learning of its
fund-raising project. Smile-UA Cineplex Holdings Sdn Bhd and UE3
Plaza were roped in later.
	   Makna, set up on Nov 10, 1994, is a non-governmental and
non-profit organisation with the sole purpose of providing
assistance to cancer sufferers.
	   ``Cancer treatment isn't cheap,'' says Farahida. ``On the
average, a patient will have to spend at least RM20,000 once he or
she has been diagnosed with cancer. With the setting up of the
institute, we hope to help more people, particularly those who
cannot afford the cost of treatment.''
	   The institute will also organise seminars and talks on cancer
prevention, educate the public about early detection, and be
involved in cancer research.
	   The patron of the charity screening is Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah
Wan Ismail, wife of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
She is also Makna patron.

U.S. ambassador: announcement on U.S. peace initiative in days minister in grafs 5-6 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from Netanyahu graf 4, transportation
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The United States expects Israel to
reach a decision on a West Bank troop withdrawal within days, not
weeks, as suggested by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S.
ambassador to Israel said Wednesday.
	   Ambassador Edward Walker said that while the United States has
not given Israel a deadline to accept a U.S. proposal for a troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, ``there is a very
short time frame.''
	   Netanyahu told lawmakers Tuesday that he expected to have made a
decision on an Israeli troop pullback by the end of July, before
parliament goes into summer recess, according to legissday.
	   However, far-right coalition partners have warned Netanyahu that
they would bring down his government over a 13 percent troop
pullback, and Netanyahu is reluctant to accept the U.S. plan. But
Shaul Yaahalom, a member of the right-wing National Religious Party
which holds nine key seats in Netanyahu's 61-120 majority in
parliament, told Israel TV that a coalition collapse could be
avoided.
	   Yaahalom, who serves as transportation minister, said that his
party could vote against the withdrawal in Cabinet but abstain from
a no-confidence vote in parliament, in order to keep Netanyahu in
power while voicing their opposition to the withdrawal.
	   Walker said Wednesday that the United States will soon make a
decision on whether to pursue its peace initiative. If a failure is
announced, Israel would bear the brunt of the blame because the
Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan.
	   ``It (the decision) is in a matter of days rather than weeks,
but precisely what day and what hour and so on I have no idea
exactly. It depends how the progress goes,'' Walker said.
	   Last month, Israel already ignored one U.S. deadline, and
Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Wednesday
that Washington displayed ``a lack of will to stand firm in the
face of Israel's intransigence.''
	   On Tuesday, U.S. envoy Thomas Pickering asked Jordanian and
Saudi Arabian leaders to delay plans for an Arab summit for another
week to allow the American initiative to play itself out.
	   The Palestinians are pushing for an Arab summit that would
conclude with an announcement that the Arab world is suspending the
normalization of ties with Israel as long as Netanyahu does not
carry out the peace agreement already signed.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat traveled to Oman on Wednesday
to lobby for support among Gulf State leaders to convene an Arab
summit. Palestinians have said that they will push for the summit
even if Israel does accept the U.S. proposals.
	   In London, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross met Wednesday with two
top Palestinian officials to discuss the troop withdrawal.
According to the Maariv newspaper, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon declined an
invitation to attend the meeting because the government has not yet
decided on the scope of a troop pullback.

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ A new fund to help the endangered
Siberian tiger is moving to aid fire-fighting efforts at two nature
reserves in eastern Russia, the World Wildlife Fund said Wednesday.
	   An allocation of some dlrs 20,000 is intended to buy and repair
fire-fighting vehicles and other equipment in the Lazovsky and
Sikhote-Alin reserves, home to the most of the surviving 425 to 475
wild Siberian tigers.
	   Unusually dry weather conditions in the area, near the Sea of
Japan, have led to forest fires which ``have already destroyed over
2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of prime tiger land,'' the WWF said in
a statement.
	   Dry weather is set to continue through the summer, with a high
risk of more fires, it added.
	   ``It is better to move now when the situation has not reached
gargantuan proportions than to wait and witness a serious
environmental catastrophe,'' said Jean-Pierre d'Huart, manager of
WWF's International Species Unit.
	   The Tiger Emergency Fund was set up in January by the WWF and
the World Conservation Union.
	   It is intended as a ``rapid-response mechanism'' for dealing
with any events increasing the threats to the tigers' survival.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders pleaded with
Western officials Wednesday for military intervention to halt what
they said is a deliberate Serb strategy of forced expulsions from
Kosovo, as more refugees poured over the border to Albania.
	   The request came with no sign of a letup in the Serbs' offensive
aimed at smashing resistance to their authority in the secessionist
province of southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
10-to-1.
	   According to Albanian sources, Serb forces shelled at least five
villages Wednesday in an area of western Kosovo near the Albanian
border, sending more residents fleeing. Houses were set ablaze in
the attack by Serb police and paramilitary units, backed by
Yugoslav army tanks.
	   New casualty reports from the sealed-off area were not
available. Dozens are believed dead since the start of a stepped-up
campaign last week by the Serbs, who want to wipe out the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. At least 80 people were
killed in a similar crackdown in March, and well over 200 people
have died this year in clashes.
	   Meanwhile, Adem Demaci, an influential ethnic Albanian
politician, told reporters in Pristina that the Albanians' leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, has no influence over the Kosovo Liberation Army
which ``does not want to hear of him.''
	   He said that, compared to a month ago when the KLA controlled
some 200 square kilometers of Kosovo, they now control ``3,000
square kilometers, with about 250 villages with a population
between 700,000 and 800,000.'' His information could not be
independently confirmed.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross
requested the Serbian authorities to ``immediate and unimpeded
access'' to the area of the fighting in order to carry out
humanitarian work there. The group said its delegates had been
prevented from entering the Decani area in the last two weeks
despite prior assurances they could.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military regime broke its
silence Wednesday on a planned visit by a senior U.S. State
Department delegation, saying the West African country welcomed the
chance to strengthen ties.
	   Plans for the State Department visit, headed by former U.S.
ambassador to Nigeria Thomas Pickering, were announced last week as
part of Washington's effort to urge dictator Gen. Sani Abacha to
embrace genuine democratic reform.
	   If the visit goes ahead, Nigeria may respond by sending its own
delegation to Washington, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told
reporters.
	   ``Nigeria would like to have good relations with all countries.
We are indeed a very friendly country,'' Ikimi said. ``It is the
United States which avoided visits in the past. If President
Clinton sends an envoy to Nigeria, our own head of state will also
send an envoy to the United States.''
	   Several human rights groups in Nigeria voiced opposition to the
proposed U.S. visit, saying it would only give credibility to
Abacha's rule.
	   ``Frankly I do not see how any good come out of this visit. The
position of both sides are simply too far apart,'' said Clement
Nwankwo, executive director of the pro-democracy group
Constitutional Rights Project.
	   Abacha seized power in a bloodless 1993 coup that was widely
condemned in the international community.
	   Although the military has pledged to hand over power to an
elected government later this year, Abacha in April became the only
candidate for president in a nomination process that critics say
was rigged and manipulated.
	   Washington has described Nigeria's political transition process
as ``flawed and failing.''
	   ``We do not see how the current process will lead to a
democratically elected civilian government,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said last week.
	   The decision to send Pickering to Nigeria could be aimed at
clarifying American policy on Africa's most populous country.
	   The Lagos-based Daily Times reported earlier this week Abacha
would not meet with the U.S. officials, but the newspaper cited no
sources nor evidence to support the report.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami, who has sought a
more moderate course for Iran since his election a year ago, plans
to go to the United States to address the U.N. General Assembly in
September, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Referring to the planned address as a ``very important speech,''
the official said Khatami would discuss the position of Muslims in
the world and in the United Nations.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Khatami would urge the United Nations to give Islamic nations a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
	   The statement was the first announcement of the planned trip,
though such a visit had been rumored for days. The trip would
require U.S. government permission, but this is never refused to a
head of state.
	   Breaking through nearly 20 years of hostility, Khatami called
for a dialogue with Americans and more cultural and educational
exchanges in a broadcast interview last January.
	   Two previous Iranian presidents have addressed the United
Nations since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but both used their
speeches to attack the United States. Khatami could instead make a
gesture to American leaders.
	   Khatami will also use his trip to meet the 2 million strong
Iranian community in the United States, the official said. Many
Iranians fled their country to settle in the United States and
other Western countries after the revolution.
	   The United States severed ties with Iran after militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.

	   RIJEKA, Croatia (AP) _ A spectacular free kick by Robert
Prosinecki and a close-range goal by Davor Suker lifted Croatia to
a 2-0 victory over Iran Wednesday in a World Cup warmup match.
	   Croatia held the visitors in their own half through most of the
game and dictated the tempo of play with short and safe passes.
	   Iran, whose midfield crumbled early, battled stubbornly in
defense, winning mid-air duels but often having to resort to fouls
to fend off Croat attacks.
	   A foul on Zvonimir Boban, the home side's captain, from a few
meters (yards) outside the penalty area, proved particularly costly
for the Iranians. Prosinecki converted from the dead ball situation
in the 30th minute, lifting his shot over the wall and into the top
corner of the net.
	   Although mostly on their back feet, the Iranians were not,
however, without their chances. They searched for an equalizer
through quick breaks and long flanks to their front men.
	   Khodadad Azizi missed Iran's best opportunity when he fired a
56th minute penalty wide of the goal. A cracking volley by Mehdi
Mahdavikia and a sailing drive over the crossbar that only just
missed the target were some of Iran's other promising chances to
pull one back.
	   Suker put the game beyond doubt in the 77th minute when he
latched onto a loose ball in the box and sent it past a helpless
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh.
	   The match completed Iran's cycle of warm-up games before they
join Group F in France with triple-champions Germany, Yugoslavia
and the United States.
	   Croatia joins Group H in their first-ever World Cup with
two-time titlists Argentina and fellow rookies Japan and Jamaica.
	   Before leaving for France, Croatia will also play a tuneup match
with Australia at home on Saturday.
	   Lineups:
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic (Marijan Mrmic, 46th), Zvonimir Soldo,
Igor Stimac (Igor Tudor, 46th), Dario Simic, Robert Jarni (Ante
Seric, 85th), Zvonimir Boban (Krunoslav Jurcic, 46th), Aljosa
Asanovic (Silvio Maric, 65th), Robert Prosinecki (Zoran Mamic,
80th), Mario Stanic (Goran Juric, 82nd), Davor Suker, Goran
Vlaovic.
	   Iran _ Nima Nakisa (Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, 56th), Javad Zarincheh
(Na'eem Saadavi, 75th) Nader Mohammadkhani (Sirous Din-Mohammadi,
83rd), Mehdi Pashazadeh, Mohammad Khakpour, Karim Bagheri, Mehdi
Mahdavikia Reza Shahroudi (Mehrdad Minavand, 81st), Khodadad Azizi,
Ali Daei, Hamid Reza Estili (Alireza Mansourian, 56th).

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders pleaded with
Western officials Wednesday for military intervention to halt what
they said is a deliberate Serb strategy of forced expulsions from
Kosovo, as more refugees poured over the border to Albania.
	   The request came with no sign of a letup in the Serbs' offensive
aimed at smashing resistance to their authority in the secessionist
province of southern Serbia, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
10-to-1.
	   According to Albanian sources, Serb forces shelled at least five
villages Wednesday in an area of western Kosovo near the Albanian
border, sending more residents fleeing. Houses were set ablaze in
the attack by Serb police and paramilitary units, backed by
Yugoslav army tanks.

Ibrahim Rugova, has no influence over the Kosovo Liberation Army
which ``does not want to hear of him.''

requested the Serbian authorities to ``immediate and unimpeded
access'' to the area of the fighting in order to carry out
humanitarian work there. The group said its delegates had been
prevented from entering the Decani area in the last two weeks
despite prior assurances they could.
	   Top aides to Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Albanians'
self-described independent government, met with a European
delegation in Kosovo's capital Pristina on Wednesday. They told the
officials that ``ethnic cleansing and massacres carried out by Serb
forces in western Kosovo are a part of a planned-out scheme of
ethnic cleansing throughout the province.''
	   The situation is dramatic and NATO must intervene, they told the
delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, headed by Javier Ruperez. They said world powers also must
pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is determined
to keep Kosovo from breaking away from Serbia, one of two remaining
republics in Yugoslavia.
	   ``Unless there is significant international pressure on
Belgrade, chances for a peaceful solution to the crisis will be
lost forever,'' Alush Gashi said.
	   But NATO allies, with 34,000 troops already in neighboring
Bosnia, are reluctant to commit another big contingent to the
Balkans.
	   Meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, they agreed to consider again
whether to deploy combat troops to Albania and Macedonia on
Kosovo's borders, but indicated a decision is not imminent.
	   Ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations did agree to accelerate other
measures, including technical and military assistance for Albania
and Macedonia.
	   Besides thousands of displaced Kosovo residents who have sought
shelter in border highlands, several thousand others have streamed
over the border into Albania.
	   OSCE spokesman Bill Foxton confirmed at the Albanian border that
at least two refugees had died as a result of the arduous trek over
the mountains _ a 60-year-old man of a heart attack and a
4-year-old girl who died when her mother, who was carrying her,
slipped and fell on a rocky path.
	   International monitors near the border said houses could be seen
in flames in the besieged village of Junik. The pro-Albanian Kosovo
Information Center said the fighting was spreading east of
Djakovica, one of the hotspots of the last several days.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ As a State Department official said the
U.S. had canceled a high-level mission to Nigeria, the military
regime in this West African country welcomed possible future visits
by U.S. officials as a chance to strengthen ties.
	   Plans for the State Department visit, to be headed by former
U.S. ambassador to Nigeria Thomas Pickering, were canceled on
Wednesday after Nigeria demanded that restrictions be lifted on
travel by Nigerian officials to the United States, a State
Department official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The proposed visit had been announced last week as part of
Washington's effort to urge dictator Gen. Sani Abacha to embrace
genuine democratic reform.
	   The State Department official said Washington decided that
Nigeria's conditions were unacceptable as the travel restrictions
formed part of a range of penalties against Abacha's seizure of
power in a bloodless military coup five years ago.
	   Meanwhile, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi broke his
government's silence on the proposed visit by publicly offering to
send a Nigerian delegation to Washington. He did not speak of a
cancelation or say whether the military regime had demanded a
Nigerian visit to the U.S. as a pre-condition for Pickering's
mission.
	   ``Nigeria would like to have good relations with all countries.
We are indeed a very friendly country,'' Ikimi said. ``It is the
United States which avoided visits in the past. If President
Clinton sends an envoy to Nigeria, our own head of state will also

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Kerry Wood was his usual solid self, and Sammy
Sosa hit a two-run homer run Wednesday as the Chicago Cubs beat the
Florida Marlins 5-1.
	   While Livan Hernandez (3-4) was getting rocked for 10 hits and
five runs in seven innings, Wood (6-2) was rolling. He struck out
nine batters and gave up five hits in eight innings as he won his
fifth straight decision.
	   The Cubs (34-24) moved 10 games over .500 for the first time
since finishing the 1989 season at 93-69 _ the last time Chicago
made the postseason.
	   Wood struck out his first batter and didn't give up a hit until
Craig Counsell's double in the third inning. And he got better as
the game went along. With the fans in the bleachers pasting neon
orange-and-yellow K signs on a center field railing, Wood struck
out at least one batter from the fourth inning on.

Opposition parties seek to end 14-year government in St. Vincent 
</HEADLINE>
By DUGGIE JOSEPH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Opposition parties are hoping to
seize on a 45 percent unemployment rate to unseat Prime Minister
Sir James Mitchell in June 15 parliamentary elections.
	   Mitchell, who has governed St. Vincent and the Grenadines since
being elected in 1984, says he'll leave politics if his New
Democratic Party loses.
	   ``The people are ready for change, and we are prepared to
deliver it,'' said Ralph Gonsalves, deputy leader of the opposition
Unity Labor Party.
	   Unity Labor and the People's Working Party point to endemic
unemployment and the shaky state of the banana industry as reasons
for change.
	   The World Trade Organization ruled last year that European Union
incentives for Caribbean banana exports constituted unfair trade.
St. Vincent and other eastern Caribbean countries depend
extensively on bananas, as well as tourism, for foreign income.
	   Mitchell says he has brought many improvements to St. Vincent,
including construction of roads and water systems, a Kingstown
vegetable market and a new 300-room hotel. He says the works will
attract new business and lessen the country's reliance on
agriculture.
	   ``Today we are strong, with international influence beyond our
size,'' said Mitchell, who was knighted by Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II in 1995.

night.
	   In a match played at Santander's Sardinero Stadium, FC
Barcelona's Juan Antonio Pizzi scored the first goal for Spain in
the 29th minute when he took a long pass deep inside Northern
Ireland's area and outdribbled goalie Aaron Hughes.
	   Encouraged by the victory, the Spaniards looked dangerous and in
the 37th made it 2-0 with Pizzi scoring from the right side with a
strong header.
	   With the first half nearing the end, the Irish got their first
goal when Jerry Taggart s headed after an error by Spanish defense.
	   But the Spaniards looked stronger going in the second half and
twenty-two-year-old forward Fernando Morientes, who replaced Pizzi
at half-time, when finding himself unmarked at 10 yards (meters),
fired the ball past the Irish goalie in the 47th.
	   Again national team newcomer Morientes sent the ball in and
settled the game in minute 67.
	   About 12,000 fans watched the friendly.
	   Spain lost its first friendly against World cup host France 1-0
in January and easily won Sweden 4-0 in its second warmup game in
March.
	   The side is grouped with Bulgaria, Nigeria and Paraguay in the
World Cup which starts June 10.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain: Santiago Canizares, Albert Ferrer, Abelardo Fernandez,
Ivan Campo, Sergi Barjuan ( Agustin Aranzabal, 46), Joseba
Etxeberria, Guillermo Amor, Albert Celades, Julen Guerrero
(Francisco Narvaez `Kiko', 46), Juan Antonio Pizzi (Fernando
Morientes, 46) Raul Gonzalez (Alfonso, 46)
	   Northern Ireland: Aaron Hughes, Jim Whitley, Jim Magilton
(Mulryne, 76), Neil Lennon (Jeff Whitley, 90), Jon McCarthy,
Michael Hughes, Jenkins, Steve Morrow (Patterson, 65), Terry
Taggart, Fettis, Iain Dowie.

North Koreans agree to first tentative steps toward market economy 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In a move that could have far-reaching
effects, North Korea has agreed to a plan to decentralize some of
its agricultural sector and allow small farmers to sell a portion
of their crops wherever they can find the best price.
	   ``They are going into what they call `modernization' but it
cannot happen overnight. There are so many implications for the
society,'' Christian Lemaire, the UNDP representative based in
North Korea, told The Associated Press.
	   North Korea and the U.N. Development Program developed the plan
to gradually restore food production to pre-1995 levels and end
North Korean reliance on emergency humanitarian aid _ estimated at
dlrs 2 billion over three years. The government is asking for dlrs
300 million to implement the plan.
	   North Korea's willingness to change their highly-centralized,
regimented agricultural system represents an acknowledgment by
government officials that state bureaucracy contributed to their
critical food shortage, created by a series of severe floods and
droughts, other U.N. officials said.
	   But Lemaire said the North Koreans were reluctant to take steps
which might endanger the system of social controls and benefits
which has been the hallmark of its communist system.
	   The plan, formally presented last week at a two-day conference
in Geneva, allows greater autonomy in decision-making for rural
agricultural cooperatives, allows cooperatives to develop trade
among themselves, creates a system of small-scale credits and
permits private households to develop small-scale commerce.
	   ``So they have private plots and they sell the produce to
whichever gives the best price _ the cooperative or these farmers'
markets,'' Lemaire said. ``Once you start injecting money at that
level, it can only go one way.''
	   Lemaire said the degree of cooperation between North Korean and
U.N. officials had improved dramatically over the last two years as
more international attention, generated by the food crisis, has
been directed at the North.
	   ``People are also much more open, people go to the markets, it's
a tremendous change,'' he said.
	   But he said international agencies are still denied regular
access to about 20 percent of the country _ mainly military zones
along the borders with South Korea and China.

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Hurtling with a momentum that piled
train cars one atop another in twisted heaps of steel, Germany's
fastest passenger train derailed and jackknifed Wednesday when the
lead locomotive broke loose. State officials said at least 100
people were killed.
	   Traveling at a speed of 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour, car
after car slammed into an overpass, bringing the bridge crashing
down upon the wreckage and the dead and wounded. Houses just 50
yards (150 feet) 150 feet away were unscathed, protected by an
embankment.
	   The cause of Germany's worst train accident since World War II
remained unclear late Wednesday, and officials were unsure how many
people were aboard Hamburg-bound ICE 884. Lower-Saxony state
officials said at least 100 people were killed and at least 300
people injured.
	   But rescue coordinators, speaking at a news conference, reported
40 injured. Police at the scene said 90 people had been hurt.
	   Police spokesman Joachim Lindenberg said 73 bodies were
recovered and three more located. He said more bodies ``will
certainly'' be found in two coaches still buried beneath the
collapsed overpass.
	   The accounting of dead and injured was hampered by the severity
of the mangled mess.
	   Rescue workers picked through the wreckage with a crane, and
sliced open the metal siding with blow torches. Survivors were
found among the tangle of metal, including a 10-old-girl pulled
from the wreckage an hour and a half after the 11 a.m. crash.
	   But as rescue efforts continued into the night, officials said
the chance of finding new survivors was slight.
	   All 13 cars and the rear engine derailed, and splintered glass
covered the scene. Luggage was piled next to the wreckage, and
residents who described the crash as an explosion reported
survivors wandering away in shock.

Croatia downs Iran 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: repeating to some points
<TEXT>
	   RIJEKA, Croatia (AP) _ A spectacular free kick by Robert
Prosinecki and a close-range goal by Davor Suker lifted Croatia to
a 2-0 victory over Iran Wednesday in a World Cup warmup match.
	   Croatia held the visitors in their own half through most of the
game and dictated the tempo of play with short and safe passes.
	   Iran, whose midfield crumbled early, battled stubbornly in
defense, winning mid-air duels but often having to resort to fouls
to fend off Croat attacks.
	   A foul on Zvonimir Boban, the home side's captain, from a few
meters (yards) outside the penalty area, proved particularly costly
for the Iranians. Prosinecki converted from the dead ball situation
in the 30th minute, lifting his shot over the wall and into the top
corner of the net.
	   Although mostly on their back feet, the Iranians were not,
however, without their chances. They searched for an equalizer
through quick breaks and long flanks to their front men.
	   Khodadad Azizi missed Iran's best opportunity when he fired a
56th minute penalty wide of the goal. A cracking volley by Mehdi
Mahdavikia and a sailing drive over the crossbar that only just
missed the target were some of Iran's other promising chances to
pull one back.
	   Suker put the game beyond doubt in the 77th minute when he
latched onto a loose ball in the box and sent it past a helpless
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh.
	   The match completed Iran's cycle of warm-up games before they
join Group F in France with triple-champions Germany, Yugoslavia
and the United States.
	   Croatia joins Group H in their first-ever World Cup with
two-time titlists Argentina and fellow rookies Japan and Jamaica.
	   Before leaving for France, Croatia will also play a tuneup match
with Australia at home on Saturday.
	   Lineups:
	   Croatia _ Drazen Ladic (Marijan Mrmic, 46th), Zvonimir Soldo,
Igor Stimac (Igor Tudor, 46th), Dario Simic, Robert Jarni (Ante
Seric, 85th), Zvonimir Boban (Krunoslav Jurcic, 46th), Aljosa
Asanovic (Silvio Maric, 65th), Robert Prosinecki (Zoran Mamic,
80th), Mario Stanic (Goran Juric, 82nd), Davor Suker, Goran
Vlaovic.
	   Iran _ Nima Nakisa (Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, 56th), Javad Zarincheh
(Na'eem Saadavi, 75th) Nader Mohammadkhani (Sirous Din-Mohammadi,
83rd), Mehdi Pashazadeh, Mohammad Khakpour, Karim Bagheri, Mehdi
Mahdavikia Reza Shahroudi (Mehrdad Minavand, 81st), Khodadad Azizi,
Ali Daei, Hamid Reza Estili (Alireza Mansourian, 56th).

Butler to lay out ``road map'' for Iraq to follow to end of sanctions meeting resumes Thursday at 1430 GMT 
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Dealing what the U.S. ambassador called a
``devastating blow'' to Iraq's credibility, the chief U.N.
inspector used photos, charts and records Wednesday to press his
claim that Baghdad is still hiding illegal weapons.
	   Richard Butler presented his evidence before the Security
Council in an effort to convince the 15 members that Iraq has still
failed to comply with U.N. orders to destroy all long-range
missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   Butler's presentation lasted throughout the day Wednesday and
was to resume behind closed-doors Thursday at 10:30 a.m. (1430
gmt).
	   U.N. arms inspectors must certify Iraq free of illegal weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed in August 1990 after
President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf
conflict.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed illegal materials, and Russia,
France, China and others have been pressuring the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, which Butler heads, to back up his claims to
the contrary.
	   ``UNSCOM has dealt a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility,''
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said after the morning session.
``UNSCOM has produced documents, charts that catalogue the gaps and
inconsistencies in Iraqi claims in the chemical, biological and
other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
by Iraq and that Baghdad still has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions. ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to
do,'' he said.
	   British Ambassador John Weston said it was clear ``there are a
number of unanswered questions'' even in the field of missiles, one
of the areas where the United Nations said progress in disarmament
had been made.

Mexican police, army raid rebel-supporting town; arrest 141

<TEXT>
	   NICOLAS RUIZ, Mexico (AP) _ One thousand police officers and
soldiers swarmed into this small southern Mexican town early
Wednesday, firing tear gas, breaking down doors and arresting 141
rebel sympathizers they said had ``held the town hostage.''
	   People scattered through the streets and hundreds fought police
with poles during a raid that Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen insisted
was intended only to ``bring the town into conformity with the
law.''
	   ``We don't care if they're sympathizers of the Zapatista
National Liberation Army or if they're Muslims. All we care about
is that they respect the law,'' he said in a telephone interview
from the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   The governor said the raid was peaceful, but television images
showed state police kicking people and beating them with wooden
poles. One image showed the face of a villager covered in blood.
Authorities said no one was injured, but townsfolk said dozens of
people were hurt, most of them by tear gas.
	   Some of the officers carried assault rifles, and they broke down
doors to drag suspects from their beds in the early morning raid.
Helicopters flew overhead.
	   The raid was similar to two others carried out in the last two
months in the villages of Taniperlas and Agua Tinta, both
sympathetic to the Zapatistas.
	   Twelve foreigners were arrested and deported during the
Taniperlas raid, and a group of Italians who denounced alleged
human rights abuses during the raid were later deported for
visiting the village without permission.
	   Albores Guillen denied that Nicolas Ruiz supported the rebels,
blaming a ``small minority'' of the town's residents for
intimidating the rest of the town of 8,000 people, 60 miles (100
kilometers) east of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   He said that group didn't allow others to choose their political
parties, denied them religious freedom, made unilateral decisions
and wouldn't allow the government into the town to build a road and
a health clinic.
	   He said they also ``very violently'' expelled 33 families from
the town who ``didn't agree with their ideas.''
	   Most of the people arrested were supporters of the leftist
opposition Democratic Revolution Party. Albores Guillen said the
raid came only after they refused to negotiate.
	   ``Hopefully we won't have to conduct any more raids, as long as
these groups understand that we're in a new Chiapas,'' he said.
	   The governor was appointed in January after his predecessor was
forced to resign over alleged government complicity in the massacre
of 45 men, women and children in another village that sympathized
with the rebels.
	   Like his predecessor and all other governors in Chiapas'
history, Albores Guillen is a member of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   The rebels staged a brief uprising in 1994, demanding greater
rights for Mexico's poor Indians. Peace talks stalled after the
government backed off of a treaty the two sides had signed on
greater Indian autonomy.

Romario returns to Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Greeted by a large crowd of
cheering fans and friends, striker Romario returned to Brazil on
Wednesday after being dropped from the Brazilian World Cup squad
because of an injured right calf.
	   ``I went to France full of happiness and surrounded by
friends,'' Romario said shortly after arriving at Rio de Janeiro's
international airport. ``I return alone and full of sadness.''
	   ``My dream of helping Brazil win its fifth world cup was
shattered, he added.
	   ``There was a lack of patience. I know how my body functions and
I know I would have the physical conditions to play.''
	   Romario said he plans to be fully recovered in 15 days when he
expects to resume playing for Rio's Flamengo.
	   Some of the fans cried when they saw Romario. Others shouted
invectives against Zico, the team's coordinator whom they said was
responsible for Romario's exclusion from the squad.
	   But Romario refused to blame Zico, saying the decision to drop
him from the team was taken jointly by the team's technical
commission.
	   A poll conducted by the O Globo newspaper showed that 50 percent
of Rio de Janeiro's residents agrees that Romario should have been
dropped from the team. Another 45.5 percent said he should have
remained.
	   The poll also showed that 50.1 percent of those interviewed
believed that without Romario the national squad has less chances
of winning the World Cup.
	   A total of 407 people were interviewed in eight different
regions of the city. No margin of error was given.
	   O Globo's sports commentator Renato Mauricio Prado said the
decision to drop Romario was a hasty one.
	   ``I would have given him more time to recover so that he could
at least play in the second round - the moment of truth when his
absence will be most felt.''

World leaders send condolences to Germany after train accident 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Condolence letters from world leaders
poured into Germany in the wake of Wednesday's train accident that
left at least 100 people dead.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl broke short an official visit to Italy.
	   ``So many dead. It's a tragedy. Excuse me, but I must return
home right away,'' a rigid-faced Kohl said after dining with
Premier Romano Prodi.
	   Prodi told Kohl that Italy felt close to Germany in its moment
of grief.
	   The high-speed, Hamburg-bound train derailed Wednesday, hurtling
into an overpass, with passenger cars crumpling together like an
accordion. Officials were unsure how many people were on board.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also offered his
condolences to Kohl.
	   ``In the name of the state of Israel and myself I wish to
express to you and the German people my deep heartfelt sorrows for
the loss of life in this tragic accident,'' Netanyahu wrote in a
telegram. ``We sympathize with the the bereaved and mourning.''
	   Japanese Emperor Akihito, on a three-day visit to Denmark,
expressed his ``deepest sympathy to Germany,'' spokesman Kazuo
Chiba said.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques
Chirac also sent condolences. Chirac said his deepest sympathies
were with the families of the victims.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Kerry Wood was his usual solid self, and Sammy
Sosa hit a two-run homer run Wednesday as the Chicago Cubs beat the
Florida Marlins 5-1.
	   While Livan Hernandez (3-4) was getting rocked for 10 hits and
five runs in seven innings, Wood (6-2) was rolling. He struck out
nine batters and gave up five hits in eight innings as he won his
fifth straight decision.
	   The Cubs (34-24) moved 10 games over .500 for the first time
since finishing the 1989 season at 93-69 _ the last time Chicago
made the postseason.
	   Scott Servais hit a two-run double in the fourth to put the Cubs
up 2-1 and Sosa hit his 16th home run of the year, and seventh in
six games, to make it 4-1 in the fifth.
  Giants 8, Reds 5  
	   In San Francisco, Brian Johnson hit two home runs for the second
time in four days as San Francisco won its sixth straight win.
	   Shawn Estes (5-5) won his third straight decision, carrying a
four-hit shutout into the seventh before the Reds touched him for
five runs.
	   Johnson, who also hit two home runs against Arizona on Sunday,
had three hits and is 14-for-38 with seven home runs and 13 RBIs
since coming off the disabled list May 20.
	   Johnson homered against Brett Tomko (5-4) to lead off the third
and added a two-run shot off reliever Scott Sullivan in the fifth.
	   Robb Nen got his 16th save in 17 chances.

Philippine Airlines, American Airlines Code-Sharing Approved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Wednesday
the U.S. Department of Transportation has approved its code-sharing
agreement with American Airlines.
	   The approval paves the way for the launching of joint services
by the two airlines as early as August, an arrangement that would
likely result in cost savings for both, PAL said.
	   PAL said the two airlines will jointly operate scheduled
services between Manila and five major U.S. points _ Chicago,
Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, New York and Washington D.C. _ via either
Los Angeles or San Francisco.
	   PAL will fly passengers on the Manila-Los Angeles and the
Manila-San Francisco legs, while American Airlines will operate
flights to the five U.S. points from Los Angeles and San Francisco.
	   It would mean seamless travel between Manila and the five U.S.
points for transpacific passengers, PAL said.
	   The two airlines are working out the operational aspects of the
code-sharing agreement, particularly those dealing on the
automation enhancements necessary to ensure the transition of
passengers between the carriers' respective services, PAL said.
	   Financial details of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Spain drubs Northern Ireland 4-1 in World Cup warmup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SANTANDER, Spain (AP) _ Spain demolished Northern Ireland 4-1 in
warm-up match Wednesday that showed its readiness for the World
Cup.
	   In a match played at Santander's Sardinero Stadium, FC
Barcelona's Juan Antonio Pizzi scored the first goal for Spain in
the 29th minute when he took a long pass deep inside Northern
Ireland's area and outdribbled goalie Aaron Hughes.
	   Encouraged by the victory, the Spaniards looked dangerous and in
the 37th made it 2-0 with Pizzi scoring from the right side with a
strong header.
	   With the first half nearing the end, the Irish got their first
goal when Jerry Taggart s headed after an error by Spanish defense.
	   But the Spaniards looked stronger going in the second half and
22-year-old forward Fernando Morientes, who replaced Pizzi at
half-time, when finding himself unmarked at 10 yards (meters),
fired the ball past the Irish goalie in the 47th.
	   Again national team newcomer Morientes sent the ball in and
settled the game in minute 67.
	   About 12,000 fans watched the friendly.
	   Spain lost its first friendly against World cup host France 1-0
in January and easily won Sweden 4-0 in its second warmup game in
March.
	   The side is grouped with Bulgaria, Nigeria and Paraguay in the
World Cup which starts June 10.
	   Lineups:
	   Spain: Santiago Canizares, Albert Ferrer, Abelardo Fernandez,
Ivan Campo, Sergi Barjuan ( Agustin Aranzabal, 46), Joseba
Etxeberria, Guillermo Amor, Albert Celades, Julen Guerrero
(Francisco Narvaez `Kiko', 46), Juan Antonio Pizzi (Fernando
Morientes, 46) Raul Gonzalez (Alfonso, 46)
	   Northern Ireland: Aaron Hughes, Jim Whitley, Jim Magilton
(Mulryne, 76), Neil Lennon (Jeff Whitley, 90), Jon McCarthy,
Michael Hughes, Jenkins, Steve Morrow (Patterson, 65), Terry
Taggart, Fettis, Iain Dowie.

Sorenstam happy to be headed for St. Louis 
</HEADLINE>
By ED SCHAFER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam, defending champion at the
dlrs 600,000 Michelob Light Classic, is happy to be headed back to
this year's tournament.
	   She likes the people, she likes the golf course. But mostly,
she's happy to return because she needs a win, and she's won the
St. Louis event twice before.
	   Droughts are uncommon for Sorenstam, 28, who won six tournaments
in 1997, when she was the LPGA's leading money winner with earnings
of dlrs 1.2 million.
	   This year has been harder, as Sorenstam has yet to post a win
and stands fourth on the earnings list at dlrs 288,400. But
Sorenstam is not frustrated, because she knows it's the increased
competition that's kept her from winning.
	   ``My scoring average is going down and I'm still not winning,''
she said. ``I think there will be a lot of new winners this year.''
	   Two young women who will be trying to join that category are
this year's sponsor's exemptions, NCAA Player of the Year Marisa
Baena of the University of Arizona and Cindy Mueller of Belleville,
Illinois. Mueller, a golf instructor, made the cut here last year.
	   Among the 144 players in this year's field trying to keep the
youngsters down, however, are seven of the top 10 money winners on
the tour _ Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, Donna Andrews, Pat Hurst, Lorie
Kane, Danielle Ammaccapane and Meg Mallon.
	   But Sorenstam has a comfort factor at Forest Hills that none of
the other players can match. She has won two of the three times she
has played here, in 1995 and last year. She said just being here
gives her a boost.
	   ``I know I can play this course,'' she said. ``It gives me a lot
of confidence. I know every hole. I can play it in my sleep.''
	   The par 72 layout fits her game, Sorenstam believes. The
fairways are tight, often lined with large trees. She is annually
among the LPGA leaders in hitting fairways and greens.
	   ``It's a course where you have to think a lot,'' she said. ``A
lot of players run out of patience. I have a lot (of patience) and
I think that's why I play so well here.''
	   Despite her struggles, Sorenstam hasn't made any changes in her
swing. And she doesn't believe in even trying to make changes while
she is playing.
	   ``If I hit a fade in practice,'' she said, ``then I play to my
fade that day. There's nothing wrong with a fade.''

Marijuana not banned substance for Commonwealth Games tests 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Athletes competing at this
year's Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur will not be stripped of
their medals if they test positive for marijuana.
	   ``We are not interested in marijuana because it isn't a
restricted drug in any of the Commonwealth sports, so we don't take
any notice of it,'' Dr. Geoffrey Haigh, honorary medical advisor
for the Commonwealth Games Federation, said Wedneday. ``It's not an
issue.''
	   Marijuana testing and concerns over pollution in the Malaysian
capital were two topics discussed during a Commonwealth Games
Federation meeting Haigh attended last week in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Asked if an athlete testing positive for marijuana would be
stripped of their medal, Haight said: ``No. Never was.''
	   Marijuana became an issue at this year's Winter Olympic Games
when traces of pot were found in Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati's urine sample.
	   The International Olympic Committee stripped the Whistler,
British Columbia, resident of the gold medal he won in the men's
giant slalom even though Rebagliati claimed he was a victim of
second-hand smoke.
	   The IOC's decision was later overturned and the medal reinstated
by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled there was no
clear provision for marijuana testing at the Olympic Games.
	   Embarrassed by the fiasco, the IOC's executive board agreed in
April to draft new provisions in the Olympic Charter and the IOC
medical code. IOC officials said marijuana would be added to the
banned list and any athletes testing positive for the drug would be
disqualified.
	   Haigh said the Commonweath Games Federation follows the IOC
rules, but to date marijuana has not officially been named a banned
substance.
	   ``Since it is not at present listed as a banned substance, we
are following last year's list, if you like,'' he said.

Mandatory arbitration for Norwegian nurses' aides 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ 20,000 striking Norwegian nurses' aides were
ordered back to work Wednesday by the government.
	   Minister of local government, Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad, imposed
mandatory arbitration after a week's strike, arguing that the
strike, which had gradually been expanded, threatened patients'
lives.
	   About 5,000 members of the Academics' Union, including some
teachers, a few nurses and civil servants, and about 4,000 nurses'
aides organized by the Norwegian Health and Social Services union,
went on strike after rejecting pay raises averaging about 6
percent.
	   The unions rejected one of the highest raises offered public
employees in recent years, arguing that they needed even more to
close a pay gap between public and private workers.
	   Only the nurses' aides were ordered back to work Wednesday,
since the few nurses on strike are not considered to be a threat
against patients' lives.
	   Also on strike in Norway are about 10,000 transportation
workers, who have paralyzed bus services in several parts of the
country.

Hamas says it is ready for dialogue with America 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Palestinian group whose suicide
bombers have killed scores of civilians in Israel says it is ready
to talk to Washington, but only to ``clarify facts'' and not to
take orders.
	   ``We do not close the door in front of any dialogue with the
United States, if it wants this,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of Hamas, said in remarks published Wednesday by
the Al-Hayat newspaper.
	   He accused the United States of supporting Israel, and warned
that ``we fight our enemy and those who stand by its side.''
	   While there was no chance of talks with Israel, Hamas could
discuss matters with the United States, he was quoted as saying.
	   But the dialogue must be to ``clarify facts and not to receive
orders and dictations,'' he said.
	   Hamas opposes the U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Israel and
the Palestinians. It advocates the total destruction of Israel and
it has claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings that
killed some 80 civilians in Israel in 1996-97.
	   ``We are talking with Israel by arms and force until it knows
who is strong (and) right. We will continue to talk to it (Israel)
by this method until we liberate all Palestinian territories and
not part of it,'' he said.
	   Al-Hayat, a leading Arabic-language newspaper published in
London, interviewed Yassin in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. It
was his latest stop on a tour of Muslim countries to win support
for Hamas.
	   Yassin, who is 61-years old and quadriplegic, has so far visited
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Yemen and Syria. He is expected to travel to Pakistan and Malaysia.

De La Hoya focused, healthy heading into first fight of '98 
</HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO MONTES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ After six months off to rest and heal, WBC
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya said Wednesday he is
approaching his first fight of the year with renewed focus and
dedication.
	   De La Hoya said he feels good coming off an injury-free training
camp and is eager for a June 13 title defense against No. 1-ranked
WBC contender Patrick Charpentier. The fight has been postponed
twice.
	   ``It's getting me excited more than it would be to fight a
big-name fighter because of so many people being there,'' he said.
``That's what is keeping me alive in the sport, having the people
respond and be behind me.''
	   The bout is expected to draw more than 50,000 spectators to the
Sun Bowl and could be the biggest fight in terms of attendance
since 71,000 people saw Muhammad Ali take on Leon Spinks in the
Superdome in 1978.
	   ``That really attests to Oscar's tremendous popularity,'' said
promoter Bob Arum, who joined De La Hoya on a conference call with
reporters.
	   Despite being heavily favored, the undefeated De La Hoya (27-0,
22 knockouts) called Charpentier (27-4-1, 23 KOs) a dangerous
opponent.
	   ``He's a game fighter,'' De La Hoya said. ``He's going to come
at me and try for the knockout. I'm just going to have to stick and
move, on my toes. He can be dangerous if I stay right in front.''
	   He said he's seen Charpentier before and found him to be a
strong and aggressive fighter who is predisposed to use his head.
	   ``With this guy, the key is going to be the jab, jab, stick and
move and a lot of feints to try to confuse him,'' De La Hoya said.
	   De La Hoya was scheduled to fight Charpentier in a mandatory
defense twice before. The bout was first set for Feb. 28, but
postponed because De La Hoya suffered a left-wrist injury while
sparring. It was rescheduled for March 14, but postponed again when
doctors diagnosed a cartilage tear and ordered his wrist placed in
a cast.
	   De La Hoya's last fight was Dec. 6.
	   Asked about the boxing world's desire to see him fight against
big-name opponents, De La Hoya said he plans to take on the best
fighters of his era and is patiently awaiting an agreement that
will have him face IBF welterweight champ Felix Trinidad of Puerto
Rico.
	   Arum and De La Hoya said they're hoping a fight with Trinidad
can happen in May.
	   ``With my name and his name in boxing, it's going to create a
big event for the sport,'' De La Hoya said. ``That's the only thing
that excites me. Fighting Trinidad does not really excite me, it's
just another big fight for me.''

TV show probing Princess Diana's death criticized as ``nonsense'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Politicians and royal experts criticized a TV show
broadcast Wednesday which cast doubt over whether the Paris car
crash that killed Princess Diana on Aug. 31 was an accident.
	   The program, ``Diana - The Secrets Behind The Crash,'' featured
witnesses saying that chauffeur Henri Paul, who was killed in the
accident along with Diana's companion, Dodi Fayed, may have been
linked to the French secret service, and may have been blinded by
an anti-personal flash gun seconds before the crash.
	   The program also said that Paul's blood tests, which showed that
the chauffeur was legally drunk, may not have been reliable. It
also interviewed Diana's former lover, James Hewitt, who said that
there could have been a plot to threaten Diana's life.
	   ``The program does not suggest that Diana was murdered, but it
raises important new information which questions whether this was
an ordinary accident,'' said Steve Anderson, head of factual
programs for Independent Television.
	   Critics said that the program, which makers Granada TV said was
a documentary, was poorly researched and offered no strong
evidence.
	   ``It seems to be speculation; a lot of theories put forward by
interested parties, and I deplore it,'' royal writer Hugo Vickers
said in a television news interview after the program aired.
	   Rupert Allason, former Conservative lawmaker and security
services expert, said the TV show was ``nonsense.''
	   The program quoted a witness, Francois Levistre, who drove
through Paris' Pont de l'Alma tunnel seconds after the accident. He
said he saw a bright flash in the tunnel seconds before the
accident, which the show reported may have been an anti-personal
flash gun, designed for military use to stun victims.
	   A rival film maker, whose documentary on Diana's death
dismissing conspiracy theories is due to air Thursday, said that
French police concluded that Levistre was an unreliable witness.
	   In a February interview in The Mirror Dodi Fayed's father
Mohamed Al Fayed, who owns Harrods department store in London and
the Hotel Ritz in Paris, said that he was ``99.9 percent certain''
that the deaths of Diana and Dodi Fayed were not an accident, and
that the two were engaged. He has offered no independent evidence,
and has been strongly criticized by some in Britain for his claims.
	   French Investigators have focused on several factors that may
have caused the crash: that the Mercedes car Diana and Dodi were in
was traveling at a high rate of speed while Paul sought to evade
photographers, and that Paul was legally drunk. Authorities have
also sought a car that may have collided with the Mercedes shortly
before the crash.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks slid into the close Wednesday, once again
failing to sustain an early advance as the market remained
handcuffed by worries about company profits. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 87.44 points _ or 1 percent _ to 8,803.80,
turning lower late in the session for the second straight day.
Broader stock indexes also surrendered early gains and then fell
sharply over the final 90 minutes. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The Boeing Co. is halting production of the MD-11
jetliner because of insufficient demand for the triple-engine
plane. ``Despite our best marketing efforts, it became clear to us
that there simply was not enough customer interest in either the
passenger or freighter versions of this airplane to justify keeping
the production line open,'' Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group, said Wednesday in a news release.
Production of the MD-11 will be phased out with the delivery of
orders now on hand, with the last delivery scheduled for February
2000. As of April, there were 22 commitments, including firm
orders, options and reserves for the triple-engine jet that can be
made for cargo or passenger usage. (US-BOEING-MD11)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The prospect of a World Cup undermined by travel
chaos grew Wednesday, with Air France pilots striking for a third
day, and other pay disputes threatening to paralyze the transport
sector. Baggage handlers stayed off the job, forcing passengers to
carry their own luggage for a second day at Paris' biggest airport.
The capital's subway workers planned a metro strike and national
railworkers prepared a walkout, as did airline mechanics. Top
French government ministers and World Cup officials appeared
embarrassed by the labor unrest, which could derail the world's
biggest international sporting event. (AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian stock market rallied for a second day
Wednesday, buoyed by rumors that the country's flailing economy
might soon be rescued by a hefty international aid package.
However, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, arriving in Paris for
talks with French officials, continued to play down the rumors, and
a Finance Ministry spokesman reiterated that Moscow hasn't sought
emergency aid _ at least not formally. ``The Russian government
hasn't officially turned to foreign financial institutions with a
request for emergency aid,'' spokesman Oleg Zhukov said. However,
he did say the government is negotiating about new borrowing from
Western commercial banks, and possibly from the International
Monetary Fund. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ The European Union came together with its
Mediterranean partners Wednesday, trying to get the economic
cooperation process back on track after last year's derailment by
Mideast issues. Despite the will to refocus on economic issues,
however, the increasing violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo
and the impasse in the Middle East peace talks threatened to push
their way on to the agenda of the 15 EU foreign ministers and their
12 Mediterranean colleagues Wednesday and Thursday. The Palermo
meeting is an informal session with no set agenda. Organizers hoped
it would bring the conference back to its original idea of creating
a European-Mediterranean free trade and security zone by the year
2010. (EU-MEDITERRANEAN)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Taking aim at a market long dominated
by U.S. car manufacturers, Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG of Germany
are teaming up to build a sports utility vehicle. The two
automakers, in a joint statement released Wednesday, said they hope
to launch the new vehicle in the year 2002. Each company will sell
its the vehicles under its own name. Porsche will oversee the
development of the vehicle, while Volkswagen will be in charge of
producing it. The companies expect annual sales of about 100,000
vehicles. Company officials said they were optimistic about
entering the sports utility market, one of the hottest segments of
the auto industry. (GERMANY-VOLKSWAGEN-PORSCHE)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Hurtling with a momentum that piled
train cars one atop another in twisted heaps of steel, Germany's
fastest passenger train derailed and jackknifed Wednesday when the
lead locomotive broke loose. State officials said at least 100
people were killed. Traveling at a speed of 200 kilometers (125
miles) an hour, car after car slammed into an overpass, bringing
the bridge crashing down upon the wreckage and the dead and
wounded. Houses just 50 yards (150 feet) away were unscathed,
protected by an embankment. The cause of Germany's worst train
accident since World War II remained unclear late Wednesday, and
officials were unsure how many people were aboard Hamburg-bound ICE
884. Lower-Saxony state officials said at least 300 people injured.
(GERMANY-TRAIN-DERAILS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Xavier Solana
reiterated Wednesday that the 16-member alliance was keeping ``all
options open,'' including a military reply to Serbia's violent
crackdown on a separatist movement in southern Kosovo province. The
NATO ambassadors reiterated they will consider sending combat
troops to those nations. They also agreed to accelerate plans to
help Albania and Macedonia seal their borders with Kosovo.
Thousands of refugees have fled the violence in Kosovo, where Serb
police and army forces have stepped-up their campaign since late
May to crush the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army. More than
200 people have been killed in the southern Serb province where 90
percent of the population are ethnic Albanians. (NATO-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Opening an annual battle with Congress, U.S.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday proposed renewing normal trade
relations with China, saying ``this policy is clearly in our
nation's interest.'' Announcing his decision in the Rose Garden,
Clinton said that failure to renew normal trade ties would sever
the United States' economic and strategic relationship with
Beijing. Further, he said it would amount to ``turning our back on
a fourth of the world at a time when our cooperation for world
peace and security is specially important in light of the recent
events in South Asia.'' He was referring to nuclear tensions
between India and Pakistan. Many in Congress oppose the president's
policy. This year's battle is complicated by questions about the
administration's technology transfers to Beijing as well as
investigations in alleged Chinese campaign contributions.
(US-CHINA)
	   SENAFE, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopian artillery fire echoed in
Eritrean valleys Wednesday, and black smoke curled from villages
abandoned by frightened farmers and their families. Officials in
both Horn of Africa countries accused each other of cross-border
attacks, dimming hopes for a peaceful solution to their border
dispute. Hundreds of Eritrean soldiers marched towards defensive
positions, while pickup trucks loaded with lightly wounded troops

	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ One of apartheid's most notorious
killers testified Wednesday in former President P.W. Botha's trial
that white-led governments ordered black activists killed. He
denounced his former leaders as ``cowards.'' Former police Col.
Eugene de Kock arrived in an armored personnel carrier at the
courthouse, where Botha is on trial for refusing to appear before a
panel probing apartheid crimes. The case has turned into an
examination of Botha's possible complicity in state-sanctioned
killings and violence when he was head of state from 1978-1989 and
presided over the State Security Council, which coordinated the
crackdown against opponents of white rule. (SOUTH AFRICA-BOTHA

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw's Marriott hotel proved to be an
easy target for stunt climber Alain Robert, who avoided security
agents Wednesday and scaled the 41-story glass tower using only his
bare hands.
	   Robert, dubbed the Spiderman for his worldwide climbing
exploits, climbed up to the roof of the 146-meter (480-foot) hotel
in about 20 minutes. Upon reaching the top, he was detained for two
hours by police, then released.
	   After his first attempt on Tuesday was foiled, Robert kept his
plan secret and did not inform the media of the attempt.
	   On Tuesday, police and security agents prevented Robert from
making the stunt and stopped him when he appeared on the roof of a
shopping center surrounding the hotel.
	   Robert, 35, of Valance, France, makes his living scaling tall
buildings as publicity stunts. He uses only his bare hands and no
cords or rigging.
	   He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the world's
fifth-tallest _ the Empire State Building in New York City.
	   Robert, making his first appearance in eastern Europe, was
invited by a Polish company that makes climbing gear.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Grammy-winning singer Anne Murray and her
husband, Bill Langstroth, have separated after 23 years of
marriage.
	   ``It was by mutual consent and there are no plans for a
divorce,'' spokeswoman Marlene Palmer said Tuesday. ``They're still
the best of friends.''
	   The couple have a 20-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter.
	   Ms. Murray's hits include ``Snowbird,'' ``Danny's Song,'' ``You
Needed Me'' and ``Could I Have This Dance.''
	   ___
	   ST. OLAF, Iowa (AP) _ What's a lefse hurling contest without the
lefse?
	   Politically correct, say the organizers of the Uff-Da Daze
celebration at St. Olaf.
	   The traditional paper-thin bread is considered nearly as sacred
as a Communion wafer among Norwegians, said Dave Doerscher, event
co-chairman in the town of 140.
	   ``I'll tell you what,'' said expert baker Phyllis Thurn of St.
Olaf. ``Around here, anybody who makes lefse is not about to let
anybody throw it.''
	   This will be the fourth year for Uff-Da Daze, a benefit for the
city-owned, Depression-era St. Olaf auditorium. Uff-da, said Thurn,
is an all-purpose Norwegian expression denoting anything from joy
to disgust.
	   But what about the lack of lefse? Doerscher said flour tortillas
will work just fine.
	   ``We put 'em in the refrigerator, and at our planning meeting
the other night they sailed real well. Sorta like a Frisbee,'' he
said.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A city effort to force most of New York's
X-rated businesses to move got the go-ahead Wednesday from a
federal appeals court.
	   The dispute started with city efforts to clean up Times Square.
	   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said all the legal issues
had been sufficiently argued in state court.
	   The ruling opens the door for enforcement of a zoning regulation
requiring sex businesses to be at least 500 feet away from each
other and not be near schools or houses of worship.
	   As many as 150 of the city's 177 sex businesses could be forced
to move.
	   Strip club owners, patrons and employees argued the new zoning
law violated their First Amendment rights. They took their case to
federal court after the state's highest court upheld the rule in
March.
	   ___
	   LAWRENCEVILLE, Georgia (AP) _ A 65-cent candy bar wound up
costing James Holcomb dlrs 1,000.
	   A Gwinnett County jury handed up the final bill on Tuesday,
deciding that Holcomb must pay for tossing the last two bites of
his Baby Ruth out of his van and striking a cyclist in the leg.
	   ``I saw him, but I didn't think it would hit him,'' Holcomb, 20,
said after the two-day trial. ``He had every right to feel it was
dangerous. I definitely learned from this.''
	   Cyclist Brendan Kerger swerved when the bit of candy struck him,
but he didn't fall. His leg was bruised and he missed a few days of
work, but Kerger didn't decide to sue until Holcomb tried to make a
joke of the incident with police.
	   ``It was a matter of principle,'' said Kerger, 47. ``I wasn't
very seriously injured, but I could have been killed.''
	   Jurors awarded Kerger dlrs 200 for medical bills, dlrs 180 for
lost wages for missing three days of work and dlrs 620 for pain and
suffering.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Advertising executives are
refusing to show a film protesting Nigeria's human rights record
during the half-time break of Friday's live television broadcast of
Nigeria's World Cup warm-up match with the Netherlands.
	   The 30-second film, made by human rights group Amnesty
International, was judged too violent to be shown at half-time of
the nationally-televised match, Amnesty spokeswoman Karin Buschman
said Wednesday.
	   ``It shows a goalkeeper standing in goal waiting and instead of
saving a shot, he is executed,'' Buschman said.
	   Amnesty is among a number of Dutch groups using the match as a
platform to protest Nigeria's human rights record.
	   Announcements placed in Wednesday's Dutch national newspapers
drew the public's attention to an ``alternative Nigerian team'' of
12 imprisoned or harassed human rights, environmental or trade
union activists.
	   The announcement was sponsored by Dutch environmental and human
rights groups but also trade unions and religious organizations.
	   The friendly is being played eight days before the Netherlands
takes on Belgium in its first match in World Cup qualifying Group E
and Nigeria takes on Spain in Group D.
	   ___  
	   PARIS (AP) _ A lot will happen at the biggest ever World Cup,
but goal-scoring record holder Just Fontaine need not worry _ just
yet.
	   Despite Ronaldo, Batistuta, Shearer and a slew of other prolific
strikers, it is unlikely his record of 13 goals in one World Cup
tournament will fall.
	   Forty years after setting the record at the 1958 World Cup in
Sweden, Fontaine is a star all over again.
	   ``I'd better enjoy it, because the next time it's in France,
I'll be in my coffin,'' the 64-year-old Frenchman said.
	   No one has come close since, and the top-scoring title is now
regularly going to a striker who gets a half dozen goals.
	   ___  
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne was not the only England player
drinking in La Manga the night before coach Glenn Hoddle announced
he was dropping the controversial midfielder from the World Cup
team.
	   England's No. 1 goalkeeper David Seaman said ``quite a few''
other England internationals were also drunk at a team party at
their training base in southern Spain.
	   Hoddle cut the 31-year-old star Sunday because he said he was
out of shape, setting off a controversy about whether one of
England's best midfielders should have made the team.
	   Gascoigne later admitted he was drunk at the party and then said
he was drinking beer during a golf game Sunday just hours before
Hoddle gave him the bad news.
	   ___  
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss FIFA presidential hopeful Sepp
Blatter had conciliatory words for his Swedish rival Lennart
Johansson in a magazine interview published Wednesday.
	   ``Personally I have no problem with him, but people around him
are putting him under pressure,'' FIFA general secretary Blatter
was quoted as saying in the Swiss weekly Schweizer Illustrierte.
	   That pressure was leading UEFA President Johansson, the only
other candidate to take over the presidency of world soccer's
governing body, to say things that ``have nothing to do with fair
play,'' he continued.
	   The 198-member FIFA Congress, meeting Monday in Paris, will
choose a successor to Joao Havelange, the Brazilian who has
directed the sport through 24 years of unprecedented commercial
success.
	   The election brings to an end a bitter battle between the two
rivals.
	   ___  
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's
second-half goal gave Yugoslavia a 1-0 victory over fellow World
Cup qualifier Japan in an evenly balanced friendly match Wednesday.
	   Hidetoshi Nakata of Bellmare Hiratsuka missed two good chances
for Japan before Sinisa, who plays for Italian club Sampdoria,
scored for Yugoslavia in the 71st minute.
	   It was Japan's final warm-up match against another national
side. Yugoslavia plays non-qualifier Switzerland in Basel Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ French players could face the gun
if they're injured during the World Cup.
	   The French team plans to use the Cryo'One, a gun that sprays a
freezing gas on a player's injury, during the tournament.
	   It looks like it's right out of Star Trek, but apparently it
works.
	   ``It gets them healed a lot quicker. They're back in 48 hours,''
said French coach Aime Jacquet.
	   Some teams still swear by the trusty sponge, others use gas
canisters, but the Cryo'One is by far the most sophisticated devise
so far.
	   ``It's medical science of the modern era,'' said Jacquet.
	   It doesn't take care of serious injuries, but it should soothe
any hard knocks and have a player back in no time, the French team
hopes. France is the only one of the 32 teams using the device.
	   ___  
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ FIFA presidential hopeful Joseph
Blatter emphasized his commitment to award the 2006 World Cup to an
African country as he hit the campaign trail in battle-torn
Liberia.
	   Blatter, who met with local soccer officials and Liberian star
George Weah, also promised to increase funding to sport programs in
this West African country which in 1996 emerged from seven years of
civil war.
	   Blatter, who is currently FIFA secretary general, was invited to
Liberia by Weah, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters.
	   ``I will not give you all of my programs for Africa right
here,'' Blatter said. ``What I can promise is that if elected
president of FIFA on June 8, I will give the 2006 World Cup to
Africa.''
	   ___  
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ For a politician with a big say on
national affairs, French president Jacques Chirac has been
unusually quiet about who should play for France during the World
Cup.
	   This despite the fact officials considered his presence
important enough for the squad to swap training venues so his
helicopter could land for a team engagement.
	   With coach Aime Jacquet remaining tight-lipped amidst much
juggling of the team the past two weeks, speculation mounted that
even leading scorer Youri Djorkaeff could be benched for France's
June 12 opener against South Africa.
	   ``You cannot just stick to what has already been set out. You
need a breath of fresh air,'' Jacquet said. ``I prefer movement,
even if it's not major.''
	   Djorkaeff, a key member of France's squad throughout Jacquet's
four-year tenure, said he was part of the Jacquet system and could
not see any reason why he would be excluded now.
	   ___  
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Greeted by a large crowd of
cheering fans and friends, striker Romario returned to Brazil on
Wednesday after being dropped from the Brazilian World Cup squad
because of an injured right calf.
	   ``I went to France full of happiness and surrounded by
friends,'' Romario said shortly after arriving at Rio de Janeiro's
international airport. ``I return alone and full of sadness.''
	   ``My dream of helping Brazil win its fifth world cup was
shattered, he added.
	   ``There was a lack of patience. I know how my body functions and
I know I would have the physical conditions to play.''
	   Romario said he plans to be fully recovered in 15 days when he
expects to resume playing for Rio's Flamengo.
	   A poll conducted by the O Globo newspaper showed that 50 percent
of Rio de Janeiro's residents agrees that Romario should have been
dropped from the team. Another 45.5 percent said he should have
remained.

Annan recommends strengthening UN military presence in Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With violence escalating in Kosovo, U.N.
chief Kofi Annan is recommending U.N. peacekeepers stay in
neighboring Macedonia until at least February and is raising the
possibility of more U.N. soldiers heading to the region.
	   The 750 U.N. troops, including nearly 340 Americans, is
scheduled to leave Macedonia at the end of August. They were sent
there in 1992 to prevent the spread of the ethnic conflict in other
parts of the former Yugoslavia.
	   In a report Wednesday to the Security Council, Annan said that
in light of increased violence in Kosovo and discussions within
NATO about an ``expanded international presence in the region,'' it
would be ``premature to proceed with a decision to withdraw'' the
force.
	   Annan suggested the council consider keeping the force in
Macedonia for another six months. He also said he would submit a
report next month with ``specific proposals on a possible
strengthening of the force's overall capacity.''
	   Although he did not specifically say that ``possible
strengthening'' should include more troops, Annan noted that the
peacekeepers were overstressed.
	   He said the troops had already increased its patrols along the
Macedonian border with Kosovo, a province of the Serb republic of
Yugoslavia, established 24-hour observation posts and begun boat
patrols in the Ohrid and Prespa lakes on the Albanian frontier.
	   ``Such intensive monitoring, however, cannot be sustained over a
long period of time with the current troop strength,'' he said.
	   Annan also noted that the Macedonian government had asked that
the troops remain. Last month, NATO foreign ministers also
recommended the U.N. troops stay in Macedonia.
	   At their meeting in Luxembourg, the NATO ministers agreed on
increased cooperation to help Albania and Macedonia patrol their
borders and joint-exercises with forces from the two Balkan
nations.
	   The ministers also agreed to step up assistance programs under
which NATO has been sending small teams of military advisors to
help them secure their borders with Kosovo. They also decided to
hold maneuvers in Albania with land and air forces in August.
	   Planned joint-exercises September in Macedonia will be upgraded.
	   The U.N. operation, formally known as the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force, includes troops from six nations. They
are Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Norway and Sweden in addition to
the United States.

Semifinals showcase four very different women 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By JOCELYN NOVECK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four women, all with different stories.
	   There's Aranxta Sanchez Vicario, the sturdy Spaniard who's had a
long career at the top of women's tennis, but hasn't won a Grand
Slam title since 1994.
	   There's Lindsay Davenport, the American girl next door who
describes herself as ``just an ordinary girl playing tennis. A
boring story.''
	   There's Martina Hingis, sitting at the very pinnacle of the
tennis world, with only the French Open missing from her collection
of titles.
	   And, with the most poignant story, there's Monica Seles, playing
two weeks after the death of her father, mentor and coach, Karolj
Seles. She's managed to channel her grief into a renewed
determination to win here.
	   The four women play Thursday in a semifinal round that's one of
the most compelling in years.
	   In the first match, Sanchez Vicario will be trying to recapture
the form that brought her to three Grand Slam titles: the 1989 and
1994 French Opens, and the 1994 U.S. Open.
	   She's already demonstrated her well-known grit this week.
Against Serena Williams in the fourth round, she was down one set
and losing 2-5 in the second. Yet she hung in long enough for
Williams to start falling apart, and played shrewdly to take the
match.
	   She also showed her competitive fire. ``I taught her a lesson,''
she said angrily afterwards, saying Williams hadn't shown respect
during an on-court encounter.
	   She faces Lindsay Davenport, maybe one of the most modest
semifinalists ever. Asked earlier in the week if she felt
overlooked here, she replied, ``If I were a betting person or a
journalist, I'd overlook myself also.'' But Davenport is the No. 2
seed here, and may be ready to prove she can win a big one on clay.
	   Hingis has little left to prove. The 17-year-old Swiss star is
at the top of her game, and her innate court sense and impeccable
timing have served her well this week.
	   Her swift victory over Serena Williams' big sister, Venus, in
the quarterfinals only outlined the gap between the two, despite
hopes for a new rivalry in women's tennis.
	   Hingis has rolled through the first five rounds, losing just 21
games.
	   But it is Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam champion, who is the
emotional favorite this year at Roland Garros.
	   Playing with her father's ring around her neck, she says she
came here so soon after his death because the memories at home were
just too painful. And, of course, because ``my dad would have loved
me to play.''
	   Beating Novotna in the quarters, she clenched her fist and
scrunched her face into a victory grimace that made it clear how
much she wants this title, which she's won three times before.
	   But the crowd's emotional support won't be enough; she has to be
at her very best. Hingis has defeated Seles all five times they've
played.
	   The men have a day off Thursday, which is a relief for the weary
Cedric Pioline.
	   The Frenchman withstood five sets of sloppy and often tedious
tennis Wednesday to became the only non-Spaniard in the men's
semifinals.
	   His 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-3 win over Morocco's Hicham
Arazi _ a match marred by 149 unforced errors _ put him in the
semifinals with Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya and Felix Mantilla.
	   ``I was so tired and I had break points against me practically
in every game. I saved some of them by miracle,'' Pioline said.
	   He became the first Frenchman to reach the semifinals at Roland
Garros since Henri Leconte in 1992. Just two Frenchmen have won the
title since World War II, with Yannick Noah the most recent in
1983.
	   Arazi, who played most of the match with a blistered left foot,
converted only five of his 21 break points.
	   ``I'm going to jump into the Seine River,'' he cracked. ``The
thing that really did me in is that I stayed too much on the
baseline.''
	   Pioline, who has played three five-set matches in the
tournament, will have a day to rest before facing Corretja in
Friday's semifinals.
	   Corretja made just 18 unforced errors while reaching his first
Grand Slam semifinal by defeating Belgium's Filip Dewulf 7-5, 6-4,
6-3.
	   ``This is history,'' Corretja said. ``It's not easy to have a
country put three guys in the semis of a Grand Slam. We used to see
the American guys in other tournaments, but not the Spanish guys.''

While others finally arrive, French flee their own country

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ While the other World Cup nations
are glad to finally make to France, the French flee.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet and his 22 players fly to Finland early
Thursday, much more to escape the pressure and commotion of being
the host nation than to play the Finish national team.
	   Even after Friday evening's final preparation game, the team
will enjoy the relative peace of their lakeside hotel close to
Helsinki for another two days before returning to the
pressure-cooker at home.
	   ``It's always refreshing to travel,'' said Jacquet, stressing
the daily drone of monotony would finally get the players down.
	   France's first game is June 12 against South Africa in
Marseille. Denmark and Saudi Arabia complete Group C.
	   With their flight to Finland, some of the French stars are just
happy to get away from the fans and media.
	   ``We'll be able to walk the streets in peace. Our friends won't
call us all the time and,'' said defender Marcel Desailly, eying
the throng of journalists around him, ``you won't be there.''
	   The last dinner was spent with French President Jacques Chirac,
who assured the team he had a ``strong intuition'' he would be able
to present them the World Cup on July 12.
	   Meanwhile, the media has started speculating heavily on the
starting lineup, even suggesting star forward Youri Djorkaeff will
be benched.
	   Jacquet has not been much help to smooth the waters, refusing to
give away any clue. Goalkeeper will be Monaco's Fabien Barthez and
the defense is almost cast in stone with a back four of Lilian
Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu.
	   Captain Didier Deschamps is defensive midfielder and Zinedine
Zidane the playmaker. That leaves four places open for discussion,
including Djorkaeff's.
	   Jacquet's main selection problems have been up front, and the
sudden emergence as potential starters Thierry Henry and Robert
Pires on the wings could alter plans at the last moment, forcing
out a player in the middle.
	   But Djorkaeff's mind is set. ``I have no doubts on the field. I
have confidence.''
	   In midfield, Real Madrid Christian Karembeu long looked a
certainty, especially since he should be much fitter after having
played only half a season. But a disappointing few weeks have cast
major doubt on his place and increased the chances of Arsenal
Emmanuel Petit. Jacquet already benched Karembeu for a preparation
game last week.
	   ``I was so frustrated. I wanted to play and I was on the bench,
powerless,'' he said.

Five months after daring escape, El Duque makes big league debut AP Baseball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He risked his life on a flimsy boat, fleeing
Cuba the day after Christmas and floating toward an uncertain
future.
	   And on Wednesday night _ thanks to a dog bite _ El Duque
completed another sort of journey.
	   Now pitching for the New York Yankees, Orlando Hernandez.
	   Cheered on by Cuban flags and encouraged by his half-brother,
World Series MVP Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins, ``The
Duke'' made his U.S. major league debut against the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays.
	   Hernandez, wearing his navy socks nearly up to his knees, showed
off his impressive assortment of pitches from the start, striking
out Quinton McCracken to begin the game. He then retired Miguel
Cairo and Wade Boggs on fly balls, finishing off a perfect first
inning on just 10 pitches.
	   ``I know he's got to be thinking about what he went through the
last year of his life,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said before the
game. ``When he boarded that boat, he wasn't sure what was ahead.
It takes a lot of bravery.''
	   One of the most heralded pitchers in Cuban history, Hernandez
got his chance when Wednesday night's scheduled starter, David
Cone, was bitten on his right index finger by his mother's
4-month-old Jack Russell terrier.
	   Hernandez already was in town because the Yankees thought they
might need him Tuesday night to start in place of David Wells, who
had a sore shoulder.
	   ``I wish him luck and congratulate him on his big league
debut,'' said Livan, the losing pitcher Wednesday in the Marlins'
5-1 defeat at Chicago. ``I'm very happy. I hope he doesn't do as
bad as I did today.
	   ``I talked to him last five days ago. I have been calling him,
but he must have turned off his cell phone,'' he said.
	   The Marlins, as it turned out, left Wrigley Field to take a
flight to New York, where they play the Yankees in an interleague
series this weekend. The team was scheduled to arrive on Wednesday
night and Livan was hoping to hustle to the park to see Orlando
pitch.
	   Since his defection from Cuba, where he earned about dlrs 10 a
month as a physical therapist, Hernandez signed a dlrs 6.6 million,
four-year contract with the Yankees and proved he could pitch in
the minors.
	   At Triple-A Columbus, Hernandez was 6-0 with a 3.83 ERA in seven
starts, striking out 59 in 42 1-3 innings. He last started for the
Clippers on Thursday, beating Ottawa 9-6.
	   Torre said he was looking to get six innings from the
right-hander in his first major league outing. No matter how well
he pitches, however, Hernandez is likely headed back to Columbus,
for now.
	   ``This is why he's here, to make one start,'' Torre said. ``His
future is tonight. Maybe we'll see more of him later this year.''
	   More uncertain is Hernandez's age. The Yankees had been saying
he was 28, although there was speculation he might be older.
	   Inside the ballpark, even his opponents were eager to see him.
That included his friend, Tampa Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo, who
defected from Cuba in 1996.
	   ``It is hard for me to explain how I am feeling tonight,'' he
said through an interpreter. ``This is my first time to see Yankee
Stadium, and now I am seeing a Cuban pitch here.
	   ``I still want Tampa Bay to win,'' he said. ``But if El Duque
wins, I would like to go out and celebrate with him.''

Nikko Securities to reduce overseas presence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Major brokerage Nikko Securities Co. will close
about two-thirds of its overseas subsidiaries and representative
offices by the end of this year, a Japanese newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Operations of the 20 units will be transferred to Salomon Smith
Barney, the securities unit of New York-based Travelers Group Inc.,
the Nihon Keizai business newspaper reported, quoting Nikko
President Masashi Kaneko.
	   The decision comes on the heels of Monday's announcement that
Travelers would take a one-quarter stake in Nikko, Japan's
third-largest brokerage house.
	   Reducing its overseas network will save Nikko more than 100
billion yen (dlrs 721 million), which will be used to reinvigorate
domestic operations focusing on individual investors, the daily
reported.
	   Nikko Europe PLC and other major foreign units in the U.S. and
Europe will likely be closed, while about 10 of the brokerage's
offices in Asia and elsewhere will take over operations and staff
from branches of its U.S. unit, the daily reported.
	   ``We'll compare the overseas operations of Nikko and Travelers
with the stronger ones likely absorbing the weaker ones on a
practical basis,'' Kaneko told the daily.
	   Nikko also plans to renovate its existing domestic outlets and
open small retail branches, with the number of domestic outlets
possibly increasing to 300, or about 2.5 times the current amount,
in the medium-term, the paper reported.

Organization of American States raps Brazil for Human Rights Violations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Organization of American
States has condemned Brazil for human rights violations in
connection with the 1985 murder of a union leader, relatives of the
victim and rights groups said Wednesday.
	   According to James Cavallaro, director of Human Rights Watch
Brazil, the Inter American Human Rights Commission of the OAS will
present its charges Thursday at a meeting in Washington.
	   The Brazilian government is charged with failing to protect Joao
Canuto, a union leader in the Amazon city of Rio Maria who had been
receiving death threats for some time.
	   On Dec. 18, 1985 Canuto was shot to death in Rio Maria, some
1,300 miles (2,100 kms) northwest of Rio de Janeiro, by two gunmen
believed to have been working for local farmers and politicians.
	   Following a seven-year-long investigation ending in 1992, five
people _ including the city's mayor and a local rancher _ were
accused of participating in the murder but not a single defendant
gone to trial.
	   ``The government had more than enough time to investigate the
murders. It's been 12 years and no one has been punished and during
that time my father's killers have killed again,'' said Luiza
Canuto, who had two of her brothers murdered in 1990.
	   The OAS is an association of 34 countries who work for peace and
democracy in the Americas. Its powers are purely on the level of
diplomatic persuasion.
	   While, in practical terms, the condemnation is little more than
a slap on the wrist, Cavallaro believes the international attention
of such violations might lead to changes in the government's human
rights policy.
	   ``Besides being the first time the organization has condemned
Brazil for Human Rights violations, the condemnation is important
because it comes from the only body Brazil recognizes in the area
of human rights.'' said Cavallaro.
	   According to Human Wrights Watch there have been 683 politically
motivated murders of in the Amazon state of Para in 20 years.

War in Kosovo: How will world react to new Balkan challenge? With Yugoslavia-Kosovo, UN-Macedonia 
</HEADLINE>
By ALISON SMALE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The world may have another Balkan
war on its hands in the Serbian province of Kosovo, and how the
United States and other foreign powers respond will test what they
learned from the years of hesitation over Bosnia.
	   The risks are higher in this round of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic vs. the world. For 3 1-2 years starting in 1992,
war consumed Bosnia. Kosovo, with its ethnic Albanian majority,
would suck neighboring Albania and Macedonia's Albanian minority
into the conflict.
	   That could touch off an all-out Balkan war if Macedonia, already
a fragile neighbor, disintegrates into conflict between its
Albanians and Slavs. Others in Europe, including NATO members
Greece and Turkey, would end up on different sides.
	   That's one reason NATO has sounded much more urgent about Kosovo
than it did when war began in Bosnia. NATO officials met Wednesday
to discuss dispatching alliance troops to Albania and Macedonia to
contain Kosovo's war.
	   War in Kosovo has been predicted for so long that it began to
sound like Balkan scaremongering. Now, with shell-shocked refugees,
an increasingly fierce assault on civilians, talk of ethnic
cleansing and escalating force on both sides, it is sounding on the
ground like war.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, the clandestine group seeking an
independence neither Serbia nor the world want to grant, has grown
since Serbian police began a March crackdown. The KLA claims to
control about 40 percent of the province.
	   Fighting already has shut down Pristina airport and some major
roads. The KLA is just 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Pristina,
and perilously close to the main Pristina-Belgrade road, where
heavily armed police patrol constantly against attacks from hills
just west.
	   The Yugoslav army is trying to break the KLA by razing villages
and giving militants no place to hide.
	   Traditionally, Serbs regard Kosovo as the cradle of their
culture and say they would do anything to defend it. But most have
never been there, and are demoralized after 11 years of Milosevic
rule, which has brought war, sanctions, hardship and decay.
	   A report in Wednesday's Belgrade daily Telegraf said 100 city
policemen have been fired for refusing to go to Kosovo and fight.
	   Still, Milosevic traditionally is at his wily best when waging a
war. He also long has killed in Kosovo without provoking much
Western response: In 1989, at least 25 Albanians died in one day
when he stripped the province of its autonomy. No foreign
government protested.
	   But Milosevic's hold on power is increasingly stretched.
Serbia's sole remaining partner in Yugoslavia, Montenegro, is now
led by an anti-Milosevic man and could break away from the
federation.
	   Such tension may produce increasingly erratic responses from
Milosevic _ and begin a new chapter in Yugoslavia's bloody
disintegration.
	     ___
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Alison Smale, Vienna bureau chief for The
Associated Press, has covered the Balkans since 1986.

Jewish settler group stakes claims to Arab Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos JRL101-102
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yellow stars spill across an aerial photograph
of Jerusalem's Old City, beachheads in a Jewish settler group's
long campaign to ``reclaim Jerusalem.'' Each of the 30 stars marks
a building in the Muslim and Christian quarters taken over by the
group, Ateret Cohanim, and now occupied by Jews.
	   Ateret Cohanim stormed back into the public eye last week when
it set up seven tin sheds just inside the Muslim Quarter's walls,
setting off scuffles with Palestinian legislators.
	   City workers demolished the unauthorized sheds, but a Jerusalem
city planning commission on Wednesday heard a proposal from Ateret
Cohanim to build high-rise apartments and a school there, Israel's
Channel Two television reported.
	   Leading a tour of American supporters on Wednesday, Ateret
Cohanim tour guide Bracha Slae called the Muslim Quarter ``the new
up-and-coming Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem.''
	   Ateret Cohanim's campaign to move Jews into Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhoods threatens to push tensions in the divided city to the
boiling point. Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini called this week
for mass street protests, saying diplomacy alone was not enough to
block Jewish settlement in Jerusalem.
	   Over the past 18 years, Ateret Cohanim has moved more than 65
families into 40 to 50 buildings scattered throughout the Old
City's Muslim and Christian quarters, according to Slae. Ateret
Cohanim owns many more buildings it has not yet been able to move
into, she said.
	   The group, heavily funded by Florida multimillionaire Irving
Moskowitz, says its goal is to restore the Jewish presence to parts
of Jerusalem where it disappeared following Arab riots in the 1920s
and `30s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Ateret Cohanim received
secret funding from right-wing Israeli governments.
	   The idea of Jews living in Arab neighborhoods _ and vice versa _
seems unremarkable to an outsider. But in practice, mixed
neighborhoods are virtually unheard of in Jerusalem, and any change
to the character and makeup of the city's neighborhoods has been an
explosive issue, with both sides fearing land grabs before
Jerusalem's final status is determined in peace talks.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War, as capital of a future state. Israel insists
the city must remain undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
	   ``They don't want to be neighbors,'' Ibrahim Mohammed, a
maintenance worker who lives in the Muslim Quarter, said of Ateret
Cohanim. ``They want to get rid of everybody else.
	   ``They're willing to pay huge amounts of money for any little
corner, and then keep expanding until they take over the whole
city.''
	   Ateret Cohanim said it set up the sheds in the Muslim Quarter
last week in retaliation for last month's stabbing death of a
student from the group's religious seminary. Another Cohanim
student was killed in November. Palestinian militants were
suspected in both attacks.
	   After each of the deaths, Ateret Cohanim vowed to step up its
campaign.
	   ``We are making an effort to bring in massive numbers of
people,'' Slae said Wednesday.
	   Slae insisted that Ateret Cohanim believes in coexistence, and
works within the law. But because Palestinians who sell to Jews
face retribution _ and possibly death _ at the hands of fellow
Arabs, she said the group works secretly, sometimes helping sellers
relocate out of the area, or agreeing to take possession of a
property only after the seller dies.
	   ``The difficulties are very great,'' Slae said. ``We get a lot
of bad publicity.''
	   Standing on the roof of a three-story Ateret Cohanim building in
the Muslim Quarter, Slae looked out over mosque minarets and church
steeples and picked out the Israeli flags identifying the group's
properties.
	   Her voice nearly drowned out by the clamor of church bells, Slae
said Ateret Cohanim had a long list of young couples who want to
move into the Old City, but did not yet have permission to build on
the property it owns.
	   ``What we need is pressure,'' she said. ``And money.''

Dollar higher, stocks lower in early Tokyo trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in early
trading Thursday amid continuing uncertainty over Russian financial
markets. Stock prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 138.30 yen, up 0.54 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 138.75 yen overnight.
	   Worries that Russia may be the next victim of the financial
turmoil that has swept through many Asian economies have hung over
world financial markets in recent days.
	   Investors are assuming that Russia will be the prime topic of
discussion at the Paris meeting of finance officials from the Group
of Seven industrialized nations next week.
	   The German mark's strength against the yen was also giving the
dollar some support. But traders said the U.S. currency is unlikely
to rise further because of growing anxiety over whether the G-7
meeting will address the yen's recent weakness.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average slipped 12.68 points, or 0.08 percent, to 15,334.32 points
in the first 30 minutes of morning trading. On Wednesday, the index
lost 207.45 points, or 1.33 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.82 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,203.51.
The TOPIX lost 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Prices slipped as investors sold shares on persistent worries
that Japan's stagnant economy is getting worse.
	   Electronics shares in Tokyo were lower following the overnight
fall in technology shares in New York, where Intel plunged nearly 5
percent on concerns about the chip-maker's earnings prospects.
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond edged up to 1.155 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.150

Sugar crop failure leaves 80,000 Fijians destitute 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ About 80,000 people, 10 percent of Fiji's
population, will need government aid for up to a year to avert
starvation and destitution caused by the country's worst drought on
record, government officials said Thursday.
	   The drought is estimated by the Fiji Sugar Corp., operator of
the country's four sugar mills, to have cut the 1998 harvest from
the normal level of about 4 million metric tons of cane to only 1.7
million tons, with months more dry weather ahead.
	   The district officer for Ba province, Tomasi Mucunibutu, said in
his western Fiji area alone almost all of 43,000 people surveyed
would need some form of state help. He will be recommending food
and other assistance.
	   In some districts small-scale farmers have lost their entire
sugar cane crop and face months of destitution, according to a
government survey.
	   The government plans to divert U.S. dlrs 18 million for drought
relief, but is becoming involved in a bitter dispute with cane
growers' leaders who insist that nothing less than outright cash
grants are needed by growers.
	   Sugar Cane is the core of the Fiji economy. The drought is
expected by the Fiji Sugar Corp. to cost at least U.S. dlrs 50
million (100 million Fiji dollars) in lost sugar export earnings.

	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Pounding rains that turned roads to
muck have grounded aid helicopters carrying urgently needed food
and medical supplies to survivors of a massive earthquake in
northern Afghanistan that killed as many as 5,000 people.
	   The extent of the damage from Saturday's 6.9-magnitude quake
remained unclear Thursday, with helicopter crews locating
devastated villages that hadn't appeared previously on aid
agencies' maps.
	   From helicopters, aid workers could see entire villages that had
been flattened _ some buried under landslides and others sent
tumbling into valleys below by the shaking earth.
	   In the village of Regi, perched on a peak at the end of a deep
valley, about half of the 110 houses had been destroyed. The bodies
of 11 people lay in the ruins, while medical teams treated the
injured.
	   Dozens of men used horses and donkeys to dig out the dead in the
village of Rostaq, where the quake killed 140 schoolchildren.
	   Most urgently needed by survivors were medical supplies and
food: With dwindling food stocks, some villagers were cooking
grass, said journalists aboard aid helicopters.
	   As many as 10,000 people could be facing serious food shortages,
said a spokesman for the United Nations in Faisabad.
	   The World Food Program managed to get 1.5 tons of wheat,
vegetable oil and high-protein biscuits by helicopter to remote
Shari Basurkh, very close to the quake's epicenter, where half the
village was flattened.
	   The quake struck during the late morning, when most of the men
of Shari Basurkh were in the fields, aid workers said, explaining
why most of the wounded were women, old men and children who had
been in their homes at the time of the temblor.
	   Most people hadn't eaten since the earthquake hit.
	   ``They really worry about the future ... because they don't have
any shelter, any food. I think they have a very bad future,'' said
Abdul Rahim, a doctor in the village's clinic.
	   In Rostaq, also the site of an earlier quake in February that
killed 2,300 people, U.N. aid workers were setting up bakeries to
feed the hungriest.
	   There also was a desperate need for water there: The nearest
clean water was 12 miles (19 kilometers) away after landslides
buried the villages' fresh spring.
	   Wary of more aftershocks, thousands of people slept outdoors in
heavy rainstorms while waiting for supplies and medical attention
Wednesday.
	   The rain increased the need for emergency tents and plastic
sheeting, even as it forced several aid flights to return to
Pakistan still laden with supplies.
	   Two Red Cross and one U.N. flight carrying medical workers and
supplies got through Wednesday.
	   Saturday's earthquake and the previous quake in February also
highlighted severe public health problems in Afghanistan's remote
poverty-stricken regions.
	   Many of those who sought medical treatment from aid helicopters
that had touched down appeared to suffer from diseases predating
the earthquake.

Nuclear powers gather in Geneva to discuss South Asian fears 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Meeting is scheduled to begin at 1530 GMT.
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's five original nuclear weapons powers
are hoping a high-level meeting here will put forth a united stand
against a South Asian arms race threatened by Indian and Pakistani
nuclear tests.
	   As he sent off U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from
Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton promised to work to end
nuclear competition between the Asian rivals.
	   Clinton said the tit-for-tat spate of nuclear tests was
``self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous.'' Albright said they were
an immediate threat to peace and security.
	   In Washington a top official said in the Geneva meetings
Thursday, Albright would seek common ground among the five original
nuclear powers, but would stop short of calling for joint sanctions
on Pakistan and India as that could be counterproductive.
	   ``We want to defuse the current tensions,'' Karl F. Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, told a Senate
hearing.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who is chairing the
meeting, arrived in Geneva on Wednesday afternoon.
	   Joining him and Albright will be Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, already in Switzerland on a previously planned
visit, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   The ministers were expected to hold one-on-one meetings before
their session in the European headquarters of the United Nations.
Albright was to see Tang in the morning and Primakov in the
afternoon, diplomatic sources said.
	   Experts on disarmament from the five countries met in Geneva on
Wednesday to prepare for the meeting, officials said.
	   Tang will try to stop the arms race between China's neighbors,
fearing that it could encourage other countries to obtain nuclear
weapons, Chinese officials said in Beijing.
	   ``We should urge them with one voice and make them realize it's
not in their interest,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao in Beijing.
	   The powers are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and best positioned to apply diplomatic pressure on top of
already imposed economic sanctions.
	   They also are all charter members of the nuclear club, the only
countries in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty permitted to have
nuclear stockpiles, a situation that has long irked India. Neither
India nor Pakistan have signed the treaty.
	   Inderfurth said the United States was adamant that neither India
nor Pakistan would join the club.
	   ``There is no disposition to reward any nation for blasting its
way into that nuclear-state category,'' he said.
	   Earlier in the day the room is to host the 61-nation Conference
on Disarmament for a speech by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, fresh from visits to India and Pakistan.
	   Kharrazi, who earlier expressed pleasure over Pakistan's
developing an ``Islamic bomb,'' urged India and Pakistan to work
out their differences and ease tensions in the region.
	   ``We believe in a nuclear-weapons-free in the region,'' Kharrazi
said Wednesday in New Delhi.

Conservative former transport minister quits Australian politics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ In another blow to Prime Minister
John Howard's conservative government in the run up to an election,
former transport minister John Sharp said Thursday he is quitting
politics.
	   Sharp, who resigned last year as transport minister over more
than U.S. dlrs 5,000 (8,000 Australian dollars) in falsely claimed
travel allowances, said the decision was made so he could spend
more time with his family and pursue a new career.
	   Sharp said he will not stand for re-election and will step down
then. He had served more than 10 years among the conservative
leadership in a 14-year career with the rural National Party.
	   Sharp, 43, was touted as a future National Party leader until he
was forced to resign at the height of the travel expense scandal
last September.
	   The Australian newspaper quoted unnamed party sources as saying
Sharp reached the decision after being told by Howard he would not
be restored to a Cabinet post after the next election.
	   The paper cited its sources as saying Howard had assured Sharp
at the time of his resignation from the Cabinet that he would
return as a minister after the next election, expected later this
year.
	   But the prime minister had allegedly decided to renege on the
deal, the paper said.
	   ``Howard doesn't want anyone around him who can be accused of
being incompetent with money,'' one source told the paper.

Growing concern over antibiotic use on farms AP Medical Writer 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-MED-Bacteria-Glance
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Worried scientists say farmers using
antibiotics in chickens, cattle and fruit orchards are creating
drug-resistant germs that can wind up in the food people eat, a
disturbing twist on the growing concern that antibiotics are fast
losing their power.
	   Scientists have long suspected that farming was adding to the
problem of antibiotic resistance, but now they're finding the first
strong evidence: A salmonella strain impervious to five antibiotics
is rampant in Britain. U.S. scientists this month reported it has
sickened thousands of Americans, too _ including nearly killing a
Vermont dairy farmer. Chickens sold in Minnesota were contaminated
with another germ, campylobacter, resistant to a powerful
antibiotic.
	   The U.S. government is about to impose stiff new requirements on
makers of new animal antibiotics, and the World Health Organization
is calling experts to Geneva to search for other solutions.
	   ``We're at the point right now where we ... have got to do
something,'' said Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, who
discovered the campylobacter risk. ``This can't continue.''
	   ``We know there is a problem,'' agreed WHO's Dr. Klaus Stohr.
The question is, How big a problem?
	   Some industry groups deny there's proof that antibiotics on the
farm harm human health. ``We don't know if it's true or not,'' said
Kenneth May of the National Broiler Council.
	   Others acknowledge some risk _ but insist it must be balanced
with the realization that antibiotics are vital to animal health.
	   If farm antibiotics are restricted, ``the real question is,
'What will it do to the world's food supply?''' said microbiologist
Gail Cassell of Eli Lilly and Co. ``My plea is that we need more
data.''
	   But the Food and Drug Administration considers the threat
serious enough that it is preparing stiffer rules for new animal
antibiotics, including requiring manufacturers to track treated
animals for early resistance signs.
	   ``There will be predetermined conditions of when the drug cannot
be used anymore,'' said FDA veterinary chief Stephen Sundlof. The
requirements ``may just be too unpalatable for drug companies to
accept.''
	   Antibiotics are fast losing their power against numerous germs,
particularly those spread in hospitals. Most to blame are doctors
who overprescribe drugs and patients who take them improperly.
	   But scientists say antibiotics on the farm are helping foodborne
germs mutate, too, even as the government is under pressure to
approve more agricultural drugs.
	   Almost half the 50 million pounds (23 million kilograms) of
U.S.-produced antibiotics is used in animals _ 80 percent to help
animals grow faster, not treat disease _ and 40,000 pounds (18,000
kilograms) are sprayed onto fruit trees.
	   Take fluoroquinolones, powerful antibiotics reserved for
severely ill people until 1995, when the FDA approved two of them
for poultry. They're put into chicks' drinking water to prevent a
flock-destroying disease, not kill the campylobacter also in
poultry _ the leading human food poisoner.
	   Constant fluoroquinolone exposure caused campylobacter to
rapidly mutate, said Osterholm. He tested 76 chicken products sold
in Minneapolis-St. Paul grocery stores last year. Seventy-nine
percent were contaminated with campylobacter, and 20 percent of
those were fluoroquinolone-resistant.
	   People didn't catch this resistant campylobacter before 1995,
said Dr. Frederick Angulo of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. But 13 percent of human cases tested last year were
fluoroquinolone-resistant, and the number is rising.
	   Then there's the salmonella strain that almost killed a Vermont
dairy farmer last summer, killed 14 of her cows and sickened eight
of the farmer's relatives.
	   The CDC says the family caught salmonella DT104 _ resistant to
five popular antibiotics _ by drinking unpasteurized milk and
handling sick cows. Nobody knows how the cows got sick or how DT104
spread here. It's been widespread in Britain for a decade, causing
outbreaks from sausage and chicken.
	   The CDC estimates the strain now infects 68,000 to 340,000
Americans annually.
	   Worse, salmonella DT104 in Britain appears to be losing its
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, raising concern it might become
untreatable, Sundlof said.
	   The FDA is weighing this data in debating Bayer Inc.'s request
to expand fluoroquinolones' use into cattle.
	   And the CDC is urging the Environmental Protection Agency to
refuse a Mexican company's request to treat blighted fruit trees
with gentamicin, a widely used human antibiotic.
	   Meanwhile, Europe last year banned an antibiotic used to spur
animal growth. Avoparcin is closely related to the most carefully
guarded human antibiotic, vancomycin. Since the ban, preliminary
evidence suggests vancomycin-resistant germs in poultry have
dropped, said WHO's Stohr.
	   But antibiotics do promote animal growth, important for
producing food, Stohr said. ``It's public health as well as an
economical question. It will be up to the countries to decide what
is more important.''

How germs become resistant to antiobiotics With MED-US-Powerful Bacteria 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, as doctors run out
of medicines that kill dangerous bacteria.
	   When antibiotics are used against germs, they may not kill all
the bacteria. Germs that survive can mutate into new strains that
the most commonly used antibiotics can't fight anymore. Thus,
doctors over time must try stronger and stronger antibiotics.
	   Misuse of antibiotics is the biggest problem. Experts caution
that antibiotics don't treat viruses like colds, just bacterial
infections like strep throat, so doctors must be careful in
prescribing them. And patients must take them properly, not
quitting early just because they feel better.
	   Bacteria in food sicken some 33 million Americans every year.
The vast majority recover without any medical treatment.
	   But 9,000 die and thousands of others, particularly people with
weak immune systems because of organ transplants or diseases, are
sick enough to need antibiotics; hence, the concern about drug
resistance in the food supply.
	   The government has begun new efforts to keep dangerous bacteria
out of food in the first place, which would make drug resistance a
moot point.
	   Consumers can help protect themselves: Thoroughly cook meat and
poultry to kill salmonella and campylobacter. Thoroughly cook eggs,
which also can carry salmonella. Wash cutting boards, knives and
other surfaces in contact with raw meat and poultry _ before using
the implements on any other food. And wash raw fruits and
vegetables.

Chewed gum, worn jeans whisper secrets to criminal investigators AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY308
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The bank robber wore a mask, a parka and blue
jeans. The pants told Richard Vorder Bruegge of the FBI everything
he needed to know.
	   Just like a wad of gum spoke to Dr. Dennis Asen. And a piece of
weatherstripping helped a prosecutor nail a rapist.
	   To the untrained eye, none of these items looked unusual. But
they revealed enough to play a part in criminal cases that
concluded within the past year or so. They show it doesn't take a
dramatic bloody glove or a high-tech DNA analysis to put somebody
at a crime scene.
	   Sometimes it just takes a close look.
	   Try this: Notice the string of dark and light blotches that runs
along the leg seams of well-worn jeans. The pattern looks like a
bar code. Vorder Bruegge thinks it's as distinctive as
fingerprints.
	   The pattern arises from the way jeans are made. When jeans are
stitched, the operator pushes fabric through the sewing machine by
hand, a bit at a time. The material on the bottom puckers, so when
the sewing is done, it ends up in an irregular, undulating pattern
of ridges and valleys.
	   As the jeans wear, the dye fades faster from denim that's
stitched over a ridge than over a valley. The result: light and
dark blotches with irregular spacings and widths.
	   Vorder Bruegge hopes to do mathematical analysis and compare a
lot of blue jeans to see if that bar code pattern really is
distinctive.
	   He used his observations last year, testifying in Spokane,
Washington, against the bank robber. The finely detailed 35-mm film
of the bank's camera offered him an eyeful. Beside the bar code
pattern on the outside of the right pants' leg, he saw other traits
like an H-shaped wear pattern near the left cuff.
	   The overall collection of traits matched one of 26 pairs of
jeans seized from the homes of several suspects, and none of 34
pairs offered by defense lawyers.
	   ``The bank robber depicted is wearing this pair of pants,'' he
testified while holding up a pair of Plain Pockets. ``I'm 100
percent certain.''
	   The suspect was convicted, although the verdict is on appeal.
Prosecutor Tom Rice called the blue jeans testimony pivotal.
	   The cases involving weatherstripping and chewing gum are unusual
uses of a standard forensic practice, analyzing bite marks.
	   Dr. Norman ``Skip'' Sperber, chief forensic dentist for San
Diego and Imperial Counties in California, had his doubts about the
piece of weatherstripping an investigator handed him early last
year.
	   A 16-year-old girl had been kidnapped by a man who drove her to
a secluded grove in his pickup. While she was outside the truck and
bent over near one of the doors, she bit the door's
weatherstripping in hopes of leaving evidence behind.
	   Eventually, the man was arrested. The truck had been sold, and
authorities didn't find it until three days before the trial. The
girl identified it, remembered her bite and pointed out the spot.
	   By the time Sperber got the yard-long piece of weatherstripping,
it had been two years since the girl bit it.
	   Peering closely in the sunlight, Sperber saw four tiny
rectangles, the marks of four lower teeth. One was slightly out of
line with the others _ a standout trait that makes a forensic
dentist smile. Sperber quickly turned to a cast of the girl's
teeth.
	   ``I noticed one of her lower teeth in the model sticking out,''
he said. ``I saw it was the same tooth. ... At that point I was
really kind of exhilarated.''
	   Sperber later demonstrated the match to a jury. The man was
convicted. The verdict is on appeal, although the bite marks are
not at issue.
	   The weatherstripping ``was probably very crucial evidence for
the jury,'' said prosecutor Kimberly Smith, deputy district
attorney for Tulare County in Visalia, California.
	   Like Sperber, Asen, the forensic dentist from Allentown,
Pennsylvania, was skeptical when a cop called last year about a wad
of gum. Police had found it near the body of a murdered 13-year-old
girl, and soon after arrested a suspect. Could Asen match the gum
to the man?
	   Gum is easily distorted when it's chewed, handled and spat,
making it a lousy bet for bite marks. But Asen found that this wad
had definite marks from four upper and four lower teeth. Before
long, he was in a prison to make a mold of the suspect's teeth.
	   Later, he duplicated the teeth and the piece of gum. Then he put
the models together, placing the bogus gum in a spot where one of
the teeth was noticeably out of line.
	   ``It just went, Boom, right into position,'' Asen said. A match.
	   The suspect pleaded guilty in April, so Asen never had to
testify. If he had, his evidence would have run up against a
different identification tool: Lab tests of the gum found DNA that
didn't come from the suspect.
	   Two conflicting messages from one wad of gum. What's a
prosecutor to do?
	   ``It was sort of a double-edged sword,'' said John Morganelli,
district attorney for Northampton County.
	   ``If the case had gone to trial, we decided we were going to
give this all to the jury,'' he said, ``and let them figure it
out.''

Indians reclaiming their religious artifacts from museums

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Display cases at the Denver Museum of Natural
History are going dark as American Indians assert their rights to
religious and sacred objects under a law passed by Congress.
	   Among the latest items taken down were 164 pieces, including
religious masks, reclaimed by the Hopi tribe of Arizona.
	   ``We pray for all Americans that they have a long, happy life
for no sickness. We pray for rain because we're in a dry farming
area. We need these items to keep our culture going,'' said Lee
Lomayestewa, research assistant for the Hopi tribe in Kykotsmovi,
Arizona.
	   In addition to the ceremonial masks, dolls and feathers used in
tribal rites also were returned by the museum. Lomayestewa said
that, without the artifacts, the tribe has been unable to perform
some of its important dances.
	   The Denver museum also removed Navajo ``broken nose'' fabric
masks after the tribe told officials the masks were religious
artifacts. It replaced them with a sign saying ``Specimen
temporarily removed.''
	   Tim McKeown, Washington-based federal team leader for
implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act, said more than 700 tribes have claimed more than
300,000 objects from museums and agencies since the act was passed
in 1992.
	   The figures include more than 10,000 human remains and 562
sacred objects.
	   Robert Pickering, chairman of anthropology at the museum, said
he has mixed emotions about removing items from the display cases.
On the one hand, he wants visitors to be educated about American
Indian cultures, while on the other he wants to protect their
religious freedom.
	   ``These things are part of the American culture, not just the
Indian culture. There are things that will go away and no one will
have access. That apparently is what the law intended,'' he said.
	   He said some of the items that have been returned by museums
have been buried or ritually destroyed.
	   ``The curator side of me hates to see that happen. The
anthropologist in me says if this object is important in their
religion, it's their business,'' he said.
	   Pickering said it's hard to understand a culture without
understanding its religion.
	   Under the act, museums must notify tribes of any object they
have that may have religious, funeral or patrimonial significance.
	   The Denver museum, which has more than 80,000 Indian artifacts,
including the original Folsom arrowpoint that forced scientists to
push back the timeline for American Indians on this continent by
10,000 years, had to do a complete review and notify more than 400
tribes.
	   Tribes then claim the objects they want returned, often after
visits to view the collection. Once an item is claimed, it is
immediately removed from display. Any disputes are resolved by a
seven-member arbitration committee.
	   Pickering said the act generally has worked well and promoted
greater cooperation between scientists and tribes. Tribe elders
have even helped correct historical mistakes.
	   For instance, the Hopis examined some religious regalia on
display in Denver and told curators it was wrong. Curators had
mixed up two sets. Another mistake was pointed out by members of
the Lakota tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, who noted that a
beaded hat labeled as coming from Wounded Knee had been mislabeled.
	   ``We do have errors, and as an educational institution, we want
to reduce our mistakes,'' Pickering said. ``This act has caused us
to ask questions we never asked before. Not only has it caused the
museum to review what it has in its collection, but it also has
caused the tribes to ask themselves what they consider sacred, and
what is the proper thing to do with remains.''
	   Lomayestewa said some Indian tribes have lost their religious
fervor, and are just now getting it back as they try to
re-establish their culture and reassert their rights.
	   ``We kept ours going,'' he said. ``We never lost touch with our
religion.''

Asteroid named for Silicon Valley city 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ An asteroid discovered in 1975 was
officially renamed ``San Jose'' in honor of the city that has kept
street lights dim in an effort to aid astronomers.
	   The asteroid is one of more than 2,000 rocky objects that have
been discovered circling the sun between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter.
	   Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of the University of California at
Santa Cruz and Lick Observatory director Joseph Miller recently
presented the San Jose City Council with an honorary plaque. It
includes a digital image of the asteroid and a tribute declaring,
``Through the city's understanding and efforts, the whole universe
is still visible from Lick Observatory.''
	   The cooperation began a generation ago when astronomers at the
Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, just east of San Jose,
worried that the glow from street lights in the swiftly expanding
city below would virtually blind their most powerful telescopes.
	   They brought their concerns to city officials, who developed
ordinances over the years to control light levels across San Jose's
171 square miles (440 square kilometers).
	   Most asteroids are named after mythological characters, so the
name San Jose is a bit of an anomaly.
	   The newly-named asteroid was discovered by Schelte J. Bus, now a
graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
	   A large, irregularly shaped chunk of rock, it is only faintly
visible in powerful telescopes. Fuzzy images reveal it to be about
10 or 15 miles (16 to 24 kilometers) across _ a relatively small
one compared to Ceres, the largest known asteroid, which is more
than 60 miles (95 kilometers) across.

  Study: bungee jumping a strain, but not a risk
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A healthy man or woman can go take a flying
leap, according to researchers who studied injuries among bungee
jumpers.
	   ``A jump, if performed under carefully controlled conditions,
appears to be relatively safe and causes only minor, transient
medical complaints,'' said a report in the medical journal The
Physician and Sportsmedicine. It's the first wide-ranging look at
injuries in this activity, said Dr. Craig C. Young, the lead
author.
	   The research found 42 jumpers had a total of 59 minor medical
complaints. All the injuries healed in a week, with the exception
of lacerations to one jumper who tried to grab the platform as he
was going down.
	   ``The guy was just launching, and decided he didn't want to go,
and reached back to the platform and got scraped,'' Young said.
	   The study was done at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1994 by
researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. They
asked 200 jumpers to take part, and 100 agreed. The average age was
26; 74 were men and 26 were women.
	   Strictly speaking, the study's findings would only apply to
young, healthy adults, Young said. But the jumps seemed to be safe
enough to go a bit beyond that, he said. ``If a person is healthy,
with no disease processes, they would not have a problem no matter
what their age was,'' he said.
	     ___
  Cholesterol-lowering drugs can also help people with moderate
levels
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Six million healthy Americans with ordinary
cholesterol levels might benefit from taking cholesterol-lowering
drugs, researchers say.
	   Healthy men and women taking lovastatin, sold as Mevacor,
reduced their risk of serious heart trouble 37 percent, according
to a five-year study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
	   Currently, national guidelines recommend cholesterol-lowering
drugs only for people with high cholesterol.
	   ``We estimate that 6 million Americans not recommended for drug
treatment may benefit'' from lovastatin, said the authors, led by
Dr. John R. Downs of Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air
Force Base in San Antonio.
	   The findings were also released in November at an American Heart
Association meeting and were reported by The Associated Press at
the time.
	   The study involved 6,604 men and postmenopausal women ages 45 to
73 whose average total cholesterol was 221, higher than the
recommended cutoff of 200 but typical for Americans. ``Good''
cholesterol, or HDL, levels averaged 36, lower than the recommended
cutoff of 40. ``Bad'' cholesterol, or LDL, averaged 150, higher
than ideal but also typical.
	   Half of the participants got lovastatin, half got dummy pills.
	   Overall, there were 299 instances of heart attack, serious heart
pain or fatal cardiac arrest.
	   Women taking lovastatin had 46 percent lower risk of heart
trouble than the other women. Men on the drug had a 37 percent
lower risk.
	   However, an accompanying editorial noted that that
cholesterol-lowering drugs _ lovastatin is the first of five
similar ``statin'' drugs _ cost dlrs 900 to dlrs 1,800 a year at
the levels used in the study. The drugs also must be taken for
life.

Report: Korean-American pastor faces spy charges in North Korea 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A 73-year-old Korean-American man has
been arrested in North Korea on spy charges, a Seoul newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   The Joongang Daily News said Lee Kwang-duk, a Christian minister
living in Los Angeles, was arrested shortly after entering North
Korea last month.
	   Lee arrived in his native North Korea on May 20 by way of
Yanbian, a Chinese province bordering the communist North, the
paper said.
	   Lee, a frequent traveller to North Korea, was visiting his
relatives in the North's Rajin-Sonbong free trade area when he was
arrested, the paper said.
	   The pastor, who immigrated to the United States from South
Korea, faced spy charges but details were unavailable, the paper
said.
	   Joongang attributed its account to an unidentified South Korean
official. No responsible government officials were reachable for
comment on Thursday, a national holiday for local elections.
	   Lee is believed to be the first Korean-American to face spy
charges in North Korea, Joongang said.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They remain technically at war,
having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Nissan to cut production at Tennessee plant 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co. plans to cut production at its
Smyrna, Tennessee plant by 25 percent this year due to sluggish
U.S. sales, a Nissan spokesman said Thursday.
	   Nissan will reduce output at the plant to about 300,000 vehicles
this year from 400,000 last year by shutting assembly lines every
Friday until early October, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Most employees will be given the day off with pay, although some
may be asked to do non-production work at the plant, he said.
Nissan, however, will not layoff any workers, the spokesman added.
	   The cut is designed to trim inventories which have grown amid
sluggish sales in the United States. Nissan makes its Ultima and
Sentra sedans, and Frontier pickups at the plant.
	   Sluggish small car sales in the United States had forced Nissan
earlier this year to freeze hiring, cut overtime at the plant, and
idle production lines for longer than usual during the Easter and
Memorial Day holidays.
	   Combined sales of vehicles produced at the Tennessee plant fell
by 6 percent last year and continue to be weak this year.
	   Nissan has said it is considering moving production of the
Maxima sedan from Japan to the Tennessee plant, though not until
after 2000.

U.N. inspectors challenge Baghdad's claims it has destroyed illegal weapons 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After providing evidence that Iraq is
still hiding illegal weapons, the chief U.N. inspector spells out
Thursday what steps he believes Baghdad must take before the
Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions.
	   Richard Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, is also expected to tell the council what his teams
have learned about Iraq's efforts to conceal banned materials and
mislead the inspectors over the past seven years.
	   During an all-day session, Butler presented aerial photographs
and other documents to justify his claims that Iraq has failed to
comply with U.N. orders to destroy all long-range missiles and
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the council to lift sanctions
slapped on Iraq in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein sent his
forces into Kuwait, triggering the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   Butler hopes his presentations will convince the council that
Iraq is wrong when it claims to have complied with U.N. orders.
Russia, China and France have challenged some of Butler's
conclusions.
	   Following Wednesday's session, diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Butler showed photographs which
suggested that the Iraqis had buried some missile parts and then
dug them up after the inspectors left.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's report ``has dealt
a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility'' with ``document and
charts that catalogue the gaps and inconsistencies in Iraqi claims
in the chemical, biological and other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
and indicated that Iraq has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions. ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to
do,'' he said.
	   But diplomatic sources said French Ambasador Alain Dejammet
argued that despite changing its story on several occasions, Iraq
had ultimately provided accurate information in some areas.
	   Dejammet urged Butler to outline clearly what steps Iraq must
take to satisfy the inspectors. Diplomats said Russian envoys also
questioned some of Butler's conclusions.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as
Saddam remains in power.
	   On Tuesday, an Iraqi delegation, led by Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argued that Baghdad has provided all
information on its weapons programs. British and American diplomats
said they were not convinced.
	   Pressure has mounted on Butler since Secretary-General Kofi
Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open Saddam's
palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.

Five months after daring escape, El Duque makes big league debut AP Baseball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous to update with final score
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He risked his life on a flimsy boat, fleeing
Cuba the day after Christmas and floating toward an uncertain
future.
	   And on Wednesday night _ thanks to a dog bite _ El Duque
completed another sort of journey.
	   Now pitching for the New York Yankees, Orlando Hernandez.
	   Cheered on by chanting fans waving Cuban flags and encouraged by
his half-brother, World Series MVP Livan Hernandez of the Florida
Marlins, ``The Duke'' made a dazzling U.S. major league debut,
holding Tampa Bay to one run in seven innings in the Yankees' 7-1
victory.
	   Hernandez, wearing his navy socks high and his cap pulled down
low, showed off his impressive assortment of pitches from the
start, striking out Quinton McCracken to begin the game.
	   Hernandez allowed five hits, including a homer by Fred McGriff,
struck out seven and walked two. Mixing fastballs, slow curves and
sidearm deliveries, he shut down the expansion Devil Rays and left
with a 7-1 lead to a standing ovation from the crowd and
congratulations from his teammates.
	   ``I know he's got to be thinking about what he went through the
last year of his life,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said before the
game. ``When he boarded that boat, he wasn't sure what was ahead.
It takes a lot of bravery.''
	   One of the most heralded pitchers in Cuban history, Hernandez
got his chance when Wednesday night's scheduled starter, David
Cone, was bitten on his right index finger by his mother's
4-month-old Jack Russell terrier.
	   Hernandez already was in town because the Yankees thought they
might need him Tuesday night to start in place of David Wells, who
had a sore shoulder.
	   ``I wish him luck and congratulate him on his big league
debut,'' said Livan, the losing pitcher Wednesday afternoon in the
Marlins' 5-1 defeat at Chicago. ``I'm very happy. I hope he doesn't
do as bad as I did today.
	   ``I talked to him last five days ago. I have been calling him,
but he must have turned off his cell phone,'' he said.
	   The Marlins, as it turned out, left Wrigley Field to take a
flight to New York, where they play the Yankees in an interleague
series this weekend.
	   Since his defection from Cuba, where he earned about dlrs 10 a
month as a physical therapist, Hernandez signed a dlrs 6.6 million,
four-year contract with the Yankees and proved he could pitch in
the minors.
	   At Triple-A Columbus, Hernandez was 6-0 with a 3.83 ERA in seven
starts, striking out 59 in 42 1-3 innings. He last started for the
Clippers on Thursday, beating Ottawa 9-6.

Eds: UPDATES
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Kerry Wood was his usual solid self, and Sammy
Sosa hit a two-run homer run Wednesday as the Chicago Cubs beat the
Florida Marlins 5-1.
	   While Livan Hernandez (3-4) was getting rocked for 10 hits and
five runs in seven innings, Wood (6-2) was rolling. He struck out
nine batters and gave up five hits in eight innings as he won his
fifth straight decision.
	   The Cubs (34-24) moved 10 games over .500 for the first time
since finishing the 1989 season at 93-69 _ the last time Chicago
made the postseason.
	   Scott Servais hit a two-run double in the fourth to put the Cubs
up 2-1 and Sosa hit his 16th home run of the year, and seventh in
six games, to make it 4-1 in the fifth.
  Giants 8, Reds 5
	   In San Francisco, Brian Johnson hit two home runs for the second
time in four days as San Francisco won its sixth straight win.
	   Shawn Estes (5-5) won his third straight decision, carrying a
four-hit shutout into the seventh before the Reds touched him for
five runs.
	   Johnson, who also hit two home runs against Arizona on Sunday,
had three hits and is 14-for-38 with seven home runs and 13 RBIs
since coming off the disabled list May 20.
	   Johnson homered against Brett Tomko (5-4) to lead off the third
and added a two-run shot off reliever Scott Sullivan in the fifth.
	   Robb Nen got his 16th save in 17 chances.
  Pirates 3, Mets 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Jon Lieber outdueled Rick Reed with eight shutout
innings, and Aramis Ramirez's first career hit helped Pittsburgh
finish off a three-game sweep of New York.
	   Ramirez was 0-for-24 in the majors before his two-run double in
the seventh. Jermaine Allensworth broke a 1-for-21 slump with
leadoff triple in the first, and scored on Al Martin's ground out.
	   The Mets came into the series with a nine-game winning streak,
only to be swept by Pittsburgh for the first time since June 24-26,
1995. New York had only five runs in the three games after scoring
51 in its previous six. Pittsburgh has won five straight.
	   Lieber (3-7) allowed four hits in eight innings. Jason
Christiansen pitched the ninth for his first save of the season.
Reed dropped to 6-3.
  Expos 3, Phillies 2
	   In Philadelphia, Robert Perez's two-out RBI single in the eighth
snapped a tie and helped Carlos Perez get his sixth straight
victory as Montreal beat Philadelphia.
	   Carlos Perez (6-3) gave up seven hits and two runs, walked none
and struck out four in his second complete game of the season. He
hasn't lost since April 27 at St. Louis.
	   Wayne Gomes (4-2), who relieved starter Matt Beech in the
eighth, took the loss. Gomes allowed three hits and one run in
two-thirds of an inning.
	   The Expos scored the winning run in the eighth when Vladimir
Guerrero singled, stole second and came home on Robert Perez's
single to left. Guerrero was 3-for-4 with a homer, and Rondell
White also homered.
  Braves 5, Brewers 2  
	   In Milwaukee, Tom Glavine joined Atlanta teammate Greg Maddux
and Pittsburgh's Jason Schmidt as the National League's only
eight-game winners , allowing only one run in 6 1-3 innings against
Milwaukee.
	   Glavine (8-2) allowed six hits and had six strikeouts in his
fourth straight victory. Mark Wohlers pitched the ninth for his
eighth save, completing the Braves' three-game sweep.
	   Ryan Klesko doubled in two runs off Jeff Juden (5-4) in the
first inning. Bobby Hughes homered for the Brewers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting Japan's sluggish economy, sales of
imported cars, buses and trucks fell 15.6 percent in May from the
year-earlier month to 19,335 units, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said Thursday.
	   It was the 14th straight month of declines.
	   The sale of imported passenger cars was down 13.1 percent to
18,476, while the sale of imported trucks plunged 47.9 percent to
859. No imported buses were sold during the month.
	   The figures were seen as another indication of consumer caution

revive it, including the announcement last month of this country's

Victims still buried in smashed German train; at least 100 dead

	   ESCHEDE, Germany (AP) _ Rescuers at Germany's deadliest postwar
train wreck worked with cranes and floodlights early Thursday to
uncover victims buried when a high-speed train derailed, jackknifed
and smashed broadside into an overpass.
	   State officials said at least 100 people were killed in
Wednesday's accident at Eschede in northern Germany, along the
Munich-to-Hamburg line. Scores were injured.
	   The lead locomotive of the Inter-City Express broke loose at 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour, leaving behind 12 passenger cars
and another locomotive that jumped tracks and crunched together
like an accordion.
	   The pileup undermined the bridge, and two first-class cars were
wedged underneath when the concrete structure crashed down during
the chaotic accident. Other cars were stacked lengthwise in front
of the collapsed overpass.
	   As dawn broke Thursday, emergency workers still struggled with
the delicate task of lifting huge chunks of the overpass with
cranes to reach the two buried cars, where rescuers expected to
find more bodies.
	   Police at the scene said 78 bodies had been recovered, and that
120 people were hurt.
	   Military tanks pulled the rear locomotive away from the
wreckage, as search dogs sniffed through other train parts for
remaining survivors.
	   It remained unclear why the first locomotive, which went through
the bridge unscathed, had decoupled and why the rest of the train
derailed.
	   One passenger from a rear car told SAT 1 TV that he felt a
jarring rattle ahead of the accident, which subsided but then
restarted just before the impact.
	   ``I held on and ducked down because you had the feeling you'd be
thrown through the air,'' Wolf-Ruediger Schliebener said Wednesday.
``Thank God, it came to a standstill.''
	   As screams rang out from the wounded, dazed survivors had
staggered with bloodied hands toward residents who came running out
of houses just 50 yards (150 feet) away. Splintered glass covered
the ground after the late-morning accident.
	   Within an hour, rescue workers swarmed to the scene, and
helicopters began bringing the wounded to regional hospitals.
	   The accident was the worst on Germany's premier high-speed ICE
line, inaugurated in 1991 and prized for both its speed and safety,
and the country's deadliest train accident since World War II.
	   The Lower Saxony state interior ministry, which said at least
100 people were dead, had earlier estimated that as many as 300 or
more were injured.
	   The accounting of dead and injured was hampered by the severity
of the mangled mess and because authorities were unsure how many
people had been on board the train.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, informed of the tragedy after arriving
in Italy for meetings with Premier Romano Prodi, appeared shaken by
the news and called his visit short.
	   ``So many dead ... It's a tragedy,'' Kohl, his face tight, said
Wednesday in Bologna with Prodi at his side. ``Excuse me, but I
must return home right away.
	   Hundreds of people, moved by word of the tragedy, gathered at
Red Cross stations across the country to donate blood.
	   More than 1,100 rescue workers were at the scene, including
trauma surgeons and border patrol personnel who helped free
passengers trapped inside the rail cars.
	   The locomotive driver, oblivious to the catastrophe behind him,
had kept driving through the small train station at Eschede, 35
miles north of Hanover.
	   The station master finally hit the emergency brakes, bringing
the engine to a halt more than a mile from the overpass.
	   The ICE train connects all major cities at speed up to 280
kilometers (175 miles) an hour, cutting travel time from Munich to
Hamburg - a distance of more than 950 kilometers (about 600 miles)
by more than two hours.
	   The Munich-Hamburg train that crashed Wednesday was a
first-generation ICE model powered by two electric-powered
locomotives, and with a capacity of 759 passengers.
	   At top speed the train requires 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) to
come to an emergency stop.

Dollar rises, stocks bounce back moderately 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
morning as many traders adjusted dollar positions amid continuing
uncertainty over Russian financial markets. Stock prices bounced
back moderately.
	   The dollar bought 138.08 yen, up 0.32 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 138.75 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 150.35 points,
or 0.98 percent, to 15,497.35 points at the end of the morning
session. On Wednesday, the index lost 207.45 points, or 1.33
percent.
	   ``Position adjustment is the order of the day, although there's
no change in the overall dollar buying trend against the yen,''
said Minoru Shioiri, deputy foreign exchange manager at Nippon
Credit Bank.
	   Japanese institutional investors bought the dollar at 138.00
yen, keeping the currency from falling below that, traders said.
	   Worries that Russia may be the next victim of the financial
turmoil that has swept through many Asian economies have hung over
world financial markets in recent days.
	   Investors are assuming that the Russian situation will be the
prime topic of discussion at the Paris meeting of finance officials
from the Group of Seven industrialized nations next week.
	   Meanwhile, share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange headed into
positive territory following a rise in futures prices at midday
Thursday, causing investors to think that public pension funds
would be among buyers.
	   ``The market appears to have confirmed its floor at 15,000
points,'' said Yoshio Watanabe, a manager in the derivatives
section of Toyo Securities.
	   Shares were also supported on buying from foreign investors.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.39 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,211.72. The
TOPIX lost 7.64 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day.
	   Prices had slipped at the start of Thursday's trading amid
persistent worries that Japan's stagnant economy is getting worse.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond edged up to 1.165 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.150
percent, driving its price down to 112.31 yen from 112.43 yen.

U.N. inspectors challenge Baghdad's claims it has destroyed illegal weapons 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING
Eds: RECAPS previous; meeting resumes at 1430 GMT Thursday.
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After providing evidence that Iraq is
still hiding illegal weapons, the chief U.N. inspector spells out
Thursday what steps he believes Baghdad must take before the
Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions.
	   Richard Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, is also expected to tell the council what his teams
have learned about Iraq's efforts to conceal banned materials and
mislead the inspectors over the past seven years.
	   During an all-day session, Butler presented aerial photographs
and other documents to justify his claims that Iraq has failed to
comply with U.N. orders to destroy all long-range missiles and
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.
	   That is the main condition for the council to lift sanctions
slapped on Iraq in 1990 after President Saddam Hussein sent his
forces into Kuwait, triggering the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
	   Butler hopes his presentations will convince the council that
Iraq is wrong when it claims to have complied with U.N. orders.
Russia, China and France have challenged some of Butler's
conclusions.
	   Following Wednesday's session, diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Butler showed photographs which
suggested that the Iraqis had buried some missile parts and then
dug them up after the inspectors left.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Butler's report ``has dealt
a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility'' with ``document and
charts that catalogue the gaps and inconsistencies in Iraqi claims
in the chemical, biological and other fields.''
	   Richardson said the evidence showed a ``pattern of concealment''
and indicated that Iraq has ``a long way to go'' to satisfy
conditions for ending sanctions. ``Iraq has a lot of explaining to
do,'' he said.
	   But diplomatic sources said French Ambasador Alain Dejammet
argued that despite changing its story on several occasions, Iraq
had ultimately provided accurate information in some areas.
	   Dejammet urged Butler to outline clearly what steps Iraq must
take to satisfy the inspectors. Diplomats said Russian envoys also
questioned some of Butler's conclusions.
	   Iraq claims the United States and Britain are manipulating the
inspection program to justify maintaining sanctions as long as
Saddam remains in power.
	   On Tuesday, an Iraqi delegation, led by Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, argued that Baghdad has provided all
information on its weapons programs. British and American diplomats
said they were not convinced.
	   Pressure has mounted on Butler since Secretary-General Kofi
Annan signed a deal with the Iraqis in February to open Saddam's
palaces and other sensitive sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That defused the possibility of U.S.-led military strikes to
force access But the deal has also put pressure on the inspectors
to declare Iraq free or weapons or prove it is not.

Stars avoid eliminiation with 3-2 overtime win over Red Wings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Jamie Langenbrunner's 70-foot (21-meter) slap shot
from beyond the blue line gave Dallas a 3-2 overtime victory over
the Detroit Red Wings Wednesday night and kept the Stars alive in
their Western Conference playoff series.
	   Game 6 of the series will be played in Detroit on Friday night
with the Red Wings leading the best-of-7 series 3-2.
	   Langenbrunner's rocket shot came just 36 seconds into the
overtime. The puck took a little hop on the soft ice and beat Chris
Osgood on his stick side.
	   Guy Carbonneau's wrist shot into the upper left-hand corner of
the net beat Osgood on his glove side to tie the game 2-2 with 1:25
left. Carbonneau was knocked to the ice and got up just in time to
receive a perfect pass from Sergei Zubov.
	   Igor Larionov's goal at 16:20 in the second period appeared to
be the game-winner until the 38-year-old Carbonneau, playing in his
190th playoff game, caused the sellout crowd of 16,928 fans to go
wild over his critical shot.
	   Larionov scored when he scrambled to his skates after being
knocked down by Craig Muni. He took a pass from Niklas Lidstrom and
ripped a 30-foot slap shot from the top of the left circle by
goalie Ed Belfour, who looked at his glove in disbelief as the puck
ripped into the net.
	   The Stars also thought they had scored in the second period on a
shot by Mike Modano. Osgood made an acrobatic save with his
blocker, just keeping the puck out of the net. Although Dallas fans
booed and pelted the ice with objects, referee Kerry Fraser ruled
no goal.
	   Dallas scored first on a rebound shot by Mike Keane late in the
opening period. A shot by Craig Ludwig was stopped by Osgood, but
the goalie couldn't control the puck. Keane beat Osgood to the
stick side with a quick wrist shot just outside the crease.

Japanese airline to fly jets painted with ``Pokemon'' characters

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese airline will soon be flying two jumbo
jets painted with characters from the enormously popular
``Pokemon'' television cartoon, an airline spokesman said Thursday.
	   Kazutoshi Tsujimura of All Nippon Airways Co. said the airline
decided to paint two of its B747-400s to provide children with ``a
bright dream.''
	   ``Pokemon,'' an abbreviation for ``pocket monsters'' in
Japanese, made headlines in December when nearly 700 Japanese
viewers _ mostly young children _ suffered blackouts, convulsions
and nausea after watching one 30-minute episode of the hit TV
series.
	   Broadcaster TV Tokyo stopped airing the show for four months,
but resumed broadcasts in April with a toned down version
accompanied by warnings to viewers not to sit too close to the
screen.
	   A TV Tokyo investigation found that flashy special effects may
have caused the sudden illnesses, but now says the problem has been
fixed.
	   ANA, which in the past has flown a passenger aircraft painted
with a large whale, said it was spending 50 million yen (dlrs
362,000) to draw the cartoon characters on the two aircraft.
	   Cabin attendants aboard the two jets will also wear aprons
designed with some of the cartoon's characters, Tsujimura said.
	   The introduction of the painted jets will also coincide with the
scheduled release of a ``Pokemon'' movie in Japan, Tsujimura said.
	   The two jets, each capable of carrying 569 passengers, will be
flown only on domestic routes from July 2 through late August,
Tsujimura said.
	   ``Pokemon'' tells the story of a young boy leading a group of
friendly critters against a gang of animals trained by villains.
The television show is slated to make its debut in the United
States and Canada in September.

Report: Indonesia's private airlines face collapse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ All of Indonesia's major private
airlines will collapse soon if the nation's battered currency does
not strengthen, an airline industry official has warned.
	   Earlier this week, the country's number three airline Sempati
announced it was closing its operations because of Indonesia's
prolonged monetary crisis.
	   The official Antara news agency Thursday quoted Benny Rungkat,
secretary general of the Indonesian Air Carriers' Association, as
saying others were also in danger.
	   ``I think all national airlines are now in the same situation.
If Sempati Air has gone bankrupt, I think Bouraq, Mandala and
Merpati are also on the brink of bankruptcy,'' Rungkat said.
	   Rungkat suggested the airlines combine their funds and forces
and conduct commercial flights jointly.
	   He also suggested that Indonesia's cash-strapped government
might try to help Merpati, the second largest carrier.
	   The report did not elaborate and there was no immediate comment
from officials.
	   Indonesia's airlines have registered big losses because of
Asia's economic crisis and the weak rupiah, which has lost more
than 70 percent of its value since July 1997.
	   Most of them, including state-owned Garuda, have drastically cut
services.
	   Much of the costs borne by the airlines are in dollars, but
their revenue is mainly in rupiah.
	   Sempati was run by Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, the youngest
son of ex-President Suharto, who resigned on May 21 following a
wave of protests and riots.
	   Indonesia's economy is expected to contract by at least 10
percent this year. Unemployment is soaring and some predict
inflation could reach 85 percent by year's end.

Three airlines set for consolidation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Meeting a government drive to boost
profits and improve safety, Taiwan's UNI Airlines said Thursday it
is merging with two other carriers.
	   The government's Fair Trade Commission gave its approval
Wednesday for UNI to absorb Formosa and Taiwan airlines. The move
will give UNI 32 planes on 23 domestic and five foreign routes,
said Paul Cheng, UNI's senior vice president.
	   Merging the airlines will cut costs by 10-15 percent, giving the
airline a competitive edge in the crowded industry, Cheng said.
	   ``The deal is particularly efficient because there is very
little overlap in routes between the airlines now,'' Cheng said.
``Now everywhere in Taiwan, we can fly.''
	   Taiwan's government pushed for consolidation following a string
of accidents this year, including the crash of a China Airlines
Airbus on Feb. 16 in which 202 people died.
	   Few carriers make money in the domestic market, and a profusion
of airlines and types are blamed for maintainence and safety
problems.
	   EVA Airlines, which is owned by the Evergreen Group, will
control a roughly 60 percent stake in the expanded UNI, Cheng said.
EVA now holds 75 percent of UNI and Taiwan Airlines, and 26 percent
of Great China, Cheng said.
	   He said UNI expects approval from the Securities and Futures
Commission and Transportation Ministry by June 30.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He risked his life on a flimsy boat, fleeing
Cuba the day after Christmas and floating toward an uncertain
future.
	   And on Wednesday night _ thanks to a dog bite _ El Duque
completed another sort of journey.
	   Now pitching for the New York Yankees, Orlando Hernandez.
	   Cheered on by chanting fans waving Cuban flags and encouraged by
his half-brother, World Series MVP Livan Hernandez of the Florida
Marlins, ``The Duke'' made a dazzling U.S. major league debut,
holding Tampa Bay to one run in seven innings in the Yankees' 7-1
victory.
	   The crowd of 27,291 gave Hernandez a standing ovation when he
walked off after his 117th and final pitch.
	   ``It was very emotional because it was a long time since I
pitched before so many fans,'' Hernandez said through interpreter
Joe Cubas, his agent.
	   ``When I left the field, I felt a great deal of emotion. My eyes
were watery.''
	   After the last out, Hernandez walked up to plate umpire Larry
McCoy.
	   ``He asked me for something, but he doesn't speak any English,''
McCoy said. ``So I thought he wanted the ball and I flipped him
one.''
	   But Hernandez really wanted the lineup card from his first win,
and Yankees manager Joe Torre got that from McCoy for his new
pitcher.

Blue Jays beat Tigers 5-1; Orioles defeat Red Sox 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens pitched a four-hitter for his first
complete game of the season and Shawn Green drove in two runs as
the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Detroit Tigers 5-1 Wednesday night.
	   Clemens (6-6), who had lost three of his previous four starts,
struck out 10 and walked none as the Jays ended a three-game losing
streak and handed the Tigers their fourth consecutive loss.
	   Seth Greisinger (0-1) lost in his major-league debut, giving up
five runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings.
  Orioles 3, Red Sox 0  
	   In Boston, Doug Johns allowed four hits over 7 1-3 innings and
Eric Davis had an RBI double as the Baltimore Orioles won for the
eighth time in 11 games.
	   Johns (2-1), back at full strength after a stint on the disabled
list because of insomnia, didn't give up a hit until Damon Buford's
leadoff single in the sixth. He has allowed only four earned runs
in 24 2-3 innings in his last three starts.
	   Arthur Rhodes completed the shutout _ the first against Boston
this season _ with one-hit relief for his second save.
  Yankees 7, Devil Rays 1  
	   In New York, Orlando Hernandez, who risked his life in defecting
from Cuba on a flimsy boat, pitched seven strong innings in his
major-league debut as New York beat Tampa Bay.
	   Cheered on by a crowd of 27,291 waving Cuban flags, ``El Duque''
limited the Devil Rays to one run and five hits. The half-brother
of World Series MVP Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins struck
out seven and walked two.
	   Scott Brosius supported Hernandez with a pair of two-run
doubles. The Yankees won their third in a row, defeating the
expansion Devil Rays in their first-ever meeting.
  Twins 3, Indians 2  
	   In Minneapolis, Marty Cordova's two-out, two-run single in the
eighth inning gave the Twins a victory over the Cleveland Indians.
	   The loss was just the second in nine games for the Indians, who
still lead the second-place Twins by 7 1/2 games in the AL Central.
	   Cleveland took a 2-1 lead in the seventh when David Justice led
off with his 11th homer of the season. But the Twins rallied in the
eighth, when Otis Nixon drew a walk from Bartolo Colon (4-4) and
moved to third on Paul Molitor's two-out single.
	   Paul Assenmacher relieved Colon and walked pinch-hitter Alex
Ochoa to load the bases before Jose Mesa came in and allowed
Cordova's single on his first pitch.
  White Sox 10, Royals 5  
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, one night after brawling with the
Anaheim Angels, the Kansas City Royals went down without a fight.
	   Wil Cordero went 4-for-5 with three doubles and Magglio Ordonez
had a career-high four RBIs as the Chicago White Sox beat the
Royals for their 10th straight victory in Kauffman Stadium.
	   There were no beanballs or brawls like the ones that marred
Kansas City's 7-5 loss to Anaheim on Tuesday night. There were 12
ejections in that game and more penalties are expected to be
announced Friday by AL president Gene Budig, who attended the
fight-filled game.
	   Robin Ventura had three of Chicago's 15 hits and Cordero drove
in three runs and scored three times, making a winner of Carlos
Castillo (2-4) in relief of Jason Bere. Castillo pitched 3 2-3
scoreless innings.
