women clergy

What other countries besides the United States are considering or have approved women as clergy persons?

To be relevant, a document must indicate either a country where a woman has been installed as clergy or a country that is considering such an installation.  The clergy position must be as church pastor rather than some other church capacity (e.g., nun or choir member).
